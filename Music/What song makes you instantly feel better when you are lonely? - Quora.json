            "answer_text": "Kashmir gives me a feeling of connecting with something bigger, something metaphysical, something worth more than any troubles the world might present. The radio overplayed it though, sadly.  Poorboy Shuffle is another great song. So, is Effigy. From the same album I\u2019d take either of those or this one, \u201cSide Of the Road\u201d to cheer me up or relieve any sombre mood. It\u2019s Creedence Clearwater Revival.  This one\u2019s hard not to stave away any negative thoughts It\u2019s the Talking Heads -Naive Melody or \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d.  Someone once said to me \u201cU2 broke my heart\u201d. They broke mine too. Before they did, though, they put this song on The Unforgettable Fire LP -It\u2019s called Elvis Presley and America. It was a go to sometimes. As was the entire album and Boy and War.  Lots of these but just one more here on this answer for getting me out of a funk this works every time. It\u2019s old and it\u2019s skin is cold\u2026but if it works, don\u2019t fix it. Shaman\u2019s Blues by The Doors.  ",
