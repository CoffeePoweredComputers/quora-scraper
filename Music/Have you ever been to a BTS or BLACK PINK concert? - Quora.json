            "answer_text": "I went to a BTS concert last year (it was on their lys: speak yourself tour). Tickets were slightly pricey, but it was so worth the investment. The venue wasn\u2019t that large compared to some of the other stadiums they\u2019ve performed at, and I wasn\u2019t seated too far from the stage so I got a decent view of them. It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling, having your idol right there. The seats were completely full, and the energy there was great. We were doing fanchants for the MVs even before BTS came out. I swear, the anticipation and excitement- And when they finally came out, boy did they not disappoint. Their stage presence was so good. They hyped the crowd up so much. Their performances were *chef\u2019s kiss* WOW. Their vocals, their raps, their dancing was all so damn perfect, idk how they kept it up for so long. I remember there was some problem with the translator so they had a bit of trouble interacting with the audience. But they handled it so professionally and didn\u2019t freeze up. It was so cute and funny. (They tried to make us do the wave but we were so confused lol) And then they sang Jimin happy birthday and he was so happy im ??? Mikrokosmos was the last song they performed and I almost cried. Im never forgetting that day, ever in my entire life. So yes, based on my experience, BTS\u2019 concert was amazing and I 10/10 highly recommend. The only bad thing was that it ended. (I\u2019ve never been to a Blackpink concert so idk how it\u2019d be like) ",

Before the concert, I was a Ros\u00e9 bias but after I became a Jennie bias. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate Ros\u00e9 any less, it\u2019s just that Jennie\u2019s performance and interaction on stage just captured me. Against some popular opinions, she seemed so lively on stage and happy. And all their songs are BOPS, too bad there are not a lot of them but what can I do. I would definitely attend another one of their concerts! ",

But, I am army. i started stanning them early 2019 so I was new to them (also I was a casual fan for a bit) so I didn\u2019t bother with concerts. the second half of the year I really wanted to go and attend a concert of theirs but, I didn\u2019t have the money\u2026 (still don\u2019t ) now this whole virus thing has been happening and no one can go. i still really wanna go to a bts concert \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14  It looks like an incredible experience. \ud83d\ude2d now, blackpink?
