            "answer_text": "Vibrato is the natural state of the voice. You should not need to \u2018push yourself\u2019 to create vibrato, so long as you sing with as little tension in your vocal folds as possible. The way to create straight tone (i.e no vibrato), or as close to true straight tone as possible is to tense those muscles letting your vocal folds vibrate so that they produce a thin, single note. However, you are probably talking about operatic \u2018flourished\u2019 vibrato. The truth is, you have to learn to relax your muscles, especially those in your neck and throat and let the voice soar. If you try too hard, vibrato will never happen. This is not to say that diaphragmatic support isn\u2019t necessary - it\u2019s vital and will likely create tension in your abdomen if you are using it correctly, but for true vibrato to happen, you must relax your voice. There are exercises that can help, but many of them just involve singing a single note on an \u2018Ah\u2019 vowel, and trying to feel the sense of filling the room in the back of your throat. You\u2019d have better luck working on releasing tension etc with a singing teacher though. Only so far anyone can guide you in a text guide when it comes to a physical skill. ",
