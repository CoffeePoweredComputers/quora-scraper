            "answer_text": "I should advise you that as I am a professional pianist, I'm having to stifle a nausea reflex as I answer this question. It so happens that I was recently reading answers on Quora to the question of whether all music is haram in Islam, and based on one of these answers I am inclined to say that it depends on the style and context of music being used. If the music is merely light \"entertainment\" or in profane contexts, then yes. If it is used in the worshipful context, then no. I should also add my immense relief hearing that, to the best of my knowledge, there are no conservative Muslims on the juries of international music competitions, or working as music critics for major western newspapers.

            "answer_text": "Hi! Answering questions related to Islam is not something that everyone of us is capable of because only muslim scholars can answer them, as they are the most notable sources we can trust. Though, I can share my opinion (I am a muslim) on how I see the act of playing the piano from islamic perspective. Music is haram in Islam. So are instruments. But as long as I remember, I think there are categories. For ex. hitting instruments (drums) are allowed, but string, wind and other instruments (including the piano) are not. Music is seen as a way of getting your soul \u201cdrunk\u201d, which leads to unprepared behaviour and forgetting the Allah, which is something quite terrible in Islam. I hope you benefit something from sharing my perspective of music in Islam. ",
