            "answer_text": "The Doors choose its band name based on a book by Aldous Huxley called \u201cThe Doors to Perception\u201d which is about profound experiences after his consumption of hallucinatory drug called mescaline ( extracted from the cactus Peyote). This book turn in turn is based on a phrase from a 1793 poem of William Blake called \u201cThe Marriage of Heaven and Hell\u201d. It says \u201cIf the doors are perception were cleansed , everything would appear to man as it is: infinite\u201d The beat generation famous authors like William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg also were inspired by these hallucinogens. These artists in turn influenced Rock Bands and some of them selected their names after scanning a few pages of their favourite beat generation writers. The band \u201cSteely Dan\u201d chose its name after glancing through a book called the Naked Lunch written by Burroughs The Doors -particularly Jim Morrison certainly lived up to the title and freely indulged in drugs and booze ",

            "answer_text": "They are named after Aldous Huxley's 1954 book The Doors of Perception, which was about Huxley's experience with psychedelic drugs, namely mescaline: Doors 1965 Huxley in turn took his title from the visionary work The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, by the English poet and artist William Blake (1757\u20131827).  (Image source: OUP facsimile paperback edition of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.) If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. Blake wrote his works, hand-engraved them, and printed them himself, besides working as a professional printer and engraver. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is a hybrid of prose and poetry which was his first attempt to present his basic philosophy. Jim Morrison, who was quite the reader, was aware of Blake's work and he certainly knew where Huxley had got the name from. Much of The Marriage would sound pretty good recited over a moody Doorsian backdrop. I thoroughly recommend Blake's work. He can hardly be summarised by me in an answer about where the Doors got their name, but The Marriage of Heaven and Hell reads almost like a manifesto for the 1960s, in spite of having been written in around 1793.
