            "answer_text": "Describing sound with words is difficult. I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201csofter\u201d. My guess that you want it to have less punch or less midrange. A compressor can reduce or control punch. (Punch is defined as the percussiveness of a plucked string). Cutting midrange and low midrange can also help with this, but compression can do it without changing the tone. Playing style can also make a big difference. Playing with fingers is a lot less percussive than playing with a pick. ",

            "answer_text": " The easiest way to do this and what I do is..to add an EQ and lower the 100\u2013200 hz range a bit. To make your bass sound even more professional you can make a low pass on the treble and pull it all the way back to around 400\u2013500 hz. Hope this helped. ",
