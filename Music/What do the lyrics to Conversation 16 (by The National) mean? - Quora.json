            "answer_text": "There's a great interview on AV Club where Matt Berninger explains his songwriting process:   When I\u2019m writing lyrics I\u2019m listening to the music that those guys are sending me and usually drinking wine and just sort of falling into it, sort of losing myself and just writing down thoughts. This hints to me that you shouldn't try to hard to dig a literal meaning out of The National's lyrics - they're written in broad emotional strokes. When I listen to the song, I hear a speaker who has a really deep yearning but is too afraid to pursue the person he loves because he's convinced he's unworthy. ",
