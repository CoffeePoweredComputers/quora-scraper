            "answer_text": "The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. - Bob Dylan Why i loved it? 1 powerful words My friend is very effective in literature. Listening to it instantly covers in the warmth of friendship, a feeling of familiarity, a taste of relief. It develops a level of understanding, which is supported by a sense of being accepted. Living with confusions and questions is obvious to everyone\u2019s life, therefore, search of appropriate answer is everyone\u2019s desire. The answer, in this line, addresses that desire. Seeing something blowing in the wind is fascinating. This line lured me with such fascination. 2 very abstract . What sorts of answers? Everything?? What does it mean by blowing in the wind? Since I don\u2019t see wind, but feel it, does it mean that answers are never concrete, something like wind?? I found this line to be more abstract than anything my ears have ever encountered 3 melody and voice To describe the melody and voice of Bob Dylan is something I can\u2019t dare to do. Daring so would unveil my insufficiency. ",
