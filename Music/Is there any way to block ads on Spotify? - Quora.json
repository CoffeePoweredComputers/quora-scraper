            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if this works but I\u2019ve never had any ads on Spotify. So i live in India and Spotify is not avaliable here. So i downloaded Spotify on my iPad using my Apple ID with the country changed to US. Then i downloaded a VPN service. I connected it to the US server. I opened Spotify (connected to the VPN) and created an account. After logging in i disconnected from the VPN and used Spotify without VPN. And I\u2019ve never had any ads. The only problem is that you can use Spotify outside US only for 2 weeks so you have to login using the VPN every 2 weeks. If you live in the US you can use a VPN server connected to India to listen ad free. ",
