            "answer_text": "(as a side note, I much prefer their third big hit, One, over either of these) It depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Enter Sandman is much tamer, its not thrash at all. Its more like earlier metal. Master of Puppets is a thrash song. Its not really one of Metallica\u2019s heavier songs, but its much heavier than anything off of the Black Album. Its also much more musically intricate, and has more introspective lyrics. By those criteria, i prefer Master of Puppets, but its really all up to the listener. ",
