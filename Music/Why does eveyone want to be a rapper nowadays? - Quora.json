            "answer_text": "Hey, it\u2019s a beautiful art, misused and misconstrued to mean parties, drugs, crime, guns, and thugs. It\u2019s a form of expression. What sets it apart is the way words are said out loud to a beat or a rhythm. Rapping is fun. I find great satisfaction in rapping anything, whether it\u2019s Eminem\u2019s Lose Yourself, or a freestyle, or a rap song that I wrote myself. It also seems to be a great way to up your rep in places - at school, at college, or in the neighborhood. It gains respect from the general public. When they go \u201cWhoa, this kid can spit,\u201d they start to lay off, and treat you better. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed in many places, including in my own case. It vents out emotion - pent up rage, anger, sorrow, guilt, or happiness - and gives you a sense of clarity in thinking. It sets you apart. Everybody sings and dances these days. But pull up one kid who has the potential to be the next 2pac, or the next Eminem, or the next Snoop Dogg. Yeah. It lets you play with your creativity. You could sit down and say: \u201cI like cats, I like bats, and I think I\u2019m good at raps,\u201d or you could say \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ve come back to the sinister crazy, maniac, baby, live life like this is the day we rap, maybe . . .\u201d Sorry, I trailed off freestyling over text . . . Anyway! These are, I think, some of the motives behind the youth of today wanting to rap more. And who\u2019s to stop them? It\u2019s a beautiful art - and one that should be acknowledged around the world for what it is. . . . and then there\u2019s the guys talking about how drunk they get at parties, what they have to say about women, drugs, guns, and gangs \u2014 like a certain Dwayne Michael Carter I could mention *ahem \u2014 cough cough*.

            "answer_text": "Most people now considered being a rapper so easy judging by the quality of music you hear on the radio and see on the tv. Most rappers talk about the same topics: How much money they have, the type of car they drive, how many women they have slept with, the drugs they consume, and how they will kill you if you disrespect them. These topics are so generic and unoriginal that they do not require creativity or any train of thought to write a song about. Adding to that, most record labels only care about the profit margin at the end of the year and not the message and lyricism of rappers today. As long as you can make money for the label and executives, you can get a deal and some money thrown your way. Now once the everyday person sees this, they go down the same generic path and hope to make their own niche in the rap industry. Now I am not seeing that all ambitious rappers are not creative and generic; I happen to like some of the new and rivieras ways rap is going and the messages in certain songs that can create discussion. However, the majority of people think they writing about the same things as everybody else guarantees automatic success in the hip hop genre. It's leads to over saturation and no new groundbreaking innovations in songwriting. ",
