            "answer_text": "It has to be Dark Fantasy.  I love the intro by Nicki Minaj and the almost spiritual sample from  Mike Oldfield's \"In High Places\" (btw how does Kanye find these obscure samples?) during the chorus.  I also love the beat used for the verses.  It has a sense of urgency which is hightened by Kanye's aggressive flow. A close runner up is Monster. All the rappers are on point in this song. Special mention to Rick Ross, who has a tiny intro, but his flow is impeccable (Rick Ross has to be breakout rap artist of 2010-2011).  Jay Z is also good on this track.  Nothing phenomenal, and cause it's Jay, we expect more.  Nicki is phenomenal.  I thought she was all hype until I heard this song.  Her bi-polar rap voices work to perfection here, culminating in the best lines of the song - \"Pink wig thick a** give em whip lash. I think big get cash make em blink fast\" ",

            "answer_text": "For me I would say Blame Game. It's audacious, overlong, naked, aggressively transparent. There's also a lot of compelling instrumentation and that deft aphex twin piano sample. I have a friend who initially thought that the compression was too high, but he's had this issue with post 2000 production in general. But the loudness on Blame Game is crucial. This song is best played on large speakers for reasons I'll get into now. The vocal innovation of the dueling and distorted narrators is epic on large speakers. The first time I heard it the vocals were being thrown around the room. The song became an experience.  And of course the brilliantly incoherent Chris Rock yelling over the phone for three minutes. Blame Game has a lot of interesting moving parts. ",
