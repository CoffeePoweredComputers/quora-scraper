            "answer_text": "The average trained singer has about 2\u20133 octaves of useable vocal range, and for untrained singers it's more like 1.5\u20132. Anything above 3 octaves is impressive, and 4 or more is very rare (note: USEABLE vocal range, not just any sound you can make at any pitch). A range of 7 octaves I guess is possible in theory, but it would be so unlikely it's close enough to impossible. Why would you even want a range this big, anyway? I suppose it would be impressive, but it's really hitting an ant with a cannonball. Don't worry about the size of your range too much; it's not the size that counts, it's how you use it. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "As you will know this would be almost the entire range of a grand piano. When related to a singer this would not make much sense - and maybe even less when referring to music or songs - but more like a freak record for Guinness. Yma Sumac was known for her 5 octaves (B2-C7). It may be possible to produce extreme pitches - of widely varying quality/registers and strange timbre - but quite uncoherent and hardly of any value in music except as sound effects. ",
