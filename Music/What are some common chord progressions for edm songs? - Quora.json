            "answer_text": "I would listen to a bunch of edm songs and then tell you, but telling you what some common chord progressions are doesn\u2019t really help you do what I assume you\u2019re trying to do. You should figure out the chord progressions yourself. It\u2019s easier than you think. Pause on a chord and play it over and over and over until you can sing down the chord, and then find those notes on your own keyboard, and voila. You know the chord. Do that until you\u2019ve completed the chord progression. You can do it! ",
