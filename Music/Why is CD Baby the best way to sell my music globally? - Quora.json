            "answer_text": "As a previous customer of CD Baby, I disagre. I don't like to buy anything but lossless, and Cd Baby is not offering this option anymore. Once I complained about this, at their support, and they told me to just purshase music from Tidal instead. Problem is not only that tidal is too expensive, but it can't be accessed from my country. Anyway I mostly buy from store that offers lossless, and Paypal as a payment method. I like in particular Bandcamp. Off course, most people do no care about lossless; but if I were an artist, I wouldn't choose CD Baby as the only option. ",
