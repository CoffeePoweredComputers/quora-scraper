            "answer_text": "The early rounds of auditions typically ask you to perform either as a singer or a dancer, so you should pick what you\u2019re best at. It\u2019s important to really stand out at something. That can be singing, dancing, rapping, or even (depending on agency and group) producing/writing, being attractive/eye-catching or having a funny personality for variety shows and VLive. Most idol groups are assembled to balance out each others\u2019 weaknesses, though there are occasionally vocal-oriented groups like Mamamoo or Brown-Eyed Girls where the standard is a little higher. But those groups aside, you simply need to be adequate, or at least have a good base to build on, in areas besides the one you\u2019re good at. Nobody expects a group\u2019s main dancer to be a great vocalist, or the main vocal to be the slickest dancer, or the main visual to be particularly great at anything, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on which agency you go to. For example SM Entertainment requires everything: dancing, singing, and looks. However other agencies may require you to learn some dancing in order to follow the choreography and the focus would be on the singing or rapping skills, such as Jin and Rap Monster from BTS. Overall, I think it\u2019d be best if you were good at both singing and dancing, just in case. ",
