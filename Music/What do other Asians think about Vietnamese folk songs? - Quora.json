            "answer_text": "This is not a folk song but a genre of songs known as V\u1ecdng c\u1ed5 - Wikipedia. It is a type of traditional music of the South of Vietnam. This genre was popularised by the artist Cao V\u0103n L\u1ea7u and originated in the province of B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau. The songs\u2019s name is D\u1ea1 c\u1ed5 ho\u00e0i lang - Wikipedia. It is about a woman waiting for her husband to return. This is a common theme in Vietnamese traditional music. Another very popular Southern song is Th\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u1eafm M\u00ecnh \u01a0i. I suppose for a person who is not used to tonal languages, the tonal nature of these songs may sound out of pitch or annoying, but once you are used to it, the contrasting mixture of tones is absolutely beautiful and emotional to listen to.  An interpretation by another artist, accompanied by a mix of modern and traditional dance (skip to 2:50)  \u0110\u00eam n\u1eb1m l\u1ea1i nh\u1edb m\u00ecnh \u01a1i ! M\u00ecnh \u01a1i !

English translation: Night falls and I miss you again, miss you so much. Night falls and my heart feels restless wondering if you are asleep or not. So many years in the sunny and dry fields taking care of the old mother alone. I (referring to the woman with pronoun em, can be interpreted as herself or the man talking about her) don't even have one word of complain. These songs demonstrate the patriachal nature of Vietnamese traditional society. Traditionally the woman is supposed to suffer silently, always make sacrifices, take everything thrown at her and keep the peace by withholding her emotion even when she is treated like crap. In fact a virtuous woman is supposed to endure all hardships silently and not complaining. The more a woman suffers, the more she is praised as a good woman, good mother, good wife. A woman with a sad or tragic life is romanticised, which is something I extremely hate. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. The first time I heard this melody I felt really familiar and cordial although it is really unique and really Vietnamese. But unfortunately I am not a musician so I cannot answer it as an expert does. As a Chinese, if did not see the question or did not hear the lyric, I thought it was a royal melody instead of a folk one. Although I feel really familiar with it and have searched for two days I cannot find a Chinese folk song like that. Suddenly I remembered a TV series that is familiar to both Chinese and Vietnamese: (The Legend) of Three Kingdoms (\u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49\uff0c T\u1ea5m Qu\u1ed1c Di\u1ec5n Ngh\u0129a), and I found this, which I think has some similarities with melodies in that Vietnamese folk song:  Well, I think Yayue\uff08\u96c5\u6a02\uff0c\u96c5\u4e50\uff0c\u96c5\u697d\uff0c\uc544\uc545, nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c) a kind of royal music from ancient China, has been preserved in Vietnamese, Japan, and Korea. So I think this melody may be comprehensively influenced by Yayue. Unfortunately, China, as the place where Yayue orginated, has lost it since about 500 years ago So I can just post one from Korea. Here is a Korean one:  The common feature of Yayue and sinophere folk songs may be the melody of \u201cfive notes\u201d : Gong\u5babShang\u5546Jue\u89d2Zhi\u5fb5Yu\u7fbd, which equals to Do\uff081\uff09\uff0cRe\uff082\uff09\uff0cMi\uff083\uff09\uff0cSol\uff085\uff09\uff0c\u7fbdLa\uff086\uff09 and only these five were used to compose any music. I think that Vietnamese folk song may also uses only the five notes.   Finally, my thanks to Japan, Korea and Vietnam for the preservation of Yayue\uff08\u96c5\u697d\uff0c\uc544\uc545, nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c) and I really wish my Chinese fellow musicians could restore it soon.
