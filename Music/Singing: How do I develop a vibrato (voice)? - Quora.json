            "answer_text": "I have a background in extensive vocal training as well as vocal therapy, but I am gonna go with the simple answer here. You should focus on your breathing first. (I know, cliche, but here\u2019s why:) If you create healthy habits in breathing, it becomes second nature when you go to produce sound. I am not a fan of the \u201csupport culture\u201d that emphasizes support over healthy sound production, but it is an important aspect of singing.You will be able to sing without strain longer, and be able to mess with your voice and find what works for you much easier if you have proper support techniques.So, start with an \u201cs\u201d consonant, like you are a snake. Fill your lungs, and try to feel your ribs rise. You can put your hands on the bottom rib and feel them fill and rise. Then, you should make that \u201cssssss\u201d sound like a snake. You\u2019ll feel that little muscle beneath your sternum (hard part of your chest) tighten. That\u2019s your diaphragm! Do that for a while, and move on to a \u201czzzzzz\u201d sound like a bumble bee. This will both strengthen your voice and create good habits in sound production and support.  (Notice how the back stays straight while the chest, stomach, and back expand autonomously.) Building Vibrato: The easy way would be to tell you to just start by holding a note and \u201cwaving\u201d it up and down in pitch, but I\u2019m assuming you've tried that. I would start by having someone do the \u201cSssss\u201d sound, and having them try to make it louder and softer at regular intervals. What this will do is simulate the feeling of diaphragm movement during vibrato. Then, I would have them hum a single note and do the same, ensuring that their teeth felt the buzz of the humming so as to create a resonant placement, being careful not to allow glottal stops. Next, I would have them sing a single note and try to feel that same push-pull as they did during the humming, and we would adjust from their according to their personal voice. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Taking lessons from a knowledgeable classically trained vocal coach will likely accelerate the development. I was able to develop vibrato after about 6 months of weekly lessons, and practicing exercises and singing a bit each day during my work commute. It kind of came gradually over the course of several months. At first, I found that I could do it more consistently for certain vowel sounds and only in the lowered registers. After awhile, I figured out how to consistently reproduce it for more vowel sounds and for higher registers. I\u2019ll do my best to describe what I physically feel and try to do. There is definitely a lot of physical coordination and technique yhat is comparable to developing a good golf swing or good basketball shooting stroke. Here it goes: I first make sure I\u2019ve taken a deep and expansive breath. I don\u2019t need to suck in air, but just let my gut expand like a balloon, along with the rest of my rib cage and even down below. Then, as my body has expanded, I keep my muscles and shape locked in place. As I vocalize, I\u2019m not so much pushing air out from my gut and throat, so much as a pulling feeling from the top and front of my head. But not too hard, just firm yet gentle vocalization. Again, I focus on breathing out from my throat/larynx as little as possible by try to \u201csend\u201d all of the vibrations and resonance to the front of my forehead (and really to my eyebrows by raising them). I\u2019m also at the same time raising my roof of my mouth (more commonly referred to as the soft palate) as if I have like a steaming dumpling in my mouth. Or I picture my mouth becoming a hollow cavern that extends back toward the back of my head. My voice feels like it is surfacing at my soft palate. As long as I keep a soft space in my head, then the vibrato for me feels like a ball pinging back and forth between the front of my forehead and diagonally to my soft palate. The speed of the vibrato will feel like the speed of the ball bouncing back and forth between these two areas. The harder I push, the faster the vibrato. The more relaxed I push, the slower and more pleasant the vibrato I\u2019m no professional but I\u2019m able to get a healthy vibrato this way. Hope that helps! ",
