            "answer_text": " A G note on a treble clef is shown A note is one sound being played. For example it's just a note would just be a G like I put up above.  These are some guitar chords written on a treble clef staff A chord is a 2 or more notes being played simultaneously to make a sound. You'll hear a lot of this in folk music and jazz sometimes.  This is a C major scale A scale is a set of notes being played in a sequential order. Once you've learned a scale you can reorder it and you can have a song. Scales usually have sharps and flats depending on the instrument you're playing. They're good for practice too.  An F sharp on a bass clef in the key signature A key is what scale you're using. When you play a song you'll be playing in a key. Keys are usually notes on the side of the music next to the treble or bass clef sign. Keys are also called Key signatures. Keys tell you what notes are flat sharp and natural in a song. Now the difference between all of these is that a note is the simplest of these. A note put together and played together gives you a chord. A scale is 8 different notes put together and played differently. A note is determined by the key it's in. A key is the scale you're playing without telling you the exact name of the scale. They all relate to each other. I don't know what you're looking for because these are four different things that all intertwine with one another. Mind you this is really really simplistically put because I don't know how much music theory you already know. If you have any more questions or need further explanations just add it in a comment. Thanks! :) ",

            "answer_text": "From the physics point of view, a note is a specific name of a certain sound frequency. For example the note A4 (La) is the sound at 440 Hz. Every note has a specific frequency. There are also harmonics which are positive integer multiples of the main frequency called \u201coctaves\u201d. They are the same note but from higher or lower pitch. Basically, a note is a single sound. In music theory, notes are related with \u201cintervals\u201d and there are many rules to form sets of different notes that are called \u201cscales\u201d. In western music theory, the unit of intervals is \u201ctone\u201d. For example, the interval between C (Do) and D (Re) is a \u201ctone\u201d and B (Si) to C (Do) is a \u201csemitone\u201d. Yet in eastern music theories, there are usually more intervals and \u201cmicrotones\u201d. Scales are formed with a rule of intervals originated from a selected note called \u201ckey\u201d. For example a major scale has the rule of \u201ctone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone\u201d. You can apply this rule to any selected key note and obtain a major scale on that key (i.e. A Major, F# Major). \u201cChords\u201d are simultaneously played set of (3 or more) notes which also based on a rule. You can form chords by selecting the notes of a scale with a certain pattern. So to summary; A note is a single soundChords are 3 or more notes played at the same timeScales are sets of notes with certain rulesKey is the note that the rule of a certain scale is originated",
