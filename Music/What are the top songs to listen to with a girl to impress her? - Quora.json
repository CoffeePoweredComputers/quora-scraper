            "answer_text": "There are 3 ways music can impress her, and depending on what you're going for it would affect the song choice: 1. You wanna impress her because you have similar tastes. Cool! You hope she will feel a better connection to you because of your shared taste. That's reasonable. The only thing is... We can't really help you with that. If you know her taste, then that's what you should put on. And if you don't know her taste... Well.. Ask her about it on your date and discover your shared musical tastes.. 2. You wanna impress her with you emotions/passion. Seeing a person having a lot of passion for something is very rare and thus very impressive and attractive. Put the songs that make you feel the most, and let her see it. The type of music won't matter,  3. You wanna impress her by projecting a higher status. It's been said that a man's status for women is like a woman's look for men, and you want to use music as a way to project a high status to her. Makes sense.. She did put on make up before she left the house, right? So you're allowed to plan how to project high status. There are several ways you could go about it, which kinda depends on your style, I think, and on what image you want to project. You can show a higher status by showing your sophisticated side. For example, it can be classical music (Mozart / Bach), Led Zeppelin,  Dream Theatre, or whatever you (or her) consider to be music that sophisticated people listen to.You can also show a higher status by being interesting. Showing off your knowledge in the music you're listening too can impress a girl, as long as it's really interesting and implies depth and you don't sound like  Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother and his \"fun facts\".  Essentially you can choose the songs that'll make YOU look best. Stuff you like, stuff you know about, and stuff there are interesting. Throw some passion in there too while you're at it. A few random examples:  The song \"Don't worry be happy\" by Bobby McFerrin - He didn't really kill himself like a lot of people think. He's actually a well known music professor and his passion for music in unbelievable. He's just goofing off in this song, and there are actually no instrument in it - it's just his voice. Also, watch these:      Radiohead - they wrote the song \"Karma Police\" because they had a running gag in the band whenever someone did something dickish (like eat someone's leftovers in the fridge) they would tell him that the \"Karma Police\" will get him. In the same album there's also the song \"Paranoid Android\", which is based of the robot character from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Both songs are masterpieces, and many consider OK Computer to be the best rock album in history (I've heard several music critics say \"my life is divided to 'before' OK Computer and 'after' OK Computer). AND THEY WERE JUST GOOFING OFF!!! That's how much of annoying geniuses they are. They just goof off with insider's jokes and fart the best rock album in the history of music while other people struggle to write something 'meaningful'. Robin Thicke - Blurred lines. Great song. Most people like it. The music video, however, struck a huge controversy about whether or not it's degrading to women. Of course, how he answered questions about it didn't help:   \"People say, 'Hey, do you think this is degrading to women?' I'm like, 'Of course it is. What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman. I've never gotten to do that before.'\"(Has Robin Thicke just given 2013's most dreadful interview?) What do you think? Is he allowed to make fun of this phenomenon because he's not really like that? Or did he cross a line? Have something interesting to say and you can have a great conversation with her about it, or even just tell her about the controversy if she hadn't heard about it and go from there. I can go on but you get the idea. A lot of well known songs have really interesting stories, and if you play it right they can make you look very interesting. BE CAREFUL THOUGH! If you come off as a lecturer,  a know-it-all, or just a nerd you're going to completely ruin the whole \"higher status\" thing. Be interesting, with a touch of passion. Good luck! P.S.If you can make a playlist of sophisticated songs with interesting stories that you have a great passion for and she likes too - you're getting laid for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "English songs ? You could try, though i must confess first that i haven't ever, but do try : 1. Baby you can drive my car\u2019 by \u2018The Beatles\u2019 . There are other songs i'm sure, but this one came first to my mind and i think it has merit in the possibility, that it will make the girl feel important and might soften her heart towards you. 2. Another one that just came to my mind goes like this near the end of each verse and though i am not a romantic person, the lyrics impressed me immensely : \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026there\u2019s something in the way you look tonight\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.You take my breath away\u2026\u2026\u2026the way you look tonight\u2026.. by \u2018Micheal Bolton \u2018 I think. I'm betting , this second suggestion will melt the heart of the girl in question\u2026(if any in particular) and make you a winner. Hey my minds beginning to race with new idea \u2018s, inspired no doubt by this urgent need to assist you. There's very little chance that you have heard this 50's/60's \u2026song . but i am thoroughly convinced you should give this one a go for after the job is done, to keep the relationship going for a very, very, very long time. It starts very beautifully with..\u2019 From a Jack to a King\u2026\u2026.I played an ace and I won a queen\u2026\u2026.and the song doesn't loose its Pizazz right to the very mushy end. Unfortunately I do not recall the singer's name, Maybe if you attempt some search engine tricks on \u2018You Tube\u2019 you should find that needle. Don't forget to invite me to the wedding if there\u2019s going to be one, as a reward for showing you the way. My best wishes go with my suggestions to you. ",
