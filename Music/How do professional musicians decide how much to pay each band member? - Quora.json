            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation. Big bands that make a lot of money are more likely to pay out differing amounts to each band member, based on the amount of work they do for the band or how important their position is to the band's sound. (The director/leader & the drummer will both make more than someone that just sings, etc\u2026) But the circuit in which I play is small-time gigs; We don't make enough as a band to take away from anyone to pay someone else more. I spilt the band's pay equally between us. We usually make $100 per person per gig. ",
