            "answer_text": "I prefer Paul McCartney both as a songwriter and as a singer. I happen to feel he can express emotion just as well and maybe better than John. Oh! Darling , Yesterday, Long and Winding Road Hey Jude, Let it Be and For No One spring immediately to mind. Paul also had the vocal chops to cover far more musical genres than John who in reality was rather genre versatility limited. But you know that's exactly why The Beatles had three equal frontmen each one bringing a unique vocal sound to the mix. While I prefer Paul's beautiful voice does not mean that I didn't love the others as well. They were The Beatles, there were four of them. Their names were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They made up the greatest band of all time and three of the greatest songwriters as well as the greatest songwriting team ever to have existed. They were equals all of them, the only time they weren't was when Paul or John was trying to take the piss at the other: if it weren't for me\u2026. that type of rubbish, but at the end of the day they were equals. Woe be to the unfortunate individual ( besides Yoko) who chose to speak ill of any of them around the others. They were also brothers and survived that firestorm called Beatlemania, few could have.

            "answer_text": "They were both great in their own way. Both were great 'rock'n'roll\u2019 singers, Lennon on, Rock and roll music and Everybody's got something to hide, McCartney on, Long tall Sally and, Helter skelter. McCartney was the better ballad singer (Here, there and everywhere/Michelle), and suited the more 'classical' inspired songs ( Eleanor Rigby, She's leaving home), while Lennon had a snarl in his voice that McCartney didnt ( I am the walrus, Rain). Lennon also managed to completely change his voice between the, Rubber soul, and, Revolver, albums, and while McCartney\u2019s voice evolved too it didn't change in the way Lennon's did. Both were at their peak as singers in 1966/1967 and also complimented each other's voices too, with help from George Harrison of course. A few years after the Beatles split both McCartney's and Lennon's voices became a bit 'ordinary\u2019 by their old standards and they never hit the vocal highs of the sixties again. At the end of the day McCartney was technically the better singer of the two while Lennon's voice probably had slightly more character. ",
