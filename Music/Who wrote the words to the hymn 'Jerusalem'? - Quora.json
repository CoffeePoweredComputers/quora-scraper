            "answer_text": "Well, there are several songs, all of them with at least a religious or spiritual emphasis, entitled \u201cJerusalem\u201d or with \u201cJerusalem\u201d as the first word of the title. Only some of them have ever been called \u201chymns.\u201d However, I suspect you mean the classic that goes: And did those feet in ancient time,Walk upon England's mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of God,On England's pleasant pastures seen? And did the Countenance Divine,Shine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded here,Among these dark Satanic Mills? If this is the one you mean, the words are a poem by William Blake (1757\u20131827), written as a preface to his epic Milton: A Poem in Two Books (1808). The music is by Sir Hubert Parry (1848\u20131918). If that\u2019s not the one you mean, there are plenty of others. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Google it was William Blake. I assume you are talking about the one that is loved in England. It was a poem written in 1804. Music was added later around 1906 by Hubert Perry. I have never listened to the song, but from what I read online it is based on a siupposed visit of Jesus as a young child to England. He was supposedly accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea who was the rich believer who gave Jesus his new unused tomb for his burial. The poem is based on a legend. Nevertheless, it is a much beloved hymn in England. ",
