            "answer_text": "I know a lot of people who would ask the same question, but that happens after I recommend to them some really good metal bands and they don\u2019t seem to understand why I like metal myself. Firstly, metal is an acquired taste. Most people don\u2019t listen to it for the first time in their life and go \u2018Hey this is great!\u2019 A lot of metalheads (me included) start out with listening to less heavy styles of music; one of them is rock. Others may start out with classical music (a lot of classical musicians are known to like metal). Even dubstep listeners start to like metal after they listen to some of it. Now these metalheads-in-the-making wouldn\u2019t really like the music when they first listen to it. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not alone when I say it\u2019s hard to get accustomed to the sound of metal at least. But after your ears adapt to the sound, oh man. So many other styles are now open for you to explore. The metal genre is sooooo huge. Calling it a subgenre of rock would be like calling physics a sub-field of math. Sure, you can use equations to simplify physics, but as of right now, both physicists and mathematicians are doing their own, distantly related things. What I\u2019m going for is, either your ears haven\u2019t gotten accustomed to the sound of metal, or you haven\u2019t started out with metal in the recommended manner (which is, according to me, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and any other \u2018old\u2019 metal band, then Iron Maiden, then the big four) This order can change from person to person, though. Or there\u2019s a third possibility that you really can\u2019t tolerate metal, which is fine. I know lots of people who listen to all kinds of music but are perfectly fine with not listening to metal music. They have their own tastes and are fine with it. But it\u2019s still good to at least try out good metal music. If everything else fails, there\u2019s always lighter forms of metal (look them up). Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll start to love metal after some time? ",

            "answer_text": "metal is a sub-genre of rock..so the basics of music is the same in both\u2026there can be many reasons for a rock lover to not like metal1. EXTREMENESS-metal sub genres like death metal and black metal take lyrical freedom to extremeness..and rock sure have heavy and worth thinking topics and lyrics and ideas that are not stupid\u2026but there are many and so many love songs that sure are good but not as an eye opener topic as dictatorship or politics\u2026and many sub genres of metal use extreme growling and screaming vocals that are hard to understand.2.COMPLEX COMPOSITION-In metal the composition is way beyond the simpleness of pop ..and also more complex than rock...masters of metal music are generally masters of the instrument the pick up\u2026they are the ultimate\u2026but that, at the same time, means that it is expected to entertain musically educated crowd and a crowd that appericiates skills\u2026U cant expect a pop music fan to like metal because the music they listen to demands no musical knowledge and is easy to digest..it doesn\u2019t make u think\u2026whereas metal sure does make u think..and rock well not as much3.CULTURE-the metal community around the world have developed a culture of dressing and thinking that is different than the norms of the other music fans\u2026that depends on the person for sure\u2026and the metal crowd norms in a concert are in many ways different than rock ",
