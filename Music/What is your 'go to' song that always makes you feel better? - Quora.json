            "answer_text": "\u201cGet it Right\u201d by Rachel Berry (portrayed by Lea Michelle) in Glee. This song is sung by Rachel in Glee, who was in a phase where she found herself only capable of messing things up and causing damage to her and everyone around. The lyrics reflects that although she has tried numerous times and still can\u2019t get it right, she realized that she needs to let go of the restriction by what people have been saying around. It\u2019s much actually more deeper than not being sad, it always helps acknowledge me that albeit everyone is different and we all have different vulnerabilities or weaknesses, it does not mean that these stuffs can constrain you. What have I done? I wish I could run away from this ship goin' under Just tryin' to help, hurt everyone else Now I feel the weight of the world is on my shoulders What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? 'Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh, how many times will it take for me to get it right? To get it right Can I start again? With my faith shaken, 'cause I can't go back and undo this I just have to stay and face my mistakes But if I get stronger and wiser, I'll get through this What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? 'Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh, how many times will it take for me to get it right? So I throw up my fist, throw a punch in the air And accept the truth that sometimes life isn't fair I'll send out a wish and I'll send up a prayer And finally someone will see how much I care What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? Oh, my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh, how many times will it take to get it right? To get it right ",

But the song that always, always, ALWAYS makes me feel better is Every Day is Halloween by Ministry. If I\u2019m scraping the bottom of the barrel for something to remind me that I\u2019m a worthwhile human, this song reminds me that I\u2019m awesome purely for the fact that I\u2019m a unique human, even if I\u2019m not at the level of Al Jourgensen. And it has an awesome baseline. ",
