            "answer_text": "Well, there are only an elect few who could beat Jotaro in a fight. These people could include: Diavolo  Stand: King Crimson Abilities: Can erase time which only Diavolo can move in. Can also see into the future. Ultimate Kars  Stand: None Abilities: Immortal, Ultimate Lifeform (no weaknesses) Rohan Kishibe  Stand: Heaven\u2019s Door Abilities: Rewriting any aspect of one\u2019s life Giorno Giovanna (GER)  Stand: Golden Experience Requiem Abilities: Negate any damage, a bunch of other OP stuff we don\u2019t know about yet Enrico Pucci (MIH)  Stand: Made In Heaven Abilities: Time Acceleration, Universe Restart, Etc. Johnny Joestar (Tusk Act 4)  Stand: Tusk Act 4 Abilities: Infinite Rotation/Power Funny Valentine  Stand: D4C Love Train Abilities: Hop between Dimensions, Misfortune Redirection I think all of these people have an above average shot against Jotaro and some would win easily.

            "answer_text": "Random dude with poison. Let's just ignore the stands part, who know what extra power Star Platinum will conveniently develope if Jotaro allows it (evil spirit can move far but it's haunting me so it will return=> battle is close combat stuffs so it can only stay close=> Dio can stop time and they keep saying that we have the same stand so\u2026.). And I suck at power scaling so no compare. Gun is useless in Jojo but human kind is delicate and die easily. ",
