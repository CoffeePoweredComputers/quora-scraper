            "answer_text": "I get uncontrollable anger with Xanax, or any benzo for that matter. It\u2019s odd. I\u2019ll try to explain\u2026..I get my prescription or Xanax (1mg) 60 pills, so one twice daily. The first day I get my prescription I take 1, 1mg or even .5 is way too much I guess because my body has a crazy reaction to it. I then later on forget that I have taken it due to taking the pill I had just taken not even a hour ago. Take another. Another. And then I\u2019m in black out mode. Once I take that first one it\u2019s game over. I don\u2019t intended on doing that. But every time it happens. Once blackout mode is on affect I start taking 6\u201310 at a time, what I\u2019m told by my wife and family members. And by then I\u2019m a rude inconsiderate mean person that is so violent that I do anything and everything I can. I don\u2019t know what the anger comes from. It just happens. And it gets worse every dose. And yes I started off taking it by abusing it. But then I stopped well tried stopping. This time, I\u2019d say the 25th of October I\u2019ve been in blackout mode from then till probably the 3rd of November. I broke my mother\u2019s glass storm door, was supposedly violent with another doctor of mine to the point they thought I was going to seriously hurt them and they thought I was on heroin. So hey gave me Narcan and called the police. It took 6 cops according to them to take me down and get me into custody. I wrecked my rental car \u201con purpose\u201d I was told. It\u2019s just instant explosive anger that I don\u2019t and truly mean I don\u2019t remember. Legit blackout mode. I was supposedly in he hospital. Police called 4 times. I supposedly walked across the broken glass from the storm door and intentionally cut my feet. And they were cut bad. But I know I sound stupid and to most of you. Probably all of you ask \u201cwhy the hell do you still take it.\u201d I don\u2019t know. But it gets worse every time. Just stay away from it. It\u2019s no good weather you need it or not ",

            "answer_text": "Xanax makes someone so incredibly relaxed that their inhibitions and internal censors - those things in our heads that keep us from doing and saying inappropriate things - they all pretty much shut down. Here is what Cambridge Univ. says about it - - - \"In the majority of recipients, benzodiazepines (like Xanax) have a calming effect but in a minority they can cause paradoxical reactions (also called disinhibitory reactions) characterised by acute excitement and an altered mental state: increased anxiety, vivid dreams, hyperactivity, sexual disinhibition, hostility and rage.\" You could probably add Kleptomania to that list, in my opinion.
