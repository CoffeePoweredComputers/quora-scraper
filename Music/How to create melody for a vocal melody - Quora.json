            "answer_text": "A lot of people just sing the chords, they just write down some words and recite them using the roots/fifths of the chords they\u2019re singing over. For me, in a perfect world, I start with the hook of the song. This will usually be a short phrase or a word. I experiment with different rhythms for saying that phrase or word. Then I write those rhythms down and experiment with different notes until I find something I like. I look at what I\u2019m trying to say in the song and try to figure out how much \u201cmaterial\u201d I have, if there are ways I can take the same vocal hook and get it to mean different things in different contexts. From that, I figure out the song form I want to use: AABA, VC, or Blues. And from that, I decide where I want the hook to fall. For example, I could have the hook at the start and or end of each A section or Chorus, etc. And then, using the hook motif, I build the melody, trying to make that hook the most impactful part of the song. Then I write the lyrics to that melody. The world, however, is not perfect. Sometimes, I\u2019ll write the entire lyric before I have a note. Sometimes, I\u2019ll come up with a groove first and I might have to use nonsense words until I figure out what I want to say. I might get an idea of what I want to say first, and then find that I already have some music that fits it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well everything starts with a melody as no song is produced without a melody. Who ever is the Songwriter rather it's the Artist, Producer or another writer created the melody before any lyrics are written. I'm a Songwriter myself on the Composer side as I'm the guy that would create the musical track, that works out the chords and melody, program and compose an entire arrangment with midi sequencing. Since I layed down the foundation a singer would follow the melody i created or they continue on what I created by singing. When working with the Vocalist in the studio as a Producer, the Artist and I would bounce idea's back and forth and would create the vocal stack In a 3 or 4 part harmony. I direct and coach the Artist during the recording process to help capture the best recorded performances and pick the best takes. I make sure the Artist is singing in the right key that corresponds to the chords that's playing and make sure they are delivering the right energy. I analayize each section of the song to make sure every instrument talks to each other and not stepping on toes. The vocalist is also an instrument themselfs. ",

Start by learning an instrument - that will require you to learn some music theory, and that knowledge will help you write melodies. ",
