You should now see the Play Store that matches the country in your legal address.If these steps don't resolve your issue, you can also try purchasing a paid app and refunding it within the 2-hour return window in place of Step 4 above; however, returns like this can only be done in the Play Store app at this time.

So it seems even if you are in Canada, you seem to be using an active and roaming Indian SIM card, as per the question description. Rooting your device, obviously enables you to temporarily/permanently tamper with the country of your device irrespective of the SIM, as mentioned in some of the other answers. Edited on 15/06/15:It seems this method is not how it works now as of Android 5.1.1. The country is determined by the address registered with the primary credit card added to your Google Wallet/Play store account. ",
