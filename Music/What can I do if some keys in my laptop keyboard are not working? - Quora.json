            "answer_text": "Some of the keys on my laptop keyboard are not working. How can I fix that? One of the inherent flaws of keyboard design is that small particles of whatever fall between the keys and affect the performance of the keyboard. I bought a small air compressor just for the purposes of cleaning out my computers and things like keyboards. First, turn the keyboard off and flip it upside down and shake it. Maybe tap it a few times on your desk. That will get a lot of the debris out but if that doesn't do it, try some air pressure. You don't have to get a compressor like I did. They sell cans of compressed air in office supply stores and computer centers. Another thing you can try is to apply some lubricant that is designed for electronic parts. An example of that is CRC 2-26 5 oz. Multi-Purpose Lubricant-02004 - The Home Depot. Make sure you do the first part first and that is cleaning out most of the debris through shaking and compressed air before you apply lubricant. Short of that, it's time for a new keyboard. I've gone through so many keyboards. It seems that is the weakest link of all in a computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Its pretty obvious that you should get your laptop fixed which would take a hefty amount of money but since you have asked here that means you need some kind of cheap hack, Don\u2019t worry I got your back (or in this case your pocket :p ). HACK #1 : simply buy an external cheap wired keyboard and disable the keyboard which is in your laptop, u can do this by uninstalling the inbuilt keyboard drivers. HACK #2 : If there are 2\u20133 keys which are faulty in your laptop then you can remap them in other keys which you don\u2019t use very often, as suggested by other answers also. For windows user : you can download hot key app( https://autohotkey.com/download/ ) and now just open note pad enter any kind of mapping in this format :- keycode :: keycode (without any space) example: if you want to map left alt with -> a write this in notepad LAlt::a and save the notepad file with .ahk extension now run this file as administrator and ..Voila !! ps : for more key codes you can refer to http://hotkey.com there you will get keycode list.
