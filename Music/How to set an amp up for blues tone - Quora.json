            "answer_text": "There is a thousand approaches that you can use on your guitar and amplifiers to play the blues, but to your question, when an amp is involved, its the electric blues we're talking about. The question can be answered by following what all those blues legend did. The set up of an amp one of those essential parts for you to get a blues tone, but I do think the amp itself is more important. You'll need a good tube amp to start with, a Fender Twin, a  Fender Bassman, a VOX AC30, all historical brands and models with very notable users. For example SRV used a Fender Twin, Jimmy Page used a VC30, knowing that is very important in helping us to get the blues tone, we would then know who to learn from and how did they master their instruments (including the amps, obviously).  With a good tube amp on hand, its already 50% of the work done. Turn the volume up, to get the tubes and tweeters really working. The natural \"overdrive\" is always the sweetest. If the environment doesn't allow you to get that loud, you should consider getting a drive pedal that would work well with the amp, to give you one more \"dirty\" option other than the clean sound.  Row down the bass on your EQs (generally speaking), when playing loud, the overwhelming bass frequencies might muddy up your tone and it won't sound good with the band playing together. And for mids and highs, I think its more of a personal preferences thing. Use your ears, if the guitar the pick up, especially the bridge pick up, sounded too harsh to you, definitely row down the treble to get a smoother sound. Last but not least, this saying might be old but its old and still can be heard everywhere with a reason, \"tone is in the fingers\". If we don't have a story to tell, it doesn't matter even if we have the best quality of paper and pen. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Although a great \"blues\" tone is claimed for a certain guitar or amp, there really isn't a specific one. Listen to 10 blues guitarists and you'll hear 10 different tones. The main thing is to be able to express emotion with the guitar  - most of this comes from the fingers, string bending and picking style. Being able play both softly and loudly within the same song, and using the natural expressiveness that guitar is capable of is the key. To do this, your amp and guitar should be set up to allow for very clean tone to moderate distortion with sustain to crate soulful notes. Some amps will do this naturally or an overdrive pedal can be used. The choice of overdrive pedals is endless and one can spend a lifetime looking for the \"perfect\" one. If you are just starting out just about any OD pedal will do, when you get more proficient you can try different ones, but keep in mind that it is more in the fingers than it is the equipment. Heavy distortion (metal and hard rock) should be avoided and electronic modulation (delay, chorus, flange, etc.) should be kept to a minimum or used selectively to ensure the natural expression of the guitar strings is not obscured. This takes experimentation with different techniques and practice. Listen to very expressive players and try to reproduce their tone and phrasing. ",
