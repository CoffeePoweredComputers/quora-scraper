            "answer_text": "OK that is an in-ya-face question, but the speculations still exist. First of all, let\u2019s define GOOD bass player, so that we could label them as BETTER or WORSE. Like in any creative artistic job, being a bass player is no dfferent from being a guitar player for example. In the artworld, there are NO measurement tools that can measure the brightness or coolness or overall betterness of an artist. As an artist myself, I\u2019ll tell you a little secret. Artists create first, and their fans have nothing to do with this. Artists create, from the neuroscientific and psychological etc point of view, either because \u201cthey cannot not play\u201d, \u201chave a very deep true passion for creation\u201d, \u201cbecause they have this \u2018butterflies-in-stomach\u2019 feeling all the time, anxiety-type feeling, and to speak in basic terms, artists write books, paint, play, sing, rap, drum, draw, whatever the medium is - when they have that something inside of them that is actually burdening, to get rid of this or share this, this can be positive experience, and also negative. So we can take a theoretical bass player, who can play bass, and assess him or her in many different ways: the technique, the speed, the accuracy, improvisational skills, innovating something in their playing, also, that is quite important too, I think that BY DEFAULT bassists or guitarists or whoever MUST be able to slide into an absolutely unknown music that is being played in a room, and step in as soon as possible, and step in productively=augmenting the quality of the output of the whole band. The circumstances of how Jason Newsted appeared in the band were, in short, he was the first guy to come over when they decided finally after some time to look for another bassist, because Cliff Burton, the bass/distorted bass virtuoso, was killed in Sweden during their tour, each of the band members had a bus to travel in and settle in for the european leg of their tour. The bus (originally Kirk Hammet was supposed to spend a night on the road sleeping in this murderous bus, but they were fooling around and decided to swap, so the did. There was a horrible car crash in the middle of the night \u2014driver fell asleep and crushed into something, Cliff died, the driver survived for that time. Cliff Burton died on Hetfield\u2019s hands. There knew each other very well, they were like brothers, they adored him because he was always \u2018trippin\u2019 and cracked sokes all the time, he was a big-hearted person with a really big talent. Now imagine how Kirk Hammet felt, - \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d hit him more than any other member of the band, because he was supposed to be in that bus, but somehow Burton ended up there. This was a dreadful time, they almost disbanded, because all four members were essential for making their signature music and sound, they wrote songs mostly altogether. Hetfield felt a an anger/grief/helplessness, but some time passed, and they decided to go on. Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam And Jetsam, was one of the first to hear the terrible news about his favorite band. He knew what he was getting into: no matter who\u2019d come to play bass, they all saw someone trying to substitute Cliff. For the first months, Newsted was given a silent treatment, or hear other guys talking shit behind his back. So when it came to recording \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, their way of doing things was different. If you listen to \u201cJustice\u201d, you will hear that everywhere possible, they brought his bass on the background. And compare it to bass presence in Orion for example. Then they went on tour, Newsted showed himself as a bass player that fits the band almost perfectly, time passed, and he was already getting away from this \u2018shy playing\u2019, going bass solos during the shows. But his status was never equal to the previous bass player. So his playing was of course the best he could do to prove something to the rest of the band, a musician will hear it. Then he left mysteriously, but officially with \u201cno hard feelings\u201d. Rob of Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves, playing with Ozzy Osbourne, was proposed to Metallica by Ozzy himself, just like he sent Mike Inez to Alice In Chains that was left without a bass player who OD\u2019ed. Rob is a 5 strings bass virtuoso, more into funky grooves and basslines rather than metal shredding in low frequencies. But he adapted really quickly with no problems. But he had to learn many Metallica songs unlike Newsted who knew them all right after they\u2019d release an album. Newsted\u2019s 4 strings bass manner of playing is very straightforward, I\u2019d say. Rob is very experienced bass player, he\u2019s older than Jason, but I think they both have a niche, just listen to Newsted\u2019s solo album, and hear Trujillo playing with Ozzy or with Suicidal Tendencies - they are simply different, for the albums Metallica recorded with Jason, Jason fit. When Rob Trujillo took his place, Metallica\u2019s sound was already not the one they had ten years before him, because they were growing as individuals and as a band, it was another era for them. Right now Rob, to my mind, is too good for Metallica, he\u2019s a very versatile genre-wise, he can play anything with anyone he wants, and the bass player for such a cliche band like Metallica I think was totally OK with Jason Newsted, who left for reasons still unknown. So for Metallica Newsted is better, but for Rob Trujillo Metallica is very narrow. Regardless of the band, if we take the two bassists, Rob is a winner of course, but if we consider the band, both are good for them. Especially Rob. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, he is a better bass player, but the better fit for Metallica is a matter of taste. Rob is probably more of a classical/ traditional bass player. He's probably closer to Cliff Burton than is Jason. He doesn't use a pick and can play probably any genre of bass very fluently. He's very talented and can even play Spanish-style flamenco guitar very well. Musically, he's pretty knowledgeable. By any measure, he's a bass virtuoso, and can handle the speed and precision that Metallica requires with ease. The contribution he made on ManUnKind, to my ears, is more intricate than anything I ever heard Jason write or play. Jason, on the other hand, uses a pick. He's a very competent bassist and has a cool vibe and stage presence. He was there with Metallica through the hardest times(immediately after Cliff's death) and through Metallica's meteoric rise. Jason really became the soul of Metallica from 1987\u20132000 in my opinion. While, Het and Ulrich seemed to have immersed themselves more in the business and commercial success of the band, Jason never really changed. Every night on stage, he brought it with the same passion and fury he did when he first joined the band. Jason is also a fairly good back up singer. Of the two bassists, I prefer Newsted for sentimental reasons. Not that you can go wrong with Trujillo, but Jason was there in Metallica's prime. He was there when Metallica stepped onto the world stage and crushed everything in their path. Rob has been with Metallica longer than any bassist, which is astounding, but yet he has the least contribution thanks to the group releasing only a pair of decent albums since 2003. If Rob should ever decide to hang it up, I would love to see Jason return to the group. ",
