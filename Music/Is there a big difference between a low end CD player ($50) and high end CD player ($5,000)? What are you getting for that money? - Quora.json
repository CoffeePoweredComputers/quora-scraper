            "answer_text": "A high end CD player is more likely to support play of SACDs, which are encoded at 24 bits per sample, 44.1K samples/second, rather than the normal 16 bits/44.1K. As a famous experiment reported in the journal of the Boston Audio Society proved, human hearing cannot distinguish between the same source material played at 24 bits versus 16 bits per sample. However, the 24 bit recordings definitely sounded better. Why? Because they were mastered with more care, for connoisseurs who were willing to pay more for a better sounding CD. So that\u2019s something you might get for your money, but only if you buy SACDs. The other quality difference between the low and high end players is likely in the D/A (digital-to-audio) converter circuitry used, as the name implies, to convert the bits on the CD to audio signals at the output jacks. For example, the Kalista DreamPlay One ($43,000 US) is said to use the Asahi Kasei AK4497EQ premium audio DAC. That chip can handle 32-bit samples at 384K samples/second\u2026but that really doesn\u2019t make it any better at the CD 16 bit sample size and 44.1K/sec data rate. High end players often provide XLR connectors for balanced analog outputs, but unless your listening room has absurd amounts of electrical noise, you won\u2019t hear a cleaner signal than you will with a well-shielded unbalanced cable, and you\u2019re faced with the need to plug the other end of the cable into some other component that has balanced inputs. Of course that doesn\u2019t justify several thousand dollars of price increase, but we\u2019re talking about customers who will spend several hundred dollars on a power cord. A fool and his money, as they say. It\u2019s akin to driving a Bugatti Veyron in downtown Boston. Looks really, really nice, but its performance is wasted. A high end CD player will likely offer other convenience features. Some can play MP3 files from a USB flash drive. The DreamPlay One offers TOSLink so your other compatible components can control it. (So does a low-end Samsung Blu-Ray player.) It also provides AES/EBU digital audio outputs - that simply passes the A/D job to some other box. CDs and their players include error correcting codes and circuitry, so none of them is more accurate in the digital domain than any other. Either you get good data or you get skipping, and even low end players don\u2019t skip these days. TL;DR A high end CD player will include a moderately better D/A converter circuit than a low end CD player. You\u2019ll pay the extra money for snob appeal, marketing hype and gorgeous mechanical design. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an audio DSP engineer. I don\u2019t do analog design so I don\u2019t know everything about audio gear, but I know more than the average Joe. The areas where you are going to see actual gains are in good D/A convertors, a good amplifier circuit, and a better clock/less jitter. But here\u2019s the thing, these can be solved well in products that are quite affordable. And if you are using the digital out (say using SP/DIF to your receiver) then the CD player\u2019s D/A convertors and amp are irrelevant. All the CD has to do for a digital connection is read the bits off the CD and supply them to the digital out in a well-controlled, timely manner. You don\u2019t need to spend $5k to accomplish this. Your typical Sony (or other name brand) CD player can do this just fine as can be verified by an audio precision machine, a double-blind listening test, or any number of other scientifically-rigorous approaches. As alluded to by other answers, there are longevity and aesthetic benefits to certain players, but the audio quality quickly plateaus only to be further refined by pixie dust. I wouldn\u2019t spend more than $200 on a CD component player\u2026 and in fact I just use my PS3 though the disc noise is a definite drawback. So actually I use ripped CDs as files off of my network\u2026 same bits without the mechanical noise. A dedicated Yamaha (or other name brand) CD player in the $50 to $200 range would be just fine for a digital connection. You may want to spend more than $50 if you\u2019ll be using the analog outputs or a headphone out and really care about audio quality. (If you are driving high-quality large element headphones then consider a good headphone amp or pick your CD player based on the quality of its headphone amplification). Beware of sales pitches with ill-defined terms. You want low jitter. And for analog outs you want clean (low THDN, low crosstalk) output with a flat response. A super-expensive CD player doesn\u2019t magically improve the imaging on the CD, etc. It is relatively easy to create 2 faithful, high-fidelity signals. Take the money you might have spent on a super-expensive CD player and put into your amps or speakers, or room treatment. Or put it in the bank and get interest. Enjoy. ",
