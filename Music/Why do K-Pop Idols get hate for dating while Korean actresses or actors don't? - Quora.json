            "answer_text": "From a lot of the dating cases I\u2019ve seen, the hate is really just because of selfish, obsessive, delusional, saseang fans. I remember one time Taeyeon from SNSD started to date Baekhyun from EXO. EXO fans went ballistic and attacked Taeyeon for a really, really long time. One time she allegedly attended an EXO concert to support Baekhyun (there wasn\u2019t any evidence to support this) and EXO fans started to attack her on Instagram. They would comment, \u201cWhy come?\u201d and even called her a bitch. These delusional fans feel like they have an intimate connection with their beloved idol and feel threatened when they find out that their bias actually has a romantic life that doesn\u2019t involve them. To be fair, this was one of the most extreme cases of hate I\u2019ve seen. Not only that, but K-pop groups tend to have way larger fanbases than individual actors/actresses. The larger the fanbase, the larger the amount of hate you\u2019ll get. I think this is one huge factor to how accepted relationships are when it comes to actors. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is quite simple actually.  Idols are marketed as fandoms' lovers and boyfriends/girlfriends. Actors are not.  As much as u may like someone, if they do not claim they love u or give u any hope they will be yours, u won't become jealous or angry when they start dating. A bit sad, sure, but not deeply or really sad.  Also, most Kdrama actors literally have to act like they already love someone almost all the time; fans will be used to seeing them having awesome chemistry with other actors; already occupied.  Idols, however, literally build their fanbase over claiming to \"love\" their fans. This gives their fans a false sense of attachment and hope that they can actually date them. Sure, some idols act too, but because of their status as idols, they do not act as frequently as normal actors and fans will already have developed that sense of love for them. Therefore they blow up and cancel an idol if they start dating because of their feeling of \"betrayal\". ",
