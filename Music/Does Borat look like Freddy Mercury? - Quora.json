            "answer_text": "\u201cBorat\u201d certainly looks more like Freddie than Rami and would have been a pretty obvious choice as far as looking similar enough to portray him (with studio enhancements and as long as all the other actors and extras wore big heels throughout the movie) but I\u2019m so glad Rami got the part. The fact that you used \u201cBorat\u201d instead of Sacha Baron Cohen says it all. His acting experience is limited pretty much to parodies and this could make him questionable for handling a serious part. Since he wanted the film to be a version more centered around Freddie\u2019s sex life and parties and most of his roles have a mocking tone I wouldn\u2019t necessarily trust him to play Freddie truthfully or with empathy. Rami is a fan of Freddie\u2019s and I\u2019m grateful to him for portraying Freddie with such feeling and empathy. It went a long ways to making up for the many ways in which Freddie was mischaracterized by the script which was about 80% of the movie. ",
