            "answer_text": "I wanted to do this, because there is this general consensus that J-Hope is a great dancer and a funny person. However, they fail to see the in-between. In addition, I don't see many posts about him here either. \ud83d\ude1f So please let me indulge here and state why I love Jung Hoseok/J-Hope/Hobi.  \u2600\ufe0f \ud83c\udf3b Jung Hoseok \ud83c\udf3b \u2600\ufe0f = my hope \ud83d\udc9d, my angel \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb Where do I start? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1c There are so many reasons why I love this man. First off, Hobi has the best personality and sense of character. He's the type who likes to bring laughter and joy for others, oftentimes at his OWN expense.  If he's close with you, he likes to tease and have playful banter, but never to wound or cut deeply. Additionally, he is the type who does not like to highlight himself (unless of course to bring out comedy as before-mentioned). He's the main dancer and choreography leader, but I never hear him say he's the best among the members. In fact, he is rarely at the center! \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude2d   Whenever BTS is asked to show the key points of their dance, Hobi almost always asks Jimin or sometimes Jungkook to demonstrate. Sometimes, I wish that he would go beast mode and dance his heart out.  At least he got to do his \"Boy Meets Evil\" dance at the 2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards!  Secondly, Hobi is a true friend. Just watch how he always treats the other members. You will always see him clapping for them and praising them. For example: \u3030 Seokjin \u3030 Hobi always praises Jin's handsomeness and sexiness. And if you notice, J-Hope always chooses to sing Jin's parts. Ex: When rappers and vocals switch parts; Jin's part in 'B,S&T'; and Jin's solo 'Awake'. In addition, their relationship is best observed in 'American Hustle Life'. According to Jin, it is Hobi's big heart and friendship that allowed him to grow in dance. Also, Jin was challenged to do well in rap. Their teamwork propelled them to do well in acting, beatboxing, etc.  \u3030 Yoongi \u3030 Hobi always try to engage Suga's participation. Suga has been doing well lately, but for previous BTS promotions, I notice Hobi coaxing a reaction from Suga. In fact, Suga will do just about anything for Hobi. Case in point: Suga danced to Beyonce's song!!! \ud83d\ude31  \u3030 Namjoon \u3030 I think Hobi is the other half to Moni. Moni has stated that Hobi is water to his fire. Hobi likes to correct Moni's bad habits. That's why I think that Hobi is essential when it comes to Moni's leadership. Moni knows what is the best for the members, and Hobi tries to wrangle the members' cooperation. Ex: Watch the ''WINGS' Album Pre-Show' when Moni was the MC.  Jimin \u3030 Hobi treats him like the younger brother he never had. He dotes on him, and builds him up. And, I think, he tries to mold him as a dancer. And because Jimin only wants to show manliness and maturity, Hobi always try to bring out the silliness from Jimin. \"I can never be a manly man because of you hyung!\" And also, Hobi worries over Jimin's weight. He is always the first to tell Jimin that he's getting too skinny. Ex: Hobi always pinches Jimin's cheeks and chin to feel the excess skin.  \u3030 Taehyung \u3030 I've always noticed that Hobi handles V's uniqueness the best. Sometimes the other hyungs make fun of the way he talks and acts, but Hobi goes along with him and gives encouragement. Hobi is V's aeqyo and sunshine buddy. They get each other's personality and traits. I think Hobi is the only hyung that can play with him.  Jungkook \u3030 I kind of feel like Hobi is the hyung that JK looks up to. Like Suga during the previous BTS promotions, Hobi tries to bring out JK from his shell. Also, during trainee days, Hobi was the proverbial shoulder that he cried on. Suga stated that Hobi was JK's mother.  I personally think that Hobi is one of the best dancers that I have ever seen. In my opinion, he may be the best dancer in the whole K-Pop scene. He has the 'skills that kills'. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude43 He was an underground dancer in Gwanju and won many awards. Although BTS' choreography is NO joke, I hate to say it, but it masks J-Hope's true dancing skills. \ud83d\ude33 Watching his dancing videos, AHL parts and practice videos, you can see his talent and passion for dance. However, it was the 'Boy Meets Evil' comeback trailer that proved to me that we haven't seen the rest of his abilities. He just keeps surprising me! \ud83d\ude0d  He\u2019s an incredible rapper. New A.R.M.Ys are probably only aware of Rap Monster and Suga because they have more parts or verses in BTS songs. However, it saddens me when J-Hope's contributions are overlooked. He is part of the creative process in producing, composing and writing their songs. For me, after listening to J-Hope's '1 Verse', it proves to me that he can hang with Moni and Suga, and that he is not just an idol rapper. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb   Anyways, I can talk about BTS and J-Hope forever, but this is getting too long. \ud83d\ude01 I noticed that Hobi wasn't getting much love so I decided to do this. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a That being said, I love BTS and this fandom. Thank you for your patience and understanding in reading this! Have a hopeful day! \ud83e\udd17 ",

He always puts others over himself. He's kind, emphatic, intelligent, talented, patient and overall a wonderful human being who deserves nothing but love and support. I know a lot of people think his personality is fake, and that might be true. But even that is a part of his charm. He has manged to create this perfect sunshine facade in front of the Camera that he has kept up all these years without failing and still does. He does it for the sake of the fans and the other members. He always hypes others up and supports them. He is overall just a wonderful man. And here's a bonus - chicken noodle soup - my fav ever hobi bop  ",
