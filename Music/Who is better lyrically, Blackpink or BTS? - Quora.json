            "answer_text": "Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm This question seems to start off in some edge.. Anyways, the question was who is better lyrically Blackpink or BTS right? To start off \u201cwho is better lyrically\u201d, that question makes me think something.. perhaps the question is\u2026 Idk a bit subjective?  I'm saying that because I don't think there's any scientific evidence that suggests that one is better than the other but again idk.. But to be honest here I think what the person who asked the question probably wanted to know which one had the most meaningful lyrics. In that case I guess based off the answer section and most people on quora most people find BTS music to be more deep and relatable Hey I'm not gonna lie I really agree with that..as an armyblink I really have to say that BTS meanings are really on a another level, I personally don't think any other group has had such sensitivity and a positive message behind their lyrics.. but as the question states it asked which one is better lyrically.. U know what that changes a lot of things cuz now I'm considering other stuff that might make the lyrics to a song good like how catchy it is, how it matches with the mood of the song, how much it wants you to sing with it, etc. See everyone in the section keeps on stating the same thing (*insert a screenshot of some lyrics to the song and defend or explain the meaning behind it) But there's a problem when using this type of evidence to make ur point..cuz ur comparing two different groups with TOTALLY different types of music genres. Blackpink definitely has a more hip-hop, electronic type of genre with fast and upbeat songs that really hype up the listner  While BTS on the other hand have a wide range of genres which make their type of music more approachable for a lot of people  Which is y their lyrics take different roads and if u ask y then let me explain.. see if ur a producer and u created a song like \u201cboombayah\u201d how would u create the lyrics for that song? I don't think it would be an easy task for u to add lyrics that would be meaningful and touching like \u201cbutterfly\u201d from bts.  I mean imagine boombayah being sung to lyrics like these \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Or try the other way around, butterfly soundtrack to boombayah lyrics  Ya see my point? Blackpink lyrics are meant for BPs music while BTS lyrics are meant for BTS's type of music It's as easy as that, both bring u into different types of moods and feels They serve a different purpose And to y'all who constantly are stating that BTS lyrics are farrr better then Blackpink and are unable to accept the greatness in both then maybe ur missing out on a totally different type of music with its own quirks.. But honestly I would jam to both\u2026 \u2026.. So Stan blacktan \ud83d\udc9c\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c\u2665\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering to your question, i'm just curious to know the reason why you are comparing a group with 200+ songs in their hand and a group with only 14 songs in their hand! Now, let's compare the lyrics of some of their songs and let's see if their lyrics have got a meaning in the song or not.  BTS  What is you that you dreamed of? Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say Go your own way Even if you live a day Do something Put weakness away Their songs talk about young generations. For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt About toxic love. They point fingers at me But I don\u2019t care at all Whatever the reason for your criticism is I know what I am (I know what I am) I know what I want (I know what I want) I never gon\u2019 change (I never gon' change) I never gon\u2019 trade About loving yourself no matter what. My blood, sweat, and tears My body, mind, and soul I know well they're all yours This is a spell that will punish me About lust, love & foolishness. I'm not a superhero Don't expect a lot I can be your hero I'm really not sure whether that even makes sense But mom, i really need to do it Who's gonna do it if it isn't me? You can call me, say Anpan About being a hero, when you're weak in your outside. Overall, i want to say that they have got very meaningful lyrics, since their concept was to stop the stereotypes, criticism and expectations that are fired at young people like bullets. They told us to love ourselves no matter what. They are really open books. Marks: 9.5/10 (almost perfect)  BlackPink  The dancing light surrounds me Black to the pink We're special no matter what, oh yesI don't care if you stare I wanna dance like Ddaradara-danddan ddaradara-danddan Tudurubbau Their songs talk about party. Don't leave me before the dark night traps me in Do you still love me? If you feel the same, don't leave today Don't ask why it has to be you Just stay with me About love. After a sweet \"hi\", there's always a bitter \"bye\" After every crazy high, there\u2019s a price you have to pay There\u2019s no answer to this test I\u2019ll always fall for it yes I\u2019m a slave to my emotions Screw this heartless love And about killing toxic love. So, summing up, BlackPink songs' lyrics are mostly meaningless, since they have got a badass concept. But, they also talk about love and they have also worked on killing toxic love. Marks: 3.5/10 (really low)  NOTE: you know that mostly BTS write their songs on their own. They are credited of writing exactly 73 songs as of now (July 2020). Meanwhile, only Jennie of all BlackPink girls has written a song named Stay, which she wasn't even credited for! So, it's the fault of their messy company and especially Teddy if they have got party BOPs and love songs and nothing else, not of the poor girls! By the way, i'm sharing this quote with you guys, in case you didn't know of its existence.  See you around ~lina ",
