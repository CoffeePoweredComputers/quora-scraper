            "answer_text": "I wouldn't consider myself a heavy Mandapop listener, but I do have perhaps one suggestion that might fit the bill, assuming that you haven't heard of them yet. Go check out Mayday (\u4e94\u6708\u5929), a Taiwan-based rock group with influences from Japanese-Rock bands such Mr. Children to Classic Rock era bands such as Deep Purple. Many of their songs have a wide variety of sounds, most of them fairly upbeat, ranging from heavy guitar riff driven pieces, to more laid-back pop sounding ones similar to 2 examples given in the question. A few of my favourites would be:  \u50b7\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u5225\u807d\u6162\u6b4c (Pretty rudimentary pop-rock sounding)\u4e09\u4e2a\u50bb\u74dc (When a rock group tries to do swing, and it worked out pretty well)\u6e29\u67d4 (This one counts as a ballad, but it's worth a mention because it's their breakthrough song of sorts.)",

            "answer_text": "I completely understand what you mean by trying to find an upbeat Chinese song! When I first started listening to Chinese music I was always tired of getting into a bad mood as a result of listening to mandopop. However, I did find a few songs that are of upbeat mood. (Some upbeat songs in China aren\u2019t really the best, so it takes a while to find a good upbeat song as well) G.E.M - \u65b0\u7684\u5fc3\u8df3 (xin de xin tiao)\u5f20\u6770 (zhang jie) - \u9006\u6218\u5f20\u9753\u9896 (Zhang Liang Ying) - She has a few songs that are upbeat, just try some of them",
