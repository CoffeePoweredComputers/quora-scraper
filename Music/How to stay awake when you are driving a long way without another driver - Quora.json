            "answer_text": "It has been a number of years since I have driven like this. I would get up and try and be on the road by 6am. I would drive as far as I could, making only stops for gas (I would use the bathroom and get food/drinks at the same stop for gas), and usually around midnight that evening I would pull over into a truck stop. I would park with the trucks. Usually after 3 hours, I would wake up and hit back on the road. Drive for another hour then stop and sleep for another 2 to 3 hours, before getting back on the road to my final destination. These trips were from Minnesota to Arizona and back. One time I did fall asleep at the wheel. I was driving home to Minnesota, from Wisconsin. I was less than 5 miles from the house. I was on a two lane highway and out in the middle of nowhere. I start dozing and the next thing I remember is looking ahead and seeing my car headed for the ditch on the right side of the road. I turn the wheel to the left, but I over-steer and end up going into the ditch on the left side of the road. This was late September early October, so the corn stalks were high and I drove into the corn field, about the length of a semi truck. My windshield was shattered from all the corn stalks hitting against it. I put the car in reverse and drove out of there and made it home. I was wide awake the remainder of the way. I got home and went straight to bed. The next morning, I was looking over the damage and noticed my front license plate was missing (In Minnesota they require a front license plate on vehicles). I drove back to the scene of the \u201ccrime\u201d and found my license plate in the corn field. I quickly grabbed the evidence and went home. ",

            "answer_text": "Many years ago, when I was younger - I travelled about 300 miles (one way) to spend time with my parents - I did this about 5x/year - and my little son (pre-school) was my passenger. He would usually fall asleep within an hour. I usually left after work on a Friday, and I would arrive at my destination about 6\u20137 hours later \u2026 I knew that when fatigued - I could succumb to \u201chighway hypnosis.\u201d And, to take care of myself, and my little son - I made sure I had an early bed-time the night before my trip, stopped to eat a lunch prepared at home, if I felt a bit weary \u2026 parked, locked the car (my son sleeping) \u2026 got out somewhere well-lit, and walked around a bit. I also drank water - knowing I would have to make stops to urinate - and that taking those \u201cpee-breaks\u201d were necessaryl. There were times when I had had a hard week at work, and was bleary-eyed with still a good distance to my destination \u2026 I would pull my car into a spot, and sleep for 15\u201320 minutes - carried a little pocket timer. When the timer signified time to hit the road again, I\u2019d get out of the car and walk around in the fresh air for another 5 minutes or so. And, having lost 3 brothers in 3 different car \u201caccidents\u201d \u2026 I did *not* want my parents to have to deal with yet another loss \u2026 this was a great motivating factor to \u201ctake care of myself for myself, my son and my parents.\u201d ",
