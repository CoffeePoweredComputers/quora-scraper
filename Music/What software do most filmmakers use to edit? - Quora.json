            "answer_text": "Professional video editors tend to use the most capable and complicated software that there is. Preferences of professional can vary greatly depending on what he or she used to work with. It even can be some cryptic soft like Edius, but most of the time professionals choose one of the below: 1.Adobe Premiere Pro  This is maybe the most widely used professional video editing software. Adobe is widely known in the software world and Premiere Pro is no exception. Premiere Pro has a vast number of features that are complemented by the whole of the Creative Cloud, which includes software like After Effects and Photoshop. Also, Premiere supports a lot of video and audio plugins which makes its abilities almost endless. In short, this is the first video editor that you should try to use. 2.Avid Media Composer  This is the professional video editing software with a long history. It is used in many Hollywood films \u2014 check their site with all the stories about making films like \u201cIt\u201d. The software itself is very powerful but complicated in my opinion. If you have some questions about it, you can ask Del de la Haye \u2014 he is the biggest Avid fan around here :) 3.Final Cut Pro  This one is the famous Mac-only software by Apple. Nowadays it may be not as renown as before, but it\u2019s still a very popular software with an exceptionally beautiful interface. Most of the professionals that use Apple computers tend to use Final Cut Pro as well. Perhaps, it\u2019s the easiest one to learn from the whole of this list. 4.Vegas Pro  Another big name in video editing. This one is almost as popular as Premiere Pro. Windows-only, unfortunately. Vegas for formerly a Sony software, but now it is developed by MAGIX company from Germany. This software is also very capable with an immense number of features. A little less than Premiere Pro, perhaps, but many more than a home user would need anyone. Get the trial version to learn for yourself. Hope it\u2019s helpful! ",
