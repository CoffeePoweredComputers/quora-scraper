            "answer_text": "In the Rap world, this is done on a regular basis. It\u2019s called a Diss Track. You think the Rock band\u2019s could learn a thing or two from them! Well actually the Rockers scored first, and often. It\u2019s just not a big deal to them. Today\u2019s stars know how to drop bombs, no doubt. But they learned from the best. \u201cYour So Vain\u201d - Carly Simon Always loved this one. But gotta admit, the fact that the identity of the \u2018perpetrator\u2019 is still unknown just makes it all the more better. Is it Mick, who sang backgrounds on the track? Or Warren Beatty, as we all originally suspected? Somebody even said it was Cat Stevens. Can\u2019t imagine him with an apricot scarf! \u201cHow Do You Sleep\u201d - John Lennon Following the Beatles break-up, McCartney\u2019s LP \u201cRam\u201d has a track \u2018Too Many People\u2019, which some say was a barb against Yoko Ono\u2019s involvement with John. In Lennon\u2019s \u201cHow Do You Sleep\u201d he gave back as well as received, and then some. Cryptic and pointed, everybody knew what it was about. You would\u2019ve thought they were married! \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d - Lynyrd Skynrd As an answer to Neil Young\u2019s \u201cSouthern Man\u201d, Ronnie Van Zant proudly sang about Southern life and culture. And while it did become a big deal, sort of. Young and Van Zant would become good friends up until Ronnie\u2019s passing several years later. \u201cDeath on Two Legs\u201d - Queen No! Not Freddie too.. Yes, even Mercury the anointed one can have a barb up his *** once in awhile. Written about Queen manager Norman Sheffield. If you saw \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 you know all about it. If you didn\u2019t, Sheffield is blamed for a lot of things that went wrong with Freddie and the band. But he did put them in a position to become world-famous, something that Freddie would later regret. \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d - Fleetwood Mac Buckingham\u2019s response to his break-up with Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac might not have written the book on checking, but they sure contributed a few chapters during the turbulent Seventies. \u201cSorrow Will Come In The End\u201d - Morrissey Is it true this happened a decade after the demise of \u2018The Smiths\u2019? Morrissey and Johnny Marr were sued by ex-drummer Mike Joyce and lost! At least they got a cool track out of it! \u201cSorrow\u201d became so controversial, it was removed from all future U.K. pressings. \u201cPlay With Fire\u201d - The Rolling Stones When I was a kid, we were told this was Mick\u2019s diss on The Beatles. Now I\u2019m told it\u2019s about a high society girl and her rich parents. That probably seems correct, but who knows? Are the Stones playing this song live again? Dunno, but it\u2019s a great song!
