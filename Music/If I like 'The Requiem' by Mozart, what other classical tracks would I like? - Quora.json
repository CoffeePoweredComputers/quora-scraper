            "answer_text": "How to figure out your Classical music taste if you start from the very top, i.e. Mozart\u2019s Requiem?I was in the same situation 12 years ago after my parents took me to a performance of K. 626. I wasted a lot of time doing my amateur music research wrong and just listening to random Classical music. I ended up knowing the Requiem by heart and being a Mozart addict anyway. Here\u2019s what I would do now. Focus on Mozart for now. There was no (and probably never will be) other composer capable of writing works which are complex but at the same time so naturally musical they are accessible. You should be aware of the uniqueness of Mozart - it won\u2019t be easy to tell what else you may like based on your preference towards Mozart. He enriched the seemingly established Classical style so much he practically created a new style from scratch (how Haydn\u2019s music changed under influence of Mozart is a great display of that impact). You already know you like his Requiem, so why not dive into something else by him:\u2018Great\u2019 Mass in C minorPiano Concerto no. 20 in D minorPiano Concerto no. 24 in C minorSymphony no. 40 in G minorString Quintet in G minorPiano Sonata no. 8 in A minor\u201cAch, ich f\u00fchl's\u201d from Die Zauberfl\u00f6te The above selection is to help you figure out your preferences. There are two possible outcomes: 1. You liked all of the works to a similar degree. You most probably like Mozart as such. You should try some major key Mozart as your next step, for example:\u201cCoronation\u201d Mass in C majorPiano Concerto no. 21 in C majorPiano Concerto no. 23 in A majorSymphony no. 41 in C major \u2018Jupiter\u2019String Quintet in Eb majorPiano Sonata no. 12 in F major\u201cA che mi dice mai\u201d from Don Giovanni If again you liked them to a similar degree the verdict is you like Mozart. There\u2019s a wonderful Mozart 225 edition by Decca. Also listen to Haydn, Danzi, Hummel, Krommer, Rosetti, Eybler, Boccherini and other contemporaries or pupils of Mozart. Chances are you won\u2019t like them all to a similar degree so just stick to Classical period and explore. You will most probably dislike Beethoven (at least all Mozart fans I know, myself included, do) and enjoy some good Vivaldi while J.S. Bach will feel too heavy most of the time. Don\u2019t bother 1830 or later for now, it\u2019s just brass and high register violin to Mozartean ear. I know people and tastes differ but for some reason the tastes of me and all my fellow Mozarteans are pretty much aligned. If not, then you like darker music, in which case you should venture into early and mid-Romantic era. I\u2019d recommend Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, maybe some Brahms. Tchaikovsky will tell you a lot, if you like him then you can go big and brassy like Berlioz, Wagner and Verdi. If you feel a certain fondness for music of Dvorak then check some film music. 2. You liked some of the works more than others. If so, then you probably like some instrumentation more than others.\u2018Great\u2019 Mass - choral music, try as much choral as possible, from Palestrina through Monteverdi, Bach, Mozart and Berlioz to Verdi, and see what suits you.Piano Concerti - you like some virtuosic piano, be sure to check later piano music like Chopin and Rachmaninov, also some Paganini to see if it\u2019s just about the piano or virtuosity in general.Symphony - hurry for some symphonies by Haydn and Beethoven; if Beethoven doesn\u2019t convince you stick to Mozart and try some Baroque instrumental music; if Beethoven feels great go along the timeline listening to symphonies until you hit Mahler.String Quintet - a chamber music fan, now that\u2019s a rare thing, are you sure you\u2019re not a musician in disguise? My advice may seem weird, but consider picking up musical self-education as a hobby; chamber music is so different from other genres it requires some deeper knowledge to understand and in the process of gaining that knowledge you will discover your tastes for subgenres and styles anyway.Piano Sonata - you like solo piano works: listen to a lot of excerpts to find the style you prefer, from harpsichord music of Bach through Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Rachmaninov, Satie\u2026 the list is long and you would do yourself a favour if you spent some time checking YouTube just to figure out the names worth exploring further.Aria - an opera fan; the thing is Mozart is again unique in his writing so you may enjoy Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Die Zauberfl\u00f6te and Idomeneo but hate any other opera; try Rossini and Verdi to taste something different for a start.

            "answer_text": "I agree with all the suggestions posted so far. Here are some more suggestions for choral works and funeral music by composers other than Mozart. Another great requiem is the one by Verdi. There is a very fine Blu-ray disc of a live performance at La Scala Milan; the great Daniel Barenboim conducting, and a stellar quartet of soloists. That performance is also available for less money on CD or as a download. There are many recordings of Bach\u2019s B minor Mass (arguably the greatest of all choral works). If you want a blu-ray, I suggest Georg Christoph Biller\u2019s disc, recoded live for Accentus Music in Bach\u2019s own St Thomas Kirche in Leipzig. Something earlier still: Henry Purcell\u2019s funeral music for Queen Mary II of England, and especially his setting of, \u201cThou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts\u201d. Wonderful music! There are many notable funeral marches, but two of the mightiest are Beethoven\u2019s (from his 3rd Symphony, the Eroica) and Richard Wagner\u2019s (Siegfried\u2019s funeral music from the opera (or music-drama) G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung (aka the Twilight of the gods). A great favourite of (ahem) Adolf Hitler. Ironically, many, if not most, of the greatest Wagner conductors of the last 60 years have been Jewish. Hitler would have hated that. I\u2019m not sure that Wagner himself would have been all that happy either. ",
