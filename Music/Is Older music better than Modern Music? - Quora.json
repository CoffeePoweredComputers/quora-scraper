            "answer_text": "Both. The world never really changes. Mindsets change, leaders change, country boarders change, politics change, and cultures, rituals, and calendar dates change, but life and humans pretty much have been and will always be the same. Music has always been the same. New instruments, new sounds, new aesthetics are born, but many are old things reborn. Today\u2019s music is better than older music because it has decades and decades of history to stand on and reference. We can combine old aesthetics and old genres with new technology and methods of production to get amazing music like this\u2026  But at the same time, the music of the past was better because of the raw sound of a lot of the music, because the luxury of the modern technology we have now did not exist. So you got stuff like this\u2026  But in all honesty, it comes down to preference and taste. Some Gen Z kids may feel that music now a days is better because they connect with it more, while others may have a strong connection to the music they heard growing up in the 70\u2019s.  Personally, I believe that the music of the past was often better just for the quality of content. A majority of mainstream songs didn\u2019t have a lot of cussing or arrogant-minded themes, or themes of drugs and partying and whatnot. A lot of the songs DID, but I remember being able to listen to the radio as a kid, even just in the late 90s/early 2000s, and being able to enjoy whatever came on\u2026 but listening to the radio now is just a cringefest because of the content in a lot of songs. I also think the idea and concept of \u201celectronic dance music\u201d is attempted in mainstream music a lot and this mediocre form of dance music was born. It\u2019s not necessarily bad, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s not as good when compared to the genuine dance music genres. BUT someone else, I\u2019m 100% sure, would absolutely disagree and they are just as valid. It all comes down to the preference, bias, taste, and background of the ones listening. ",

            "answer_text": "There is good music whereever you look. I find great modern music (just not the crap they give Grammy\u2019s to, and play on the radio), and there is great older music, and again a lot of it they didn\u2019t play on the radio, and if they did they played the hit, and left a lot of it on the albums and singles. Occasionally the mainstream and the underground find a place to meet up for a minute. There was a period in the early to mid 90\u2019s where cool alternative and grunge bands found a place in the spotlight. Then they were exploited, people formed watered down versions of those bands, and it got crap again in the mainstream. In the early 80\u2019s you had some cool New Wave bands that got attention because they jumped into video making before anyone else and rode the first wave of MTV success. They had a few hits, but again a lot of their albums were missed out on, but hey they got noticed. The last 60\u2019s had a lot of cool artist in the mainstream, some got to experiment, but again the mainstream co-opted it, watered it down and so you still find cool garage and psych single and records from that era that never got top 10 play, but are still brilliant. On to today. I am always looking for and finding cool stuff. Just off the top of my head I have listened to some cool new stuff like the Advisory Circle, Sleaford Mods, Jenny Hval, and Car Seat Headrest in the last year, and that\u2019s just scratching the surface. The key to good music, is looking for good music, not just letting it be force fed to you. ",
