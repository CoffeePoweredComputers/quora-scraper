            "answer_text": "Yes or no, depending on how you\u2019re looking at it. If you\u2019re harmonizing a tune, you\u2019re building chords to support the melody. Some chords will be \u201cnative\u201d to the key - and by that I mean that if you write them out in standard notation you won\u2019t need any accidentals (other than those in your key signature). If you\u2019re in the key of F, a C7 chord is \u201cnative\u201d, because the notes C-E-G-Bb can all be written without an accidental - the B is flat in the key signature. A chord that isn\u2019t native to your key would be an \u201coutside\u201d chord - if you wanted a G major chord in the key of F, you\u2019d need an accidental (a natural) to write the B note. So if you\u2019re in the key of F, a G major chord isn\u2019t in the scale you\u2019re harmonizing from. Now let\u2019s go the other way. You\u2019ve got a chord, and you\u2019re trying to construct a scale. Let\u2019s say the chord is Cmaj7#11, or C-E-G-B-F#. You can certainly construct a scale around that - C Lydian is one option (C-D-E-F#-G-A-B). Scales are a melodic construct, and chords are are a harmonic construct. So yes, you can have a chord that contains \u201cnon-melodic\u201d notes (or notes outside your key), and no, you can\u2019t form a chord that has no possible associated scale. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like you are asking whether all the chords you choose for your composition have to belong to the same key. The answer is a definite no. When one note in a chord is different from the home key, this could be a \u201csecondary dominant\u201d chord, or possibly a \u201cborrowed chord (from a parallel mode).\u201d An example of a secondary dominant here in the key of C: C E Am (where the E chord is the dominant of A minor, but Am IS in the key of C and E isn\u2019t.) An example of a borrowed mode chord is from \u201cIt\u2019s Been A Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d by the Beatles, in the key of G: G C G F G (where the F contains an F natural, borrowed from G mixolydian mode, instead of the usual F sharp from G major). So go ahead and play whatever chords sound good to you. Many students have ears that are better than their sense of analysis, so there is probably a good explanation for just about any chord you pick, even though you don\u2019t know what the explanation is. As to your second question, there is no rule to start on the I chord (tonic chord) nor finish on the I chord, as long as you establish what key you are in by some means. This is not a usual problem, so go ahead and write what seems proper to you. ",

            "answer_text": "A chord is actually a scale played in 3rds , so the C major chord can contain C E G B D F A , now we all relate differently as to why we would extend a chord in this way , and if all the above notes are played together there is a tension when we get to the F ( the 11th note) ( which corresponds to the 4th in the scale) . so we alter this note and make it an F# , this gives us the Lydian mode , this is familiar territory to jazz players , but to those starting out can be a little confusing , as in most of our listening we don\u2019t encounter this principle , popular chart music almost never gets to chord extensions like this . The fact is all scales and chords are the same information as each other , that includes the frequently used jazz modes and altered scales , ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can play a chord of three notes, one of which is not in the current scale. Probably the most common example is the dominant of the dominant, refered to as the secondary dominant. For instance, in the key of C Major, play a D Major chord (containing an F#, obviously.) This chord resolves to a G Major chord ( the dominant in C Major) which in turn resolves to the tonic. And no, you certainly don\u2019t need to start with a tonic chord. Why would you? And, while much tonal music ends on the tonic, it\u2019s not uncommon to end on a dominant chord and that can sound fine if done properly. ",

Look at any jazz song book and you\u2019ll see chords like this all over the place. They\u2019re called \u201ctension\u201d chords, and they\u2019re partially responsible for giving jazz its characteristic sound. A more mundane example would be the progression C, C7, F, G7 C. The C7 chord (C, E, G, Bb) contains a note (Bb) that\u2019s not native to the C scale, but still sounds fine in context. ",
