            "answer_text": "Opera, like Mozilla and Microsoft, aren't avoiding Webkit because it's open source. We believe that we have technology offerings that are as good or better and so we will continue to build our own rendering engines (along with our own JavaScript engines, and front end technologies and features). The web has never been in better shape than it is now with robust competition moving the state of the art forward at a swift clip. Trident, Webkit, Gecko, and Presto are each pushing the other to be more capable and faster. Chakra, V8, Nitro, SpiderMonkey, and Carakan each challenge each other to be the fastest.  This is a good thing. ",
