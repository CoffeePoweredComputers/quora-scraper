            "answer_text": "Because not every arrangement sounds good, and variations need not be drastic. And of course, for hundreds of years now, music has been at the mercy of the people who consume it. First: not every arrangent sounds good. There is of course a limit of twelve notes for the Western chromatic scale. That in itself is a limit. Of the many combinations coming from that, few sound good. Still, of those that sound good, fewer sound good to most people's ears. That is why when you study music theory, it talks about harmony and consonance and resolution - things that happen when certain things line up, which means, it will not always happen, therefore not all the arrangements for music are ever used. Of course, good sounding music is loved by people. If you don't make the music people like, you won't earn anything as a composer, or worse in the old times could actually get you killed. So then quite obviously, artists will only make music that make sense to the masses, people of good taste, and critics. That means the rest of the possible arrangements of music are not used for the good of all. Now, what makes music from each era different? Why does it seem that there are infinite variations when there aren't? Simply, because these variations are used for long periods of time until people get quite tired of hearing the same thing. When that happens (or when the call of art or money is heard), then a new variation is made. It doesn't have to be so drastic. There was once a time when music was monophonic. The next variation to that was simply a group of people or instruments singing in unison. The next variation is then adding the third to make a harmony. Then the fifth was eventually added. This journey from one note, to many of the same note, to two notes, to three, took hundreds of years to develop. And that's just notes. Timbres are also critical to musical arrangent. New instruments and timbres are made all the time. But again, they take years to develop and they stay for years. Take the electric guitar for example. Guitar distortion has been present for the past 70 years, and there have been few variations of that sound (and only two main classes - low and high gain). People have not yet advanced distorted guitars too far from where they were fifty years ago. That's two changes to the timbre of electric guitar in over 70 years. That's why it seems that there are still so much we can do with music, despite its limitations. ",

            "answer_text": "Well we can start with some other combinations. Make an 8 digit number using 0\u201310 without restriction and you get [math]10^8[/math] different ways to arrange them. That\u2019s 100 million ways from 8 numbers. With DNA, we have 4 DNA base nucleotides, that in triplet codon sequence are able to encode up to 20 different amino acids. Then these amino acids group together to form peptides (proteins) with deeper tertiary and quarternary structures. Humans have over 20,000 protein coding genes but plenty more proteins when you add the ways they can be folded and mixed. With music, you have many variables on top of your standard notes. You have duration that forms your rhythm, employment of rests, dynamics, plus an array of different instruments and timbres to play with. You can change the tempo and style, move up or down keys. You can form many different complex harmonies. All in all you have many different ways to play with and layer music and that\u2019s before we get to electronic effects and modulation. This might amuse you:     Lots of variety. Even damn Toto can do so much  ",
