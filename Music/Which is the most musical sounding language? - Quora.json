            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends highly on the person who is listening to a song. It is obvious that the person would prefer to hear songs in a language that he is well versed with. Listening to a song in a language that is unfamiliar to that person can please a person only on the basis of rhythm or melody or beats of that song; but in such a case , the lyrics can be understood only after a translation is viewed. This however is not the case in case the song is listened to in a known language. (For e.g - Listen to Hotel California :p\u2026..its lyrics will amaze you !) However it seems to me that you are interested in knowing probably which language is most popularly used for hearing / composing songs. The probably the answer should be English. ",

            "answer_text": "Listening for hours to the music from all over the world, I have found that the best singing languages are those with\u2026 Precise articulation of both vowels and consonants. An example: Spanish, Turkish (and generally Turkic languages), Italian, some African languages like Xhosa, Basque, Hungarian, Finnish. A negative example: Russian, English.Wide range and intonations. An example: Spanish, Georgian, Swahili, native American languages like Tzotzil or Cofan, Sukuma (an African language spoken in Tanzania), English, Portuguese; a negative example: Czech, Arabic, Hebrew;Strong rhythm. An example: Spanish, Hebrew, Turkish, Mongolian, some African and native American languages. A negative example: Czech, Belarussian, American English.So\u2026In the intersection we find Spanish, the aboriginal languages of Africa and America and the Turkic ones. They sound best when sung, in my opinion and experience. ",
