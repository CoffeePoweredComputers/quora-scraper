            "answer_text": "I think that the difference in popularity might owe to the differing (historical) functions or perceptions of each instrument. The cello is likely perceived as an instrument that sooner takes a prominent musical role than the viola; that prominence likely attracts more positive attention. During the early establishment of the orchestra dating back to the Baroque age, neither the viola nor the cello were employed all that frequently as prominent melodic or soloistic instruments. There are obvious exceptions such as Vivaldi\u2019s cello concerti or Bach\u2019s orchestration of the Third Brandenburg Concerto which lets the violas take charge in turn with the violins and cellos. However, neither really got as many star turns as the violins. The solo repertoire for the violin for many decades has also dwarfed that for the viola or the cello. Then things started to change in the solo repertoire with contributions from Haydn who created two spectacular cello concerti, Beethoven\u2019s five sonatas for piano and cello, and an increasing number of features in the orchestral repertoire for the cello section. Off the cuff, have a difficult time thinking of many solo or ensemble features for viola from that same period of music history. Of course, as the history of western art music progressed, the number of features for viola increased: Berlioz\u2019s Harold in Italy, the sonatas for viola and piano by Brahms, and double concerti for viola and violin by Mozart are all good examples. Still, the cello has simply maintained a higher degree of prominence as a featured or solo instrument, I think. It also helps that the cello is such an expressive instrument with its powerful tone and its wide range; many suggest that the cello has the instrumental sound the most similar to the human voice which many listeners find compellingly engaging.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure that it is. There are probably as many violists and violinists capable of playing the viola as there are cellists. The viola is a beautiful instrument, although that is typically in spite of its limitations. Two big limitations for the viola: It uses violin technique but is much larger than a violin. That means it\u2019s physically difficult technically, takes more effort to get a good sound from, and the larger weight on the posture is physically strenuous for the arm, back, and neck.It\u2019s not big enough. It\u2019s not 50% of the size of a cello, it\u2019s not proportionately bigger than a violin. It\u2019s not in the right proportions for an instrument of its pitch, and the strings and projection suffer for it.So as much as I love to grab a viola and play it cello style on my lap for a gag, the sound is and should be different and darker tone than other strings. And violists love it. And violists are, with so very few exceptions, amongst the loveliest humans of the orchestra. And that\u2019s enough to make them the secret treasures of the orchestra. ",
