            "answer_text": "Corporate radio took over a long time ago. That is why you hear nothing \u201cdangerous\u201d today. Could you imagine a viciously anti-Trump tune getting any airplay at all? Years ago, when the first internet radio stations started out in the Bay Area, the industry squashed them real fast. The reult is that 5 assholes in New York and another 5 assholes in LA pretty much decide what kids hear, unless they have a local band who they follow. Those bands are out there, but finding them is really really hard. On Youtube, there is so much noise that finding quality is very very hard. If you can figure out a solution, then do share it. Or make money with it. PS - I think that what is happening is a shift to synth based music. Guitar based rock is likely over, but we will see. There may also be a small shift to acoustic guitar based music to accompany this larger trend. ",
