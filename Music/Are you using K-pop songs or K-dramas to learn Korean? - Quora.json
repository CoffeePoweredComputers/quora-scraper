            "answer_text": "Yes me it was a lot easier to learn Korean because I liked watching kdramas and listening to kpop so it made it fun to learn Korean and easier for me to remember. Words or sentence that actors keep repeating makes it easier for me to remember. And when listening to a korean song having the translate English transfer makes it easier for me to know what the sentence means. I also learned by repeating the sentence or words that they say or sing a lot so I can listen to my own pronunciation. Hope that this help I also watch kvariety shows and news with English subtitles most of the time to learn words that aren\u2019t being said in dramas or songs. And also it\u2019s really helps to find 1 or 2 Korean friend that you can talk to so you can learn to speak and read ",

It is an easier way to get it into my head and confirm I actually understand the words without reading the subtitles. I mostly watch and listen to Korean-anything just to feel happy. I love the happy endings in most Korean dramas and, of course, I love, love, love anything BTS. TTFN! ",
