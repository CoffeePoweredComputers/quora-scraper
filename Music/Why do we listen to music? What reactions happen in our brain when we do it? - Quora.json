            "answer_text": "Not everyone listens to music and those who do listen to very different forms of music so it may be difficult to pin down to one reason why someone listens to music. I can tell you why I listen to music, and each kind / genre of music has its own unique effect that I find myself responding to. But let\u2019s start from the beginning; when we first evolved about 200,000 years ago, life was relentlessly harsh and dangerous. Any sound evoked a corresponding image which meant threat or non-threat. Obviously we prefer the sounds which are non-threatening, like birds chirping, over the deep guttural roar of a major predator on the hunt. So evolutionary biology - as always - provides the answer to why we respond the way we do to the many and varied signals we perceive. Now, in the conditions of modern life with its relative safety, we are able to listen to all kinds of music, even crashing symbols which would frighten a Stone Age person out of their wits, with impunity and even pleasure. The thrill of sound is nearly universal and is based on our evolutionary response to sounds. Bear in mind, the oldest fossil of a musical instrument, so far found, is a bird\u2019s hollow thigh bone drilled out as a flute. It is 40,000 years old! So we\u2019ve been at this for a long time. I imagine we were banging on hollow logs long before someone drilled a thigh bone (how did they figure that out the holes would make different pitches, clever humans). Now to analyze music; lyrics aside, there are three basic structural elements to music: melody (sequence of pitches), harmony (relations between pitches) and rhythm. There is also the unique harmonic signature of each instrument, so-called timbre (pronounced \u201ctamber\u201d) which is not relevant for this analysis. Pitches make pitch intervals; one pitch carries little meaning to the listener but two pitches already mean something. The relation between any two pitches - the pitch interval - is the degree of consonance / dissonance. The most consonant pitch interval is the tonic - octave interval, what we would call in the Do Re Mi scale Do tonic - Do octave. This pitch interval (for short, we just say \u201coctave\u201d) is pure consonance, no dissonance at all. The next most consonant interval is called in music the 5th because it is Do-Sol and Sol is the 5th step in Do Re Mi Fa Sol. All pitch intervals can be represented by a ratio of vibrations (frequencies). In order of maximum consonance to increasing dissonance: Tonic - Octave (Do-Do) 1:2 Tonic - 5th (Do-Sol) 2:3 Tonic - 4th (Do-Fa) 3:4 Tonic - Major 6th (Do-La) 3:5 Tonic - Major 3rd (Do-Mi) 4:5 Tonic - Minor 3rd (Do-Mi bimol) 5:6 Tonic - Minor 6th (Do-La bimol) 5:8 Tonic - Minor 7th (Do-Si bimol) 5:9 Tonic - Major 2nd (Do-Re) 8:9 Tonic - Major 7th (Do-Si) 8:15 Tonic - Minor 2nd (Do-Re bimol) 15:16 Tonic - Diminished 5th (Do-Sol bimol) 32:45 That last pitch interval is also called the \u201ctritone\u201d because physically (spatially on a piano or fretboard) it is in the center between the bottom Do and the top Do of the Tonic - Octave interval. Sometimes it is called the augmented 4th rather than the diminished 5th, but that\u2019s a musicological detail. The point is, every pitch interval has a proportion of consonance and dissonance. This has nothing to do with whether a given individual likes consonance or dissonance; this is a fact of physics and can be demonstrated on an oscilloscope. The tonic - octave interval has total consonance, zero dissonance, and all the other pitch intervals have varying degrees of some dissonance, which we hear / feel as a kind of third vibration that seems to emanate from the two notes interacting in the same medium. To illustrate the next point, I want to isolate two pitch intervals and compare them, the Major 3rd (Do-Mi) and the Minor 3rd (Do-Mi bimol). Note to USA musicians; \u201cbimol\u201d is the French way of saying \u201cflat\u201d. Also, they say \u201cSi\u201d rather than \u201cTi\u201d for the 7th. When you play the minor 3rd and the major 3rd, alternating between the two, you will, if you pay careful attention, notice the very different moods they elicit in us; the mood of the minor 3rd feels like a yearning for something unknown and unnamable, but the instant you play the major 3rd, that yearning clears up completely. Go back and forth between these two proximal pitch intervals and you will see (feel) what I mean. Since 1974, I have given this lecture demonstration to music students in colleges, universities, academies, schools and museums all over the world and obtained the same results always; people respond to these pitch intervals. They are responding to the difference in consonance / dissonance in those pitch intervals. The pitch interval of less consonance makes us yearn for the relative \u201charmony\u201d of the pitch interval of greater consonance. That is what pitch intervals do to us; they make us yearn for harmony, or they deliver harmony. When a melody is crafted, it is a journey through the consonance / dissonance scale. This journey will lead us to expect, to anticipate a destination, so to speak, of the pitch interval of maximum consonance. This is why so many compositions end on the tonic or octave note, to deliver the deep satisfaction of maximum consonance as the note or chord of harmonious resolution. Some compositions deliberately leave us hanging by playing a final note which is not the tonic - octave pitch interval. To demonstrate the most extreme example of that, play the tonic, then every note of the diatonic scale (all the white keys of the piano starting with C as the tonic) but do not play the octave interval; you will suffer the feeling of incompleteness. Some musicians / composers are so sensitive to this annoying feeling of unfinished business, unresolved music, they can even get a bit hostile until they get to hear that \u201cfinal\u201d note, the octave. Either consciously or subconsciously, composers compose melodies - and in some genres, supporting harmonies - which take us on a journey of consonance and dissonance; expectation of harmonious / consonant resolution leads us to want to listen to the next note, the next note, and so on. We get a feeling of pleasure / reward from anticipating and then experiencing the closure of total consonance. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do we listen to music? What reactions happen in our brain when we do it? First: Why do we listen to music? Those who do listen to music are filling up their CPU time with the thoughts, sounds, and attitudes reflected by the thoughts of someone else\u2019s mind. Having never been taught what thinking really can be, while being exposed to all the cognitive dissonance programming, the brain-abused individual becomes more in tune with their emotions for total lack of any thinking power. If you are one of those who \u201cbuds-in and tunes out\u201d the rest of the non-thinking world, believing that makes things all better, consider what life would be like if you could think a lot more clearly? Does the thought of being in a dimly lit room staring at a blank wall in silence scare you? Having no sound track to fill in your inability to think? Having no screen to dazzle your eyes? Having no inputs from other non-thinking people? Is that the kind of thing that would blow your mind? What reactions happen in our brain when we do it? Our hunger for thinking is totally squelched with our CPU\u2019s being distracted by the music, our emotions, and all the feelings it brings, covering up our inability to think for ourselves. This is \u201cback sliding\u201d time for those who continue. So much less time to get their thinker started. Having been programmed, not taught what thinking is, and having music to soothe us, pacifies us. ",
