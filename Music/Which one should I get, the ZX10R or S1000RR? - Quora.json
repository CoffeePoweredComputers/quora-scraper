            "answer_text": "the ZX-10R competes in a highly competitive segment, one which the BMW S 1000 RR turned on its head when it was introduced in 2009. The S 1000 RR was, as many of you are likely aware, made originally for the purpose of competing in the WSBK, but its success was far greater in commerce than on the track.  While the Euro-bikes\u2019 engine and chassis designs are all over the board, the S1000RR architecture is completely in line with the ZX-10R, as well as every other Japanese sportbike\u2019s. Of the two, the BMW boasts greater power and a superior traction-control system. While both bikes are limited to just four TC settings, the Beemer\u2019s are more refined, offering less intrusive wheelie control and more consistent and transparent slide management. ",
