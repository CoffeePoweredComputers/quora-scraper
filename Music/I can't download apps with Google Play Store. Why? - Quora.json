            "answer_text": "If you are looking to download a certain app from the Play Store but can't find it, it may not be compatible with your device. If you can find the link to the app on the play store and open it in your phone, the install button will not show up and it will instead tell you that your phone isn't compatible with the app. However, this may be a mistake on the developer's side to let the Play Store think it's not compatible with your device when actually, it is. You may be able to find an apk (installer file) of the app you are looking for on the web, install it, and the app could work fine. This usually won't be the case, but I have seen it happen from personal experience. I highly discourage downloading apps from apks instead of the Play Store though, if avoidable, as you won't be supporting the developer this way. ",

The app is not available for your device. 2. You have no disk storage. b) If Play Store doesn\u2019t connect to Internet: 3. Check you have correct time & date. Maybe that old phones lost the internal battery that keeps time & date and you must configure it manually. This affects to connections certification. ",
