            "answer_text": "Could be a lot of reasons. You aren\u2019t a naturally gifted singer. What this really means is that you didnt grow up singing or in a musical environment, and just never learned (which anybody can do believe it or not!)The songs just arent in your range. Popular music and popular karaoke songs are often sung by artists with naturally higher voices, making it tough for someone with a low voice to sing along with. Be more selective with your song choices and pick artists with similar voices to you. Doesnt make you a bad singer; like trying to wear clothes that are 2 sizes smaller than you are, its just not the right fit for you!Confidence! You could be a great singer but just get very nervous and tense up when you are singing in front of others. Loosen up!Your voice how you hear it sounds very different the way others hear it. This has to do with acoustics, resonance and how the sound travels but ultimately does mean you can sound a lot better than what you think you sound like in your head. To test, record yourself and play it back!At the end of the day, karaoke isnt about who sings the best (coming from someone who goes to karaoke with some very talented people). I like going to karaoke more with people who dont take it too seriously, they\u2019re a lot more fun! ",

            "answer_text": "I once worked with an amateur singer who had a big voice, and no musicianship. Learning notes was SOOOO hard for him. I worked with him a year later, and he was a different person, a pretty good musician. I asked if he had taken lessons, and he said, no, he\u2019d sung karaoke every weekend. It really builds your sense of counting, and I suspect counting may be one of your problems. If that\u2019s so, just keep at it. ",
