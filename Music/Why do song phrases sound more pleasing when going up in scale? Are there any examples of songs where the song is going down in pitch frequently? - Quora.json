            "answer_text": "What an interesting question. I have two John Lennon songs for you. In \u201cI Am The Walrus\", the verses are all descending. Then the chorus steadily ascends to its proclamation: I am the Walrus, GooGoo Ga Joob. \u201cWorking Class Hero\" has five phrases, which it repeats. The first line ends where it started (From the moment you're born, they make you feel small.) Line 2 goes up slightly (By giving you no time instead of it all.) Line 3 descends (till the pain is so big, you feel nothing at all.) The first line of the chorus starts on higher note than the verses, then descends. ( A working class hero is something to be.) Then it repeats. The last line of the chorus begins on the same note as the first verse, rises three notes, then descends to the lowest note of the song. (If you want to be a hero, then just follow me.) The predominantly descending phrases underscore the depressing message in the lyrics. Why does music affect emotions this way, you ask? I can't tell you. It just does. Going up uplifts us. Going down is a downer. I don't know if Working Class Hero is the best example of this, but it's the best one I can think of. I'm curious what other people will come up with. ",

            "answer_text": "Haha\u2026.really? Actually, you can say that in a restricted manner. When u raise pitch, we do three things Increase the clarityMaking it difficult for ordinary people to singAdding natural \u201cexciter\u201d and \u201csheen\u201dThese three makes ur song pleasing. However, we have a lot of lower register song that sound awesome. Every song have its identity in terms of its range, so every singer. Your word \u201cPleasing\u201d is thus synonym to \u201cExciting\u201d for me. But still there is a word \u201cConnecting\u201d. You can connect yourself to songs, sung in lower register with a greater feel. These are not attention seeker song, u will not jump from ur seat when u hear tyem first but they are connecting with your soul. Thatswhy, u dont hear high pitched song when u are sad, you want that connecting aspects between ur ear and heart. I am Indian music lover, examples from my lovely country are : High - Ae dil hai muskil(a) Chunar- ABCD (b) etcLow : Tose naina(c) Aaj phir tum pe (d)Listen : We dont talk anymore vs Hero Enrique, if you dont want to hear Indian music1 & 2 are all sung by same singer, Mr Arijit Singh. I have purposefully done that, so you can have a better sense of comparision. And ultimately, the ultimate nature of calmness that a low register song can be realised by the Classical music of Rabindranath Tagore. We call it Rabindrasangeet! Hear (e) Finally, if you want to know, exactly how the person himself sound, who is preaching such a notion, watch my Song on Youtube & Facebook link at the end (f) and (g). Thank You. a.  b.  c.  d.  e.  f  g CHUNAR | ABCD 2 | ARIJIT SINGH ",
