            "answer_text": "There are basically two ways to think about the best book out there. The most playable, interesting music is definitely the Bartok children's pieces. They're actually available for free online (download them here: For Children, Sz.42 (Bart\u00f3k, B\u00e9la)), and they're just generally great. A beginner can play the first pieces in the first book, and if you get through even just the first book, you're probably ready for intermediate-level stuff. The best finger trainers I've seen is the Dozen a Day. They're cute, and sort of fun, and most importantly they get your hands to do all the right stuff in the right order. Unfortunately they don't sound like pieces, so it's not easy to get excited about doing them. This book is going to be more like the most efficient homework you can do. ",

P.S I don't think a 4 yr old should find the best book to learn he should learn from someone it's more efficient. ",
