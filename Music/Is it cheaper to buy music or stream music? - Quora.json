            "answer_text": "Both of them are totally different. When you buy music or music album, you can have the music files all life. And you can also burn them to CD as you like and so on. Or streaming music service, as you know that Spotify, Apple Music and so on, you only cost litter and get the way to enjoy all the popular music files and so on. All the files can only work and play during you subscribe the service. When you cencel the subscription, sorry you can\u2019t play them any more even you have downloaded them for offline playing. Good news for stream music is that there are kinds of streaming music converter which can make the streaming music keep longer than you think. ",

The ads don't bother me and you'd have to deal with ads with YouTube anyway. The only thing I don't like is that ads are written specifically for Spotify and certain companies insult listeners. Not blaming Spotify, but some advertisers are dicks. I believe it was around Christmas time, for had an ad that had the line \u201cI hear you like deals. Oh who am I kidding. You're listening to ads on Spotify \u201c ",
