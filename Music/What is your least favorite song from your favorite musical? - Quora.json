            "answer_text": "I have to go with \u201cHundreds of Stories\u201d from In The Heights. But Jordan! you say. Isn\u2019t Hamilton your favorite musical? Meh. Not right now. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love Hamilton. It\u2019s a brilliant musical, but I think I wore myself out on it. It\u2019s all I listened to for the year surrounding when I saw it, so\u2026 I need a break. But I just can\u2019t stay away from LMM. In The Heights. Great show. You can\u2019t go wrong with LMM/Quiara Hudes. But \u201cHundreds of Stories\u201d has probably one of the worst introductions of exposition I\u2019ve ever heard. USNAVIAbuela, I don't know how I can keep it together ABUELA CLAUDIARemember the story of your nameIt was engraved on a passing ship on the day your family cameYou father said \"Usnavi\"That's what we'll name the baby USNAVIIt really said \"US Navy,\" but heyI worked with what they gave me okay ABUELA CLAUDIAThey'd be so proud of you today It comes out of nowhere. Usnavi\u2019s talking about his parents, about how hard it was to lose them and how he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do, and Abuela comes out with\u2026 that. \u201cRemember how your parents named you?\u201d Like, yeah, I\u2019m sure Usnavi does remember how his parents named him. I get that introducing a fact which everyone onstage knows is one of the hardest things to execute well, but LMM\u2026 did not execute it well. It hurts my ears whenever I hear it because it\u2019s so abrupt. I get why that fact needs to be there. I get why it\u2019s important. I just wish it\u2019d been introduced a little better. Besides that, this song just never meshed with me. It\u2019s fine, I guess. It just doesn\u2019t do it for me. Abuela\u2019s also not my favorite character (is that bad? I don\u2019t know) so I think a song that\u2019s mostly her isn\u2019t my cup o\u2019 tea. I take that back. I love \u201cPaciencia Y Ve\u201d. I think it\u2019s just this song I don\u2019t like.  I feel like I can\u2019t answer this without also giving my least favorite Hamilton song. It\u2019s a struggle, because I don\u2019t like Pippa Soo in this show, nor do I like Chris Jackson (love him in In The Heights, though). It\u2019s hard to pick a least favorite song separate of the actors. I probably have to give it to Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story. It\u2019s just\u2026 bland. I get why LMM ended it on Eliza\u2019s story, but I don\u2019t really care about Eliza. Her character was not super compelling in the show so having a whole song about her and her story was kind of just, cool, whatever, who cares. I almost wish he would\u2019ve ended it on The World Was Wide Enough. What a powerful ending. It would\u2019ve dropped the theme that\u2019s brought through in the actual last song, but damn\u2026 Ending on the line \u201cThe world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me.\u201d That\u2019s killer. Even then, though, it\u2019s not like I hate this song. It\u2019s fine. I struggled with even picking one because I really do love the vast majority of the songs in the show. Even my least favorites are just songs I like less than the others. So, take that as you will. ",

But any time I see the show or listen to the various recordings, I wonder why this number wasn\u2019t cut from a show that is already very long and how it survived all efforts to cut the runtime down (which lost some other bits I generally like). Don\u2019t get me wrong, the song is pretty, but nothing that stands out; it also provides a new perspective on the whole revolution plot. But I feel it just stalls the show and is simply not needed. We just had the whole barricade scene, we had the sewers and Javert\u2019s suicide. And now we cut to people talking about the failed revolution instead of seeing what happened to the characters we care about? Seems redundant and actually makes me lose interest in the song every time. Removing \u201cTurning\u201d and progressing immediately to \u201cEmpty Chairs\u201d would - in my opinion - be the better option as it gets us into the last bit of the story faster. ",

Separating the songs that I don't like because I didn't like the musical in the first place,and having to pick a favorite musical? Well, let's start there. My two favorite musicals are \"Cabaret\" and \"A Chorus Line.\" I like them because they are the least contrived. I don't think there is a bad song in \"A Chorus Line.\" And I had to work to find one in \"Cabaret.\" But there's an instrumental number called \"Sitting Pretty\" that neither adds to the theme of the rise of Nazi power nor to the secondary purpose of promoting Liza Minelli's fabulous performance. It's just filler, and not even great jazz. ",

Lumiere had already had a great number with Be Our Guest, so the director may have wanted to mix it up with Mrs. Potts. Even on my first viewing of the film I felt very strongly that Lumiere would've handled that song about a thousand times better. ",
