When you are attending a baaraat and everyone near you start dancing , what will be your reaction??? When you just reached the ground and your friends are playing cricket in front of you , what will be your reaction??? When you were waiting to write your first answer in Quora and finally find the suitable question , what will be your reaction??? When you want to meet your friend but hesitate to call because you have a fear that he will be busy in his some other work but in the next minute you get a call from that friend and he asks to meet , what will be your reaction??? The answers of all these situations are same , when you enjoy to do something then you would get emotionally attached with it , that's why you would like to eat , play , dance ,answer . It's not your fault but your brain tends to relate the situation in the song with your memories or your current scenario that's why whenever you listen some kind of music then your brain tricks you.

            "answer_text": "This is a great question, and a tough one. Some great philosophers used to say that if poetry is the pen of the heart then music is the pen of the soul. So\u2026to me\u2026I do not know exactly why, but music seems to connect on different emotional levels with different people, and, I believe it allows people to experience their true feelings in a way that is very safe and private. It can also help people have a feeling of community when they like the same songs as others. I think music actually touches a place that says to the individual, that it's ok to be you. You are fine, and whatever is going on, it will be fine to. In that way music comforts and inspires, because it allows the ego to step aside for a moment, letting the rest of your being relax and become present\u2026.IMHO ",
