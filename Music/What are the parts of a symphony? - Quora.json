            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean the typical movements found in a symphony, as more or less developed by Haydn and modified through present day. It\u2019s usually (not always but often enough to generalize) a four-movement work. In a \u201cclassical-era\u201d symphony, the first movement is in \u201csonata-allegro\u201d (aka \u201csonata\u201d) form, at a relatively brisk tempo. (Look elsewhere for where this form is described). The second movement was usually a slow one, in sonata or sonatina form. The third was usually a minuet (or Landler) usually in ABA form, and the fourth was a fairly fast one in sonata or sonata-rondo form. The symphonies of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven tend to conform to this form. When Beethoven wrote his third symphony, it was much longer, on a larger scale than the previous works, yet generally used the same form. At some point a couple of modifications began to be heard: The second movement was (sometimes) the faster one, with the third being the slow, lyrical one. Good example being Mahler\u2019s first symphony, using a funeral march for the third movement. And the \u201ccyclic\u201d idea of themes from previous movements making a reappearance in the last movement was used. A couple of other changes included changing the title of the Minuet movement to \u201cScherzo\u201d, to be played much faster than the classical minuet, the occasional addition of a fifth movement, the addition of voices to the work, so-called \u201cprogrammatic\u201d elements (Symphonie Fantastique and others), etc. In general, these didn\u2019t really change the form that Haydn used, just expanded and modified it.

            "answer_text": "Classical era symphonies are generally in three or four movements using sonata form, variation form, rondo form, etc. at the composer\u2019s preference. The standard of three or four movements characterizes most symphonies but by the 20th century practices began to vary widely. There are one movement symphonies and multiple movement symphonies. The term \u201csymphony\u201d just means \u201csounding together\u201d but the form has sort of taken on a life of its own. ",
