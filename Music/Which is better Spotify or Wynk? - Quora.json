Once you buy the premium, you gotta wait for a week until their auto-recommendation algorithm kicks in and starts offering curated playlists. Love Spotify! But if you are airtel subscriber, the obvious choice would be Wynk Music. You get more bands (Spotify is currently stuck in a pickle with Warner Music- so no Linkin Park, Green Day, etc.) and a direct route to set up hello tunes. In a nutshell, its all about your preferences. ",

The Spotify mixes and recommended are also great features! I don\u2019t know too much about Wynk but Spotify hasn\u2019t disappointed me yet. ",
