            "answer_text": "Hi, Anna; What I am able to hear sounds to me that you are able to hold pitch, carry the tune (though I do not listen to Rhiannah\u2019s music), and stay in tune throughout. These are important qualities you need to develop. If you are serious about learning to sing better, at a more \u201cprofessional\u201d level, or at least a level where you can truly belt out any tune, I would suggest you take singing lessons. If you are working, set aside 20 bucks a week, go bi-weekly to a reputable teacher that comes with high recommendations. Forty bucks a lesson is not terribly expensive. And, yes, you can get lessons for less. But you want a truly good teacher, someone who really knows what is required and knows how to teach it to you. You can try out a number of teachers before you settle on one. Some give free first lessons. But, at the end of the day, keep singing! And, so you understand how this really works: for any given song, you need to find the key that best suits YOUR voice. The Rhiannah song sounded a bit low to me, for your voice. This is based solely upon what you offered. It may not be YOUR key, where you would sing the song best. A good teacher will teach you about this, changing the key to suit YOUR voice. If they don\u2019t encourage you to do that, find another teacher. Good luck! Never quit! ",

            "answer_text": "You've got definite potential. I would second what Geoffrey said. You're a little young to be singing music that sits that low, and if you really want to do something with it, a teacher never hurts. Of course, it also depends what your ultimate goal is. Meanwhile, there are things you can do. First of all, before you make a video like this or sing for an audience (not including lessons, that is), make sure to warm up your voice. You sounded much better at the end of the video than a at the beginning because your voice was starting to warm up. Second, make sure you're taking good care of yourself, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, getting exercise, all that good stuff. Third, you need to make a video of yourself singing where you're not holding a mic in front of your mouth, so you can see what you're doing while you sing. And if it's a video that you intend to be public, try to avoid touching your face during it. And then there's always my favorite go-to source, which is VoiceCouncil Magazine Check it out! ",

Or do you want to sing in Church, or perhaps professionally? If you wish to try and make money with your voice you should find a vocal coach and work with him or her. Follow her instruction and take his advice. Warning- If your feelings are easily hurt then singing professionally will be very difficult for you. Thanks for asking! ",
