            "answer_text": "There are a lot of factors dependent on the way you sound when you sing: Your ageYour experienceBreath supportBreath controlMouth opennessYour postureHow often (or recently) you\u2019ve practicedYour rangeWhat you\u2019ve eaten or drankWhether or not your breathing from your diaphragmIf you\u2019re using vibratoIf you\u2019re forcing a belt, vibrato, or specific soundsWhat you\u2019re trying to singThe reason I\u2019ve listed off all of these factors is because there is a very real chance that they may be affecting your vocal quality. For example, if you\u2019re 10\u201312 years old (or under), your vocal chords will not yet be fully matured, and can hinder your performance. Are your notes flat? Or is there little to no vibrato? What you can do Drop your jawPretend like there are marbles in your mouthMake sure you\u2019re standing upright with correct posture. Don\u2019t slouch, keep your head up and shoulders backAlways warm up! Practice singing for 15 minutes each dayIf you get a teacher they\u2019ll help you with warm ups when they find your range.Breathe from your diaphragm (this helps with breath control/support)You\u2019ll know you\u2019re breathing from there if you place a book on top of your belly and can move the book up and downWhen you sing from your diaphragm, your shoulders won\u2019t move up and downDon\u2019t force yourself to sing a certain way (don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find your style eventually)I would also avoid belting until your develop more breath control. Belting can be dangerous for beginners, it can cause nodgules, and permanent damage to the vocal chordsFinding your range will help you avoid injuring your vocal chordsThere are some tutorials online, but I don\u2019t recommend them. You\u2019ll need an outside, professionally trained perspective to help you understand your rangeAvoid eating or drinking dairy, soda, alcohol, or anything with caffeine before singing. Stick to lukewarm, or hot drinks like herbal tea with honey or just hot water with honey.Things to think about Get a singing teacher, especially if you\u2019re a beginner. It\u2019ll be hard to know what\u2019s what if you\u2019re learning off the internet from teachers who can\u2019t immediately guide you.Alternatively, you could join a choir; however, the teachers don\u2019t always sort their students into the correct groupsIf you know any experienced singers, they can also help you practice",

I noticed an enormous change after practising daily for over a year. His program is not cheap, but you get a lot with that money and it really works if you do the exercises frequently. I wish I had discovered Ken\u2019s program years ago :/ If you are on a budget, Kevin Richards Rock the Stage NYC has some really good vocal warmups and other tips that should get you started straight away. Always sing songs as well, don\u2019t just do the warm ups and exercises. ",

I'd recommend to practice less until you have some solid foundation. Otherwise you are reinforcing bad habits, unhealthy vocal technique, and possible stress and distress to your voice. Practice smartly. As I tell my students, young & old, intelligent singing! ",
