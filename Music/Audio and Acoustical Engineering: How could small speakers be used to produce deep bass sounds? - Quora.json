            "answer_text": "Hi there. This might sound like a very basic answer, so I apologize if it doesn't quite hit the bulls-eye to this question. The reasons why smaller speakers don't have a good Low Frequency response can be a mix of some of the following explanations:  1) Low Frequencies are produced but to be heard by a human ear have to have a minimum magnitude (Further: Fletcher-Munson Curves),2) Smaller speakers (Direct Speakers) are physically incapable of pushing the volume of air that allow lower frequencies to be reproduced at the magnitude they should be. 3) The lower the frequency the longer the wavelength i.e. the more space it needs before it completes atleast one cycle at which point it can be heard as a vibrating band of air. Most speakers we find are direct speakers - which are by-far the most inefficient type of speaker possible. In most commercial hi-fi audio systems, the speaker sizes are moderate (still smaller than the golden sizes of 10\", and 12\" cones for guitar amps etc), yet a fairly balanced low end is reproduced - this is because commercial audio manufacturers traditionally adopt indirect speakers using techniques like Horn-loading and reflex ports. Reflex ports are probably best done by the manufacturers due to trouble with phase alignment, material and mathematics - but can be a good step forward - but not to say its not been done before, and the results aren't nearly there yet.  Using something like horn-loading can be a way of hacking the phone/laptop's speakers to help with Lower frequency - but this would automatically have limitations with size and bulkiness to the construct given the trade-off of how low it can go. Imagine two horns sitting on each speaker of your laptop - making it look like a modern gramophone player, not to mention also obstructing your screen a good deal I reckon. Not to guarantee this will revive the dead lower end completely. And then adding on, there's always trouble with the materials, leakages, damping, etc...  Thats to my knowledge so far. Hope this helps.. Here are some pictures of horn-loading for a good low end on a fairly normal sized (probably a 2 - 4\" woofer cone)... just to give you an idea of how horn-loading never ceases to end in possibilities.      notice the bigger white cone at the very back - the whole white wall more or less.

            "answer_text": "There are a few \u201ctricks\u201d that are used to \u201cpush things\u201d a bit further. But this is done with a series of Compromises. Loudspeakers convert electrical signals into mechanical motion. This motion will cause air molecules in front and to the back of it to vibrate. Rather than simply pushing the molecules out of the way, a wave is created. This wave influences each little area of air molecules as it passes through. As the sound wave \u201cmoves\u201d, first the air molecules are pressed tighter together (compression) and then pulled farther apart (rarefaction). The alternating high and low pressure will move the eardrum, and we perceive this oscillation as sound.  You can not dramatically increase the size of the cone of loudspeaker drivers, without having to increase the cabinet size you will need, in order to get the most out of the driver, or to fit it in. But you can create a smaller loudspeaker with a longer throw.  In a loudspeaker long throw refers to the ability of a speaker cone to travel long distances \u201cin and out\u201d, ideally without encountering nonlinearities in its response. It is difficult to make a single speaker that can reproduce all frequencies equally well. Therefore some compromises are taken when building a small full range driver that will respond \u201cwell\u201d to lower frequencies. It will do it in determent to the other frequencies.  So these small speakers when, and, if measured, are not as amazing in their response, as you assume or perceive they are. To the average listener they may \u201csound\u201d great but that is not entirely true. If compared with true Higher Fidelity loudspeakers they actually sound,\u2026well,\u2026 not so good at all. There is a lot of information missing, and the mids and highs will \u201csuffer\u201d a lot in the overall presentation. This is not a \u201cnew technology\u201d it is almost like creating a woofer that \u201ccan\u201d respond to a wider range of frequencies. A good full range does not usually have a long throw.  In addition passive radiators can also be used.  There are plenty of \u201csolutions\u201d with passive radiators and they are also not a \u201cnew technology\u201d A passive radiator is a speaker without the magnet, and electronic structure attached to it. A passive radiator speaker is a simple device used to increase the low frequency response (Bass) of a speaker system. When used properly, a passive radiator can give a speaker system the comparable performance characteristics of a larger system. They are used where there is not enough space for a port or vent system.  After the development of the Ice Power amplifier from Bang & Olufsen several related or derived technologies for amplification have been created. Some with greater or lesser quality or success, but the physical size of the amplifier needed to reach a certain amount of power can be considerably reduced.  Another \u201ctrick\u201d is the use of software at the preamplifier stage that can enhance the response of a given or a particular range of frequencies. It has long been realised that auditory perception has a complex relationship to the sound that causes it and the discipline of psychoacoustics has established a body of knowledge explaining this relationship. More recently, audio system designers have been utilising these findings to maximise the performance of their systems. The techniques of perceptual coding have been developed to focus on designing systems for the way we hear, and allow the balance of efficiency and quality to be maximised.  Examples of successful implementations are the MPEG audio compression system, the Dolby AC-3 home theatre system and MaxxBass, a signal processing technology that, powerfully exploits psychoacoustic phenomena to recreate the sensation of low frequency sound without the necessity of covering the whole low frequency range. Essentially, it is a patented audio signal processing algorithm expressed in analogue or digital form. Correctly implemented it can extend the apparent low range of the loudspeaker by up to one and a half octaves with no loss of efficiency, no increase in power input and no increase in size. To understand how this is achieved it is best to briefly outline some theory. MaxxBass exploits the psychoacoustic phenomenon of the \u2018missing fundamental\u2019. This phenomenon involves the pitch perception of complex tones. Investigating the auditory perception of combination tones, Schouten showed that complex periodic sounds with no energy at the fundamental may still give a clear pitch sensation at the fundamental. This would indicate that low pitches may be perceived via those neural channels that normally respond to the high or middle frequency components of a signal.  In the end your brain is just being tricked. This makes you belie you are listening to a great audio performance from the speaker, when, in fact, that is not usually the case.  Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology which deals with all kinds of human perceptions.

            "answer_text": "If you put many small speakers together in an array you can theoretically displace the required amount of air to achieve good low frequency response. The problem is controlling each individual speaker so that it contributes and not detracts from the sound. If you use junk speakers you will get a poor result. Use high quality products and you could get a great result. So building this array will be wonderful yes? Except having to use all those small expensive drivers, constructing a special cabinet, wire it all up and heavy duty amp\u2026 Wait, why not just use one or two large speakers and a smaller cabinet and a normal amp? Well if you have your heart set on small speakers then you have to come up with a more ingenious way to do this. Several decades ago Keith O Johnson built a custom three - 5 inch driver RF servo-driven subwoofer using (I think it was 5 inch) super long throw voice coils. And it was a room shaking speaker. Point being low frequency sound needs a lot of air displacement to work by what ever means possible and he did it. Today the technology has moved on and now we have MEMs (Micro ElectroMechnical Systems) speaker arrays. So be prepared to come full circle with \u201cThe Wall of Sound\u201d again very soon. Think tiny subwoofers the size of your cell phone. We shall see. ",

Here we have done it to compete even several lakh costing systems! The best systems as suggested here or advertised or commonly reviewed on digital media websites ranking sites, e commerce or online shopping sites are mostly untrustable due to fake reviews or purple connecting too good or too bad about speaker systems without having sufficient understanding about the engineering and how to interpret audio towards music listening experience, movie theater experience, etc. Moreover, the high end and luxury systems costing over a lakh has to include additional showroom related operational costs and marketing cost to manage the cost to the company! They still cannot fine tune every piece and every specs as they have to manufacture bulk stock for entire operating countries' locations.. So we considered all of this and spent years to create handmade excellence that matches and even overdo most speakers from 30K to 4 crore with ranges from different brands! I hope the music part of it had been explained to my best in simpler terms, but how we could do the cost part, No employees except handmade cabinet maker and me as a marketing director. Founder and CEO of the company runs the entire show who is playing a significant role for the excellent delivery of his passion for music. Even musicians are impressed to know about our speakers and experience our speakers. So far 9 out to10 who listened have purchased without turning back to compare any to brands available in india may it be imported models as well. If you are an audiophile or expecting great music experience or home theatre experience, then do reach out to us, let us share relationship in our audio experience not just a seller buyer medium.

In basic, the fundamental frequency of low frequencies said small speaker CAN produce is measured. Then it produces multiples of the fundamental near to the lower frequency that the listener wants to interpret as bass and your ear/brain thus 'hears' low bass. But you are not actually hearing it, your brain is simply making up the missing frequency because it is hearing a partial frequency that belongs to that bass frequency, so your brain decides \u201chey, bass!\u201d and so it duly processes it. An everyday example would be when you talk to people on the phone, they still sound the way they do in person. A person with a deep gruff voice will still sound the same despite the fact the tiny speaker in your phone couldn't possibly be reproducing those frequencies. Your brain makes the rest up. Sorry I couldn't give a more technical explanation. Its been years since I was at University. ",

            "answer_text": "If by small you mean in terms of radiating surface of the driver, there are two basic ways to produce more low frequency acoustic energy. One is to increase the excursion of the surface, that is the forward and backward distance the surface can move. The other is to increase the number of drivers, so that the total effective radiating surface area is increased. Of course these strategies can be combined. There are also enclosure design techniques that take advantage of the resonance of the air mass inside the enclosure. These can be tuned to increase the effective power radiated in a selected frequency range. In general however it\u2019s at the expense of power outside that range, so the total power capacity isn\u2019t necessarily increased. And as some previous answers have pointed out, horn loading can potentially improve the efficiency of energy transfer. ",

Bose does this a lot. It makes the sound innacurate, but more impressive. But if you actually test these little speakers, you will find that while that little speaker is doing all it can do, making use of all of the technology possible to make it sound as good as it can be, its still a small speaker with major limitations, and will not compare with a larger, similarly well designed speaker.

DSP control allows the driver to be pushed to its limit, but not beyond, so the \"safety mechanisms\" can be removed without fear of distortion / damage.  As you turn up the volume on these small speakers, multiband compression is used to limit the lowest frequencies - since they require the most excursion - without compressing the rest of the audio band.  Watch a Harman engineer explain it here (but don't listen to the interviewer, he really doesn't understand what he's saying):   Another technique commonly employed for squeezing low bass out of a small box is pairing an active driver with one or more Passive radiator (speaker) ",
