            "answer_text": "50/50 It might have slightly violence, because the players can hit others and polices use guns. I would say it depends on the age of child, but if the child itself don\u2019t see any problem then it\u2019s fine to play it. The game is kinda annoying as well, because when cops gets a player by using cuffs, you will go to jail again and escape again from there and there are cops who camp the jail, that cannot even leave the building, but i haven\u2019t played the game in a year, so idk how much it has changed. It\u2019s not that bad in the end, though. Just little hitting others and game includes stealing which i do not want them to copy of. One of the most popular among boys, even though girls also play it. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. So i used to play jailbreak (i don\u2019t now cause i don\u2019t like it) and it was a fine game, pretty good. BUT is it child friendly. It kinda is unless you count guns, fights, bodies etc. I was young when i played jailbreak my mom didn\u2019t approve (lol) but i still played and she got off my back. So it just depends on how you raise a child. If you don\u2019t like guns and violent, not real avatars maybe you shouldn\u2019t let them play but if you believe that they wont get affected by the game, let them play. ",
