            "answer_text": "Ah, yes, the overuse of \u201cliterally.\u201d I highly doubt that literally everyone has pirated music, especially given the fact in some countries they have issues keeping electricity on, let alone computers. The entertainment industry as a whole is always changing, usually because of new technologies. When VCR\u2019s first came out (or even Beta for that matter) it was painted that it would ruin the industry because people would just copy tapes. The obvious flaw in that argument is the original product has to be bought first. When I was in middle school and high school, person to person (also called peer to peer) file sharing programs like Napster and Kazaa allowed anyone with an internet connection to share files on the program\u2019s network. It wasn\u2019t just music, it was movies, literature, even software. Napster was punished by the industry eventually, head on a stick style. The judgement against Napster was simple: copyright infringement. The entertainment industry still made money and all, but the core issue is going against intellectual property rights. The argument that the industry still makes money so pirating is OK is ancillary. Of course media pirating isn\u2019t going to really hurt the entertainment industry. In the music arena, for example, there are more revenue sources than compact disk and digital sales. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we should completely abandon intellectual property rights, or halt the implementation of those laws for the entertainment industry. If we stopped enforcing intellectual copyright laws for a certain industry, that isn\u2019t equality under the law. Finally when we talk about \u201can industry\u201d we\u2019re really talking about people, from the artist themselves to the studio janitor. To me this question is dehumanizing those involved in creating music, and that helps to see the industry in a very sanitized and mechanical way. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you present an argument based on a fact, you really should verify that your \u201cfact\u201d is actually fact. First off, it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE for \u201cliterally everyone on earth\u201d to pirate music, since there are billions of people around the world (probably a bit of an exaggeration, but there really are a lot of people) who don\u2019t have access to computers or the Internet, so there\u2019s no way they could download/pirate anything at all. Second, just because you (or someone you know) does something, that does not automatically mean that everyone else does it. There are many (but not as many as there should be) people who would never steal anything. Third, while piracy does result in some loss of revenue for the owner/provider of the content, digital and physical music sales are only a very tiny part of the total profits for the music industry. The vast majority comes from live concert tickets, radio/TV/streaming license fees, and sometimes license fees for other artists to use the copyrighted content. ",
