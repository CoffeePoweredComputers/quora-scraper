            "answer_text": "I gave this quite a lot of thought following its release in 2008, and in interviews the band have been rather ambiguous about it too. However, upon listening to the lyric I have developed my own hypothesis about the narrative. I should add that this is my own opinion and founded only on my own interpretation. I\u2019ll break down my interpretation first and hopefully that will help to show how I have reached my conclusion. \u201cI used to rule the worldSeas would rise when I gave the word (I considered myself to be omnipotent) Now in the morning, I sleep aloneSweep the streets I used to own (I am no longer the leader, and have returned to being an \u2018everyday\u2019 citizen) I used to roll the diceFeel the fear in my enemy's eyes (I took chances and bluffed my opponents, bullying them to get my way. Listen as the crowd would singNow the old king is dead! Long live the king! (I was held in reverence by my citizens.) One minute I held the keyNext the walls were closed on meAnd I discovered that my castles standUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand (Suddenly everything changed and I had been found out. I was no longer the leader and no longer trusted. My lies had been discovered. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field (People from all quarters are calling for answers and I\u2019m depending on others, people who represented my cause, to come to my defence.) For some reason I can't explainOnce you go there was never, never a honest wordAnd that was when I ruled the world (My leadership was all a lie.) It was a wicked and wild windBlew down the doors to let me inShattered windows and the sound of drumsPeople couldn't believe what I'd become (The accusations and truths about me are known and my downfall is complete. My supporters are shocked at what they hear about me.) Revolutionaries waitFor my head on a silver plateJust a puppet on a lonely stringOh, who would ever want to be king? (My opponents and former friends want me to be punished, but the truth is more complicated. My intentions had been just but I was acting at the behest of someone else. I had, in turn, been bullied and forced to tell the lies I stand accused of. My leadership had not been as omnipotent as I had made out.) I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Calvary choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world.\u201d (I will be judged again by my God - and will probably be condemned again - for my lies and deception when I had been leader.) My hypothesis: The song is about how Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, got caught up in the Bush administration\u2019s conspiracy and lies about the presence of WMD\u2019s and subsequent invasion of Iraq and then Afghanistan. Bush was the puppeteer who demanded Blair\u2019s support. Agree? Disagree? Discuss\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It's about losing everything and carrying on. The narrator was a king but lost his kingdom. Now he sweeps the roads he used to own. Despite this he's still optimistic; he feels St Peter will know him, that is, he will be on the list to get into heaven. The metaphor is that even when the worst happens you can still have hope for the future. ",
