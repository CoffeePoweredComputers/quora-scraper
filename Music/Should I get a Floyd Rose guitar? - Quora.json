            "answer_text": "No one can really answer that for you. We don\u2019t know how well versed you are with keeping these guitars in good playing condition, how your financial situation is, what sort of music you play or how you play. If dive bombing, pull up squeals and all that vibrato gymnastics is your thing, you might want to try one out. There are certain things to pay attention to though. The good FR units (the originals) are pretty expensive and there are lots of lesser quality licensed ones that can wear out rather fast and cause tuning instability. Also, if you change tuning or string gauge, or don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing when changing strings, you\u2019re in for a \u201ctreat\u201d. If you know how to set them up and maintain them, or have a guitar tech handle it for you, go right ahead. There are alternatives though. The Kahler system is a similar system to FR but it don\u2019t go out of tune with string breaks, string changes etc. like the Floyd does. You can do the same kind of bends on a Kahler but it is easier to deal with tuning wise. Your best bet is to try out both systems, talk with people experienced with using them both and perhaps other vibrato systems as well before committing to any purchase. ",

They had one a while back called a Speedloader that needed special strings\u2014a good idea IF you can get the strings, otherwise you\u2019d have a guitar-shaped doorstop! Brad Whitford of Aerosmith is using a Floyd Rose guitar, so they can\u2019t be all that bad, but I\u2019ve never played one. I had a Kramer back in the \u201980s that had a Floyd Rose vibrato on it. Changing strings was a pain, but other than that it worked fine. ",
