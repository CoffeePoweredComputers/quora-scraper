            "answer_text": " In order to make your voice stronger and improve your range try to do the following every day: Practice scales up and down very slowly with metronome set around 50 BPMThe scales should have root notes based on All 12 notes and should cover both minor and major scales - C, (C#/Db), D, (D#,Eb), E, F, (F#/Gb), G, (G#/Ab), A, (A#/Bb), B - so together you end up with 24 scales - just by doing this it will improve your voice a lotThe next thing to do is to practice intervals within those scales - start with 3rds and 4ths and once you get comfortable go to bigger intervalsWhat's very important for you is to warm up your voice before approaching those excercises otherwise you risk injuring your vocal cordsTake regular breaks and try not to practice too much everyday - set a limit on what you feel comfortable with when it comes to practicingAfter some time depending on your progress and effort try to slowly approach both your lower and upper range, first you should feel very comfortable there and only then you should try to sing lets say a semitone higher then you normally reachObviously it requires a lot of time and effort but if you are motivated and put some dedication into it over time you should improve.

            "answer_text": "Practice makes perfect. Just like any other muscle in the body, the vocal cords need to be stretched and strengthened. Do simple vocal exercises, slowly and gently stretching your range. Remember, support from your diaphragm and not your throat, so as not to damage your voice! Best of luck and I hope this helps! :)   ",
