            "answer_text": "Anything by the artist Madeon, actually everything by Madeon thats close to like edm tho-it all depends on preference. personally i like all kinda of music so i keep a variety of them: rap, classical, some Christian songs here and there (the old Charlotte Church note: the old, peace new Charlotte) Charlotte Church - Just Wave Hello (this is amazing) (thanks to you by tyler collins [something i forgot]) (always gives me chills, since it is related to my grade school graduation, good memories), video game songs (songs from runescape, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker theme song, songs from Kingdom Hearts, all of which are flipping amazeballs [i dont say that often, which means its just freaking amaazing, trust me]) are good especially if you want to hit the feels while on the road (which isnt advisable, i guess, but in the emotional side, definitely a go-go, especially better when shared with another one!) ooh ooh songs from movies like the one in Brother Bear(on my way - Brother Bear OST (again grade school graduation memories ahh) and where are you going? if youre in a more country side --definitely play (Bolt OST ((yes the disney movie about the dog; there is a particular song there, i think its in the ending if i can recall, its really country and nice) if youre entering a city like new york at night (whatta view) definitely Empire state of mind - jay Z feat Alicia Keys GLEEE REEEMIX!! (havent tried this one on land tho, but works everytime on plane (blessed, Thank You Lord) especially when you in the morning sky and on the way (tell everybody)to a mid-dawn landing in the city (my gosh, Thank You again Lord for my...what a view to witness...what a time to be a alive) you should experience that (landing in New York at dawn, right after afternoon) (i hope you will) and play  boyfriend by big time rush when you're at it) (again grade school, i had good taste as a kid)  . . well i can go on and on and mesmerize to you about them special sixth grade graduation memories of mine (sorry about that, just one of the best times of my life) i just want to give you some insight: associate good music, with good memories (take the moment make it good live it up) hopefully, with good people (if u got aleast one of those good stuff you blessed). and good views while youre at it!!   have a safe trip! safety first!! gotta be careful out there..

            "answer_text": "When it comes to driving, there is one major thing that can\u2019t be neglected which makes driving relaxing and worthwhile. It is the sound of our favorite song. Driving on the highway will be a lot of fun when you have good music to compliment it. Music influences the experienced mood while driving which in turn can affect driver\u2019s behavior. Unfortunately, not all songs are appropriate when it comes to road safety. With our observation and researches, we observed that the majority of those songs listened to by car drivers while driving causes more harm than good to them. Another study shows that the tempo for safe driving was one that mimics the human heartbeat falling within 60-80 beats per minute and the dangerous ones are those of extremely high tempo, which raises the heart rate past its natural levels. The extreme fast tempo music causes car drivers to speed up in other to keep up with the music pace which sometimes leads to a traffic violation, while extremely slow music makes people be too relaxed. It has also been discovered that it is not only the tempo of the song that can negatively influence your driving. Loud music volume is also believed to increase heart rate and reaction time. Here are the top 10 safe driving songs to listen to: Burna Boy \u2013 \u201c On the low\u201d Dare Alade -\u201cPray for me\u201d Jonny Drille \u2013 \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d Ty Bello \u2013 \u201cThe land is green\u201d Timi Dakola \u2013 \u201cThe vow\u201d Tope Alabi \u2013 \u201cYes and Amen\u201d Sunny Ade \u2013 \u201cAppreciation\u201c Jaywon \u2013 \u201cThis year\u201d Adekunle Gold \u2013 \u201cIre\u201d Drake \u2013 \u201cGod\u2019s plan\u201d If you find yourself always listening to extreme loud volume songs or getting distracted by the songs played on the radio or from your playlist, it might be time for a change.
