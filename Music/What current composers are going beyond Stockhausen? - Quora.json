            "answer_text": "Essentially the texture music (aka Soundmass, also micropolyphony) style, which originated with Ligeti, was one of the first reactions to at least some of the original things that Stockhausen is famous for (high modernist integral serialism and electronic music, etc.) although Ligeti\u2019s reactions were more tied to the parallel developments of Boulez during the same period (in the 1950s). Essentially they were trying to emulate the complex composite textures of high modernism, without requiring the virtuosity of the performers (especially since you really could not hear the individual parts.) Micropolyphony, at the same time, was an emulation of the textures that electronic music of high modernists were creating. Another composer group that perhaps, \u201cwent beyond\u201d was the music from the same period of Cage, Brown, and Feldman which instead tried to create similar atmospheres as High Modernists, but through indeterminate means (which was later refined by Sound Mass composers like Penderecki and Lutoslawski, and Italian composer Berio, but was also suggested earlier on by the music of Xenakis). The High Modernist ideas of Europe were in many ways continued/paralleled by the American academics in the following decades (perhaps referred to best as \u201cMaximalists.\u201d) By around the late 1960s, American minimalists (first by LaMonte Young, then others) searched out a reaction to this maximalism, which is a predecessor to what would later become Post-Modernism (Eclecticism, Neo-Romanticism, Cross-Over, etc.) However, another group of composers, primarily in Europe, continued Modernism to greater extremes\u2014these composers are referred to as \u201cNew Complexity,\u201d with Ferneyhough being the most famous. Finally, Europe also developed it own form of \u201cHoly Minimalism\u201d, and other unique composers like Scelsi, but most significant (perhaps the most important style of recent years) which is often called \u201cSpectralism\u201d that builds off many, if not all of the things I have mentioned here. (There is even a MORE recent development called \u201cHyper-Spectralism\u201d too.) So as you can see, Stockhausen is a very old member of the canon\u2026so much happened since. I should mention, however, Stockhausen himself did continue to compose up to the end of his life more recently, and even that developed and was influenced by concurrent trends. ",

            "answer_text": "Me. Stockhausen expanded Western music\u2019s notions of counterpoint and form to a wider range of parameters beyond pitch and rhythm often through his electronic music (i.e. he made spatial composition a thing, pioneered in quadraphonic technology and making it do many impressive things, etc.). What I aim to do is to bring what he did even further while simultaneously reincorporating the essences of music of the past, the ancient past, the now, the future and beyond, and the music of all cultures in a way that transcends culture and points toward God\u2019s eternal realm beyond temporality. This eternal perspective is the framework for how I will approach my creative decisions making and develop Western music even further. Also, Stockhausen in a sense aimed to create music that seeks to reflect the order of the cosmos, often composing works that reflect the series of astrological signs [TIERKREIS; SIRIUS], and also the basic structure of time (hours of the day [KLANG], days of the week [LICHT]). My works, instead of emphasizing the cosmos will emphasize the Logos, seeking to create music that reflects formally, aesthetically and spatially God\u2019s order revealed in His Word. Additionally, while Stockhausen was spiritual to some degree, he was more interested in entertaining new age philosophies rather than the truth of God\u2019s Word; my intention for music is to glorify God with what I create and contribute towards establishing and cultivating a strong Christ-centered counterculture in the world.
