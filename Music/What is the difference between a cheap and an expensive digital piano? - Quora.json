Several things. Better quality instruments are built more sturdily. They're heavier because they're better. They won't bust the first time they're dropped or tossed out of a van. The touch is better on a quality instrument. Cheapo keyboards have cheapo keys made of plastic. A lot of cheap keyboards have gimmicky features. Blinking lights Pro keyboards are more functional. Sound? I'm not sure there's that much difference. A digital circuit is a digital circuit. It's not much more expensive to make a quality digital circuit. ",

            "answer_text": "The same as anything else - the cheaper one will contain cheaper components, cheaper materials, the synth that generates the sounds will likely be inferior. A good keyboard is going to have weighted keys for a more piano-like feel. If it has a built in amplifier and speakers, those would also likely be inferior on the cheaper models. Depending on your needs, cheaper might be fine. If you are not a performing musician, a difference in reliability or diminished sound quality may not be an issue for you. ",
