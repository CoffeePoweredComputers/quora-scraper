            "answer_text": "I once made $2,600 within a few minutes. No, it was not a drug deal and yes, it was perfectly legal. But first, let\u2019s talk about 4 major mistakes that most people make when they ask a question like this one: They only think of \u201cinvestment\u201d in terms of \u201cmoney.\u201d EVERYBODY has assets that could be used and leveraged as investments. For example, before they became Uber drivers, their cars were not business assets. But once they join Uber, they can make money from that asset. Same with Airbnb. So get creative. Look at the assets you do have, and use/leverage them to make $$$.They only think of \u201cinvestment\u201d as \u201ctheir money\u201d (you can always get others to invest, but of course, you gotta be persuasive)They never consider past investments they made, and thus never leverage such investments (including the trust they built in their social/professional network)They try to be creative from a place of scarcity, of fear, of stress and of negativity. Nothing comes out of nothing. Something comes out of something. So a better question is, \u201cHow can I make x dollars by using my y education, my z experience, and my w skills?\u201d Abundance can only come from abundance.How many ways to make money? Infinite ways. The number is limited only by your imagination (or, more precisely, your willingness to let your imagination run WILD and give you tons and tons of ideas, which you implement, and you then keep the good ideas). I\u2019ve got hundreds of ideas, and will update this answer with them over time. But here\u2019s one: contact the prolific Quora writers, and pitch to them the idea of compiling their best answers into an ebook that you can sell on Gumroad, and you split the profits with the authors (there can be MANY authors in this ebook). Note: The $2600 was a finder\u2019s fee for connecting a buyer and seller. ",

You know most of the YouTubers start the channel, upload some videos and then quit. Why? Because they don\u2019t know what to upload next.

Once youtube start recommending your channel then you will know how much you earn. Patience is the only key to success in this field. 4.

Identify your niche \u2013 Now that you know the services you want to offer and the type of client you want to work with, you might see a niche or a theme. Your niche is basically what you specialize in. What type of VA do you want to be? Is there a specific industry you want to work in? Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t quite have a niche yet! You\u2019ll figure it out eventually!  6. As an Affiliate Marketer :Are you interested in affiliate marketing but worried that you need loads of money to get into the business? Well, we have good news for you. You can definitely get started in affiliate marketing, even if you\u2019re short on cash. There are just a few things you need to understand first. What is Affiliate Marketing All About? With affiliate marketing, you make money by promoting products and services to your audience members and referring them to the websites of retailers selling those products and services. When someone you refer purchases something or completes an action, such as signing up for a service or an email list, you earn a commission. This marketing technique benefits both the advertiser and affiliate. The affiliate gets paid while the seller makes a sale. Bloggers Use Affiliate Marketing These days many bloggers use affiliate marketing to earn money. You may have heard that some of the best bloggers out there are making as much as $40 thousand each month on affiliate sales alone. Of course, to make this kind of money, you have to have a huge, loyal audience. But what if you don\u2019t have that kind of following? Let alone a blog at all? Can you still become an affiliate? Fortunately, the answer is yes. No Money, No Worries! We want to start by saying that having a blog and website should be your ultimate goal as an affiliate marketer. It is, hands down, the best way to run a successful affiliate marketing business. However, when you\u2019re new to the business and you\u2019re on a shoestring budget (or have no budget at all) there are a few things you can do to start generating the income you\u2019ll need to eventually start your website and blog. Create a Social Media Presence Being an affiliate doesn\u2019t mean you have to become a blogger right away. Instead, you can begin monetizing your online presence through social media. You can do this by placing affiliate links within your posts, updates, and profiles. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and so on are packed with millions of users. You can easily integrate links into your posts and see results. Just make sure to follow the rules and restrictions of these sites, as you technically don\u2019t own your accounts. Be on Facebook A lot of people, in fact, billions of people, are in Facebook these days, which makes it the largest social media platform. If you have an account, you can promote affiliate products on your page. The important thing is to focus your page on a subject of interest to your audience. It could be health, money, fitness, relationships, or pretty much anything else folks are interested in learning about. Be a YouTube Star Have you ever considered starting a YouTube channel? If not, then this is the best time to do so! YouTube is an incredibly effective platform for affiliate marketing and has millions of users. The most successful YouTubers are earning millions each year just by making videos promoting products they enjoy. This is perhaps one of the best ways to become an affiliate without investing in a blog and website. Just know that you won\u2019t likely have very many subscribers in your first few months, but if you keep posting interesting and useful videos, you\u2019ll eventually build the audience you need to succeed. Join an Affiliate Program Once you\u2019ve established your following on social media or YouTube, you can begin to apply for affiliate network programs like ShareASale and Rakuten. These programs are constantly seeking publishers who can promote well. However, to join these programs, you\u2019ll need to qualify, and that usually means having a solid online presence and following. So it\u2019s important that you have quality content to be considered a good source. What Should You Do Then?  If you\u2019ve set your mind on becoming an affiliate, there\u2019s no way to go but up. And if you\u2019re truly determined, you should always approach your work with the best practices and strategies in mind. Building an audience is critical, as well, so follow the rules of the trade. And when you do become a good source of information, expect people to recommend the products you write about. Your opinion will become gold in the end. So to answer the question, can you do affiliate marketing without money? The answer is a resounding yes! It just takes time, patience, opportunity, and determination; the rest is history. It\u2019s never too late to start! ",

            "answer_text": "Basically everyone one here will probably recommend stuff like surveys that'll make you a couple of dollars per hour. Realistically, you\u2019ll need at least a little start up capital to earn real money. My favorite way to make money online with relatively low startup costs is re-skinning apps. You can get started with $50 - $150. Last year I was able to make over $15,000 working just 1 hour per week and this past January I was able to make $6,199 working just 2\u20133 hours per week. If you think $50 - $150 is a lot, just think about the profits you can make. The investment could make you over $2,000 in just a couple of weeks! Re-skinning apps is a pretty simple process. Basically, you purchase/create a template, change the graphics of the template, and then sell the app. The entire process will take between 1 and 3 hours depending on your experience. After having re-skinned apps for over a year now, I\u2019ve found that the typical re-skinned app sells for between $100 and $300. However, I\u2019ve had single re-skins that have sold for over $2,000! If re-skinning sounds like something you want to try, I would first recommend looking at Chupamobile. Chupamobile is a marketplace to buy app templates. They usually cost between $50 and $250. However, once you buy a template once, you can re-skin it an unlimited amount of times! After you decided on your first template, you\u2019re going to need to re-skin the app. I\u2019ve found that simplicity is the best when re-skinning apps. I typically just change the icon, colors, screenshots, text, and backgrounds of the app. I wouldn\u2019t try to add features because this is time consuming and the return isn\u2019t usually that great. After completing the re-skin, you\u2019re almost finished with your first app! Now you just have to sell it on Flippa, a marketplace for buying and selling apps and websites. If this sounds like a good way to make money for you, you should definitely check out my YouTube Channel to see in-depth videos on how to re-skin apps efficiently. Also, join my Facebook Group so you can talk with other beginner re-skinners and learn from the experts too! I believe that somebody taking re-skinning apps seriously could make six figures in a year. I really recommend staying away from \u201cfree\u201d online businesses because they won\u2019t help you in the long run. I hope you can give re-skinning apps a try because I think its really a great way to start making money on a tight budget! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi am glad you asked me this question in the proper way and will l share with you a perfect answer that if you take action your first $200 could be on its way to you before people start recommending things that won't help your situation at all  When a lot of people talk about how to make money they practically say things that won\u2019t be easily applicable for a beginner with zero skills or someone with no money yet they will claim it\u2019s for a beginner. Even people who have skills and money still lose money trying it out as it requires a lot of learning process except you find someone successful in that journey who is willing to show you how to do it and heck Nope they will charge you real $$$ for consultation or sell expensive courses to automate the process at $500 upward I have even seen course at $20,000 tell me how does all these help a beginner with no money. Some will recommend a bunch of useless things that just won\u2019t work out of the box for you or something that will require to build a website, start blogging and start looking or paying for traffic as long as it will help them earn they don\u2019t actually care if you get result or not and that is the greatest crime humans commit against each other the law doesn\u2019t recognize. Ain't you tired of seeing the same recommendation again and again in fact a lot of this people who give this answers copy and paste and thereby they are killing what Quora is to actually stand for because you can also get those impractical answers from google searches and waste your time or money trying to figure it out only to keep coming back typing the same thing with several words hoping to get something that will work out of the box like a WordPress plugin The real question should be is there really a way to make money online without spending any money at all? As a beginner who is trying to make money online you need something that will yield you instant result and that is what a lot of people who recommend how to make money online miss out in fact some of them are busy promoting their own programs that will make them money if you fall into their Gimmick which is totally wrong and Inhuman to me. My honest answer is yes there is and I am going to be showing you that way right here in the next few minutes. What does it involve 1. It involved no skills or technicality 2. Costs you zero expense to start 3. Nope you don\u2019t need a website 4. You don\u2019t need to promote a product or services 5. People don\u2019t need to buy anything before you get paid (not affiliate marketing) 6. They don\u2019t need to click on ads to earn you revenue 7. No this is not CPA that cheat people who promote them thinking they can earn real money 8. You don\u2019t need to take a survey or do any time-wasting task for little cents 9. and in fact, you don\u2019t need to pay for single traffic it to make or learn SEO Now so what is it I want to share with you If you are still reading, then that means you are actually ready to make money with zero capital and I will show you just how and it also means you have what is actually needed to make this work for you Determination. And if along the line you saw a green light and decided to give this a try you've made a great decision doing so. How does it work? You will only make money giving out free things to people and tell me who doesn\u2019t like free things especially if it\u2019s something they are looking for or think sounds nice to grab It is very sustainable and each effort you put starts compounding in fact you will start getting results within $24 hours to boost your morale even if you are lazy I guarantee you will make nothing less than $20 on your first day. With you reading this you pretty much already have money in your bank. Why? Because in the next few minutes, I will show you EXACTLY how to make between $200 - $500 (or more) within 24 hours easily. This can be repeated over and over again as many times as you want.

            "answer_text": "Making Money Online Without Any Product Of Your Own 1. Make Money Online Blogging  Now here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re NOT going to get PAID for simply blogging. You won\u2019t get magical internet money for simply throwing up a blog post \u2013 BUT you can use your blog traffic to sell advertising, or even to drive sales to different products that pay you a commission for sending them the sale (this is what I do with my websites). Before you get too excited and throw up the first blog you can think of, you need to learn what to make your blog about, and what specific topics people are SEARCHING FOR that you should be blogging about. 2) Traffic: A successful Youtube affiliate marketer must attract the right kind of traffic and preferably, lots of it. You have to collaborate with other Youtubers with a lot of subscribers. Remember that people with a lot of subscribers are picky about whom they choose to associate with. So you need to offer a compelling proposition. For example: Say that you have a cooking channel and they have a fitness channel. You can create a series titled Easy 5-minute Recipes for Fitness Freaks. This way, you can get lots of subs within a matter of days. You get the idea. 3) Learn how to get the click: Your titles and thumbnails will decide whether or not people click on your videos. So optimize them and make them irresistible. (Bonus points, create a custom Youtube thumbnail using Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software, or any of the other free graphics tools out there) 4) Post consistently: Some of the fastest growing channels post very often. You should seriously consider posting at least 3 videos a week during the initial phase. Sure, you may already have a job and other commitments. Just record a lot of material on weekends and spend some time each day editing and uploading content. Many new people make the mistake of uploading just one or two videos to test the waters. The problem is that if people like your content and want to watch more, you have none of it available. So upload at least 5 videos initially. If you fail to upload on a fairly consistent basis, your subs and views will drop and the competition will eat into your portion of the pie. Share your experiences with the product or service that you are promoting. Don\u2019t forget to tell people about the links in the description. ",

Read below: First incredible story: \"Once upon a time there was a Jew selling marble, and since he didn't have employees or the capital to pay for them, then every time he got into a taxi, he told them\" Do you want to earn extra money while working on yours? \", every time you pass near a construction, write down the address and number, and I will personally approach there, and if the sale turns out, then you earn a commission for the result. \"Moral of the first Story: Everything is possible when you are only able to work with systems that work for you, in this case, commission sales.Second incredible story: \"Imagine you are a poor miner, one day he digs with his hands and finds a gold nugget, you are very hungry, but instead of spending on food, you buy a shovel and keep digging until you find several pips, then you realize that you are tired of walking daily to the place where you are digging and you want to buy a bicycle, but instead you buy an excavator, you continue digging and you find more and more pips, now you want to buy a house, but instead, you invest in a team of excavators and more equipment, then continue digging until they find a gold mine, then you can buy the food, the car, the house, and everything you want. \"Moral of the second Story: The thought of this miner is to invest the little, until he gets the much. \"Rodolfo Boscan Thank you very much for your positive vote! \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most frequently asked questions by my readers is \u201chow can I make money online fast and easy without investment?\u201d For this reason, I spend time every day looking for legitimate online jobs. Most of the jobs are in the following categories: reservations agent, writing, transcriptionist, teacher, proofreader, data entry, customer service, virtual assistant, captcha entry, and resume writer. Of course, no one wants to spend money or pay registration fees to find a legitimate online job, that\u2019s why I use Pinterest. You will find boards that contain hundreds of ways to make money online and they are updated frequently! There are full and part-time jobs on these boards as well as jobs that offer benefits. Many jobs don\u2019t require any previous experience to get started. Working For Yourself Some great options for people who prefer to work for themselves is affiliate marketing or selling products.  WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING? It\u2019s when you recommend a product or service that you believe in, to your readers or followers, and they make a purchase through your links or referral codes, and you earn a commission. You get to tell people about something that you love, and that has helped you, and recommend it to others. Everyone wins! Your readers find a great new product or service, and it doesn\u2019t cost them anything extra. Sometimes they can even get a coupon or discount through your recommendation. How great is that! HOW DO I EARN AFFILIATE COMMISSIONS? There are three different ways to earn income from an affiliate. Percentage: You receive a percentage of the sale of a product. Before you join any affiliate program, you will be told what percentage you will earn. The amount can range from around 4% to 50%, depending on the product or service. Commission Per Lead: This is when you get a fixed amount for providing a customer with a new lead, such as signing up for an account. This amount can range from a few cents to a few dollars per lead. Fixed Amount: This is a set commission that you receive regardless of the price of the product or service. DO I NEED A LOT OF READERS OR FOLLOWERS TO MAKE MONEY? You don\u2019t need millions of people reading your blog each month to earn income. But to increase your income, you will need to keep your blog growing. When you understand what your readers are looking for and how to find affiliate programs, you should be able to make money from your site. There is so much to learn about blogging and marketing. Trends and technology change quickly and sometimes it\u2019s hard to find current information. If you want to learn more, I suggest taking an online class on affiliate marketing. CREATE YOUR OWN ONLINE CLOTHING STORE Thanks to online store builders, it\u2019s now easier than ever to create your own shop online \u2013 and start selling within minutes! WHAT BRAND OF CLOTHING SELLS BEST Now that you know where to sell your clothes, your probably wondering what you should sell. Look at sites like eBay and Poshmark to see what brands are in demand. Remember that top brands aren\u2019t guaranteed to sell, so use your best judgment. According to an eBay top seller, these are some of the best selling brands: J CrewNorth FaceLululemonHOW TO PRICE YOUR CLOTHING A good rule of thumb to consider when you sell clothes for cash is that you typically set the price at about one-third of the original retail price. If you bought the clothing at a second-hand store, or you don\u2019t remember what you paid for it, you could look it up online. eBay and Poshmark are good sites to visit when trying to decide how to price an item. When determining a price, you want to look at items that are already sold on eBay or similar sites. Summary There are so many options for making money online, you just have to pick the one that works best for you. ",

Like any business venture, your online income takes time to grow.

If you\u2019re angling to earn money online but aren\u2019t sure where to start, here are top 10 ways to earn online - #1) Google Adsense If you\u2019ve visited any website, you\u2019ve seen Google ads. These ads are everywhere, and for good reason. Not only are they easy to set up on any basic website, but they can be lucrative once your website starts bringing in a steady amount of traffic.

To get the credit, one needs to disclose certain information to them including one's banking details. This is why you should use this route with utmost care. Some of them may even ask you to register with them before working on projects. The most important watch out in such projects is to stay away from websites offering money that appears too good to be true. Be careful while evaluating the reputation of the website as many of them could be a scam.

If you have passion for almost anything, and you have some creative skill then you may be able to build an online income stream \u2014 or several \u2014 if you give it enough time.

            "answer_text": "Hello everyone! Going through the answers above, everyone has covered all the basics. You can read all about Freelancing, Digital Marketing, Data Entry, Blogging, and other such jobs. You already know about these jobs as well. So, in my answer, I\u2019m not going to talk about all of those. You can definitely read them in the other answers and they are well written too! I want to tell you about a great way that I\u2019ve learned how to earn money online without investment and I\u2019ve even created a whole business from it. So, that is now my primary source of earning. I want to talk about Online Reselling. Online reselling is a great way for you to sell something without having to worry about the traditional problems associated with selling such as a store, inventory, shipping, logistics, etc. In online shopping, you basically sign up with some online reselling app such as Meesho, Shop101, Glowroad, etc. Now, these apps have inventory and stock. You go through their products and select catalogs of things you think your friends and family might like. Add a small margin to the cost shown on the app, next send these catalogs to your family and friends and make them your customers. Each time a product is sold, you get to keep the extra margin, and the best part you get to decide the margin that you make! Each of these apps also offers benefits like referring and earn or bonuses for making sales, so you can make extra on your margins. I started online reselling last year when I was looking for a second income, but since then I\u2019ve started earning enough money that I\u2019ve created this into my primary source of income and I also have a lot of time to spend with family. So, I think this is one of the best ways that you earn money online without investment. Thank you For reading my answer! ",

            "answer_text": "Make Money Online in 2019 As we enter 2019, many people are thinking, what is the best way to make money online in 2019? Some of these methods are similar to previous years and there are some new ones that would surprise you.  A few of these have not yet hit the \u201cmainstream\u201d so now is probably the best time to get in and claim your share before it gets overcrowded.  1) Get Paid to Test Apps Every day, there are thousands of apps hitting the app store. From games to emoji apps these programs are flooding the market.  A little-known fact is that these companies need to test the app before it hits the app store (or play store). These companies have spent thousands of dollars building this app and they need to make sure that when people try it there are no bugs or problems.  To do this, they pay people to test the apps for them. You can make money using your smartphone or tablet by testing apps.  All you need to do is pick an app you want to test, play with it on your phone for 10-15 min, then write a review for the company so they know what to improve on.   2) Become a Social Media Manager This is one of my favorite. Companies are now coming to the realization that social media is the marketing of the future and that there is a lot of money to be made.  They are now scrambling to grow their social media pages and they are doing it by hiring people like me and you.  They will give you a task like; post on Instagram twice a day, then they pay you. That simple! The pay is anywhere from $60-$150 per week.  May not sound like too much but combine 7-10 companies and you can start making some serious cash. I have friends that were able to quit their full-time job and start doing this full time.  There are even services where companies can sign up and look for people like you. You just register with a site. Select the job you would like to apply for, then get started!Make Money Online in 2019  Here is an example of a dashboard. The gray \u201cApply\u201d buttons are ones you have already applied for. Every day hundreds of new jobs are added to your dashboard.  This is definitely one of my favorite ways to make money online in 2019.Make Money Online in 2019 Click Here to Try it Out  3) Paid Online Surveys Paid surveys were popular in 2014 and have started to die out. This forces companies to pay us more for filling out surveys.  Paid Online surveys have gotten a bad reputation in the best. This is mostly due to some of the crappy survey providers that simply don\u2019t play their members enough per survey.  The trick is to find a solid survey provider that will pay you well. You also need a survey provider that has a large supply of surveys so that you don\u2019t have to worry about running out!  I personally use Gold Opinions they always have way more surveys than you can possibly do and they add more every day!  Paid online surveys is probably the easiest way to make money online in 2019.  4) Get Paid to take Pictures with your Smartphone I don\u2019t know about you guys but I\u2019m known in my group of friends as the guy that takes the best pictures. I always know how to get the right angles and the right lighting.  If you\u2019re also like that, then you can make some pretty solid money online taking pictures with your phone.  More and more companies out there are paying people for their photos. All the stock photos you see on Apple, Microsoft, and Google were bought from people like me and you.  Even random websites on the internet need to buy photos.  You can get anywhere come $0.15-$2.00 per photos. Some mornings when the weather is nice, I\u2019ll take my phone and go around the city and take pictures.  By the time I get home, I\u2019ll have about 200 pictures. I\u2019ll upload those pictures to Photography Jobs Online and usually about half of them will get bought by companies around the world.  Some days I\u2019ll make $50-$75 before noon!   5) Micro Investing This one is very different than the others. Micro Investing is a type of investment that allows you to invest small amounts of money.  Most brokerage if you told them you only wanted to invest $30 they would laugh you out of their offices. But with micro investing, you can now invest any amount you would like into the stock market.  There is a specific Micro Investing App out there that has treated me very well called Acorns. Acorns is different from other micro investing apps in that it has a feature called roundups. Roundups is a feature that automatically invests your change for you.  For example, you just went to Starbucks and bought a coffee for $2.71. Acorns would automatically round up you purchase to $3 and invest the $0.29 in your investment account.  This may not sound like a lot but it really starts to add up over the long run.   My advice is just set it up and forget about it. Then check it a few months later and find money in your investment account you did not even notice.  If you too want to have clear any CISSP Certification in a single attempt, you would need to join the CISSPTOP, they will provide you the best help regarding CISSP Certification that you long for. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, you can\u2019t earn money online without an investment. Because even if you don\u2019t put money to invest, you still invest your \u201ctime\u201d. Anyway, if you mean, what are the ways to earn money online without spending money, the answer is as follows. Making money online largely depends on your skill level and interests as well as the time you\u2019re willing to put in. Here are some of the ways you can make money online: Freelance - you can be a freelancer (doesn\u2019t mean only writing) and apply for various jobs in the area that you\u2019re good at. Whether it be webdesign, writing, logo design, anything. There are a lot of jobs but the downside is there are a lot of applicants as well. Because of the volume of low bids, you may not get paid for what you\u2019re worth. However, the more you do freelance work, the more your job portfolio would expand and you can eventually increase your rate. Go to upwork.com or freelancer.com to subscribe for free and apply/search for jobs that would suit you. You can also search for jobs at craigslist.com.Tutor - any profession can tutor. And because of the internet, we can connect to the whole world. If you\u2019re good at what you do and feel you can share your knowledge and expertise to other people who would need extra help in the subject, by all means, tutor them online.Trade stocks - this all depends on the risk you\u2019re willing to take and how you analyse the trend of the market. This is a good way to invest your money for a long-term period.Online business - you can again utilise the power of the internet and setup your own online business dedicated to the specific skill set that you have.Affiliate marketing - you can help other fishermen catch small fishes by leading them to the websites.Answer paid surveys - from memory, I think I personally saved $400 worth of groceries from gift cards I got from answering paid surveys. If you have a minute or two to spare online everyday, this would be worth a shot. Just make sure you find a paying survey website though. Mine is valuedopinions (australia) so not sure if it would be applicable to you.Buy and sell things - this is a classic way of making money. You can buy things on clearance sale for half the price and sell them for profit. The same thing can be done with second hand items. Buy those you think you can restore without spending too much and sell them for a good price. I\u2019ve read many success stories of people who\u2019ve gotten really rich being a \u201cflipper\u201d.Hope this helps. This information is taken from the book The 10-Step Strategy to Financial Freedom: A Millennial\u2019s Guide to Money Management. It tackles everything you would need to sort out your money including personal finance, making money (including multiplying your source of income), budgeting, saving, investing, and retirement. ",

            "answer_text": " The best way to make money online without a big investment is 100% affiliate marketing. Nothing can match the low cost of entry and the earning potential, which is pretty mush limitless. When I started searching for ways to make money online I began with Amazon FBA. I was aware of affiliate marketing at the time, but I didn\u2019t understand it and so went with Amazon FBA as it was a business model that made more sense to me. You purchase merchandise in China, you brand it, you ship it to Amazon warehouse in U.S, you sell it for a profit, Simples!! There are however, a number of problems with this business. The cost of entry is not small. You have to pay for the products to be made in China.You have to pay to ship them to U.SYou have to pay Amazon a monthly sellers fee of $50You have to pay Amazon a monthly warehouse feeYou have to pay Amazon a % of every saleYou have to pay for advertising on AmazonOverall, I sent about $10,000 to get my Amazon FBA business started. I enjoyed it and did ok from it, but if I could go back in time and start again, I would 100% start with affiliate marketing. Today I\u2019ve closed my Amazon FBA business and focus 100% on affiliate marketing. The cost of entry is between $30-$100 per month. Depending on what products you promote and what tools you use. Obviously, the more money and time you\u2019re willing to invest, the faster your route to success will be, but give yourself a good 6, 9 or even 12 months to start making a lot of money from it. If you\u2019d like more details on affiliate marketing, I have a free ebook which breaks everything down step by step. This should give you a start in the right direction.

            "answer_text": "DO YOU WANT TO MAKE $30 PER DAY LIFETIME FOR CLICKING SOME SITES? Use my referral: spagrawal933 I spend my months to discover the genuine PTC site. I found that NEOBUX is most trustworthy and it is giving payments without any fail since 2008. I made a strategy to earn money from NEOBUX follow this strategy and you will definitely making money. How to Start from $0? Many sites providing chance to multiply your earning by direct referrals but we are not talking about that we will make money by Rented Referrals. What are Rented Referrals? Rented referrals are provided by Neobux itself. They are not free and if you are going to make $600+ a month from them, then you have to buy/rent referrals. One referral can be rented for $0.20 for 30 days. You have to renew each referral after 30 days. Rented referral is a vast subject. So I am going to keep it simple for the beginners here. However in next article we talk about them in great details. For now you just rent referrals from Neobux. Neobux offers them in packs and this is the cost of each pack for a member who does not have more than 250 rented referrals. Strategy for Reaching $6 Per Day from $0 You might be wondering how you are going to buy these packs because I promised you to start with $0. Well I am going to keep my promise and ready to tell you how you can start from $0 and reach up to $6 per day. It should not be hard to reach your first $0.6 in a few days or even in a few hours if you click advertisements, use AdPrize, complete Pollfish surveys and / or mini jobs. When you have $0.6 you can rent your first 3 Rented Referrals for $0.6. Congratulations! You did not spend any money from your pocket. Before we move forward I want to ask how much time does it take too reach 0.6? It is only some minutes per day! So, please do it. Each one of your rented referrals might click up to 4 orange ads per day and each click fetches $0.005. So now you can potentially make: Step 1: 3 (Rented Referrals) X 4 (ads) X $0.005 (each click) = $0.06 per day Waiting Period: 10 days so it reaches 10 X $0.06 = $0.6 Next is buying another 3 rented referrals with $0.6. Now you have 6 (3+3) rented referrals (RR). Step 2: 6 (RR) X 4 X $0.005 = $0.12 per day Waiting Period: 5 Days so it reaches 5 X $0.12 = $0.6 See the difference. Now you made $0.6 in just 5 days instead of 10 days. Now buy another 3 RR with $0.6. Your RR is 9 (3+3+3). Step 3: 9 (RR) X 4 X $0.005 = $0.18 per day Waiting Period: This time 13 days, 13 X $0.18 = $2.34 Buy 10 RRs for $2 ($0.34 is in balance). RR = 9 + 10 = 19 Step 4: 19 X 4 X $0.005 = $0.38 per day Waiting Period: 10 days, 10 X $0.38 = $3.8 $3.8 + $0.34(balance) = $4.14 Buy another 20 RR for $4 ($.14 is in balance). RR = 19 + 20 = 39 Step 5: 39 X 4 X $0.005 = $0.78 per day Waiting Period: Another 10 days, 10 X $0.78 = $7.8 $7.8 + $.14 (balance) = $7.94 Buy another 30 RR for $6 ($1.94 in balance). RR = 39 + 30 = 69 Step 6: 69 X 4 X $.005 = $1.38 per day Waiting Period: Another 10 days, 10 X $1.38 = $13.8 $13.8 + $1.94 (balance) = $15.74 Buy another 70 RR for $14 ($1.74 in balance), RR = 69 + 70 = 139 Step 7: 139 X $.005 X 4 = $2.78 per day Waiting Period: 10 days, 10 X $2.78 = $27.8 $27.8 + $1.74 (balance) = $29.54 Buy another 140 RRs for $28 ($1.54 in balance), RR = 139 + 140 = 279 Step 8: 279 X 4 X $.005 = $5.58 per day Waiting Period: This time 16 days, 16 X $5.58 = $89.28 $89.28 + $1.54 (balance) = $90.82 Finally you have 279 rented referrals and you are making $5.58 per day. You can buy another 21 referrals and make it up to 300 referrals. A standard member can have only up to 300 referrals and no more. So, a Standard Member with 300 (RRs) X 4 X0 .005 = $6 per day (if each referral clicks 4 orange ads daily). Which means 30 X $6 = $180 Per Month Let us look at this table to know how many days it took to reach 300 rented referrals and earning $6 per day. So according to this table it will take around 4 months to reach 300 referrals fetching you around $6 every day. Now you will get an idea how you are going to earn $180 per month starting with $0 dollar. You did not have to spend any money. However what you must have is patience and just 10 minutes in a day. Some Important Points Use computer to click on the adds. It doesn\u2019t work on mobile. Do not open more than one account on a single computer. If you do so they will close your both account. Some referrals do not click every day. If their average click goes below 1.333 recycle them. Use my referral: spagrawal933 ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to earn money without investment then go for Affiliate Marketing or Freelancing. Read this post until the end to understand what is Affiliate Marketing & Freelancing. Affiliate Marketing: What is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing is an option for website owners to make passive income by promoting links to products on their websites. By that, we mean you can make money even when you\u2019re not working. The concept of affiliate marketing is to leverage your content to drive sales for a website by becoming a part of the Digital Marketing Funnel of specific products or brands. A publisher can, through content directed towards a niche audience, gather views on a webpage and then promote affiliate links on it in exchange for a commission. That means a single piece of content can generate revenue for a long time. The more content and visitors you have, the bigger the chances of making money with online affiliate marketing. All sales are automatically tracked via your affiliate link code, and you get a part of the profit every time a visitor buys from your links. How does affiliate marketing work? As you can see, for online affiliate marketing to work, you must have a website or another channel where you can promote links of merchants. Used by many big brands, such as Amazon, affiliate marketing campaigns have four key players: merchants: retailers or brands that promote affiliate marketing ads;networks: which provide offers to content producers;publishers: who promote affiliate links within their content;customer: the ultimate goal for marketers.The process for building revenue this way is easy and consists of the following steps: publish content with added links to products that may interest the audience of that content;make the offers attractive to generate as many clicks and purchases as possible;every time a customer clicks on your link, they are driven to the partner\u2019s website;if your customer decides to make a purchase, you\u2019re in luck;the store will record the transaction using your unique affiliate link to calculate your commission;as soon as the transaction is confirmed, the commission will be credited to your account;in due time, you get paid for your monthly commissions and are free to start the process all over again, linking to other products on your website.Freelancing: What is freelancing? Freelancing gives you freedom. Freedom of time, location, money, and emotion. You can work any time you want. You don\u2019t have to bind yourself to a 9\u20135 job. You can work from anywhere in the world. There is no restriction. You can make as much money as you want. There is no limit. The more you work, the more you get paid. You can choose the persons you want to work with. You don\u2019t have to work with the same boss every time. From writers to web designers, TV presenters to radio producers, many people in the media industry are \u2018freelancers\u2019. A freelancer is someone who doesn\u2019t work for one company full-time but is hired by different companies for certain jobs. For example, a magazine or website will have a core team of editors who hire freelance writers to write articles, or a TV production crew might hire freelance cameramen to work on one series of programs. Advantages: Choose your work. Being a freelancer means you don\u2019t have a boss telling you what to do so you can say \u2018no\u2019 to jobs you don\u2019t want. You might also get to work at home for specific projects. As long as your work is delivered to the deadline most clients won\u2019t mind how and when you do it \u2013 making freelancing a good option for people who don\u2019t want to work normal office hours.Better pay. Freelancers can negotiate your own rates with the companies that hire you. Companies are often prepared to pay freelancers a better rate than their own staff because they don\u2019t have to pay for things like sick leave as part of the contract. The more experience you have then the more money you can ask for.Disadvantages: Getting work. There are a lot of freelancers out there and getting your first few jobs can be hard. Just being good at what you do isn\u2019t enough \u2013 you need to network, market yourself, and make contacts because no-one will hire you if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re there! The workload can be unpredictable \u2013 sometimes you might be working all night to meet three deadlines in one week, while even the most successful freelancers have months where they get no work at all.Managing your money. Not only will you not receive a regular paycheck per month, but you\u2019ll also have to make all the tax and National Insurance arrangements employers would normally do for you. You need to register yourself as \u2018self-employed\u2019. You\u2019ll also need to remember to keep some money aside for times when you\u2019re ill or there\u2019s no work \u2013 and while it might be great to have a holiday any time you want, remember that no-one will pay you for it!

            "answer_text": "Hello, if you don\u2019t have any money to invest upfront then making a decent income online within a short period of time may be pretty difficult. However you do have a good amount of options to make an additional income online without putting any money into it. The best option for you depends on you though. FASTEST OPTIONS W/NO UPFRONT COST. Option One: Completing Tasks/Survey\u2019s online - you wont get rich doing this at all, but this is completely free easy and you can expect to make a couple hundred a month if you actually work at each day. The best survey sites/task are InboxDollars (Free 5$ to Join) Swagbucks, and Mturk. I\u2019ve made about 3000$ to this date using these sites. Option Two: Ad Playlist Websites - There are literally websites out there that will pay you to just to let an automatic ad playlist to play. You click play on the ad, and then it runs all day and makes you a couple bucks each day. Won\u2019t get rich, but its free money. The best two sites for that are Eloot.gg and Perk.tv. Pretty much got a free 600$ over time with this. Option Two: Selling your unwanted belongings online, take a look around your house and see what you could live without, look it up on ebay/amazon. You would be surprised what sells. Option Three: Dropshipping, you\u2019re not really spending any money upfront with this method, but this would consist of being a middleman of a supplier and a customer. For example, say you see a nice lamp at an online store, you basically copy the pictures and description and list it on ebay at a slightly higher price, once someone else buys then you just go back to the website you found it at, use their money to buy it and ship it to their address. You would keep whatever the difference was. This is kinda risky because you\u2019re relying fully on the store to handle everything for you. Ebay holds funds for up to 3 weeks when you are starting so you would need to put the money in at first. Option Four: Fiverr, if you have any skills such as writing or video editing you can sell them to other clients. SLOWER OPTION BUT BETTER IN THE LONG RUN Affiliate Marketing: Referring a user to a product or service that you don\u2019t own. If you can get someone to purchase or use the service you\u2019ll be paid a commission. Content Creation : Blogging/Youtube. If you have a niche that you are interested in, you can create content via a blog or a youtube channel, even instagram. You won\u2019t be making much money until you have gained a following though, once you gain a following you would monetize your content with ADs and Affiliate Marketing which is referring someone to a product and or service, and if someone makes a purchase or tries what you refer them to, you would make a commission. However without following you won\u2019t be making much money, once you build one it would be a different story. Edit: Pretty much all other methods will require money, if interested let me know. HOPE THIS HELPS! ",

Take the Quora partner program, for instance (where you get paid for asking questions that get a lot of engagement). All you need is a Quora account, an internet-enabled device, and a mind! You clearly meet the first two criteria, so now you can prove that you've got the third by asking all kinds of questions that will get answered and start making money. But what you'll realize quickly is that there are no free lunches and no truly free ways to make money online. You'll spend a long time writing out questions that you think are useful, interesting and (most importantly) unique, only to find that your average return is $0.01 per question. Now take some of the other ways to make money online with little to no invested capital. You could start a marketing company and \u201ceducate\u201d mom and pop businesses about the benefits of Instagram while taking cash out of their wallets. That's a pretty good bet right now for making some kind of return, but will it actually succeed? That all depends on if you can build a book of business from scratch. Which often takes marketing. Which usually takes money. So, not exactly the free ride you're looking for. The same logic applies to all kinds of online cash cows. Mechanical Turk, online coupon arbitrage, scalping, affiliate marketing, YouTube channels. To make real money online you have to find a way to do two things: 1) get people's attention and 2) drive them to take an action that is remunerative to you. Not exactly different from starting any kind of traditional business when you think of it that way. ",

This will let you know what kind of your job you\u2019ll be happiest of. Don\u2019t think about its profit potential first. What you should really be concerned about is to search for any interest that will make you enjoy work and get paid for something you love and don\u2019t mind to do! Know your strengths and weaknesses in relation to your chosen field of profession.  When you\u2019ve identified your key interests, this will lead you to your chosen profession. And when that happens, it\u2019s time to take a good look at your reflection and know what makes you strong and weak. Afterwards, we do things to improve our strengths and reduce or eliminate our weaknesses. Invest effort in learning and gaining experience.  Don\u2019t stop learning new things. It doesn\u2019t have to be directly connected with your chosen field all the time. Any educational opportunity is ultimately beneficial because it exercises your mind. And of course, you\u2019ve heard about how experience is the best teacher, and it\u2019s still true. That\u2019s why you should do your best to gain as much experience in your preferred job. Be ethical.  Contrary to popular opinion, good guys don\u2019t finish last often nowadays. In fact, it\u2019s the big guys who are now leading the pack. You only have to look at Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to understand this. Being ethical pays, but don\u2019t do this just for the sake of higher returns. Do this because you know it\u2019s right. Be fair to your clients, employees, employers, superiors, distributors, retailers, suppliers, and all other people who are working with you. Do unto them what you want them to do unto you in short. Set standards for your company.  Having standards is a way of motivating the people in your company or business to aim higher and do better. It also lets you know whether you\u2019re making money or not, and if you are \u2013 whether you\u2019re making as much as you should or not. If you aren\u2019t, it lets you know what you\u2019re doing right and what you\u2019re doing wrong. Think of your work or business as a plant.  You need to nourish it if you want it to grow, blossom, and bear fruit. It will not survive solely on financial investment. For anything to become truly profitable, you first need to involve your body and soul into it. Rule by example. Your employees play a key part in turning your company around, and if you want them to perform well, you need to show them that you can and will always do what you\u2019re asking them to do. And most importantly of all \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to take risks.  If you focus too much on what you could lose, you might lose track completely of what you could gain if you take the risk. Instead of being impulsive, weigh your options carefully to ascertain which risks are foolish\u2026and which ones aren\u2019t. Use your heart to know which risks have great potential, but use your head to decide which is right. Footnotes[1] Is This The End of Retail Arbitrage?",

            "answer_text": " You will read a lot of answers promoting affiliate marketing systems, reselling opportunities, etc. They\u2019ll sell you on easy methods that don\u2019t take money up front or much time. Check them out, but don\u2019t let anyone sell you on quick and easy. Making a living online takes time and effort. There is no way around that. The question becomes, would you rather spend your time going from one system or rumored opportunity to another or make a solid paycheck in a real work from home job with a reputable company that will likely even include benefits? The number and types of work from home positions is constantly expanding and have been rising even during recent recessions. There are even plenty of entry-level positions. You can find plenty listed on Quora here: How can I earn money online every day? So why isn\u2019t everyone doing this? The reality is that not everyone is cut out for it. You need to be a self-managing, driven individual who doesn\u2019t work only when your supervisor is standing over you. If you are this kind of driven person, then get out there and apply. Of course, the best work from home jobs get hundreds of applicants but what most don\u2019t realize is that people tend to just submit their resume and hope. But the person who gets the job is the one who put in the extra effort. I have a new webinar coming soon on landing the best work from home jobs from anywhere without previous experience. If interested, get an alert before it fills up by going to Webinar Alerts | Work From Home. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there. There are many ways to leverage free methods of making money online. Some of the methods earn a lot, others do not. It also depends on what you do. Let\u2019s have a look at some methods. Captcha solving - 1000 captcha\u2019s equals $1. Takes you like 30 - 45min. Not worth the time.Surveys depend on if you fit the demographic, you could answer up to 14 questions to be told you are not the criteria they are looking for. If you are, upon completion expect points (to earn amazon gift cards) or anything from 0.45c to $5.Drop shipping or ecommerce. This requires start up capital and cloud softwares and hosting to do. You will need training if you do not know how to do it properly.Affiliate marketing is not as risky as the others. All you need is an affiliate network and a youtube account. That is kinda free. Depends on how you shoot the videos. Blogging falls in right under that category as you will be monetizing your blog with affiliate offers relevant to the topic that you are writing about. For example (weight loss tips, weight loss offer). The initial sale is money for you and some programs or products offer recurring commissions. In some form this is free to start. I started for free, but I had to buy proper hosting at a later stage as free can only get you so far.CPA marketing, this is where you find leads for a company. Expect to be paid anywhere from $1.50 per lead to $400 per lead. This is obviously depending on who you generate leads for. This is done via blogging or paid ads on Google or Bing.Facebook pixel installations. This works well. A company for example has no Facebook pixel, but they have a Facebook page. Their customers cannot find them or they cannot get maximum reach on their Facebook ads. You install the pixel for them and do a proper lead gen campaign. You can make anything from $200 for the pixel installation, then you use that money, run a target lead gen campaign on Facebook, also re-target people who have visited their page or website and you get maximum results. You can charge up to $3000 per campaign depending on the company size.I hope this helps out. I do affiliate marketing.

There are many free courses online, and you can also read books and join forums where you can learn from others. There are many Facebook groups, for example, where people learn by sharing ideas and information. However, if you take this approach it will take time and there is a steep learning curve. That\u2019s why many digital marketers spend some money to get their business going. The other thing I should probably tell you is that making money online is not easy. You have to be committed to what you are doing, spend a lot of time doing it and allow no distractions.

Personally I don't use another platform, but I'm sure someone can guide you on how to do this.1 is your best bet IMO. Any of these methods are going to take you months before you see serious results, but are also free.

As you already read the answers provided by other members there are not one but many ways to earn money online without any investment. but they are not for everyone as some of the ways provided there will give some quick bugs but not much that you can depend on them. First methodAs some of the methods they provided are (the easy ways) to earn some quick bugs are clicking on ads, captcha solving, filling surveys, etc. these methods are good for beginners who have no experience but for the one who wants to earn some regular or good income from the internet. this type of work will not get them what they want. As this type of work consume more time and gives less value for money. (this type of methods are suitable for those who have a lot of free time). Second methodIn which the return you get is more but the work is hard and it takes time to get the result. (this is recommended to someone who has some little bit experience or knowledge in online marketing, have some skills, ready to give some time and energy to get the result ). These include task/methods like creating a website and sell their own product/services or reselling other\u2019s goods/services and earns money, creating a youtube channel/online course and using it to generate followers/fans and money throw ads and sponsors, writing an e-book and publishing on Amazon and selling it, or maybe freelancing your skills on website like Fiverr to earn money. But the second way is the hard way making money from it is not an easy task you have to work hard and build an audience/business in order to get earn money from it. but once you achieve it you can get a regular income from it and you can totally rely on it and you will keep getting money even if you quit your job. now it's up to you to choose which method do you want to follow. Thanks, if you like the answer then upvote it. you can also comment/message me for any help related to this. ",

It can be done without investing any money, because like most of affiliate marketers, I started with no spare money and I found a way to earn it without spending it on any tools. How do I do it? I promote affiliate products on Reddit. Isn\u2019t that against the rules, you may ask? Yes, kind of. But if you\u2019re smart enough you can bank hard. Here are my Amazon affiliate earnings in 2016 (from October when I started this method) and in 2017.  Those are earnings from only one affiliate program. There are others. I promote about 8 different affiliate programs. My PayPal in 2018 (other affiliate programs):  How much time do I spend a day working on this method? Up to 2 hours a day. The best part? You don\u2019t need a website, traffic, social following or invest money with this method. The traffic is absolutely FREE! Reddit is No. 6 largest website in the world (3rd in the US) in terms of traffic. It is a hidden gem for affiliate marketers. The possibilities are endless. If you would like to learn more about this method check out this article. The most valuable thing I have gained from this is FREEDOM. I don\u2019t have to work for anyone else and I can work as much as I desire. For me it\u2019s a dream come true :)  ",

            "answer_text": "When you say investment, do you mean time, money, or both? Either way, you\u2019re going to have to invest one or both of these things to actually see any kind of results. If you\u2019re worried about not having the funds to get started on some kind of online project like affiliate marketing, then you\u2019ll need to find a way to get those funds. Doing some simple tasks around your local area could net you enough to play around with, but if offering your time to your neighborhood doesn\u2019t work for you then you could try offering your time and skills online instead. Fiverr and Upwork are a couple of such places. Fiverr allows you to throw up a few gigs for things like graphic design, content writing, programming or coding. Clients then find your gig and if they like what they see, they\u2019ll purchase gigs from you and you\u2019ll get paid for completing the services. It does take about a week before you\u2019ll see those funds though\u2026 and Fiverr does take a small percentage from what you earn. Next up is Upwork which is similar but better for higher paying jobs. Upwork is a platform that allows clients from all over the world to outsource projects or jobs to freelancers like you. To earn money, you have to bid ont he projects you\u2019re interested in and appeal to the client with a well written proposal (which takes some time and effort if you\u2019re writing your proposals right). If you win the job, then you complete it, submit the work and if the client approves, the money is released from escrow within a week and a couple of days directly to your bank account. The only problem with Upwork is that there\u2019s freelancers all over the world who are competing against you and may be willing to complete the job for a lot less than what you\u2019re willing to. This can make bidding difficult. So using the two above methods you should have a no-excuse way to come up with initial funds to play around with. What\u2019s next? I suggest affiliate marketing or even just throwing up a website and offering your own products on it. Affiliate marketing works well for those who don\u2019t want to create their own products and just want to sell or promote someone else\u2019s stuff. Selling your own products means you pocket more of the money since you\u2019re not an affiliate, but it also means more work up front to create a product to offer for sale.

            "answer_text": " One way you can make money online without investment is through matched betting and sports arbitrage. You can make a start with very little money as you are basically betting the free bonuses given to you to bet with, by the bookmakers. Once you know what you are doing you can move onto sports arbitrage, where it is possible to make 10%-20% a month. It is best to automate the search for opportunities to save you a lot of time. If you would like more info, I have a link to some free tools in my profile (linking directly within this answer is not in the spirit of Quora)\u2026 Basically, this is the process: Check out the free tools mentioned above to get an understanding of what matched betting and sports arbitrage is.Open a number of accounts with online bookmakers that offer free bonuses and \u201cmatched\u201d bonuses to boost the bank you have available with which to bet.Bet on opposite outcomes with different bookmakers to make up the minimum number of bets required to keep your free bonuses.Find arbitrage opportunities (using software makes this a lot easier, so use the week\u2019s free trial in the link I mentioned above to get a week\u2019s worth of opportunities) and make money on those.Re-invest some of the money made in that first week to subscribe to a month\u2019s use of the same software.Continue with the arbitrage for another month, re-invest some of the earnings the following month.Rinse and repeat.Good luck and remember to make sure you understand how it all works before parting with any money! It is possible to start small and scale up pretty quickly. ",

Some websites pay you to invest your TIME doing small tasks such as clicking ads, surfing the web, or testing websites and apps. However, don\u2019t expect these to make you rich overnight. Or you could start TIME consuming ways like a Youtube channel or streaming on Twitch (gaining followers takes time) If you have a SKILL or EXPERTISE in a certain area , you can monetize that skill by: Offering it as a service on online marketplaces. (e.g. Fiverr, 99designs) It depends on what service you\u2019ll offer.Working from home. There are lots of legitimate jobs online. You can work as a freelance writer, virtual assistant, or a social media manager, etc. Keep in mind that all of these require SKILL.You can apply for these jobs on job boards like Upwork, PeopleForHire, etc.If you\u2019re worried you might not have the skills, you can always try to learn them. In this age of information, anything can be found on the net. There are online courses you might find useful in Udemy or Coursera.I made an article covering these.

I suggest doing as much research and learning new skillsets in the process. I also suggest in networking. Create profiles on every social platform you can describing your experiences and skillsets. Maybe even start a free WordPress blog on something you have knowledge on. In no time if you concentrate on creating a large network for yourself, opportunities will arise. You cannot go into this field without having a network of people to share ideas and opportunities with and expect to make a living\u2026unless you have an amazing idea that's a game changer. There are a lot of pre steps to take before launching a business, you do not want to just dive into something without doing your prep work. Think of yourself as a brand, and start to connect with as many people with similar interests as possible. Networking can be completely free, and will help set you up to create a profitable business.

            "answer_text": "Hi there, I\u2019m going to tell you a few ways to earn money with ZERO INVESTMENT. Let\u2019s get started 1.Start a Blog Blogging occupies a prominent place in the online world, and it looks to continue in the foreseeable future. With tools and utilities abound, setting up a blog has never been easier. If you are new to the blogging space, there are many sites that provide free platforms (setting up takes less than an hour), and off you go! Let me give you a site : www. Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. After you have this sense that blogging is the thing for you, you may want to consider arranging your exclusive hosting and domain name (paid service). The good thing about blogging is that you are completely free to talk about anything that fancies or irritates you. You may have a strong opinion about politics or that you have something to say about AIDS prevention in South Africa. You may believe there is a serious conspiracy going on with the NSA surveillance program, or there is a serious lack of compassion in our society nowadays. The point is that there is nobody going to draw the line on what topics your blog should adhere to. You just want to make some noise and hope there is an audience outside somewhere! Blogs can be a formidable revenue generator. People have taken advantage of their blogs by placing AdSense ads, selling their own stuff, selling affiliate products, hawking advertising space, and many more. Many people make $1000 as a passive income using this method 2. Take Online Surveys An increasingly popular way to make money is to fill out online surveys in your spare time. Research companies are always recruiting new members to answer surveys and test new products. For a few minutes of form filling, you can make a couple of quid which is paid as cash or rewards. You can bag up to \u00a33 ($5) for some surveys! A few good ones to try are: Toluna , Swagbucks, MySurvey , Panel Opinion , YouGov etc But personally I recommend Swagbucks. It is an online reward site, one of the very few sites in that category that gets an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. They have paid their members $94,247,401 in free online gift cards(including PayPal), to date. You can make money doing almost anything you do online, including: Searching the webPlaying gamesShopping (you earn cash back)Taking surveysDoing easy tasks like website testingAnswering pollsIt\u2019s an easy and fun way to earn a little money without doing much but the usual stuff you do online already. You can join swagbucks here: SWAGBUCKS 3.Become a Freelancer Even if they don\u2019t find the right job for their skill, the Internet has some paid jobs for them to earn money online. Now, I am going to talk about Freelancing and how to become a good freelancer. A freelancer or freelance worker is a term commonly used for a person who is self-employed. If you have some distinct skills such as programming, designing, craft works or marketing skill etc., use them to earn money. Even if you don\u2019t find the right job for your skill, the Internet has some paid jobs to earn money online.He/she is not necessarily to work for a particular employer for a long-term or need to go to office daily for their work. He can work anytime, anywhere as his/her wish on any project he chooses to work based on their skill and passion. For an example, if you good at programming, then you can find a job based on Web Programming and coding to earn online. I would recommend using Fiverr or Upwork to ind some freelancing jobs. The best part of these websites is you can set a price yourself for doing your work. There are many people who are crushing these websites and they earn about $600 to $700 per week. Some people have made these websites as a full time income also. 4.Do micro jobs online The internet is full of choices. If you do not like to work even for a part-time commitment like freelancer but you want to make money online, then start doing small tasks and micro-jobs online. Micro-tasking is a process of splitting a large job into small tasks that can be distributed over the Internet to many people. Each task is assigned to individuals based on their skills. I would recommend Clixsense, Microworkers, Mturk On successful completion of each task will pay you around $1 \u2013 $10. This is an yet another easy way to make money every day. 5. Affiliate Marketing This is one of the best ways to earn money online. Personally I have had a success in this area and helped many people to establish a stable business. If you've got a good presence on social media or perhaps you even have a blog or website, you can start bringing in money immediately by promoting all sorts of companies, products, services and offers online. With affiliate marketing, you are not involved in the creative part of the work, like conceiving products or services. As an affiliate, your main responsibility is to move products made by others in order to earn a commission.There are many people who earn around $500 to $1000 per day. It might require a minimal investment to get started so that you can do it in the right way and for the training to understand it. But again it entirely depends on the work and effort a person has put into. You can visit my bio to understand how it works and if you want I can help you get started. Hope this answer helps you ",

And then over time, you can earn 500-60 a day. The same is true of online earning. If you are dreaming of earning without investing, stop it. Yes, someone will show you the shortcuts but at least you have to invest up to Rs 5,000. I have experience in blogging and YouTube. When I started my own website The Lit Things (The Lit Things ) I had a modest cost to buy a domain. Advertisements have just begun to arrive in just one month. Now if you want to earn more, you have to organize your website. Similarly, you have to constantly upload good quality videos to the YouTube channel. For which you have to spend on systematic data connection, mic, editing software,  etc. Money is like running water. If we invest it well today, it will pay off in the future. If you can't afford the money, you can spend a lot of money on simple things, even if it means reducing your own needs. That rupee will give you the compensation you need. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Freelance employeeOne of the most popular ways to earn is to become a freelance worker and to write informational texts of various purposes. \"Digitization\" has changed the specifics of many works - including the writer of texts. By working on web projects, it's extremely easy not just to organize your own time, but also the specifics of the topics you want to be close to them. What do you need to succeed in joining this market? Ability to think more and write interestingly and excitingly. Of course, a computer and excellent grammar knowledge are the prerequisites for doing this work. If you are able to quickly, creatively and intellectually generate words - additional revenue is already in your account. 2. Online surveysAnother alternative is online surveys. In this case, you do not need any special education or abilities. This is probably the easiest way to make money at home. You only need internet and free time to answer a wide range of anonymous surveys. 3. Private lessonsAnother way to make money is to convey the available knowledge. Sell \u200b\u200byour music skills, foreign language, yoga, or dog training skills - offer lessons, but do not forget to ask your potential competitors at the suggested prices and offer some of your services a little cheaper. You have to understand that you must be not only a teacher, but also a comprehensive \"entrepreneur\" capable of transforming the old idea into a new one and thus attracting the audience. With customer focus, you may develop all of this as an individual business. ",

Most people want to earn from internet without investing much money which is absolutely possible and there are numerous ways to do that. However, very few people end up actually earning because though investing money is not essential, investing sincere time is. You cannot hope to build anything online that will churn money while you sit and sip coffee or whatever drink suits you at some luxury resort. For making real money online, you need not invest money, but need to invest serious time on just three simple tasks..! Valuable content creation,Identifying the right audience andUsing the best channels to ensure the content reaches the targeted audience.Sounds really easy but if it really were, we'd be surrounded with teenage millionaries all around us. The problem is with perseverance. Nothing good comes cheap and if you really want to make money online, research on how you can achieve the above 3 to perfection and then devote time regularly on all the three tasks and don't stop to it until you yourself feel satisfied with your work. That's the mantra you need for making money online with little investment :) ",

You can pick a nice product at a fair price from LaYuva, recommend them to your friends and families, or share them on your social media channels, and then tell them to buy products through your links if they like them. This helps them save a lot of money. Once they make orders for the products you share, LaYuva will dispatch them and handle the after-sale service for you. Most importantly, you will earn money from LaYuva. You are not making money from your friends, you make money from LaYuva.

See Get Paid For Advertising Online Without A Website - To do this you need to write a lot of content on a free blogging site like Hubpages.com. The site lets you monetise it with affiliate marketing and Google Adsense. With a lot of traffic, and the right kind of traffic, you can start generating some income if you are successful. It\u2019s better to create your own website and get your own hosting for a couple of reasons. Firstly, sites like Hubpages don\u2019t do well in the search engines. Google doesn\u2019t rank them so you\u2019ll need all your traffic from the Hubpages site itself and from wherever you can share it. Building a website to make money doesn\u2019t require a huge investment. A domain and hosting will only set you back about $10 a month. But you\u2019ll still need to work incredibly hard building content if you don\u2019t want to pay for marketing it. Paid marketing is costly but a far faster way to build an online business. If you\u2019re prepared to invest in a high ticket sales funnel and paid marketing, you can be profitable far more quickly. But you\u2019ll need to invest more to purchase a sales funnel with a range of high commission affiliate products in it. ",

However, SB works only in the following countries: USA, UK, Canada, Australia and Ireland. Possibly India and Germany too (still yet to confirm). Here is an article for further details. Alternative option is doing the work for others, that is freelancing. For example, you are good with languages then you would translate stuff for your virtual \u201cemployer\u201d, or you are good with writing, then you could do the editing or writing articles for bloggers.

Lets say you don\u2019t have money to invest then you have to invest more time. In 2018 you cannot make money without an real investment. But the investment doesn\u2019t have to be too much. My suggestion is sell your skill online in places like fiverr. But trust me, you will have to spend a lot of time and effort. It may takes months and years depending on how much hours you put into it. If you want to start a online business, you have to invest money, thats how it works. Maybe it was free 5 years a go but not anymore. Hope it helps ",

Plus the unrealistic BS going around about making $1,000,000 a month. It took me 12 months to get my first $. An affiliate account earns me on average $15 /mth but if you get enough of them it soon adds up and is passive income. Start learning right here on Quora and stick at it. I guarantee you will try for a few days and give up because folks expect instant success. Plus a lot get suckered into paying for BS courses that promise you a quick route to riches. I learned in my late 40\u2019s that the World is full of abundance and there is money lying all about for the taking but most people are just too dumb and lazy to look. This is my favourite video which shows how you cannot even give money away for free.  Take notice because that is you walking past the guy giving out money for free in the street. ",

I can tell you honestly that when it comes to making money it always takes money to make money whether you borrow that start-up money (Loan, CC, Grants, Etc) or are able to find investors it will always require you put something into the business if you are serious about earning money in general. I would first suggest you look into personal development and I would focus on developing a different mindset. The question you should be asking is how much money do I want to make online. By asking and focusing on the cost you are subconsciously thinking in scarcity and not in abundance. If you are focusing on the cost you are already doubting yourself. What you focus on expands, so be mindful of your thoughts as P = T = F = A = R (Your mental Programming leads to Thoughts, your thoughts lead to Feelings, your feelings lead to Actions and your actions leads to Results). To sum this up, your mind is not in the right spot yet for you to become an entrepreneur. The good news is you can re-program your thoughts with personal development. I wish you the best and if I can help you in anyway feel free to reach out to me and I will be happy to help. Great question though! ",
