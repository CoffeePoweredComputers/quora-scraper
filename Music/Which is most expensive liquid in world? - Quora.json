Well, these are a few but they are different - they are liquids though: Scorpion Venom $39,000,000 per gallon.King Cobra Venom $153,000 per gallon.Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) $123,000 per gallon.Horseshoe Crab Blood $60,000 per gallon.Chanel No. 5 $26,000 per gallon.Insulin $9,400* per gallon.Mercury $3,400 per gallon.Black Printer Ink $2,700 per gallon.Well, I\u2019ll also give you a cool fact! You know what! I think, probably by the next 50 years or so, water will become the most expensive liquid! Yeah! Scientists are arguing over it, and they say that there will be a WW3 (I mean World War 3, lol) due to water scarcity due to the depletion of available fresh water. So, yeah, it could become an expensive liquid! Hope you enjoyed the cool fact! ",
