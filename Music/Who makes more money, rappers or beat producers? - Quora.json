            "answer_text": "In this day and age. The rapper is making way more money. The rapper is the artist, so we have shows. Killing festivals all year. Not really paying producers for their work. Rappers have merchandise to sell. They get paid for writing lyrics to their songs or writing lyrics and melodies. So they get paid when their songs are streamed or downloaded. Bottom line! They should come out on top with a lil more than a producer. Maybe 10 to 15 years ago. The producer racked up in just about everything. They worked with rappers and got money up front and on the back end. Their advance money could be big if they were well known. Producers would get up to 200,000 dollars for one song when a rapper worked with them. They get points on every record downloaded or cd sold. Plus the money from that. And if they were a songwriter of the music, they would get 50% writers/publishing on the record too. This is a lot of money for a producer. Back then! But today. You can\u2019t get this as a producer anymore. You would have to be a songwriter of music too. Theirs more songwriter/producers in this day and age than anything else. But this is just my scope and opinion. ",
