            "answer_text": "As an acoustic guitarist, there are several that everyone seems to take a stab at, and despite the fact that some of them have become cliches, they are all good exercises for new guitarists. Blackbird Dust in the Wind Stairway to Heaven Over the Hills and Far Away Embryonic Journey Blackbird is a great introduction to the clawhammer technique(look it up! There are great online lessons!) When the Beatles recorded the tune, Donovan had just taught John Lennon how to play with the clawhammer method, and Paul learned on his own after listening on the sly, so the song is fairly elementary - exploring it as a guitarist, you can experience some of the magic that Paul must have felt when he wrote the piece. it also moves up the entire fretboard, which is an important step for a beginner guitarist to take! The melody is simple and elegant, and if you learn Blackbird, you will add a few significant phrases to your guitar vocabulary. Dust in the Wind is a great introduction to Travis picking. Even if you don\u2019t like the song or plan to perform it, it is one of the best tunes out there for developing the alternating bass pattern that is at the root of most fingerpicked guitar. Stairway is good a good lesson because it has a simple but challenging melody, and some very dramatic rhythm shifts. It also makes very nice use of counterpoint (ascending melody, descending bass) and explores a bit more of the fretboard than most beginners are comfortable with. It also moves from an almost classical introduction into a few folky verses, but finishes as a rocker, so you get an interesting blend of styles - and all the styles represented are WELL represented! All three are great introductions to fingerpicking. The last two expand on the first three - similar lessons but with different applications. Over The Hills is great because it illustrates how a deceptively simple riff can be to core of a complex and interesting song. Musically it is a strong enough piece that it works well with or without vocals. Embryonic Journey is great for learning finger positions for chords other than the standard ones - that lovely hammer-on intro, and its canny use of dropped D tuning to get a great descending bass line. And he\u2019s playing basic chords - D, A, G but all over the fretboard. ",
