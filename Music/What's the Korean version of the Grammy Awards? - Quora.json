            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to pick just one Korean answer to the Grammy Awards, but the closest would be the Melon Music Awards IMO. One would say, \u2018what about MAMA?\u2019 While MAMA (or the Mnet Asian Music Awards) can count too and there are some similarities between both awards, the difference is that the MMA covers Korean music as a whole, not just K-pop. You have categories dedicated to K-rap, K-rock, R&B and even folk. Likewise, international artists are also nominated in their own category. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026It would have to be the Korea Music Awards, or KMAs. The reason I say this is because unlike other Asian awards shows, the KMAs do not utilize record sales as a factor in determining who wins the award. Instead, they give out awards based on the recommendations of a panel of music critics and other professionals in the industry. Most K-POP artists aren't even nominated for the KMAs. No other \u201cidols\u201d besides BTS and PSY have ever won a Daesang, or Grand Prize, for Musician of the Year. In an industry so heavily fixated on idols, that\u2019s surprising, right? Just goes to show how critically acclaimed these awards are rather than most other awards shows, which are essentially a popularity contest in who has the biggest fandom.
