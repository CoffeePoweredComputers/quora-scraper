            "answer_text": "Monbebe - I\u2019d say Monbebe is still the nicest big fandom there is, as it\u2019s usually super friendly and nice towards other groups and fandoms. However MBB does have problems with international and korean part getting into fanwars, so we really need to work on that. But yeah, MX doesn\u2019t get mobbed by Monbebe, and has a fairly close relationship with the fans. Also Monbebe x Carat married forever. iKONIC - I\u2019m adding the fandom here for the fact that iKON has always felt so comfortable with the fandom to literally stand in the middle of fans and hug them etc., and will take selfies, sign things, and are generally cool with the fans interacting with their families too even. Also the fandom has always encouraged them to date freely. The fandom in general is nice and friendly, especially if you are a part of it (and will accept new iKONICs super fast), but will attack people that are ot6 stans or people who hate on Hanbin/use his name for clout/discredit his and iKON\u2019s achievements. Quite many people forget iKON has multiple daesangs\u2026 Ahgase/iGOT7 - I don\u2019t stan GOT7, but Ahgase is an extremely well-mannered and very friendly fandom, that\u2019s known to be super supportive of other groups too. Carat - Basically the same case as Ahgase, I don\u2019t stan Seventeen, but if there\u2019s a fandom even less toxic than Monbebe then it\u2019s probably Carat. ToMoon - ONEUS got so much shit for Lit from bigger fandoms, but ToMoon managed to handle it nicely and stay friendly the same time, no wonder how ONEUS\u2019 popularity is growing so quickly. ATINY - They are hilarious and friendly, and they seem to be developing a similar brotherhood with ToMoon and STAY as Caratbebe has. inSomnia - Friendly, well-mannered, and very well-fed, as Dreamcatcher is very approachable and nice for fans. Even hugging fans at times.  Disclaimer: I\u2019m aware that there are other nice fandoms too, these were simply the ones that came to my mind first. ",

            "answer_text": "EXO-L: I went to the EXO concert in Dallas when I was 15. My parents went with me, but I had a seat closer to the stage while they were at the back. The EXO-Ls surrounding me was so nice. The two in front of me (I don\u2019t know if they meant to do it, but this happened) never got in my way so I was able to watch the concert and the two beside me made sure I was comfortable. It was a nice experience especially since that was my first concert ever. Starlights: I checked out VIXX and watched the videos I never saw Starlights doing anything bad. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Starlights in a fan war and sometimes when I watch other groups I see Starlights helping the other fandom stream the music video. ARMY: Oof I\u2019m probably going to get a lot of people that disagree. I\u2019m listing them because when I first joined the k-pop fandom I started with BTS. In the comment for \u201cWe Are Bulletproof pt. 2\u201d a person was commenting about how they were new to the fandom and if they could get recommendations to songs that had similar meanings. A few ARMYs answered and recommended songs and other groups that also have songs with similar meanings (The recommended group was B.A.P) MyDays: My favorite fandom period! I love the fact that they\u2019re chill and if you watch fancams the Day6 members are able to get close without being harassed. Very mature and respectable fandom InSomnias Blackjacks To be honest I could probably put all of the k-pop fandoms in here. All of the fandoms are nice there are just some bad apples. ",
