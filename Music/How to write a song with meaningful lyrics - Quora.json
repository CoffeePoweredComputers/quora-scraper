            "answer_text": "I write meaningful things to a meaningful person. The things that make my heart stop, they are the moments that could be lyrics. The things that I want to tell her, to make her realise just how wonderful she is, they are the moments that could be lyrics. Here With Me was when I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and she looked so peaceful as she slept, I realised the responsibility that I had for her. The two songs Come Home and Stay were when we were asleep and she had to get up early in the morning to go to work, which I could only miss her as she drove away to work. I have made money off those but that will never be the criteria for success. Although I am in the process of writing The Last Line and Eveline, I naturally wish I could write something every day. I realised early on, though, that reading every day, watching news images, talking to people, watching colours change, walking along boundary lines, etc. would put me in a good position for when I was ready to write something. There are different tips and hints that I have followed from other people but maybe the most pertinent one here would be to write figuratively in the verses and literally in the refrain/chorus, or the other way around, but never in combination. That is something that seems to work for me. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't write songs, but I do write a lot, and one of the best ways I've found to inspire me, is take a long look at one's own life. Find a part of it that was either the best or worst and mentally and emotionally get into it. Make sure you know with every fibre of your being how it felt at the time; the joy, the sorrow, the laughter and/or the tears. Write that feeling from the very center that is you; raw, shiny, angry, brilliant. Make your words tell about that moment. Make them so undeniably real that the person reading or listening to your lyrics can feel what you are. Make their hearts bleed like yours does, make their hearts twist, and wrench those people out of their world into yours and make them, for a brief moment, be you. Songs are poems set to music, and there are so many different styles of poems, just as there are innumerable amounts of different song styles and musical instruments. Once you have your words, and once you have the style, then choose the instrument you want to interpret those words and emotions that you have penned. And when you do, keep me in mind because I would love to hear it!! Good luck!! ",
