            "answer_text": "You might like Radiohead. Especially their albums \u201cThe Bends\u201d and\u201d \u201dOK Computer\u201d. I\u2019ll recommend some of their songs: Fake Plastic TreeParanoid AndroidClimbing Up The WallsElectioneeringThe BendsCreepMuse was heavily influenced by Radiohead (Matthew Bellamy\u2019s voice is quite like Thom Yorke\u2019s.) Also their later, more experimental and electronic albums got a dark, sad mood. I can also recommend some other songs: (in brackets are the songs/artists they sound like) Hurt by Nine Inch NailsMy name is Human by Highly Suspect (Nuclear, Royal Blood and Muse)Blood On My Name by The Brothers Bright (Nuclear)Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden (Muse?)One Last Breath by CreedNo One Knows by QOTSA (Royal Blood)Another Way To Die by Jack White (Royal Blood)Breezeblocks by Alt-JCenturies by Fall Out Boy (Warriors)Live in the Dark by Jeff Beck (Royal Blood)Where Is My Mind by Pixies (Muse, Royal Blood)Numb by Gary Clark Junior (Royal Blood)These are just a few. I can name you some more if you want to. But now enjoy listening. :) ",

            "answer_text": "King Crimson - Starless (OFFICIAL) Beautiful KC song, in the key of G minor (happens to be my favorite key) Like A Stone Another lovely song in G minor (this time by Audioslave) Shine On You Crazy Diamond ALSO in G minor, a classic Pink Floyd staple paying homage to Syd Barrett. Opeth - Hessian Peel (Audio) Bounces between a few different keys (mainly E minor, C# minor, F# minor, B minor). I know, it\u2019s death metal, but I couldn\u2019t help but include this one here. Time This is a pretty heart-wrenching song by Pink Floyd in the key of F# minor, and has one of my favorite guitar solos of all time on it. Empire Of The Clouds An absolutely INCREDIBLE piece of music written by Iron Maiden on their latest album, The Book of Souls. Truly the band\u2019s magnum opus. Also, it\u2019s in E minor, the hallmark key for Iron Maiden (and, indeed, for a lot of Metal bands). The list could go on ad infinitum, but I thought that these would be a good showcase of the minor mode with some of my favorite keys in rock music. ",
