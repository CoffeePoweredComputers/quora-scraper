            "answer_text": "If there is one kpop idol I know for a fact is fake, a liar and a manipulator, its Izone Sakura Read this if you think I'm wrong. Some of you might know IZ*ONE's Sakura, the group's most popular member who's also a part of AKB - HKT48.  To give you an idea of her popularity : she's one of the most popular idols in Japan's HISTORY. She has a massive fanbase in China, her own radio show, her photobooks sell more than most kpop GG albums, she's already super popular in SEA and she won #2 at PD48 in Korea. Sakura has always been ifan's favorite too. She has been the most popular from the start - so popular, that her fans bullied Wonyoung for winning center spot, mass disliked her video, keep trashing on her even though she's 14 years old. Her fans are the absolute worst. Worse than Blackpink Lisa's akgaes and that is really something. But that's for another thread. Her fans are COMPLETELY aware of what she did. Yet Sakura gets away with everything she does! Let's start with how she finally got center on AKB.  This is 17 years old Sakura with 57 years old Akimoto ( AKB director producer ect ) on a date.Not just an ordinary date, they went to a cinema and a play. The problem points that fans pointed out: Sakura pestered Akimoto to goEven though she could have went with one of the members she invited himThey were alone without staffThese were tickets that Johnny wotas wanted very badlyThis didn't come to light from an announcement via SNS to fans but from a picture taken by a regular personAkimoto is wearing clothing in an effort to appear youngSakura is holding a paper bag that is thought to contain a present bought by AkimotoShe is holding a 130,000 yen miu miu bagAfterwards Akimoto tried to hide Sakura from reporting of ithttps://onehallyu.com/topic/169564-...ith-17-year-old-hkt48-member-miyawaki-sakura/ - more here This isn't new. Many AKB girls went on dates with him, to get a center single or just expensive stuff. This is no secret.She was SEVENTEEN. He was NEARLY 60.Akimoto is also married and has a daughter. He was the director of AKB. Sakura could have gone with anyone else, her friends or anyone. But yet she decided to invite a nearly 60 man on a 2 person date. It was clear what her intentions were.She wanted to get an important role in the group not through her skills but rather getting a favor from Akimoto. And Akimoto has a long history of going on \u201cdates\" with teenage girls and somehow those teenage girls always got favoured than others. Think about it yourself, she wasnt just trying to climb the social ladder, she was intentionally trying to get favoured by Akimoto. After it was revealed about the date, Akimoto revealed she was the one who pestered him to go. Akimoto had even told her to not tell anyone about the date. Now think of this, one girl tries her very best and has great skills etc, but another girl invites the director on a date and tries to create a good impression not through her talent but through other ways. Not saying Sakura doesnt have skills, but it's clear what her intentions were here.  AKB48: A Microcosm Of Dark Corporate Japan. Sexual exploitation of child labor is sooo cute. (Book review) Next, Yep. All of this. Yokoyama Yui, AKB's current captain, said that Sakura pretends to suck at sports and to have horrible physical skills so her fans feel sorry for her. She also said that Sakura fakes a weird and funny way to run just to catch people's attention. During a team rope skipping event, she tried to get the attention from others by purposely ruining the skipping process. It was mentioned that she moved stealthily to the side without trying to get noticed by the rest. In the end, the team failed to complete several rounds due to her \u2018foul\u2019 play. Refuses to pose for top16 pic for X reason. She just doesn't show up. Many idols would kill to be at her place but nope she doesn't go. Made fun of her fans for being old and bald. Drew them then mocked them. During a handshake event with fans, many members were falling sick due to poor health issues. Even members who were known to take good care of their body eventually did not attend the handshake event because of them being unwell. After the event had ended, Miyawaki Sakura wrote a post about how it is unprofessional to miss a handshake event just because one is sick. It seemed like she was attacking them on the back. However, when she finally fell sick and did not attend a handshake event, she gave excuses, calling it an \u2018adult issue\u2019 for her absence.Okay fine. Then why did you act like that when your members couldn't attend? When she couldn't attend no member said anything about her but when her members didnt attend, she said it was disrespectful.This is the trait of a person who has two faces. She was crying really hard when Takamina pranked them with a fake scandal and everyone thought she was so sweet b/c she cared so much. Then they later found out she only cried crying because it was before her first single as center and she thought the scandal would affect the sales or cancel it. About fatshaming :   It was confirmed she wasn't hacked at all lol. She just made fun of her member on the wrong account. This was meant for her private and instead, ended up on her official so she faked everything and quickly changed the subject. Once, a japanese MC from a TV show said that she is one of the fakest female celebrities in the whole entertainment industry. I also remember the scandal when Mayuyu (another highly popular ex-member) said Sakura is \u201cplastic surgery monster\u201d and start doing many jobs on a very young age. On a TV show, she once said that she doesn't think that she can beat Jurina on Sousenkyo, because Jurina is strong, and looks like a dellinquent and someone who knows how to fight well, and that Sakura herself was a sweet and fragile girl, whom her fans would want to protect at all costs.  At a HKT 4th Anniversary Event a fan asked her something, and she answered in a really serious rough tone: \"I posted it on my blog, didn't u see it?\"Meru (the one who she said that was exploding with fatness) was a MC at the moment and could overcome the situation. At a Kibouteki Refrain's presentation on TV, Sakura got a really important part of the choreography wrong, clearly differing herself from everybody else, who were dancing it all correctly. Later, on her blog, she said \"Oh, my mistake was a good thing, thanks to it they even made a section for me at a show called Utage\", what made lots of HKT fans to think that she made it on purpose.Fine. Il assume you were nervous. But then, on her blog when her fans asked why she made mistakes she said that her mistake was quote\"good\" and that she got attention from it not thinking how the performance cost her team. That's right. She thinks her mistake was a good thing for her cause she got attention. But what about her team ?        She's the girl Malluyu, another former Japanese idol called a \u201c Plastic surgery monster\". Although that source isnt trustworthy. Sidenote: The credits for this answer go to The truth about IZ*ONE Sakura. [ warning - somewhat long post ] Check it out please. I'd also like to add that there are always idols like her in Kpop, but that doesnt make everyone the same as her. Fans hate on other kpop idols like Jennie saying she has an attitude problem, Chaeryoung by calling her ugly, Yeri for breathing etc. But unfortunately the actual rotten apples like Izone Sakura seem to never even be noticed. I bet most people reading this right now didnt know any of this before. ",
