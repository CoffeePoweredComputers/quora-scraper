            "answer_text": "This is an archaic form of English address, but young men too young to be called \u201cMister\u201d and also the firstborn son of their families used to have the honorific \u201cMaster.\u201d So, you might\u2019ve been referred to as \u201cMaster Smith\u201d before you attained your majority. That said, modern custom is to avoid giving yourself an honorific unless someone addressing you gets it wrong. For example, I didn\u2019t get married until I was in my thirties. Accordingly, I was sometimes addressed as \u201cMrs. MaidenName\u201d by people who assumed I must be married at my age. I corrected that by telling the speaker, \u201cActually, it\u2019s Miss (or Ms)\u201d in cases where my marital status was relevant. On the other hand, my husband gets addressed as \u201cMister Chang\u201d all the time. Technically, he\u2019s \u201cDoctor Chang,\u201d but it\u2019s not relevant except in formal professional or academic settings. He doesn\u2019t correct people who use \u201cMister\u201d socially. In social situations, introduce yourself with just your name. Don\u2019t attach an honorific. I know it sounds cool and very grown up, but in modern usage, that has a definite air of Trying Too Hard. If honorifics are called for, other people will use them when they address you. If you\u2019re writing business or formal letters, you put yourself down in the header as \u201cMr. FirstName LastName.\u201d If you\u2019re writing a casual or social letter, you don\u2019t need the header, and in all cases, you should sign with just your name.

            "answer_text": "Im surprised so many women answer this question. How would you know? :p I was addressed as Master until I was 18. And Im from Texas! I would never refer to myself as master\u2026I guess, especially in the South. :p But in school, all the boys were mister (I feel it appropriate to use lower-case for some reason). Master, like most forms of etiquette, may be quickly falling into disuse. But I think maintaining some (even seemingly arcane) traditions keeps us tied to the generations before us who took good manners terribly seriously. To our fathers. And the traditions BEHIND the language we use. Being of non-Anglo Saxon parents, I consider respecting Anglo tradition all the more important. As I would capitalize You to a Russian (despite the fact we only capitalize references to God in this way in English). Or address an officer by rank (indeed taking the time to learn ranks as a show of being courtesy). Hell, I even thank Siri! :p For me, respect must be earned. But good manners and being courtious separate us from the great heathens. Those animals who we see on YouTube fighting over all possible non-sense. Those animals that let the door slan in your face or demand rights without giving them in return. \"Master\" is all of this- though no one takes the time to think about it. At the end of the day, your self-image is also something you earn. \"Gentleman\" is truly something more than a name on a toilet door. To be one, you must act as one. Even when many think it queer. Would we really be all the worse off for it? ",
