            "answer_text": "What makes Satan angry? Satan, which means Resister, wanted the worship and glory that is due only to God, the Creator of all things. His first overt action of turning Adam and Eve away from God, speaking through a serpent, shows that he challenged God\u2019s authority, claimed God was lying, and suggested that man would be better off under his rule, rather than God\u2019s. (Genesis 3:1\u20137, Revelation 12:9) In the book of Job, Satan appears before God at an assembly of angels in heaven, and claims that man serves God only for selfish reasons. God then allows him to bring all sorts of calamities on the righteous man Job in an effort to break Job\u2019s integrity, an effort which, despite great personal loss to Job, fails. (Job 1:13\u201319; 2: 7, 8; 42:10\u201317) Satan is shown later in the bible as ruling the demons, that is, angels who joined him in his rebellion against God, and misleading the earth. The apostle John states plainly that the world lies in Satan\u2019s power at the present time. (1 John 5:19) He attempts to put Jesus to death as a baby and later tempts him face to face in an effort to cause him to sin against God. Jesus identifies Satan as the ruler of the world shortly before his execution. (John 14:30) He is shown after Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection to heaven as fighting against the newly-formed Christian congregations, and the apostle Paul writes several times to warn these early Christians of the works of Satan and those of his agents. (2 Corinthians 11:14, 15) However, throughout all this, Satan knows that his eventual destruction is inevitable. The first prophecy recorded in the Bible, at Genesis 3:14, 15, identifies that he will eventually be crushed, that is, destroyed. The Revelation given to the apostle John includes a vision of Satan\u2019s future exile to the earth, and says that he would have great anger at this, knowing that he has a short period of time left.(Revelation 12:7\u201312). Finally, in Revelation chapter 20, Satan\u2019s eventual end is described as being thrown into fire, which symbolises everlasting destruction in the Bible, a second death from which there is no resurrection. So Satan is angry because his challenges to God, that man could rule better under him, and that men would serve God only out of selfishness, have been proved false, and he and his fellow rebel angels await imminent destruction.

            "answer_text": "Satan nis angry when Christians live lives that are pleasing to God. This includes sharing the gospel, living a Godly life infront of their neighbors and co workers, spending time in prayer and Bible study, fellowshipping with other believers. Satan hates all of that. It makes him so angry. Satan tries even harder to tempt believers into doing something that would displeased God. When he succeeds he does his little happy dance. But his joy is short lived when the believer confesses his sin and returns to holy living. Satan knows he will ultimately loose. Hell is his eternal destination and place of eternal pain and punishment. It is also the same place for unbelievers. Now is the accepted time. Today is the day of Salvation. Believe that Jesus paid that eternal price. Believe on Him. Make Satan angry. Make our loving and gracious God happy and enter into the joy of your salvation. ",
