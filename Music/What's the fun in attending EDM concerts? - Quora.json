            "answer_text": "Well, a couple of things.  I'm a rocker -- I like rock music. Period. But I also like new music. So every year, I go to the Firefly Music Festival | June 16-19, 2016. They have lots of new stuff.. and lots of other music. Rap/Hip-Hop. EDM. Blues. Even the occasional bit of Pop.  But it's all good... I'm there to hear new stuff. So I've gone to some EDM shows, and some of the best. I saw Calvin Harris a few years back, I saw Pretty Lights last year, and others. When I saw Calvin Harris, I didn't know much about him... I was with some kids, and they wanted to go there before we saw Red Hot Chili Peppers. Ok, sure. My impressions... he was a very good musician. His music was well done -- he's a DJ in performances, but he's playing stuff he did himself in the studio, he's got singers, etc. He had a pretty amazing light show, too.  But after awhile, it was boring... too repetitive. Ok, so maybe I didn't have the right drugs :-)  But more seriously, I was doing \"the rock thing\" at that show... standing still and listening. EDM = Electronic Dance Music. In short, you're not supposed to stand there like a dork. You're supposed to be part of the party... dance, throw confetti or light sticks or chalk or whatever. At Firefly, it's probably well after midnight if you're at an EDM show... it's that, or sleep. No one wants sleep. But my point -- the music is only part of the expected experience.  Another part of it is familiarity. When I went to that RHCP show, I had a fantastic time. They were good, sure, but part of it was that I knew every song. I had never heard Calvin Harris before. So before I saw Pretty Lights, I had downloaded a couple of albums (Pretty Lights and Pretty Lights ), and I liked it. Sure, repetitive, but also really good for the kind of music (I'll admit, I was into early electronic music in college: Tangerine Dream, Synergy, Vangelis, etc.). So seeing the show live, I was already receptive.  That's not to say I'd love any EDM show. I tried another last year, and I just didn't get into it... won't mention the artist. Maybe just me, maybe I was tired, maybe I was unprepared. I gave it a shot. And these days, before I head out to any festival like Firefly, I listen to every artist. Because it's not just listening and not liking.. who cares. But the ones I should have heard but missed and later got into -- that's tragic. So always opt on the side of expanding your musical horizons.   ",

            "answer_text": "I understand the question. That's the question my wife and I asked ourselves in 2013, at almost age 60 at that time, every time after we saw some old rock band from 60 and 70s, just spent a few hundred dollars chasing memories of good old times, and always being disappointed listening about performance at the end. We had to let go of the past. We have seen over 50 DJs since then, will attend EDC for the second time and generally go to every EDM event in the greater Phoenix area. I am still too self conscious otherwise I would let lose and dance with let's say similar (not the same :) movements then the EDM fans, many of which we are friends with, on FB. We love the music, we love the people, the light shows, we love what PLUR stands for. The emotional high and mental high after three days at EDC, a natural high that must have released triple the amount of endorphins (no drugs needed for us) that lasted weeks. People are smiling, they are happy, supporting, nice people who know how to party (responsibly for my wife and I). We love the loud music, the melodies, the harmonies and the drops, and at one point, we become so one with the music that the body kind of disappears, the loudness becomes still, and peace has set in, past and future have been released from our demands to be in our will and likeness and we let the music and the sound tell us a story about \"NOW\" in which no conflict is ever possible. This is what happens to us when we go to an EDM concert, knock on wood, without exception. Does not mean that EDM is for everyone as everyone resonates and is attracted to what is like them. It's like a first date, you know If there is a matchmuch faster than what we sometimes admit rather than accepting the difference as nothing personal and moving on. You have to be yourself in every aspect and if EDM is not it, give some other genre a try. There are so many and something for everyone.Good luck!  ",
