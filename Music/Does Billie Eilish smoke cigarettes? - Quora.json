Her song \u2018Xanny\u2019 expresses her attitude towards these things quite clearly as she describes being at a party among people her age; I'm in their second hand smoke, still just drinking canned coke\u2026I don't need a \u2018xanny\u2019 to feel betterOn designated drives home, only one who's not stoned\u2026Don't give me a \u2018xanny\u2019 now or ever Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk\u2026 on your cigarette breakI can't afford to love someone\u2026 who isn't dying by mistake Interesting way to frame smoking, right? She won\u2019t date someone who \u201cisn\u2019t dying by mistake\u201d, ie; she can\u2019t be with someone who is intentionally killing themselves. She\u2019s made other references in her music to her abstinence from drugs and alcohol, and insinuates that love is the only drug she ever wants. This excerpt from \u201cMy Strange Addiction\u201d sums it up quite well; My doctors can't explain, my symptoms or my painBut you are\u2026 my strange addiction Deadly fever, please don't ever breakBe my reliever, 'cause I don't self medicate Here\u2019s hoping that she never changes, at least on these principles.
