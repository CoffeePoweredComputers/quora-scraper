            "answer_text": "Well\u2026This is just my opinion and my personal belief\u2026well more like my personal opinion. Its ok if no one agrees with me everyone has their own opinons and point of views. Well here is my opinion nothing is inevatible. The inevitable can become evitable just recently i thought that there was no way of avoiding someone or something. But i just found out i can avoid what i thought was to be inevitable. Coincidences are unperdictable no one can no when they will happen its one of lifes greatest mysteries. Coincidences are real as some inevitable becoming evitable. Coincidences are as real as we are haven\u2019t you ever experinced coincidences at least once in your life i have experienced quite a few. Coincidences are formed from ones own life and the bonds we make and the path we walk everything and everyone is connected. Im reading a manga where in one chapter that they talked about coincidences and i agree with them almost everything we do seems to be predestined to happen after all god did create you and let you choose your path and made somethings predestined. ok the last part was kind of like my personal opinion.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s define these two big words in\u00b7ev\u00b7i\u00b7ta\u00b7ble 1.certain to happen; unavoidable.\"war was inevitable\"synonyms:unavoidable, inescapable, inexorable, ineluctable;co\u00b7in\u00b7ci\u00b7dence 1.a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances without apparent causal connection.\"it's no coincidence that this new burst of innovation has occurred in the free nations\"synonyms:accident, chance, serendipity, fortuity, providence, happenstance, fate; a fluke\"too close to be mere coincidence\"So the claim is that there are no events that seem connected without actual connection and that the only things that can happen are the things that are certain to happen. Kinda seems like an obvious statement with no real depth to it. It\u2019s just like saying, everything happens for a reason and when something has happened, we\u2019ll say it was always going to happen. Apart from all that, we humans are really good at finding patterns, it\u2019s sort of the reason we were able to survive in the harsh world we find ourselves in. If you look for a connection between two things; \u2018There are no coincidences only the inevitable\u2019 fact that you will likely find it. ",
