            "answer_text": "It\u2019s initially about a relationship with the woman he loves in the movie Purple Rain which the song of the same title comes from. He would rather be a good friend than a sometime lover. It\u2019s about loss, sorrow and pain. Just like the song says in the lyrics: \u201cI never wanted to be your weekend lover I only wanted to be some kind of friend.\u201d (But it could be any friend) Again he uses a lot of spiritual and religious undertones as when he writes \u201c You say you want a Leader, but you can\u2019t seem to make up your mind. I think you better close it and let me guide you through the Purple Rain\u201d. The purple rain is the healing medicine if you will. ",
