            "answer_text": "Well, a computer is equipment. An audio and MIDI interface are equipment. A MIDI controller is equipment. Your monitors or cans are equipment. So, technically, no\u2026you will need equipment. However, if you're asking can you do it all \u201cin the box\" meaning no hardware synthesizers, samplers, effects, or conditioners, then: yes. Absolutely. People who do Trance do it every day. Even with vocals, they just get the vocalist to record those on their end and send the file to the producer. Now, does everybody do it that way? No. Many top producers use a mix of hardware and software. Do I do it that way? No. I have some hardware that I won't replace with plugins. I'm stubborn that way and I still think they sound way better. But those days aren't going to be forever. One day, even geezers like me will go the \u201cin the box\" route. It's just where things are headed. Edit: A couple of years ago, as a proof of concept, I started creating a few tracks using a DAW made for Android phones. Completely in the box, no external hardware, no soft synths not included with the application, no mastering by someone else on an analog board, completely in the box with the box being an Android phone. I only used the samples that it comes with (only for percussion, anyway), made my own patches on the softsynths built into it, and mastered and uploaded for publishing directly from the same $5 DAW. The results were very impressive (I'm not saying they're musically impressive, though one or two are up there with my best work), but from a production standpoint, I think they are as good as you'll get from big, expensive PC packages. $5. The DAW is Caustic. This is a link to my Spotify page and I've also included a direct link to my favorite (it's long and takes awhile to get there, but it pays off if you listen the whole way through). It's Shattered Consciousness. The rest are Cellular Evolution, Magnesium, and Schwarzschild. Listen, and you tell me if you need equipment! Brian McCalla Shattered Consciousness ",

Just don\u2019t crack and use FL or Ableton, use the freeware DAW\u2019s like LMMS (I use it myself). Within no time you\u2019ll make it to records, like I did, without any external hardware, but just a pair of Speakers and the computer of course. Good luck! ",
