            "answer_text": "Their past. They've gone through so many struggles, dating all the way back to predebut. Seokjin was ridiculed early on for his voice, because he hadn't had any experience going into the industry. He had wanted to be an actor when he was scouted for his looks, and put into BTS only to be the one with the least lines, least screan time, and as a result being ridiculed for being useless, only being there for his looks. He was also dubbed as the worst dancer. But this didnt make him give up or quit. Instead he spent hours extra working on his voice and dancing, and even still it isnt fully appreciated or recognized by critics. Yoongi had it arguably the worst. From when he had first started writing songs in his early teens, his family didn't support him. He moved to Seol and would be scammed out of his songs, setting up deals with people and they steal the songs and dont pay him. He often skipped meals because he didnt have the money for both food and a bus ticket home. He joined Big Hit despite his social anxiety and was put into what he thought was going to be a hip hop group bur turned out to be an idol group. Hw got hit by a car and messed up his shoulder perminantly but didnt say anything to Big Hit out of fear he would be kicked out. It hurt (and still does sometimes) during choreography. He was also heavily ridiculed by hia previous friends and collefues for \u201cabandoning hip hop\u201d and becoming an idol. ALL WHILE STRUGGLING WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (see Agust D's The Last for reference) Hoseok, though he doesnt express it, was put under extreme pressure to be the happy one, the moos setter. He felt pressure to always be \u201cour hope, our Angel\u201d that he never let himself express his begative emotions, bottling then up. He also, when he was signed, had no past in rap and wanted to be a vocalist. He couldnt rap *at ALL* thus spent hours upon hours studying and practicing alone and with Yoongi trying to learn an entirely new skill, often skipping meals and sleep to practice more. Namjoon had also been part of the underground scene and was heavily ridiculed for leaving. His previous friends and collegues all judged him and hated on him for \u201cabandoning hip hop\u201d like Yoongi. He also struggled a lot with fitting into the new crowd of idols because he didn't look like an idol. He wasnt the ~picture perfect~ Korean man, and was therefore also shunned from the industry. Like Seokjin, he also couldnt dance as well as the others and was often made fun of and was the butt of a lot of jokes and harassment because of his lack of inate talent dancing. He too spent extra hours, forgoing sleep in order to improve. Jimin's predebut life wasnt awful. He was actually a very happy and talented boy. But once he debuted, he was known for his abs and muscles (bc of No More Dream). He became very attuned to public opinion of him and that drove him to anxiety and depression, anorexia following. He would live in the practice room, always the perfectionist, even the smallest flaw made him practice that much harder, driving him to exhaustion and malnourishment, often fainting during practice. This is the reason for his dramatic physical change between the debut eras (muscular) and Wings era (petit and dainty - almost frail) Taehyung hasn't explicitly stated any hardships of his own, growing up on a farm and accidentally auditioning for Big Hit when he went to support his friend. However, after debut he was often made fun of because of his unique personality, called \u201calien\u201d, mayne affectionately by the members, but others did it much less friendly. He also had a lot of pressure for being a mood setter, quite like Hoseok. Bottling up his own negative emotions in order to only show his positive kr sttrange sides. Jungkook's struggles come from his members'. As he joined *very young*, BTS practically raised him. He grew up in the industry, making him miss out on all the things kids and teens normally do, in return for years of scrutiny and judgement. He has stated ina few interviews (around Wings era) that he doesnt struggle on his own, but when his brothers struggle it\u201d's that much harder for him because BTS is literally his whole life. So all the strugfles that the others went through impacted Jungkook deeply, as well as his status as the Golden Maknae, putting pressure on him to always be the best at everything he does. Sorry this turned out way longer than i intended, but I needed to rant a bit ",

            "answer_text": "It is unfortunate to say that to my knowledge,it has to do with the IDOL-FAN RELATIONSHIP or service,however you like to call it. A fellow Quora by the profile name Random Person wrote a brilliant answer to this question and I couldn\u2019t agree more. It\u2019s a very toxic kind of relationship and I\u2019m ashamed to even admit that at some point in my life, I developed an obsessive addiction towards them and was lying to myself that this was real love and the feelings were in fact mutual until I did some research into the industry and realized how manipulative and psychologically damaging it does to the fans in ways many young fans are not noticing until it becomes too late and lead to saesang fans. This is the biggest difference between western artists and K-POP idols.Idols are used to fulfill fantasies and distort the culture of what\u2019s real and fake for the whole purpose of making money from fans. It is very very sad that in the end some of these idols unfortunately become overwhelmed with their idol images and constantly being used by both fans and the company that they eventually commit s$icy@de once their fame dies down or can\u2019t cope anymore. Ever wondered why in the west,celebs can date and marry publicly and still have a successful career but in K-POP idols have to hide,it\u2019s because they are selling the fans a product to feed into a fantasy.They lie to the fans and are lying to themselves and I don\u2019t blame them fully but part as the company decides who does this or that.They all know exactly what they are doing and are aware of how toxic this idol-fan relationship is for everyone.FAKE LOVE,Outro:HER and Outro:TEAR,The Truth Untold are songs that depicts this kind of toxic relationship between BTS and the fan service and very few have noticed the pattern by taking time to read the lyrics instead of just bopping to it and claiming how great the songs are when in fact they are forgetting the msg. Most of the fans need to read the real life story about an obsessive fan who thought she was in love with the late David Cassidy and know how this fan needed serious therapy to overcome this obsession. OVERCOMING CELEBRITY OBSESSION by Diane Saks is the title  and go into the mind of an obsessive fan,they\u2019ll realize most of the fans suffer the same symptoms she did and seek help before it\u2019s too late. I own the book and it was a good wake up call to take a step back from BTS and see K-POP for what it is.The music is great sometimes and they give awesome performances,anything outside of the music is all fallacies.
