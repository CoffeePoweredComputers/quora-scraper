            "answer_text": "Eminem's peak was when he first started in 1999 releasing classic albums like Slim Shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show which was 2002  then after his fourth album Encore (2004) his music quality started declining although some of the songs from this album were good (Mockingbird, Like Toy Soldiers) but most of the album was pretty underwhelming for artist of Eminem's calibre  then he took a hiatus upto 2009 when he released Relapse, it was not well recieved by casual hip hop fans and critics which further added to \u201cEminem's music quality declining\u201d. Eminem himself stated that he cringes whenever he hears Relapse (although now it became a cult classic album for fans)  then in 2010 he released his album Recovery which was well recieved by critics and fans but it had lot of pop features which made some hip hop fans hate it stating Eminem went pop and not qualifying it as a real rap  then in 2013 he released his moist awaited album Marshall Mathers LP 2 it was an improvement from his last 3 albums critics loved it fans loved it even more but it had pop features as well which made some hip hop fans annoyed a bit but overall it was a well recieved album  then Eminem took hiatus for 4 years now this album Revival it was paned by critics and his fans also stated it was an underwhelming project he gathered a lot of hate for this album  which made Eminem to make another album Kamikaze throwing shots at critics and his haters and mumble rap even tho the album was recieved ok people still stated his music quality has declined drastically stating he always looks mad in his latest album and is cringey and is old head that doesn't understand the current state of hip hop  In 2020 he released his latest album \u2018Music to be murdered by\u2019 which again wasn't well recieved by critics and casual fans while critics stated that it was an improvement from his last 2 albums it still wasn't near mmlp, tes or sslp.  Overall my answer to your question is that Eminem isn't young anymore and his peak has been over for a quite long time now and many new generation artist are making quality music like Kendrick Lamar and J cole to name a few that's why he isn't the best out right now but still he's one of the goats in the game.

            "answer_text": "Eminem was the greatest rapper during the previous decade, however his style was mainly rapping and as the tears went by newer artists came, and eventually newer forms of music came into play, which somehow made Eminem's music obsolete. Currently, people are more inclined to rap mixed with other genres like R.B and Rock music, and it was difficult for him to adapt to this change in hippop culture. The current generation's preferences lie in artists like Travis Scott, Drake and other new age rappers who don't entirely focus on lyrics, but also on beats, variations in flows and mixing various technologies like autotune in their music. Since Eminem never adapted, he lost the top position, but still many rappers and the general public including I think that Eminem will be one of the greatest rappers of all time. ",
