            "answer_text": "Loads of people have sung songs called Gloria but there\u2019s only one for me, the G-L-O-R-I-A one by Them from Belfast, sung by Van Morrison and written when he was 18.  The B-side of Baby Please Don\u2019t Go It was a Garage Rock staple in the 60s, notably covered by the Shadows of Knight who had the 1966 U.S. hit but their cover doesn\u2019t have the agression of the original and has slightly different lyrics.  She doesn\u2019t come to my Room on this version Part of the reason why the Shadows of Knight version went Top 10 was censorship, it was competing with Them\u2019s version which was banned in several local markets due to the scandalous\u201cshe comes to my room\u201d line and only managed #71. The Shadows of Knight version had \u201cshe called my name\u201d and therefore didn\u2019t have the sex implied in the original Them version. Another garage band and early Texan psychedelic rock band The 13th Floor Elevators also featured it live as did several other garage bands and this follows the Them model.  As did the Doors, who saw Them at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go and played it live between 1968 & \u201970 and who strangely also managed to chart a version at US #71 in 1983.  Bon Scott recorded it with his pre AC/DC group the Spektors, ACDC included it in their live set early on and recorded the not dissimilar Jailbreak, Save Me by Aretha is a very close cousin as is Instant Groove by King Curtis.  Gloria But the best cover is by Patti Smith who totally reimagined Gloria as the opening track of her 1975 debut album Horses, first quoting a line from her poem Oath \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins but not mine\u201d declaring her freedom from her organised religious upbringing and then using the song as a shamanistic vehicle of escape. This may seem a big step from the original meaning of the song which is more a declaration of sexual freedom but both songs are in essence about the freedom of self and the transition from teenage to adult. Bruce Springsteen, Eddie & the Hot Rods, R.E.M. Grateful Dead, Joe Strummers 101ers, David Bowie & 100s of others have been declaring Gloria\u2019s freedom since 1964.  Van has said the song is named after an older cousin Gloria but is not about her. According to Erik Hage in The Words and Music of Van Morrison. Gloria, who became Gloria Gordon, died of cancer at age 29, three years before Van Morrison and his group Them would record the famous 1964 rock song that he named after her Hear Van Morrison's Raw, Early 'Gloria' Demo With Them ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to a pop music song by that title, there are at least two songs I am aware of with the title \u201cGloria\"\u2026 one was written by singer songwriter Van Morrison and was recorded by his band Them in 1964\u2026 it is discernible by the chorus line actually spelling out the word \u201cG-L-O-R-I-A\"\u2026 the other is the one that automatically came to my mind, \u201cGloria\" made famous in 1982 by Laura Brannigan\u2026 it might be the one you are referring to because it was originally written and recorded by an Italian singer named Umberto Tozzi\u2026 Mr Tozzi sang the song in Italian and it was a huge hit staying on the Italian Top 10 chart for sixteen weeks, six of them at the number 2 spot.
