            "answer_text": "Caroline Zelonka answered this almost perfectly - I\u2019d just like to add my perspectives. I started college in 1992 - the year after grunge broke, and the scope of \u201cchange\u201d that it brought with it was a LOT more than just music. My background: lived in Bellingham, a college bedroom community 80-miles north of Seattle. Most of the college kids who go there are from the Seattle area, and I visited Seattle regularly. So I was peripherally connected in some way to the \u201cscene\u201d, but not part of it. But I \u201cdid the 90\u2019s\u201d I guess, lived in the PNW, and remember the feel of the era. Grunge music was around for a decade before it got popular in late 1991. Overnight it displaced mainstream rock, so badly that you\u2019d literally get laughed at for listening to music that had been \u201cpopular\u201d only 2 years before. It was definitely a reflection of change - and it happened FAST. Like Caroline said, growing up in the 1980\u2019s we were ALL immersed in images of wealth, success, and easy living. I remember my high-school & later college guidance counselors basically telling students \u201cdo this, study that, get this degree, and you\u2019ll make really great money doing X, Y, or Z\u201d\u2026.and we believed it, because we were too young to know the difference. ALL OF THAT DISAPPEARED. Or more correctly, it was propaganda to begin with, and those same authority figures who had basically setup this roadmap for success went silent about how to achieve it. Basically, the \u201coptimism\u201d about the American Dream died. Now, there\u2019s a LOT said about how rock was all mainstream garbage, which is why grunge displaced it. There\u2019s some truth to that, but I wasn\u2019t hearing a lot of complaints from \u201caverage\u201d kids at the time. I think something more true is to say that mainstream American rock represented a commercialized vision of the status quo that was totally out of touch with the 90\u2019s. The thing is, you CAN\u2019T just look grunge music by itself. You had a bunch of trends at the time: in the movies, you\u2019ve got \u201cClerks\u201d, \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d, and \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d - along with TV shows like the X-files, clothing trends going hard-core thrift-store, etc\u2026 Looking back, this whole period was transitional - I\u2019d say 1991 to 1995. Grunge purists say that the scene was already over then, but for the average kid of that era, you\u2019re talking about a period of about 4 years. What changed was the advent of the Internet - what you MUST remember is that information didn\u2019t travel instantly back then. Kids got \u201cinto\u201d grunge music from the radio, their friends, and MTV (I vaguely recall getting laid with the Kobain unplugged concert going in the background). It took a while for this social trend to percolate into society. Same thing with the tail-end of things. I was \u201con\u201d the internet (via America Online\u2019s web-browser) in 1994, but the CNN announcements about it in \u201995 really marked the start of popular consciousness about the idea. Then, it became a race to develop & deploy the next big money-making website, and everything changed yet again. In any case, grunge was driven the music industry marketing machine - and those don\u2019t seem highly effective like they used to be. I think today\u2019s world is too decentralized for them to function like they used to. Also, grunge was a reaction to a realization across the board that Gen-X had been lied to, and I think that today\u2019s youth have grown up KNOWING that they\u2019ve been lied to, so there\u2019s nothing really to have that sort of shocked reaction to.

            "answer_text": "With the advent of the synthesizer and digital production tools in the 80s, rock music was starting to get incredibly overproduced. Add to that a general level of visual excess. Remember the hair bands of the 80s? Christ on a cracker, these guys must have taken hours to get ready, what with the perms, hairspray, makeup, spandex pants etc. etc. The pendulum had to swing the other way. Rock had lost its \"realness;\" it was all about overproduction and showmanship. Grunge bands represented the opposite. It was raw, it wasn't fussy, the musicians dressed like regular people \u2014 in Seattle, anyway. I can say that because I was one of those regular Seattle people. I was lucky enough to be a witness to the emergence of grunge at its epicenter. Several of these bands, like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam (aka Mother Love Bone), Mudhoney \u2014 had been popular locally for quite awhile. It was a little jarring when they started becoming world-famous, actually. And I'll admit, I didn't care for a lot of the super-popular bands (like Nirvana and Alice In Chains) at first. But after a minor setback that felt major as a 22 year old, I did start to like them, and came to a realization. Grunge music sounds really good when you're pissed off. And many young white adults had a lot to be pissed off about in the early 90s. Growing up in the 80s, Generation X was immersed in images of wealth and success. Being rich and privileged was a huge part of popular culture, huge huge huge. This was the era of Dallas, Dynasty, Ronald fucking Reagan, Donald fucking Trump, The Yuppie Handbook, The Preppie Handbook, and all the teen movies where the rich kids were always the most popular and desirable. James Spader in a polo shirt was like, an idol,. Yes, we also had punk rockers, goths, headbangers, Deadheads, and nerds, but the dominant aesthetic (among white middle class folk) was the rich preppie look. Go to any large high school at the time and you'd mainly see kids in khakis, polo shirts, boat shoes, pearls and such. Because culture worshipped wealthy douchebags, teens wanted to become wealthy douchebags. Because teens have no perspective, most assumed that if they studied hard, got into a good college and graduated, they'd be pretty much guaranteed a plush \"yuppie\" lifestyle, starting with a highly-paid \"career track\" job in some prestigious company. That's what our parents and teachers had led us to believe, and given the country's long track record of prosperity, they didn't have much perspective either. Of course, the dream did happen for people in tech, but in the late 80s, being a \"computer nerd\" was not fashionable. And besides, the majority of people had little to no access to personal computers back then, much less formal training on how to use them. Then, in October 1987, the Dow Jones Average collapsed. An unprecedented 22.6% drop, larger than that of 1929[1]. Add to that the savings and loan crisis, and by the time many of our generation graduated in the early 90s, the job market evaporated. Suddenly, these bright, hardworking, future Blake Carringtons were faced with an uncertain future. Newly-minted MBAs found themselves forced to \"pull espresso\" (ah, the good old days of the independent coffeehouse) or find other McJobs[2]. People had to move in with their parents, or stay in the cheap shared apartments they were living in while working toward a dream that had been cruelly taken away from them. It seems almost laughable now, in light of so much economic turmoil we've experienced since then, but as I said, we didn't have much perspective. And we were pissed! We wanted to vent our rage, and we couldn't relate anymore to the decadent and overproduced music of the 80s. The grunge movement started in Seattle, and quickly spread throughout the country and then the world. As the economy heated up in the late 90s, the grunge scene cooled off (being taken over somewhat by hip hop and rap, though I don't have a thesis as to how this evolved.)
