            "answer_text": "The free version of Zoom limits you to a 40 minute meeting. On top of that, you won\u2019t be able to record your meeting, either. Should you wish to go with the Zoom Pro option, those limits would be removed, but it does cost $14.99 per month to use. If you have an .edu Gmail account (i.e. teacher or student) a good free alternative is Google Meet.[1] If not, your best bet would then be Skype. No limits there, either. **Update** In light of the recent coronavirus issues, Zoom has removed their time limits on basic accounts for the time being. There is now NO limit to the amount of time you can conference for! Footnotes[1] Meet",
