            "answer_text": "Adds a great deal of fun to it. ;) Adding an article I had recently come across which I think would perfectly answer your question. The Adventure of Your Life Life is supposed to be a series of adventures. It's impossible to understand the meaning of life without understanding that. We're all supposed to be explorers, pioneers, and treasure hunters of the soul. We're not supposed to be sleep walking through the world, caught in a routine, heads down and eyes closed to the possibilities that lie waiting all around us. This world is a dramatic arena, and each of our lives is supposed to show that in the best possible way. \"Without adventure, civilization is in full decay.\" (Alfred North Whitehead) I've become convinced that we are here in this world to live a grand adventure consisting of a series of smaller adventures. We are here for discovery, growth, creative accomplishment, and loving fulfillment. Anything less is a waste of time.Whether your adventure is noisy and glamorous, or subtle and deep, whether it plays out on a global stage, or within the borders of your own neighborhood, whether it involves changing the world, or just improving yourself, an adventurous approach to life is a requirement for becoming the person you're capable of being, making your mark in the lives of others, and experiencing a sense of lasting fulfillment along the way. I choose the word 'adventure' carefully. It's more than just a journey that I have in mind, a process of travelling from point A to B. An adventure is an extended experience, frought with risk and reward, unpredictable twists, guaranteed obstacles, and surprising results. You can take a trip, launch out on a voyage, or undergo a journey fast asleep. But an adventure has to be experienced. Eyes wide open. In disbelief, terror, amazement, or bliss. It is an essentially existential endeavor, a foray of the heart, mind and senses that calls into play every aspect of your existence. The term 'adventure' is in a sense value neutral. An adventure can be frightening, or it can be great. It can cause pain, or produce joy. It can end badly or well. But you never experience an adventure unchanged. In fact, adventure is all about change. It's about growth. And growth is the core of life. Successful lives grow out of successful adventures. The adventure of your life is so important that it demands the best of your attention, and the most of your energies, on a daily basis, so that it can be lived well. The world's greatest literature attests in many ways to the paradigmatic importance of adventure in human life. In the Iliad and the Odessey, the ancient poet Homer spun tales of striking adventures that have reverberated down the centuries, capturing the interest of people in every subsequent time. In the book of Genesis, one of the foundational stories of the Bible, an account viewed as of crucial importance by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, presents Abram as a man suddenly called out of the comfort and security of his homeland for a new adventure, a journey that would eventually lead him to The Promised Land. Renamed Abraham, this adventurer is viewed as the original Father of faith, and as an individual through whom all the nations will eventually be blessed. \"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go.\" (Hebrews 11:8, New Testament) The Buddha went on a quest. Mohammed lived an adventure. Moses, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Columbus, Gandhi, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, Martin Luther King - so many of the names that represent to us lives fully lived are those of adventurers, inventors, discoverers, liberators, creators, people who were not content to just measure out their days, but who threw themselves into a dynamic process of change for the sake of others as well as themselves. We're fascinated and inspired by mountain climbers, sailors on the open sea, serious rafters, hot air baloonists, scuba divers, spelunkers, astronauts, and pioneers of every kind. We admire those among us who are able to break out of their routines and take the risks involved in all discovery. And, in more subtle ways, we read with interest and satisfaction the stories to be found in great novels of character challenge, emotional learning, and personal growth. Adventures of exploration and conquest, as well as adventures of the heart, have dominated the human imagination at all times. Deep down we've somehow always known that life is meant to encompass challenging adventures, We've even suspected that human existence reaches its pinnacle in creative adventure, and yet this is an insight we too easily forget to apply to our own careers in this world. We might dream of fabulous adventures in our innermost thoughts, but thrown into an actual one, we often react with anxiety, aversion and fear. \"When you\u00b9re safe at home you wish you were having an adventure; when you\u00b9re having an adventure you wish you were safe at home.\" (Thornton Wilder)We live in what could be the most adventure filled time of change in all of human history, but we have not been sufficiently prepared for living that adventure well. We don't deeply enough understand the necessity of personal adventure for the happiness and fulfillment that we all ultimately seek. We need new wisdom for our lives at a time like this. And wisdom is the philosopher's job. Source :http://www.morrisinstitute.com/index.php?s=wisdom&c=weekly_adventure ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve ever thought about adventure travel theme for your next vacation, then there are many reasons to go ahead and take the leap. If you really need an excuse, adventure travel offers numerous physical and mental health benefits. Adventure sport is a bold undertaking, which is an exciting and unusual experience. Adventure sports are undertaken at various places depending on nature, topography, and the weather conditions. Each sport location differs from the other. Activities like skiing and sledding can be done on the snow-covered area, while mountaineering and rock climbing can be done in hilly areas.  Here\u2019s why adventure sums up your life. 1. Improve your immune system Adventure travel usually gives you an opportunity to get a little dirty. Whether you\u2019re on a biking tour to Ladakh, camel riding through the Thar Desert, or rock climbing in Thailand, you\u2019re bound to get dirty, which can help improve your immunity. As per researchers, our society\u2019s obsession with cleanliness is increasing day by day, leading to a rise in allergies, asthma, and even inflammatory bowel disease. Getting dirty helps to build a stronger immune system, which helps to fight most of the diseases. 2. Stay mentally sharp  Any new experience and activity can help you grow mentally, with physical activities like Hiking, mountaineering, and biking helping to grow the hippocampus. While doing adventure activities, you can encounter a lot of people from different parts of the world, which highly helps to grow your knowledge regarding many aspects of life. 3. Boost self-confidence Adventure Travel boost self-confidence, allowing one to become immersed in unknown territory causes an internal shift in our confidence level. Each adventurous experience builds more confidence, as it challenges you a bit more, every time. Anytime you go for a daring activity or something new, it gives you more strength, enthusiasm, and confidence. 4. Spark the desire to explore Our busy life seems to be extinguishing the childhood desire to explore. Participation in adventurous activities has been on the decline, and work life has made people form a particular routine, with the desire to explore vanishing over time. However, trekking can spark the desire to explore, and happiness can never be compared to any routine or material possession. 5. Active Adventures Reduce Stress  Have you ever wondered why trekkers have a smile on their face when they return home? It\u2019s because they\u2019re happier after it! It\u2019s been scientifically proven that adventure helps to reduce stress. A disconnect from your usual environment allows you to see things in a different and refreshed perspective. This not only reduces your level of stress, but allows you to handle stress more effectively when you\u2019re back at home. Go for an adventure, as these experiences would encourage you to psychologically and physically challenge yourself, making you confident and happier. Adventures have a way to bring people together and create bonds that last lifelong. Trekking boosts our overall zest for life, improves our self-awareness, and fosters a sense of life. This is what people refer to when they say that adventure travel has allowed them to rediscover their inner self. ",
