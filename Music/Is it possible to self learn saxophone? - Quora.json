            "answer_text": "Yes I think it is possible to self teach one to play the saxophone. You see, I am talking from personal experience. Since my early days as a very young boy, I was and still is, extremely fascinated by the sound of the jazz saxophone. I clearly remember the very first jazz saxophone music I heard on my 14th year birthday party. My folks were staunch jazz record collectors. Jazz music was all that was played on that day, at that unforgettable event. I surely got hooked. Many great jazz saxophonists, including the likes of Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane, Ben Webster, Cannonball Ardeley, Gene Ammons, Pepper Adams, Coleman Hawkins, Sonny Rollins, Yusef Lateef, Stanley Turrentine, Charles Lloyd, Grover Washington and many modern saxophonists that includes Joshua Redman, Branford Marsalis, James Carter, Kirk Whalum and many others - silently but surely influenced my desire and hunger to learn how to play this lovely musical instrument. My biggest challenge then was, how was I going to do that ? Who was going to teach me to play ? Did I wanted to stop my chosen career as an entrepreneur and enrol in a musical college ? If i did, who was going to look after all those that depended on me to put food on the table ? (my family, some of my under-privileged relatives, my employees and my own financial needs). I just couldn't quit my day job and go enrol at a music school. I also didn't want to commission a fully fledged musician to teach me. Believe you me, I do boast a few established jazz saxophonist on my list of friends. I doubt anyone among them would have turned their backs on me if I had shouted out for their help. Problem is, I am too self driven. Always in competition with myself. Once I set my mind on anything, I do not stop until it's done. The spirit of \u201cJAZZISM\u201d flows in my blood I am highly enthusiastic about conquering the art of playing the saxophone. I want to create my own jazz identity and make my own mistakes without anyone's influences. My gigantic confidence and self belief (and probably my notorious lousy pride) propelled me to buy my first new horn with the aim of teaching myself. I remember the first time I handled this new instrument, fresh from its case, I didn't even know how to assembled it. It took me a few minutes to figure everything out. I could not even tell the difference between a mouth piece from a neck. Hahahaha. I was a joke of my family everytime I tried to blow out a note. That was a few years ago, 5 to be precise. My playing has moved forward three steps, 19 million steps still to undertake. I must say that I received my encouragement to carry on teaching myself to play from research, readings and quotes by most of the above mentioned musicians (Presently I am researching and compiling a long list of these quotes which I intend to later publish into a jazz picture and history book). Truth be told, it was and still is not easy to teach myself. Its hard which is also pleasant work. Work i dearly enjoy doing. I keep on practising for as much as I can, on a daily basis. I practice when ever I get a chance. One of my favourite players, the legendary Mr Sonny Rollins, was well renowned for taking his horn everywhere he goes, just to practice at the slightest chance he got. He was also famous for spending long hours everyday at the \u201cbridge\u201d. It is also rumoured that the great - the master, John Coltrane used to lock himself up in his music room for many hours, practising his horns non-stop. I am proud to say I have been invited to jam with seasoned jazz artists on several occasions. I have played solo to many people at various venues. I get invites to play solo at peoples functions. I must also admit that my playing is still like a baby learning to crawl, still at its infancy. I still have many miles to walk before I can proudly declare myself a jazz player. The only way to keep on improving my playing, my jazz style, my own identity, is to keep on practising. Practice. ..practice. ..practice. Never stop. It is said one can never be perfect in playing, but one can master his or her instrument. The only regret I have is that I should have started playing the saxophone earlier in life and not in my 60s. But as they say, it's never too late to learn. Currently I own four saxophones: 3 altos and 1 soprano. I love them all. I try to practice each one at least once per week. I invest a lot of money in other saxophone accessories (neck-traps, mouthpieces, reeds etc). I do not read or write music as yet. I play from the heart. I play what I feel. I allow the melodies to come to me. I don't play the horn, I let the horn play me. Playing the saxophone is the best thing ever to happen to me. It brings me so much joy. Playing totally takes me to another world. I am in love with the saxophone. My next journey will be to enrol at a good jazz music school. This is earmarked for mid 2018. Yes, it is possible to teach oneself to play the saxophone if you have the love for its sound,if you are determined to achieve your set objective, if you are brave enough to develop that \u201cgo getter\u201d attitude and if you are willing to sacrifice the long hours of fiddling with the horn, of researching, reading, attending live concerts, listening to your favourite music artists and so on. Be prepared to give it your all, your everything. It is not supposed to be easy but it's doable. If others can do it, why can't you ? I don't know how much you want to learn by self teaching but i know that once you start, you won't want to stop. Lastly, as a word of advice, it's best to invest in a good music school, if you can. It will be money well spent. \u201c Nothing great in the world was accomplished without passion \u201c - G.W.F. Hegel Menziani on Soprano and on alto.   ",

            "answer_text": "YES !! It is more than possible to self learn the saxophone ! Just like anything in life, you can teach yourself pretty much anything these days. The internet is an amazing resource. Websites such as Youtube, Udemy, Skillshare and a whole host of others will show you everything you need to know, and more. A few things to keep in mind: You will need a saxophone !! Rent / Beg / Borrow / Buy (but please don\u2019t steal !!) a sax. No amount of watching videos about learning how to play the saxophone will help if you don\u2019t actually have one.Play the kind of music that YOU want to play. There is nothing more demoralising than learning classical music if you are into heavy metal\u2026and vice versa. If you aren\u2019t inspired then you will soon give up.You will need to actually play your saxophone. Regularly. Unfortunately, learning a musical instrument takes time. Playing your saxophone for 5 or 10 minutes a day is much better than playing for 30 or 45 or 60 minutes once a week. If you do this for a month or two or three then you WILL be able to honk your sax in a way that is actually pleasing to your ear. You will hear yourself progress.Make sure that you have fun with your saxophone. As per 2. above, if it\u2019s a chore and a pain then it is unlikely that you will persist long enough to achieve your musical goals.Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. Decide early on on what your musical goals might be. If you want to be a rock star - go for it !! If you want to be a jazz legend or join the state symphony orchestra, then go for it ! If you just want to be a bedroom warrior, then go for that too !! If your goal is to play one song at a friends birthday party, then learn your song and have fun at the party :-) There is no right or wrong with learning how to play the saxophone. You do you !An in person teacher will arguably be the shortest route to success. However they are most likely be expensive. This is obviously not a problem if you have the funds available for your new hobby. However, make sure that you find one that wants to help you play what YOU want to play, rather than what THEY want you to play. Online saxophone lessons are significantly cheaper, but just as good. You can easily find a website or lessons or a teacher that will help you on your way to becoming the saxophonist that you want to be. I hope this helps, Thanks, Matthew ",
