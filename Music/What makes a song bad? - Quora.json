            "answer_text": "So there are some objective measures of this. Excessive repetition is one way, however lack of repetition is another. In order for a theme to be developed, repetition is necessary, however many pop singers feel the need to repeat the same two bars over and over again. Another is dissatisfactory harmony. Ie. A song that ends on vi, or pretty much anything other than I. A song with no dissonance at all will bad bland, because there are no tensions being resolved, the piece will not grab or satisfy listeners, and you risk falling to the background. This is why mozart works well as study music and Beethoven not so much, Beethoven is very dissonant where as Mozart is easy to listen to. Dissonance is crucial in creating a piece of music. There are definitely subjective things some people don\u2019t like. \u201cNasally\u201d singing has been mentioned, the female equivalent is really breathy singing, a lot of sopranos do it to the point where it is now a cliche. The context of the album can make a song bad too. For instance, listening to one \u201cChainsmokers\u201d song might give you the impression that they are a decent group, until you spin the record and realize that all of their other songs are the same thing. That being said, it is hard to consider any song \u201cBad\u201d for those reasons alone. Are the chainsmokers bad? Sure, its repetetive drivel, but how can I possibly know that their music doesn\u2019t speak to other people like Beethoven speaks to me. We spend our entire lives with ourself, so its hard to recognize our biases and respect art. Most pop music regardless of how we feel about the lyrics has a cadence, and a pattern, and if that speaks to people, especially in numbers like Ed Sheeran pulls, then I can\u2019t call it a \u201cBad song\u201d. Tl;DR Lack of predictability, too much predictability, the same as everything else on your album. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is subjective and I wholeheartedly think there's no logical reason music reviews should sway your opinion on a track/record. Yet, they do. A lot. Music critics and reviewers who claim something is \u201cbad\u201d, are not exempt from psychology. These people have specific tastes and even when they try to rid themselves of their biases, it's impossible. The only way we could accurately review music and put a \u201cnumber rating\u201d, like 0\u20135/5 or 0\u201310/10, is if we used a computer to process it. When someone else says music is bad, and then you go ahead and listen to the song to see if it's bad, your brain primes you to ask the question: is this bad? And at that point, the song they're talking about and the song you are now listening to has to be above average or youre likely to agree with the critic. This is in part due to your ego trying to make you think you know what good and bad music is. It can also be the opposite way. You might seek music that people generally dislike in an effort to stick out or consider yourself above average in your ability to interpret music. Either way, the integrity of music can't be measured effectively. without some bias. You can kind of measure this by comparing it to songs that hit the charts or by comparing it to classic songs that the public has deemed \u201cclassics\u201d (normally just old songs that were considered popular at the time). It's all about your ego. Anyone can find any kind of music pleasant so claiming music as bad or good simply does more harm than good, because there are people who might enjoy all kinds of music until a person of influence deema it \u201cbad\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Preference and taste. Pick a really bad song. I bet someone likes it. No matter how bad a song is, there are people who like it. It comes down to individual preference in music. Perhaps conditioning plays a part too. Pop songs these days follow certain formulas and if lots of people like them, it must mean that\u2019s what good music sounds like. Repetitive songs that are easy to remember are quite popular. Preference in music, therefore, can be swayed. So when there is a song that doesn\u2019t follow a formula or is different from \u201cgood music\u201d, it is often seen as a bad song. Haven\u2019t you ever listened to a song the first time and thought it was bad but after listening to the same some a bunch of times, it grew on you and you liked it? Repetitive listening of certain styles of music can make your preference lean toward those types of songs as well. ",

I\u2019m pretty picky; I don\u2019t like nearly any of today\u2019s \u201cpop\u201d music. I don\u2019t like repetitive, silly lyrics. I don\u2019t like thumping, \u201chit-you-over-the-head\u201d backbeats or repetitive rhythm figures. I don\u2019t want to struggle to understand the lyrics. However, lots of people seem to like those very things. I don\u2019t know how many times on the old American Bandstand show some youngster would give his mini review\u2014\u201dWell, it\u2019s got a good beat and you can dance to it.\u201d Enough for him, not for me. To me, some of the worst pop music ever turned out was during the so-called disco era. Vapid lyrics (that were for the most part just parts of the rythym), thump-thump-thump backbeats (\u201cmusic even white people can dance to\u201d) and even worse; no guitars. ",

It\u2019s just designed to be repetitive and annoying enough to get stuck in one\u2019s head, eventually breaking down any resistance, causing folks to just wake up one day and like the song.

I also prefer the complex patterns of jazz and classical music, but I\u2019m a big fan of Fifth Harmony, Ariana Grande, and Selena Gomez.
