            "answer_text": "For the most part, it's due to high levels of dissonance and abstraction, which most people find ugly. Art in general got more and more abstract in the first half of the 20th century. Think of the paintings of Jackson Pollock, the writing of James Joyce, the experimental films that were produced. Music also reached a peak of complexity in the 50s and 60s. Dissonance levels were at their most intense, rhythms were orders of magnitude more complex than the fairly easy to grasp patterns previously common. Composition wasn't necessarily about creating an experience of beauty for the listener but often either an intellectual exercise or an expression of more modern concerns such as anguish and conflict ( after all, we had just had two world wars). Basically, the arts went about as far as they could go in terms of abstraction and then retrenched. For the representational arts, there was the natural world and the human form to provide grounding; for literature and drama, there was everyday language and the stories of human life that new generations will always find relevant. But music has no real natural basis to go back to. So composers have really struggled to find means of expression that are more relatable again without sounding old-fashioned or imitative of older styles. There is also a mania in the arts for originality. You are supposed to be a groundbreaking genius like a Beethoven or Wagner or Stravinsky who comes up with something revolutionary, not someone working within a long tradition and producing exemplary works within that tradition, while perhaps advancing it slightly with your personal style. Well, the former can't really be sustained forever. So now we have a contemporary music that appeals to a tiny number of people, while everyone else wants old music. It's exactly the opposite of what was the case for all of history until the late 19th-early 20th century. It really doesn't bode well for the future of classical music. ",

            "answer_text": "Contemporary classical music today is MUCH MORE accessible than 50\u201375 years ago, when atonality and 12-tone music was the focus of academia in the US and Europe. Atonal music is not based on diatonic harmony (major/minor), in fact atonal composers shunned diatonic methods. This music results in a constant dissonance and lack of a tonal center, with lack of recognizable melody, or feel, and lack of variety of mood. Even during the ascension of atonality, there were many composers who remained quite accessible: Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Howard Hanson, Alan Hovhaness, Carl Orff, Igor Stravinsky, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arvo Part, John Tavener\u2026 But by the \u201970s there began to be a shift away from atonality back to the natural overtone series and diatonic music. Things are not as arid today as they were then. Just listen to the music of Richard Danielpour, for example. He was a student of Vincent Persichetti, but recognized the need for diatonicism to communicate emotion. There were many other contemporary composers who are quite accessible today: Jennifer Higdon, Joan Tower, Morten Lauridsen, Cindy McTee, Jose Serebrier, Peter Boyer, Gerald Finzi, Alla Pavlova, James Whitmore, Eric Whitacre, Carter Pann, Missy Mazzoli\u2026 and just a whole lot of others. Happy Listening! ",
