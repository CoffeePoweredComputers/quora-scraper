            "answer_text": "To explain that, you need to see how music transformed my life. So, we\u2019ll start from the beginning\u2026 All the sudden I snapped. I wasn\u2019t me anymore, so I said some things I normally never would. The person\u2019s response triggered further collapse. I literally was having a full blown mental breakdown in public, and hid it. When I got into my car, I turned on some Christian music hoping for encouragement, and was so upset with God that it was painful to listen. So, I drove on in pain, believing that I\u2019d never feel normal again. I found writing poetry helped me process things. I shared it, because I wanted people to read it and find encouragement in knowing their not alone. It gave me a sense of purpose amidst a purpose killing illness. When I was criticized for it, that purpose pushed me further into feeling suicidal. It was then in the midst of shame, pain, feeling suicidal, I discovered the band Twenty One Pilots. \u201dI've got a migraineAnd my pain will range from up, down, and sidewaysThank God it's Friday'Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays'Cause Sundays are my suicide daysI don't know why they always seem so dismalThunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzleWhether it's the weather or the letters by my bedSometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head\u201c When I heard those words in their song Migraine, they broke through the shame and darkness. If Twenty One Pilots, a worldwide massively famous band, could sing about their insecurities, I too could write poetry. And I can share this: A Lie? I have the most amazing friends, Maybe if I was less of an idiot, I could see it: With them everything mends! Sometimes I almost want to die, What I think they mean kills me, Yet what they mean sets me free. Could I stop believing my lie? If I was right, What would become of me? I fear only someone else would see, Would my will want to fight? I wonder every night, There must be a better reason to live, In myself I cannot believe, I must stop lying about God\u2019s might. To say with logic I must, Jesus chose to die, So why believe a lie? Thus I trust.  So, because of a band. I didn\u2019t stop believing in God, my friends, or myself. I\u2019m still here. Depression stopped me from me from thinking straight, and musical broke through all of that. ",
