            "answer_text": "A vocoder works by taking a musical sound input and passing it through a multi-band dynamic EQ filter, synthesizing sound. It filters out certain frequencies and allows weird sounds to be produced by instruments, an instrumentalist can \u201csing\u201d with his instrument. (Similar to the voice box used for Framptons\u2019 guitar on \u201cdo you feel like I do\u201d) Or a voice can sound duplicated and shaded etc, like \u201cwell I remember\u201d background on Phil Collins \u201cIn the air Tonight.\u201d Or robotic as in many Daft Punk songs. Autotune works by pitch-shifting with a computer algorithm. It changes the frequency and sound wave to be the precise note needed. The Cher album in 1998 created a new way to use auto tune, when the producers discovered auto tune could create a robot effect when the note shifted too quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "No it\u2019s not, auto tune uses computer algorithms to analyse the audio signal and assuming that you\u2019ve set the key etc correctly makes the recorded voice be in tune, more extreme settings can result in the effect used in Cher\u2019s \u2018Believe \u201c single or more recent records. A vocoder uses an audio signal to modulate the input sound, usually in this case the human voice, popular examples of this are \u201cMr Blue Sky\u201d by ELO and I think the first example was a song called \u201cSparkys electric piano\u201d By modulating the signal we add a robotic quality to the voice, for the most effective application I have found a synthesised triangle wave to be best. So autotune helps people sing in tune. Vocoder helps them sing like robots. ",
