            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson started practicing Islam from earlier 2007. Eventually, the \"King of Pop\" reverted to Islam on 21st November, 2008 & converted to Muslim. But, Neil Syson spread the buzz with intricacy & made the conversion report complicated. Radical Analysis of Key Points \u2605In 2007, when it was asked from MJ's Muslim elder brother Jermaine Jackson (converted in 1989) at certain interview on USA, \u201cWe heard you would like your brother Michael to convert to Islam... Will he (MJ) convert?\u201d Jermaine replied, \u201cHe should, I hope so\u201d. \"Michael, I feel, needs to become a Muslimbecause I think it's a great protection for him from all the things that he's been attacked with, which are false. There's a strength and a protection there.\" Mail Online; January 30, 2007. \"When there can be nasty uproar against me when I became Muslim, why can it not be so against Michael Jackson. But, so far, media has not subjected him to scathing criticism, although he is threatened for his getting closer to Islam. But who knows what would it look like when Michael Jackson embraces Islam.\" Jermaine Jackson, USA (part 1 of 2); January 16, 2006. Then, on the day of sudden death of Michael Jackson, Jermaine fixed up a \u2018Press Conference\u2019 to announce to the world that Michael had deceased. At that brief News Conference in the auditorium of the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (evening), Jermaine Jackson sighed audibly several times before addressing reporters. \"This is hard,\u201d he said softly. \"My brother, the legendary king of pop, Michael Jackson, passed away on Thursday, June 25, 2009 at 2:26 p.m. It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest in his home. However, the cause of his death is unknown until results of the autopsy are done. His personal physician, who was with him at the time, attempted to resuscitate my brother. As did the paramedics who transmitted him to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Upon arriving at the hospital at approximately 1:14 p.m., a team of doctors including emergency physicians and cardiologists, attempted to resuscitate him for a period of more than one hour and they were unsuccessful. Our family requests that the media please respect our privacyduring this tough time.\" Conclusively, Jermaine implied: \"May Allah be with you, Michael, always.\" Jermaine Jackson's Press Conference Announcement of Michael Jackson's death; Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Evening, June 25, 2009. In another exclusive Dubai-based pan-Arab news channel \"Al-Arabiya TV\" interview, Jermaine intimated- \u201cHe (MJ) might made the declaration in his Soul, but at the same time we wanted to hear it\u201d... The Los Angeles Times; January 22, 2010. Jermaine Jackson believes his brother Michael was in the process of converting to Islam before his death in 2009. Remembering Michael from the deepest emotion of heart, Jermaine said in an interview to be broadcast on the BBC World Service, 2010 : \u201cI felt that if Michael would have embraced Islam he would still be here today and I say that for many reasons.... God is so powerful.\u201d Ultimately, Speaking from Moroccos Mawazine Festival in 2010, Jermaine Jackson said: Michael had been studying Islamic spiritual texts. \"I remember I came back from Saudi Arabia,.. Mosques, and I brought him [Michael] a bunch of books about Islam. One thing about Michael is that he reads everything. He read all the books, aboutsix of them, that I gave him. I do know that all of [Michael's] security and the people that took care of his children, became Muslim. As far as him accepting Islam in his heart, I am sure he did.\" This proclamation directly implies that Michael Jackson accepted Islam before his death and the report of MJ\u2019s conversion was 100% true. Reportedly, Yusuf Islam (former Cat Stevens) and Dawud Wharnsby (former David Wharnsby) were the eyewitnesses of Michael's conversion phenomenon took place in Los Angeles.. NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF JACKSON FAMILY EVER PROCLAIMED THAT MJ'S CONVERSION REPORT WAS FAKE. Numerous evidences were available those consolidated the truth of MJ'S conversion. Michael Jackson converted to Islam on 21st November, 2008 & took the name \"MIKAEL\" with reciting Shahadah.. News Media platforms- Times Now, Panorama, The Sun, GEO, Belief net etc. reported his religious conversion.Almost maximum conversant people admits the truth, except of a few mendacious vile who try to misguide public deliberately. These groupings adhere with their misleading purpose by perverting the reality, then purports their falsehood to be the right, e.g., \"WikiIslam\" (Anti-Islamic Magnet and a notorious site; created by a group of Islamphobes and damnable Ex-Muslims associated with \"F.F.I.\" in 2005; which posts false tidings and misinterprets every aspect of Islamic guidance 'Shariah' with a distinct Anti-Muslim bias). Michael's ancestral root was in \u201cBadagry\u201d a coastal town and local government area (LGA) in Lagos State, Nigeria. According to Jermaine Jackson- \u201cOriginally, they were Black Muslims when they first settled in North America during the slavery period.\u201d Successively, being influenced by his brother Jermaine, MJ went back to his root by the reversion. He found peacefulness, purity in Islam and no room of racism in this religion. That's why, he chose the path of Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali. Michael Jackson died as a Muslim. Surely Michael was buried as a Muslim. News also spread that Jackson family\u2019s consulting with an imam for his Islamic funeral & \u2018Salat al-Janazah\u2019, i.e., CNN... The true evidences imply that according to proofs. The bold truth is- THERE ARE NO OPEN CASKET PHOTO OF MJ AND HE WAS NEVER BEEN IN THAT PROMETHEAN CASKET!!.. Jackson's $25,000 casket was present during the memorial but no information was released about the final disposition of the body. The memorial service was one of the most watched events in streaming history, with an estimated U.S. audience of 31.1 million, an amount comparable to the estimated 35.1 million that watched the 2004 burial of former president Ronald Reagan and the estimated 33.1 million Americans who watched the 1997 funeral for Princess Diana. \u2734 Celebs like Elvis Presley, over stated highest watched Ronald Reagan, Princess Diana etc.- all of them had open casket photo and their dead body publicly brought to light. There funeral also publicly took place. In the case of MJ, his dead body was concealed in the memorial service also and there is no single proof that he was in that casket! Why they ordered 3 caskets there?.. And why were the Jackson brothers and the father at Muslim funeral showing true sad tears with the light blue casket that was meant to be for Michael Jackson. As the police said, \u201cThe Jackson family is also said to be planning a small funeral ceremony at a cemetery in the Hollywood Hills, calling it a \u201cprivate family function\u201d.. His dead body was never been brought to light between public (Only once wrapped in a white sheet\u2192 KAFFON). Why the funeral service was a private one? When this matter holds a great question and no evidence that his funeral had took place according to JW rites, some bluffers claiming that he is still alive!!!.. Ridiculous!\u2666 Cause, THERE ARE NO EVIDENCE HIS FUNERAL WAS HELD ACCORDING TO JW RITES? Furthermore, The broadcasted memorial service doesn't feature any religious custom.. In a nutshell, the funeral was secret and there're no evidence of- according to JWs' religious custom, Michael's funeral took place; because, Michael was buried as a Muslim. Now, it's about the two Islamic songs \"Give thanks to Allah\" & \u201cWaiting for the Call\u201d(aka. \"Islam in my veins\") by MJ. At first, listen to the voice of MJ's lattermost \u201cThis is it\u201d precisely. The voices are same. The original drum version of \"Islam in my veins\u201d was composed in 2009 by \u201cMichael Jackson\u201d and drum rhythm by \u201cOmar-Yanji\u201d. The rehearsal video of this song for \u201cThis Is It\u201d was missing since ~19th June, 2009. Soon after the death of Michael, when the audio released secretly, for misleading public on MJ's conversion and for falsifying that it wasn't sung by Michael, insisted by the forces of 'Illuminati', Pak-Canadian singer Irfan Makki performed the song on stage with dark background, made viral on the Internet claiming he performed the song in \u201cMuslim-fest Concert 2005\u201d. Total false fabrication. Actually, no song on Hajj titled \u201cWaiting for the call or, I.I.M.V.\u201d was performed in Muslim-fest 2005. Perhaps, he sang 2 songs there- \u201cMy brothers\u201d & \u201cWho are you\u201d. This (Original) one didn't match with any earlier song recorded by Irfan Makki before 2009. \u2605\u2605No doubt, the latter instrumental version (includes music) is by Irfan Makki recorded in 2011 by Awakening Records. Both comprises same lyrics approximately. But, the sole composer of this song is \u2013\u201cMichael Jackson\u201d. It was just false diabolic attempt to disproof MJ's conversion & to misguide public.. But, the accents and voice of MJ's \"Give thanks to Allah\" is too far and never resembles with the utterance style and accents of South-African artist Zain Bhikha. 'The utterance of Arabic accents precisely matches with Michael's latter voice'... It's also verified in \"Songs Tube\", \"Give thanks to Allah\" is enlisted there on \"Michael Jackson's all songs (A-Z)\". URL: Songs-tube.net, Best Music On Youtube \u2605\u2605\u2605N.B. Every singer performs their song after releasing it by enlisting into a specified album. Whereas, the feigned Zain Bhikha sang this song in an unknown fake concert on \"September 14, 2009\" to misrepresent that it was his song. Then he released in his album \"A way of life\" in 2010. But, \"Give thanks to Allah\" was actually released in 2009 very prior to June.. Then Zain falsified, \u201cI recorded the song many years ago as a simple Children's song\u201d. \u2666From doing research on Zain Bhikha's all nasheeds released before 2011.. None of them, since the beginning of his musical career don't match with the intonation of \u201cGive thanks to Allah\u201d. Though Zain can fluctuate his voice within 2 variable trilling voices, his(Z) utterance style, voice & accents are quite different. Moreover, \u201cGive Thank To Allah\u201d is Non-Instrumental song where a Rhythm Musician featured from beginning to end and used his tune as instrumental effect. He\u2019s singing in a trilling voice. What\u2019s his identity? By NK technology, the voice and utterance of that mysterious vocalist clearly indicates of a voluble \u2018American\u2019. Both the Islamic songs were composed by solely Michael Jackson. The 2 impersonators (Zain, Irfan) were allotted by 'Illuminati' for misleading purpose. But, true MJ fans abled to clearly recognize the voice of 'Michael' at \u201cIslam in my veins\". After being converted to Islam, Michael used to wear Islamic prayer beads (Tasibh), which contains 99 beads. Only Muslims bear this Holy stuff with them. In the Autopsy report narrative, it\u2019s said those same wooden beads were found on the left foot of Michael\u2019s death bed. The Autopsy report also shows several marks on his lower back which\u2019 re believed to be the impressions from the wooden beats\u2019 perimortem. It Irrefutably proves that Michael died as a Muslim man. Many proofs had been wiped out. \u2666Furthermore, the red string bracelet had no link with Kabbalah. MJ brought it from his African trip prior to 1998 & wore that until his death. But, the rumour of this string pertaining to MJ started since 2005. [False Rumour\u2192 Elizabeth Taylor, member of the Kabbalah Centre encouraged her old-friend Michael Jackson to wear that red string as protection from the evil-eye during his 2005 trial for molestation, where he was eventually cleared of all charges.] The design of that red string bracelet was somewhat variant. Meanwhile, he used to wear several designed string bracelets also. \u25feSome people demand- why MJ didn't use his Muslim name \"Mikael\" instead of Michael?\u27a1 In English-\"Michael\" & Arabic-\"Mikael\". Both means- \u2018Angel of God\u2019. As same as- \u201cGod\u201d instead of the Arabic root \u201cAllah\u201d. It's not obligatory in Islam. Furthermore, a Muslim is known by his good deeds, his \u2018Iman\u2019 & belief in \"Oneness Of The Almighty God\" (not by name). \u2754Now my question to the disbelievers \" Jermaine who\u2019s a devout Muslim, why don't use his Muslim name'Abdul Aziz' frequently ?.. \u2666To make his conversion truth more complicated and to falsely debunk, the shrewd liar gospel \u2018duo Mary Mary\u2019 falsely blogged on their Facebook page that Jackson \"prayed with Sandra and Andre Crouch and accepted Christ into his heart. Now he's singing in the heavenly choir! Plus, falsifying that Michael prayed with Andrea & Sandra Crouch for anointing the Holy spirit & accepted Christ as his saviour by Salvation\u274e and made this fake fabrication a rumour. 100% fake!! Notwithstanding, Sandra Crouch own by herself revealed in her official timeline: \"It has been brought to our attention that several media outlets that we met our dear friend Michael several weeks prior to his death so he could accept Christ. This is incorrect and absolutely not true. Any kind of congregation for evangelisation prayers never occurred between us......\" [Succinct] \u2666Many empirics claimed, Michael didn't want to publicize his conversion report, as his brother Jermaine didn't want in 1989, (but a reporter from UK revealed it before Jermaine\u2019s self declaration to public), as it was their personal religious faith and didn't want to propagandize to public.. British Newspaper \"The Sun\" reported the conversion first among the News-Media on 22nd November, 2008 (SATURDAY). Amid the lyrics of greatest \"Black Or White\", Michael asserted before \"They print my message in the Saturday Sun\". \u21aaThat Report Could Not Be Any Speculation Or Just a Coincidence. Admittedly, That Was The Revelation Of Michael Jackson. \u2605\u2605Right away, Michael was going to reveal his reversion to Islam on his come-back \u201cThis Is It\u201d as he proclaimed before as his \u2018secret-surprise' at \u2018Final Curtain Call\u2019. And he was about to disclose the dark forces of Illuminati who maligned and alleged him in several deceitful indictments for years. There, he was going to challenge those Satanists. Before it had happened, MJ deceased on June 25, 2009 and left this cruel world for good. Michael Jackson's announcement of \u201cThis Is It\u201d at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, London at 5:35pm (GMT) ; March 5, 2009; in front of the world\u2019s media Illuminati's Satanists tried to hide the report of Michael\u2019s conversion to Islam with manipulations. Some things in life they just don\u2019t wanna see You know I do really hate to say it The government don\u2019t wanna see... But if Michael Jackson was livin\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t let this be! The general public is unaware that it was The Illuminati who had Michael Jackson murdered. World\u2019s Most Powerful Secret Society \u2018Illuminati\u2019 controls the media, entertainment and music industries' lock, stock and barrel and if an artist wants fame and fortune they must sell their souls to the powers that be who control these particular industries. Their goal is to hook the masses of people into a maze of satanic decadence. Although Conrad Murray, the doctor who was the dern person to see him alive for the last time was ultimately convicted in the death of Michael Jackson I strongly believe without a shadow of a doubt that the murder was involved a wider conspiracy. The powers that be saw him as a threat because he wasn\u2019t the naive Peter Pan character that they believed him to be. The conspiracy became more perilous, when Michael Jackson reverted to \u2018Islam\u2019. And when they knew the secret of \u201cMichael\u2019s surprise key-song \u2018Islam in my veins\u2019 for \u2018This Is It\u2019- the Final curtain-call\u201d. This was surely a great problem because he had influence over billions of people throughout the world. The Illuminati feared that the No.1 entertainer of the world would use this influence that would be counter-productive to their agenda. Michael Jackson was their evolved enemy as he tried to help the world and open our eyes of humanity and raise the contentiousness of the planet. He tried to show us the hidden master of lies and deception and enlightening people to the real sense of \u201cThe Almighty God\u201d.. Just listen to his songs\u2192 \u201cHeal The World\u201d, \u201cEarth Song\u201d, \u201cThey Don't Care About Us\u201d,.. esp. \u201cGive Thanks To Allah\u201d... His last messages were- 1. \u201cWe've 4 years to reverse the damage done. This is our last chance to fix these problem that we have\u201d. 2. \u201cTake hold of your 'Iman', believe in the 'Oneness' of God, acknowledge the true God 'Allah' & pray only to him\u201d. Moreover, he also owned 50% of the world\u2019s most valuable music publishing catalogue and he wasn\u2019t willing to part with it. So, in their eyes Michael had to be eliminated. Jackson family wasn't allowed to openly concede Michael's conversion. But the truth exposed in some way... May God (Allah) bestow 'Michael Jackson' the blessed Heaven. R.I.P. MJ. [NOTE\u27b2 Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that these documentary evidences in no way denounce any upright individual. My entire thesis is based on numerous firm true evidences those consolidates the truth of Michael Jackson's conversion report. It\u2019s about verity.] ",

The Media had reported the news of Michael Jackson\u2019s conversion to Islam in 2008 November with a clear reference to the change of his name to \u2018Mikaeel\u2019 Michael Jackson 'becomes a Muslim and changes name to Mikaeel' Didn\u2019t anybody notice that on 5th March, 2009 the singer made a public appearance, announcing his concert himself through a press conference in front of thousands of his fans? This Is It (concert residency) - Wikipedia  What is the name written in there? Mikaeel or Michael? The question of Music being Haraam in Islam If you hear any of those loud preachers of Islam, they clearly say that Music is haraam (banned) in Islam citing Quran, then the question arises was michael following Islam by that logic? Sufis are bombed by radical extremist groups who believe in singing the praise of almighty God, they are always denounced as anti-islam and frowned upon by orthodox Islamic clergy on this point for deviating from this basic rule of Islam, then doesn\u2019t this sound contradictory that on one hand Michael Jackson accepted Islam on Nov, 2008, and in March, 2009 announced his Musical shows and stage performances for next two years by himself appearing in front of Media and his fans. LOL Why didn\u2019t he come up with his new name? There are plenty of examples that you can get online where preachers are continuously talking about Music being banned in Islam and discouraging it\u2019s practice the video below is just one of those examples  Mufti Menk even takes the name of Michael Jackson on 0:50 , emphasizing how listening to any kind of Music is banned in Islam. They say even \u2018Listening\u2019 to music is banned, Michael not only listened to the music, but even composed it and use to dance on it. Is this Islamic by that logic, a person who earns his bread through Music can he be Muslim by any chance? Take one stand then. Michael Jackson, the king of pop, can be never be disassociated from Music by any chance? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess!!! Music and Michael permeated each other, Music was in his pores it was his soul hence even the claim that he died a Muslim would be unbeliveable. Still if some want to believe it and spread that news then question remains if Music is Islamic or Un-Islamic? ",

            "answer_text": "Michael had no immediate reason to abandon Christianity, the religion he was born into & piously followed. He had even disguised himself to go door to door preaching the Gospel and distributing pamphlets back in the days before he was excommunicated by his chruch elders for God knows why. Anyway that's not the point. The thing is he was a faithful Christian. If you look up \u201crev. June Gatlin\u201d on youtube, and watch her Vanity Fair interviews where she talks about Michael Jackson, you'll know what I'm talking about. By the way, she was the real spiritual guru of Michael Jackson, the one whom he turned to when he needed direction and positive company.  Now I'm not saying Michael was Islamophobic. He could never be one because it was not how he was. Michael was never hateful. He loved people of all races, religion, culture, nationality. In fact, he was extremely fascinated by Islam. He loved Muslims. He loved their culture. He loved how modest, simple and disciplined they are compared to people in the West! He revealed in an interview that he wanted to permanently settle in Bahrain! If you too are a Moonwalker, I'm sure you'd know how inquisitive a person Michael Jackson was! He had the curiousity of a child! I\u2019m very sure you'd know Michael was a voracious reader. He loved books especially, on spiritualism and philosophy. I don't recollect where, but I saw an interview where someone in his family had spoken about how Michael had even read the Koran! He was obviously very curious and enchanted by a culture different than his own and which was what had attracted him to the middle east I presume. And he loved Bahrain (as told by him in an interview) and even wanted to permanently settle there, he loved the country for how inviting and warm the people are as opposed to people in his own home State who are so keen to suck the life out of him. But then again, his growing proximity to the middle East might have caused that reaction from people who were both surprised and jealous of the enormous love he was getting from them. This might have sparked the rumor about him converting to Islam. And why won't there be any rumor, Michael Jackson is so famous after all !! The more famous and successful a person gets, greater the attention -good or bad- on him. That's how the world sadly is. Whatever it might have been the case \u2026the truth is that none of us can really tell exactly what went down. We can only speculate because he didn't publicly proclaim anything, neither were there any clear signs nor any credible evidence (like records, etc) found to prove his Islamization. Hence, on the basis of my analysis I conclude that Michael Jackson died a believer in Christ. Michael Jackson died a Christian and had a Christian funeral ! And as far as the rumors of the Islamic songs (eg: Give thanks to Allah) that were said to have been composed and sung by Michael, are again, in my opinion completely baseless. The songs were actually sung by an artist named Zain Bhikha who had a similar voice. PS:- after much research online I have found an interesting article that seems to be a credible source among a sea of flashy, juicy, sensational news articles.

            "answer_text": "Only other muslims claim it. Michael never changed his name to \u2018Mikael\u2019 or whatever. His name was \u2018Michael\u2019 till his last breath. You can see it in his This Is It album poster. and also his name on his autopsy report is \u2018Michael Joe Jackson\u2019.  Earlier, he was \u2018Jehovah's Witness\u2019 until 1987, thats why he was well-mannered and discouraged Violence. He visited Muslim dominant places like Brunei but that doesn\u2019t make him a muslim. He also visited India, where he already knew about \u2018Lord Ganesha\u2019 and \u2018Nataraj\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t make him a hindu. His funeral was also in accordance to christian belief. Many people also complaint about his closed casket but that was because he wore a wig in his last days and applied a lot of make-up. I don\u2019t think his loved ones could have seen him in that stage. The song \u2018Give thanks to Allah\u2019 is written and sung by Zain Bikha not MJ, so stop spreading rumours that MJ sung that song. And also one of his last song \u2018This is It\u2019 has some phrases from Bible. This is it, here I standI'm the light of the world The second line of the song is taken from Bible. ( Again Jesus spoke to them, saying,\u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\u201d) Why would he record a song which has phrases from bible? of course because he was a christian. His friends also claim that he kept on talking about Bible in his last days. I have read about Islam, and Music is considered haram in Islam, it is believed that Music raises our sexual hype and distracts us from the path of Allah, in short Pop Music. Most Michael Jackson\u2019s song fall into that criteria (The way you make me feel, in the closet, Don\u2019t stop til you get enough and many more, these definitely raise our sexual hype). Music is considered Dirty in Islam. Why would The King Of Pop separate himself from Music especially Pop music which Islam objects ? Michael Jackson thought beyond Religions, Castes, Races, Genders since his childhood, he didn\u2019t need to change his religion he was following for 3 decades. I will repeat \u2018HE WAS NOT A MUSLIM\u2019 . This rumour itself is not covered by Big News Channels, if he had really changed his religion, the story would have been given to CNN, The Guardian or other such big channels, not some Islam Fanbase.

Some credible resources claimed that MJ had converted to Islam before he passed. Michael Jackson 'becomes a Muslim and changes name to Mikaeel' 'Mikaeel' Jackson converts to Islam? And another resource, including his lawyer claimed that he was a Christian and he got Christian funeral. http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/michael-jackson-prince-bahrain-settled-lawsuit-amicably-lawyers-article-1.334844?force_desktop=true?force_desktop=true According to these, there are 2 conclusions MJ was a Muslim but he kept it secretly. I came across some converted Muslims who hide their religion due to so many reasons. They are not ready to tell the world that they became Muslims.MJ was not a Muslim but he was learning Islam. MJ elder brother said that he gave Islamic books to MJ and MJ had been asking a lot of questions about Islam to him. It implied that MJ was learning Islam before he died and maybe already converted to Islam too.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I don\u2019t know what do you mean by \u201cAccepting Islam\u201d If you mean \u201cDid he accepted it as a religion\u201d, yes he did. He accepted all religions, genders, races, sexcual orientations etc. If you mean \u201cDid he accepted it as his own personal religion\u201d no, he didn\u2019t. He did however visit strict Muslim countries such as Brunei (Where also performed two concerts) and Bahrain, but he was anything BUT a muslim. He was a Christian for his whole life, at first a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, and we don\u2019t know his faith he used to practice from 1988 to 2009. Anyways, he was obviously Christian. First of all, the song \u201cIslam in my veins\u201d was not by him. Look at the unreleased songs by Michael Jackson article in Wikipedia. List of unreleased songs recorded by Michael Jackson - Wikipedia Where on Earth are \u201cIslam in my veins\u201d and \u201cGive thanks to Allah\u201d? Just go to the article, press Ctrl+F and type their names. These songs aren\u2019t his. He also never change his name to Mikaeel, as many people believe, and you can prove it by the sign in the This Is It announcement and movie boxart, as well as the Michael album.     His autopsy report also says his real name  If he was really a Muslim, his mother would not approve it since she is a Jehovah Witness. \ufeff Most people think he was Muslim because of his bracelets resembing praying beads.  But they aren\u2019t. I also wear such bracelets. No-one calss me a Muslim, though. Also, there are millions if not billions of Muslims that don\u2019t wear those bracelets. Does that means they aren\u2019t Muslims? That\u2019s ingorrant. In fact, monks in Greece (Which is a strict Christian nation), especially in Mount Athos, wear those bracelets (Who they call \"\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\", \"Knot-ropes\") and they say \"Jesus Christ save me\" (\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u0399\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad \u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5.) as many times as their knots. Does that mean that the most Christian Greeks are actually Muslims?\ufeff Even if he was indeed a Muslim, why do we even care of it? Let him rest. Edit: As Jasbeer said, music is also banned in Islam. If you hear any of those loud preachers of Islam, they clearly say that Music is haraam (banned) in Islam citing Quran, then the question arises was michael following Islam by that logic? Sufis are bombed by radical extremist groups who believe in singing the praise of almighty God, they are always denounced as anti-islam and frowned upon by orthodox Islamic clergy on this point for deviating from this basic rule of Islam, then doesn\u2019t this sound contradictory that on one hand Michael Jackson accepted Islam on Nov, 2008, and in March, 2009 announced his Musical shows and stage performances for next two years by himself appearing in front of Media and his fans.

            "answer_text": "Well the question's answer is not 100% clear. There are many sources that claim Michael Jackson had converted to Islam a few months before his death. It is also said that he was the composer of \u201cGive Thanks to Allah\u201d. On the other hand, those who claim that MJ was a Christian till the end is because he had funeral similar to that of Christians. Also, he came to the stage once to say final goodbye to the world and his name as written on the board was Michael rather than Mikael. The problem could be of islamophobia, i.e., hatred towards Islam. His fans were die hard fans and so the fact of conversion might have been concealed. It is also known that Jackson had been overdosed by his doctor who was a very well abled doctor. Anyway, to give a final verdict would be too soon as we don't have much evidence. But it should be noted that many singers, actors etc. have also converted into Islam and so it is pointless to say that since MJ was a singer, it is not possible for him to have converted. Even his own sister, who was a sexual lyrics singer converted into Islam and has abandoned the stage. ",

This story has been refuted many times and MJ himself never remarked on it. I am very confident though that he did NOT convert to Islam (mainstream Islam that we we today). I say that because there is another Muslim belief system that originated in America that is also denounced by all Muslims as being heretical. Think of it along the lines of how many Christians view Mormonism. This Muslim faith is called Nation of Islam the same once Muhammad Ali converted to. It primarily seeks to attract blacks. I will let you all do your own research on Nation of Islam. It does have little in common with mainstream Islam and, again, is looked upon as heretical. Still, if MJ had converted, the NOI is likely what he would have converted to. ",

So, if it were true, it would have most likely been just as transient. Jermain, his older brother, has been muslim for decades. His sister, Janet, of course converted to marry Billionaire, Wissam. But she has since quietly left islam shortly after leaving her former husband. So, who knows/who cares? Just a sad family overall. ",
