            "answer_text": "Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones wrote several top 40 hit's playing in open G. Duane Allman, Derek Trucks and many other slide guitar players use(d) an open E tuning. Gregg Allman really liked open G for his acoustic tunes. Neil Young and David Crosby used a lot of interesting tunings, open D being the most common. Jimmy Page used many different tunings. The Texas bluesman Albert Collins used something like C#m with a capo. These are just few off the top of my head. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most innovative open tuning user is Joni Mitchell. The music of Joni Mitchell is distinctive, creative and sublime. Joni does not use the conventional DADGAD, or open chord type tuning, she arrived at her own recipes, and some of these are amazing. If you are interested in open guitar voicing, I can recommend studying Joni Mitchell\u2019s guitar technique. ",
