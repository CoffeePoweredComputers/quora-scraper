Some of her shows are definitely 18+ (some of the festivals are tailored to drinking age audiences). Her own shows (where she is the headliner) don\u2019t usually have a set age limit. If you\u2019re a parent wondering whether she is age appropriate for a kid, then it really depends on if you\u2019re okay with a little swearing. If your kid is older than 10, then they\u2019ve probably heard worse things sitting on the school bus. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think an age is set for her shows, especially her tour, but it depends on the discretion of the parents. Most of Billie\u2019s songs are pretty clean when it comes to language, but when it comes to other things, there are definitely some songs that I consider more appropriate than others. She also has a slightly mature interlude in her concerts of the tour that was postponed due to covid-19. Personally, I think anywhere from 11-13 would be a good minimum age for a Billie concert, but it really depends! :) ",
