            "answer_text": "What made you to come up with this false allegation. You seem ignorant. Anyway just cause Ariana Grande admires and respect Black ppl doesn\u2019t mean she wants to be Black. She\u2019s influenced by Black people doesn\u2019t mean is trying to act Black. If you knew about the history of music and Black History in general you will realize the music genre she sings was created by Black ppl. Unlike other white people Ariana Grande knows her history. and I\u2019m Black myself. ",

She\u2019s italian and most of the photos you\u2019ve probably seen (like the ones where she\u2019s wearing the white pants and burgundy lipstick) where she looks very dark. These are cleary edited. Plus when she was in Victorious she wore 3x lighter shaded foundation to look lighter (here\u2019s proof from a 2011 tweet)  and here\u2019s a picture compared to her mother and nonna  and some more :)    ",
