            "answer_text": "Short answer no, they didn't and hopefully won't (intentional or not). But they did get accused, I remember one that made some news at the time where a twitter user accused RM of having plagiarized his quote in one of BTS' songs (I don't remember which one but with a quick search you can easily find it), in the end they DMed each other and everything went well. BTS made also a lot of cover songs with the same base but different lyrics (ex. Born Singer, Graduation, Adult Child etc.), some people mistake those songs as official commercial tracks when they are totally free and exclusively published on youtube or soundcloud without the intention of making money off them. Not to mention the mixtapes, they have pretty much the same rules as those songs mentioned above. On a sidenote, I hope the hixtape will be out soon. ",

P.S im a huge fan of bts and admire their hard work :D ",
