            "answer_text": "Eric Clapton progressed through several guitars and guitar brands over his long career. If you look at websites listing his gear you can see nearly 275 different guitars from brands like Fender, Gretsch and Gibson. Most of those sounds he had in Cream were from a Gibson SG. His solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was on a Les Paul. He said he liked the guitar very much but found it heavy to play. There was also an image thing with Stratocasters. Many British guitarists from that era wanted them. Buddy Holly, who was seen as one of the early American rock electric guitarist, likely have a lot to do with it. And then the fact that they were so hard to get New England doubled the cost up session these guys had to get them.That\u2019s not specific to Eric Clapton but his generation of guitarist. ",

            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t answer exactly why, but one factor could be the sound (they sound different, 3 single coils vs 2 humbuckers), the Strat provides more sound options, BUT the Les Paul has a richer sound. None is better than the other. It\u2019s just about the sound you are looking for your musical style. The Strat is much lighter than the Les Paul. When you are standing up for long hours, weight is an issue as well. Can\u2019t speak for Eric Clapton, but those are the things I\u2019d consider for using one or the other. ",
