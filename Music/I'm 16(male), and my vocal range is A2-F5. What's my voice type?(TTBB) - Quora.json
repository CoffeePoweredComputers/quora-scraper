I\u2019m inclined to say you\u2019re a baritone, because your range vears towards the lllower-to-mid area of the spectrum. I advise anyone with a serious interest in singing to take voice lessons. That way,, they don\u2019t risk damaging their voice, & they get unbiased feedback on questions like this. Also keep in mind that your voice part can change as you age, & cartilage becomes bone. You may want to revisit this question when you get closer to 30 right now, let a voice &/or choral teacher guide that determination. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I'd be careful of straining for the high notes, although it's possible that with training you could become more comfortable with them. With such a wide range and the fact the highest notes aren't entirely easy I'd say you might be a baritone or bass-baritone, but without hearing your voice itself, the color and tessitura (comfort zone most of the time,) I couldn't be sure. You may want to have a teacher or more experienced singer listen to you and ask their opinion. ",
