            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written before about my problem with \u201c(Don\u2019t Fear) The Reaper\u201d. I was completely unable to listen to it for years; I got horrible panic attacks even hearing the opening. Here\u2019s what happened: as a kid, I went through what we\u2019ll call a lengthy cancer thing that involved a lot of spinal surgeries. As a result, I spent a lot of time in back braces and body casts, in varying degrees of paraplegia, staring at the ceiling, often unable to control my environment. If someone left the TV on, I had to watch that channel until someone changed it or turned it off. Same with lights, noise, anything. Just me staring at my old buddy The Ceiling, lost in thought. The winter of my 12th year was a hard one healthwise, because my spine is damaged by radiation and the repairs they were trying to do weren\u2019t taking. I had a lengthy run in the hellish torture device that was a primitive version of the halo brace. Here\u2019s one version:  Image courtesy of the quora upload gallery \u2026what this doesn\u2019t show you is that the \u201chalo\u201d doesn\u2019t just float around your head to ensure you don\u2019t turn it too far. The circlet is held in place by pieces they call \u201cpins\u201d, which are really sharp-tipped bolts that are literally screwed into your skull. This is a miserable device. The lambswool lining was worse than the inside of a cast. You couldn\u2019t have a proper wash, and the thing stunk. Every time you bumped into something (and one horrible time that I slipped and fell on ice), you had to go to the orthopedic device place to get the pins \u201ctightened\u201d. Again, a prettied-up way to describe it\u2026the guy who did mine cried with me as he used a wrench to screw the bolts deeper into my skull. Anyway. There was no going to school in this damn thing. If I ventured out, people stared and pulled their children away from me. I became very sensitive to this and begged my mother not to make me leave the house, but she couldn\u2019t leave me alone either, so I ended up having to sit on hard YMCA risers and watch my little brother\u2019s basketball games as people stared. I\u2019d come to hate basketball anyway, because a neighbor \u201cborrowed\u201d me for a basketball game she was attending so that she could point out my horrible appliance to the parking lot attendant and get a sweet disabled parking spot. It was a dark, dark time in my life. Besides the physical pain, of which there was lots, I felt helpless and used and pessimistic, with more than a bit of suicidal ideation thrown in\u2026usually when people had made extra-large asses of themselves that day regarding my appearance. Enter Blue \u00d6yster Cult. I was stuck, on my back, in my bed. The homebound teacher came for an hour or so a day to make sure I was keeping up with my class, and most of that time she spent gabbing with my mom about her upcoming wedding. The rest of the time, my arms got tired and dropped books on my face. In those pre-household-Internet years, there was nothing else to do but watch TV (I couldn\u2019t angle myself correctly to see) or listen to the radio. There was a small radio in the corner of my room and it was left on the classic rock station 24 hours a day. No one ever seemed to turn it off, and I could never have reached it. It had to be on the other side of the room because all of the metal around me messed with the reception. If you\u2019ve ever listened to classic rock radio, you know how often the same songs come up over and over and over again. \u201c(Don\u2019t Fear) the Reaper\u201d was on heavy rotation, as it is from time to time. With nothing to do but lie there suffocating in my own depression, it was a bad song to be drilled into my head. The first few times, I just took it in without really listening to the lyrics. Then I listened to them and believed, in my mindset, that B\u00d6C was encouraging suicide. I became fixated on those lyrics, probably because I also have obsessive-compulsive issues. Self-preservation kicked in and I began regarding the song with dread. The opening notes (you know the ones) would be enough to make me start to hyperventilate. I would close my eyes, but I couldn\u2019t shut out the song. It got through fingers jammed into my ears. I could not get away from it. This happened anywhere from four to six times in a 24-hour period, and sometimes it was the dreaded extra-long version where they noodled around on a bridge for an extra minute or so before going back to that horrible hook. I got cold sweats on \u201ctwo-fer Tuesdays\u201d, waiting through \u201cBurnin\u2019 For You\u201d, knowing what would surely come next. According to classic rock stations, B\u00d6C only recorded two songs. I once threw my pins out of alignment trying to toss the heaviest thing I could reach, which was Eugenie Clark\u2019s Lady with a Spear, at the radio and missing. Eventually, the brace came off and the pins were pulled out. Blood wept from wounds that looked like bullet holes and eventually faded to concave spots on my forehead and hairless patches behind my ears. My phobia and dread of the song remained for another two decades. When I heard the opening notes, desperation washed over me like waves hitting from all directions. The worst part was when it surprised me: in movies, like the miniseries The Stand or the film Otis, in Halloween, or when I had forgotten that I\u2019d left a radio on in the other room. As recently as eight years ago, I had a panic-induced asthma attack when it surprised me on a soundtrack, and I hated myself for it. I thought, what kind of nonsense is this? It\u2019s a song, fool. You\u2019re letting a song get the better of you? You\u2019re letting a song reduce you to a sniveling pile that\u2019s seriously considering throwing away all the hard work your doctors put into keeping you alive? Nope, this isn\u2019t going to work. So I went about my own desensitization therapy so that Blue \u00d6yster Cult and I could coexist without this musical Achilles\u2019 Heel felling me left and right out of nowhere. The Saturday Night Live sketch went a long way toward helping. It\u2019s silly, for one, and brings that dread down to a level I can deal with. It\u2019s also useful in that the song stops and starts many times, allowing me to hear those opening notes without getting on the rollercoaster of emotion that came after. Opening notes\u2026funny. Opening notes\u2026funny. No one in that room is telling a twelve year old cancer patient to kill herself. And that\u2019s what I needed. People have repeated the \u201ccowbell\u201d thing to death, but it worked for me.  I wish I could say that I\u2019m all better now, but I\u2019m not. Every once in a while, it surprises me on the radio and I feel the beginnings of a panic attack. I can talk myself out of it a lot of the time, but not always. Sometimes it\u2019s Tuesday and I hear \u201cBurnin\u2019 for You\u201d end and I think, I can\u2019t take this. I turn off the radio. And when I watched the finale for the past season of Orange is the New Black and it came out of nowhere, I clenched my jaw so hard I had muscle spasms for a week. I\u2019ve not yet gotten to the place where I can say, \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s put on \u201c(Don\u2019t Fear) the Reaper\u201d. That\u2019s a great song.\u201d I can\u2019t make myself cause the song to happen, if that makes any sense. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll ever be the case. ",

            "answer_text": "So there is one song that has brought me to tears ever since I was a little girl. Even to this day, at 32 years of age, I cannot listen to this song all the way through. I always end up turning it off because I start weeping histerically. A little background : I am the youngest of four girls. I have two biological sisters and one sister that is actually my cousin who my parents took in before I was born. I guess in order for this to make sense, I will need to explain, as briefly as I can, about some major and not so pleasant things that took place in my family. My parents were married in 1973 and had my oldest biological sister one year, one month, and 9 days later (to be precise. Lol) My sister was an only child for the first six years of her life. Then everything in the family changed quite dramatically. My mother had my second sister, who is four years older than I am. All around the same time, my Aunt, who has been the most dysfunctional person I have ever heard of who has some how managed to stay alive despite her lifestyle, told my parents and my grandparents that she was no longer keeping her children and she would put them into foster care if they did not take them in. She then disappeared for a time, abandoning her four young children alone on a campground to fend for themselves. That is where my dad eventually found them after searching frantically. That is how my next sister, biologically my cousin, entered our family. When my dad picked her and her two brothers and one sister up after being dumped there by their sorry excuse for a mother, the things my poor cousins had endured and witnessed in their short little lives were more horrific than most people\u2019s absolute worst night mares. They had been abused, molested, and completely neglected. My Aunt is a drug addict and she had her fist child at age 14. She is currently on her 9th husband\u2026. That is right\u2026 I said 9th husband. In order to feed her drug habit, she, at one time, actually prostituted her oldest daughter when she was still a small child. As a mother, I cannot begin to fathom how she could have done that to her baby. That detail was to give you an idea of the kind of life that these poor kids had. When my dad picked my cousins up, the one who became my sister had a badly deformed arm because she had broken it and, although it was in a cast at one point, my druggie aunt got one of her druggie boyfriends to cut the cast off before my sister\u2019s arm had properly set and her arm healed completely crooked. Needless to say, my sister needed a lot of attention, love, and care when she came into my family. My parents were fairly young mind you. My father was 19 years old when he and my mom married, so at this point he is still only 25 years old. My mother was a stay at home mom, so my father went from having a family of three to provide for to instantly having a family of five to take care of. And my cousin/sister required a lot of trips to doctors and hospitals to try and undo as much of the neglect and damage done while living with her mother. That was a lot of responsibility weighing on my parent\u2019s shoulders and a lot of financial responsibility suddenly on my father in particular. Amidst all of this, my mother began battling her own internal battle. Part of it may have been post partum and likely part of it was major life changes that took place within my family\u2026. whatever the case may be, the stress manifested itself in my mother as severe depression. So severe that she attempted suicide. So, add that heavy load to the burden of responsibility lying on my dad\u2019s shoulders and add in the medical bills that come along with trying to treat a depressed and suicidal person. The end result was that my father had to take on more and more work to try and stay afloat. By the time I was a young child he worked for a major oil and gas company. His job began to require him to travel. At first, just minimal traveling. But as the years progressed, it went from minimal times he would be out of town to minimal times he was actually home. His job sent him to Dubai, Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela\u2026. That is just to name a few and often he would be gone for a month at a time, come back home for a week to two weeks, and then leave for another month. My dad didn't want to be away from his family like he was, but he was given ultimatums by his corporate oil and gas company. Take this promotion that will require even more travel or there will not be a position for you. My father ended up being the senior marketing manager for this very major and well known corporation making six figures a year and he did not have a day of college education. He worked his way from the very bottom, and I mean very bottom of the company, (he dug ditches at the oil refinery as his first position in the company after they finally agreed to give him a job because he showed up every single day asking for any work they could give him) My point here is this. If he lost his job in this company, he would quite literally be starting from scratch with no college degree or anything that had become a prerequisite by that time for even the lowest positions of employment in all of these corporate companies. His family had grown even more by this point, because I came along, and he was still paying off the medical bills he acquired from my cousin/sister 15 years after she joined our family as well as the bills that piled up after my mom\u2019s battle with depression. Because of my mom\u2019s emotional struggles, she was unable to work at all or take any of the financial burden off of my father. He reasoned on the matter that our family would be worse off if he lost his job because of refusal to travel and that being gone so much was the lesser of two evils. A side note: He later has stated on many occasions that this decision is his biggest regret. If he had it to do all over again he would have refused the promotion, lost that job, and had the family make adjustments to simplify our lives. His being gone sorely effected our family and, at one point, it truly and completely fell apart. The lesser of the two evils would have been to lose his job. But you know what they say\u2026 hind sight\u2019s 20/20. So getting to the song\u2026 Finally! The song I cannot hear to this day is, The cat\u2019s in the cradle by Harry Chapin. For those of you unfamiliar with this song I will give a portion of the lyrics so you can see why this song is so difficult for me. \u201cMy child arrived just the other day He came to the world in the usual way But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay He learned to walk while I was away And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew He'd say, \"I'm gonna be like you, dad You know I'm gonna be like you.\" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon \"When you coming home, dad?\" \"I don't know when But we'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then.\" My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, dad; come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" He said, \"That's okay.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed And said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah You know I'm gonna be like him.\" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon \"When you coming home, dad?\" \"I don't know when But we'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then.\" And now, as I wipe away the tears that stream down my face, I will end my long and drawn out answer to this question. Thanks for reading and take care. -Dana- ",
