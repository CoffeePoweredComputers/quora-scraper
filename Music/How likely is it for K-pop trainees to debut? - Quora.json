            "answer_text": "Depends on the company! If we look at the big 3 they usually debut their groups every 3\u20134 years. For YG, Winner debuted in 2014, iKON debuted in 2015 and now they\u2019ll be debuting Treasure 13 this year so the debut gap is 4\u20135 years for a new bg. BLACKPINK was the first gg in 7 years since 2ne1 and there\u2019s no news about a new gg for YG. BLACKPINK has been in the industry for 3 years so there\u2019s a chance that they will debut a new gg next year. For JYP stray kids debuted in 2017 so a new bg will probably be seen in 2\u20133 years. Itzy just debuted this year and the gap between twice and itzy was 4 years. For SM Red velvet debuted in 2014 so there\u2019s a chance a new gg will be coming very soon. NCT debuted back in 2016 so we might see a new bg soon too. There are many other companies that have debuted their groups this year so depending on that company you might be waiting for a few years until they debut another group. If a company is desperate to release a new group so that their company will be known, they\u2019ll do that, but depending on the company and how long you train for and if you\u2019re good enough to debut you might be waiting for a couple of years ",
