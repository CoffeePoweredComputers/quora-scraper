            "answer_text": "Yeah I know the feeling! I\u2019ve always had music playing in my head since as long as I can remember. Literally always! Even when I\u2019m dreaming! The only moment I can remember not having music playing in my head is after meditating or focusing hard on listening to natural sounds around me. In fact that\u2019s the only way I know I am truly living in the current moment. To really hear what\u2019s going on around me without a song playing in my head is a very weird experience and actually quite liberating. I would recommend trying meditation for this - if you can focus your mind on \u201cnot-thinking\u201d enough and tune in to the world around you, so that your environment is what\u2019s playing in your head - it is truly an amazing feeling. I used to think there was something wrong with me too since I couldn\u2019t switch it off and it became very annoying, I used to picture the sound of TV static or imagine the song fading out to stop it but it has never worked. Over time I just accepted it and assumed that everyone else had the same thing. It used to keep me up because I\u2019d usually have something quite upbeat playing in my head and it would stimulate me or annoy me because \u201cffs I\u2019ve heard that song 1000 times already!\u201d Now I just listen to passive music every night while I sleep like this: Edit: updated video URL (same one but it's been re-uploaded for some reason):  Then I get this relaxed \u201chealing music\u201d playing in my head, before and while I sleep, which is very relieving and calming. I think the worst thing about having a song stuck in your head is how repetitive it can get, that\u2019s why this music works - because it\u2019s constantly changing and you can\u2019t anticipate what will happen next. So your brain eventually gives in and just lets the music sync with your internal audio. I usually start this music (on my phone with an App called Musi so it plays in the background) while I\u2019m reading before bed and by the time I\u2019m ready to sleep I forget that it\u2019s playing, I almost can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in my head or not by that point and the relaxing nature of the music takes advantage of my internal audio\u2019s strong effect. Sometimes, it can get really annoying having music constantly playing in your head without being able to control it, but I think the trick is to use it to your advantage. I tend to stay away from catchy songs or make sure the last song I\u2019ve heard isn\u2019t repetitive (jazz works wonders for this - for example, Bill Evans). As a rule I never play the same song twice in one day. I hope this helps! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with you! This happens to me too, not all the time though, only intermittently, though sometimes it will happen for weeks on end with few breaks. Usually when my brain sings it just spontaneously makes up new music, and it\u2019s actually really cool. Every song is different and I\u2019ve often thought that if I took the time to learn to write them down or record them in my computer I could actually end up making quite a lot of pretty decent original music. If you experience a lot of original brain music, maybe it\u2019s something worth looking into as a hobby. I think that maybe a singing head is a feature of latent musical talent, especially if you\u2019re just casually making up new songs in your head all the time. It must be something that a lot of songwriters experience, because I can\u2019t think of a better way to make new songs than to create them in your mind first. I don\u2019t think it happens to everyone, so you might actually be experiencing something pretty cool and unique. However, I will admit that sometimes it can be really frigging annoying when my brain decides to make up a repetitive harpsichord and didgeridoo symphony at 12 AM when I\u2019m trying to sleep, or when it decides that I\u2019m going to be \u201clistening\u201d to Kokomo by the Beach Boys against my will for the next week and a half. While these sorts of things can be hilarious, they can also be a nuisance, especially if you\u2019re trying to relax or concentrate. A few potentially effective ways to break cycles like this are A) get the song out, as in record it or write it down (this is best if it\u2019s something original), B) listen to the full song in real life if it\u2019s a song by someone else that you\u2019ve got stuck in your head, or C) get a different song/songs stuck in your head instead by listening to other catchy stuff that you find less irritating. As another poster on here already mentioned, meditating can also help a lot, and though it may take some practice to get it to work, it\u2019s definitely worth it for a lot more reasons than simply getting your musical noggin to shut the hell up every now and then. Basically, I don\u2019t think anything is wrong with you at all, unless the music is really annoying and/or repetitive and is significantly interfering with the quality of your life. In fact, the music in your head may actually be a sign of an undeveloped talent. Perhaps you would enjoy taking up singing or a musical instrument, and figure out a way to translate your involuntary brain music into actual recorded songs. :) I think getting it out would probably break any repetitive loops you might be suffering, and might even buy you some quiet until the next song arises, not to mention you\u2019ll end up with an artistic creation afterwards. My personal opinion on this is to just try to enjoy it if you can, and better yet, put it to use making music. Personally, I really enjoy the fact that my brain sings me weird new songs all the time, even when they\u2019re annoying, because even if they\u2019re dumb instead of beautiful, they can be pretty goddamned funny if you \u201clisten\u201d with the right attitude. Embrace your magical, musical brain, my friend! And good luck finding ways to cope with or get out the music :) There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, bud, you\u2019ve probably just got a neat hidden talent. ",
