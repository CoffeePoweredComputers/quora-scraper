            "answer_text": "In the $200-300 dollar range, HTIB surround sound systems usually leave you with more wires than improved sound. In that price range I'd recommend just adding a powered 2.0 or 2.1 speaker system and setting your TV's audio-out to variable level output. ( so the TV remote can control the volume ) I'd strongly recommend the Audioengine A2's ( $200, what I use for my desktop ), or the A5's ( $ 350 ) if you're really looking to treat yourself. http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Audioengine-2http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Audioengine-5 ",
