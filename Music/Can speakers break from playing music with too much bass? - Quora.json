            "answer_text": "Can speakers break from playing music with too much bass? Yes. A speaker has essentially two limits: mechanical and thermal. Thermal is what you see as power ratings, and is somewhat fluid as different recordings have different dynamic range (difference between the loud parts and the quiet parts) so the \u201caverage\u201d power can vary. Mechanical is how far the speaker can move forwards and backwards before it runs out of travel and bottoms out (called xMech, or mechanical excursion). The lower a note is, the more a speaker has to move to play at a given level of sound (SPL). For each octave down (halving of frequency), all else being the same, a speaker moves FOUR TIMES as much at a given volume. That is, if you are playing a 100Hz note at 95dB and the speaker is moving a 1/4\u2033 to do it, a 50Hz note at that same 95dB requires a full 1\u2033 of excursion! Take a speaker into and past xMech and you start to deform the voice coil bobbin- the tube that the voice coil is wound around. This can cause it to start to scrape in the gap of the magnet as it moves, and can cause the coil to short against the magnet. Push it well enough, often enough, into xMech and the spider (woven structure just on top of the magnet, that keeps the coil centered in the magnet\u2019s gap) takes damage, the surround (the rubber, or in some cases, foam, at the edge of the cone that joins it to the basket, and acts as a hinge as the speaker moves forwards and backwards) takes damage, in radical enough cases the cone itself gets deformed. Now, depending on how the speaker is enclosed, you can maximize output\u2026or minimize it. Near and at port frequencies in a vented enclosure, the speaker doesn\u2019t have to move much at all for lots of output as you benefit from the resonance of the air mass in the port. But, below the port frequency, the speaker unloads and bottoms out EASILY! So, you try to go with a rigid baffle and enclosure (if they move in response to the speaker, it is in the opposite direction and so \u201cabsorbs\u201d some of the speaker\u2019s output!), and pick the enclosure style and size around the speaker and its goal in that specific install, and then cross it over to minimize the frequencies it sees below its \u201chappy zone\u201d in that enclosure. A crossover is a set of filters that reduce what a speaker sees above or below a certain point. For instance, you low pass a sub to not see much above say 90Hz, and if it is ported you may also high pass it with a subsonic filter at just below the port frequency. The steeper the crossover\u2019s slope the more it filters out what you want gone; so that you can for instance put a 48dB/oct slope (very steep!) on the 6.5\u2033 mid in the door of a 2013 GM truck if you know the guy is going to wham the snot out of the 12\u2033 subs you just put under his back seat, (or the 6\u20138\u2033 bookshelf speaker at home paired with the new 15\u2033 powered sub you just got). This keeps the bass from launching that poor 6.5\u2033 into orbit when he fires up Kill Shot at 75% volume! Keep in mind, to extend the original question, \u201cbass\u201d can be interpreted to mean anything lower than what a given speaker wants to see. Feed 800Hz (well into the midrange) to most tweeters and try to get it to play it at 105dB\u2026it gon\u2019 FAIL!! For that matter, speakers do not do well at all below their resonant frequency (Fs), anything below that can quickly push a speaker past its mechanical limits.Since a speaker only moves so far, it is a trade-off: low end extension versus output level. You manage it as best you can for the end user\u2019s listening preferences and what the physical install and the budget allows. Try to keep each speaker in the bandwidth it is good at, and filter out as much of what it isn\u2019t; maximize the parts of the physical install you have control of to skew physics in your favor instead of against it (\u2018cause physics don\u2019t care who you are, and physics don\u2019t bend, physics just IS!), and go from there.

            "answer_text": "Yes. The woofer cone moves quite a bit if driven too hard by a large amp. You can damage it in a number of ways, but one I ran into was simply the voice coil hitting the back plate and getting bent. Music with too much bass will not do it alone. For damage you need an amp that is too powerful for the speaker. If the amp is big the speaker should be big also. If it is a good brand and has a high power rating (although these are very dubious) all should be ok. There are two different potentially damaging situations. Very loud for a long time which could cook the voice coil or one big whump from a bass drum with a big amp and the volume too high. If you are going to push the volume there is always the risk of damage. John Wawrzonek ",

            "answer_text": "Speakers can fail in three basic ways. The coils can overheat and short out. Too much power over too long will do this, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s bass or treble, or even sounds you can\u2019t hear.The cones can tear-this is almost always age and trauma related.The suspension elements can break or be dislodged. This can be related to trauma, but it\u2019s the one that bass is likely to be connected too. If a bass note is too loud it can stretch the speaker farther than it\u2019s supposed to go tearing stuff.So, yeah, use a speaker that\u2019s designed for the amount of power and the frequency spectrum you want to put thru it.

            "answer_text": "Speakers can break just like anything else in the world. Playing with too much bass can cause fatigue in the speaker cones over time. The right speaker for the right amp is the best way to go. Bass speakers are made to take the pressure as they accommodate the amps power. A weaker speaker such as a midrange speaker with lower wattage could be overpowered by the amp and cause the speaker to burn out prematurely. Not a good experience for a live gig. When choosing or replacing speakers ask the pros for advice and proper installment. That\u2019s one way to get the best mileage from your speakers. Good luck! ",
