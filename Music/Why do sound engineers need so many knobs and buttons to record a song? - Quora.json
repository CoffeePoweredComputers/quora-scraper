            "answer_text": "When you see a large format mixing desk for the first time, they look crazy! There are more buttons and knobs on there than an aircraft cockpit. Surely simply recording a band isn\u2019t more complicated than operating a 747?  In reality, this is a lot simpler than it looks. When we record a band we end up using a lot of different sound sources. Some will be microphones (recording a drum kit requires a lot of microphones to get a modern sound) some will be direct inputs (things like keyboards) and some will be for additional effects. All these different sound sources require their own input. A large format desk is just lots of these inputs over and over again. Once you\u2019ve learnt how to use one of these input channels, you know how to use the desk. Even very intimidating desks really only have a few features per channel strip, and it\u2019s a lot simpler than you\u2019d think. Basicly all they do is the following, usually from the top to the bottom. Preamp. Lets you control the level coming into the desk.Busses. Lets you send the Audio somewhere (usually to a recording device on a studio desk)Eq. Like the tone control knobs on your hifi, only more specific.Aux sends. Send the signal somewhere else. You can plug these into anything, and effect unit, a musicians headphones, a speaker, whatever you need.Dynamics. Only very top of the range desks have dynamics per channel. Usually simple gates and compressors.Fader. This controls the volume of what you are hearing. Some desks have two sets of faders, one to control the level you are sending to the recording device, and one to control the level coming back from it which you listen to.That\u2019s pretty much it. Once you\u2019ve learnt how to use one big desk, you can pretty much use them all, the basic principles remain the same, only the layout changes slightly. We only need such large desks because some recording projects take up a lot of channels, and we don\u2019t want to run out! The days of the large format desk are numbered though, these days most recordings are mixed purely with software and never go near a desk. Large format desks are ridiculously expensive to buy and maintain and since the money fell out of the music industry, very few people can afford them. ",

            "answer_text": "Live consoles and recording studio consoles look very intimidating, but once you understand the basics it all makes sense. It all has to do with signal flow. Each vertical strip of knobs and faders is for one specific track or channel. This is called a channel strip. The audio signal comes into the preamp from the mic, then into the channel strip on the board. At the top is the gain control which then usually goes into an EQ and/or compressor section of the channel strip. A lot of the knobs are for sending the signal from that channel to other channels or bus tracks to group channels together. Those bus channels can have effects on them and can control a whole group of channels at once. Then at the bottom is usually the pan knob and then the mute button and fader. Those are just some basics. Some consoles have awesome features. Modern Sound consoles and control surfaces also have what\u2019s called automation. You can program knobs and faders to do what you want them to automatically! That\u2019s why mixing back in the day was an art form. Before automation, if your recording had tons of stuff moving around and level changes, you needed multiple people on the board to control all those changes in real time while you recorded the multi track tape down to the stereo master. If one person screwed up, you rewound the tape and did it all over again. And each time that tape ran through the machine again the sound quality would decrease slightly. So these guys had to be really good at it to avoid doing multiple times to keep the tape from suffering. Sometimes you need a lot of those knobs and some times you barely need any of them. But the bigger the recording or the bigger the live show, the more knobs, faders and channels you\u2019ll probably need. A studio buys a board to accommodate the recording needs of clients. As those needs grow, the size and scope of all the equipment in the studio can increase. ",
