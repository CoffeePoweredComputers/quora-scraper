            "answer_text": "Whether you may use copyrighted music legally is a question of law, but there\u2019s also a question of ethics. It\u2019s only fair to give due credit to those who create work. Now to the legal quesstions. There are several ways in which you may use copyrighted music for purposes other than personal enjoyment. Get permission. That usually involves paying a fee.Perform the music yourself in a venue that\u2019s paid the public performance licensing fee for you (taverns and concert halls and schools all pay it).Use it for parody or satire.Use small portions in order to illustrate points you are making if you\u2019re engaged in cricitism, commentary, or academic publication.If you record material from a broadcast, you may copy it and share it with others provided you are not making a profit from the transaction..In formal education you may make limited use. Entire works may be used in face-to-face or online instruction but those who can receive it are supposed to be only enrolled students, relevant staff and authorized guests\u2014in online classes that means password-protected. If making a durable copy for students you\u2019re limited to a small portion of the work, for example one photocopy of one chapter of a textbook per student.In worship services. Note that it must be an actual worship service, not a social activity or concert or other event happening in a church, mosque or synagogue.Those are the somewhat ill-defined parameters. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your usage. 2 cases : Just for fun: If you\u2019re simply making a YouTube video that you don\u2019t wish to monetize, you can use most copyrighted tracks as they\u2019re already registered with YouTube's content id network and the owner of the music will receive all the earnings.Professional: If you\u2019re trying to make original videos for a YouTube channel that you wish to monetize, or a short film/documentary you should strictly stay away from copyrighted music as using such music in a video you\u2019ve put time and efforts in, will have legal consequences sooner or later. It\u2019s better to use royalty free music if you can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t have the budget to hire a musician on sites like upwork. Royalty free music can be paid (one time licenses fees) or free, it depends.No modern art is copyright free. It may have been in the early 18th century, but not anymore. Don\u2019t even consider using other people\u2019s music in your videos if you\u2019re serious about building a career as a YouTuber, Editor or Film producer always hire musicians that will make music specifically for your project only. I repeat again: No modern art is copyright free. It may be distributed for free by the musician to gain exposure but it never is \u201ccopyright free\u201d. ",

If you\u2019re taking someone else\u2019s copyrighted music, adding your own lyrics, and performing or recording it as your song \u2014 no. Simply \u201cgiving credit\u201d isn\u2019t enough; you would need to get written permission from the copyright holder, and split any royalties or earnings with them. ",
