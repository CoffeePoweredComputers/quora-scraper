            "answer_text": "Saam= derived from saamya = means balance but here has been used to mean accord or agreement Daam = price or payment or incentiveDand = punishmentBhed = (creating) division or distinction, (creating) discord Q. How do you deal with people or people groups? A. Through saam-daam-dand-bhed. This is from an old Hindu political strategy manual. Has been attributed to Chankya (2300 years ago), also to Vidur (5500* years ago). As a king of a kingdom you are controlling a population which is a huge group of people, and by-its-nature is divided further into groups and sub-groups. People fight. Groups magnify the fight. Managing people (and populations) becomes a problem. As the king, you take care of the problem by using saam-daam-dand-bhed to manage people-groups. Whatever your action be - your strategy should be governed by either of the four attributes. Some folks say that this strategy framework can also be used to dictate the kingdom\u2019s foreign policy. Saam-daam-dand-bhed as a Modern Management Strategy framework has also been adopted to managing individuals and people groups in a corporate/ professional environment e.g. teams in office, sports teams etc. __ Edit note: minor correction Mahabharat is dated to 3500 BC so c. 5500 years ago not 3500 years ago. I made an inadvertent mistake earlier, correcting now. ",
