            "answer_text": "Depends upon your defination of hit and flop.  There has always been a story behind every reason. You love something for a reason. You give importance to something special over something ordinary; it has a reason. Also, falling for someone has a reason. It doesn\u2019t happen often but whenever it happens, it feels like magic. Love has an emotional touch, it has sensations, boundaries, and feelings. No one has control over how, when or whom you fall in love with but whenever you do you can precisely say that this is love because it is the feeling of one of its kind. Watching Photograph movie will make you feel the same way. The love story does not always mean a lad falling in love with a girl. Their parents disagree, they escape. By reaching the climax, they get accepted by their parents and your screen pops up with the heart whelming note \u201cAnd they lived happily ever after.\u201d Not all the movies are like this. Not Photograph at least. Photograph movie is a love story of two strangers who may not love each other but have a connection of care. Photograph Movie Review - When Campa meets Kulfi Photograph movie is something depicting the realness of a society, a struggle, a pressure, confusion and a connection which thrives with you. Have you ever tried feeling life through someone else\u2019s experience? If not try reading a romantic novel and you will get the idea of what I am talking about. Watching Photograph movie is like reading a book which grows with each chapter. We all know the ending but this is not the low-down. Instead, this becomes a predictable joy. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends upon if you like it or not. Yes, I did go and see the movie Photograph, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Sanya Malhotra. It is directed by Ritesh Batra, the man who gave us the brilliant movie \u2018The Lunchbox\u2019. Here are my top 5 thoughts about the movie, and a little something else that I made for the movie after these 5 thoughts. The movie is slow, which some people might like and some might not. Depends upon taste.The movie is shot beautifully, the city of Mumbai comes alive in the movie.The movie could only have been set in Mumbai, no other city could have done justice to this story.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is flawless, and that\u2019s a bad thing because we really need to give him more challenging characters.The story is nice, but the treatment could have been better. And while those are my top thoughts about the movie, I actually talk about these 5 points and many more in the video analysis that I have made. Here\u2019s the link:  Please let me know in the comments, here on Quora or on the video, if you liked my answer or the video. I hope you also share my thoughts on the movie, and here\u2019s wishing you have a good day. Thank you for reading and watching! Cheers! ",
