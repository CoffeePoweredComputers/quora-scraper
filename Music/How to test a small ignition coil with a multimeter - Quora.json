            "answer_text": "With a cheap unit. Only test you can do is to see if no breaks in the primary or secondary (high voltage side) wiring. Recommendation is to attach the leads then shake the coil hard while looking for the ohms to change to a higher value. A unit to read the high voltage while running is very expensive compared to a multi meter. If ohms changes when shook it is bad. If leads connection is not the problem, like it is loose. Not likely to be able to tell the difference between wires are OK or shorted. BUT if either is shorted, no spark, engine is not able to run. ",
