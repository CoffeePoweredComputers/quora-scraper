            "answer_text": "Allan is right when he says that the best strap is the one that works for you. There is going to be a certain amount of subjectivity to this answer for anyone who decides to weigh in. I can only tell you what works for me and why. First, I have no real physical limitations or obvious weaknesses (like a bad back). Second, I have often practiced for many hours at a time. Third, I am mostly a tenor player. Having noted these things, I have had great success with this strap:  It is made by Oleg Products and is very expensive on their website ($90; it was much less when I bought mine years ago), but I think it\u2019s worth it. It is just so comfortable. It is also very well-made and, though it\u2019s difficult to tell this from the picture, it is extremely durable. The neck pad is a high-grade leather and the cords are some sort of high quality synthetic. The \u201cbuckle\u201d is metal and the hook is a very strong, high-impact plastic. I\u2019ve had two for many years (I swap them out if I sweat through them) and they\u2019ve never broken or worn out. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to swear by the Neo-Tec straps, until I played in a ska band and started to pogo playing bari sax and nearly died when the horn bounced and the mouthpiece tried to stab right between my mouth and nose. I used their shoulder harness through college, just because I was playing bari for upwards of 5\u20136 hours a day between various ensembles and practicing. Having learned that a stretchy neck-strap is a quick visit to the orthodontist, I moved over to one that\u2019s all nylon with a sheep-skin(fur?) lining. Comfortable, sweat absorbent, and the latch is super-fast to unlock and slap onto another horn for a quick change. Not sure if this is the exact one, but if not, its really similar. I also have an old Vandoren V16-branded neck-strap that I don\u2019t hate\u2026 but I find it much harder to adjust and it doesn\u2019t have the extra padding. As I get into my mid-40s, I\u2019m considering going back to the shoulder harness for longer bari-only gigs. I don\u2019t love it for any of the other horns, because it keeps them too high up and in the way, but it was good for bari\u2026 at least, 20 years ago. No idea if I\u2019d still like it all that much now. ",
