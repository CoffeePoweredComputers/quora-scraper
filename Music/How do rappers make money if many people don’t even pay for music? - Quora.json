            "answer_text": "Technically people do pay for music. Streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify cost per month. Then rappers get paid for however much their music was streamed. For most rappers, most of the money they make comes from touring. If you\u2019re a big rapper like Drake, Wayne, J Cole or Kendrick Lamar you can make good money off of sponsorships and appearances. A lot of rappers also make money from the music they post on YouTube and publishing royalties. ",
