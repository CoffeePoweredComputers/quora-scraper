            "answer_text": "Gershwin was influenced by many genres, composers, performers, and American vernacular music. Broadway, jazz, classical, gospel, and folk were part of his upbringing and informed his major works and artistic desire to create music that incorporated rhythmic and harmonic elements (like his famous use of the \u201cblue note\u201d) into classical forms. For Porgy and Bess, he did a year long or so immersion in coastal South Carolina to study regional Gullah music that emanated from churches there. Throughout his life, he studied classical counterpoint and took lessons from many esteemed theorists and composers. Gershwin\u2019s enduring appeal is in part probably that he was receptive to so many influences and much of what he wrote still sound fresh to the ear since it defies easy categorization. Even his Broadway tunes don't sound as maudlin and corny as you\u2019d expect from the lyrics. ",

            "answer_text": "George Gershwin is known for the \u201cjazz\u201d style that he brought to such works as \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d However, Gershwin himself claimed to have been influenced primarily by the French impressionist composers Maurine Ravel and Claude Debussy. Gershwin also claimed to be influenced by Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud (who later was Dave Brubeck\u2019s teacher) and Arnold Schonberg. The latter composers were all considered fairly avant-garde, proponents of 12-tione music and such, so how much Gershwin was actually influenced by them is open to debate. However, Gershwin did study the compositional method of Joseph Schillinger. Schillinger had a method of composition that was based entirely on mathematical processes. It may seem contrary to Gershwin\u2019s style, but it seems to have had a positive effect on Gershwin. ",
