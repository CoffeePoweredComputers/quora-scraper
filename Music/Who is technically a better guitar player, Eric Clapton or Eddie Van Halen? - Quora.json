            "answer_text": "I never cared for Eric Clapton\u2019s music OR guitar playing. I noticed some years ago that the only \u201cClapton\u201d stuff I liked was that which he did as a \u201csideman\u201d Delaney & Bonnie, or as a group with musicians equally as good as, if not better than himself (Cream, Derek & The Dominoes, Blind Faith), and my favorite guitar parts from \u201cDerek\u2026\u201d are surely Duane Allmans. I also think Eric Clapton\u2019s best songs as a solo artist were all songs written by someone else; Bob Marley, JJ Cale\u2026etc. playing \u201csmooth\u201d lead fills on other peoples songs does not necessarily make one a \u201cgreat guitarist\u201d. Eddie, on the other hand was a total original\u2026his playing was so precise without sounding clinical, choppy or staccato (except where intended). His groove on rhythm was in the pocket like very few manage. His finger-tapping was so fluid that not many even try to imitate\u2026its one thing to do \u201cEruption\u201d but to play solos in the pocket of a song, switching between tapping and licks..wow. Technically brilliant and physically gifted. Eddie: fire, flash, speed, precision, fluidity, innovation and showmanship. Eric: old tired blues licks played without emotion. I vote for EVH. ",

            "answer_text": "I will give a different point of view, Even though both are great guitarists, I will say Clapton is the more technically skilled, for the following reason; EVH total body of work is only Rock as far as I can tell he has never stretched outside of the Rock jandra, on the other hand Clapton has stretched beyond Rock and Blues successfully (both financially and technically). He has done reggie, Jazz, classical, and country. Also don\u2019t forget his big 1993 grammy (6) win was a purely acoustic album (Unplugged). Finally if you seen him at his Crossroads (as I did at the first one) he sits in with all different types of guitarists. So over all I will say Clapton is technically a better guitarist primarily because of the total body of work and not focusing on one or two songs written decades apart. ",
