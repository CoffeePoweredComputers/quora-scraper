            "answer_text": "This guitar has a classic tone. The semi-hollowbody makes for more tone, with nice low frequencies. Has a somewhat jazzier sound, although not as much as a full hollowbody. If you're using it for rock with heavy distortion and other effects, it can feedback slightly easier than a solidbody, but not as bad as a full hollowbody. The 335 also has humbucker pickups, which is further into a warm, jazz-like tone, although the humbucker pickups are also quite a bit louder than the single-coil pickups that might come with a Fender Stratocaster or Telecaster. Withe the louder output from the humbucker pickups comes a nice push into a distorted amplifier or overdrive pedal, but smooth tone.  The Gibson ES-335 is quite expensive. There are Epiphone models and other companies that copy the ES-335 that may be much less expensive, and honestly, I don't find the inexpensive models to be a problem. Depends on who you're talking to, but I love the sound of a good Epiphone model, sometimes better than the Gibson counterpart. It really depends on the particular guitar. Some are better than others. Ibanez makes a nice version of this guitar type.  If you like a brighter, Stratocaster or Telecaster-type sound, you don't want the 335. It's a beautiful tone, though. Larry Carlton played one all through the '70s on the many sessions and recordings that he played on, including the Steely Dan tunes(Kid Charlemagne, Black Cow, Don't Take Me Alive, etc.), the Joni Mitchell records(Court & Spark, etc.), Joan Baez, the Crusaders, Hill Street Blues Theme, etc. Larry's tone is one of the most-copied guitar tones of all time.
