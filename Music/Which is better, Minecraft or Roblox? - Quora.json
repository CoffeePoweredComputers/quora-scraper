            "answer_text": "Well that depends, both games have changed significantly. Minecraft I started playing minecraft on mobile around the update 0.3.0. That was in 2012ish. Back then the game was fairly simple and Redstone wasn't on mobile yet. Though I did learn about minecraft by an old friend who surprisingly also showed me Roblox. So yeah. Growing up I was watching minecraft videos all the time, be it from the Yogscast or TheBajanCanadian and even SkyDoesMinecraft (back when he did mod reviews). After a while my parents let me buy it on our craptop. I'll post a link later to a video of me playing it back then. But I played that all summer one year and my obsession was rampant. Keep in mind this was during my break from Roblox that I've mentioned in another answer. I didn't have many friends to play with back then, but I know play with some of my high school friends on our own server, and it's pretty fun. That's as brief as I'll get, I could write multiple pages on it. Roblox This game was my childhood, primarily due to the fact it was free. I grew up playing it much more, and learned quite a bit from it. Through Roblox I've made countless friends from the role-playing community (ww2 one). These include guys like Judeycakes and Colby, pretty much my only two remaining Roblox friends, and I play other games with them. My knowledge of history was expanded when I learned about the depth of ww2 beyond what I learned from my dad. Most of my memories were forgotten but lots reside in my old youtube channels. I'll link them. In the end it had a lot more replayabilitiy Conclusion I'll say Roblox was better. I say was because I refuse to play in the current state that it is in. I do still enjoy minecraft but I can't seem to play it without friends. Roblox was a game where I could always go back to with a different experience each time. ",

You might make money off of it!Fun to play with friends!YES. A MUTE BUTTON.Roblox Negative: Need wifi to play.Need to buy Builders Club or gamepasses to have more access in Roblox.In the Home Page. Not very many good games. Most of them are just plain \u201cRP\u201d. So if your a serious teenager looking for good gaming in Roblox, ask me anytime.BOTS. Seriously! THEY\u2019RE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!1111111CHAINS. I swear, the ones I hate the most! \u201cRepost this image in order to sound like Donald Trump\u201d. Ridiculous!\u201cSave your girlfriend obby! Fall down in a 10,0000000000000 gazillion hole!\u201d. Misleading pages? More like clickbait.OD (Online Dating). Seriously man. This is why I\u2019m a doge in the game.Horrible gameplay in Mobile.Every now and then. IT CRASHES.Myths and Hoaxes made by a frickin 6 year old. (Ex: Guest 666)Minecraft Positive: No wifi needed!Play with friends!Creativity.The damned thing just keeps updating. Wow.Very noice graphicsSurvival Based game. I personally love survival games. It would be cooler if it was like an Apocalypse mod. Just my opinion.Speaking of mods. There is so MANY OF THEM. One I love is the TNT mod.Ahhhhh\u2026. Peace\u2026..Minecraft Negative: Pay to play. (About 27 USD for Java edition, about 8 USD for Bedrock Edition/Pocket Edition, And about 20 USD for certain Legacy console editions. 1 United States Dollar is 0.78 Pound Sterling, 1.43 Australian Dollar, 1.50 New Zealand Dollar, 1.33 Canadian Dollar, 0.69 Irish Pound, 0.88 Euro, 108.18 Japanese Yen and 6.91 Chinese Yuan. Feel free to add your country\u2019s currency.)Gets boring after a while.Not so realistic, maybe that\u2019s just my opinion because Roblox isn\u2019t realistic either.Minecraft PE now requires you to have an Xbox live account to buy from the store or play multiplayer.Yea that\u2019s pretty much it. Maybe because I don't play it so much. I\u2019ll ask a friend! Update May 8th 2018: A friend told me \u201cIt\u2019s like a perfect game\u201d. Great\u2026 Yes Roblox has more frustrating things but I still play it. If your a Roblox player, feel free to add me: Masterchiefkevin Hoped it helped! ",
