            "answer_text": "Hello, I'd love to say, over time you'll develop that skill on your own, but you won't, well, it's possible but unlikely. So let me give you some tips and tricks I followed earlier on in my musical career: 1. Work on rhythm, A song is nothing without a rhythm and hence work on that first, There are plenty of lessons dealing with this matter, do a search to the right for the keywords. Also practicing with metronome is essential, starting at very low tempos and then increase the tempo. Back in the old day's I was also playing a lot to records along with my favourite artists. A good idea today might be to always practice to some kind of rhythm, eg. a drum pattern or metronome, if you can't play any instrument even at a basic level try clapping to the rhythm and singing with your lyrics to the beat. 2. Sing it, a lot. When you are done with the lyrics and beat, keep singing it to yourself, at a medium- loud voice. This way your ears get used to it and it's easier to make improvements and adjustments. 3. Work as a group If you can't play an instrument, your best bet is to get someone who can. That way not only do you get an instrument player, you get additional perspective. 4. Learn Tablature or better yet, learn to read music. This way you'll be able to identify when a note is supposed to hit(rhythm), learn what note goes after the previous one(this is quite complicated to explain, but you'll know after you learn it yourself), it's possible to compliment one type of tone with another, adding this to your lyric will produce a 4x improvement compared to just the lyric and singular, linear tone. [Please excuse the vague explanation] 5. Next time, try working on the music first When you are able to put words to music its much easier. I've been writing lyrics for over 5 years, but only in the past 2 have I been able to put words to music. Trust me its much easier this way, and even makes it more efficient in a commercial setup, many bands do this- Simply because, if you get stuck on the words of a song, you can get some new beats or riffs out then go back to the previous one. Hope I helped. p.s. This maybe just me but if I have to write some music, I avoid listening to other, already produced music, other than the stuff I am working on, this helps me have a clear head. ",

            "answer_text": "Many ways. John Lennon got the words for \u201cBeing For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\u201d from an old circus poster. Most love songs can be inspired by a lover, or prospective lover. Eric Clapton wrote \u201cLayla\u201d about his best friend\u2019s wife, Patti Harrison. When you get an idea, you write down what you feel. Sometimes the melody comes first. Paul McCartney dreamed the melody to \u201cYesterday\u201d. Until he came up with words, he called it \u201cScrambled Eggs\u201d. After you have words and a melody, you work on rhyme schemes. It\u2019s not always mandatory that each line rhymes, but, it usually works out better and is more memorable if they come close. Many songs are ungrammatical because you use words in a way that forms a rhyme rather than a totally grammatical way. Some people don\u2019t follow these rules at all. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote songs differently. Bernie wrote the lyrics as poems. He gave them to Elton, who put them to music. There are as many ways to write songs as there are songwriters. These are a few. ",
