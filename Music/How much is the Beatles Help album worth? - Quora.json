            "answer_text": "It depends on what condition its in, and what version  you have. Assuming you have the original 1965 MONO Parlophone release PMC1255 you could get at least 200 Euros for it (using current prices on the Discogs marketplace) assuming its in Mint or Near Mint condition Help! (Vinyl) at Discogs Marketplace However if its not in such good condition, it might be worth only 5 -10 Euros. Its not a record that is in any way rare, so it needs to be in excellent condition There are other versions of the release that can be valuable too. For example the first pressing of the French release \"Chansons Du Film \"Help!\"  Help! (Vinyl) at Discogs Marketplace ",
