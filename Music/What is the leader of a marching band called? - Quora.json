            "answer_text": "It depends. If it\u2019s the teacher, he or she is the Band Director. If it\u2019s your main person in the band who conducts in the middle, that\u2019s your Head Drum Major. There\u2019s a somewhat complex hierarchy in a band, but those are your two highest ranks. You also have the assistant Band Directors, the Guard Director, the other two (or three) drum majors, all of the Captains and Co-Captains, the Alumni, and the Vets. Lots of people to keep track of, really. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean. The for sure leader would be the director, since she/he controls everything in the band. but the other option could be the drum majors, who conduct the band and are an essential part to allowing the band sound successful. They are also a substitute for if the director is not there. ",
