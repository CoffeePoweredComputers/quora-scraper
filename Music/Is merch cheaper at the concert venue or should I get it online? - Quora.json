            "answer_text": "Good question in a sea of stupidity. Thank you. My honest and very real answer to your question is. It depends on the act, the promoter and the venue. In common practice, Artists hire managers because they don\u2019t want to deal with the endless onslaught of contractual obligations that come with the reality of concert touring. The modern day presentation of a performing artist requires team work, much like a NASCAR race team and much of it , you never see. Everyone has a job which they specialize in and do well.The audience never sees 80% of the negotiations, compromises and settlements that go on back stage before, during and after a show. I hate to generalize but in this case I will for your education. When it comes to SWAG/ Merch, often times it is written into the contract for that date that the venue will take a percentage of the total merch sales on site during the contractual show period. Usually one day. In exchange, the venue often provides an employee to sell the merch, even if the act carries a merch person on the tour. The total product is counted in and recorded at the beginning of the day. It is inventoried and counted out at the end of the day. The difference in numbers is presented at final settlement. The promoter rep, venue management and artist\u2019s tour managers revue numbers and money goes to the appropriate places. That\u2019s what happens as you\u2019re on your way home from the show and/or partying the night away. That\u2019s why you never get freebies unless you flash your tits and beg pretty please. Sorry, my touring smart ass reared it\u2019s ugly head\u2026.LOL The merch guy/gal has to pay for the freebie you scored. As a concert fan, I would encourage you to do this. Look at your favorite performer\u2019s website. They will most likely sell SWAG there. Look at the prices and compare them to the prices at the SWAG booth on the show day in your city. If it\u2019s cheaper online, you can always wait and buy it when you get home unless your case of \u201cI wants in NOW\u201d overrides your sobriety. The bottom line is, there is no standard answer. It changes with every city, every venue, every promoter and every contract. I won\u2019t blame it all on the venues or promoters. Some Artists mark up the cost of their SWAG/Merch to cover the costs of the venue\u2019s cut. In fairness, I\u2019ll ask you. If someone was taking 10% of the sales of your widget, would you not mark up your prices to account for that?Every show. Every city. Every promoter. Every concert venue. Ever day on tour is a unique experience. If you knew even half of what the people who do that for a living know and sacrifice to entertain you, you would have a far different view of the industry as a whole.Keep on rockin\u2019 or stompin\u2019 or whatever trips your trigger :) ",

            "answer_text": "It varies, but you'll save on shipping if nothing else when you buy from the artist at the venue. The best reason to buy at the venue, however, is that most of the money from merch sales goes directly to the band / artist. Some bands / artists make most of their money at a show on merch sales. So, buy something, anything from the band if you like them. ",
