            "answer_text": "Seeing other answers didn\u2019t really solve your question, I came here to give you some practical advice. 1.Scales selection. The basic scales are minor scales. What I mean by minor scales are not only those natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor but also all scales whose pitch interval between the first and third note is minor three. Like Ionian scale, phyrigianScale ,etc. The minor three can build a dark and even grim atmosphere. Phrygian mode:  Ionian mode:  Example: Fade to black by Metallica using Phrygian and natrual scales in solo. Want to write dark songs? You should not miss it. 2. Rhythm selection. You should avoid swing, reggae rhythm, emphasis notes on strong beat. But rhythm had better be not so fast, at least at the beginning. Example: EnterSandam by Metallica applying many notes on strong beat. 3. Study and experience those classic dark ambient songs. No matter how excelled you are at those scales and chords, what dicides if you can successfully write dark ambient song is your feeling and understanding of Dark ambient songs. You can first listen to these rock bands: Lacrimosa, Remmstein, Blacksabbth, led Zeppelin , Metallica. I hope my answer can contribute to your ability to write songs. Thank you very much! Want some more systematic and wonderful music anwsers , follow me! I\u2019ll write one brilliant answer every day! ",

            "answer_text": "Me and a friend started a year ago, but we\u2019re very unproductive since my friend lives far away, so we do like 1\u20133 songs per year or something. What we do it basically twist the hell out of synthesizer knobs and samples, mix stuff, lots of pads, no happy go lucky upbeat melodies.Many samples of just sound (like wind, ocean, caves, etc) which can then be pitched down darker, stretched out, and mixed even more. Add samples here and there that sounds dark, add dissonant instruments, sounds and melodies that sounds creepy\u2026 etc. This is like\u2026 the basics at least, if you wanna know how to properly do it like pro\u2019s,, then you should probably ask people like Lustmord, Atrium Carceri, and other popular names in the dark ambient scene. I can also recommend to dig around on the reddit.* https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAmbientMusic/* https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAmbient/Here are 2 reddit pages worth checking out for inspiration and answers. :) hope to hear your material one day!Mine goes by the name Project Garm (can find us on spotify, itunes, youtube, etcetera.. only 3 songs,, like i said, we\u2019re not very productive :P) ",

            "answer_text": "Also, don\u2019t forget the possibilities of manipulating recordings, and also adding atmospheres and ambiance. Some examples could be clanking industrial resonance; recordings from the insides of drainpipes; wind blowing through a cemetery; clanking windchimes; lonely buoys; and the ever-popular children playing motif. As far as composing/playing, use a synth pad with a long attack and delay (the aforementioned \u2018ooos\u2019), and use a lot of effects modulation, like having various LFOs controlling filter frequency, intensity, and resonance. This gives a slowly evolving effect, which is useful in Dark Ambient, as the music tends to be rather slow-going, with lots of droned-out sustained sounds, which can become dull if not tweaked at all.

            "answer_text": "I haven't written any type of music, so don't hold this over my head if I'm wrong. I would go with whatever you feel at the moment. Bach wrote some right off the top of his head, and that piece is still considered one of the greatest pieces of music of all time. It may take a while to put together, but by writing down the chords and notes as you feel them, then later putting them together to make sure that the piece actually goes well together and sounds like a dark piece, maybe even as dark as the bottom of a cavern that hasn't seen light in millions of years dark, you will not only build up your ability to write dark music, but maybe even multiple types of genres. Just remember, the music is in your soul. Not on just on the radio. Good luck, and I hope that I have helped a bit. ",
