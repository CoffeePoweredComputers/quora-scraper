            "answer_text": "Cadences are great motivators when done properly and with someone who knows how to sound off. Strange thing was, in Basic at Ft Benning, our Senior Drill SSgt did not believe we (2nd Platoon) \u201cearned\u201d the right to have cadences since in his eyes we were always screwing up. We looked at the other 3 platoons with great envy who were having a joyous time sounding off while marching. When our most seasoned Drill SSgt, Drill SSgt E marched us he would use cadences with us. And wow! He can belt it. He had bass, authority when he spoke, and was your quintessential Drill SSgt. He had 2 cadences that he would use with us that even now, 9 years later, still sends shivers up my spine. The first: \u201cI hear the Choppers Coming\u201d (or Airborne Ranger) I hear the choppers coming/they\u2019re hovering over head They\u2019ve come to get the wounded/they\u2019ve come to get the dead Airborne. Ranger. I\u2019m sitting in a foxhole/sharpening my knife Out comes the enemy!/I had to take his life. Airborne. Ranger. My buddy\u2019s in a foxhole/With a bullet in his head. The Medic says he\u2019s wounded/I believe he\u2019s dead Airborne. Ranger.  The second: Patch on my shoulder 82nd/Patch on my shoulder. Pick up your chutes and follow me/Airborne Infantry One-oh-one/Screaming Eagles. Pick up your ropes and follow me/Air Assault Infantry 25th/Patch on my shoulder Pick up your rucks and follow me/Light Fighter Infantry 10th Mountain/Patch on my shoulder Pick up your rucks and follow me/Mountain Infantry.  Now, each Drill SSgt had a different version of these. There are many more out there, but these two in particular stand out the most. There is something about being in Basic, being exposed to cadences for the first time that you FEEL the reality of being in the Army. You sensed the power behind his voice and his words. The grim truth of the military life, the camaraderie associated with it, and the great history that comes from serving. When I got to AIT in Ft Sam Houston , we had fellow Soldier-Medics doing cadences and it just did not sound right. Not to mention, they were saying the same ones over and over again. You get sick of cadences real quick. Come to think of it, when I went to my unit in Ft Bliss, I don\u2019t remember EVER doing cadences. Side note: I\u2019ve met soldiers who told me that their Drill SSgt\u2019s used a Sponge-bob Square Pants cadence. I\u2019ve never experienced it so, I am unable to comment about it. But it would\u2019ve been interesting sounding off to that. ",
