            "answer_text": "Ian Malcolm said a phrase in Jurassic Park that absolutely applies here. We spent so much time wondering if we could, we never thought about whether or not we should. That's a paraphrase, but it falls on the right note If you have the money and parts, all automotive systems can be changed. You can upgrade many things. I considered doing this same mod on my 97 Monte Carlo. Then, when I was having a billing meeting with my lawyer, the idea came out and she told me \u201cyou do that, and we are done\u201d. Sarah understood already what I'm about to tell you. Modify your braking system, and then get in an accident. You'll be amazed how quickly have nothing left. Even if you're doing a major upgrade, like going to a superior foundation system, as soon as the plaintiff's lawyer finds out about it, you're toast. To extend the idea, let's look at a dealer installed situation. I work at a Navistar Dealer. Prostar's come with a parking brake system on one (out of three) axles. A customer of a friend of mine who works at a Peterbilt Dealer wanted to put parking brakes on his second drive axle, so he asked me to write a request to the engineers. I did, and they came back with the same thing. They were not willing to take part in modifying a braking system where they might become liable. Drum brakes aren't that bad if you practice a little, and there is a lot of free information on how to maintain them. Hold off, save your money, and buy something with 4 wheel disc down the line. I'd hate to see you lose everything over an automotive project. ",

If you have ABS or any other exciting braking gismos you may have to change the brake master cylinder and other brake stuff. You MUST inform your insurers as it may void your insurance and depending on where you live, it may break Construction and Use regulations. If you want better brakes, you are probably better off and safer to change your car. Your brakes are quite capable of ending your life suddenly. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is to prepare everything and that includes draining half of the brake fluid from the master cylinder and loosening the lug nuts on the wheel where you will remove the brake drum from. Lift up the vehicle with a jack and remove the tire. When you are prepared to convert drum brakes to disc, follow these next steps: Step 1 \u2013 Find a small round clip on the wheel stud if the car is a rear-wheel drive and remove it. Turn the adjuster wheel inside the access hole, which must be on the backing plate or the brake drum, and loosen the drum. Finally, remove it from its socket. If the vehicle is a front-wheel drive, detach the wheel bearings and the bearing cap in order to be able to disconnect the brake drum. Step 2 \u2013 This step of the drum to disc conversion is about disconnecting the brake shoes. After the removal, unfasten all the hardware attached to the shoes including the screw assembly, springs, and retainer rings. Examine closely the condition of the spindle. Clean the dirt and rust or replace if it is worn out. Step 3 \u2013 Now, it\u2019s time to attach the disc brakes. But, you have to connect the rotor to the spindle first by fastening the nuts and bearings. Secure the brake pads by placing the caliper assembly on top of the rotor and fastening the brake lines. Wrap this step up by installing the parking brake cable inside the caliper piston. When you are finished securing every last screw and bolt, refill the master cylinder with fresh brake fluid. ",

Bear in mind, you will also need a method of applying the brakes with the handbrake. Most vehicles with rear disks have smaller drum units for the handbrake. It isn\u2019t just a case of undoing a couple of bolts and replacing an assembly. The whole rear hubs are usually completely different. ",

            "answer_text": "With difficulty. Unless a later model of a similar car was made which can offer up a suitable axle or axle stubs to take calipers and disks, you\u2019re in trouble. You\u2019ll also need to incorporate stops and mountings for handbrake cables. There\u2019s then the question of whether it\u2019s worth it. Most cars have a static weight bias to the front of the car - on FWD cars this can be in excess of 60%. Under hard braking the weight transfer is to the front which means that the rear tyres and the rear brakes are, in fact, doing next to nothing, almost like performing a \u201cstopie\u201d on a motorcycle.

Otherwise the work is complicated and no worth for the result. Moreover, a drum brake works better than a disk brake. Being the latter needed, only at high speed to drain the big amount of heat generated by the braking. For vehicles that reach moderate speed, up to 160 km/h, a mixed plant (front discs, rear durms) is better than an all discs system. ",
