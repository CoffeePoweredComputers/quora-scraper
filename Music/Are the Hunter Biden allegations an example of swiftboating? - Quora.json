            "answer_text": "Most definitely. Swiftboating refers to the practice of greatly inflating and distorting an event to smear a politician for political gain, named after the campaign of attack ads designed to make John Kerry look like a backstabbing Vietnam apologist during the 2004 Presidential campaign. Republicans have similarly spun a false narrative around Hunter Biden's Board position on a Ukranian gas company's Board designed to smear Joe Biden. Simply perusing the myriad fact checks around the Hunter Biden narrative reveals the depth of the deception (ex. Hunter Biden Archives - FactCheck.org). The fact checks (and detailed news reporting) make clear that the sequence of events around Joe Biden's role in ousting a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine were part of ongoing US policy to address corruption in Ukraine, a critical ally in the front against Russian aggression. While Hunter Biden's board position does raise ethical concerns, they are in no way comparable to the much larger conflicts and ethical concern raised by Trump's family's continued business throughout areas of the world for Trump is making economic policy and imposing sanctions. The relatively modest $50k/month salary Hunter Biden received for his role as a corporate board member is a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars of business that Trump and his family have conducted all over the world that raised exactly the same kind of conflict of interest and ethics concerns, and unlike Hunter Biden's role, the Trump conflicts continue unabated daily. This fact alone reveals that the concerns about corruption in Ukraine I really just attacks on Biden. The fact that people now consider a hunter Biden's roll a something that's comprable to do much more problematic corruption conflicts of interest and ethical issues with Trump's family business dealings suggest that this particular smear has been somewhat successful. in the months after the impeachment hearings when it appeared that Joe Biden was not going to be Democratic candidate, we heard nothing from the Republicans about concerns of corruption revolving around Hunter Biden. The day after Biden's surge to first place in the South Carolina primary, Hunter Biden was once again a topic of great interest. This is a classic example of swiftboating. ",

            "answer_text": "please remember where the term swift-boating came from. John Kerry (D) is running for president. A MAJORITY of the military veterans who served directly with John Kerry, felt he was unqualified for the presidency and they stated this publicly! This is extraordinary! Think of our political climate, where could you find a majority of people going against the media, going against the democrat party machine, sticking their necks out and be open to such vile attacks as occurred? You can\u2019t find that. Think of our American revolution, only about 1/3 of the people were eager to break away from the British. Here was an absolute majority of military veterans, who had directly served with John Kerry (D) who publicly stated he was unqualified. After this the media created this term swift-boating, to claim this was a smear against a candidate, it wasn\u2019t it was men willing to risk everything to stop an unqualified candidate! As to investigating Hunter Biden, there is oral testimony from several sources about his crimes, there is written testimony about his crimes. The crimes should be investigated! There is no reason these crimes shouldn\u2019t be investigated. Therefore let\u2019s conduct a full investigation, determine what crimes were committed, and then determine if they are serious enough to warrant arrest, a trial and imprisonment. By the way, it may be that after a proper investigation it is found that Hunter Biden was essentially jay-walking. If that\u2019s true exonerate him, publish it and end of story. However, my guess, with all the hot air from Joe Biden (D), that there are real crimes and Joe Biden (D) doesn\u2019t want the truth about his own corruption coming out! Investigate the crimes and publish the facts with or without a trial, as appropriate! ",

            "answer_text": "To me there is absolutely no denying that Hunter made millions of dollars based on Joe\u2019s Vice President position. The only question is whether anything criminal was done and if we really want to spend a couple of million dollars on an investigation. Then there is the question of whether Joe did anything criminal to help his son. I think President Obama needs to be subpoenaed to see if Joe had the authorization to do some of the things he did in Ukraine. And finally I would love to know if Ambassador Yovanovitch was working behind the scenes to help Hillary. In any of these situations I do not see any swiftboating techniques. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Swiftboating involves digging up a bunch of people from someone\u2019s past to contradict the narrative they\u2019ve created about themselves. On the one hand, it may provide illumination about aspects of someone\u2019s past that they\u2019d rather keep hidden, thereby shedding light on their character. On the other hand, most public people have people in their past who didn\u2019t like them for one reason or another and it would be possible to accuse those people of sour grapes, dragging down someone they resent for going further than they did. The Swiftboating of Kerry did not take because the technique is infallible, but because the Swiftboaters\u2019 characterizations of Kerry rang true enough with their perceptions of him from other things to stick. The big problem for Kerry is that he had highlighted his military experience and medals and done the \u201cReporting for Duty\u201d shtick at the Democratic convention. The thing about Swiftboating is it only works if the people from one\u2019s past seem to have a more credible take on what you\u2019re about than what you have presented. Had Kerry presented himself as the guy who came back from Vietnam and threw away his medals because he had always stood against wars fought senselessly, and wanted to make sure the war in Iraq wasn\u2019t just a pointless mess for a new generation, the Swiftboaters might have rallied those who hated Kerry anyway but they wouldn\u2019t have caused others to look at whether Kerry was opportunistic or even hypocritical in invoking his military experience because the Kerry they presented wouldn\u2019t have been that different from the Kerry he he himself presented. This is why Donald Trump gets away with so much: We all know he was a sleazy businessman, self-promoter and womanizer. Hell, that\u2019s how he played himself on national television. It\u2019s all fine and good to tell people he\u2019s a horrible person, but everyone knows that and his supporters have made their peace with it. (I say this as someone who will probably vote for him this fall, fwiw). Now that we\u2019ve seen what Swiftboating is, it\u2019s clear that Hunter Biden isn\u2019t about Swiftboating. For one thing, Joe Biden has always been the consummate Washington insider. That\u2019s why Obama chose him as VP. For another, he\u2019s long been joked about as the Senator from MBNA - the suggestion he hangs out with people who have money to pass around is not new. Further, Biden is not running as a reform candidate eager to drive the corruption from politics. That\u2019s Bernie. Biden is running as the guy who will get things back to normal in Washington after the craziness of Trump. Hunter Biden is, more than anything else, a reminder of the corrupt side of business as usual in Washington, the business as usual that caused people to take a chance on Trump. Going after Hunter Biden is not about digging up some unknown\u2019s from Biden\u2019s path to make us wonder if he\u2019s really who he says he is. It\u2019s about noting that under business as usual in Washington, people close to power get wealthy without really bringing a lot to the table and that\u2019s part of what Biden would bring back and he doesn\u2019t seem to see anything wrong with that. And let\u2019s be honest, if you can\u2019t defend yourself on that one when you\u2019re running against the father of Don Jr, Erik and Ivanka, you\u2019ve got no business running. ",

With the benefit of hindsight I would say that John Kerry\u2026aka Swiftboat Veterans target\u2026deserved it. Swiftboating was about cowardly or treasonous conduct with the enemy. There is some compelling evidence of this. Joe Biden is just an example of Barack Obama\u2019s bagman. Perhaps that\u2019s a crude analogy yet it fits with translation. Joe is no doubt a very cultured man compared to me. I am neculturny embodied. But Joe is actually a rather crude man. Had his own way for far too many years. I have the same problem. ",
