            "answer_text": "there are a lot of easy raps to audition with in Kpop, in a lot of different styles too! I would say that if you are auditioning for a company like YG or SM, you might want to go with a little bit harder rap because they really value talent. If you were auditioning for a company like JYP, or BIG HIT. Then I would say go with something more your style, that you would want to sing on stage. I don\u2019t know your music taste, so I will include a few popular groups that have different rapping styles, and what companies I think you should audition for with those songs. BTS (Solo, and group songs): Suga & J-hopes rap from boy with luv, J-hope\u2019s daydream airplane or hope world, J-hope\u2019s rap from lights. (I would audition for a smaller company with BTS songs because the bigger companies, especially big hit might think that you are just a Kpop super fan and that you are just auditioning for the fame) TXT: the rap from crown or cat and dog ( I would say you could probably audition for any company with a txt song) BlackPink: Playing with fire or boombayah ( any company but big hit and YG. Big Hit because BlackPink is BTS\u2019s main rival for popularity, and YG might just think that you are just another super fan) EXO: Monster or love shot ( Like TXT I think you could audition for any company with these songs) Stray Kids: Get Cool, I am you, or awkward silence (any Company except for the top 3 [JYP, SM, YG]) Itzy: Icy or Dalla Dalla (any company except JYP) Twice: One More Time, Cheer Up, Like Ohh Ahh, TT, Jelly (There were a lot more, but I narrowed it down by a few) (pretty much any company except JYP, SM, and YG) As you can see, there is a bit of a pattern\u2026 But good luck in your audition and I hope that this helps you pick a song!
