            "answer_text": "My aunt in law. She got motor neurone disease and died within 5 months. She hurt everyone around her and was a massive narcissist. She caused a massive rift in my family and raised her kids so badly and gave them so little boundaries she allowed them to be sexually abused by their grandfather as children. One of her daughters ended up being so messed up she got into a car with 5 strange men she didn\u2019t know and got raped. Her decisions that night led her down a very dark path that nobody should ever have to suffer. It was obviously the fault of the rapists that that happened to her, but she couldn\u2019t have possibly made any worse decisions to put herself in that position, if her mother had actually cared about raising her children to be good people with moral values maybe they wouldn\u2019t be who they are today. So so sad. She was horrible to both of my parents and also myself. When she was dying I spent a lot of time with her and one day she said something really cruel that made me see her true colours once again. I didn\u2019t see her after that. I thought she mellowed once she became ill but it was just an act to try and make up for all she had done because she was scared of what would happen after she died. She was right to be. I feel sorry for her family, they\u2019re screwed up for life thanks to her. ",

            "answer_text": "If it hasn\u2019t yet, it will. But you need to understand two things about karma: (1) We ARE our karma, so we cannot escape the consequences of how we have made ourselves, through the actions, words, thoughts and feelings we have done. Karma means \u201cimprint\u201d, so everything we do, every second we live, is either creating new imprints in our being (soul, subconscious brain) OR is strenthening existing imprints. Sooner or later, WHO/HOW we have made ourselves into WILL draw similar people (and situations) to ourselves. Since we cannot escape ourselves, we cannot escape the consequences of how we have made ourselves into. ALL self-centered actions, words, thoughts and emotions create negative imprints that draw something negative to us. ALL compassionate and caring actions, words, thoughts, and emotions create positive imprints that draw something postiive to us. (2) What you need to understand is that YOUR desire for someone who harmed you TO suffer harm themselves, is creating negative imprints/karmas in YOU. Let go of your resentment instead. Develop compassion, because the unhappier someone is, the more selfish their actions are. We are all unhappy to some extent and wish to escape that \u2026YOU know that from your own experience. Well, the person who hurt you is just the same, except they are suffering even more, and don\u2019t inow how to stop it. So have some compassion for your own hurt, but also for the other person. Refuse to dwell on resentment or on hopes that they will suffer, because you don\u2019t want to create more suffering/bad imprints (bad karmas) for yourself. And let go, beause you want to create postiive imprints that will result in good things for you. Even if you don\u2019t believe in karma per se, modern science supports the concept that our actions (both inner and outer) create imprints in our brain that control how we act and feel, and that draw or repel other people. So karma DOES indeed operate, although maybe not quite as extensively as ancient Eastern cultures thought. ",
