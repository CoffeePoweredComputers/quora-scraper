            "answer_text": "Absolutely Every single new song on the planet is garbage. No one writes their own music anymore and they use autotune which makes them sound like keyboards. Nowadays music is concentrated on catchiness and \u2018artists\u2019 don\u2019t write from the soul. Current rappers wouldn\u2019t send a good message, they\u2019d just talk about drugs and being racist to others. Songs don\u2019t have a nice message. They have a stupid message. All of the younger generation are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button and they all have the attention spans of ants. For example, that \u2018Dancing Monkey\u2019 song (or whatever it is called) sounds like nothing from the past. All new songs are meaningless Look at the lyrics of Aretha Franklins \u2018Natural Woman\u2019 song Looking out on the morning rainI used to feel so uninspiredAnd when I knew I had to face another dayLord, it made me feel so tiredBefore the day I met you, life was so unkindBut you're the key to my peace of mind 'Cause you make me feelYou make me feelYou make me feel likeA natural woman (woman) and compare them to the latest hit song by the Jonas Brothers She said \"Ooh, ooh, ooh\"Kiss me like your ex is in the roomDon't you be afraid of something newIf you play it right, you can be that someoneYeah, that someone whoWon't leave me lonely tonight Yeah yeah yeahYeah yeah yeahYeah Ooh la laMake a move, yeah, baby by last callFull moon night with the lights offBaby your eyes glow (yeah)Don't know why, but I feel like I'ma go psycho (psycho)Ooh la laIf it's cool, yeah, baby I'd like to WHAT THE HECK DOES THIS MEAN? Old music never used autotune AT ALL too, but old music did use a kind of autotune (not used that much) which was vocoders. And also the instruments Look at the amount of instruments in the Beatles \u2018Day In The Life\u2019 acoustic guitar, piano, bass guitar, maracas drums, congas, harmonium, violin, viola, cello, double bass, harp, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, flute, French horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba, timpani, tambourine And compare them to Old Town Road by Lil X Banjo, trap-style Roland TR-808 drum machine and bass. That shows that Lil X and his producing team were downright LAZY That\u2019s why old music is better than new music ",

            "answer_text": "Well in a way yes, but also no. There is still good music being made, it\u2019s just that primary motivation these days has changed. The old motivation for the creation of music used to be the Creation itself. In other words, human beings who loved to create music created it, and because they loved to create, it was good. In olden days, these humans who love to create music were called by all sorts of names. Bards, poets, musicians, etc. Today, they are called singer-songwriters, and there are indeed still good singer-songwriters because as long as the Creation lives, there will be humans who show love for it through their creations, which in turn enriches the Creation itself. However, by today, it\u2019s the case that for many, many people, the new motivation for the creation of music is profit, because the music industry will pay out huge sums for banal, boring stuff. As a result, the people who produce most of today\u2019s music are not doing it for the Creation itself, and they are not doing it because they love the act of creating, but are instead just involved in it for the money and fame they can get.
