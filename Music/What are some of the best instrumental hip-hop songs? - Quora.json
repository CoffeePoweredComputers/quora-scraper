            "answer_text": "Fans of  Mad Men will immediately recognize RJD2's \"Beautiful Mine,\" which appears in the opening credits of the show. RJD2 collaborated with rapper Aceyalone on the underground album Magnificent City. After its release, he put out a separate instrumental album, The Magnificent City Instrumentals.   Fans of the Breaking Bad might recognize the Beastie Boys' \"Shambala,\" which appeared on the soundtrack for the third season. It originally appeared the Beastie's fourth album, Ill Communication. During the mid-1990s, Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Yauch got into Buddhism and Tibetan culture, right as the Beastie's refashioned themselves as a groove-influenced rap band. This combines both. It opens with Tibetan Buddhist chants, then breaks into the funk instrumental.   Macklemore & Ryan Lewis (yes, the \"Thrift Shop\" guys) put one of the most beautiful and inspired instrumentals I've heard in recent years on their album, The Heist. The song is called \"Bombom.\"   \"Building Steam With A Grain of Salt\" is the second song from DJ Shadow's celebrated debut album \"Endtroducing.\"  Shadow's method is to construct songs from loads of obscure samples (rumored as many as 20 samples in a single track). Six samples were chopped up and mixed into this masterpiece.   \"Forrest Crunk\" originally appeared on Aesop Rock's Daylight EP. Produced by Blockhead, it later appeared on the limited edition version of Blockhead's Music by Cavelight album.    El-P's beats are in a class of their own, particularly his production on Cannibal Ox's debut album, The Cold Vein. Like RJD2, he released a separate album called El-P Presents The Cannibal Oxstrumentals, which showcases the instrumentals from The Cold Vein. This song is \"Pigeon\" R\u00f6yksopp isn't actually a hip-hop band, but I'll be damned if \"Eple\" isn't a hip-hop song. It originally appeared on their debut album, Melody A.M. This one has appeared on various TV shows.  ",

            "answer_text": "I guess you can break this into two categories, amazing sounding instrumentals and intricate instrumentals, but I think that the others have done a good job of covering intricate instrumentals, so for these purposes amazing sounding should suffice :). I'll give a few of my personal favorites (in no particular order). I'll also try to restrict my list to songs from the past few years (won't be easy to do) because, again, the other answers are on point and have done a good job taking it back to the past.   1)  Deeper - Freddie Gibbs (Pinata, 2014)   Madlib never fails to disappoint. This song has a really 90's vibe and beat. The strings (I think it's violin) and the electronic type sounds, along with the sample from A Fool For You by The Ledgends make this beat really unique in the sense that it could stand by itself and many artists could take it and run with it (I would love to hear G-Unit on this beat).   2) Studio - Schoolboy Q (Oxymoron, 2014)   Oh man, this beat is really amazing. The drums are really catchy and the bassline matches them perfectly. That, coupled with the electronic riff from the synthesizer (it sounds like?) and the sample of the voice saying \"aaah\" make this beat really catchy and aesthetically pleasing.   3) Tranquility - Isaiah Rashad (Cilvia Demo, 2014)   The title of this song matches the beat perfectly. I would have never thought that just three instruments (a bass guitar, piano, and muffed drums) could make such a beautiful beat, and not only is it peaceful and soothing to listen to, it's really catchy. This song is truly unique. This is another example of great stuff coming from TDE.   4) Forbidden Fruit - J. Cole (Born Sinner, 2013)    This is one of the smoothest and most mischievous beats i've heard in a long time. The snazzy and modern drum riff combined with the finger picked guitar and omnipresent bass guitar riff make this beat truly \"fire\".   5) 67 Turbo Jet - Curren$y (Cigarette Boats EP, 2012?)   Talk about smooth. Harry Fraud is a real genius when it comes to sampling, and this song samples Children of the Ghetto by Philip Bailey. This beat is the kind of stuff you see at the end of a movie when the slick hero and his girl are riding off into the sunset with a serene ending. Truly soft and smooth beat.   6) Flava in Ya Ear -  Craig Mack (Project Funk Da World, 1994)   Okay, I couldn't help myself. It's just that the golden age of hip hop was called that for a reason (one of those being because of all the amazing instrumentals it produced). This beat literally has three elements, drums, a two note guitar riff, and a sizzling siren type sound during the chorus, and boy is it fun to listen to. It's extremely catchy, and embodies the funky charisma of that age of rap. It also goes to show how simple can go a lot farther than complex in some contexts.   7) Shook Ones pt. II - Mobb Deep (The Infamous, 1995)   Oh man, I don't even know where to start. This beat is just fire. It has been sampled by many songs and just has a real deep and impactful vibe to it, but not an overwhelming one and one that you can still relate to. It has a classic 90's drum line and the guitar in the back is what really makes it.   8) The Recipe - Kendrick Lamar (good kid, m.A.A.d city, 2013)   This is probably my favorite beat from GKMC. The sample of the girl's voice, which comes from Mr. Twin Sister by Meet the Frownies is what glues the song together for me. That, combined, with the programmed drums, Asian sounding pick-guitar and relishing electronic sounds in the back make this beat really amazing.  9) Jazz - Mick Jenkins (The Water[s], 2014)   First off, Mick Jenkins is a severely underlistened and underrated rapper. This song is one testament to that statement. How many other rappers do you know who sample xylophone type sounds and pull it off so beautifully? That combined with the really catchy drum and snap riff and maraca type shaking sound make this beat really fresh.   And lastly. . . (but definitely not least)  10) Exhibit C- Jay Electronica ( Victory, 2010 )   Not only does this song have some of the hardest bars i've ever heard, but the instrumental by Just Blaze is something else. The piano, drums, and basslines work in sync beautifully, and to top it off, Jay's voice and his sample of Billy Stewart's Cross My Heart make this song's beat truly memorable. I hope you enjoyed, and this list is just a drop in the ocean. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Ontome\" by Knxwledge- The sample flip for the first minute of the song is a thing of beauty.  Knxlwedge showcases his skills while using the qualities of the original song that made it great.  I also love how he will completely change up a song midway through, as he does here.  I highly recommend that you purchase the album \"Ontome\" is off of, Kauliflowr.   \"One Day\" and \"Work\" by RJD2-The way RJ incorporates the extended vocal samples in both of these songs blows my mind.  He does some really incredible stuff with samples and I find both Deadringer and Since We Last Spoke have high reply value.  \"Hold Me Down\"- Apollo BrownIf you are looking for mellow instrumental album that gets better with each listen, pick up a copy of Skilled Trade.  Using nothing more than some records, Cool Edit 2.0, and a desktop computer from 2000, Brown created one of my favorite beat tape/instrumental albums of all-time.  \"Hold Me Down\" is a personal favorite, though I love all of the songs.    \"Flattery\"- Prince Paul featuring SteinskiThis one comes from Paul's criminally slept on Itstrumental album and features funny vocals from sample legend Steinski.  The fact that this album has three reviews on Amazon is depressing.  Unforgettable sample triggers for the hook make this an instant classic.  \"Midnight in a Perfect World\"- DJ ShadowThough I heard this song close to the time of its release in the mid 90s, it wasn't until many years later that I began to understand the beauty and complexity of Shadow's composition.  If you want some additional insight into his deep respect for music and vinyl, check out this music video and the documentary Scratch.  \"Single\"- 14KT14KT, like Apollo Brown, also hails from Detroit and also made a catalog of great music with Cool Edit 2.0.  Some of his favorite Cool Edit beats were released as an album titled Nowalataz.  KT made this song during that period, but it did not make the final cut.    \"Two Can Win\"- J DillaMy favorite track off of Dilla's legendary Donuts album.  This album and song are very important to me on a personal level because I listened to them constantly while going through a rough transitional phase.  I still get chills every time the 0:15-0:33 section plays.    \"The Gates\"- CunninlynguistsI'm a big Cunninlynguists and Kno fan.  This is my favorite song/beat of theirs, off of the A Piece of Strange album.  The first time I heard this track it nearly brought a tear to my eye.  It is so somber and beautiful.  \"Sun Rays\"-Dibia$eA crazy, bugged-out mangling of Ramp's classic \"Everybody Loves the Sunshine\".  Dibia$e is a really inspiring person and musician.  Check him out on YouTube and make sure to pick up some of his music.  Swingology 101 is excellent.  ",

            "answer_text": "Comes down to taste, dude. Some of the best-produced instrumentals ever (that is sound, arrangement, how individual elements within a beat are used..) are -Any timbaland beat starting in 2003 and beyond -Any Neptunes beat ever. Pharrell isn't doing as well without Chad Hugo behind the boards but he's got so much money he can hire any engineer in the world (see G.I.R.L) -Recent Just Blaze tracks \"lord knows\" \"compton\" \"exhibit C\" although not a fan of the mixing. -Anything Rick Rubin did for the Beastie Boys. -Dre 2001 every track. -Really, Timbo, The Neptunes, late Kanye, late Just Blaze, Black Milk after his first album... Check out BadBadNotGood. -And believe it or not, Lex Luger takes a lot of pride in his sound.  The above are sound-based guys with some incredible beats. Alchemist is my favorite producer but his stuff is more based in the raw artistry of beatmaking than technical engineering.. The sampling is incredible.. He's got the best ear period. Sick beats.  The most incredible sampler is Madlib. The guy is a freak. Dilla's beats are just not my taste. My fav dudes (check em out): Alc, Oh No, Nicolay, 9th Wonder, Just Blaze, Black Milk, Madlib, KANYE when he was doing soul and beats for others. NO ID. Premier, Statik. Look out for Jake One too. Statik Selektah killing it lately. Sick beats and sound. I can give you a list of what some of the best instrumentals are but it's completely subjective thus not a question with an answer, in my mind at least. Speaking of the subjectivity, Aaron, the Mad Men beat? By RJD2? Really? Come on.. Check out Astronote's \"Liquid I\" or \"Wings Damu the Fudgemunk Remix\" by Union ",

            "answer_text": "While there are many others to choose from that are just as dope, I have to suggest Talib Kweli & Hi Tek - Love Speakeasy off of Talib Kweli's Reflection Eternal album. Cincinnati's own, DJ Hi Tek was the mastermind behind this one. I like it for several reasons:  Nostalgia - anything with horns reminds me of Pete Rock and CL Smooth's \"Reminisce\" track - my favorite track of all timeBreak in the music - The instra track from the latest Macklemore album was listed here. I think it's dope when emcees can let the producer have some shine on an album. Kweli let Hi Tek shine here Reminds me of the old days when Gangstarr were a forceSoulful - If this beat doesn't make you want to ride with the top (or windows) down while on your favorite highway with the music blasting, you should probably check yourself for a pulse.",

Also anything by DJ Premier, in my opinion the greatest beat maker of all time. Throw in J Dilla, 9th Wonder, Kanye for more sampled jams. Then you have to mention beasts from the 90s: Timbaland, Mannie Fresh, Just Blaze, Swizz Beats. I actually like a bunch of new producers who have unique styles: Lex Luger, Boi 1Da, T Minus, Jahlil Beats, Metro Boomin. I could go on for days.... flip through above instrumentals and you will find something beautiful. ",
