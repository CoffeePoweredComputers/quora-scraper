            "answer_text": "Did all cowboys do all things at all times? No. Cowboys were/are still human beings. There are times off-job when they have to entertain themselves. Some went into town for entertainment and \u2026 got involved in the entertainment. Especially with a few extra shots of whiskey. There is also a very lonely job: https://www.blybooks.com/2014/03/old-west-jobs/ Those who spend a lot of time looking for strays also need social times. Activities with others. For accountability and for support. To prevent loss of reality because of too much seclusion. I want you to pay close attention to the last sentence. What exactly does that mean? To be alone, how do you prevent loss of reality? Many did it by writing poetry, singing songs, etc. It\u2019s primarily a distraction because you are entirely alone in the middle of nowhere. You don\u2019t have to worry about criticism, there is no one to hear you 99.99% of the time. My grandfather was a modern Lineman and I was training to be a lineman when his friends sold the ranch. So yes, cowboys talk to themselves, write poetry, read books, sing songs, and many other personal and individual human things. Each one is different because person was different. Each found what worked for them. Although Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West Show was primarily Western sharpshooters, there were other performances including dancers and singers and musicians from the west. Most of these had some western twist. Stars of the Wild West Show  Bee Ho Gray took his musical act with a singing coyote on to Vaudeville after the Wild West Show went bankrupt. Others survived, most didn\u2019t if their catch wasn\u2019t unique enough. Cowboys are just people. Some do this. Some to that. Some sang songs in the past. Some sings songs today. Most don\u2019t. Stop with the \u201creal cowboys\u201d remarks, it\u2019s uncalled for. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and they still do. Movie cowboys like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry sang and if you watch Roy's movies you'll not only see and hear him sing but he also can take on the rustlers and bank robbers et al. Gene Autry worked on his father's ranch when he was a kid . A good amount of the popular country and western singers grew up on a ranch or worked on a ranch or a farm at some point in their life. This is not surprising as a large ranch or farm would have been a great source of employment for these young musicians. Minding livestock or feeding farm animals is a good way to learn the value of getting up early in the morning and caring for what you are growing or raising. Some of the popular country artists in history grew up in more urban areas of the US but still sang about the wide range, the desert, the linemen, bandits and cowgirls who broke their hearts and such. It's often that you will find country singers who have worked in a ranch or a farm or a factory than actual cow wrangling or on a horse ranch or a similar occupation. The cowboy way has been celebrated in recorded country music for 60 years plus and will continue - you'll just hear new singers and new sub genres keep forming as time goes on. ",

            "answer_text": "Before there was the Country Western music as we know it today, there was simply Country. And Western. They didn\u2019t merge until the early part of the 20th Century. The Western songs came from cowboys and the lifestyle that surrounded them. The why can usually broken down into two parts: boredom - because at times, ranching can be very lonely. And sometimes it was done out of necessity. Back in the early days of raising cattle, the earlier breeds were more skittish than they are now. In fact they could get very nervous and bolt over very little - like the sound of a distant predator. Cowboys found one of the easiest ways to keep them calm was to sing to them. Nothing fancy, just something long, low and melodious. A good singing voice to a cowboy was a valuable a tool as a good saddle or a lariat. A lot of songs doubtlessly came out that way. ",
