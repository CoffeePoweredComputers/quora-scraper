            "answer_text": "If you make music you can distribute music to various streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music etc you have to sign in with a record label or there is a easy way too use music distribution service. They are easy to use and you can publish your own music by that. Just go to any music distribution website I\u2019ll suggest you to use Routenote because it is free to use but if you will only get 80% of the royalties and if you use pAid service so go with ditto music or ditto kid like websites you will get 100% of the royalties and they take 20$ yearly as their plan ",
