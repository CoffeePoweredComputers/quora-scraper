            "answer_text": "There are three main archetypes of commanders: The bureacrat is a master of the traditional and less dramatic aspects of war; he plays it safe, wages attritional campaigns, and buries you in logistics. An RL example of that would be Bernard Montgomery in WW2. The scientist is very innovative and wages war in ways that are both revolutionary but also very mechanical. RL examples of that would be Ulysses Grant and Georgi Zhukov. Then there is the hero, who is the risk taker and the artist, operating more on instinct than knowledge, they can intuit those fleeting moments that can turn the tides of battles and campaigns. RL examples of that include Hannibal and Rommel. Each archetype has strengths and weaknesses. The hero can be nigh-invincible in any single battle regardless of the odds, but their success can lead to more and more risks that inevitably end in disaster. The scientist can carry the campaign with better planning, a weakness of the hero, but is not as adaptable to either danger or opportunity. The bureacrat's use of old fashioned ways of war means that they can lose lots of battles but still win the war by preventing the enemy from exploiting those victories. However their caution makes them even less adaptable to danger or opportunity than the scientist. Revan and Thrawn are different archetypes. Thrawn is a hero: extremely unorthodox, very good at improvisation, very adaptable, and nigh-unbeatable in a straight up fight. However Thrawn is also a one-man show who does all of his own planning without input from anyone else, and is also prone to micromanaging his subordinates. Furthermore, although he was very good at analysis, he was also sometimes a little too clever for his own good, occasionally prone to making deductions that were logical but still wrong, and also didn't do much in the way of contingency planning. (He didn't have any plan at all for the Noghri betraying him or for the destruction of the cloning facility). Revan is a scientist. He defeated the Mandalorians by becoming just as merciless and ruthless as they were; many of his victories were achieved by sacrificing resources and territory to gain an advantage. You see Revan's command style in one of the questions that the Rakata computer asks: deciphering enemy codes leads to two revelations: a spot in their defenses will be at it's weakest in ten days and they will attack one of your cities in five days; the \u201ccorrect response\u201d, i.e. what Revan would do, is to prepare to attack the weakness and let the enemy attack the city so that they don't know you have broken their codes. So, barring the use of Battle Meditation, any war between Thrawn and Revan would be putting Thrawn's greater adaptablity at the tactical level against Revan's greater ruthlessness at the strategic level. Which one would win would depend largely on the forces and territory each has at their disposal. Of course when you factor in Battle Meditation allowing Revan to compensate for the main weakness of the scientist vs. the hero, Revan would definitely come out on top. ",
