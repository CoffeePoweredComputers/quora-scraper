            "answer_text": "As soon any Viber user deleted/disable his/her Viber account, availability to call/message via Viber for that user just got removed. If you communicate someone with Viber previously but user currently have disabled/delete Viber account, Viber apps on your side just stop showing his/her contact details on \u2018Viber Only\u2019 tab of contact list. Though it could be listed on \u201cALL\u201d tab with some option to \u2018invite\u2019 user to use Viber Service. In nutshell, user with viber account will have viber icon attach on contact details on your Viber Apps contact list. If user have no active account with Viber there should be some kind of \u2018Invite\u2019 option instead of \u2018Viber Icon\u2019 on contact details of individual in concern. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the name will be visible to you as a Viber contact.  The contact list on Viber is fetched from your phone contacts. Consider two Viber users A and B. A has B\u2019s phone number: B is visible to A. B has A\u2019s phone number: A is visible to B. A removes B\u2019s phone number from his phone (B does nothing): B is not visible to A, but A is visible to B. (as asked in question). A uninstalls Viber app without deactivating account: Still A is visible to B - with last seen of the date when A uninstalled app. A blocks B or A deactivates Viber account: A is not visible to B even if B has A\u2019s phone number saved to contact list. Hope this helps! ",
