            "answer_text": "To be honest, not very similar. Yes, it has the same tuning, and a bass guitar player can get something out of it fairly quickly. They might even think they\u2019re doing OK at it. But consider: I need a 250W 1x15 amp to play almost as loud with bass guitar as I can on a double bass with no amp at all. There are a LOT of physical tricks to making that possible, you don\u2019t learn them quickly, and you won\u2019t be fit to do them for more than a couple of minutes without long practice. You have to pull those strings HARD, and it\u2019s kind of a Kung-Fu trick; the power comes from your back and shoulders, not really your hands. There is so much more, and most of it only comes when you start using a bow. Bowing, alone, is as hard to learn as bass guitar. I am not exaggerating here. Also, the physical challenge is enough that, if you do it wrong, you will badly damage your hands in ways that take many years to heal. (There is no other activity I can think of that can require doing 10kg pulls with your little finger at eight reps per second for 4 or 5 minutes on end\u2026 double bass can require that). Don\u2019t try to teach yourself, find a competent teacher, if only to save your hands. Going the other direction, double bass to bass guitar\u2026 not all that hard. But you still need to learn how to deal with the music styles, and that\u2019s just as difficult on either instrument. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other answers here. I can add this information to the thread. The fingering is different on the upright because you don\u2019t use your ring finger on the left hand due to the extra reach on the longer fret board. One accomplished upright player suggested using a think rubber band to join my pinky and ring finger together as a training aid. You can find out more about this on YouTube. You also make more use of open strings on an upright as opposed to the electric bass which uses mostly closed positions. You can stick dots on the side of the fingerboard to help you play in tune. I started out with a lot of dots. I gradually weened myself down to just a few. I probably wouldn't need them at all if I practiced the upright more often. So many instruments, so little time. :-) ",
