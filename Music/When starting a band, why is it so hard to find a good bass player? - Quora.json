            "answer_text": "As everyone else has mentioned, most people initially prefer to play guitar. That\u2019s largely because there are many more \u201csuperstar\u201d guitarists than bassists. Sure there are excellent very well known bassists, but how many of those bassists (especially one\u2019s who didn\u2019t start out as guitarists) are the actual leader of their band? Thinking about it, even Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Jack Bruce of Cream, both having a strong leadership role, were still not the exclusive leaders of their bands. The only one I can think of is Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzie. Still, how does he rank compared to Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, or Stevie Ray Vaugh? Certainly a \u201cstar\u201d, but not really a \u201csuperstar\u201d of that high of a magnitude. A mere bass player. Ho-hum. Not a \u201cGuitar God\u201d. It\u2019s perception. Sure you can put up ads, and audition dozens of bass players, ranging from awful to mediocre\u2026 And you may get really, really lucky and find a truly great bassist\u2026 But it\u2019s like playing the lottery. Better odds of getting hit by lightning. My advice\u2026 Go hang around music stores. A lot. There, you can audition bassists without them even realizing it! No having to say \u201cUm\u2026 sorry, you\u2019re not exactly the bassist we\u2019re looking for\u2026\u201d \u2026After the poor guy took the effort to carry his heavy bass rig down the narrow stairs into your practice space\u2026 No having to see the totally disappointed look on their hopeful face and feeling guilted into letting them join your band\u2026 Only to have to toss them out on their ear later , when they just can\u2019t seem to learn the intricate and difficultly timed parts of your songs. None of that \u201cdrama\u201d\u2026 Just \u201cHey that guy in the corner trying out amps can really play excellently!\u201d Let\u2019s ask him! - Even if they\u2019re already solidly in a band, and decline to \u201caudition your band\u201d, here\u2019s a lesser known tip\u2026 Most really good bassists also know or at least know of other really good bassists who are currently looking for a band! Alternately, even if they don\u2019t, maybe ask them to teach you how to play bass like a actual bassist. Like they do. Most bassists are generally pretty easy going and friendly. And willing to help out other bassists and musicians. Willing to show some great techniques. Playing bass requires most of the same knowledge of the neck\u2026 And music theory, timing, etc. as for guitar. And often more music theory. Sure guitarists know plenty of scales, but ask one to play the \u201cthird\u201d note of a key, or the \u201cfifth\u201d, and nine out of ten will just blink at you with glassy eyes. Hum it and they\u2019re there. (Once they\u2019ve poked around to find it.) Where bassists mostly differ, is usually in their willingness to take the back seat, out of the limelight. A good guitarist who is willing to give up \u201chot-dogging\u201d in order to support their band can become a better bassist than some guy who only took bass up \u201cbecause it had only four strings and looked easier\u201d. Horrible bass players started out with that thinking. Which is why they suck, and always will. The fact is, it\u2019s not easier\u2026 \u2026At least if you\u2019re really doing a really great job at it. Can\u2019t find a great bassist? Become a great bassist. Then you\u2019ll be the one in demand if your band ever splits up. And, even if you later decide that bass playing isn\u2019t for you, you\u2019ll have a unique perspective of what a great bassist really does, and how music actually fits together to be great. It worked out splendidly for Jimmy Page. It can work out great for you too. My story\u2026 A friend and I decided to learn guitar together. Once we both got to a certain point, we decided to form a band. Well someone had to play bass. He got a cheap bass and played bass for a short while. But, he had another friend who was a great guitarist, that started teaching him all the amazing things we couldn\u2019t ever figure out on our own. Then my buddy bought himself a brand new Gibson SG. Meanwhile I was still \u201cplinking\u201d on a really horrible Sears and Roebuck piece of garbage. So I was effectively forced into playing bass, and just a little bit disgruntled at the time. But he was (and still is) a great friend, so I got over it pretty quickly. Fortunately, I realized it wasn\u2019t about me, it was about \u201cthe band\u201d. Once I started to figure out and master basslines by Jack Bruce, John Paul Jones, Jack Casady and lots of other great bassists, I realized he actually did me a huge, huge favor. Playing bass was both challenging and fun. And there is nothing like the feeling you get playing bass, standing next to the bass amp, cranked way up! It\u2019s an indescribable feeling of power. Those low bass notes rattle your bones, not just your ears. It\u2019s really the bass that drives the power of music, not so much the guitar as I had once thought. While I never got to be the great lead guitarist he became, I became an excellent bassist, and in many ways a much, much better guitarist for it. It gave me the opportunity to learn and really understand all the different parts required to make music great and just how they all fit together. What the role of the bassist really is. And trust me, it\u2019s not just holding down \u201cThe Groove\u201d. Sure that is really important, but bass can be very melodic too. And, there are things you can play that make the guitar actually sound more complex than it really is. For instance if you play a descending line and take it down an interval each go-around while the guitar just repeats the initial descending phrase, it\u2019s magical. And there you are, playing\u2026 Grinning like a little kid inside, because you\u2019re the only one who knows that secret. Too cool! Try it\u2026 Play bass. You have nothing whatsoever to lose, and a lot to gain. (EDIT) Here\u2019s tablature for an easy standard Bass lick to get you going:  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHey mom, can I take bass lessons?\u201d said nobody ever. Or hardly ever. Guitar? Check. Drums? Check. Keyboards? Yup. Bass? \u201cYou wanna be a bass player?\u201d Odds are your bass player is going to be a converted guitarist. Why? Because bands are expected to have bass players. Somebody\u2019s gotta do it. And most mediocre guitar players can usually (and quickly) be turned into reasonably mediocre bass players. The bass, after all, isn\u2019t much more than the third, fourth, fifth and sixth strings of the guitar - tuned one octave down with its notes played on a nearly identical fret board. All of those notes can be found roughly in the same place they are on the guitar. As a result, becoming an adequate bass player isn\u2019t all that tough. Becoming a good bass player is another story. It takes work. And, to be honest, it ain\u2019t all that much fun. A good bass player understands the instrument\u2019s role. And the theory behind playing the thing. The bass drives the beat. It creates counterpoint. And, of course, it fills in the bottom end. A good bass player develops an ear for the instrument that goes beyond those tired three chord step runs. A good bass player intuitively knows what notes go, or can go, where \u2026 and why. And how a little creativity can take a song in an entirely different and distinctive direction. The good ones, the truly good ones, are a rarity. They\u2019re people who\u2019ve committed to the instrument as an instrument - rather than a flirtation or a temporary sideline brought about by necessity. And they work at it. With little or no expectation of recognition for the contribution they and that instrument are making to the sound. The bass is music\u2019s witness protection program. Nobody notices you\u2019re there - until you\u2019re not. Advice: Get good. No bass player? Rent one from the Internet by investing a few bucks for a custom bass backing track that can be used to record a demo. Post it to a site like Bandmix. State what you\u2019re looking for in a bass player. If your demo tracks are good, the bass players - the real bass players - will seek you out. ",

            "answer_text": "This may have already been stated in the other answers but I make it a point never to look at the other answers before I leave an answer. So I apologize in advance for any possible redundancies that I may be guilty of. My answer to your question is more of an observation about guitar players. Many guitar players, and I mean a whole lot of them, think that just because they can fret a note on a bass guitar that that means they can play the bass, and technically that\u2019s true, but that by no means makes that guitar player a bassist. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Not that being a guitar player and a bassist are mutually exclusive of each other. There are many examples of it, for instance, Paul Macartney and Stephen Stills come to mind as does Mike Rutheford. But playing the bass is a whole different headspace than playing the guitar and most guitar players really don\u2019t share that headspace. And if it doesn\u2019t come naturally you really have to make a concerted effort to get yourself there. Something that few guitar players are able to pull off. Or maybe just unwilling, but it all boils down to the same thing. I am a guitar player who plays the bass on all the songs I write and record but by no means do I consider myself a bassist. The same goes for Drums and keyboards. I take on those roles by default as I am alone when I write and record music. I have included here a song I wrote in which I attempted to get that 60s Motown vibe that I really love. I don\u2019t know that I succeeded but my point is that I really had to disconnect myself from my guitar player side to find an appropriate bass part, which in turn helped me find an appropriate drum part. It goes without saying that I am no James Jamerson, but then again, who really is. James is up there amongst the all time greats for good reason. So I guess to answer your question I would just have to say it\u2019s because a good bass player is a rare animal to find. So if you are lucky enough to come across one, don\u2019t be a dick to him or her. Because in reality, it is the presence of bass that actually makes the sound of the guitar sound so good and should be greatly appreciated and held up high. The Note ",

            "answer_text": "Bass is hard because of the multiple tasks of rhythm, root and counterpoint. In the Baroque Era, music was often written for lead and \u201ccontinuo\u201d. The continuo could be notated by a bass note or chord, and was interpreted by variable ensemble, most often some combination of a theorbos, harpsichord and bass viols. We have reduced this three to five person section to a single bass, aided by the replacement of a percussion section by a trap set. The Viol player had to be well versed in the forms, styles, scales and conventions of the era - and when I say scales, they had to move the frets for the differing scales of Italy, France, Germany and England, none of which were equal divisions. Southern music tended to favor thirds and Northern music fifths, but there were also regional variants. It is not so different today - Blues, Jazz and Wold music use bent notes and have historical patterns in modes, rhythm and accent feel so deep they take years to learn and are best as native languages, heard from birth. The stylistic patterns have to be so deeply entrained they are instinctive, because all performances should be a jam offering something fresh and relevant to the moment. The bassist also has to understand everything else that is going on. The relationship of bass to vocals is critical. Listen to John McVie, John S. Denman, Tony Levin, Pino Palladino, Paul McCartney, Carole Kaye, Chuck Rainey, Nathan East, or the original, Ray Brown. He was so good he married Ella! Duck Dunn at Stax, James Jamerson and Bob Babbitt at Motown - the bass makes it happen. The bass sets the beat, and expresses it ahead or behind a precise amount. This timing is way below millisecond divisions into microseconds, and the more remarkable because bass instruments (especially bass SPEAKERS) have millisecond delays dependent on the note. The bassist has to hold the key and tie the harmonic progression together vertically and horizontally with leading tones, foreshadowing and echoes - and come back to the root one every time depending on the genre. The proper bass attitude is like the musical mother of the band, making sure everybody sticks together and gets what they need. For all of this the bass is often considered a detail because much of the best bass is invisible, especially in blues and rock like Tommy Shannon, Harvey Brooks, Bill Wyman or Dee Anthony. Bass is only allowed to step out in instrumental music and even then it usually can\u2019t \u201cget busy\u201d, it\u2019s more \u201cdown to business\u201d on the low end. With all these skills, practice, history, and psyche including the ability to carry on repetitive figures with little recognition, it is not surprising that good ones are rare. ",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re a rare sort. Here I speak of actual bassists, not guitarists who sit in on bass occasionally. Most people want to be out front. In rock, that means lead guitar and vocals. The bass\u2014in most, but not all, bands\u2014plays a supporting role. We make the rest of you sound better. We lock in with the drums to create the rhythm that moves the audience. We anchor the harmony so you can take your leads with confidence. We step out once in a while, too. But it\u2019s not the main thing, for us. So, to be a good bassist, you need a good sense of time, a good sense of harmony, and a self-effacing, supportive disposition. These are exceedingly rare qualities. Someone has already said that some bassists are guys who wanted to be guitarists but couldn\u2019t manage it\u2014an old saw that I tire of hearing, though there\u2019s some truth to it. Here\u2019s an observation in the opposite direction, from the point-of-view of a bassist. It\u2019s been my experience that good bassists are often the smart guys in the band. As such, they can find something else to do with their time. They\u2019re likely to have many interests. They\u2019re likely to be gainfully employed. Can you say the same for most guitarists you\u2019ve met? I can\u2019t. Guitar is the most popular instrument in the world. Bass probably isn\u2019t in the top 50. It\u2019s a tuba, basically. It\u2019s a really sexy tuba. I love it. I think it\u2019s the coolest instrument in the history of instruments. But most people don\u2019t share my love of it. They\u2019d rather be singers, or guitarists, or drummers. We\u2019re the few and the proud. We\u2019re an odd brotherhood of under-appreciated craftsmen who make things click, even though most people never realize it. ",

            "answer_text": "As several others have said, bass isn't a glamorous instrument. Most young, aspiring musicians want to be in the spotlight; they want to step up and lay down that killer guitar solo in front of hundreds/thousands of screaming, adoring fans. That's something that most bass players don't get to do. Fact is, most of them don't want to \u2014 which should tell you right there that bass players usually have a different mindset. The best ones are all about the music; they understand how essential the bass is to the music. That understanding, however, leads many bassists to an overinflated sense of their own value and makes them impossible to work with. In my experience, the hard part isn't finding a bass player, it's finding a really GOOD bass player who digs the genre I've chosen for my project, who isn't already committed to a project (or is overcommitted to several other projects), and who isn't a flake, narcissist, megalomaniac, primal donna, addict/alcoholic, or drama queen. I have ONE rule in my bands- NO DRAMA - and most of the talented bassists in my area seem to be unable to live with that. The biggest reason, it seems to me, that finding a good bassist is so hard, comes down to geography. Chances are, you wouldn't have a problem if you were in LA, Seattle, Chicago, Miami, or NYC. If you're in a major metropolitan area and you still can't find a bass player, you might need to look inward. ",

Instead, you\u2019ll be choosing from among the league of mediocre guitar players who will concede and play bass just to get in a band. As a former punk rock vocalist who\u2019s way too old to be a frontman, I am considering taking up the bass, which is the only rock & roll instrument I\u2019ve ever had any interest in learning. I want to start with it too, and not come around to it from the guitar. I have always sung (and written) lyrics based on what the rhythm section was doing, to some degree ignoring the guitar parts as other free-standing outfront instrumentals, paying just enough attention to stay in key (or out, depending). The bass is what you move too, and is often providing a melody that you don\u2019t recognize unless it\u2019s isolated or removed. The latter is what I find so difficult to enjoy in all of the two-piece bands that have proliferated in recent years; especially under the umbrella of Metal. It is almost always a guitarist & drummer, one or both doing vocals if there are any. Not only are they generally quite boring to look at playing live, I have yet to hear one that I don\u2019t find lacking sonically as well. No amount of down-tuning and/or effects pedals on a guitar can make up for the visceral waves and pulses that a bass line can inject into any musical genre, and it most certainly can\u2019t replace the thunderous, martial, staccato punch that is fundamentally required for Metal. A double-kick bass drum comes close, but no cigar. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve looked at your profile, but it\u2019s blank, so I\u2019m firing off some ideas off the top of my head. Factors affecting this might be: Where you liveYour ageThe kind of music you playYour attitude!Playing of any instrument is helped by lessons from local teachers and role modelling of good players in local bands. Perhaps there is not enough of a bass community in your area. Bass is not so hard to play, but if you\u2019re young you might overlook it in favour of guitar because it seems more glamorous. Many pro bass players have taken up the instrument because there were enough guitarists in the band already! They usually realise how enjoyable playing bass is, as well as how much more marketable than guitar, and have no regrets. Genre can make a lot of difference. Various metal sub-genres can be ferociously demanding, in terms of both stamina and tricky time signatures. Ditto with things like fusion. What kind of music do you play? Is it a case of not being able to find someone who has both the skill level required and a desire to play that kind of music? I have to raise the question of what kind of band leader you are - if you are - as bands work well when there is either clear leadership from someone with a vision, or a genuine collective spirit. In both cases clear communication is required and a positive, supportive attitude. Better to have a bassist who is a good fit in personal terms and who could develop the skill level. What are your requirements of your bass player? If you\u2019re young and just starting out, I don\u2019t believe it has to be an issue of gear. There are lots of budget basses around that are perfectly good for basic gigging, ditto with backline. Some pro bassists go straight into the PA through something like a Sansamp Bass Driver DI, so they might not even need an amp. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmmm. You know I\u2019ve wondered this too. I was in a band in high school and bass was the last position we got ironed out. And it took like, months. One reason could be that bassists often play other instruments. I know several bass players who are in reality, multi-instrumentalists, but make bass their main instrument because it\u2019s the only rock instrument that doesn\u2019t really need to stand out, and if you can play many instruments, maybe you haven\u2019t focused hugely on just one. Additionally, these bassists might already be in a band as either the bassist, keyboardist, horn player, guitarist, singer, you name it. Since, as you mentioned, good bassists are at a premium, they tend to get snatched up quick, leaving only the beginners or scrubs. Another reason is good bass players tend to take music, and musical projects that they enter into, really seriously, so they\u2019re very selective. My former band\u2019s bassist only likes to play with a handful of people. A band a few of my friends had broke up because-you guessed it- the bassist left, unsatisfied. Thirdly, most bassists I know are very introverted. They might just be shy about their skills or playing with/for people they don\u2019t know. I feel like guitarists, drummers, and singers are more likely to flaunt themselves. They\u2019re out there! ",

            "answer_text": "The obvious reason is that there are fewer bass players than players of other instruments, but I suppose you are asking why? In short, outside of jazz, bass is often an afterthought in music. I\u2019ve heard people claim that certain songs don\u2019t even have a bass part in it, where to me it\u2019s clear as day. Many bass parts in contemporary popular and rock music are quite simple to play, and sometimes low in the mix- it\u2019s not that part of the music that people sit up and pay attention to. The parts that people do hear easily and pay attention to are the singer and lead guitar player, which is why it\u2019s quite easy to find singers and guitar players (or even singing guitar players). It would be fairly easy for most rock fans to name a dozen or more popular guitar players in rock history (JimmyPageKeithRichardsJoeSatrianiEddieVanHalenTedNugentPeteTownshendSlashJimiHendrixPeterFramptonJeffBuckleyBobDylanNealSchon \u2026 <breath>), but can anyone do the same for bass players? Maybe I could, because I enjoy nerding out like that, but most casual music fans probably don\u2019t even know who James Jamerson or Jaco Pastorious are. So you\u2019re looking for someone who deliberately picked up an instrument that most people don\u2019t care that much about and are adept at it. Generally, those that are decent have found a project already. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of so-called musicians out there, including bass players, but the bass player is so fundamental to both the rhythmic and harmonic integrity of pretty much any type of band, that mediocre simply doesn\u2019t cut it. Fundamental is related to the same root as foundation. You can build a crappy house on a good foundation and it will not fall down, but you can\u2019t do the reverse. If your bass player isn\u2019t performing his function adequately you will know it because the overall sound of your band will suck. Even decent musicians will not sound good with a bad bass player. No one wants anything except a good bass player, whereas you can put up with a mediocre guitar player (and all too often he\u2019s the band leader anyway.) The other thing about bass players is that they play a line based on the roots of the chord charts and so they can play with lots of different bands. Because of that, good bass players are in high demand. They can pick and choose who they want to play with. My bass player, for example, hates playing with blues combos because it bores him to tears. So make sure that your band is fully committed, isn\u2019t full of prima donnas and jerks, is organized and easy to work with, and offers some fun and interesting music to your prospective good bass player, or she\u2019ll find someone better than you to gig with.

            "answer_text": "I have found many bass players are just guitarists with a bass. This often changes the function and sound of the bass(Chris Squire from Yes and very few others are exceptions to this rule). I have also found that so many people pick up the bass because it\u2019s \u201ceasier to learn than guitar. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In spite of the fact that bassists do not usually play full chords like a 6 string player they must know the make up of each chord in order to create effective bass lines. Playing the root note on every song is usually not effective playing for an entire set at a gig. Of course it\u2019s needed sometimes, but a bass player can bring excitement to a group by changing the note they play(for example, if the guitar is playing an F triad and I play an A or C it gives the chord a new feel) The other thing that makes GOOD bass players hard to find is the fact that many young players try to play the instrument like one long solo. Yes, we can be busy, but if a bassist doesn\u2019t establish the groove a song dies. My idol John Entwistle was a very busy player, but he always played what the song called for. Listen to his playing with Moon and compare it to his playing with Kenny Jones. Very different, but equally effective. I love being a bass player!!! I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Supply and demand. There aren\u2019t very many good bass players. Once you get known as a good bass player, you very quickly have offers of more work than you can actually do. So you get picky about what you take. What would you do, if you get an offer from two really good bands and one not quite so good, and you only have enough time to play for two? Yep, the not quite so good band has no bass player. Secondly, one of the reasons there seem to be fewer good bass players than there actually are is simple: have you looked at the prices of good bass gear? Yeah, your guitarist probably has equipment much further up the quality ladder than your bass player, unless somehow your bass player spent four times as much money. And there\u2019s a bigger difference between a cheap crappy bass amp and a good one than there is with guitar gear. Double bass is even worse. You can buy a decent playable electric guitar and an amp for the price of a set of good double bass strings. Not kidding, last set I bought was $650\u2026 fortunately, they last for years. ",

But to look at it from different perspective, it is hard to find a bass player that fits the band. Just like a marriage, finding a right member could make or break the band. Of course, good and well seasoned bass player will definitely bring something new to the table, possibly elevate the band even more. But there is that one guy somewhere, that really belongs to a band. One time I got asked to join my friend\u2019s band practice session. We played and we played, but it\u2019s just didn\u2019t feel right, we did not gel very well. Something was off and awkward. Then I listen to some of the song with their previous bass player. I surprised and really enjoy his basslines and that fits the song perfectly. While when I get together with my church pals and try to practice and arrange a song, boom. We got couple hours and we have bunch of finished song. It is about finding people with the same wavelength as yours. And if you do, don\u2019t let them go. ",

T\u2019was a good group\u2014but it flamed out under some really weird circumstances. I reckon I\u2019ve played darned near every genre, from jazz to pop. Southern rock. Funk. Punk. Reggae. Top Forty. Old standards. I read and I can manuscript, so learning new tunes was never a problem for me. At jam sessions, I\u2019d get compliments, but the best compliment is employment. I always had good gear, transportation, and a willingness to work with a-holes. I can work with Attila the Hun if he plays his parts right. In fact, I think I did for about six months but he was a heavy substance abuser like a lot of barbarian lead players. About a decade ago, I changed a few things and made my employability even less possible. (See picture) If it hadn\u2019t been for my godson\u2014offspring of the drummer and lead singer/guitarist in my first working pro band\u2014I\u2019d probably never play with anyone again. But we had a nice little band called Puppetshow (any Spinal Tap fans out there?) that played a mashup of copy and originals. We had fun, but I\u2019ve pretty much quit playing professionally. I fiddle with recording, mess about on guitar, but don\u2019t play bass much, even though I still have my Rick and a compact little Ampeg (BA115) that kicks ass for anything but a big stage. Instead, I\u2019m a writing instructor in a city that seems pretty liberal, but hasn\u2019t responded much to my musical overtures. Such is life.  ",

            "answer_text": "My son is a professional bassist with a degree in jazz performance from a very good Conservatorium. The answer to your question has multiple facets - People like him are very rare. He has never wanted to be a guitarist, but as soon as he picked up a bass he fell in love with it.Bass is a VERY hard instrument to learn PROPERLY. Especially double bass. Mistakes in intonation and timing are obvious. It takes a very high degree of skill to do it properly, much more so than guitar which can cover up a multitude of sins.As a result of the above factors, he is run off his feet. He gets offers every week to join people\u2019s projects. He turns about 95% of them down. If you want him to play with you, you must be earning good money playing interesting, improvisational music. Also, you must display a completely professional attitude and be easy to get along with. (There is a LOT that I could say about that) Otherwise, no go. He has 1 fun project (a metal band), but the others are working bands playing advanced prog or jazz.I hope that this helps to answer your question. P.S. With regard to the professional attitude bit. He has been known to walk out of rehearsals for new projects after 1/2 hr when it has become obvious that he is the only one who really knows his parts. It happens more than you might think. ",

            "answer_text": "Bands are funny. Too many tone deaf singers. Too many lead guitarists who don't know how to tune the instrument. Too many kids thinking \"loud\" shredding is better. Even Yngwie Malmsteen got annoying at times. Too much is too much. Bass is not a grandstanding instrument. It adds structure, foundation and rhythm. Not a lot of young players are interested in that. They watch too much TV and crap. Bass is always aware of everything going on musically between melody and drums. The best bass players are usually already at least decent guitarists who possesss a healthy understanding of band dynamics. You can be a weak guitarist and get away with bass but one still has to understand the responsibilities of band dynamics or else they'll create a musical mud pit. Most good bassists are down to earth knowledgeable musicians. How many bands have had bassists bounce around from their drama, fallout and a prima-donna attitude? ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine you're a kid and you want to learn to play music and maybe even sing, too. So you decide on an instrument that you can play actual songs with, not parts, songs. And even sing along. So you start with a guitar or a piano.  Guitars are portable, pianos not so much. As your musicianship grows, you decide to take on another instrument and learn more theory and styles and parts. That might lead you to taking up bass, or maybe harmonica, mandolin, banjo, lap steel, pedal steel, organ(not so portable), flute, percussion, etc.  I keep coming back to the portability issue. Basses are either double bass, a fairly large instrument, or electric, requiring rather large amplifiers to lug around and set up.So more than half start out on guitar, then maybe less than 10% of those take up bass so now your down to say 5% of musicians playing bass. Most performing bands have 4 people, more or less. So those 5% of musicians are asked to fill 25% of the positions in a band. Not enough bass players to go around. ",

            "answer_text": "A true bassist is not a burned out guitarist, or a guitar player that got delegated to Bass duties. The reason that good Bass players are hard to find is that the bass role typically is SEEN as a supporting role, and who wants to be subservient? The truth though is that without that low end ,whether felt or heard, the song being played will lack depth and a certain aspect of emotion. Just as in life, you cannot really have those \u201chigh\u201d moments if you don't understand the profundity of those \u201clow\u201d. Truly dedicated Bassist are hard to find because sometimes either the person playing bass by default, or the musicians looking for \u201c a bass player\" don't fully understand or realize the emotional impact that a bassist can offer to a band, or song.

And with a zillion wannabe bass players out there who think that volume = goodness = something very close to but not quite sex, you have to hear a lot of no-go\u2019s before finding the good one. I trained a new bass player from scratch (I don\u2019t play, just showed him where his fingers should go for the notes - made a chart). I should say, sort of trained, because while he was very willing to learn, the first week, and so many people complimented him, he was unteachable after that. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve nailed down \u201cwhy\u201d, which is your question; but perhaps a little of that Why comes out in my meandering answer! ",

So everyone thinks they can be a guitar player. The bar for bass players now is even lower because: A) People don\u2019t notice the bass because of the tinny, small speakered devices music is often listened to on now, so you have a general stereotype of it being inaudible or not mattering. B) Ego. If you actually put a little effort into learning something, bass can be pretty fun. If less people\u2019s greed and egos compelled them to front their own project, we\u2019d have fewer, but musically stronger bands, and maybe not such a disparity in importance placed on the various members of a guitar/rock/pop based band. :-) ",

The answer is true bassists are not abundant. It is a calling not a choice settled on because your a guitar flunky. A real bassist understands the role of holding down the bottom of the pocket, the rythm section, overall dynamics of a song and groove. All of this often inspires learning as much as possible about the nature sound & frequency, composition & arrangement. It is the love of the instrument that fuels all of this thirst for this knowledge. Now if you come across someone starting out all they have to know is they love the bass. The rest of their journey will come. If they have basic skill just be happy because they will explode with talent given a chance and some confidence. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been lucky enough to have never had that problem. My partner is a bass player and singer. When she found doing both too distracting we brought in bass players and have worked with some great ones. On the other other hand we always had trouble finding good drummers. It can be hard to find either because often they want more of a lead role than is actually required. Too many lead bass players and lead drummers out there! Good bass players and drummers understand that their role is to underpin the music - to be the engine. Sadly players like this are rare and so are in high demand. That alone makes them hard to find. Often they are in several bands already. ",

            "answer_text": "From my own band experiences, bass players tended to fall into one of two categories: someone who didn\u2019t play all that well, and a guitarist relegated to bass duties because we already had a guitarist (but the guy playing bass wanted to step into that role). For me, the frustrated guitar players made the best bassists, because they had that New Order/The Jam lead/rhythm bass technique. Lots of melody, lots of creativity, more unique than just holding down the groove. This isn\u2019t to say that holding down the groove isn\u2019t important - it is. But I always like the sound of a \u2018lead\u2019 bass. The big problem with lead bass players is, they don\u2019t keep time as well as someone holding down a groove. They miss their cues more often. They screw up more often. They don\u2019t tend to re-learn holding down a groove. ",

The lead guitarist was on a major ego trip and the bass player is his opinion was only there to fill in the bottom end of the sound, the drummers were usually cool if not great. And then there are the folks who really want to play guitar but as they put it will settle to playing bass if they can get into a band. I feel that good bass players are hard to find due to the fact not many folks really want to play bass as their main instrument. Myself I have a passion to playing bass, would rather play bass that keyboards, guitar, or vocals. The bassist and drummer are the heart beat of the band and those 2 must gel to make the band sound solid and tight. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I think many people are more captivated by the idea of playing guitar than the bass, and that accounts for the lower number of bassists. Amongst the few that play bass, many don\u2019t feel very motivated to be good- they are often put in the background. The key is to find someone who has been playing for at least 3 years consistently, and is comfortable with the instrument and the idea of being a part of the rhythm, not the lead (no bassist should expect a lead role). The more you want your band and music to feature the bassist, the better they have to be. Don\u2019t compromise for a crappy bassist, because that will give you a crappy sound. ",

Us REAL bassists who started out on bass are few and far between. BTW, bass is NOT easy unless you wanna play simple AC/DC or Motley Crue bass lines. Listen to John Myung of Dream Theater or Getty Lee of Rush. Their playing is by no means easy or simple. It takes great physical strength and dexterity to play that way. I like to say that bass is easy to learn but hard to master. ",

A good drummer with a strong rhythmic feel and vibe is more likely to attract a good bass player. Working with a solid drummer is FUN. In the days before PA systems were really mature (meaning big and powerful wide ranging in frequency) and could carry a bass, a bassist used to have to haul around the full bass set of equipment. I used to cart around a Kustom head with two cabinets of twin 15s (remember those pleated babies?) and a Standel with twin 15s. I envied horn players. ",

Lots of really talented technical players might avoid bass because it has become a function more than a musical instrument. The bass can do so much more than hold the bottom and be the glue. ANY instrument can do that. The bass has fallen into a sad state with a few exceptions, like Les Claypool and Flea, over the past 30 years. ",
