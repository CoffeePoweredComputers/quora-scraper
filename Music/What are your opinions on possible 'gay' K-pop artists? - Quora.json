            "answer_text": "It\u2019s wrong to believe that there will certainly be a large number of gay Kpop artists. For example, saying that 10% of kpop artists are gay based on similar patterns in general population demographics is wrong, because the same wouldn\u2019t hold true when saying that 50% of Kpop artists are women (of course Kpop is mostly male artists). Furthermore, gay artists may likely be put off by going into a high pressure industry where their secrets could be exposed at great loss. It\u2019s a lot of risk for what might not be a lot of gain, especially in a society where there\u2019s pressure to stay on a given path as prescribed by parents/society. It may only be recently that an influx of gay trainees will develop soon into a significant gay Kpop artist community. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is gay in parentheses? Are you asking if there are gay Kpop artists? There are! Lots and lots of them. Am I going to tell you who they are? No, no I'm not. They're not out for a reason. Netizens who obsess over an artist's sexuality isn't healthy. Only extreme fans do that. An artist should be liked based on talent and personality not their sexual preferences. ",
