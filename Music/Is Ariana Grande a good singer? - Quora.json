            "answer_text": "I\u2019m answering this question from a formal classical music background for three years: Talent and a naturally pleasant \u2018timbre\u2019. Timbre is the natural color of a voice and this you are either born with or don\u2019t have. Some people are perfectly capable like Ariana Grande to sing in tune, but if you don\u2019t have a \u2018timbre\u2019 people consider pleasant, well then it will simply not sound as pleasing to the ear, no matter how great your singing technique is.Singing from early age on, imitating her idols. She has listened carefully from early age on to singers she liked and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a lot of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey influence going on. Not only is she perfectly capable of imitating them, she also has the wide natural octave range in order to do that. Octave range (the difference between the highest and lowest frequency you can sing clearly) is also something some people will simply be far better at than others. It can be developed to some point, but if one naturally has a wide octave rage like Ariana Grande and a pleasant \u2018timbre\u2019 then you have the basics to become a great vocalist.Training. Although from early age on she felt compelled to sing, obviously she also had tutoring. Maybe not in a formal way like in a classic music academy, but someone has surely tutored her how to extend her vocal and breathing techniques. It\u2019s also the reason why she doesn\u2019t do as many imitations as she used to do: for some imitations she had to stress her vocal chords in a unnatural way, which increased the risk her voice could \u2018break\u2019. It was a tutor who steered her away from doing to many imitations to save her voice for live performances.\u2018Feel\u2019: some people simply have a far better \u2018ear\u2019 and naturally can sing in tune. This can not be teached, it\u2019s a talent. Basically anyone can learn to sing to some degree, but you can\u2019t beat natural talent: it will simply come far easier to someone who has the \u2018ear\u2019 and \u2018feel\u2019 for frequencies.",

            "answer_text": "Ariana Grande, the artist who doesn't want to hit the brakes  The singer has said not in just a few days to Isabel II and to perform at the Grammys for excessive limitations. Now she is launching a new album in which she claims female empowerment In recent times, Ariana Grande has shown a new facet that takes her away from the angelic Nickelodeon girl that raised her to fame. In the eyes of the audience, the 25-year-old, with a voice comparable to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, became a woman and claimed her right to show herself as such. But the biggest change has not been her age or her musical success, but the chain of personal tragedies she has suffered in a short time. After going through a terrorist attack, a failed engagement and the accidental overdose death of a loved one, Grande had every right - as she recounts in one of her latest singles, 7 Rings - to become a \"sad bitch\", but instead she became \"a savage.\" One who has decided to take control of her music, her image, and her relationships. A woman who rejected the title of Lady of the British Empire, awarded by Queen Elizabeth II, because it did not seem right that she should be awarded when the wounds of that attack were still fresh and a singer who said no to the Grammy Awards because they wanted to control the details of his performance. Something that she is no longer willing to accept. Determination is in his blood. As she told Billboard magazine last December, she always knew that her destiny was music. \u201cWhen I was six I decided that this was what I was going to do all my life. Point. I knew it was going to be like that, there was not an iota of doubt in my mind, \"she said.  She found success in 2009, when she was selected to be part of the Victorius children's program and then in 2013, when she made her leap to music with her first album, Yours Truly. Her career began to grow and little by little she positioned herself as a benchmark for female pop. But her whole life fell apart in May 2017 when a man blew herself up in Manchester just after a concert was over. The attack ended with 22 dead - including several children - and hundreds injured. An event that the interpreter cannot overcome today. READ MORE: ",
