            "answer_text": "George\u2019s sound evolved over the years, but his most distinctive sound is his slide guitar work. There was some slide on Yer Blues on the White Album, but George seems to have perfected slide guitar when he worked with Delanie and Bonnie in 1969. He played on some really fine slide guitar songs in the 70\u2032s. For You Blue  Give Me Love  Day After Day\u2014 George playing with Badfinger  Isn\u2019t It A Pity  Cheer Down\u2014 from the 80\u2019s  Leave A Light On For Me \u2014 on Belinda Carlisle\u2019s single in the 90\u2019s  Free as a Bird\u2014 George in the 21st century with The Beatles  ",

            "answer_text": "Keith Richards often said George Harrison had a thin guitar sound. BUT Richards is rarely complimentary of others; a grumpy old man at times. I don\u2019t think George had a signature sound. He went from very clean Gretsch / Vox combinations to a 12 string Rickenback\u2026 Gibson SG with Fuzz\u2026 Slide (which was more Hawaiian sounding than country & western). Harrison was a musican tinkerer. If anything his signature sound would be his use of naughty chords (dominant diminished chords and augmented chords) heard on songs like I Need You. ",
