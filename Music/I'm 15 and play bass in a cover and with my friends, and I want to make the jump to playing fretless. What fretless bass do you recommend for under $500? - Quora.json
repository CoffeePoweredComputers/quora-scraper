The bark of the Jazz Bass pups gave the fretless sound a really cool edge to it. Just make sure to use flat wound strings or you\u2019ll tear up your fretboard with typical round wounds. You probably already know that\u2026 Regretted selling it the second I let it go. Had huge vet bills to pay though. Probably hard to find a new one for under $500, maybe keep an eye out for Christmas sales. I found mine used on Craigslist for $350, was nearly new with a hard shell case and EMG active pups. Good luck in your search. ",

            "answer_text": "I also play a made in Mexico Fender Jazz fretless. I needed to get a replacement for my stolen bass, and out of about 15 basses that I played, the fretless sounded the best, felt the best, and was only about $300 (used). One of the other basses that I passed on was an American Standard Fender Jazz that was priced at $1400 (used!) - the MIM fretless sounded much better! As I had never played a fretless before, I was a little apprehensive but gave it a shot because there are inlays where the frets should be. Since them I\u2019ve played several made in Mexico basses and I find them to be superb instruments, much better than the Squire series, for just a few dollars more (literally, sometimes $20\u201330 more). My opinion? If you\u2019re not sure about switching to fretless, check out one (or more) of these. You won\u2019t be disappointed. ",
