            "answer_text": "Unless you actually break a string, you don\u2019t have to replace them. However, over time the strings will wear and lose some of their resilience. That can result in some of the bounce or zing of the strings going away, leading to a sort of dull or lifeless sound. Some ukulele players swear they have to change strings every few months to keep the bright sound they like. I\u2019ve had another professional musician tell me he hadn\u2019t changed them since he got the instrument (a Style 3 vintage Martin!), but I suspect he was pulling my leg. I don\u2019t change strings very often. I have a custom ukulele that is coming up on three years old, and it still has the original strings on it. I play it probably ten hours a month, as I have a wide variety of instruments and rotate through them pretty regularly. And one of the downsides of new strings is it takes them a while to stretch or settle in. As the knots tighten up and the excess play in the strings stretch out the will start to hold tune for longer periods of time. Bottom line is to change them when you don\u2019t like the sounds your instrument is putting out. A new set of strings can add some bounce to a flat sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Nylon strings seem to hold their tuning for a long time, even with daily playing. As in years, not months. If you use a hard pick, or strum with a very vigorous action, I guess they\u2019ll wear quicker. You can tell that strings need replacing when they won\u2019t stay in tune. I\u2019m assuming that your tuners aren\u2019t slipping and the strings have had time to stretch. It also depends on how demanding you are. My wife isn\u2019t too particular about the sound of her uke, as she uses it mostly to accompany group singing rather than in solos, and generally strums rather than picks. As a three-finger picker, I change the steel strings on my banjos every 2\u20133 months, but then steel strings get work-hardened and lose their even temper. A bit like banjo players. ",
