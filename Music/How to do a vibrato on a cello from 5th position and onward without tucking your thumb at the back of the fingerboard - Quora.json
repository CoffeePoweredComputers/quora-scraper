            "answer_text": "If you already have a confident vibrato technique in the neck positions, the trick is to keep that same flexible, free movement of the forearm as you progress through the transitional positions (roughly 5th through 7th where the thumb is very often left behind the neck) and into thumb position (where, obviously, the thumb is brought up to sit on top of the fingerboard. The main difficulty with vibrato in the transitional positions is that the thumb, left behind the neck, is often pulled quite far away from its location relative to the playing finger, throwing off the balance of the hand and forearm and making things feel awkward. Focus on the sensation of the playing fingertip sinking into the string while allowing the thumb to release as much tension as possible. Do you find, personally, that vibrato is easier to produce in thumb position than in the transitional positions? If so, work on vibrato on those higher, thumb-position pitches during each practice session before you do the same on pitches in the transitional positions. One of the best exercises that I\u2019ve been shown in my Suzuki Method teacher training for capturing the proper physical action of cello vibrato uses a tennis ball. Place the ball on the fingerboard such that you\u2019re pressing down the D-string. Rest your left hand on top of the ball such that it\u2019s cupped in your palm; don\u2019t let your thumb or fingers touch or control the ball. Bow the D-string and use your normal vibrato technique; it should feel remarkably easy for your forearm to shake exactly as it does for a warm, pleasant vibrato. Place the ball on whatever pitches you need to play and bow them. After a few seconds of practice, remove the ball and play as normal with the applicable sounding finger. Repeat in quick cycles. With repeated practice over time, the exercise should help you to find that easy vibrato movement with less struggle. A final note: I must respectfully disagree with Andrew McGregor in describing proper cello vibrato technique as a \u201ctwisting of the wrist\u201d. Using that description almost always elicits a disastrous rotating of the forearm (which many students attempt even without instruction). The result is a terrible, tight, unmusical vibrato sound and a physical habit that, if left to develop at all, becomes extremely difficult to break. The tennis-ball exercise above establishes the much better shaking motion that leaves the wrist aligned and on the surface looks like a straight, lateral motion (that actually hides a slight arc, like what you see in the Johannes Moser video).

            "answer_text": "Not a cellist, so I\u2019m not sure exactly where 5th position is on your neck\u2026 but the mechanics of upper position vibrato is exactly the same on the bass, so here goes\u2026 There are 3 zones of the neck, with three slightly different vibrato techniques. They\u2019re all driven by a twisting motion of your wrist, though. Sounds like you have a problem with your vibrato even in the low positions, if where you are putting your thumb matters at all. What all three zones have in common is that you line up your stopping finger with the axis of your forearm, so there should be a straight line from the stop all the way back to your elbow, and you rotate around that line. The difference is in where you have to put your thumb to simultaneously not lose your reference on the fingerboard and not get in the way of the vibrato. In low positions, the thumb just barely touches the back of the neck\u2026 it plays no part at all in holding the string down, someone should be able to come and very gently pull your thumb clear. What it is there for is to maintain contact so you know where you are; this is far more important on bass with its pivot technique, because extension positions are not an option for bassists. In \u2018transition\u2019 positions, where your natural thumb position isn\u2019t possible any more, the thumb comes around the side of the neck and fingerboard, but it\u2019s the same story until you decide you\u2019re in thumb position. The trick here is, don\u2019t put your thumb on the axis of your arm, it\u2019s the stopping finger. In thumb position, which you can do anywhere on the neck, but have to do in the high positions, your thumb is just another finger, so that\u2019s easy. You have to practice it of course, but it\u2019s not really any different. If you find it easier to do thumb position vibrato than transition\u2026 just go thumb position early, no problem with that. One way to really get choked over vibrato is if you are playing with too much tension\u2026 you should be relaxed, this stuff is fun, and it\u2019s trivial to find the forces you need to play with. All you need to do is let your shoulders relax and drop the weight of your arm on the instrument\u2026 that\u2019s plenty for bass, I bet the trick with cello being so much lighter is not making it slide all over the place or breaking things. If you can do a good tremelo bowing with your right hand, vibrato is very like it with the left\u2026 kind of make your arm rattle like shaking water off, but with a little twist. ",
