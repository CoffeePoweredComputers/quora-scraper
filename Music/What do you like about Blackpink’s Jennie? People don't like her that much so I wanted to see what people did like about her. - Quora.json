            "answer_text": "So\u2026 I have a lot of negative opinions in regards to Blackpink, however my issues spring from their \u201cmusic abilities\u201d and their fans more so than them personally. As the only thing i don\u2019t like about Jennie is her hit and miss effort and her overhyped ability, i will give you a list of things that i like and feel everyone can appreciate even if they don\u2019t like Jennie or blackpink. This may look long but it\u2019s mostly pictures! She loves the members and encourages them whenever she canIf she gets the chance she will hype them one example is when Jisoo was \u2018shooting hoops\u2019 and missing. Jennie kept cheering and when talking to the staff she sounded like a proud mum, saying how Jisoo does what makes her happy. Jennie couldn't help but watch and cheer for Jisoo with a huge smile on her faceWhen they need to show a dance move she immediately looks to Lisa and encourages her to show the move since dance is Lisa's expertiseShe\u2019s just soft for rosie  She can be cute, hot and just straight up prettyShe doesn\u2019t have the stand out appearance that Blinks claim but she is pretty and can pull off a variety of concepts     her stage outfits\u2026granted not really \u2018her\u2019 but she pulls them off amazingly    her personal style\u2026 uhm girl slay with that shiz     I could post pictures of her fashion all day but i don\u2019t have time! i like that she is soft and caring - she cares in a abstract way, as in she isn't so obvious in her actions a lot of the timeshe is still young and childish - i do think she\u2019s putting on the \u2018cute\u2019 more so than she is a naturally cute person. i think she's adorable when she isn\u2019t trying to be cuteshe loves her fans - there's no doubt to thatI LOVE THAT SHE HAS BROUGHT ENERGY TO THIS COMEBACK - watching their live performances you can see how much she has improved after her last little \u2018stunt\u2019. when i was watching the performances i felt as though Lisa lacked energy in comparison to usual, not to the extent that it needs to be called out but she doesn't have the same level as before, Jennie has made up for the lack of energy this time.In my opinion she is the most talented out of the members - now i don\u2019t think they are worthy of the hype they have at all, the rap line are not a rap line since they don\u2019t write their own stuff, they don\u2019t create the flow ect, but she is better at recreating somebody else's work better than Lisa. Her vocals are good, yet she could still use a lot of training. her dancing is good, has natural swag, this however is only the case when she puts in the effort.she oozes confidence even though she is a shy person - when she has to she can make it seem like she is the reason we are all here, she\u2019s the reason the stage was created - you know the kinda vibe I'm on about? basically she owns what she needs to.",

            "answer_text": "I like Jennie because she is honestly just so cute when she show her cute side. That gummy smile of hers is really warming to me. That a side, I love the fact that she is so fashionable. She changes her style quite frequently but there is not a single outfit of hers that I don\u2019t like. Plus, most of my outfits ideas were inspired by her. Secondly, I like her vocals. Really, if you didn\u2019t know why she\u2019s getting the verse, it\u2019s because that her vocal is stable and powerful. ( I\u2019m not saying that Jisoo\u2019s vocal is any less than hers so please don\u2019t come at me, thank you. ) Thirdly, we can\u2019t forget that she is kind and caring. She cares about her friends, members and fans. If she just another jerk, why do chulicheang smile so genuinely to her? Don\u2019t get intimidated by that rested bitch face of hers, she\u2019s really a different person than what that face of hers shows. That I can assure you. And about the lazy scandal, ( I know this is unnecessary but I just want to put it out there ) for me, that problem was honestly blown way out of proportion. Yes, she was lacking but all we know and heard were from the internet. We never heard from her side, accusing her as lazy, immature, selfish and so on, just because of a couple of her lacking performances is just not right. A performer does that sometimes, and it can\u2019t be helped. There will be times when we are just simply lacking, that\u2019s just how emotions works sometimes. ",
