Radiohead - Fitter Happier I\u2019m listening to it as I write this and my take on the piece is that it\u2019s so emotionally draining due to the lack of sympathy purposely provided by the locutor by telling you everything you have to do in order to be \u201caccepted\u201d in a society. But by doing it you become less and less happy due to the rules and standards impossed. Kind of ironical in a way. Hare Krishna ",
