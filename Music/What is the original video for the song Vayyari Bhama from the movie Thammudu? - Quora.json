            "answer_text": "Actually this is not the original. Ramana Gogula had released this song as an album which was very popular on \u2018Radio City\u2019, way before it was used in the movie \u2018Thammudu\u2019. The lyrics of the first original version are as follows: Hey pilla nee peru lovely Bedi laga unnayi nee kallu Hey pilla nee nadaka chuste Naa gundelo Jallu jallu. Vayarri Bhama Nee Hamsa Nadaka Enduke Ee thondara thondara Rathri vela ee chikatlo Enduko naa gundalo Alajada. Somehow the original song is no where to be found. I guess it\u2019s some copyright issues with the movie. A person who has heard the original song will not like the movie version. That\u2019s at least 2 curious people looking for the original! :-) ",
