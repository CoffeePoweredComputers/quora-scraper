            "answer_text": "It depends on your goals, and how well you want to sing. Untrained singers having good technical singing can be a fluke, where someone might use correct technique. They might have mimicked a good technician correctly, but most of the time the untrained singer has limited ear training and sensation awareness. These are things that can be learned for certain only with help from a great teacher. The chance that someone who doesn\u2019t have that awareness will create poor vocal habits is high. They may sound great when they\u2019re young, but it\u2019s probable that they will create tension and strain in the voice. They may not notice it right away, but it will catch up to them in their 30\u2019s, and if they have based their singing on a certain sound that is created by poor vocal habits and they do not learn the correct technique and fix it, they can lose their ability to sing at all. If you\u2019re going to sing occasionally, it probably won\u2019t matter. You can sing however you like. You can get by. If you grew up listening to great vocalists, it\u2019s possible that your technique is correct, but the only way to verify is to have your singing technique evaluated by a superior teacher with trained ears and observation ability. It must be someone who understands the voice and can determine whether your technique is really that good and whether you sound as good as you and others around you think. If you have aspirations of any kind for improving your singing technically, so that you can sing smoothly with better clarity, less nasality, more resonance and projection, and can hold the high and low notes of all the songs you want to sing, you need training. Doing it a lot is not the point. You need consistent, correct practice, in appropriate doses, over a period of months and years. You\u2019re training muscles for vocal coordination, including breathing, muscles that control vocal folds, your habits in body posture, the muscles in your face. Your training your muscle memory, and consistent, correct technique is the way to maximize your singing output. A good teacher will help you get your technique down, one aspect at a time, by giving you the specific exercises your voice needs - these can change based on whether you are too tight or too loose. Your voice initially may need to be tricked into doing things you didn\u2019t know it could, and when your technical singing reaches a certain level, they can help you understand the performance aspect as well. There are a number of answers on Quora about how to improve your singing without a vocal teacher or coach, without lessons, because it can be very cost-prohibitive. If you can\u2019t afford singing lessons, there are usually ways to work on your breathing technique, ear training, and body awareness, by online videos or from vocalists you hear and watch. If you have friends that sing or a school choir, or see live performances, that can help you get some ideas. You can study the pedagogy and science for free online. Save up, and try to get enough for a few lessons to get you started. I wanted to take lessons for years but didn\u2019t feel I could justify the cost. Three years ago at age 39, I finally decided I couldn\u2019t be happy without fixing my singing voice - I was struggling for air even when speaking, and had I not decided to get lessons, I would not have known that it was a poor vocal habit that was entirely correctable. This is the one thing I really do for myself, these singing lessons, and I have never once regretted it - the investment in my voice has made me really happy, and that is joy that could not have been replaced.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no\u2026. Anyone can sing. If you can speak and sustain a tone/sound with your voice\u2026. you\u2019re technically singing (though that\u2019s probably not what you mean).You don\u2019t need voice lessons to be able to sing. Though sometimes it can help (especially if you want to focus on a specific style of singing, or work on particular singing techniques).I\u2019ve worked with vocal teachers who claim that most people who say they are \u201ctone deaf\u201d are not actually \u201ctone deaf\u201d\u2026. they just need to practice. Usually, this means practicing matching notes with your voice. Playing an instrument can actually help a lot with this. Any instrument will do\u2026 though I like guitar and talk more about this here.Singing a lot can help, but it can also hurt if you\u2019re doing it badly (i.e. not matching notes correctly, singing out of tune, singing out of key, or singing in a way that strains your voice/vocal cords/diaphragm/etc). If you\u2019ve never had any vocal training, you may want to take a lesson or two with a vocal coach or even check out some youtube videos on singing.Also, remember that \u201csinging well\u201d or \u201cgood voices\u201d can be subjective. What sounds amazing to you\u2026 may sound terrible to me. Practice, practice, practice. But make sure you practice the right stuff (and don\u2019t hurt yourself)!",

I\u2019ve heard many trained singers who hold back because they are so afraid of doing something wrong that they are devoid of energy or style. They are trained to control their tone so much that they are carbon copies of other trained singers and there is little unique about them. Their vowels are so pure that it is sometimes difficult to unnastan em. I\u2019ve heard high school kids whose only training was copying B\u2019way cast recordings and as a result sing with conviction and are excellent imitators of the professionals rather than someone imitating vocal exercises. My advice is to take lessons but never give up the wide eyed wonder and surprise of living music. Fly free. This question reminds me of the story about the MEADOWLARK. Here is a trained singer, Betty Buckley, selling it.  ",

If you just like singing, do it strictly for pleasure and the people who hear you don\u2019t mind how you sound, then by all means belt it out as often as you want. If you want to really train, though, practicing a lot without coaching means you pratice your mistakes and can easily turn them into difficult-to-break bad habits. Some of these bad habits can even damage your voice permanently if done for too long. There are two criteria to judge if you\u2019re doing it right: it feels easy and it sounds good. What feels easy is for you to tell - it\u2019s your throat and your body. However, what you hear is NOT what other people hear, so you can\u2019t go by that to know if it sounds good. That\u2019s why you need a voice coach. There will be the odd person who is gifted with a voice that is naturally well placed, but the people who can train themselves to a professional level without any help are extremely rare, especially since there are a lot of other things besides voice technique that make a good singer.
