            "answer_text": "There are several reasons: To create stereo width: Lead vocals are panned centre. Adding reverb allows the vocal to participate in the stereo image more.To create a sense of space or depth: \u201cWetter\u201d vocals will sound further away. Background vocals will be sent a little more to the reverb aux to make them feel \u201cbehind\u201d the lead vocal, for instance.To create a \u201ctail\u201d that blends in with music on a \u201cstage\u201d: Reverb allows notes to carry longer after the vocalist has finished singing them. Previous notes will stack up on following notes when sung in quick succession, creating subtle chords that can be heart-achingly beautiful. On the final note in a passage, the tail will carry on after the singer is finished singing final the syllable, fading and blending back into the music, creating a haunting, musical effect. (Keep in mind that most of the best mix engineers will usually use one or two main reverb units and send almost all instruments to them\u2014even if only a little bit\u2014to create a coherent, blended stage).To create interest: Sometimes making a vocal sound somewhat bizarre with more extreme reverb settings can be what makes it stand out!",

            "answer_text": "For a few reasons: To make the vocal more pleasing to the ears To allow the vocal to sit better within a mix. Careful with how much reverb. the more you put on, the more it makes it appear that there vocal is further back in the mix. It is never a good thing to use too much reverb. Many do, because they don\u2019t like the sound of their voice. But it sounds worse when it sounds as though you are singing in a bathtub. Best to use a tad of reverb, particularly if you have good vocal tone. Less reverb gives more of a feel of intimacy, particularly in ballads. it is as though the person is singing directly to you. ",
