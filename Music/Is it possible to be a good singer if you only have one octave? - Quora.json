            "answer_text": "If by \"good\" you mean \"affecting\" then yes - and for my money, that's what makes a singer worth listening to. Wide vocal ranges are impressive, but they mean little if there isn't any [genuine] emotional content (when was the last time you heard someone sing the national anthem at a baseball game, while also thinking \"Wow, you can tell it really means something to them!\" - and those singers certainly have a good range).  Computers and Barbara Streisand can hit notes perfectly - and there are plenty of people out there who can do unimaginable vocal gymnastics - though it's worth being clear with yourself if that's what you want to do.

            "answer_text": "It's certainly possible to start to be a good singer with just a one octave range. Find yourself a good coach and before you know it, your range will start to improve very quickly. Sometimes, even on the first lesson (which can totally shock beginners!). A good coach will be able to assess and map out your range and other vocal goals. Find one with a good track record of working with beginners. Good luck! And welcome to the world of singing! ",
