            "answer_text": "No. It sometimes leads to extreme bad taste in the writing of the lyrics, so hate speech is another way of seeing rap. Rap, at its best, is fast-spoken poetry, more leaning to rapid rhymes and then reinforcing these with similar ones. It's sometimes so fast that it sabotages itself. Poetry is more leisurely, because it's meant to communicate to one and all, rather than rap does, to what seems more like a chosen few. It's a competitive art form that often gets a quick audience response that many poets simply don't get at all. So it's gained in popularity, despite the offensive lyrics every now and then. Performers can move about across a stage, as if firing up separate members of an audience. It's point a finger in your face time, or crouching down to be in your face instead. It's confrontational and sometimes with a righteous anger style. So it's not always helpful flicking TV channels and reaching the music channels, where anything goes and a bleeper is used to mask a swear word, or two, or three, or four or more. So enjoy what you can, or just what you can tolerate...: ",

            "answer_text": "While rap is poetry, I wouldn\u2019t say it is \u201cjust\u201d poetry. The Beatles set poetry to music, but it wasn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d poetry. Nor was it \u201cjust\u201d singing. It was something new, and revolutionary at the time. When rap first hit the airwaves, it was something very different. Now we take it for granted, the way we take the Beatles for granted. But the Beatles helped create something new, and so did the early rappers. We shouldn\u2019t get jaded just because an art form has been around awhile. ",
