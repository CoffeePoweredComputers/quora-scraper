Martin Hannett who famously produced Joy Division\u2019s two albums. And I still cannot escape the shadow of Hank Shocklee and the Bomb Squad on Public Enemy\u2019s classic records. I\u2019m also a huge fan of Ron Temperton\u2019s arrangements when he was in Heatwave, and later on working with Quincy Jones on Michael Jackson\u2019s hit albums in the 80\u2019s. ",
