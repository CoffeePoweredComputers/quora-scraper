            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. Is like what happens with Kpop in the US. They are always the Gaijin(Foreigner),Even Twice or SNSD, they are foreigners, that\u2019s their main appeal. I\u2019m using BTS and Twice as an example of this. BTS japanese pronunciation and fluency is really low,You FEEL their accent through their songs,so it feels foreign. Same with Twice,As Mina ,Tzuyu,Momo and Sana are criticized in their pronunciation,Tzuyu and the kankokujin(Korean members) are criticized because of their accent. Jpop doesn\u2019t even try,They are japanese,have the sound Japanese youth likes and have BRAND RECOGNITION. If you say your boy group is from the company that made Arashi or is a Johnny it sure sells. Same with Anything related to Exile, 48/46, Morning musume, Hello project or Akihabara Next Door.They WILL sell and if it sells bad it will still be thousands. Twice in japan is against HUGE BRAND NAMES. Like AKB48 or Nogizaka46 Jpop is on a league of their own.Kpop is like the popular kid in high school vs the real celebrities. As an added foe,they have to go against American pop which is also big in Japan. ",
