            "answer_text": "Yeah, I\u2019m with Bill I wouldn\u2019t say Ukulele is the easiest instrument to play full stop, I learned harmonica first back in the dark ages and all that took was a good ear, time and plenty of wind (never short in the young). It is probably the easiest of the plucked / strummed stringed instruments to learn and attain any level of skill at, strings are easy on a new comer as well, just do yourself a favour and don\u2019t buy a $20 special, budget about $200 U.S. and you\u2019ll have something you\u2019ll be happy to play for a long time. Also consider a Tenor Uke for versatility. I just bought my Daughter a Cort Tenor Uke made out of solid Tasmanian Blackwood which is the same species of wood as the favoured Koa for the traditional instruments. Her\u2019s set me back around $500 Au bit it was worth every cent. Anyone who tells you Ukulele is not a real instrument point them at this guy (who plays a Tenor for interests sake.  Regards Ari ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking to learn a few chords so you can strum some simple accompaniments while you sing, then yeah, its pretty easy. An acquaintance of mine who sang but had never played before, bought a uke and attended a beginner class at a local ukulele festival one August weekend, a couple of years ago. By December, she was accompanying herself on the uke and had learned a bunch of songs in a variety of keys. On the other hand, if you want to play like this guy:  Or like this guy:  \u2026..it will take quite a while longer to learn. ",
