            "answer_text": "So here\u2019s the secret of how genres are worked out. In record shops, they used to put similar kinds of music together, so that you didn\u2019t have to browse through the Mantovani to get to the Metallica. Those distinctions were called genres. They had to call them something, so they got vaguely descriptive names, like pop, rock, jazz, blues. Now there\u2019s so much music that even narrowing it to that level isn\u2019t enough, so we have an ever lengthening list of sub-genres that are supposed to distinguish between the slightest nuances of style between one artist and the next. Fandom being what it is, there are always plenty of numpties ready to argue that this or that album isn\u2019t \u2018proper\u2019 bebop, or whatever. This is particularly true in the niche markets, where fans (for deep-seated but inexplicable psychological reasons) feel a personal proprietorial ownership of the music, as part of their own identity, and get disappointed if it goes mainstream. By this point the record shops have lost interest; they certainly aren\u2019t going to create a special sales area for the two records on issue which can be defined as \u2018acid grime\u2019 or whatever the latest thin slice of music has been called. But the music buying world is now so obsessed with these arbitrary and finely-cut distinctions that a particularly creative artist might, in the course of one album, produce work in several different \u2018genres\u2019. The truth is that the difference between art rock and progressive rock is whatever you want it to be, or if you don\u2019t want it to be, then it doesn\u2019t exist; there is no difference. It\u2019s just music. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot of similarity. I\u2019m not sure how important it is to try to make too fine grained distinctions. I\u2019m sure many bands / artists can be considered both. But Progressive rock tends to put more of its artistic emphasis on the music itself : maybe longer, more elaborate arrangements with different sections in different styles. Art rock may do that but might also be content with fairly ordinary song-structures but given an aesthetic twist because of a new instrument, or lyrical trick or even just the style of presentation. I may be off here, but take someone like David Bowie. He\u2019s clearly very \u201cart\u201d, from the costumes / personas, style, musical experimentation, deep cultural interest etc. I think putting him in an \u201cart rock\u201d category would make a lot of sense. But he\u2019s not really very \u201cprog\u201d. Most of his songs follow fairly typical verse / bridge / chorus structures. They\u2019re well crafted and catchy pop/rock. But not musically elaborate or bringing layers of complexity. ",
