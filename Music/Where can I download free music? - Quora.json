            "answer_text": "The reason that 66 people answered your question is because, of course, there is no place on the internet where you can download free music. So what\u2019s your next question? Getting back to my original sentence, I don\u2019t feel that music is \u201cfree\u201d unless you do not have to provide attribution, you can use it for commercial purposes, you can break up individual songs and use just parts of them, the music is also royalty-free, and you can even resell the music in any form you like. It\u2019s not even worth looking for \u201cfree\u201d music on the internet. It doesn\u2019t exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Follow as many bands as you can.  Fill in their questionnaires, go to their gigs, support them in any way you can, even if that doesn't mean money. Make sure the bands can contact you.  Many bands will give away free stuff, like CDs.  Sometimes, they'll even put albums on their sites for download for free for limited periods. By following closely, you'll be there when it happens.  It's their way of rewarding loyal fans like you. Best way I know, because you also give something back to the bands in question. ",
