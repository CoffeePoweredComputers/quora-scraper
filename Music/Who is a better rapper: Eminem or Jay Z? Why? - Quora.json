            "answer_text": "Jay-Z is the better rapper . When comparing these two , alot of people will say Eminem is a better lyricist or has a better flow . I beg to differ . Eminem has a very good flow , but alot of people seem to think that because Eminem raps really fast it equates to his flow being the best . This is a matter of preference I guess. But I give Jay-Z the nod over Em here because Jay-Z shows versatility in his flows . He went from a fast flow to a more relaxed , smooth flow , but has been known to switch flows in order to accommodate the beat . In contrast Eminem's flow is one dimensionsal and predictable. Eminem has been known to stick to his usual flow even when the beat doesn't call for it . Now for the lyricsism . Eminem is a great lyricist , but there are different types of lyricists. . Eminem is a great \u201ctechnical writer \u201c, by this I mean he excels in putting words and rhymes together in a complex manner that allows for his fast ,tongue twisting flow and an intricate rhyme scheme. Infact Eminem might be the greatest technical writer of all time . Only challenged By Nas . Jay-Z is a more content oriented lyricist , whos lyrics are full of depth and wit . Jay writes thoughtful, sometimes poetic , witty rhymes, and often makes use of double entendres and powerful metaphors . I have to give Jay the Nod here . Again this comes to preference .I prefer lyricists who say the most with the least amount of words . By no means am I implying that Eminem raps 1000 bits of \u201cjibberish\u201d per second . But Jay-Z rhymes have more staying power and impact. Eminems lyrics catch the attention because of the complexity of his rhyme schemes and sometimes the shock value and absurdity of his rhymes . Jay-Z's rhymes tend to have more depth and poetic value in each bar . And finally let's get to the music . This is where Jay is far superior to Eminem . Em had a solid , some might even say classic ,discography up until \u201cThe Eminem Show\u201d . Encore followed in 2004 , a respectable , luke warm album . 2009\u2019s relapse is where Ems music really started going south. I would say this is a matter of opinion but it's not . All of Eminem's albums since relapse are weak and very pop oriented . At its worse , his music is bubblegum flavoured, preservative infested processed noise . It's bad . It's almost comical . He does the same I'm rapping slow , but wait now I'm speeding up and shouting angrily flow over pop beats featuring Katy Perry or whoever is the new princess of pop song over and over. Jay-Z in contrast has a far more impressive and consistent catalogue than Em . Sure he's had a few slip ups but he's always come back with good quality follow ups . Last year's 4:44 was a mature , meaningful , quality effort . Eminem's revival album , was not very impressive to say the least In conclusion : -Jay z is the better rapper -Fast Flow does not equal lyricist/good rapper /best flow The last point is really important . Especially if you're an aspiring rapper , who lives in the suburbs . We don't need anymore Machine Gun Kellys or Yelawolf's . Peace . ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say Eminem but it\u2019s actually closer than people think. Eminem and Jay-Z both have good technical skills when it comes to rapping. Of course, they\u2019re both slightly overhyped for it due to their popularity but there\u2019s no denying that they both have great lyrics and songwriting abilities that many run of the mill rappers would love to acquire. However, they\u2019re styles are pretty disparate. Eminem\u2019s technical rapping style is more influenced by Kool G Rap, Rakim, Pharoahe Monch, Big Pun, Big L, Chino XL, Redman, and even Nas to a certain degree. He basically puts a big emphasis on multi-syllable rhyme schemes and assonance that\u2019s delivered with a direct flow in the songs. This was a trait that was carried on from the early part of his rap career in the mid-1990\u2019s during the recording of Infinite and working alongside the Outsidaz rap group from New Jersey. Jay Z\u2019s rapping style, by contrast, is much more poetic and doesn\u2019t revolve as much around technical prowess, even though Jay Z is still a pretty good technical rapper but not quite top tier in that category. With Jay Z, there\u2019s more emphasis on double entendres, subtle meanings, metaphors, and clever wordplay than Eminem. With that being said, Jay Z is hardly the best in this category and is actually a tier below Lupe Fiasco in this regard but Jay Z still have some really great usage of that poetic style of rapping, even in some of his throwaway songs such as \u201cBrooklyn We Go Hard\u201d, where he casually delivers a triple entredre in one of his lines, referencing Jackie Robinson. They\u2019re songwriting styles are also quite disparate. Eminem uses more raw emotion and aggression in his voice to carry out his messages, similar to Tupac, Ice Cube, Chuck D, and even Scarface to an extent. When Eminem wants to express a certain feeling and emotion through his songs, you will detect it quite easily with his voice, tone, and delivery similar to the aforementioned rappers. Eminem also employs more shock value or horrorcore style content as well, which was likely influenced by the Memphis rap scene in the 1990\u2019s with Three Six Mafia or even certain subgenres of rock music. Basically, with Eminem, there\u2019s more outwardly stimulating content that directly touches a listeners\u2019 emotions, especially during his prime. Jay-Z, on the other hand, is more subtle. Jay-Z is the type of rapper where you have to actually analyze his words to truly capture the essence of what he\u2019s trying to convey. Then, when it hits you, you realize that Jay-Z is a lot more clever lyrically then you thought. There are some Jay-Z songs where I have listened to some of the lyrics casually without thinking about the meaning of the content, then it\u2019ll either hit me or I\u2019ll discover the meaning of his lyrics and become stunned. Flow-wise, Jay-Z ironically has a more seasoned \u201cchopping\u201d(see: speed rapping) background than Eminem, having worked with Jaz-O(the godfather of \u201cchopping\u201d) early on in his career. However, Eminem has stepped up his game in the field and has been featured on more songs where he utilizes his \u201cchopping\u201d ability to the fullest extent(\u201cSpeedom\u201d, \u201cRap God\u201d, \u201cHomicide\u201d, etc.) than Jay-Z. That doesn\u2019t mean Jay-Z couldn\u2019t pull it off himself but it\u2019s hard to say when it hasn\u2019t happened yet. As far as general flowing goes, both have a pretty good cadence in most of their songs while having somewhat uncomfortable sounding flows in some circumstances where they sound out of place. One difference I noticed is that Jay Z has more of a Big-L type of flow where he flows his words together more smoothly while Eminem has more of an animated, Redman style flow. Either way, they both have great flows for most of their songs. Then, you have to take into account discography. Now, if you asked me who had a better discography in 2014, I\u2019d say neither because they both had a combination of classic albums, slighly above average albums, and straight up mediocre albums. For Eminem, The Marshall Mathers LP and the Eminem Show would be his undisputed classics. The Slim Shady LP, Infinite, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, would be his slighly above average albums. Then, Encore, Recovery, and Relapse would be his mediocre albums. For Jay-Z, Reasonable Doubt and The Bluprint would be his undisputed classics. The Black Album, the entire Volume series(3 albums), and American Gangster would be his above average albums. Then, the 2nd and 3rd Blueprints, Kingdom Come, and Magna Carta Holy Grail would be his mediocre albums. The Slim Shady LP and The Black Album to me are borderline classics but I wouldn\u2019t correct anybody who suggested that they were undisputed classics as well. When it comes to consistency, neither Eminem or Jay-Z has the edge. However, as of 2019, I would give Jay Z the edge for discography simply because 4:44 and Everything is Love were both MUCH better than Revival and Kamikaze in almost every catagory. Kamikaze was okay but Revival was just downright unlistenable for me. To me, it\u2019s not even comparable and Jay Z is showing grand improvement from the garbage heaps he dropped in 2009 and 2013 while Eminem is barely better than he was in the Relapse/Recovery or Marshall Mathers LP 2 era. Also, the beat selection is usually better with Jay-Z than Eminem on average which helps with discography and replay value. So, why do I think Eminem is better, you ask? It\u2019s simply because Eminem\u2019s highs are bigger and better than Jay-Z\u2019s highs. If Nas wrote \u201cEther\u201d for Eminem, there\u2019s a much higher chance that Eminem would write up a better diss track and push Nas into a corner. Eminem has also outshined people on their songs at a much higher rate than Jay-Z. Eminem also had more dominance at his peaks(2000 and 2002) then Jay-Z did in his(2001 and 2003). His battle rap and freestyling history is also more impressive as well. I\u2019m hardly a big Eminem fan(I rarely even listen to his music beyond the year 2002) but I\u2019d give Eminem the slight advantage overall. ",
