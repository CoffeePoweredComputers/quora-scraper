            "answer_text": " Rookie Historian Goo Hae-ryung - During the Josean Dynasty historians were kept on staff to provide an impartial record of the government for the benefit of posterity. When the King decides to allow woman to be hired into this important position men are shocked but some women are excited about the opportunity to be something other than a wife and mother and eventually earn the respect and support of their male coworkers. One of these women receives encouragement from the handsome Prince that loves her and who secretly also wishes to reach beyond the expectations of others. An unexpected gem that easily made it to a high place on my Very Favorites list.  100 Days My Prince-Crown Prince who cannot forget or move on from his lost first love gets amnesia after an assassin attack and is tricked into believing that he is just a poor peasant. He soon he finds himself living in a village with a new wife and no useful skills to survive as a peasant. During the next hundred days he finds joy for the first time since he was a young boy and then his memory returns and he goes back to the political strife of palace life. Loved everything about this fun drama except the cliche secondary character\u2019s fate.   Beauty Inside The lead couple each have a physical disorder that must be kept secret. She is sweet and caring and ready to help anyone in need and relies on the help of friends while he has built a cold wall of distrust around himself, isolating him from friends, family and happiness.-Also loved the secondary couple. She is cliche cold hearted bad girl and he is a sweet irresistibly cute boy who would give up his dream to become a Priest for a girl like that. Adapted from a Korean movie which was adapted from a web series produced jointly by Toshiba,Intel, and Facebook.  Cinderella and the Four Nights - Chaebol grandfather brings his estranged grandsons together to live in the family estate in hopes that they can become a real family. Their backgrounds and their personalities are completely different and it seems that the only thing that they have in common is that they all lost their fathers, the sons of the grandfather, at an early age and the only thing that they agree on is their dislike for each other. As a last resort he hires a strong willed high school girl to move into the mansion and straighten those boys out. I am skeptical about romcoms but this one is proof that some romance based romcoms can be really great fun and well written.  Emperor: Ruler of the Mask - After an assassinations attempt on his infant son the King commands that he wear a mask so that no one will know his identity until he is crowned. When his father is assassinated the Prince uses this to his advantage by inserting an impostor in his place while secretly plotting his revenge. Really liked the secondary female more than the lead as she proved her love through sacrifice instead of jealousy and was a strong female character. Unfortunately the cliche fate of the secondary male was a very disappointing ending for me but until then I enjoyed it.  Faith (The Great Doctor) - After his Queen is mortally wounded a soldier from Goryeo travels through a time portal to our time to find a doctor that can save her. While forcing the surgeon to return with him he makes a promise that he will bring her back to her time (or die trying). Unfortunately enemy schemes and their growing love make that a difficult promise to keep.  Goblin: The Lonely and Great God - After nine centuries of watching his loved ones die an immortal man just wants to die too. I loved everything about this drama including the bromance and the Goblin\u2019s bride in this tale of reincarnation and immortality.  Protect the Boss - Comedy about a former high school tough girl who is hired as a secretary for the Chairman\u2019s son in hope that she can improve, or at least tolerate his behavior. Really every single one of Ji Sung\u2019s dramas depict strong and intelligent female characters. ",

Unemployed high school graduate Do Bong Soon (Park Boyoung) was chosen to be a body guard for Ahn Minhyeok (Park Hyungsik, member of ZE:A) because of her superhuman strength. It's gotta be my favorite K-Drama as of yet. It's like a rom-com mixed with thriller and action. Definitely have a watch if you haven't already! ",
