            "answer_text": "Bear with me. I have an analogy that applies, I hope. I knew a man when I was in grad school, who always found a way to brag about something in spite of the obvious facts that the rest of us could plainly see. During a Xmas break, a few of us were in the office and my advisor came in and asked us all to come play basketball. I\u2019m from Indiana. It\u2019s in our blood. Like many Hoosiers, I had played the game since I was 4 years old. We took the court, and this man began talking about how he didn\u2019t really ever play, but while others played, he practiced the half court shot, and he was an expert at it. When we were done playing, (and, by the way, he was miserable throughout the scimmage), he walked out to half court, and took about 10 shots. When one went in, he puffed out his chest and strutted around like the peacock we all knew he was. I asked for the ball and, I swear this is true, I made 5 shots in a row. I didn\u2019t say anything to him, except, \u201cWhen all those other guys were playing, and you were practicing your half court shot, I was playing with them.\u201d Now, how does that apply to your question? Well, stop worrying about playing one song perfectly. Just play. In time, you will be able to understand what playing is all about and you\u2019ll have thousands of songs that you will be able to play all the way through without making any glaring errors, including a few songs you never practiced at all before. Just PLAY! One small footnote here: I have tried a few hundred times to replicate the 5 consecutive shots, and never did it again. I have gotten to 3 fairly often, but never 5. I bask in my good fortune, however, that it happened on the perfect occasion. ",

            "answer_text": "Break the song down into its parts: intro, verse, chorus, bridge, etc. Now, instead of tackling a whole song, just tackle a section. You\u2019ll find that, many times, the intro is actually a segment of the verse or chorus. And once you\u2019ve learned the verse structure, it usually is the same for all the verses. Many of the sections are going to be similar. As noted in other answers, once you learn a segment, play it over and over again. You\u2019ll also discover that many solos are based on patterns. Popular music is based on \u201chooks,\u201d which can be a lyric, a melody, or a solo riff. They\u2019re meant to be memorable, so they\u2019re repeated. (Listen to the end of \u201cHotel California\u201d for the dueling guitars. Listen to the sax on \u201cBaker Street.\u201d) Once you learn to dissect a song, you\u2019ll find that the pieces themselves aren\u2019t so ovewhelming. ",
