            "answer_text": "Many Pros take much less time than you think\u2026 If the song is well thought out\u2026 composed for \u2018production\u2019 it could be 1 to 3 days in the studio. Then again they usually KNOW what they can count on\u2026 engineer - mixer - masterer - equipment - talent performance - etc. But most pros I knew\u2026 never tried to really fix it in the mix\u2026 they knew what they were after and how to get it. And that was it. I really believe on producing a song in your head WHERE you know you can get those sounds\u2026 if you can\u2019t you should have a plan b? Top line wealthy Producers\u2026 don\u2019t have a problem usually. I mean if you take the best with the best then it usually comes out real good. For run of the mill producers who don\u2019t have the talent or expertise or equipment available it can be a real struggle - but it can be fun. If you are a one man show\u2026 things are much different too. You can spend a year on a song\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Writing as someone who does music production/recording/composing as a hobby, more than I should. I spent probably 100+ hours on my band\u2019s last song only to get to the end and being thoroughly unhappy with the result and deciding to start all over again. I have been doing this with the goal of reaching the professional quality level for 6 years. Our last EP (4 songs) took me 4 years to complete and it\u2019s nowhere near what one would call professional. My tip to all those treading the same road is, GET IT RIGHT IN THE RECORDING STAGE! You\u2019ll spent countless hour trying to save something that cannot be saved in the production just because the mic was 2 inches to the left and was getting a lot of resonance from the guitar, or the singer\u2019s bracelet tingling as she sang , or the hum from the computer, etc. Anyway, getting better everyday\u2026 (I hope!)
