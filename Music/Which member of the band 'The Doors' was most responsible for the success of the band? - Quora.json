            "answer_text": "As with almost all questions like this the answer is: None, a great band is a perfect mix of its members. Just try to imagine Jim\u2019s voice without Ray\u2019s unique keyboard. Bobby\u2019s guitar without that very specific Densmore drum. Their mix created an unique sound, and you can see from the ill-advised attempts to record after Jim\u2019s death what happens if one cog in the machine is gone. But the same would have been the case if one of the others had been missing. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the Doors - from their inception created a unique collaborative sound, whose individual elements just worked. The drummer infused an afro-brazilian/calypso vibe. The guitarist added flamenco/rock/jazz elements. The keyboardist brought in a quirky jazz-rock-pop element. But Jim Morrison was ultimately the key. Because was able to incorporate these disparate influences and sounds, into his poetic, dramatic and charismatic persona, that jumps off the records and explodes live. 'Break on through' and 'light my fire' are just two prominent examples of how it all works. ",
