            "answer_text": "er\u2026well, MAYBE there is (!) A large number of coincidences happened to me in early 1988. There were so many in a short period of time - Feb 14th 1988 providing the focus for six - on recurrent themes with more than a few individual examples very striking and with many of them supportable by documentary evidence that it seemed to me - for those five reasons - to be stretching the laws of probability in attributing the whole charabanc to nothing more than chance. But that is a personal opinion. No testable claim may be applied and no repeatable experiment performed neither. I felt I must advance it to someone else to see whether it seemed to them also to be stretching the laws of probability. So, having first met with a dismissal from an acknowledged writer and broadcaster on paranormal matters, I stopped a guy in the street and asked for his opinion on it all. What happened next you may read here between points (45) and (51) -The Narrative, plus Epilogues and Appendices But, further to your Question - and further to my classification of this bunch of them as it seemed to me something stretching the laws of probability - consider this: I write that there is no way of testing how it seemed to me. I wrote that there was no repeatable experiment and no testable claim and therefore I had to resort to advancing it to someone else to see whether it seemed to them as it seemed to me. But, perhaps that in itself WAS the testing?! Perhaps that was the repeatable experiment!? I mean by that it was not just his reaction to the content of my independent material which counted. Quite unanticipatedly, he himself then became part of that very material! Didn\u00b4t he? In his having the strongest coincidence of his life whilst reading it and then us discovering four months later, that in a book which had been published a decade earlier HE is the first person mentioned in a section of it devoted to Coincidence and Synchronicity (!\u00bf?) Those wishing to seek beyond the opinion of my first reviewer/assessor will find two chapters of Professor Roderick Main\u00b4s 2007 work Revelations of Chance devoted to the same material - Synchronicity As Spiritual Experience (Suny Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology): Amazon.co.uk: Roderick Main: 9780791470244: Books ",

Well, there may or may not be, but repeated coincidences certainly do seem to invite further investigation and observation, perhaps leading to the formulation of a theory? Very many thanks again- every good wish, Barrie ",
