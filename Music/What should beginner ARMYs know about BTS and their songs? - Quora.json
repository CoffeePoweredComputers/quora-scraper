            "answer_text": "welcome to the fandom! :) here are some things to know about their songs. they have lots of different genres.don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t like some of the songs you hear. they have ALL KINDS of songs, from hip hop to edm to pop to rap to ballads, they\u2019re are a lot of styles to choose from.don\u2019t just listen to title tracks.title tracks are like the \u201clead songs\u201d of the album(s). for example, DNA, ON, and IDOL are some of their popular title tracks. imo, some of bts\u2019 best songs are their b-sides. b-sides are like the \u201cside songs\u201d that are not promoted as the head of the albums. 134340 and answer: love myself are two of my favorite songs of all time, and they are both b-sides.check out their solo songs.in every (not mini) album starting from their album \u201cwings,\u201d each member has a solo song where it\u2019s just them singing. some of the solos are written/composed by them too. they\u2019re all really good. personally i prefer jin and namjoon\u2019s solo songs, but you should check them out for sure. the solo songs kinda reflect on each of the members\u2019 personal music tastes.don\u2019t ignore their early songs.their early style was a very emo-hip hop vibe. you might think you don\u2019t like those kinds of songs, i did too, but after listening to \u201cdanger,\u201d i was sold. their older songs are really, really fun to listen to, you should check them out.learn to tell each of their voices apart. here\u2019s a quick guide:namjoon (rap)normally has the english rap parts.raps really fast.has a kind of boston-ish accent when speaking english.has a distinct voice.suga (rap)fastest rapper most of the time.sounds similar to j-hope but less energetic.almost like mumble rap.j-hope (rap, very occasionally does vocals)generally the slower rapper (not a bad thing).really energetic voice.kinda nasally voice.jin (vocal)very breathy (not in a bad way).really powerful, almost tight sounding high notes.has a silvery voice (idk what that even means but that\u2019s just how i feel lmao).sounds a little like jungkook, but you can tell them apart by the way they end phrases.jimin (vocal)really sweet, sugary voice.generally the highest pitched vocal.his voice is sort of feminine (not a bad thing).has a really distinct voice.v (vocal)deepest voice.really rich, creamy voice.has a large range, but is almost always the lowest pitched vocal.really distinct voice.jungkook (vocal, raps in some of bts\u2019 really early songs)breathy in his solo songs but very clear in group songs.he is also on the high pitched side.can hit every single high note ever.almost always has the most lines, or at least the most vocals.watch their music videos!a lot of their mv\u2019s are really deep, and make the songs even more enjoyable. here are some of their best music videos imo:blood sweat and tears (really deep and almost confusing, but super cool.)spring day (kinda depressing, but really meaningful. i\u2019d search up the meaning behind this one, because it\u2019s really powerful.)run (part of their BU storyline. a little graphic because there\u2019s a little bit of blood (i think there is.. i might be getting it mixed up with the highlight reel), but it\u2019s very good.)fake love (not a huge fan of the song itself, but the mv is very beautifully shot.)look into their song lyrics.bts is known for writing a lot of their own songs, and also for their lyrics. their lyrics are really powerful (well most of them are anyways). here are some of their songs with the most powerful lyrics imo:epiphany (solo song by jin)spring dayno more dream (their debut/first official song)jamais vu (jungkook, jin, j-hope)answer: love myselfhope this helps!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, a lot of guides out there will give you basic info on the members, but here\u2019s something the guides may not tell you: RM is the \u201cgod of destruction,\u201d and while he does break a lot of things, he\u2019s the glue that keeps BTS together. While his IQ is 148, he\u2019s a person that can make mistakes, he\u2019s human just like the rest of us :). His rap voice is powerful, and his lyrics are so skillfully written. Talent.Suga isn\u2019t just intimidating and \u201csavage\u201d. While he can be that way (and it can be really funny), he\u2019s also caring, warm, and soft sometimes. While he can be introverted and quiet, when the time is right he\u2019ll come out of his shell and just be a bursting ball of energy.J-hope, our sunshine. Yes he\u2019s our hope, our angel, and he\u2019s smiling more times than he\u2019s not. On screen. But remember that he is human too, he doesn\u2019t have to smile all the time. He\u2019s stuck with the burden of being the \u201chappy one\u201d even when he\u2019s not happy, and I hope he knows that it\u2019s ok not to be happy all the time. Anyway, he has a unique rap voice, and is a dance king.Jin, the oldest, is hilarious, I personally think his personality is under appreciated. His voice is beautiful and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s getting more lines than he used to have. He\u2019s improving so much, I\u2019m so proud of him. His laugh is contagious, his food is delicious (I know without even trying it), and he\u2019s worldwide handsome (and he lets everybody know).V. I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s become more quite lately and that\u2019s ok. It doesn\u2019t mean something is wrong, it just means that he\u2019s matured. A lot of people say that they miss his quirkiness, but honestly who says it\u2019s gone? He doesn\u2019t have to act a certain way. Anyway, his soulful voice makes you want to close your eyes and listen. He\u2019s the king of Gucci and has a cute dog named Yeontan.Jimin, our mochi. Mochi is a Japanese sticky rice cake and it\u2019s his nickname. Jimin is like\u2026the one that can recharge everyone with a hug. His laugh can cure your sadness. I don\u2019t know what else to say about him besides the fact that he\u2019s just amazing. (Even though it sounds like it, I promise he\u2019s not my bias lol). His voice is unique, and his style of dancing is sooooo good.Jungkook our baby maknae(youngest). He joined BTS at a young age and has been taken care of by the other members since then. He fights with Jin a lot (playfully), and joined because he saw RM rapping and was amazed by him. He's multitalented and is good at everything. His voice is beautiful, he can rap like nobody\u2019s business, and he\u2019s a great dancer.If you really want to get to know them, I would watch their reality show \u201cRun BTS\u201d even though there\u2019s over 100 episodes and counting, so it\u2019s a lot to catch up on. Even I\u2019m like 20 episodes behind because after episode 92 I stopped watching them every week. There are also a lot of content on YouTube, and they do livestreams sometimes on an app called V Live. Music: BTS\u2019 music has a variety of genres. Honestly, I suggest just listening to everything lmao. would start with either their recent album or Love Yourself: Answer, and then start from the beginning. I don\u2019t suggest starting from the beginning because it\u2019s\u2026just different I don\u2019t really know how else to explain it.Their music style has changed over the years(not saying that this is a bad or good thing), and you can tell just by listening to the title tracks from each era.There are some solo tracks, meaning that a member has their own song, and each rapper has their own mixtape(s).My favorite songs: Pied Piper (a really catchy song, I feel like almost anyone would like it)Just One DayHouse of CardsDon\u2019t Leave MeFake Love (my favorite title track)TearBest of MeSeesawMy TimeUGH!Hope that helps, sorry for the long post :).

            "answer_text": "Alright, let\u2019s get into it! The Group: BTS is a seven-member Korean idol group under BigHit entertainment. They started out as a Hip-Hop group, and branches out into other genres, such as R&B, EDM, and Pop. They\u2019re the highest-selling Korean act, with multiple albums surpassing 1,000,000 sales. Their latest album, Map of the Soul: 7 alone has over 5,000,000 sales. They\u2019ve sold out stadiums internationally such as MetLife in New Jersey, Rose Bowl in California, and Wembley in London. They debuted in 2013, when BigHit was a nearly broke company. BigHit was in this financial state due to multiple members of a past group, the girl group GLAM, getting in legal trouble such as blackmail. BTS remained the only group under the label until 2019 with the debut of Tomorrow X Together. The music: BTS\u2019 music spans nearly every genre, and is nearly all self-produced and written by members. Here is a genre breakdown: Hip-Hop: They have a vast expanse of songs in this genre, some typical, some atypical. Here\u2019s a few examples:We are Bulletproof pt. 2No More DreamCypher pt. 1, 2, 3, and 4UGH!00:00 (melodic, ballad hybrid?)Fake LoveOutro: HerOutro: TearAll Night (ft.

He\u2019s actually really sweet, in a similar way to Namjoon.Going off of this, he\u2019s also really supportive of the lgbtq+ community. He\u2019s even mentioned possibly being a part of it.

They show many misconceptions like Jin is eomma, Suga is arrogant and lazy etc. In my opinion new Army should watch more compilation and predict their personalities by themselves like I did and make their own opinion. Newer army should know that ships (for example- Namjin, Sope, Taekook, Jinkook) are for fun. And I will suggest stay away from ship videos for a while. I've saw some tweets that many of them used to hate Jimin as it (ship videos) shows him bad. BTS have shows like Run BTS, Bon Voyage Some documentries/ films- Burn the stage, Break the silence , Bring the soul Army can choose genre they want to listen then slowly and steadily discover whole discography I personally love MIKROKOSMOS, Magic shop, Love Maze, Spring day, Answer: love myself, So what alot They also release Japanese albums like recent one MOTS7: the journey.

Some people love it, some people hate it but that\u2019s who they are. They like incorporating new sounds that they haven\u2019t previously tried before. Personally I like this since it keeps us fans interested in what they will try next and makes things interesting, different from artists who are very true to only one genre or sound, their music evolves quickly. I love it because it keeps things exciting for us ARMYS. ",

They\u2019re humans - they have flaws, just like the rest of usAnd now some facts about songs: certain songs are far more sexual than they first let on (prime examples: Blanket Kick (also called Embarrassed); War of Hormone; Blood, Sweat and Tears; Miss Right)there are underrated songs that are so, so deserving of more love and recognition than they currently have (i.e. Beautiful, 95 Graduation, and Adult Child)members\u2019 solo tracks are still BTS tracks, so treat them that wayAnd I have one last message, just before I finish my answer: Whatever you do, do not become Oli London.
