            "answer_text": "There is definitely an art to this. I think Martin Turner\u2019s answer is good, but I\u2019ll try to add a little bit here. One way to not overpower the vocals is to not play over the vocals. IE, keep the fills and accompaniment to times the singer isn\u2019t singing. There is no reason a second guitarist has to be playing at all times! Second way not to overpower the vocals or first guitar is to keep VOLUME of the second guitarist reasonable. That\u2019s a question of mixing in the studio or live amplified performance. Second guitar can be meaningfully additive without being loud. In terms of what does a second guitarist actually do? -Play fills (mini lead parts) during times vocals drop out. -Double main guitar. Could be playing EXACT same thing, but a potentially more interesting thing is to play different voicings of the same chords. Could be open chords up the neck with a capo. Could be just treble chord inversions on the top three strings, only, etc. Its legit for the second guitarist to play extended chords that use extra notes from the vocal/melody line. For a single note line it make make sense to play a harmonized version of the other guitar\u2019s melody part. Both these things add depth and complexity. BTW, if you don\u2019t know music producer Rick Beato\u2019s music channel, its well worth checking it out. That guy is a trained jazz guitarist, and ex music-professor, and working producer with several decades experience, and he\u2019s a walking encyclopedia of music theory, music history, and insight. He recently did a \u201cwhat makes this song great\u201d video on \u201cIf you could read my mind\u201d by Gordon Lightfoot, and having watched it, I think its pretty topical to this question. That song in particular is really a great example of how a second guitar can add to the main part. Song, then Beato\u2019s explanatory video.  Beato going into depth here. You don\u2019t necessary have to grasp all the theory to get most of his points here about arrangement, etc:  ",

            "answer_text": "I guess the question is: why are there two guitarists? If one is playing lead, the other one can play a moving accompaniment.If you listen to the beginning of Layla then you hear a quite powerful moving part underneath the lead. Clapton clearly worked on this in the same way that he worked on the lead line.If one guitar is picking, the other can play a simplified version, Listen to the start of Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd.If one is riffing, the other can play the same riff, doubling it.The guitar parts are doubled left and right on many 1970s classic rock albumsIf one guitar is playing a riff, the other can punctuate it with a stab, as in The Song Remains the SamePage probably played both parts live, but it can make sense to split them.If one guitar is strumming, the other can do a light picked melody on topTangerine has this. You can listen to Led Zeppelin III for a lot of ideas about how to combine two acoustic guitars.You can have the second guitar hold a high pedal note while the other plays a solo, or even have two solo lines at the same time (so, a duet).Listen to the end of Comin' Home to hear both of these done with a total of three guitars.There\u2019s actually lots of things you can do, especially if one is an acoustic and the other electric, or one a 12 string and the other a six string. You can also play exactly the same notes, but in a different position, either playing barre chords or using a capo. ",
