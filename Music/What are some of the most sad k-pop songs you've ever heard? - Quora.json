            "answer_text": "Okay so I\u2019m going to list some songs and performances that make me cry about every single time  End of The Day by Jonghyun It took me a while to listen to this song again but then once I did I started tearing up. It\u2019s always been such an emotional and moving song but now it is has so much more of an impact on you.  Park Hyo Shin: Wildflower He isn\u2019t really a kpop idol but he is a Korean artist and whenever he sings this song he can\u2019t help but cry or tear up and me watching can\u2019t help tear up either. This performance with just piano and his voice completely live makes it seem so beautiful and raw. I listen to this song sometimes when I just need to relax and when I\u2019m stressed out about things it\u2019s a sad song but when I'm freaking out about school it really helps me.   Eunkwang: Letter From A Private Okay so this song is not really Eunkwangs it is just a cover but his performance makes me cry every freaking time. It was one of the last songs that he sang to melody at BtoB\u2019s last concert before he would go into the military. It\u2019s a song about going into the army and having to leave your family and how hard it will be and telling his friends to write him a letter and to not forget the happy days. He would be going into the military a week or so after and I probably cried the hardest during a song.  Falling Blossoms by Min Kyung Hoon and Kim Hee Chul I first clicked on this expecting a really goofy music video but then it was actually really emotional and I was not at all expecting it. That\u2019s probably why I started tearing up so much during this cause I was so caught off guard. The story is so freaking sad and I just can\u2019t watch it without crying still.  SNSD: Into The New World Ballad Version To be honest how could you watch this and not cry doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never seen them before you freaking cry your eyes out. They are all so amazing and you just remember how far they\u2019ve come and you immediately want to start crying. If you haven\u2019t seen any of these I do recommend it they are all amazing ",

            "answer_text": "These are the only ones I could think of at the top of my head: BTS- Spring Day This song is about losing a close friend. The instrumental and lyrics for this song really match well to this message they are conveying.  BTS- House of Cards A lot of people are taking this song the wrong away, but the lyrics really hit hard. It\u2019s about trying to save a failing relationship with a strong feeling of desperation.  BTS- Heartbeat This was the title track for their OST for their mobile game, BTS World. \u201cIn this track, BTS tell a story of not having met ARMY the way that they did in this universe. They first discuss what it would feel like if they hadn\u2019t met and formed the close relationships with ARMY (BTS' fan group) the way that they did. They describe the forms of negative emotions they would go through, such as feeling \u201cseasick\u201d or \u201clost at sea.\u201d Later on, they describe how they would miss or feel the need to be with ARMY, leading to the realization that it was ARMY who brought them out of confusion and made the connection.\u201d  It\u2019s a song dedicated to their fans. It really shows how much BTS care for ARMY and how \u201cseasick\u201d they would feel without us. BTS- I Need U Like House of Cards, there\u2019s a feeling of desperation, with frustration. The song is about being in a relationship with a girl and becoming ruined because of it. However, he can\u2019t bring himself to end this toxic relationship and begs the girl to do it for him. He is going through hell because of this relationship, but can\u2019t help coming back to it.  IU & Suga- Eight I felt like this song was dedicated to Sulli and Jonghyun (Rest in Peace, Angels). It just made me feel that way. Like Spring Day, it relates to losing a close friend.  Stray Kids- 19 This song is about the emotions a teenager has when coming into adulthood. The lyrics talk about feeling confusion in the new reality, the new responsibilities they have to face, and the fear of change.  Stray Kids- Hellevator Whenever I listen to this song, it brings me back to the days of the survival show :( This song is about depression, with the term \u201cHellevator\u201d meaning that they feel like they are falling down.  Stray Kids- Voices This song is about trying to shut out the negative thoughts in your mind, the voices in your head that terrorize your thoughts.  Stray Kids- Levanter This song is about trying to find your identity. These boys want to find out who they are, what their purpose is. They want to be themselves, but for some reason, they just can\u2019t. There\u2019s something holding them back and they don\u2019t know what it is.  Stray Kids- Neverending Story/Story that Won\u2019t End This was the group\u2019s OST for the K-Drama \u201cExtraordinary You\u201d. It\u2019s about a young couple seeing each other for the first time, how they felt when they did, the relationship that bloomed from there, and knowing they\u2019ve found \u201cthe one\u201d, they will stay by each other\u2019s side forever. It\u2019s a really beautiful song.  I.O.I- Downpour I think out of all of these songs I\u2019ve mentioned, its one really hits the most for me (Right next to Neverending Story). This was the last song released from I.O.I before they disbanded. It talks about losing close friends who they saw eliminated on Produce 101, the experiences and memories they\u2019ve been through as a project group, and the hope that they will come together again in the future. The music video is in a highlight reel fashion, using footage of them as trainees practicing in the Produce 101 training camp, performing for missions, group showcases, stages, earning their first win, recording their first song together in the studio, and, lastly, their emotions caught on camera when they found out they were selected to be in I.O.I. Combined with this ballad, it really leaves you tearing up a bit.  ",

            "answer_text": "**Sad gurl hours: open** Breathe by Lee Hi Although comforting by saying it's alrightAre just words  . . . Let Me Out by Jonghyun Someone please hold me, I\u2019m exhausted from this worldSomeone please wipe me, I\u2019m drenched with tears  . . . End of a Day by Jonghyun I can't cry all I want or even laugh all I wantAt the end of a tiring day but still, if I'm next to youLike a child, I can whine and then laugh till I run out of breathI'm not used to seeing myself like this  . . . Climax by IKON Before I left, I promisedyou as I held youI said I would build ahouse and wait for youYou should\u2019ve just aged butwhy did you age so beautifully?Not making me able to recognizeyou, my mischievous momI missed you like crazy  ^^I said it once, I\u2019ll say it again. This was a MASTERPIECE full of feels. I cried real hard watching this and fam, I don\u2019t cry easily. You could just feel the desperation and eagerness to debut. I don\u2019t stan iKON, but I do have so much respect for them after this performance. YG lost a great composer. . . . She\u2019s In the Rain by The Rose It\u2019s better to be held than holding on.  I love the progression of this song. At the beginning, we start with \u201cShe\u2019s in the rain\u201d but the song ends with \u201cWe\u2019re in the rain.\u201d Rather than just watching someone wallow through their sadness, offer a shoulder to lean on. . . . Humans by ZICO If my whole life ends todayWhich direction should I go towards?  A song that questions why humans are the way they are: from being young and hopeful as a child to being aged and crushed as an adult. It also asks the listener to be a little selfish at times; after all, it\u2019s your life first ;) . . . OUTRO: Tear by BTS rap line If someone said they would turn back the time for meWould I have been able to be a bit more honest?  It\u2019s an angry sad song, contemplating a previous love - the regrets, the sadness, etc. I think it hits extra hard after ep. 6 of Break the Silence, learning that Yoongi wrote it in light of BTS considering disbandment. . . . Stay With Me by Chanyeol and PUNCH I wanted to forgetAll the pain since we first metIf this isn\u2019t real, someone wake me from this dream, pleaseIs this destiny, are we really meant to be  I don\u2019t think this song is particularly I-wanna-cry sad, but it\u2019s very emotion-filled, nostalgic, and \u201cdesperate\u201d in the best way possible. . . . We Are Bulletproof: Eternal by BTS Throw stones at meWe don\u2019t fear anymoreWe are we are together, bulletproof   . . . Everyone Has by Chungha Without taking care of myself who's tiredAnd saying I'm fine, I don't want to say it anymore Even your comfortsAnd telling me to take a rest, I couldn't hear them  . . . LMM by HWASA Like the world is going to endThe sun setsInto the long darknessIt feels like we're going to get thrown away  . . . Eternally by TXT My heart sank into a maze of memoriesSave me  . . . Wow . . . I didn\u2019t realize how many sad songs I listened to until this - yikes :| Anyways, have a bowl of tears:  ",

            "answer_text": "I will approach emotional from a different angle. These are generally not slow songs, but they convey a deep set of emotions.  August D ft. Suran - So Far Away This song does have a hopeful feeling to it, but it sums up the hopelessness and \u201cpointlessness\u201d depressed people often feel.  August D - The Last He talks about his struggles and anxiety very openly, and how he managed to eventually rise above them.  Stray Kids - Voices This one of the best and most important SKZ songs, topic is self-doubt and depression.  iKON B.I - Mirror This is one of Hanbin\u2019s unreleased solos. It\u2019s very him. It has very simple lyrics that show how much he was struggling, and how lonely he was at times. \u201cFeeling frustrated but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the reasonIt feels dark no matter how hard I tried to open my eyes.\u201d  3RACHA - 42 This song is about suicide, struggles with identity etc.  iKON - I\u2019m OK One of the best breakup songs ever.  iKON - Climax Okay, a bit of background story here. iKON went through two different survival shows, Climax was their final song in the one they lost. As it shows in the video, they performed it so emotionally (especially B.I who had to lead iKON and produce music for them at the age of 17) that everyone was crying. I also included how 5 years later they were able to perform the song without the anger.   ",

I totally gotchu: \u2018I\u2019ll Smile Even If It Hurts\u2019 - Ladies Code Since Eshaan told me about this group, this was one of the first songs I fell across. This song is extremely emotional because it was their first release after their fellow members passed on in a horrible crash. Thinking about it makes me tear up. \u2018Eyes, Nose, Lips\u2019 - Taeyang The lyrics are so beautiful that just reading them makes you emotional. The vocals alone too. The meaning behind the song is absolutely heartbreaking but he\u2019s so real. The song is so personal too but absolutely gorgeous. \u2018Tiger Moth\u2019 - MONSTA X This is actually a k-drama OST (it\u2019s an amazing drama btw, seriously watch it) but it\u2019s so gorgeous. Even though it\u2019s almost rock, it\u2019s such a beautiful song (especially when you\u2019re watching the freaking drama). Their vocals bring so much beauty to this song (and the k-drama. okay, i\u2019ll shut up only if you watch it). \u2018Goodbye\u2019 - 2ne1 This is a no-brainer. I almost always cry when I watch the MV just because it\u2019s so sad knowing what happens. The song itself is super passionate and it\u2019s so heart-throbbing. \u2018Destiny\u2019 - MAMAMOO It\u2019s not the entire song that makes me emotional, it\u2019s just Solar\u2019s verse right before the chorus. If the entire song was like that, you best believe this song would make me bawl my eyes out. The meaning is also super sad but powerful. \u2018The Truth Untold\u2019 - BTS I\u2019m not explaining myself for this one. ~fm ",

It will brighten up your day. Also, their performance on the Golden Disk Awards being Jeonghan\u2019s first performance before he went on hiatus due to heath issues was really moving too.  Woozi riding the carousel and Hoshi and Wonwoo\u2019s reaction made me smile though.  Anyway, stan Seventeen for a better and more interesting life!

            "answer_text": "These are all solely based on my opinions. But these are some of the songs that hit me emotionally, as majority of them I can relate to. Loser - Big BangLoser talks about a struggle that many of us may have gone through. Being an outcast and not fitting in with the world. About how we can perceive a moment and what we may feel while in that situation, along the struggle of being able to redeem ourselves.  Eyes, Nose, Lips - TaeyangEyes, Nose, Lips talks about the hardships of going through, and the events that follow after a breakup. How much we miss that person, and long for them once more, but how our actions could have caused the conflict in the first place. It\u2019s really a heart breaking song, but also very relatable.  A Few Years Later - Block BThis song is somewhat similar to \u2018Eyes, Nose, Lips\u2019, as it also talks about the aftermath of separation. About how we miss someone so much and how we wish we could go back and change everything and start over, but eventually everything will fall back into place once again. Despite the pain we carry, the memories we can\u2019t erase, and what we learned from being in that situation.  Last Dance - Big BangThe way i perceive this song is that life flies by so fast, and it\u2019s also something that none of us expect. Like one day we can be surrounded by our friends laughing, and then they\u2019re gone and just a memory the next.  That XX - GDragonThis song is through the perspective of a person who is in a one sided love. That person loves someone deeply and would never hurt them and treat them right, but the other person simply doesn\u2019t see this, as they date a player who they are blindly in love with. Whereas the other person just wants his love to be seen by the other person, unsure of what he is doing wrong that the other can\u2019t see them.  Runaway - BOBBYThis song i believe that some adults can relate to, as it talks about the hardships of being held down by responsibilities, along with not being able to express yourself freely. Like wanting to pursue a dream, but are unable to because of everything.  Stay - BLACKPINKThis i believe talks again about possibly a one sided love, but about someone being in a relationship that is somewhat abusive. Loving someone so much despite the constant pain, but also eventually wanting to walk away and let go.  Of course there are many others that i haven\u2019t mentioned, but these are the ones that i could think of. And again, this is what i believe are some of the saddest songs, but there are many out there as well. Hope this helps in answering your question. (^w^) ",

Im Sejun & Jamie Jones - \ubbf8\uc18c \uc18d\uc5d0 \ube44\uce5c \uadf8\ub300 This is a (kind of random) cover of an older Korean ballad. The original song is very sad and a great song by itself, but this cover really sells it.  Ros\u00e9 (Blackpink) - \ub108\uc600\ub2e4\uba74 Again a cover of an existing song, but the way she sings it really sells it. The lyrics are very sad, as well. Feel free to use this cover as BP anti-fan repellant.  Day6 - You Were Beautiful Another case where the song isn\u2019t that sad-sounding, but the MV is a serious tear-jerker. Have tissues at the ready.  Hyukoh - \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc774\ubcc4 Cover of an older ballad. Less about the lyrics, but Hyukoh kills it.  ",

Last but not least, \u201cW\u201d by JYJ - due to the real and meaningful lyrics that were written for the remaining members of TVXQ, for in their hearts, they'll always be together, and they will meet somewhere. As a fan, the songs 2, 3 and 4 are really sad. Not just on that \u201caaaaw, that said\u201d-level, but on an intense level with much pain in the chest. You can't even cry anymore. It's just depressing. I still can't get over TVXQ and Girls' Generation. Such legendary groups. ",

It was pretty much Seventeen saying thanks to their fans and I cry every time I listen to the song or watch the music video because carats should be the ones saying thanks to Seventeen for being alive. Next is Downpour and I\u2019m sure that everyone knows why. The song and music video was so emotional and it was I.O.I\u2019s last song together before they disbanded. The music video even had memories from PD 101 season 1. These two songs have the saddest music videos/lyrics/messages in my opinion. ",
