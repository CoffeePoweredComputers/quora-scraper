            "answer_text": "This depends on how deep you want to go. To sing lyrics roughly, you can mimic, or you can combine what you think you hear with your guess at reading the romanized lyrics that are frequently available. For more accurate pronunciation, it would help to understand the Korean alphabet, its construction, and pronunciation rules. If you want to understand the lyrics, you might find translations, but it would help a lot if you understood the basics of how Korean grammar works, and know how to look up vocabulary in a dictionary or translation app. Over time, you will pick up bits of the language and culture and be able to get the gist of what songs you want to sing. Better vocalists will also modify their vowels and consonants for more resonant singing, so if you understand more about vocal tuning, this will close the gap a little for you on why things might sound slightly different from the pronunciation as it is written and normally spoken.

            "answer_text": "Actually, Korean songs are great material to learn Korean. Cause Korean songs usually include our natural words and sentences. And many Korean song doesn\u2019t include slang or swearing words. (Some have, especially in hiphop) If you see lyrics in Korean first, and then English second, and you can translate Korean lyrics to English lyrics. Or you just want to sing a Korean song, then first to do is \u201cLEARN HANGUL\u201d Hangul is an Korean alphabet. It has 19 consonants and 16 vowels.   So When you see \u201c\ud559\uad50\u201d, then you can find \u314e+\u314f+\u3131 and it sounds like [hak/hag] \u3131+\u315b sounds like [kyo/gyo] ",
