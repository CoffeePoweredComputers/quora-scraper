            "answer_text": "(I assume you are aware of paid services like iTunes and Amazon, and you are looking for something free - I am answering on that basis). Artists want to be paid. Copyright is how we pay artists. Of course you would rather pay less, or better still, not pay at all. The same applies to anything, clothing, cars, the latest MacBook. But that's not the deal. You will not die if you don't have access to the latest Taylor Swift album. Nothing bad will happen to you if you don't listen to it. If you don't want to pay the asking price, walk away from the deal.  Don't just take it - that's dishonest. ",

            "answer_text": "Internet Archive\u2019s Audio and MP3 is a site which \u201ccontains recordings ranging from alternative news programming, to Grateful Dead concerts to Old Time Radio shows, to book and poetry readings, to original music uploaded by our users.\u201d In essence, this site is a non-profit, online library, which allows artists to upload their music, as well as music-lovers to download anything from new music to poetry readings. The most popular feature, as mentioned previously, is the site\u2019s large archive of live music material. If you click the tab titled \u201cCollection,\u201d you can find some of the most popular live music collections SoundCloud. SoundCloud is a website that allows you to download music for free from both professional and independent musicians (it also features streaming.) Not all music can be downloaded on SoundCloud for free; some ask you to \u201clike\u201d the song through Facebook in order to get the download. However, the songs that can be downloaded for free have a \u201cDownload\u201d button below the specified track (if you have trouble downloading, it probably is because the site is working out some of the kinks; I recommend adding the track to your collection or playlist, then going back later to try and download it.) This is probably the most interactive site on this list. You can also share the track on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, Pinterest and email, as well as follow the bands you love to get updates on their latest, posted music. Besides following bands, you can also follow users as well. My favorite aspect of this site is being able to leave comments on specific tracks; to do this, you simply type in the comment box below the track at the point in the song where you want to leave the comment (you can also comment on other user\u2019s comments by clicking the avatar shown below the track.) SoundCloud also has a feature which allows you to use the site on your iPhone, iPad or Android; also it is a great place for up-and-coming artists to upload their music and gain more exposure and a bigger fanbase.
