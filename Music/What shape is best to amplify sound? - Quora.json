            "answer_text": "No shape can \u201camplify\u201d sound. Sound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source. If you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect. In reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a \u201cbeam\u201d of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction. Another aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it\u2019s coupled poorly to the air, it won\u2019t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not \u201camplify\u201d, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.
