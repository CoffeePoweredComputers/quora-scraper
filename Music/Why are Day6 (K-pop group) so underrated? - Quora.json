            "answer_text": "Alright speaking as a Myday, I believe that Day6 has themselves in this grey area of where they are recognized and people have heard their name before, but they don\u2019t have that much fans compared to other idol groups but at the same time, they also have more fans than some less popular idol groups and is definitely leading in the band industry. Therefore I mostly like to use the term \u201cunderappreciated\u201d with them rather than underrated. And\u2026 the reason why Day6 is not as known as idol groups is because, they are a band. \u2026.Which I guess is the main answer for this. It is true that bands in Korea do not get as much recognition as idol groups and especially if you compared Stray Kids\u2019(a JYP idol group that debuted in 2018) current fanbase size to Day6\u2019s (also from JYP who debuted in 2015), there\u2019s a huge huge difference. But this is where I bring back the topic of Day6\u2019s fanbase size being in that grey area. Just comparing Day6\u2019s social media following they currently have 964.5k followers on twitter and 1 million followers on instagram and I can probably name about several other kpop IDOL groups who have about only a quarter size of that following amount. But back to the topic of why Day6 is not as known, despite being from JYP, despite being from one of the Big 3 and despite having quite a large following on social media. It is HARD for bands to be as known as idol groups in Korea, and bands are well ya know BANDS, they aren\u2019t idol groups. The last time bands were as popular as some of the most known kpop groups were during the 2nd generation with bands such as FTIsland and CNBlue, until FNC messed up promotions with their bands and bands just kind of\u2026 faded away into the background (also with the factor of military service) and other more shining idol groups, especially the start of the 3rd Gen like Exo, started to dominate the kpop scene more, and eventually the current huge popularity of Kpop globally has just led people to just believe that Kpop is merely compormised of groups that wear flashy clothes and dance, sing and rap. (Hongki of FTIsland once said to Day6 during a radio show that the \u2018band generation\u2019 would rise again and tbh ? I\u2019m excited to see it happen again) Kbands are also usually compromised of older members (older i mean OLD) and less focused on visuals and do not have cool flashy choreography, and bands also usually do not follow the usual idol way of promotion such as many fandom related things like fanmeetings or even lightstick (in day6\u2019s case its a lightband) and etc., and those are the reason why Day6 is known/introduced as an \u201cidol band\u201d because they do all these things that other bands don\u2019t usually do, which is probably a benefit of JYP being a idol company rather than a band company. his said, they also tend to provide less \u201cfanservice\u201d. (A radio host who had met Day6 before commented that they seemed more like artists rather than idols) And I\u2019ve seen this multiple times, people not wanting to be a fan of Day6 because they find them boring for not having as flashy expensive looking outfits as idols or that they don\u2019t do choregraphy but just stands and play instruments (but honestly have you ever seen a Day6 concert? Day6 concerts are so legendary that multiple of people have commented that although they are a nonfan they want to experience a Day6 concert at least once in their life) There\u2019s also this thing about Day6 that I personally call the \u2018OST singer phenomenon\u2019 (there\u2019s not really such thing but I just like making names up lol). They have popular songs, super popular songs such as You Were Beautiful and Letting Go that are well known to the public (and even amongst other kpop idols) in Korea but it\u2019s those types of situations where it\u2019s kind of like \u201cOh i know/love this song!! But I don\u2019t know the singers\u2026\u201d (I believe this was in a reaction video by Koreans to the You Were Beautiful MV, where none of them knew who Day6 were but the moment the song started playing all of them immediately went \u201cOH I KNOW THIS SONG !!!!!!\u201d) or \u201cOh yeah I like those singers but I don\u2019t get as updated on them as I would an idol group, I still do watch out for new songs though!\u201d (You understand now why I called it OST singer phenomenon???) Initially, Day6 wanted to go through a normal band type of promotion compared to idols by not going to music shows and having limited variety show appearances. It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that kind of changed that and they started promoting on Music shows and having more variety shows appearances (tho god bless them theyre so painfully awkward when it comes to being in front of TV cameras). It took them 3 years to announce a fandom name when other idol groups would normally announce this during the first year of debut, and if I remember correctly their debut abum only sold 23 copies on the first day. (Though Studio J, the division in charge of Day6, really needs to step up the promotion game\u2026 variety shows are such a powerful way to get people to be more interested in a group and the members and I\u2019ve seen SO MANY PEOPLE asking about Day6 when someone posted the clip of Jae dancing to Dalla Dalla on twitter in the Youth VCR.) But Day6 is doing well, super well for a band (they\u2019re currently also kind of nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s representative band\u201d). There\u2019s so many things that makes them stand out from other groups and they managed to have a super successful world tour and encore concert that sold out at least 9k seats on both days. Also amount of shoutouts and recommendations from Stray Kids\u2019 Seungmin definitely causes a lot of people to want to know more about them lol. TLDR; While Day6 isn\u2019t super underrated anymore, they definitely deserve to get more recognition, appreciation and exposure. It\u2019s just that people tend to have a sort of tunnel vision when it comes to idol groups and kpop in general and Day6 being a band tends to not get people as interested. But in conclusion, stan Day6. (and sorry for the super long-winded answer!! I was writing this entire thing out while having a mild headache so the whole answer is kind of all over the place OTL, but i hope this is at least a bit helpful!) ",
