            "answer_text": "I think you're asking the wrong question\u2026 your instrument is gorgeous and I'm sure it gives you good feelings only by looking at it. I'm sure you've pondered for some time the pros and cons of purchasing it, looked for the right model, the right moment, the right price, the right shop. What I'm saying is YOU have established a relationship with your instrument, you know what it feels like holding it and playing it. Therefore, YOU should know what to call it (or even IF you should give it a name). Personally, when I assembled my own custom-made, one-off Frankenstein of a guitar in the guise of a Stratocaster, I knew right when I played the first note what its name was going to be, and for what reason. And so came the Patticaster (see pic).  ",
