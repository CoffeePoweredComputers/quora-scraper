            "answer_text": "There are different kinds of intelligence and \u201csmartness.\u201d Reading does several good things: It allows you to rapidly review and pick out information you want to learn more about.It then allows you to learn more, even in a fairly great degree of depth, about things that might otherwise take you months to learn in an educational program.It helps you pick up skills in determining what is true and what is false in the information you are being bombarded with every day through media that are all too often controlled by those with enough money to make their visuals more attractive and memorable. \u201cFlashy Pics\u201d does NOT equal \u201cgood information.\u201dIt helps you develop your own language and writing skills. You do NOT develop a high-level vocabulary through studying dictionary definitions. You develop it through reading millions of words in which you have seen less common words used repeatedly in different contexts by accomplished writers \u2014 and thereby gotten a real \u201cFEEL\u201d for how those words are properly used and what they really mean.It allows you to take FULL CONTROL over what you want to specialize your knowledge and skills around, rather than have to sit through a lot of peripheral material that may really have nothing to do with where you want to focus your attention and build your strength.It allows you to efficiently see and gain information and arguments that both SUPPORT your point of view on an issue and also QUESTION your point of view on that issue\u2026. so that ultimately you can be comfortable in knowing that you are \u201cright\u201d enough in your position that you can comfortably offer up your statements to the public while knowing you can competently defend against any attacks made upon them.READING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS YOU CAN HAVE! If you have children, one of the best things you can do for them is to teach them to enjoy reading. Let them see how you are able to tell them the stories they love because you are able to hold that magical thing called a book in your hands and turn the pages for the story while they sit in your lap. Show them how to recognize some simple words even if they don\u2019t know the alphabet yet. And once they DO start to read, make getting books for them a special present\u2026 something you get for them on a regular basis (e.g. My father always brought home a new \u201cTom Swift\u201d or \u201cHardy Boys\u201d book on his biweekly paydays and I\u2019d be waiting eagerly for it.) and something that becomes one of the most special treats with something big and unusual on holidays and birthdays. Heehee\u2026 Like most kids, I would wake up on Christmas morning as my parents were trying to catch up on the sleep they\u2019d missed due to shopping and wrapping and decorating over previous days. I\u2019d then try to wake them up so we could start unwrapping Santa\u2019s gifts. They had a solution for that: They\u2019d tell me that Santa probably left me one SPECIAL gift way out in front of all the others and that I could open that and play with it until they came down. That gift, of course, would be some big special book (E.G. a National Geographic Book Of Insects) that would occupy me happily for HOURS!) Ultimately all that early love of reading transformed into college and graduate school scholarships and my own love for writing my own articles and books about things that were important to me. So yes\u2026 reading WILL make you smart in ways that you would not have been otherwise! It\u2019s one of the best things you can do with your time before you hit your late teens and get all preoccupied with late-teen stuff! MJM, who actually has about 5,000 books in his home library \u2014 heh, admittedly many of them being sci-fi and vampire novels rather than special relativity tomes, but hey\u2026 they\u2019re still good books!",

            "answer_text": "Is reading books really makes you smart? Before getting into a proper response to answering your question, I like to share some broad perspectives about reading. A lot of folks think that they are smart after reading a lot of books. And they probably think you have a lot of \"knowledge\". I like to say unequivocally that they have only a lot of \"information\", and not \"knowledge\". To me, as I have responded to earlier questions on Quora, \"information\" is just an organised gathering or collection of facts that are conceptually coherent and personally relevant to oneself. A post or a book or a magazine article or even a news broadcast that one has just read and/or heard and understood, is \"information\". \"Information\" becomes useful as soon as you can see through it, from the standpoint of a specific pattern of relationship, or \"connecting the dots\" as Steve Jobs so eloquently put it for us, to come up with an \"idea\" i.e. the creative process, of using it to create a productive outcome or a concrete deliverable in your life, in your work, in your business, or even for your client(s). That's to say, there has to be a personal relevancy to action, in order to determine the usefulness or viability of \"information\". Upon putting the \"idea\" to work, then only one gets to know whether the \"idea\" has worked, or didn't work. Better still, one may even get to know what might help to make it work better, faster, or even smarter, the next time round. This is then aptly called, \"experience\". Over time, cumulative \"experience\" then becomes \"knowledge\". Putting this initiative in another way, reading a series of posts or books or magazine articles or even listening to a news broadcast, is \"information\", or what I like to call \"word experience\". Through execution and implementation with all the sweat equity, and not forgetting adapting and evolving in different application contexts through time, only then, one gets \"knowledge\", or what I like to call \"world experience\". The Smartest Person of the 20th Century Albert Einstein is believed to have said: \"Knowledge is experience; everything else is just information!\u201d Think about it. The Internet is invariably packed with lots of \"information\" (Sad to say, with all the Good, the Bad and the Ugly). A lot of folks always think that by just googling, they have lots of \"knowledge\". To sum up my point, \"knowledge\" is not measured by what's stored in the head; it's what you do and what you don't. That's to say, your ultimate productivity matters the most! OK, now, back to your question: As long as you have made full use of your evolving knowledge from reading to create productive outcomes or construct concrete deliverables that eventually could add/compound/multiply value to your life, say as a student, or to your work, or to your business, or even to your client(s), as a professional, you have become a lot smarter than those who don't.

            "answer_text": "The people who are saying \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnot really\u201d have never read anything outside of fiction. Yes, books will make you smart, very smart. They are, quite simply, a key to intelligence. They offer far more (valuable) information than what any video on Youtube, Khan Academy, or anywhere else has to offer. Take someone who learns a subject over the internet versus someone who learns from books, and the books person always wins by a long shot. Books have been and still are the elite form of education, mainly because of the quality of the content contained within them. However, it depends on what you read and how you apply it. Being intelligent isn\u2019t just knowing stuff. As Einstein once said, \u201cAny fool can know. The point is to understand.\u201d The \u201cunderstand\u201d part is very important. There is no point to knowing stuff if you can\u2019t or don\u2019 t know how to use what you know. It would be like an artist learning everything there is to know about drawing but never actually draws anything in their life. Simply reading books is not enough. Intelligence is represented in terms of information. There is information in books, but there is also a load of information that is obtained from physical experience, information that would be way too dense to just fit into a book and expect readers to remember. It\u2019s for this reason that intelligence is not limited in its definition. You can be intelligent in dancing, making music, drawing, writing stories, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Whatever you decide to learn, make sure you do your due diligence in selecting your book first. Don\u2019t rush it and also, try to avoid the \u201cmost popular book\u201d. The most popular books are often the most generic books, which means you\u2019ll get generic perspectives. Instead, find influential figures in your field and see if they wrote any books. Often times they are more difficult reads, but very rewarding. The logic here is simple: If you have an option to learn from a master, don\u2019t just settle with someone that is good or great. ",

What\u2019s the most common thing in ultra successful people? Reading books! Now comes the real question. Does reading make you a smarter person? Right?  Bill GatesThe man who unleashed Microsoft onto the world, Bill Gates reads 50 books a year. The result? He is currently second wealthiest person in the world with 97.4 Billion US$.  2. Warren Buffet Warren Buffet claims to read 500 pages a day. He stated that he devotes about 80% of his time to reading. Perhaps it isn\u2019t a coincidence that he\u2019s one of the richest men in the\u2078 world.  3. Mark Cuban Mark cuban, another successful billionaire reads 3 hours a day, that adds up to about 1000 hours a year. Say the average book takes 5 hour to read, that means cuban is reading 200 books per year.  4. Elon Musk When tech billionaire Elon Musk is asked, How he learned to build rockets? He reportedly answers \u201c I read books\u201d  5. Oprah Winfrey Media mogul Oprah Winfrey selects a book every month for readers to discuss online as part of \u201cOprah\u2019s Book Club 2.0\u201d  6. Zig Zaglar The Motivational speaker Zig Zaglar claimed to read 3 hours a day, despite his tight schedule.  7. Brandon Carter The internet celebrity of massive muscular proportions says, \u201cI read 2 hours everyday. This habit is responsible for the majority of my success.\u201d  8. Tim Ferris The New York Time best selling author of 4 hour work week Tim Ferris says that he reads 3 to 4 books a week. That adds up to 150 to 200 books a year.  9. Tony Robbins As a young boy I decided I was going to read a book a day. I didn\u2019t quite read a book a day but over seven years I did read more than 700 books.  10. Benjamin Franklin From a child I was fond of reading and all the little money that come into my hands was ever laid out in books.  So what\u2019s the conclusion? That\u2019s the Power of Reading. Leaders are readers. Knowledge is Power. I bought the speed reading course of Jim kwik known as greatest brain coach on the planet. You should have to follow him on Instagram & Listen his podcast. What he said is damn true, In 21st century \u201cKnowledge is power, Reading is superpower\u201d \u201cReading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.\u201d Thank you for reading. Ping me anytime for book recommendation \u2705 Have a good day.  Image source : Google Cheers & Peace \u2665\ufe0f ||SD|| ",

            "answer_text": "Reading teaches you to absorb information quickly - the better you can read, the less effort your brain uses to process language, leaving more brain power to deal with the meaning rather than the language syntax and grammar. A lot of people love to read fiction - I think this is more about entertainment than any intellectual growth. At some point all fiction deals with the same old human interactions - in fact there are just a few archetypal plots that cover 90% of stories.  Science fiction does introduce some things to think about - but many science fiction writers just take a regular old fantasy story and rename stuff based on scientific terms. Disc world, Hunger Games and so on fall in this genre. On the whole - fiction is like eating only candy - it makes you feel good, but it\u2019s not challenging your ability to think abstractly - also experiencing emotion tends to lower your power to think - so a book that makes you feel typically dumbs you down. Reading non-fiction is useful - one kind of nonfiction is informational books - one has to be careful when choosing books that talk about facts. Some fields of knowledge have no facts, rather only speculation - Self help books lie in this category - they present some hypothesis, but give no real evidence or a line of reasoning that can follow. \u201cLaw of attraction\u201d, \u201cSun signs\u201d and so on fall in this genre - they just fill your head with some notions that have no basis and cannot ever stand up to scientific scrutiny. Another non-fiction genre is the textbook - this is full of fact, but tends to focus on memorization rather than abstraction. Reading these kinds of books too much (as you do in college) your brain ends up like this:  The next genre is popular science - Many authors like Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins, Michio Kaku, Harari, Taleb have become popular. The ones who write about physics sometimes tend to oversimplify things. But they remain mostly accurate.The books that deal with subjects that are not very rigorous tend to push a certain agendas or theories without emphasizing the speculatory and hypothetical nature of the book. Another genre is the philosophical book - this includes books dealing with human nature as well as books dealing with abstract philosophy.Once again, many authors often try to push ideas rather than present them as hypotheticals. Books on socialism are often like this. Ultimately books are like food - they contain memes just like food contains bacteria - some memes help you survive, but some memes survive at your expense. One has to have a balanced diet - build a strong immune system against memes, and examine them critically before infusing them into your brain. Facts are very useful memes - facts never mutate, and can be regenerated from scratch. Ideologies, stories, fantasy and philosophy are useful for survival, but there ate plenty of harmful or wasteful ones too. The conclusion is that reading fills your brain with stuff, but it is not guaranteed that it always makes you smarter. If you want to grow muscle, you need to eat a lot - but that doesn\u2019t mean eating will make you more muscular.It depends on how you process that food. Same for books - it\u2019s not only about quantity, or even quality of the material you read, but also how your brain deals with the ideas and memes in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Do books make you smarter? I\u2019m really not sure they do, in and of themselves. When I was in 8th grade, in the late \u201870\u2019s, we had a quiet \u201creading period,\u201d sponsored by the parent-teacher association (PTA), every afternoon. At that time it didn\u2019t matter what we read, all that mattered was that we were reading. At home, much to my mother\u2019s chagrin, I was a bookworm. But I never brought my personal books to school, so, during the daily reading hour, I was forced to choose something to read from the cardboard box at the front of the room. I can still see that box, covered loosely with hideously bright floral wrapping paper, so appropriate to what it held. I\u2019m guessing the PTA donated their cast-off paperbacks and magazines in order to make their program successful, because half of what that florid box contained were Harlequin Presents Romances. (The other half of the box was filled with old sports and fashion magazines so, naturally, I chose the books with the swooning lovers on the cover). If you\u2019re not familiar with Harlequin Romances they are, or at least they were at that time, formulaic romance stories focusing on a heroine who is frequently drawn to a mysterious man with whom she falls hopelessly and shallowly in love at some weekend spent at a fairy tale country manor or estate. Another way of describing them would be \u201cPG-13 bodice rippers.\u201d I\u2019d never encountered books like these before. Or since. I clearly remember being critical of the terrible writing, plots, and the flagrant stupidity of the cast of unbelievable characters. Did those books make me smarter? I doubt it. Garbage in, garbage out. Of course the experience did give me some insight into the reading habits of the average PTA mom, so on that level, maybe the books made me smarter. Or, sadly, a little biased. In any case, I chose not to join the PTA when I had the opportunity, some 20 years later.  ",

            "answer_text": "On average,they do. But that solely depends on your choice of literature. Good books are the ones that help you with your personal growth,teach you something whether it\u2019s a life long lesson or better vocabulary. Good books are a miniature universe on their own.Once you start reading them,you become a part of the plot. Isn\u2019t it amazing that you are reading a person\u2019s thoughts and life experiences who lives,perhaps,thousands of miles away and which you\u2019re never going to meet in person? But virtually,not only have you met them but have also become a part of their incredible circle of learners. Such books are not necessarily massive scientific journals. They could be entire bundles of fiction and essay analysis but if you are in the correct mindset,you become a better human after reading them. Bad literature is what I like to say,an increase in carbon footprint and a waste of space. I have read terrible literature. In the writer\u2019s community,it is considered a good thing to read the \u2018not-so-good narratives\u2019 and use them as templates as to how to not write a book. Erotic literature has sales higher than ever.Massively stupid trilogies are ever so popular but people still spend their time and energy flippping through the leaflets whether it is a learning experience or not. In the olden times,the purpose of reading books was not to become smarter but they were read for the sake of learning because there were no other knowledge gateways. In the modern times,those who read books are deemed smarter because it is viewed as the classic form of learning. Consider it yourself. Who appears more scholarly :- One who reads from a kindle or one who is devoted to a leather bound volume? People now willingly force themselves to set goals for reading actual books for the sake of becoming smarter. So from a standard viewpoint,we can safely conclude that books (good or bad) do make you smarter but only if you read them with the correct mindset and intentions. ",

            "answer_text": "Infinitely smarter. OK, I know some people are going to point out that it has little effect on your IQ score, once you've grown up, anyway. Fluid intelligence, which is what an IQ test tries to measures, doesn't increase with age -- in fact, once we're past 14, it starts to decline. But most of what we consider smartness isn't what we figure out for yourselves. It's what other people have figured out for us. That knowledge, and the skills we learn and practice, are called crystallized intelligence. Even an Einstein doesn't figure most things out -- if he did, he'd be a very advanced caveman! Well, not even that, because the caveman benefited from the geniuses who invented flint knives, clothing, and controlled fire, not to mention some heavy-duty hunting and gathering techniques without which one would rapidly starve. Crystallized intelligence, unlike fluid intelligence, increases as we get older. And while we can get some superficial information from TV or YouTube or just talking to people, real understanding still requires that we read, not just online, but books. I don't think you have to become a bookworm to be knowledgeable -- or even that that's desirable -- but you do need to read the central books in your field, and also the most important general books -- the classics and books that come along, a few a year, that have a major influence on our culture. Back when I was working, I'd read technical papers, data books, manuals, patents, and textbooks. And then when a problem came up or someone needed to know how to do something, I'd have the answer and everyone would say \"How did you know that?\" and call me a genius. And meanwhile, I was thinking \"But it's only because I read the manual,\" LOL, Once you have knowledge, both general and specific, you'll find yourself understanding much more, able to do much more, and being tapped as a resource by people who will then consider you really, really smart.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really care to elaborate that much because the answer should be pretty obvious that it\u2019s BOTH. However, I read a LOT. But I read in spurts. That is, sometimes I\u2019ll read 8 hours per day for weeks at a time. I usually read all kinds of topics too, from medical science, to philosophy, economics, physics, occasionally some fiction and self-help stuff as well. Other times, I will get trapped into a video game or other hobbies that are less intellectually stimulating. My personal anecdote reveals that when I am in a state of constant reading, I tend to be more productive at work and quite sharp, being able to relate a lot of things to what I have been reading about. I make more progress on personal projects and I seem to reflect better internally when I think about things. To understand why reading can actually make you smarter, it requires some level of understanding about neuroscience. Your brain is nothing but a big recording device that responds to the environment. Genes merely modulate how exactly your brain responds to each stimuli. Reading books, encountering all these bits of data and insight can physically (literally) reshape and restructure your brain, which is ultimately what determines someone\u2019s \u201cintelligence\u201d. Of course, people who are smart are also more likely to read. It\u2019s a positive feedback loop! Side note: Reading ITSELF has some affect on brain structure (like exercise has on muscles), but the content of the material is probably more important. It must actually provide useful knowledge, items of insight, etc. Sort of like training your muscles to do a specific task rather than to just be \u201cstrong\u201d. You must also actively apply your new knowledge and insight, otherwise it just fades away, again like unused muscle lol. Thanks for reading my view and opinion on this subject. :) Studies and references can easily be supplied upon request. ",

            "answer_text": "Smarter? Maybe not but it defenitly gives you a new perspective. You've probably heard the saying \u201cinspiration can strike from anywhere\", what this means is the more you read and the more you widen your reading selection, you get fresh percepctives. Let's try to see it as an example, Say you read Issac Assimovs Robot series  This is a science fiction book where the author imagines a future with robots almost reaching a sentient state(singularity), how the rules of robotics might be and how it would effect humanity. You might start thinking about how a robot would think if it were very intelligent and start to dwell on similar subjects like AI. Next you read a book about finance  This book talks about various aspects of stock market the basics and some tips for getting started in stock market investment. At first glance these don't seem to convey more than they intend to but take a step back and look at it together and you get a plethora of ideas. For example you could think of the potential application of AI in finance and how it might help analyse portfolios, inverse it and you might be able to come up with an actual estimation of the money required to come up with the best robots and see where it can be optimized. True genius lies in application and forming connection where it isn't obvious, that is how people like Elon musk make a difference apart from there passion it's the perception. Hope this motivates you to read and read voraciously. Peace ",

            "answer_text": "I won't bore you by telling Bill Gates used to read. Jack Ma used to read Jk Rowling had a library at his home Zuckerberg was born in a library. (Pun) The point is, Reading makes you an aware person. And an aware person has all the potential to be a smart guy. You see the smartest men on earth aren't divine beings. I am of opinion that they are just aware beings. Self aware, socially aware, mentally and emotionally aware and most important of all they are aware about how to deal with consequential stuffs. A person who is self aware knows how he fits into and how he can take control of various situations revolving around his individuality. A person mentally and emotionally aware can very easily figure out red flags of his personality and work on it. Similarly a person socially and politically aware understands how to give back and get the most out of his soroundings. He understands the better route that has to be taken to bring out the best case scenario. A perception is built into him that makes him look at things and events as it should be. And it is precisely these factors that maketh a successful man/woman out of a fellow human. Unlike much of TV and Social Media, books aren't dismissed as merely entertainment. Books are made to provoke thinking and ofcourse along with some entertainment and fantasy. Books are written to conect and experience what the author is trying to tell. When you don't read, you dont do much of the thinking. This is a straight up simple fact. And needless to say no person male or female has been able to add value without giving anything a proper thought.  Big things start small.  Tells you, you got one life. Try\u2026try making it as better as possible.  Shows you glimpses of life under holocaust and how to find motivation at the darkest of times.  Belief, can move elephants.  And change destiny.  How good leadership turns to fascism and conservatism. These are some of the book I have read/re-read this year so far. So how do you plan to understand all these nuances of life without reading? Sorry, but electronics media can't do justice at this level or depth. Needless to say reading gives you an amazing vocabulary that's downright sexy and a variety of topics to discuss on with anyone. Also imagine a good looking girl reading a book, that you just have finished! Damn!There's a ready made well served ice breaker. So read as much you can. Stay informed, aware and ready. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes, but you can learn faster when you be like Da Vinci and focus on these techniques. Let me elaborate. There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when shown, and those that do not see. - Leonardo Da Vinci No doubt. I am a big fan of the great thinkers. My top thinker of all time? It has to be Da Vinci. Why you ask? For his abilities in learning and creativity, without a doubt. A mathematician. A scientist. An engineer. An anatomist. A creative and learner. Always learning and creating. Do you see? Maybe the lessons from Da Vinci will help. So what would be the lessons in learning and creativity derived from Da Vinci? Here are the ones I continually come back to: Sketching and note taking Over his lifetime Da Vinci created 13,000 pages of sketches and notes. 13,000 pages. By hand, on individual sheets of paper. A sketch in the center, simple and done quickly, label on top, annotations along the sides, arrows pointing to key content. Sometimes a short summary on the bottom. Divergent thinking first Alone for the first few iterations divergent thinking. Time to generate lots of ideas, and to reflect. Incubate ideas. Ask himself lots of questions. Always observing and studying. Think about the age of Da Vinci \u2026 no computers, few books, and few experts in fields of his interests. Just his ability to see and observe using notes to record for further study. Convergent thinking later Da Vinci often reviewed his work with respected peers after he had finished incubating his ideas. It was an opportunity to refine his ideas. Time to collaborate. He was way ahead of his time in most topics, so many of his good ideas were rejected. He didn\u2019t lose his desire or his persistence by the rejections. But remember \u2026 13,000 sketches led to at least 3 masterpieces. Persistence is a key, isn\u2019t it? Perhaps this is the most important reason we have less creative people. Save and revisit later Most of Da Vinci\u2019s sketches were done on individual sheets of paper. Not in a constrained notebook. He understood the value of multiple revisits and connecting, reconnecting, and grouping related facts and observations. An analogy expert. And an uncanny ability to connect several different observations and ideas to create new ideas. You should know these: Top Notch Educated Person ... 12 Traits You Will Recognize Defer judgment His basis of study was simple observation and notes/questions on his observations. He withheld judgments, either positive or negative, for as long as possible. Particularly his own. He appreciated that judgment would be a block to creativity and new ideas. \u201cThe greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions\u201d Curiosity and questions Perhaps Da Vinci\u2019s greatest asset was his insatiable curiosity. The more observations and connection of ideas, the more questions and curiosity. And creative ideas. Stimulate imagination Da Vinci used divergent thinking to create lots of ideas. Lots of ideas, questions, and curiosity to stimulate his imagination. He minimized the limitations and constraints when using his imagination to think of the solution space to his many questions. Do you see? Very, very few of Da Vinci\u2019s abilities are in the populace. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn to be creative \u2026 it can be learned. Can you use these lessons to learn to see or see better? Give it a try. Practice and be persistent. Stick with it and over the long haul you will see some good dividends.

            "answer_text": "NO! Lemme explain. The first thing is many people here are attributing different things to reading, like having more vocabulary, knowing more about the world, etc. But you don't get that from reading, you get that from learning. And you can learn many different ways, not just by reading. So people shouldn't boast that they read many books. someone can watch a lot of tv and have the same knowledge. Think about it. Lemme tell you something. In school, some people had to read a lot of books to know stuff and get good grades. I got good grades just from listening in class. .But wait, there's more! Having more knowledge doesn't really make you smarter. EEspecially (yes, I said it with two E) if people have too much trust on their knowledge, which is a very dumb thing to do. When I was little, like 6 years old, I once was talking with my friend and I said that I thought lightning could break rocks. But he just went out telling others that lightning breaks rock. And actually, the same thing happens a lot with science. They suggest something and you see people certifying it as fact. The smartest scientists are always reminding others that you can never be too certain of anything. The less smart people are constantly forgetting it. .Now, you know what will make you smarter? Puzzles, and conversations, and experience. And analyzing things. And the more variety, the better. Recently, I started learning capoeira, and I find it to be a great physical and mental challenge.

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say for sure that reading makes people smarter, but it does improve your brain in one way or another. I recently read an article from Book Riot listing down what improves in your brain when you read: crystallised intelligence (which refers to the hard facts you know), fluid intelligence (how you solve problems, detect patterns, and how you understand and summarise crystallised intelligence), emotional intelligence (your empathy), and your brain connectivity.  When you read, you will acquire crystallised intelligence\u2014or factual knowledge. These are the figures, data, and facts you pick up from textbooks, encyclopaedias, and other similar resources. The more you read, the more you will add to your bank of information. When you read, you improve your fluid intelligence as well. Readers develop the ability to spot patterns and establish connections quickly since they repeatedly need to understand what they read; consequently, reading hones their analytical and critical skills. Reading also improves one\u2019s communication skills. When you read, you expose yourself to different words and different expressions. Reading teaches you how to use these words and expressions more correctly and more effectively. It also boosts your memory; when you read, you\u2019re actually training your brain to retain the ideas you\u2019re picking up. Third, reading improves your emotional intelligence, too. There\u2019s actually a study by two psychologists in 2013 that revealed that people who read fiction identified other people\u2019s emotions better than those who don\u2019t. The study also revealed that this is because \u201cthe same psychological processes are used to navigate fiction and real relationships.\u201d Lastly, reading increases your brain connectivity. There\u2019s a study conducted at Emory University that discovered that reading also engages with the part of the brain that handles movement and sensation, aside from the portions that handle language. After having the participants read the novel Pompeii by Robert Harris, the researchers discovered that their brain\u2019s language centre as well as the part that handles movement and physical feelings remained enhanced. Now that you\u2019ve started, why don\u2019t you go further and jump into these awesome reads?

            "answer_text": "Yes most definitely. Keep in mind that I use a broader definition of smart than pure intelligence. I define smart as being effective in achieving your goals in a given environment.  Environments could run the gamut from arguing a point in class or work, managing a team to deliver a software product, solve math problems in grad school, or play a symphony.  As an added dimension, there is smart in a narrow context versus smart in a wide variety of situations or even novel situations. Ultimately it comes down to effectiveness. You could be a 12 year old with an IQ of 160, and, while yes you may be brilliant, I probably wouldn't want you working on my software product.  A lot of the problems we face are termed \"wicked problems.\" They have no clear solution, have a multitude of pros and cons, and affect a myriad of stakeholders all of whom may each have a different perspective. With such problems, no one person can have all the answers, rather different perspectives and insights need to be generated, combined, and implemented in order to come up with a workable solution.   I'd argue that most important problems that an organization, a community, or a nation faces are wicked problems. Thus this brings us to smartness. To be effective in such situations requires a broad swath of knowledge and the ability to quickly understand and integrate different perspectives. It requires a certain agility to link up diverse concepts from different fields and see parallels.  And how do you do this?  By reading a wide variety of hard materials and an in-depth study of a variety of fields. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. TV and social media (not Quora!) \u201cdumb you down,\u201d because they require so little attention and are not truly stimulating your mind. I think reading is one of the only cures. Reading\u2014especially nonfiction\u2014can teach you about topics that never occurred to you and expand your innate intelligence. You may not think like a scientist, but read some bio-psych and your brain can open up to embrace different pathways that are natural to the author. A lot of fiction is art. Art can cleanse the soul and offer you great beauty and escape. The most striking advantage of reading is exposure to WORDS. You can vastly improve your writing and speaking abilities\u2014not by just becoming more informed or interesting\u2014but by increasing your vocabulary. Many words I wouldn\u2019t know if I had not learned them through reading. You may have to look them up for pronunciation! I don\u2019t read enough, but I do try to read every night before sleeping\u2014just to clean my brain out, interrupt my anxious thoughts, and to set my subconscious free to dream up what I have to do the next day. I don\u2019t really understand this magic trick reading plays on consciousness, but I have faith and just believe. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading will not change your innate intelligence. Intelligence is related to the amount of gray matter in certain areas of the brain. That\u2019s a matter of genetics and nurture as a baby and child, when your brain is physically growing. Human Intelligence Determined By Volume And Location Of Gray Matter Tissue In Brain Reading anything will make you more knowledgeable. Reading somethings will make you more knowledgeable than reading other things. Reading people Magazine isn\u2019t going to have the same effect as reading Orwell or well written non fiction. Though Though there is nothing wrong with reading some garbage on occasion, I do. I also like watching some TV sometimes. You will gain vocabulary and an understanding of the meanings of words by reading. Sometimes word meanings are slightly nuanced and if you just study them in isolation, you end up miss using them or using them in a way that comes off awkwardly. You may be intelligent if you do that, but people won\u2019t see you as intelligent. They see you as pompous, verbose, or just plain full of yourself. Reading nonfiction will make you more knowledgeable about the subjects you may be intelligent if you do that, but people won\u2019t see you as intelligent. They see you as pompous, verbose, or just plain full of yourself you read about. If you\u2019re reading nonfiction about history, you\u2019ll be knowledgeable about that, but you may not be knowledgeable about other non-fiction topics, for example, science. If I you\u2019re reading fiction, you will become more knowledgeable about that genre. I\u2019ve read all of John Steinbeck\u2018s works. I\u2019m knowledgeable about his writing. Good fiction can give you an understanding of the human experience, something that nonfiction may or may not be able to do.A book about wild birds in a certain geographical area will not give you insight into the human experience. A book about sociology might, but it would be specific to the nonfiction topic it covers. Pick up a book, any book, and read it. It\u2019s better than reading Quora answers. It\u2019s definitely better than watching TV or a Vlog. Regardless of what you read, you\u2019ll be smarter than if you don\u2019t read at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily, but it certainly makes you more knowledgeable than the person who doesn\u2019t read! Reading only makes you smarter if you absorb what you read and then utilise it. There is an old saying that Knowledge is Power, but it really isn\u2019t. the real power comes from applied knowledge! This means that you can be as knowledgeable as you can be, but if you never put that knowledge to any use, if your life and skills are not really enhanced by it, you would be no more smarter or capable, despite what you might know. Again, our chosen books tell a lot about us, often revealing far more about our passions in life that we might openly admit. For example, if you are not reading anything it says volumes about your own desire to self-educate, to learn, and to raise your development standards. Reading books is a sign of being alive, of being intelligent and being curious. Thus an absence of books would say more about you in a social gathering than whatever you actually say. Even if you do not become any smarter, reading is more likely to do the following for you: Improves and widens your vocabulary. You will learn far more words, and gain great expressive fluency, through the information relating to places, things, people, and ideas.Widens your experience of your world. Books are very informative, and offer a opportunities to escape to unknown places, sharing unknown cultures, and experiencing new sensations. The imagination can work very powerfully with a good book.Improves your personal expression. Reading regularly will improve your own expression and the choices you have in expressing yourself to whatever audience is necessary. It is also likely to give you greater confidence in dealing with others.Appreciates other viewpoints, because reading exposes us to a wider variety of ideas and contexts.Gives you something to share with others. Reading gives us shared experiences with which we can make friends, build friendships, develop interests and have common points of conversation and discussions.Increases your chances of success. \"Leaders are readers\", as one writer said, which makes reading essential to achievement, especially relating to elements that are of relevance to your goals, vision and purpose. The more you read, the more your knowledge will grow, the more you will be exposed to similar and alternate views, the more you will identify allies and rivals, opportunities and possibilities. Furthermore, as you read, the more confident you will feel in achieving your aims through increased knowledge of how to bring them to life.In a nutshell, books can make you smarter, but there is no guarantee of that. It all depends on how you utilise what you read. However, one thing is certain: without constant reading you cannot build your vocabulary, you are dependent upon old and outdated knowledge to guide you, and you will be limited in your thoughts and intellect. In short, not reading very much turns us into fossils being left behind by the rushing tide of time, events, new expressions, and new innovations.  ",

            "answer_text": "Reading is the most important skill you can have. More important than IQ. More important than math. There is simply no faster way to learn something. I love Khan Academy, but I have no patience for videos. Raising the speed doesn\u2019t help me. Lectures don\u2019t help me. I learn the same way I learn everything and that is reading. I got into speed reading (basically reading with your eyes, and not subvocalizing) when I was studying for the SAT. It changed everything. There\u2019s always some argument about how increasing speed means you decrease comprehension. Well then read slower. But over time you will improve. It just happens. It is inevitable. I teach it to all of my students because critical reading passages are on every standardized test and reading is something you simply cannot escape in life. Fortunately, now, we have resources like spreeder. Considering the fact that I read nonstop from when I wake to when I sleep and have been for the better half of my life, I used spreeder to clock my reading speed. I can do it in front of anyone. I have them pick some random passage and copy and paste it into spreeder, I set the chunk size to 6 words, and I have the speed 5000 wpm. Yes, I can read that. I can spot typo\u2019s on pages faster than anyone I know. I read automatically. It\u2019s always on. And yes, you can read that fast too. \u2014 My study method for example the MCAT, involves me using a minimum of three different prep books from different companies, and an open window for google image search. I read from all of these sources as I take my notes. I prefer to take my time to absorb the information. But I\u2019ve had times where I procrastinated so much I\u2019d read 600 pages of a not too dense textbook and score pretty well on an exam. \u2014 This is a top speed. I don\u2019t read everything this fast. For instance, novels I like to subvocalize and take my time. Honestly, stop following all of the quora shit on IQ\u2019s. I\u2019ve just stopped following that stuff myself. Nothing is as important as reading. ",

Smart is just another synonym for intelligent. Your intelligence is mostly based on your health, and your genetics. People tend to mis-correlate high intelligence with high levels of knowledge. Being noticeably knowledgable in a subject will make people assume that you are very intelligent. But this is a false assumption.  There are plenty of people with average intelligences that are more knowledgable in subjects than people with superior IQ's. I am an intelligent person, but I know nothing about being an accountant-- If you make me and an accountant with an average IQ take the same test on finance, that accountant is going to kick my butt at that test. Not because they are smarter, but because they know more.  That being said, reading will make you less ignorant, and if you are already intelligent you will have more information at hand to utilize at your leisure. It's also a lot easier to draw more insightful conclusions when you have more information.  Reading more will provide you with tools that will be invaluable regardless of intelligence, but it will also amplify your ability to apply your pre-established intelligence.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well that depends. It certainly can expand ones knowledge in new areas. Reading the classics like Dostoevsky, Camus etc also have incredible wisdom and life advice. However reading something like Thus Spake Zarathustra will not bring you new knowledge in the same way that reading an algebra text book will. Most philosophy books are quite difficult so to really gain knowledge the best way I've found is this formula Read a brief synopsis of the book so you understand what is the message this person is trying to convey.Read the book once through all the way, do it section by section and after each section write a brief outline of what the key message is. While reading it highlight the things you don't understand or that don't make sense in one color, and the things that do make sense and that you think are important in another color. Try to read it through very naturally though, don't like take notes on each bit.Then go over what you've written down and use the help of a professor or the internet etc to try and clarify what you know and don't know. This means finding the best possible explanation of the book, Stanford philosophy is a great resource. Make sure you Vet your source and don't rely on a random internet person or even quora unless it's an expert who answers.Re-read the book, and this time do a comprehensive write up of each section etc. the write up should be done with the idea that your teaching this material to someone else, so write it out as if your about to give a lecture to a 101 class on this book. This will be very time consuming and could take weeks if you are reading it in your spare time.Finally put everything else away and just read the book in a very natural way as if it was a fiction novel. When reading take the point of view that \"this is a human being trying to communicate a message about life to another human being.\" Since this is sort of vague/high-level it helps you not get bogged down by details or confusing sentences.Then lastly use whatever resources you can to clarify what the book is about. If there is any remaining issue.If you do this while reading Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Hegel, Nietzsche, Descartes, Aquinas, Kierkegaard, Sartre, etc you'll be in great shape. (The above list is ONLY WESTERN PHILOSOPHERS, that means anything frkm Asia, Africa, Asia Minor etc is not included, and there are some incredible philosophers who should be included during your reading, however it is sometimes easier to start with western philosophers as they are more relatable and the translations of their work is more fluid.)

Arun : But, i don\u2019t remember a word from the first book i read. Guru : You do. Arun : How? I don\u2019t understand. Guru : Okay. Go and fill a glass half with sand. Arun went and filled the glass with sand. He came back and gave the glass to his Guru. Guru: Now pour the water up to the brim of the glass Arun did as his guru said. After filling water he gave the glass to his guru. Guru just put the glass upside down. A good amount of sand got removed with water. Arun : Guru, what did you do ? Guru : See Arun, the sand in the glass represents the bad/dirty things in your mind and the water in the glass represents the knowledge. If you read book regularly then you can clean your mind regularly otherwise one day you are going to be just sand and dirt. Reading doesn\u2019t make you a smarter person but it helps you understand life better . ",

            "answer_text": "I think reading is one of the more productive activities you can do. By reading anything, even mass-produced fantasy or crime books, you`re cultivating an ability to concentrate over extended periods of time. Having this ability is becoming ever rarer in a world of vines, on-demand news, clickbaits, memes and listed entries (Here are 10 methods to learn ANY language in just one month, etc..).There is a quote that stuck with me from the movie/book Fight Club, I transcribe: \u201cwhen people think you`re dying they really listen to you, instead of just waiting for their turn to speak\u201d. As the author of many books on how to \u201cwin friends\u201d, Carnegie noted that the most used word in the average phone conversation was \u201cI\u201d. The point of both these quotes is to illustrate that all of us are the main person in the world in our own minds. When you`re reading a book, you`re really getting into the mind and perspective of another person. For as long as it takes to read the book, you`re in someone else`s shoes. If you read War and Peace you will get a better understanding of the russian mentality, if you read Lolita you might find yourself sympathizing with a pedophile, if you read The Great Gatsby you`ll get an idea of the decadence of rich-people life in the 20s.. and so on. You`ll realize there are almost endless amounts of cultures, societies and mentalities out there, and for every book you read you`ll be able to understand just a bit more the complex layers of meaning around you.Whatever you read you`re expanding your vocabulary, and for every new word you learn, there is a new way of expressing a thought or arguing a point. Being the owner of a large vocabulary means you will find it easier to use the written word to your advantage, and you won`t be as afraid to start the process of writing. This is important in many respects. Just think how nice it would be to always have well-written resumes, job applications, invitations, letters and speeches.",

            "answer_text": "The Major Intellectual Benefits of Reading All these years, the world has been abuzz with plenty of reasons as to why it is essential for people to develop and maintain a healthy habit of reading. But how does it exactly benefit the human mind? It expands your vocabulary. Reading does significantly expand your vocabulary in ways that you may not notice right away. It exposes you to and lets you uncover the context of the words that you\u2019ve probably never heard of before. Reading compels you to look up the meaning of the words you\u2019ve just read, hence as you go further along, the more the sentences make sense to you than before you began reading them. It improves your communication skills. This goes hand in hand with vocabulary: the more you read, the more words you have available in your frame of reference to use in everyday conversations. Reading teaches you new words and new ways to use the words more correctly when constructing sentences in your mind. It develops your analytical skills. A research conducted by Dr. Anne E. Cunningham, professor of psychology in the University of Berkeley in California, shows that readers are seen to have a greater general knowledge and are able to spot patterns a lot quicker. The more patterns you spot, the more developed your analytical skills become. It is an effective memory booster. Reading and memory are two interrelated concepts. When you read, you are more of training your brain to retain the ideas and words you are reading, which eventually helps boost your memory.  ",

            "answer_text": "Indeed! It was my personal experience! Not just smarter, it makes you wiser :) It\u2019s all started after I finished my school education and entering my freshmen year. There were myriad friends for me. Especially, I never have felt alone. The kind of support and warmth, you get from your friends has no words to describe. We fight, we make fun, we make memories together! Those years were both fun and beaming. But these relationship didn\u2019t last long. In fact, it was fake! All those bliss and memories and fun and every shitty thing I had with them became fake! I started to see their true colours. I was broken and depressed. I became all alone and my mind became indolent to normalcy. This is where my life showed me a true and trustworthy friend! The BOOK During my first encounter with the books, it\u2019s Shiv khera\u2019s You too can win. After reading few pages of it, I started to gravitate towards the pages of it and kept my full attention until I completed the whole book. Wow! What a book?! It\u2019s the exactly right medicine for my pain and depression. I\u2019ve found it. This book showed me that life can be changed and designed as to our desire. He wrote the book in such a way that anyone can keep the routine provided in it.  Then I came across the book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, this book showed me how a single thought can change one\u2019s life in a mysterious fashion. From this book, I started to keep a perfect mindset so to achieve my deepest desires so far I have. What you can conceive in your mind, you will receive is the main adage. I\u2019ve started to invest a part of my time to reflect upon myself. So that if any negative thoughts I keep on, will get disposed off from my mind.  I can keep on telling so many books I\u2019ve read and my experiences with it. Especially fiction! It\u2019s a must read for everyone. It makes you an empath! I\u2019ve recently read a fiction called Blackfish City. Such an emotional journey in which the parted family gets reunited. The author sculptured each character\u2019s emotions as words in a very beautiful way. Wow! Such a tasteful book I\u2019ve read! Before reading book, I was: Short temperedLazyNegative mindedFearedStumbled to speak proper EnglishHad Social anxietyAfter reading books, I\u2019m: ConfidentKeeps smilingFocus on my goalDisciplinedStarted to see the big picture of everythingPositiveAll these such attributes, just can\u2019t come just like that if you just take a book and read. You need to get the depth of the book properly especially if its\u2019 a non-fiction. Many of us, read the book and just jump to the next book. No, it\u2019s not like that. You\u2019ll need to practice what is preached in the book. Sometimes, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t do that thing. It\u2019s because you can\u2019t able to leave your comfort zone. Even it happened to me, as I had a very difficult time to overcome my depression and overthinking negative thoughts. You just need to keep on practising until you get the desired result. Even I took a year to change my habits and myself. So, don\u2019t just give up! Life is too fun! Read books and have multiple worlds to swallow :) ",

            "answer_text": "In one word, YES! Reading can make you a smarter person, but it entirely depends on what you are reading. If you are reading a book that can teach you something, then yes you will definitely become a smarter person. Let me explain. Connect the dots When you read, you start to form connections in the back of your brain. I like to call this \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d. When you read something, you get ideas. The more you read, the more ideas you get. These ideas can be some tips or entire concepts. When you start connecting those ideas together (just like connecting two dots with a line), you start understanding things better. You start to see things differently. You see and understand the big picture. This helps you become a much wiser and smarter person. Broaden your perspective or mind When you read books in various categories, you start to see things from different point of views. The more you understand these viewpoints, the better you see things that others miss out, and the smarter you get. Grow your knowledge Reading books provides you with huge amount of knowledge. Knowledge that not only makes you look smarter, but when put to good use will help you live the life of your dreams. Unlimited potential Reading is the best habit there is.

            "answer_text": "Reading allows you to incorporate information and experience (whether fictional or real) that you would not have had if you had never opened any book.  It allows you access to the minds of others from distant times and places.  It teaches you that this modern world was not always here, and that people thought in other ways.  It places you in a situation of danger and allows you to practice what reactions you might have were you in that character's place, encourages you to pit your mind against the detective to solve the mystery, see what it takes to be an astronaut, learn how devastating the Civil War was, or how wonderful it was to be present at the founding of our country, to ponder thoughts from philosophers to janitors about ultimate issues of life, death, God, and evil.  A book is not only the best time machine, but also the best movie theater (your mind produces better special effects than any CGI).  The richness that reading adds to life is indispensable.   TV is inferior for two reasons:  you are seeing on the TV screen something that the director sees and formulates for you.  And what you see is inherently deceptive, because you believe the images you see (\"seeing is believing,\" after all!  Isn't it?  Not necessarily.)  A television program is expensive to produce, and fewer people can get one produced and shown. Sure, it's fun, and more gratifying immediately, but reading is ultimately more powerful because it allows you to use your mind rather than passively accepting the products of someone else's mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading has these benefits: First thing: reading doesn't make you smart. It makes you wise. When you read, you are deciphering the meaning/interpretation of every word, which means you are making an effort to get a grip on something. And when you make an effort, the outcome of that effort stays with you forever. When you read, you are opening up your mind to opinions. When you open up, it means your mind has more space and hence more power to process. Reading teaches you how language can be used to convey feelings/expressions/convictions. To read is to access someone else's mind. You can understand the inclinations of a person through his/her writings. Reading increases patience. Because it takes time to understand anything in life. Unlike writing, reading can't be copied. Reading is the only proof that you are literate. Helping others to read is the only proof that you're educated and useful.Reading is the only way through which you can read this.",

            "answer_text": "To really answer this question let's define the two things that we are trying to equate. Smartness. Smart can mean anything from well-dressed to street-savvy. For this discussion we can limit its scope to \"wiser than earlier\", which makes it a personal growth journey. (Worth pursuing).'Reading' - So the question is - reading what? Let's classify reading sources in general and their ability to influence the \u2018Smartness\u2019 that we chose in (1).Here are the different things we generally tend to read and how I think they fare in achieving (1).Non-fiction: Genuine Experiences of remarkable people who are humble enough to tell them as close to the truth as they can. (These are immensely useful. Some great reads I found are: Barefoot Coach by Paddy Upton, Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama, Surely You're Joking My Feynman, The Stories of My Experiments with Truth by MK Gandhi, Open by Andre Agassi)(Humble) Smartness tip: Make your own notes on these and use those as guides.Non-fiction: Newspaper stories which are presented as non-fiction but we don't know the motivations and internal biases of the people writing them. Sometimes the shroud of this is more dangerous than openly dishonest autobiographies.Smartness tip: Take them as wonderful hypotheses and to better your skills of weaning out good sources from the bad. Over time once you have established your own sources you trust, these can be used as great sources of general knowledge and awareness of the world around you.Non-fiction: Ideas that are derived from people's, experiments, theories and so on. These make for great reading but you need to think about them exactly for what they are - ideas and not always truths. Smartness tip: Use these for trying out things for yourself and see what works for you.Non-fiction: Compilations of deep research of measurable and factually verifiable phenomenon. These, especially when well-narrated can really help you not just know interesting things but to also remember them. Smartness tip: Might want to read these multiple times!  (Some great reads in this category: Sapiens, A Short History of Nearly Everything, Genome, The Emperor of All MaladiesFiction - Well written, great language (any language)These are like music to the mind. They tease your imagination and spread pixie dust on the daily grind of life. \"Oh the places you will go!\" like one wonderful book title says, is true with these. Classics even act as passive teachers, you will find that if you read things that are well-written, what you write will also subtly get better. They give you a portkey that you can lose yourself into. Great reads: So many but try to explore great writers from your own language as well. Smart Tip: At Choose To Thinq we try to read random things without thinking too much. Really helps staying curious.Enjoy the journey!",

A person who has a high IQ but plays video games all day is not going to be effective at much of anything other than winning video games. By contrast a person with lower basic intelligence who reads a lot may well hone skills that are useful in a wide variety of arenas. Reading can provide you with information that you can\u2019t easily acquire from direct experience, and probably helps to create greater emotional intelligence. Reading also helps us become better writers and to express ourselves more clearly and cogently. Your basic IQ is important. Very smart people can do things that those with lower IQs cannot. But at the end of the day you have to work with what you have, and in most areas of life it\u2019s how you use your native intelligence that\u2019s crucial. For that reading can be important, indeed essential. ",

            "answer_text": "I must not say that reading makes you smarter in every way but I must say this that it makes you smarter in some specific ways. When it comes to crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence, emotional intelligence and brain connectivity, reading certainly plays an important role. Now, let me explain all these four things separately :- Crystallized Intelligence:- It's all about factual informations and knowledge that a person posses. And I feel that reading certainly enhances one\u2019s information base.Fluid Intelligence:- It involves problem solving abilities, pattern detection ability and ability to understand things in totality.Emotional Intelligence:- It's a person's ability to understand what others think and feel.Brain Connectivity:- It is the ability of brain to associate different facets in order to feel more human.Now coming to the question whether reading makes smart or not?. Since, now we know that reading enhancing ones ability in terms of crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence, emotional intelligence and brain connectivity. Let me discuss all these outcomes of reading individually, which may give is some clue about whether reading making us intelligent and smart or dumb. Crystallized intelligence, means informations and data, I really don't think that a person who has more information and data is smart, so for me a person who poses crystallized intelligence is not necessarily smart. Reading and fluid intelligence have a reciprocal relationship; reading trains people\u2019s brains to better detect more meaningful patterns and as people make these connections, they better understand what they read. What's the conclusion here is, you have to be smart enough to understand the things which creates difference. people who read fiction are significantly better at identifying other people\u2019s emotions because \u201cthe same psychological processes are used to navigate fiction and real relationships. Therefore, fictional studies will make people more human means in my opinion more smart. Since I have discussed about the outcomes of reading and after analysing all these outcomes one by one, it must be said that one can not define a person's smartness on the basis of how diverse his or her reading is?. Then suddenly my mind asked, so what makes a person smart then ?. What SMART exactly stands for?, I will call a person smart if he has patience, delligence, and determination, because you will be called smart only when you have achieved something significant. And we all know that Reading requires all three. That means, you can develop all those qualities which required to be successful while reading. Therefore, there is no doubt that reading books make people smart. Jai Hind ",

Please do one thing, think of the one person you know either be in any category, search on the internet. Try not to find their relation with books. How much they are obsessed? It\u2019s hard to find. More the stories,ideas,fiction, non-fiction,biography, philosophy, science you read more you be the wise person, less you be in the brawl with other. Smart is not the right fit for that, So, I claim wiser. More you read, more you be wise and generate a wit. Here, is more list I prepared for you. Reading a lot, gives you sense of the paradigm shift.You try to observe from others perception.You don\u2019t want to debate with other.You don\u2019t feel alone ever.You look more sensible while talking.You are more aware of repercussions.You may developed a proper sense of your life.(it depends)The way you look the world is not judgemental.Free from social grudges.Feel the world in your palm.There were lots of such list which depends on the person\u2018s receiver so I won\u2019t waste your time.

With a doleful expression, in a sporty-tailored classic jacket, at once switching to a goofy gracious stifle, mitigating the mundane composure, with a heavy heart\u2026 I've only read books like Vengeance (Israeli revenge), Mossad (Thrilling operations) and others of same genre and nothing else the so called \u201cliterature garbage\u201d. I don't want to read ten lines describing how a shit-f*cked person looks. I've no interest in the co-ordinates of the mole near his d*ck and its distance form his b*lls. I've consumed a lot of Hollywood TV series and movies just simply because I can't read. I want dialogues. And I get a hell lot of in Banshee, Suits and all. Here, I don't have to go through three pages describing how aromatic and soothing a dog-sh*t is. I don't want to drown into the beauty of literature of four paragraphs dedication to description of a f*cking plastic chair. If you want to be smart, do what fascinates you. Read what thrills you. Don't listen to people. They'll name those clich\u00e9 novels only. Watch some great TV series, a rhythmic flow of dialogues, play of wit and no description of someone's sh*t. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence\u2014 what it is, and what it isn\u2019t\u2014 is actually one of my favorite topics. So I may go on a bit. Intelligence, for starters, is a baseline thing. Though it shouldn\u2019t be oversimplified, it\u2019s definitely still a baseline thing. What you\u2019re born with, you\u2019re born with. It can be diminished in any number of ways, such as trauma or substance abuse or, really, even just a horrible life as a child. And only very rarely, such as in the case of Daniel Tammet, is it likely to improve. It\u2019s analogous to the spending limit a bank places on your credit card. You can only spend what you\u2019ve been predetermined to have. Where the cheese starts sliding off the cracker on this, is our tendency to fail to note that there are many different kinds of intelligence. If someone writes well, or perhaps performs maths well, they tend to get ranked as intelligent. But the guy out on the green? or on the basketball court? He tends to have his unique form of intelligence overlooked. In actuality, there\u2019s a specific kind of intelligence known as kinesthetics which makes his ability what it is. He\u2019s not just faster or stronger than his mates, though obviously that helps. The team athlete is at all times bombarded with the need to make quick decisions on the move. And those decisions invariably involve navigating in and through other things (and people) which, like him, are in motion. In a nutshell, if he\u2019s good, he\u2019s outsmarting everybody. Science has nailed down at least eleven distinct forms of intelligence. Musicality is another one. You\u2019re born with it or you\u2019re not. And even if you\u2019ve got it, well, how much of it? And that\u2019s where things get interesting. Each form of intelligence comes in all sizes. Some people can carry a tune, but not much more. Others can write symphonies. Some can keep a beat. Or someone like Phil Collins can sing one rhythmic line while pounding out an entirely different one with his hands and his feet. At the end of it all, this makes each individual remarkably unique. Each person is likely to have any number of the different kinds of intelligence. Let\u2019s say I have five of them\u2014 a, b, c, d, and e. But let\u2019s say someone else has the same five. Are we the same? No to the no. On scales one to ten, my five might rank 7, 4, 6, 8, 3. His might rank 5, 9, 9, 1, 5. Same intelligences, but a completely different landscape, even if we ignore the inevitable decimal places. It\u2019s this blending of the different kinds of intelligence, all depending on their levels, which makes each of us so unlike each other. It is human nature to compare ourselves to each other, and to try to figure how we size up. Plus we live in a world that pushes us pretty hard in that direction. I encourage people to recognize that their value isn\u2019t to be based on where they rank as, say, a wordsmith or a number cruncher. Our value, I believe, is something more of a fingerprint. I know before I open my mouth that the person I\u2019m talking to is literally unlike anyone else. I\u2019ve done the math. The number of possible configurations far outpaces the number of people on the planet, or even the number it could hold. So, to the question. Does reading make us more intelligent? Much depends on who\u2019s doing the reading and, in truth, what they\u2019re reading. But if growth occurs, is it really \u201cintelligence\u201d that\u2019s growing? No. Knowledge may grow. But so may delusion. If one digests what is factual and true, knowledge legitimately grows. If one digests what it false, though does not see it as false, knowledge diminishes. Yet knowledge, is utterly key to the development of wisdom. Reading can play a role in that. Or it can play a role in making us just the opposite of wise. We\u2019ll know more words. We\u2019ll perhaps become better at putting a strong sentence together. So on the face of things, as far as anyone can tell at a glance, we\u2019ve become \u201csmarter.\u201d And by smarter, yes, we mean more able, which not at all is the same as more intelligent. But if our becoming stronger is not also our becoming wiser, we\u2019re kidding not only the observer but even ourselves. Reading comes with no such assurances. Those assurances have to come from an entirely different place. Intelligence is a big deal. Heart is a bigger one. The heart is the neck that turns the head. What do you read and why? ",

In my point of view, reading plays an important role in improving any person\u2019s intellect. Various researches have shown that the more one reads, the easier it is to make a quick judgment. So in short, reading does make you a smarter person. Let us have a quick sneak peek at some of the major benefits of reading. 1. It Increases Your Ability to Focus Effective reading demands a user\u2019s focus and attention. So if one is actually reading then there are great chances that the same person can read under difficult circumstances. 2. Reading Increase Memory Capacity I have often seen that the more I read, the more I am able to memorize facts and figures that were read years ago as well. People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Elon Musk all read hundreds of books every year. 3. It increases your vocabulary and communication power The more you read, the more you get an expert in using a variety of words for a circumstance. It not only increases one\u2019s ability to pull new words every time but also augments a person in effectively communicating. 4. Reading Increases Decision Making Power Various researches have shown that reading makes one a quick decision-maker. The better one is at decision making, the faster he/she will proceed to success. In all, reading helps an individual to grow and make better decisions. As the CEO of a company, I read more than 50 books every year and the results are upfront.

Throughout most of my childhood, I was not allowed to watch tv, play video/computer games, or have playdates. Pretty much all of my time outside of school was spent reading. It was like that for me all the way until high school. Now, I\u2019m a bit smarter than my peers. I\u2019m also more creative, handier, and better at writing and proofreading. All of this because I went through books like they were water, starting with one each week in kindergarten, and getting to the point where, in 7th grade, I could read 7 books in a single weekend. In short, if you read enough, you will become smarter. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer must be carefully addressed, because in one scenario, what you use as \u201ceducational books\u201d may not be the best books to \u201ceducate\u201d yourself with. You will find it difficult to educate yourself with books that are largely rhetorical. Neither will reading novels \u201ceducate\u201d you as well as nonfiction books will \u201ceducate\u201d you. As a general answer, it is true that \u201creading enough educational books\u201d can offer you the knowledge you seek. However, it is also a fact that you could read many books over a period of many years and do little more than study things that completely confuse you. This is entirely possible because there is an abundance of books that qualify as \u201ceducational books\u201d which are published every year, and it constitutes a body of literature which is not very helpful at all. Some \u201ceducational books\u201d will make you smarter and some will not, and that is why the question must be answered carefully. Also to be taken into consideration is your reading ability, your reading vocabulary, your awareness of an Academic Vocabulary and the Academic Word List and your familiarity with Stative Verbs and their Noun Forms or the Stative Nouns and their Verb Forms. \u201cStative Verbs\u201d are verbs which correspond with expressing feelings and ideas (Mental Actions). \u201cStative Nouns\u201d are nouns which correspond with feelings and ideas (Mental Objects). There is a culture war in full swing and in the culture war it is often the strategy of some \u201ceducational books\u201d and their authors to encourage the use of Physical Verbs and Physical Nouns and to discourage the use of Mental Verbs and Mental Nouns. However, if you want to avoid the mental manipulation in those books, you will need to develop a knowledge of Mental Verbs (Stative Verbs) and Mental Nouns (Stative Nouns) which are called Nominalizations. You will not be actually \u201csmart\u201d until you can write sentences which use an Academic Vocabulary. I can show you a kind of \u201cshortcut\u201d and the short cut is something you can print out as a guide for some of your study. It is called a \u201cCommon Book\u201d or a \u201cCommonplace Book\u201d. It contains some basic information regarding educational subjects for study. Here is where you will find that on www.Quora.com: Bruce R. Bain's answer to Is one textbook per topic enough? As you learn things which are \u201ceducational\u201d you should write it in a notebook and begin making your own \u201cCommon Book\u201d.  So far, what I suggest for you still offers you a broad spectrum of possibilities. Try as I might to narrow your \u201ceducational\u201d reading to something manageable, there is so much \u201ceducational\u201d to know that you can easily feel discouraged and depressed. Therefore, I suggest that you focus on developing an Academic Vocabulary, because that will give you the power to understand \u201ceducational books\u201d and will also give you the power to write about \u201ceducational\u201d subjects. So I suggest you educate yourself about the English Language, and particularly the language that goes beyond the vocabulary associated with fiction books. (This does not mean you should not read fiction books for fun. You certainly should read for fun, but you should prepare yourself to communicate in what is called the real world.)

            "answer_text": "Alright, I see elements in your question that require attention: 1. reading 2. make 3. intelligent. Reading is a means of acquiring information. So, are you asking about reading specifically or about information in general? Because someone can be a genius without reading a book his entire life, if he listens to that information, or learns it through experience, or has it downloaded to his brain through some futuristic device we are yet to invent. Regardless of the means, information is what intelligence uses as material, without information there is no process to manipulate that information. It just can\u2019t exist one without the other.Make - it is known already, intelligence is stable across life, generally. It changes very slowly, and only in one direction - down. As we age, we are getting more stupid, i.e. we lose capability to learn and to adapt as we get older, but we compensate that by becoming more experienced and more educated. It\u2019s like solving same problem several times, at some point you will do it a lot more efficiently than someone smarter that does it first time. Reading books, or, becoming more experienced, won\u2019t make you smarter, but it can definitely help become wiser.Intelligent? do you mean the actual intelligence? the capacity to solve problems and to learn fast and to adapt and to understand complex ideas? Or do you mean educated? These are different things. Intelligence is what helps someone be efficient at tackling new information, new environment, but if one lives in a stable environment, he can invest some time in adapting, and become competent in whatever he does there, as long as things are repetitive enough(not dynamic).So, the key word is competence. Whatever is your intellect now, it will never go up, so don\u2019t think about it too much. Just find your spot in this life, become competent and educated in that field of yours, and you will be more efficient than smart people that are just passing by(with some exceptions of course), so as long as you will be useful to your community in that way, you\u2019ll have at least one extra good thing in your life.",

It is the same as the pupil, in learning to write, following with his pen the lines that have been penciled by the teacher. Accordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part, done for us. This is why we are consciously relieved when we turn to reading after being occupied with our own thoughts. But, in reading, our head is, however, really only the arena of some one else\u2019s thoughts. And so it happens that the person who reads a great deal \u2014 that is to say, almost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in thoughtless diversion, gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who is always riding at last forgets how to walk. Such, however, is the case with many men of learning: they have read themselves stupid. For to read in every spare moment, and to read constantly, is more paralyzing to the mind than constant manual work, which, at any rate, allows one to follow one\u2019s own thoughts.\u201d -Schopenhauer ",

Nearly 1200 years ago, Japanese swords reached a level of perfection on par with today\u2019s most advanced steel manufacture. Interestingly enough, people at the time hadn\u2019t the slightest idea about the science of steel; they had no tools or concept for measuring carbon content and their method of determining proper metal temperatures involved comparing the sword\u2019s glowing metal to that of the early morning sun. Not so long ago, knowledge wasn\u2019t captured in the form of written words, but passed by word of mouth, tradition, ceremony, master to apprentice and other such inaccessible means. Books and indeed the written word (with varying degrees of success) are somewhat permanent and immutable records which can contain access to vast worlds of knowledge far beyond the consumption capacity of a single person.

            "answer_text": "Well, that largely depends on what you mean by \u201csmarter\u201d. Reading books does not increase your IQ (as someone noted in an earlier answer there is no real known way to do that). Although, ones IQ is really only a small piece of a much larger puzzle. It does increase ones knowledge and brain power though. Many people have noted that it depends on what you read. That is certainly true. Books that really make you think, or challenge what you think you know are going to have a greater impact than books that do not. However, I would argue that HOW you read is equally as important (irrespective of WHAT you are actually reading). Even reading \u201ctrashy\u201d novels can be done critically, which will provide you a greater benefit than simply reading a quality book more passively. Ask yourself questions as you read. Do you agree with what the protagonist did? What do you think was the motivation of the antagonist? Was there a better option that could have been chosen? Why did the author choose this path? How would I react in this situation? How does this jive with my understanding of the world? Why do I feel the way I do about this character? Engaging with books in this manner is going to bring out far more benefit than simply reading a book, and will increase your ability to think and reason, which I think are a much better measure of \u201csmartness\u201d than simple IQ.

            "answer_text": "Tl;dr: No To give a comprehensive answer, I would like to go in depth. Reading books alone won\u2019t make a person smart or intelligent, what really matters is how you implement the lessons you get from the book into your own life. I have seen so many people reading books on how to get productive and spending days to go through hundreds of pages only leading to nothing. There was this valuable lesson I learnt while I was learning a new language. Someone in a video said \u201cKnowledge is something if you don\u2019t use it you will eventually lose it\u201d So if you read books only for the sake of fun or hobby without getting the gist of what that book is conveying to you and without using tht knowledge that book is as good as being unread. For me personally the smartest person would be the one who does something with the knowledge he gets from the book . It can be anything from changing your view on life , motivating you to achieve your goal or even sharing your experience of the book with someone. This is the kind of person I regard as Smart. Instead of a person who has this humongous library, and only gloats about the no of books he has read. I hope this helps. ",

It takes more involvement from the brain than watching TV or film, so it\u2019s probably better for you in some ways. Reading can stoke your curiosity, it can help you be more imaginative, but none of these are granted just from reading. Reading doesn\u2019t help much if it doesn\u2019t challenge you on some level. To help make you \u201csmarter,\u201d which is a good all-encompassing term for it, you need to run into words you don\u2019t know, ideas you haven\u2019t engaged with, experiences you haven\u2019t had, or perspectives you haven\u2019t considered. You need to be ready to think critically about what you read, decide if you\u2019re going to accept it or not, and why. You also need to have fun with it, because otherwise it doesn\u2019t stick. Just reading a few lines doesn\u2019t make you smarter. Incorporating the new information you receive into your daily life does. ",

            "answer_text": "Sort of. Sometimes. But not always. A couple of different activities take place when we read: We sometimes learn new information. We sometimes get a repeat of information we already have. And sometimes we trigger new and novel thoughts as a composite of other thoughts due to the reading. An example would be you read something, then start thinking about something else other than what you just read, but slightly connected. The simple act of reading, doesn\u2019t make you smarter by itself, but it does make you better at reading. which you might then use to read more often or longer, and depending on what you ar reading, may learn new things. Smarter is used to describe different abilities that are grouped together. One is rote memory. One is understanding. A third is the creation of new ideas. But it all starts with the initial knowledge that we are picking up. ",

As a five year old child, my godmother sat me on her lap, and started teaching me to read from the Holy Bible. Big, hard to pronounce words. In first grade, I was introduced to the color-coded Weekly Readers series. I basically blew through them, because they were so much easier to read and understand than the Bible. I've had a library card (not the same one) for almost 60 years. I don't necessarily know if reading made me \"smarter\", but it certainly opened up whole new worlds of understanding and knowledge. ",

It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system... for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. i now feel exactly the same way and have numerous reasons to feel that way. so books have opened me up to many truths that had previously eluded me; not only that, but it has made me panic about the fact that, general society as a whole do not know what i now do know. I would actually go as far as saying the stack of books i am currently reading have changed my entire life, my entire outlook, my entire approach, and will in turn change the lives of my children, all for the better. so yes reading makes you smarter.

Certainly our data demonstrate time and again that print exposureis associated with vocabulary, general knowledge, and verbal skills even aftercontrolling for abstract reasoning abilities (as measured by such indicators as theRaven). Although nothing can turn our correlational data into true experimentalfindings, the converging patterns of relationships-most importantly the indicationthat reading habits predict growth in verbal abilities in longitudinal investigations(see Tables V and VI; Anderson et al., 1988; Juel, 1988)-certainlyimply a role for reading experience in a comprehensive theory of cognitivegrowth (its role is at least as well supported as many other mechanisms that haveattained popularity in developmental psychology).

            "answer_text": "This seems like an obviously easy question to answer. Reading does make people in general smarter. But how much smarter is the ultimate question? Some people read a lot, but because of low retention and low ability; they don't profit as much as others from reading the same materials. Some students in college routinely fall asleep while reading their textbooks. They fall asleep and have little to no recollection of what they\u2019ve read--no matter how many times they attempted to read it. Some people can read something once and retain most of it. Also, they can find useful and novel ways of using the information. So two people independent of each other can do the same reading most of their life, beginning in their youth and the results will be uneven in the end. The following assertion I'm about to make is anecdotal and unverified by science as I know it, but if you're interested in something and your learning style is the reading method; your profit from reading will be higher than someone who's not interested in the same subject matter. So interest and ability contribute the most to the reading experience. ",

I seem to recall watching a video saying reading improves your memory and ability to learn. Reading helps you grasp topics quicker and gives you little bits and pieces of information over time, but what really helps is reading challenging books. Those books that are around 900+ pages long. Those are my personal favorite. Find what genre you like and stick with that. Those who don\u2019t like to read, just haven\u2019t found a book that appeals to them. ",

Thinking involves thinking about some subject, applying knowledge to that subject, and thinking correctly and creatively about that subject. If you read truthful, factual, and correctly argued material (including fiction), and if you remember what you read, then you can increase the knowledge available to apply to many subjects. Your reading may also increase the ways you can think about a subject. Your reading can help you avoid cognitive biases. Your reading can teach you scientific methods, mathematical models, and concepts like experimentation, development, evolution, competition, cooperation, probability distributions, degrees of certainty, statistical significance, optimization, and many more. You can use these patterns of thought in your own thinking. But there\u2019s a danger that reading badly could make you less smart. You could read nonsense, misinformation, or only sources that confirm your biases. You could read carelessly, misremembering details or remembering only your feelings as you read. Don\u2019t do that.

            "answer_text": "I put most of this as an answer to one of the other answers regarding reading books and the different genres they mostly fit into. I highly suggest scifi as a way to enter the field of reading and learning. My reasons are below. Scifi doesnt merely take tired tropes and toss some \u2018sciency' words on top. True scifi examines various human cultures and their ideals, taking them apart and placing them into a storyline that creates unease on the part of the reader and allows the reader to begin to parse their own related experiences. For example, Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness. Yes, there are sciency bits and words and concepts, such as how to achieve instantaneous communication over thousands of light years and when and how that would fail, or how androgeny works, but the main thrust of the story line, as it were, is not driven by sciency bits decorating the story lines like ill placed Christmas garlands, and tired tropes. The story follows a human alpha male diplomat who is assigned to a world of mostly androgynous humanoids. I say mostly, as they are truly androgynous for the majority of the time, except they become male or female during their rare sexual \u2018heats.\u2019 This is very difficult for the protagonist, as well as for readers. How do you manuever in a society as a male, who is always a male, when most in the society see that as a biological fail, and a perversion. When most assume you are insane as sexual hormones affect your thoughts and behaviors and tolerate your presence as English kings once tolerated dwarves? How do you convince the society of anything? Much less be a diplomatic envoy? I chose le Guin and the Left Hand of Darkness, as unlike others, she also has a breathtaking soft sciences background. Her middle initial, Ursula K. le Guin, stands for Kroeber, the anthropologist who held Ishi for the last years of Ishi's life. Le Guin has a unique approach to most of her work, from young adult fiction and fantasy to some of her hard core scifi, then the majority of scifi authors. If you truly want to start learning, to pump up those IQ numbers, true scifi is the gateway \u2018drug's into all other genres. Heinlein, Asimov, le Guin, Herbert, Wells, Brin, Atwood, Dick, Gibson, Mary Shelley are just a few scifi authors whom are still giants in the field, and that I love. When reading these, you will come across concepts you will want to pursue further. From math, engineering, solar systems and the universe, physics, language, gender, bioscience, oceanography, culture, anything you can think of and more. What do doulas do in various cultures and when did Western cultures stop using them and midwives and why? How are they used in Eastern cultures, if at all, and what about all the other cultures of the world?? This is only one question you may ask, and seeking that answer outside of the book, may well take the rest of your life to learn, to understand, and perhaps you will be the person to propel these concepts into mainstream again! Or change the entire childbirth field!! Most very intelligent scientists, lawyers, coders, etc., all started with scifi as children and went from there to where they are now, to wherever they push their fields in the future. Textbooks are meant to be one small part of learning about whatever it is about. From medical fields, chemistry, glassmaking, history, economics, home-ec, math, physics, military, ad naseum. Lecture and independent study and research are the other cornerstones of learning. I love going to all types of library sales in hundreds of miles any direction. I pick up a huge variety of encyclopedias, textbooks and medicinal plant books. One would think they are all alike, or have very minor differences. A chemistry book from the 1850s, 1900s, 1950s, 1970s, 1990s, 2010, 2015 will all have some major differences. From topics to how to do home chemistry to how to study chemistry will all have different information. I pick up as many medicinal plant books as I can as not all of the things a plant does is listed in one or ten, nor are there comprehensive pictures from seed to winter and how those plants subtly change appearance in various zones. For example, raspberry tea is generally considered to help a pregnant woman. However, what most modern texts and websites neglect to mention is that raspberry tea is also an abortificant and most pregnant women, or women attempting to become pregnant, should not drink it. Do many pregnant women drink it with no problems? Yes. There will always be an exception. Should women attempting to become pregnant who may have any difficulty doing so, or those who may struggle to retain a fetus, drink it? An emphatic no. Is that information widely disseminated? Not anymore. But you will find studies, both scientific and in the midwife communities and online, that regard raspberry tea as a huge problem and why. I am not in the medical field, nor am I a doula or midwife. I love reading. Taught myself to read at age 2 and have since outread libraries of various small towns to universities. I am not a fan of biographies, but other then that, any port in a storm. I gladly offer to talk about books, genres, how to read for your learning style, and about specific books. I love helping others learn to love reading and learning. Dont hesitate to contact me if you are interested in reading, but find it a mindless chore to do. I will strive to make it not just fun, but seek the educational aspects of any given book or genre, even biographies, and push you to continue learning! ",

            "answer_text": "No. Reading (obtaining more knowledge) can only increase the amount of your potential IQ that you actually use.Knowledge is not intelligence. If knowledge were intelligence, then we\u2019d already have intelligent computers \u2014 computers can store tons of knowledge. Real IQ tests don\u2019t test knowledge. According to the available scientific research, the vast majority of intelligence is hereditary. Although there is much scientific data to back this up, it remains a very unpopular idea. People desperately want IQ to be essentially environmental \u2014 if we can just provide the right stimulus for these disadvantaged children, they will develop higher IQs. The ugly truth is, every such attempt has failed \u2014 utterly.Read the book: The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles MurrayEnvironment seems only to dictate the amount of your potential IQ that you realize. Babies born to low IQ parents who were adopted out at birth or shortly thereafter to higher IQ parents, tended to have slightly higher IQs than their siblings who were not adopted out, but lower IQs than their adoptive siblings. The IQ of the adopted children more closely correlates with their biological siblings than with there adoptive siblings. You are born with a set potential of core intelligence \u2014 which cannot be changed. Your environment (upbringing, available resources [books, education level of your parents, IQ of your parents, opportunities to explore and learn], etc.) determines how much of your potential core intelligence you actually realize. Your IQ is a measure of your realized core intelligence.Although you cannot change your potential core intelligence, you can change how much of it you actually realize.Let\u2019s say you have a potential of lifting 120 lbs. Currently, you can only lift 110 lbs. With practice, you can increase the amount you can actually lift, but you cannot increase that beyond your potential. Thus, in this case, you\u2019d never be able to lift more than 120 lbs. \u2014 no matter how much you work at it. IQ is a measure of your realized core intelligence. If your potential IQ is 120, but your measured IQ is only 110, then you can increase your measured IQ to as high as 120, but no higher.Just as there\u2019s no way to determine how much you can potentially lift \u2014 without pushing you to your limit and discovering what that limit is, there is no way of determining your potential IQ \u2014 without pushing you to your limit and discovering what that limit is. So, what can you do to get closer to your limit in IQ? Do things that require your brain to add new wiring \u2014 things that require you to learn new skills \u2014 mentally and physically. None of this is easy.Became fluent in a new language. The greater the difference between your native language and the new language, the greater the gain you\u2019ll see. However, don\u2019t expect much \u2014 maybe 10 points at the most. Once you\u2019ve mastered one new language, start on another. Assuming English is your native language, consider languages in these groups: Slavic, African (except Afrikaans), Native American, Middle East, Far East. Avoid anything in the latin and germanic families.Learn to play a musical instrument \u2014 really well. Get a bachelor\u2019s degree (or, preferably, higher) in music. I would suggest the piano or any of the non-fretted stringed instruments. Learn to ride a unicycle \u2014 studies have shown a high correlation between improved balance and better penmanship. Whatever learning to ride a unicycle does, it is adding new wiring in your brain and it carries over to other areas. Learn unicycle dance.Study mathematics. Get a bachelor\u2019s degree (or, preferably, higher) in mathematics. Push yourself as far as you can go in mathematics.Study theoretical physics.Studying sample problems from IQ tests will boost your IQ score temporarily but will not provide lasting results and will not increase your actual IQ \u2014 only your IQ score. Read about the failure and redirection of the Head Start program to better understand the difference between increased IQ and increased IQ score. Head Start only produced a temporary increase in IQ score without actually increasing the IQ (which was the original stated goal of the program) of the participant children. ",

            "answer_text": "Books contain words. Words contain knowledge. Knowledge about people, places, and things across every time period. Knowledge about creative things that could inspire you to create yourself. Knowledge is power. It's so typical in our social media-obsessed, impatient generation to just skim over a post online, to the point where we can't even bring ourselves to read a full book, cover to cover. Even skim reading is being taught in schools. It is a skill to be learned, yes, but is a complete disservice when it comes to reading actual books. We don't even need to read books in school anymore thanks to the advent of things like Sparknotes. Therefore, if you can manage to sit through an entire book and actually comprehend it, assuming you are also an avid internet user, you have mastered the art of self-discipline and patience. Becoming smarter requires those two simple things. You don't need a ridiculously high IQ to become smarter. Self-discipline and patience allow you to be able to learn things quickly. And reading books is a step in the right direction for that. ",

For general smarts though, I would recommend reading everything you can get your hands on. Read fiction, non-fiction, poetry, scientific articles, the newspaper, everything. Reading helps to expand your vocabulary, because you will read words you have never heard anyone say before. Reading helps you to empathise with characters who may be extremely dissimilar to you, thus broadening your acceptance of other people and expanding your understanding of the world around you. The more you read, the more you will be able to identify good writing vs poor writing, which will in turn make you a better writer. You will be able to read other people\u2019s thought processes, which will expand your own. By reading how other people solve problems, how they interpret the world around them (whether these people are real or fictional) you will be exposed to new methods to tackle your own problems, both academically and within general life. So while of course, experts on a certain topic are considered \u201csmart\u201d because of their expansive knowledge of a subject, everyone who reads, is smarter than someone who doesn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "It makes you better at reading. Reading is a quicker way to learn than have someone orally explain things to you. If you read, you can probably acquire new information faster than someone who relies on orally transmitted information like TV, radio, YouTube, the guy down the pub etc. So this can help make you better informed but not necessarily smarter. It depends on your definition of \u2018smart\u2019. I imagine smart people are generally more inclined to read, simply because it\u2019s such an effective way of getting information. Of course, if you want to sit down with a leather-bound edition of \u201cThe Wit and Wisdom of Kim Kardashian\u201d, then you\u2019ll probably lose IQ points which might explain Kanye West\u2019s troubling trajectory.

            "answer_text": "Smart people read but reading doesn't necessarily make anyone smarter.  If you're smart, you'll know what to read whether you're seeking accurate information, looking for entertainment, or you just needing to be convinced about important things.  Otherwise, you'll end up reading trash and lowering yourself down to a place worse than where you started.   Smart people know the difference between what's useful and what's garbage.  Because of this, they end up smarter than they were before reading.  Most aren't so lucky either through lack of education or lack of aptitude ending, unfortunately, to error and misinformation. Smart people don't read good books.  They read only the best ones.  That's how they get smarter.  They vary their reading fare, question everything, and learn from mistakes without repeating them.  If you're too lazy to do these, inordinately allowing others to do your thinking for you without verifying your sources, no amount of reading can make you smarter. Good luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "No it doesn't. Intelligence in the classical sense is for the most part an innate ability. If you read a lot you will become more knowledgeable. As you can see there is a clear distinction between the two. The accumulation of knowledge alone doesn't make you intelligent however. Here is an example: even if you memorize a book in its entirety it won't be guaranteed that you've  also understood the meaning behind those words. Just like many people simply just exist (to quote Oscar Wilde) there are many people who just read (without actually registering the deeper meaning of the printed words). So no, reading doesn't make you intelligent. But that shouldn't discourage you from doing it, regardless. ",

            "answer_text": "A book is a compendium of expressed thoughts in a written form. In the earliest human history, humans used sign languages to express what they have in mind. After a prolonged period of time, the art of speech came into place. This became another way of expressing one's thoughts and opinions. Books are the collection of thinking, experiences, and retrospections of other people by the virtue of their life experiences. Humanity had depended on the expression of thought for so many reasons. For teaching, for interaction, for leadership and exercise of constituted authority. We have inherited writing from our ancestors who for ages used writing for expression of thoughts and to preserve ideas, and to remind them as well. We have advanced from the ancient way of writing to modern ways. We now have them written in booms and electronic platforms. Whichever way they are presented.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but the book you\u2019re reading must have some sort of knowledge that you do not yet have. If you read a book that tells you about things that you already know, what you learn from that book will be limited. There is the book; and here is your mind. As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding. If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish, then the author and you are as two minds of the same mold. The symbols on the page merely express the common understanding that you had before you met. \u2014 How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading Gaining information would be learning facts to help prove that you are correct, for example, finding out about a study that proves free weights are better than machines. Gaining understanding is reading a book and not knowing about everything inside of it, for example, finding out about Pareto\u2019s Principle when you know nothing about it. Thus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading. \u2014 How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading Using the above definition, if you constantly read books that contain information that you do not yet understand, you\u2019ll constantly gain the opportunity to increase your understanding and information about a topic. So in short, yes, but only if you read books containing information that you do not yet understand. ",

Rather than watching a movie (unless subtitles are on, I guess), when you read the word more and more they come into your brain and eventually your spelling improves. It\u2019s also beneficial if you\u2019re writing a book yourself; you get to see different writing styles and patterns. Reading also expands your vocabulary (as long as your reading on or above your lexile). Lots of things come from reading, not only educational advances. When you read it transports your into another world, time, and/or place. The words engulf you and pull you into the pages until your eyes are glued to the pages. They bring you joy, pain, and fear just by a large array of randomised letters. It\u2019s really marvellous how a good author can capture you mind and heart. ",

Plain story and no imagination: This include Chetan Bhagat books , I finished his three novels and at the end I got nothing rather than a personal satisfaction that I finished a novel.Good story and a lot of imagination: This include Shiva Trilogy, Dan Brown novels, Andy Meir space fantasy etc. These books have good story and while reading I have to use a lot of Imagination to make sense of the story line. Personally these books makes me more creative and imaginative and to some extent smarter also.The non-fiction: This category definitely makes me smarter . Some of them even change my perspective about the society and myself. This include biographies, philosophy , history etc. The most influential book I read is belong to this category named : Man\u2019s Search For Meaning, The Argumentative India, Elon Musk biography etc.So Does reading make you a smarter person? No: If you belongs to 1st category. Yes: If you belongs to 2nd and 3rd category. ",

On the other hand it also enhances your vocabulary which helps a lot in presenting yourself in front of others .As in the present world you might be as intelligent as Einstein but what matters is how you express youself .Being smart has very little to do with being intelligent the key point of being smart is not in how much you know but in how you use even the smallest part of your knowledgeand make it visible to others. Moreover reading gives you a much broader field to think over .It fills your mind with new ideas and also ample examples and experiences which are more important than any other pety thing . Lastly I would say people who think smartness is only through looks and nothing else are in utter confusion . Yes I agree good looks gives the first impression but that only lasts till you open your mouth and speak and after that what matters is only your attitude and skill of speaking . Hope the answer was useful!!! ",

When you see a 7 foot giant that can beat you to a pulp, and decide to back out; you are smart. Smartness to me is a trait that relates more to decision making. Reading for me, helps me to relate to someone else's experience or viewpoint. It allows you to step out of the closed world that we live in. I say 'closed', because not all of us have access to such experiences, views or ideas. I might not be friends with the great visionaries of my generation, but I somehow learn from their life decisions. What you read, starts to influence your decision making. When you start to gather information, that you might ordinarily not get access to or might not notice otherwise; you become more learned. When you become more learned, you become better at making decisions in a familiar situation. That makes you smarter.  ",

Reading does significantly expand your vocabulary in ways that you may not notice right away. It exposes you to and lets you uncover the context of the words that you\u2019ve probably never heard of before. Reading compels you to look up the meaning of the words you\u2019ve just read; hence as you go further along, the more the sentences make sense to you than before you began reading them. Reading and memory are two interrelated concepts. When you read, you are more of training your brain to retain the ideas and words you are reading, which eventually helps boost your memory. ",

Observing the world and judging good from evil, kind or cruel, appropriate vs. absurd, helpful compared with a waste of time . . . this \u2018observing\u2019 engages all six senses and adds wisdom. Critical judgment, a form of wisdom, emerges. Experiencing broadly, across many activities, and learning from them, will improve a person\u2019s wisdom. Open the mind and heart. Live fully. That brings wisdom. It\u2019s an observing and filtering process, and it offers many levels of acquisition. Think of it like this, in all the forms in which we sense the world: you can have immense amounts of data and little information, oodles of information and not much knowledge, and masses of knowledge but not much wisdom. The reduction from data to wisdom is many orders of magnitude. Wisdom enables a person to make wise decisions about things known to be true and right. Books\u2014the true and right books\u2014will deliver wisdom. The idea that one would even have to ask this question is . . . amazing. It shows a lack of wisdom. ",

Yes, it's very difficult habit to go through but believe it's worth to payoff in sense of forcing your mind for this powerful habit. Reading, enhance our capabilities to handle pressure, stress, fear, anxiety, confusion and many more. Now, what type of books should we read? It's all depends on your area of expertise in regards to your career. If you want to open up a business as Entrepreneur, you need a daily dose of motivational content. Many of you will ask why is it so, it's because Entrepreneur has to gone through multiple breakdowns, problems, stress, fear of failure. The regular dose of motivational content will keep you calm, positive and inspired towards your goal. It's fighting and protecting in the same way as WBC does for our body. ",

Unfortunately it seems that intelligence has a large genetic component to it. I was part of the nurture camp for long but facts are facts. Reading will make you more resourceful with the capabilities you have. Raw intelligence is only valuable when matched with mental models - frameworks that simplify reality. There are extreme amounts of information in the world and without frameworks to sort the data into signal and noise and apply intelligence to the signals, high intelligence doesn\u2019t benefit you. Great books are among the best ways to obtain these mental models. A great book will contain the distilled knowledge of an experienced insider. It\u2019s a fantastic shortcut. To conclude, reading books will not make you more intelligent, but will enable you to do more with what you have, which is in the end what counts. ",

Even reading predominantly fiction can increase vocabulary, which in turn can allow your mind to follow and form more complex concepts. In 1984, George Orwell had his fictional government outlawing words to limit the ability of the populace for independent thought. If you don\u2019t know a word to express concepts like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cautonomy\u201d, even if you have it in your mind, you cannot easily communicate such ideas to others. In Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAnthem\u201d, similar language restrictions were used too, for similar reasons. The word \u201cI\u201d was banned, to emphasis the collective. Reading allows you to both learn from the topic being read, as well as improving brain connectivity. I also think that fiction especially is an exercise in empathy. If you have the ability to feel what the character feels, to exist in their life for a while, you are exercising empathy. (Perhaps the drop off in voluntary reading correlates with the lack of empathy observed in the modern world). ",

If I read only fantasy books, I might pick a few things up, it might help feed my imagination or creativity to a degree and that\u2019s certainly a form of intelligence. But is enough? It\u2019s not enough to simply read, it\u2019s also important that you read well rounded books on various subjects. I will always try to read a couple books every year about subject I\u2019m not particularly interested in just so I can have a little bit more understanding about them. Sometimes they might be connected to something I am more interested in and I want to understand what was being referenced. There are many ways to judge intelligent, but we should be careful not to simply saying that because we read we are smarter than those who do not. I know people who don\u2019t read that many books a year but are incredibly intelligent because they focus their time and effort on real world skills, and I would say their experience makes them highly intelligent.

A person could be born on a deserted Island and have a very high intelligence, but know absolutely nothing about world affairs, algebra, spelling, or other subjects a 12 year old child would know. In other words that person would be ignorant of such subjects. People somehow confuse a person that spouts out a lot of statistics as being intelligent. Some times that person is a great reader and has a good memory and recall and sometimes that person is a complete phony and simply throws out words they have memorized, as if they really know a subject. I have met many people that are fakes. All you do is ask some specific questions about the subject and see if you get an objective answer or if you get more BS. ",

It can also sharpen your pattern-spotting ability (following plots of stories, development of characters real or fictional, organizing information from a non-fiction book in your mind). Reading can make you more knowledgeable than you were, maybe more perceptive and more empathetic, too. This is helpful in making your way in the world of other people. Whether it can actually make you more intelligent or not, I don\u2019t think anyone knows for sure. ",

Any knowledge can be gained through reading- whether it is done digitally or the old fashioned way - with hardbound or paperbound books.  The great thing about reading is that once you get into the habit, well...you become smarter every day that you add knowledge to your knowledge bank.  How much knowledge you acquire depends on your own limitations.  Remove those limitations and you can unleash the power of your mind.  Release the power of your mind and you can do great things.  I know for many making money and lots of it is a goal, but I would gently suggest that using knowledge to help bring peace, create cooperation rather than conflict while still making money would be the ultimate goal of becoming smarter.  Or, another option would be - improving humanity through science, or the arts...well that would be the greatest achievement. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading serious literature has been shown to improve \"EQ\", presumably by elaborating on human conflict, the human pysche, and parsing it in detail. Non-fiction can teach you new facts, and pick apart concepts that you may only be familiar with in passing. You may have heard of \"quantum physics\" but only by reading 10 popular physics books are you likely to have a grasp of what it is exactly. So I'd say reduces ignorance, improves empathy and analytical ability, improves focus and goal-directed character, and lets you learn from thousands of people throughout history instead of being limited to the few hundred you will meet day-tod-day.

Well\u2026 I would say that it depends on the books you read. When I was younger, I read a bunch of nonsense books like all kids do. Harry Potter, Captain Underpants\u2026 all that stuff. But then I started reading other books that were interesting and actually historical. This sparked an interest that lead me to learn all sorts of useless and awesome information. So I think books do make you smarter if you read intelligent books, but I also think that you learn more from the passions that reading sparks. Hope that was helpful :) ",

How you interpret the information and use that to your own advantage makes you a smart person. Example reading about the football rules and techniques will not make you a smarter person but playing the game will make you a smarter person. My point is this do not just read for the sake of reading, use the principles you read, read them again and again until those are stuck in your brain at subconscious level. Reading is of no use unless and until you have the guts to apply the stuff that you read. I have read books on wealth like \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d and I am not rich because I am still waiting for the moment to apply those principles that I read. I have also read the book \u201cThick And Grow Rich\u201d and I failed my University exams. Till now I can say that I have read pretty good numbers of books but I am stupid. I do stupid mistakes. Reading enhances your knowledge but it\u2019s up to you how you use that knowledge and for what purpose and will you be able to achieve that purpose by just reading? ",

            "answer_text": "Reading has had the greatest effect on my understanding of myself and empathy for others. Because I have vicariously experienced many life events and traumas first in books, they were not as frightening when they popped up in real life. Because I have learned to love characters from many economic levels and from different cultures, I am more open in real life meetings with people who are different from me. Reading has also increased my knowledge in some areas: vocabulary, grammar, writing, geography, and history. It has piqued my interest and triggered further study in the sciences, religion, the Bible, and foreign languages. But there are other intelligences I have not developed through reading. I would not say I have learned as much about time management or money management either. I haven't learned to be a good gardener, to make useful things, to fix my car or to be a good cook from reading, but other people may have. I learn some things better from other people teaching me directly, and some things I may always struggle with. But that helps me appreciate those who have instinctive or learned intelligence in those areas. Everyone has something to contribute. ",

Do you keep an open mind while reading, willing to sway one way or another based on the evidence given by the writer or are you doing in with a closed mind ready to argue and fight until the bitter end? It is completely up to you. The truth is usually half way between one side and the other maybe slightly more on one side. If you are not open minded when listening or reading you will not absorb anything that they have to say. You cannot learn with a closed mind. ",

I would say reading fluff (romance novels, some graphic novels) does not make you smarter. If you want to read for \u201csmartness\u201d read something challenging, that you are also interested in. So if you like cooking, read a science book on the chemistry of cooking. Or watch videos on food science. Or, in my case, I like science. So I read books written for lay people on topics like absolute zero or fractal geometry. I\u2019ll never be a scientist, but it helps me think about the things I already know in a different way. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Does reading make you clever?\" Yes and no. What reading does is expand your intellectual capacity and therefore allows you to intake more and be open to an increased intake. It reduces limitations and primitivism of individual's mental state and moves it to higher plane - further away from the animals, and into the realm called humanity. This is especially true for reading fiction. Non-fiction can in theory make you clever because you are learning something new. Reading will not turn you into Einstein, but it will enhance you and the quality of your life. ",

What's much more important, however, in terms of boosting your intelligence, is how you react to what you've read. If reading leads to you questioning things, then it is indeed likely to help you improve your intelligence. If, however, you merely passively absorb what you've read, unquestioningly, this might boost your knowledge, but it can have a limited or even distinctly negative impact on your intelligence. Being intelligent is largely about having a questioning mind. If reading is to make you more intelligent, then it needs to provoke questions, not just provide answers. Gifted  ",

Tell me when was the last time you comprehended and remembered something useful from television? Internet is no better (there are useful things,I admit). The noise to signal ratio is too high on Internet,you'll have to weed out lots of unnecessary info to get something worthwhile reading. Books are entirely different things, they make you grasp,imagine,learn,concentrate and if it's a good one make you shed a tear or two that you've finished it. Upside: you can always know what you're about to read. Downside: there are none,even if it's a bad book you'll add some new words to your vocabulary. Read and reap!

            "answer_text": "Its a simple mantra- if you have to gain knowledge you have to read. The more you read, the more you surf, the more knowledgeable you become. I suggest to ready anything you come across, anything you find interesting you must go on and dig more and more knowledge about that. Internet is an ocean of knowledge and in everyday life we may come across millions of things of which we dont know the answers, we should develop that \u2018ask\u2019 inside us to learn about that thing. It could be the silliest of things but still we should have that eagerness to know about that. We need to develop interest in reading and through that only we ll be able to gain knowledge. One can start by reading newspaper in morning, this would develop a good habit of reading, although we should only focus on quality material to read in newspapers. The book that I would recommend to people who want to gain knowledge is \u2019The Encyclopaedia\u2019, it has information of almost everything and that too in a very concise way. One page daily will be very beneficial for anyone who wants to develop a reading habit and wants to gain knowledge out of that. The next step should be trying to focus on the motivational books rather than the fictional ones. Motivational books or the autobiographies enhances our vision and gives us a good direction in life.  Surfing on internet is one of the best way to gain knowledge, a very easy exercise is that generate a curiosity inside to know how and why. Like when you are travelling, just try to think that how a car takes turn, or how an engine starts, then just push yourself to read about that by this way you will gain knowledge.  One must not confine himself/herself to a particular field, we must have knowledge of about every field. ",

When you are gaining lots and lots of knowledge you will start analyzing things in a better way compared to other people. There you gain wisdom from knowledge. Intelligence is nothing but finding the best possible solutions and outcomes in every situation you face. The only way to gain it is by practice. ",

If you read trash romance, for the fun of it, to forget it so you don\u2019t notice how much it is like the next one you read, it doesn\u2019t have any effect. In my definition intelligence is using IQ and knowledge to figure things out. Books can give you the knowledge and can help with the thought processes to do intelligent things. Books are more a matter of knowledge than intelligence in themselves, but they can help increase effective intelligence. ",

I missed going to high school altogether, but late in life passed all the exams needed (BY studying all the necessary subjects on my own) and went to a very good university and have a B.A. with honour, know 4 languages quite well if I restudy before I have to use them.(French, English,Italian, and German) What I gained by reading, which is most important to me, is an understanding of many different cultures and races so that I respect people no matter their language, religion ,country of origin and I always see them as equals. Though many people I meet are of course more clever more everything I also feel I\u2019m OK, because my reading has given me an earth understanding than just a Canadian understanding. So the more you read about other countries, cultures beliefs, the more you can understand human beings. This is what makes me more accepting of my brethren, homo sapiens . No matter where I go, I feel I belong, I\u2019m OK. What could be better? ",

Only one single book is needed to make you get started. Voltaire thought fiction books were meant for women. What I\u2019m saying here is; you have to avoid fiction books at any cost.  Reading any book without reflecting about it yourself is merely a waste of time. Because you are only filling your mind with someone else\u2019s thoughts. If you have time, you too, can write your own book and it will be sold into the market. Do you believe someone can become smart after reading your books? To be smart is to have and apply the right information at the right time. Having good resource of books will make you smart, if you have a strong mentality too.

On the other hand, reading with purpose helps me answer questions and understand the topic better. I have tried several ways of how to read effectively. My favorite so far, as well as the most effort consuming method, is reading and reasoning simultaneously till it makes sense to me instead of accepting it as a fact.
