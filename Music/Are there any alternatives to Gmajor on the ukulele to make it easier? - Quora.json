Practice and repetition will make it easy. That\u2019s it. Things only seem difficult because you\u2019re learn them. You\u2019ll have it down soon\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The standard format is 0-2-3-2. You can use whatever fingering you are most comfortable with, including barring the first 3 strings at the second fret and dropping another finger on the 3rd fret of the 2nd string. A major chord is a I-III-V chord, which means it needs at least one each of the G, B and D notes to create the chord. You can double up any one of the three notes on the ukulele. The 0-2-3-2 are actually playing the notes G-D-G-B. Doubling the root note of the chord (the G) is always a good idea. You can play those notes anywhere on the keyboard, but it is always a good idea to keep them close to each other so you can fret with one hand. ",
