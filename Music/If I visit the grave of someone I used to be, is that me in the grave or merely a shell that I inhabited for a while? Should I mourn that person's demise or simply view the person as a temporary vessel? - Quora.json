            "answer_text": "Funny question. And fun\u2026 I was researching someone that I recalled - a previous lifetime that I remembered while filming a deep hypnosis session, where I remembered being a specific person. I had his name, the city he was in, the life he led, and the dates he led them. I was startled to find this fellow in the historical records (as reported in \u201cArchitecture of the Afterlife\u201d and even more startled to find that they had \u201cput his body on display.\u201d In doing this research, I hear it often; we don\u2019t bring all of our conscious energy to a lifetime. So we aren\u2019t \u201c100% that person\u201d - (even though it feels that we are while here) and that our conscious energy is a mix of \u201call of our lifetimes.\u201d So if one can think of a juice drink that has all kinds of fruit - and its blended, and then a portion of it is poured into a lifetime, it might help understand the process. Then when that lifetime is over, that \u201cone third\u201d of our conscious energy returns the pitcher of fruit juice - bringing all the memories and experiences of that lifetime and then blending it with the others. So even if we find or discover someone\u2019s tomb or gravestone that we recall being - a soldier in the Civil War for example, we aren\u2019t completely that person either. We are who we are - but we are an amalgamation of everyone we\u2019ve been. At least that\u2019s what the research shows. My two cents. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you talking about visiting your past life personality\u2019s grave? How cool is that! - to be able to find the grave and the records of your past life. This is quite rare - most regression clients never get the second name or the name of the town or any details allowing them to find find the records of this personality. Plus you can\u2019t find any records before the industrial age, or tribal lives\u2026Clients get the life story, the emotions, the lessons, and skills, but hardly ever the full name and place to verify the existence of this person. This is a fun material for books or Youtube videos. You should go with your own feelings. Did they die young and were not able to fulfill the life plan? In this case, maybe you should release all the feelings related to the untimely death, as you are still holding them deep inside yourself\u2026 Or did they die peacefully surrounded by family and were happy to leave the worn-out body? What was their last thought? What happened after they left the body? How do you relate to their life? What do you share? What do you resent about them? What skills or character traits you want to keep from that life? What spiritual lessons did you learn? After all - you and they are related \u2018by the spirit\u201d - you are not exactly them in a new body, but you share the essence, the immortal soul. Different people have different relationships with their past life personalities - some adore them and spend lots of time researching them, writing books about them, starting Facebook pages on their name, channeling them, etc. (this usually happens when the PL personality was more or less famous). Others befriend them as \u2018imaginary friends\u201d. A powerful and wise past life personality can be your Spirit Guide in specific tasks like healing, art, writing, meditation, etc. If you do not relate to them very much - you can just let it go, and look at that personality as just one of many \u2018costumes\u201d your soul wore on Earth.
