            "answer_text": "Islands In The Stream was written by The Bee Gees and was sung by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. It was released as the first single from Rogers\u2019 album Eyes That See In The Dark in August 1983. The song was named after Ernest Hemingway\u2019s novel Islands In The Stream. It was originally written for Marvin Gaye in an R&B style but, it was changed later for Kenny Rogers\u2019 album. I\u2019ve heard both The Bee Gees version and the Kenny & Dolly version. Both sound good and I\u2019ve also heard covers of this song. ",
