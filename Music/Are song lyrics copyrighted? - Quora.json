Short phrases like \u201cI love you so\u201d usually can\u2019t meet the threshold of originality required for copyright protection. Song titles are not protected by copyright. There are many songs (and books and movies) that have the same title. Note that I am not a lawyer, and I am giving you my layman\u2019s understanding of copyright, not legal advice. ",

(Registration helps you if you ever have to go to court.) Historically, song publishers have been notoriously strict against publishing even a couple of lines of lyrics without permission. How the World Wide Web has changed that, with lyrics available unofficially all over the place, I don\u2019t know. ",

It was an absurd accusation, but fams tore off the doors of his lawyers offices thinking that he was there. He wasn't, but he paid for new doors. And he now has any tape sent to him sealed and returned. Sad for anyone hoping to getting him to listen to their music.",
