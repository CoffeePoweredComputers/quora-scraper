I\u2019d say in orchestra, first violins have the most parts, and then it\u2019s the cellos, violas, and so on. I\u2019ll make a list.. Orchestra first violinscellossecond violinsviolasbassesAnd if there\u2019s a harp or piano or percussion, then they\u2019d probably be before the basses. I\u2019m only basing this on the amount of melodic lines the sections get to have. Basses almost never have the melody. I can\u2019t really answer for band instruments because I\u2019m not part of band. However, triangles and xylophones probably are lower on the hierarchy. ",
