            "answer_text": "To record your laptop screen activities all you need is an easy screen recorder. Normally, you need to find out a powerful screen recorder which meets your general needs including able to record screen with audio, record screen in designated area, capture video from webcam, additional advanced tools and necessary editor. Here I set RecMaster which I use mostly as an example to demonstrate how to record laptop screen. Step 1: Download and install RecMaster package on your computer. Step 2: Decide the recording mode. It offers five recording options for Windows user, you can choose among full screen, custom area, webcam, audio only, game mode. As for me, I usually use Full screen mode to capture my computer screen. Step 3: Do recording settings. Choose video format, quailty, frame rtae, mouse cursor audio source and file resolution as you want. Step 4: Start recording with REC button and then end with Stop menu. Now you\u2019ve got the recorded video showing your screen movements. Click the editor icon to cut and merge any unwanted clips if necessary. After that, you can upload your video to YouTube or Google Drive in one-click operation. You can also try other simple screen recorders that work in the same way as RecMaster ",
