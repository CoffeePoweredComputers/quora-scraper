Here is an extract. \u2018And now I'm standing at your doorstepWith Los Angeles behind me dearIf you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied'Cause I really need to see you You're not here when I break inI'm gonna go into your closetJust so I can smell your skinAs the chemicals swimI know I'll never love againI swear I'll never love again\u2019 Enjoy!
