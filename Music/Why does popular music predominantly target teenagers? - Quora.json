            "answer_text": "Look back on your life and think about all the songs that have had great emotional resonance for you. A teenager and young adult does not have much life to look back on. They have not yet developed a vast memory bank full of meaningful moments and meaningful songs. So they're fresh for indoctrination. Simple as that. Teenagers and young adults are in that stage of their life where they're busy creating amazing new memories for the first time. This makes them more receptive to new songs (as opposed to \"This isn't as good as stuff back in the day...\"), and more likely to build lasting memories- that means more royalties. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they are lifelong customers, brand-familiarity and all that.Also teenagers probarbly spend more time grouped together where as adults more time working ect, so word gets around quick. They have pocket money/allowances ect (well, the lucky ones) and when they are old enough to work they will probably be loyal fans, buy more records, and go to more gigs. Teenagers also themselves are going through a very changing and through-provoking phase I guess, being more aware of lifes issues and less naive to world, and in many ways perhaps thats why they are draw back to the music and the content at times itself? But with having teenagers as a fan base, I guess some bands see that as a strategy to have life-long and loyal followers, ",
