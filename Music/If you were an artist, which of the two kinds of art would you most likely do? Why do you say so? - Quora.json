I do mostly music because i have skills for it, i\u2019ve always had musical sensibilities, ever since I was a child. It\u2019s also the easiest way for me to make abstract concepts into a work that conveys the ideas that i feel the need to express efficiently, i\u2019ve tried painting and drawing but i just can\u2019t abstract ideas the same way ",

            "answer_text": "I am an artist\u2026 and two of my worst weaknesses as such are my inability to focus on just one or perhaps two mediums and become more skilled at these specific tools and techniques. And my complete lack of artistic definition or recognizable style. I am a person who loves art and getting into all different types of creativity and styles while learning new ways and techniques along the journey. Sometimes I even create new techniques all together. It\u2019s what keeps me coming back again and again\u2026 the excitement of trying new things and using new products. I do at times go through phases, like my illustration phase (which is a recurring event) but even then, none of my work looks the same or has a cohesive theme or style or artistic category. It\u2019s not all that different from me in real life actually. I tend to fall somewhere in the middle gray area on most subjects, able to understand and feel empathy for both sides. Anyway, in art it can be a struggle\u2026 not knowing what your identity is. However, maybe that is my identity- I\u2019m an eclectic, multi medium, style changing, open minded, unaffiliated with any type alone- artist! Woah, I think I\u2019ll just stick with artist or maybe flexible artist. if I did have to pick my current two favorite or most used art details\u2026. It would probably be illustration/line work and the medium would be fine liner. But that could very well change by tomorrow! Here\u2019s a quick illustration I did using fine liner. Be well and stay safe.  ",
