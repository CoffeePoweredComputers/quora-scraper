I like to let things, just, happen. City and Colour: \u201cThe Grand optimist\u201d I fear I'll die from complications,complications due to things that I've left undoneThat all my debts will be left unpaid, feel like a cripple without a caneI'm like a jack of all trades who's a master of none I\u2019m in Grade 10, and although I am good at several things and am considering several different careers, I fear that everything bad that can happen to a person, will happen to me. That I won\u2019t do well as an adult. YunggTez, Rico Nasty and Big Tee: No Reason They gon' hate me regardless, that's why I do what I do (what I do)See me in person I'm flawless, I might just snatch up your dude (hahaha) Although I have many friends, I am always bullied in some form, no matter where I go. This has happened all my life, and I am so used to it, that instead of trying to pretend to be something that I am not, I roll with it. .I make the jokes I like to make, and I make a fool of myself to make people laugh. People will bully me anyway, so I might as well make it fun! :) And lastly, Benny: Little Game Bounded all thoughts\nand corrected common sense\nyou're raising suicidalswith your predetermined titleslike a mess, distressed\nI am unimpressed\nYour excess\nA dress\nIs all you'll ever be\nGender roles impose control\nAnd deceive progressive times\nWelcome, to the land of the broken mind All my life, People have imposing gender roles on me, even though some of them don\u2019t realize it sometimes. Because of that, I am always advocating against gender roles and stereotypes, because I think that they\u2019re really bad and prevent the world from progressing. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny, I have a playlist called \u201cThis is me\u201d that would be a perfect answer for this question. Since it would take too long to translate all the lyrics (most of the songs are in Italian) I\u2019ll make a collage with those verses that describe me the most: Song: Fuori dall\u2019hype (Far from the hype) \u2014 PTN Because we are far from the hype, far from the hype, far from the hype and however it ends I never cry This is how I felt (and to some degree I still feel) almost every day of my life: out of place, out of time, far from what everybody else was interested in at the moment. Song: Antartide \u2014 PTN When your friends talked about sex you raised walls and couldn\u2019t breathe Some of them then got pregnant while you were still in your fortress Men, you see, are strange animals, just like your nanny said: they can forget holocausts But almost never a woman\u2019s face I really don\u2019t understand men, okay? I\u2019m that shy, awkward girl who loses her ability to talk whenever her crush is around. Pathetic, I know. Song: Gun song \u2014 The lumineers Things I knew when I was young Some were true and some were wrong And one day I pray I\u2019ll be more of my father\u2019s son I\u2019m twenty years old and I\u2019ve made a few mistakes along the way, thinking \u2014 with all the arrogance only a teenager could have \u2014 that I knew better. Moreover, I thought that I could succeed where my parents had failed and while the first belief was surely naive and preposterous, I\u2019m still holding onto this one. These lyrics are a bit of a slap in the face, like \u201comg, I was so stupid and I still am\u2026 But there\u2019s also still time to make amend!\u201d Song: La nostra pelle (Our skin) \u2014 Ex-Otago Sometimes it\u2019s more difficult when you\u2019re sober Sometimes self love gives space to a visceral hate Sometimes I fall in love with me and I start dancing again Sometimes I want to leave myself, but I don\u2019t know where to go Sometimes I fall in love with me and I start playing again And even if between you and you there\u2019s no understanding Even if you have no time to listen to yourself Even if you don\u2019t have the answer Never. Betray. Yourself They may seem very sad lyrics (and I didn\u2019t even get started!) but that\u2019s exactly the point: it\u2019s easy for me to love my bright side, my creativity and all the good qualities\u2026 That are there\u2026 Somewhere\u2026 And that are promptly evoked by an happy song. It\u2019s much more difficult \u2014 when I\u2019m sober and when I\u2019m drunk too \u2014 to love the constant rage that lives beneath and has to be kept under control, the lack of social skills and self esteem, the regrets I carry around\u2026 They\u2019re still part of me, though, and this playlist has been in a way therapeutic: listening to these song I realized I saw myself in what they were describing \u2014 and if I liked the song and the meaning, why shouldn\u2019t I appreciate what I am?
