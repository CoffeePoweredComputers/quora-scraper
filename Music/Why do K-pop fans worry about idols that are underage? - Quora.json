            "answer_text": "Being under so much pressure and constantly being watched by the whole public at such a young age is a lot to handle. When you\u2019re that young, constant criticism and hate can do a lot to your head. On top of that, underage members are sometimes given revealing clothing and sexualized by both their companies and fans. I mean just an example, I unfortunately saw a lot of people in their mid to late twenties sexualizing the members of NCT Dream even when they were all underage. When they debuted the were all between the ages of 14\u201317, and while all the members except Jisung are adults now, when they were still minors a LOT of people made really weird and creepy comments about them. And that\u2019s just the fans, young idols are also at risk within their companies. We don\u2019t know what staff and people that they work with are like. ",

            "answer_text": "Mainly because these idols are very young but are being exposed to an industry that is a lot darker than it seems. I personally start worrying for underaged idols when I begin to see some adult \u201cfans\" sexualizing them. Some underaged idols are also given very revealing clothing by stylists and I get worried because they look very uncomfortable and vulnerable and there are creepy people who will sexualize them. ",
