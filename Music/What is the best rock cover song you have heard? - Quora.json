            "answer_text": "1. Jimi Hendrix - All along the watchtower. Arguably the greatest cover version ever. Hendrix takes Dylan's intimate classic and turns it into an apocalyptic rock masterclass that along with the Rolling Stones Gimme shelter perfectly captures the dark end to the optimistic sixties. 2. Bryan Ferry - A Hard rain's a-gonna fall. Another Dylan song. This time Ferry takes Dylan's intimate and foreboding folk classic and turns it on it's head to present something much more fun and quirky. Ferry has always been a brilliant interpreter of other people's songs and this is one of his best performances. 3. The Byrds - Wasn't born to follow. Written by Carole King and George Goffin, it originally appeared on King's group The City's album Now that everything's been said. This version by The Byrds is the superior version and used to great effect in the film Easy rider. 4. Soft Cell - Tainted love. Marc Almond stays close to Gloria Jones original version but gives it an electro eighties sheen that makes this a great cover version. 5. Emmylou Harris - For no one/Here, there and eeverywhere. These are absolutely beautiful versions of the Lennon-McCartney classics which are certainly not inferior to the brilliant originals. 6. Isaac Hayes - By the time I get to Phoenix. Great version. The superb intro narration is the icing on the cake of this great version of the Jimmy Webb song. 7. The Beatles - Rock and roll music. Infectious and energetic version of the Chuck Berry classic. Lennon is on top rock'n'roll vocal form on this enjoyable track. 8. Joe Cocker - With a little help from my friends. A superb example of taking a song and totally reshaping it but still not losing any of the brilliance of the original. Excellent. 9. Bruce Springsteen - Jersey girl. Springsteen makes Tom Waits' classic his own on this excellent live version from the boss's 1975-1985 box set. 10. Madness - It must be love. Lovely version of Labbi Siffre's classic track. Great fun. 11. Sid Vicious - My way. Brilliantly sloppy and messy version of the standard. It really has got an attitude to it so much that Martin Scorcese used it at the end credits of Goodfellas. 12. Sinead O'Connor - Nothing compares to you. The ultimate version of the Prince song. Perfect. 13. Judy Collins - Both sides now. Lovely version of the great Joni Mitchell song. Just beautiful. 14. Pet shop boys - Always on my mind. The synth duo take the old Elvis Presley standard and turn it into a great, upbeat dance record. Great fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Jimi Hendrix\u2019s cover of Dylan's All Along the Watchtower has to be one of the best known and most successful Rock covers as is Nirvana\u2019s cover of early Bowie track The Man Who sold the World but there are plenty of other great covers. The Susie Q cover by Creedance Clearwater Revival (a late rockabilly tune by Dale Hawkins) is all that is good about a cover, building on the original by restyling it while respecting the original song. Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails Hurt is one of the best covers of a rock song l\u2019ve heard Likewise Satisfaction by Cat Power which is a total rearrangement of the Rolling Stones original and slyly introduces new meaning when sung from a female perspective. Brand New Cadillac by the Clash would have to be a contender, originally a very early UK Rockabilly number by Vince Taylor. Both versions below and is a rock cover of a Rock n Roll song.  One of the best Rock and Bob Dylan covers is It's all over Now Baby Blue by Them with Van Morrison on vocals. Pete Bardens later of Camel plays the haunting organ lines, all to be sampled later by Beck. The aforementioned All Along the Watchtower by Jimi Hendrix. Little known fact: Bob Dylan would later go on to cover Jimi Hendrix's cover of his original song, this is technically known as Double coverage - Wikipedia Blondie's cover of Hanging on the Telephone surpasses the great original by the Nerves. The Rolling Stones did a great cover of It\u2019s All over Now but the Valentino's original with Bobby Womack is better (but not on YouTube) Patti Smith Group cover the Byrd's So You Want to be a Rock n Roll Star but again not as good as the original But my vote today goes to the cover of the 1975 Glam Rock song below  which was totally blown away by this amazing cover  Joan Jett and the Black hearts total reboot of l Love Rock n Roll  There are so many others; the Bangles cover Big Star\u2019s sublime September Gurls The Ramones - Let's Dance, Baby l love You & Needles & Pins The Pretenders cover Stop Your Sobbin\u2019 and also covered an excellent old Kinks demo I go to Sleep This Mortal Coil\u2019s cover of Tim Buckley's Song to the Siren Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds version of All Tomorrow's Parties by the Velvet Underground - one of the better VU covers Sweet Jane - Cowboy JunkiesThe Who - Young Man Blues (Mose Allison) & Summertime Blues (Eddie Cochrane) & Shakin\u2019 all over (Johnny Kidd & the Pirates)Thin Lizzy - Rosalie (Bob Seeger)The Byrd's - Mr Tambourine ManJack Whites recent cover of Little Willie John\u2019s I\u2019m Shakin Dinosaur Jr's cover of the Cure\u2019s Just Like Heaven and \u201cunique\u201d cover of Peter Frampton\u2019s Show Me the Way Take me to the River - Talking Heads (Al Green)China Girl - David Bowie (a David Bowie/Iggy Pop cowrite originally released by Iggy)Bruce Springsteen - Frankie Teardrop (original by NYCs Suicide)Guns & Roses - Ain\u2019t it Fun (Rocket from the Tombs/Dead Boys) Warm Leatherette - Grace Jones (The Normal cover)The Dictators - Raw Power (the Stooges)New York Dolls - Pills (Bo Diddley)The Fall - Mr Pharmacist (originally by The Other half) I\u2019m not your Stepping Stone - Sex Pistols & Minor Threat (Paul Revere & the Raiders/the Monkees) The Cramps - Primitive Louie Louie by the KingsmenThe Rutles - Ouch (orig. Beetles Cover)  One of my favourites is ZZ Top\u2019s cover of Reverberation originally by Texan Psychedelic pioneers The 13th Floor Elevators which is so good it's not available on YouTube, here's the Jesus & Mary Chains version off the same Rory Erickson tribute album.   Before Billy Gibbons formed ZZ Top in 1969 (the oldest Rock group playing with ALL the original members perhaps?), he was in the Moving Sidewalks, a band somewhat in thrall of the 13th Floor Elevators who they played support for on occasion.
