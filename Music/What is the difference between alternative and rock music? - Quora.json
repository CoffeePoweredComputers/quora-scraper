            "answer_text": "Alternative rock is an American term for a subset of rock music ie an alternative to 'mainstream' rock. In the UK it's known as 'indie' (short for 'independent'). It was traditionally characterised by the following attributes: Not easily available, being released on small labels that didn't have the marketing clout of the major labelsNot easily heard, only being played on college radio (US) or on specialist radio programmes (UK)'Challenging' to listen to (ie not 'chart' or 'radio' friendly), hence the previous 2 points. It could be challenging melodically, lyrically, sonically, or it could be challenging from a (lack of) production or a production style at odds with (then) current trends. Or a combination of any or all of these factors. The point was it didn't sound like 'the usual stuff'. It was different. These boundaries are pretty fluid though, and a lot of music that was considered 'alternative' at the time would now be considered 'mainstream' eg REM was considered alternative from 1983 to 1987, Nirvana became mainstream pretty soon after 'Nevermind' and so on. And as alternative music became more popular in the 90s (becoming mainstream in the US with grunge and Britpop in the UK), it was used as a marketing strategy to make mainstream music more 'cool' and 'edgy' eg Alanis Morrisette's first album, a strategy still used today (eg Lana Del Rey). However, we are talking about the past. With the internet making all music easily available, access is no longer an issue. Music no longer has to be 'sought out', merely googled. And as mainstream music success becomes less financially lucrative, what is mainstream and what is alternative is increasingly more s matter of opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, alternative rock is already rock. I\u2019m sure you asked how we differentiate it from other forms of rock. Short Answer: Most of the time you cannot. If you want to differentiate between Alternative and classical, then it\u2019s possible. Same can be said about Psychedelic rock and Alternative or maybe Heavy Metal and Alternative Rock. But if you want to distinguish between Indie, New Wave, Post Punk and Alternative . That\u2019d be a lot difficult. Why? To be honest, the notion of genre, as a single distinguishing parameter of sound is fading. Also the reason lies in history of how the term Alternative was coined and how its meaning has changed ever since. \u201cExisting as an 'other,' alternative music should, in theory, simply sound unlike whatever the prevailing popular-musical models of the day are. Meaning, if you don't know exactly what it is, at least you know what it's not.\u201d [HISTORY] : You can skip this. Historically, the term Alternative was basically an umbrella term coined to describe all the independent styles that grew post 1980\u2019s. Slowly these different styles started getting differentiated on the basis of music and styles. This distinction was majorly because of magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth. These styles were popular among college kids, youth local bars and pubs. These styles were not supposed to be mainstream. But, inevitably, change came. First REM, old 'college-rockers,' cracked the mainstream. Former avant-garde noise outfit Sonic Youth signed with a major-label. And, then, Nirvana came out of nowhere to be the biggest band in the world. Grunge was a license to print money, sending major-label A&Rs into a frenzy. So, this kind of mainstream crossover left Alternative genre with an identity crisis. What was alternative to mainstream was now the mainstream? There are however some ways we might try to use to find some distinction. What gives alternative rock a distinctive touch is the lyrics mainly (at least in theory obviously the courtesy of various magazines) . Their lyrics is transgressive is nature i.e they talk about violation of moral or social boundaries (something very akin to punk rock as well). They could talk about politics, about how we as working class are being screwed, they might talk about wars etc. More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism.You might as well argue that their is lot of classical stuff talking about the same, in fact much of the rock lyrics as we know it dealt with aforementioned topics. Yes, it is indeed like that. But again, it just consolidates my previous argument that it\u2019s difficult to distinguish some rock from alternative rock. [See Footnote] Coming to it\u2019s characteristics as such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although The New York Times in 1989 asserted that the genre is \"guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback\u201dBut that\u2019s not again typical to just alternative bands. If you look at the scene today. It\u2019s another level of frenzy with the catching up emergence of EDM . To sum it up, you can know if a band is alternative either when it is listed by Grammy for nominations under Best Alternative category or simply let the band show it up on their Wiki page.  Footnote: This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s. This even finds it root way back in the punk rock era. Punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets , spike bands and other anti-authoritarian ideologies. The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The punk rock scene went through the post-punk phase and evolved into what came to be known as Alternative rock. ",
