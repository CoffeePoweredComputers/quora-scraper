            "answer_text": "It\u2019s definitely not just in California. Check this post out: Approximately how many separate songs are on the playlist of a typical \"classic rock\" station? My dad listens to the local \u201cclassic rock\u201d station here in AR and they are still playing the same songs that they played 30 years ago when I was a kid. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right. These stations have lazily been repeating the same playlist of \u201cFeels like the first time\u201d, \u201cBest of my love\u201d, and \u201cGo your own way\u201d over and over for years. (Those songs are so overplayed that I don\u2019t even have to mention the artists/bands names and you already know what songs I\u2019m talking about.) These stations have placed a veil over their listeners eyes by indirectly saying that THIS is \u201cclassic rock\u201d\u2026this very narrow sliver of nostalgia. And sadly, their listeners don\u2019t get anything else. They don\u2019t realize that the majority of the great songs of their youth isn\u2019t in rotation. Yes, I can see how the goal wouldn\u2019t be to \u201cplay all the thousands of songs that are out there\u201d. That\u2019s called the Straw Man Argument: A fallacy that includes any lame attempt to \u201cprove\u201d a point by overstating, exaggerating, or over-simplifying the point at hand. And yes, I think we all understand that radio stations are in the business of making money. I feel like they could attract new listeners by adding about 500 songs to their playlists. The other comment is basically saying that the more a song is played, the more popular that song becomes, and thus \u201cfans\u201d are going to want to hear that song more. Well, that\u2019s the biggest load I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. Stop underestimating your listeners intelligence. Yes, people respond to what is familiar, but they\u2019d rather hear something they haven\u2019t heard in awhile over something they\u2019ve already heard a thousand times. Yes, some really old people may feel funny about hearing a song they haven\u2019t heard recently, but that\u2019s because they are used to hearing the same songs on repeat day after day. A song magically came on the other day that my dad hadn\u2019t heard in a long time and I thought he was going to have a heart attack. He literally froze, stared off into the distance and said,\u201d Wow\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard this song in 20 years.\u201d He was mesmerized. He loved it. Well, that\u2019s the end of my rant. :) ",

            "answer_text": "You specifically ask about classic rock and that genre of music really doesn\u2019t have any new songs coming into it. People who listen to classic rock tend to be nostalgic about that era of music and clearly have their favorites. No new songs, a group of people (target audience) who have their favorites is a formula for playing the same songs repeatedly. That actually is only part of the answer though. I believe in the mid to late 90's, a study was done about peoples listening habits on the radio. The most important take away from that study was basically the following premise which what stations still follow to this day.As a whole, when people are scanning through radio stations and come upon a song they like, they will stop on that station (no surprise there). What was learned though is generally the person would not turn the station unless they played a song the person didn't like (again, no real surprise). However, if you want to exploit this fact, limiting the songs you play to a select list of around 20 songs makes it much less likely you will offend the listener (resulting in a change of station). So keeping a playlist small is advantageous to not losing listeners and as a result you get the same songs played over and over. Combined with the fact every other station is following the same basic premise the alternatives really are no different. One other important note I'm not sure of when it changed is that stations have to pay record companies if they play past a percentage of song. Apparently, this is no small cost as I've heard it discussed by talk radio guys about being limited in what they were allowed to play because the station wasn't willing to pay for it but repeatedly playing it was implied to be cheaper. In other words it is going to cost a lot more to play a variety of music (not repeating the same songs) than it is to limit the playlist. ",
