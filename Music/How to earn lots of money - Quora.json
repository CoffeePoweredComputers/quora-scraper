            "answer_text": "Its a difficult question, there is a lot of possible answers\u2026 but for practical reasons im gonna focus in my personal experience (What i\u2019ve do and what i hear). And im not gonna say stuff like \u201cRead more, prepare yourself, be a good seller\u201d or stuff like that. Im going to show 3 practical examples: Be a broker of expensive stuff. Im not referring here just to things like Exotic Cars or Apartments with a view of central park. Im referring at any big transactions sell, for example, something dumb: Sell 10,000 office chairs. The path to do this is:A.Investigate about the big purchases of a company. B. Ask yourself \u00bfWhat the company complain about the actual supplier?C. Find a manufacturer of a similar or same product.D. Reach an agreement of costs or a commissioner scheme with the manufacturer. E. Try to fix the complain of the companyF. Introduce the new product with the pain solution for the company.G. Negotiate (Sell)H. Make the transaction I. Make moneyIf you are a broker you can settle a commission of 5% maybe (depend of the product) (1MUSD * .05 = 50,000)If you act like the manufacturer (This have some risks and maybe you are gonna need cash) you can make a gross profit of 10%\u201330% (1MUSD * .30 = 300,000)Some warnings about this:This is simple but not easy, its difficult to access to the info sometimes, and you gonna need some legal prep of course. The first transactions can be difficult, but im sure that if you try this at least for 6 months and you learn quickly, the next transactions come be easier.Develop a specific Skill. Maybe this is not the answer you are looking for, but maybe it fits here: The world its very complex with a lot of deferents needs. It can surprise you what hide jobs can be very well paid and nobody knows about it. For example, work in a tuna boat can give to you the chance of make $100,000 USD per year in a junior position (I think you need some prep for this job, but nothing compare with a university studies). Of course this is a high risky job and its not a walk in the park, but if the money is the only goal, try it out, you can make good money in this. (This is just an example, there are a lot of well paid jobs outside, just think about the jobs people don\u2019t want develop the skill they want and apply. )Invest in crapy companies. This is not an answer for everyone but if you already have the skills, you can make a lot of money in this. One time i was talking with a friend that is an investor and he give me one advise: \u201cIf you have the chance of invest in a good startup or a crapy traditional company, invest the second one\u201d\u2026 reasons: - The startup: it\u2019s not gonna make money in the short term, it depends a lot of market perception, and if they do one thing wrong, it\u2019s probably they fuckted up the entire company.- The crapy traditional: If the company isn\u2019t making money (Or maybe yes but below their competence) but is still alive they have the potential to be a grower company again, you don\u2019t need to start a new hole company, figure out what the problem is and solve it. Make some changes it sometimes can be easier and faster. Besides it can give to you a positive cashflow in the short and long term (that is better than paper profit).For all the options you are gonna need soft and hard skills, make sure you are developing the right ones. Im sure it pays, you just need to have focus and be disciplined. ",

            "answer_text": "Two rules: Start right now, now matter how young or old you are (time is an ally), and use the 8th wonder of the world: compounded interest. Start by saving 1% of your income, increase the sum to level where it's not an inconvenience and does not lower your current life quality too much. Everybody can save 1% and after realizing that, 2% becomes a possibility too, etc. I started this way and ended up saving about 50% of my income after realizing I can live without many things and small savings now can be ten or twenty times more in the future. That 4 EUR coffee could really cost you 80 EUR and after your thinking changes like this, you start spending to things you really need. My passive income (from compounded interest) became larger than my actual income first time almost 15 years ago. I did not start from exactly zero, since I had some savings left from business I did in late 80's and during the 90's, but compared to current wealth, that was peanuts.  How to get compounded interest? In many countries the yearly income is taxed every year, which may make things less easy. Where I life, mutual funds, ETFs that do not pay dividends and many other investments can be used for compounded interest, where the income increases your portfolio value without taxes and taxed are paid only after you sell your investments. The old golden rule for investments (from Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, thick book but worth reading anyway) was something like 40% domestic stocks and 60% in bonds. Current situation is that there is really no such thing as a domestic stock (unless you just count the currency used) and bond yields are so low it's hard to beat the inflation without resorting to high yield bonds, which in turn have very strong correlation to stock market (albeit slightly beforehand). That means you'll have to figure out a portfolio that you can keep for years to come and pay attention to the costs associated with the investments you're using. If a fund is taking 3% from top, after 20 or 30 years you have made your banker richer than you are. At first you can't start using most of the investment types just because your monthly or quarterly (or whatever you decide) increases to the portfolio are too small to quality, so most probably your best bet is a mutual fund or an ETF if you can buy them costs that are low enough. My personal limit for transaction costs was 0,25% (whether buying or selling) and if the cost was larger than that, either my transaction sum was too low or the investment target was charging too much. You should aim for diversification, which is also hard when starting, but you can get there after some time. Do not pick too many investments, because the benefits from diversification do not increase after 5-7 different investments. And you can't stay up to date with too many investments. Also do not buy anything you don't fully understand. Either study the thing enough or invest in things you do understand. I've never put my money in something I don't fully understand. Do not aim for quick route to riches, because that means also larger losses and in the worst case, can wipe you out. Don't use leveraging unless you really, really understand what you are doing. Same goes for options and structured products offered by banks. In every investment try to figure out what might be the maximum loss you are willing to take and how much is that compared to your whole portfolio. My maximum loss in every trade is calculated to be 1% of my portfolio, and my opinion is that yours should not be higher than that either. Know when to bend the rules. My largest transaction was worth over 70 million euros during the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash. Not a single one, but as many as I could enter before the market was halted and transactions were cancelled. The flash crash is an example of the mathematics and statistics behind investments that I'll talk a bit later. At that time I had 4 computers following the stock markets, currencies, commodities etc. 24/7. Remember that a loss is a loss. Not selling something that turns out to be a bad investment when the loss had reached your personal limit you have in your personal plan can be costly. That way that 10% loss can turn into 90% loss. Not selling at a loss is kidding yourself, you already have the loss. Cut your losses and let your profits run. Try the calculator at Compound Interest Calculator for checking out different scenarios for your investment future. You can see that even small amounts can lead to large wealth with enough time - like I said, time is your ally and that is why you should start saving now, if you don't figure out where, save to your savings account or similar. Also worth mentioning is that debt is in most cases your enemy. Debt is reasonable when you can use the money for increasing your wealth faster than the costs associated with the debt (mainly interest) is decreasing it. I have never had debt, unless short term deficits in my current accounts (I was trading in 5 different currencies). Many things that people call investments are not. Houses for example are not, in the long term. They bind your wealth to a single investment target that has large costs associated with it (repairs, heating, taxes, you name it). The only hope is that the price of the house goes up (it may, but there are better investments out there), but remember that in most cases you actually make the profit or loss when you are buying something, not when selling (at that point you already have whatever outcome came from the investment selected). The reason behind this logic is that you can decide the price at which you are buying something, but the market decides the price you can sell at (you can select only the time, but not the price). Buy low, sell high. I use credit cards every day. But I pay the debt back just before I have to start paying for interest, which means I have an average of 45 days of interest free OPM (other peoples' money). I life in a rented apartment, because buying and selling one is costly, the prices are not reflecting real values (I'm still expecting mean reversal after the interest rates start to increase, which is not happening very soon, but eventually). And the cost of the apartment would be so high that the alternatives are making better income to pay the rent (which is really not the case, since I'm not paying any taxes for any of my investments anymore - I use my regular salary for monthly expenses). Rented apartment means also that I'm mobile in case the situation changes where I live, I could change the city or the country in a few weeks. Don't start living like a millionaire even after you become one. You may find out later that you lose what you worked so hard for. Stay working and if you're not happy with what you're doing, find a better workplace. Never settle. Maintain your lifestyle by not investing too much and after your portfolio reaches level that is significant enough, try to look for good portfolio manager and alternative ways to manage wealth (which means you may have the possibility to avoid taxes, or lower then significantly - and you have access to many investment types the regular Joe does not). Now I have 110 people taking care of things I had to do myself before, so I have a lot more free time to do things I love, but still not live lavishly. I still have goals, but not sacrificing my life to reach them.  And please remember: don't try too hard, because a good enough plan you follow is much better than a very good plan you don't follow. And you should have a plan of some sort, so you have already thought of things and can react more quickly when situations happen. At least the stock market is not following normal distribution, so most of the economical theory is wrong. If you are good at math, you can figure out better equations for calculating the real risk associated with individual investments and the portfolio. You should also know (or at least have a good guess) or be able to calculate the correlations between different investments you have. Finally, I'd like to quote John Maynard Keynes (or A. Gary Shilling, I don't know). \"Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.\" Don't try to argue with the market. The prices may not reflect the true value of something at all times, but you don't get to buy at value and sell at a price, everything has only the bid and ask price and waiting for correction can cost you a lot - or in worst case everything. Good luck! I hope you find at least something of help in this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "8 tips to make lots of money  There is no recipe to become rich, but it is not a big secret either. Write down these tips and take advantage of the opportunities presented to you. It is safe to bet that more ink and paper have been spent on the subject of making more money than anything else. Who would have thought that basic things like food, transportation or a home would cost so much? We used to think of a millionaire as someone rich. Very soon that will be the level of poverty. So how do you get ahead and stay there with the costs increasing every day more? Surprisingly there is no secret to make lots of money. The problem is that people want it to be easy, like winning a lottery ticket, a magic formula so that everything fits in the right place to invest and become rich. Sorry to tell you this, but you must live in the real world, not in a fantasy. I share the way in which people usually earn money: 1. Start with nothing and grow in a rude neighborhood. Many successful people started with nothing and struggled every day of their lives to achieve it. Starbucks founder and CEO Howards Schultz grew not far from where I lived in Brooklyn. Competition and adversity make great leaders. 2. Do what you love and pray for a market for that. Steve Jobs said: \"The only way to do a good job is to love what you do. If you have not yet found, keep looking. Do not settle \"I was right, if you follow your passion and so do your customers, money will flow. 3. Follow the yellow road to Silicon Valley. The high tech industry has made a lot of money for many people, not just for the big executives. Why? Technology startups are the land of equity and opportunity. 4. Own your own business and live as a monk. Two-thirds of the millionaires work on their own. Most have small businesses with low budgets, they invest their money and, according to the book \"The millionaire next door\", they never received any kind of inheritance, do you really need a new car? 5. Take risks, make mistakes and trust your instincts. Many people take big risks, some smart, some silly things they should not take. Trust your instinct and act intelligently. You'll be wrong many times, but that's fine. No one won by going to safety. 6. Work as never before and make many sacrifices. It's not a question of getting enslaved, but take into account that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is a workaholic since she is in the office for about 90 hours a week. The same Elon Musk, has two companies and does not know how to delegate and let's not forget Steve Jobs when he had Apple and Pixar at the same time. 7. Create your own luck. They say that luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Even though I was very lucky, I never stopped looking for opportunities when I saw a pinch of possibility. My advice: let's tweet and go out to the real world to do networking. 8. Diversify, diversify, diversify. The idea of old age is so certain that it is not fun. I have an old friend, whose investment strategy has always been to put their money in as many different places as possible. It takes time and effort but the pay is incredible. Save your money, invest wisely and diversify. You can always call yourself a social networking entrepreneur or a CEO who generates all kinds of free content while the people of Facebook and Google become rich. The truth is that no one got anywhere doing what others did. It would be the same if you compare a lottery ticket and pray for a miracle. ",

            "answer_text": " Nicolas Cole Instagram There\u2019s an old saying in business that instructs, \u201cYou don\u2019t get paid what you deserve. You get paid what you negotiate.\u201d I believe that wholeheartedly. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned that no matter how hard you work, working hard has little correlation to how much you earn\u200a\u2014\u200aor more importantly, what others around you believe you\u2019re worth. Earning potential is related to one thing and one thing only: The value of what it is you do. Let me give you a few business examples: What is the value of someone who can scrub toilets?What is the value of someone who can neatly organize an office?What is the value of someone who can get people to sign up for your service?What is the value of someone who can provide assistance in a medical emergency?In society, we place dollar amounts on everyday tasks, and then offer payment to one another based on who can achieve the desired outcome\u200a\u2014\u200arelated back, of course, to supply and demand. Lots of people can scrub toilets. Not many people can perform emergency surgery. So, what does this mean for your own earning potential? How do you know if you\u2019re being paid too little\u200a\u2014\u200aand more importantly, how can you increase your value to the point where you are earning more than is considered \u201cnormal\u201d for your responsibilities? Here\u2019s how: 1. Do your research and learn what is most valuable about your role. Every industry has fairly established roles, and every role has its own list of responsibilities. If you want to earn more for yourself, do your homework and learn what it is about your role in particular that is valuable\u200a\u2014\u200aand then look for all the different parties that are willing to pay for that role, and in what context. Let me give you an example. I studied creative writing in college. Do you know how many people told me studying creative writing would fast-track me to a minimum wage job? Not very many people make a decent living writing. So, I did my homework. I asked myself, \u201cWho needs a good writer? What would my value potentially be to them?\u201d Turns out, CEOs with powerful messages often struggle to tackle a blank page. I\u2019ve built a company off my ability to write and tell personal stories. But that wouldn\u2019t have happened, had I not done my homework. 2. Give up short-term raises for long-term jackpots. For four years, I didn\u2019t make a cent off my writing. I did everything for free. If someone well-known needed a writer, I jumped at the opportunity. If a startup needed a copywriter, I took on the challenge. I wrote every day on Quora for free. I wrote guest blogs for free. And then once I had proven myself and my abilities, once I had 50,000 followers, once I had thousands of people on my email list, once I had been republished in every major publication on the Internet, it all happened on its own. This is the biggest piece of advice I have for anyone who wants to increase their earning potential. Forget the small raises. Forget the, \u201cHey so I\u2019m going to need you to pay me for the extra hour I spent on this project.\u201d Forget it all. Instead of asking for that hour paid, ask for an introduction to someone else. Ladder up your success to the next project, and the next project. Work with bigger and bigger people, for free. Master for craft. And before you know it, you will be at the top of the pyramid. 3. Don\u2019t just tell people why they should pay you more. Show them. I am a huge advocate for personal branding. And what I mean when I say personal branding is representing yourself on the Internet in a way that speaks volumes about who you are and what you do. If you Google my name, my website is the number one search result. The second search result is my About page. In fact, the entire first three pages on Google, I own\u200a\u2014\u200awith my website, my columns, podcast features, and my social media accounts. My social headers, I had designed. My photos, I update regularly. I write a new article somewhere, every single day. All of these things make it very, very easy for someone to look me up, sit back, and think, \u201cHmmm, I should work with this guy.\u201d I get about 20 inbound leads per day via email, solely because of my personal brand. No ads. No PR. Nothing else. Which is why I balk at the people who talk and talk and talk about how great they are, meanwhile they\u2019re practically invisible on the Internet. Everything they do is outdated. They don\u2019t share any content that proves they walk the walk. From all the way over here, in front of my laptop, how am I supposed to know they\u2019re someone worth working with? Stop telling. Start showing. And I don\u2019t just mean entrepreneurs. If you are an employee of a company, you will get paid more if you have a strong personal brand. 4. \u201cYou can\u2019t rationalize with the customer.\u201d This is something I heard a mentor of mine say over and over again, and it continues to play in my head constantly. The moment you start trying to justify what it is you do and the value you provide by focusing on all the nitty-gritty things, you\u2019ve lost. Sure, you might win their business in the end, but it\u2019s not the win you\u2019re going to want. Rationalizing with people only devalues what it is you do. You have to show them the vision. You have to get them to see emotional impact. This is what people do when I tell them what I charge as a writer. They say, \u201cThat\u2019s absurd, I could hire a copywriter for $25 an hour on Craigslist. I pay someone five cents per word.\u201d Yes. You absolutely could. And what you would get back is a bunch of words on a page, fulfilling your rationalized expectation. What you won\u2019t get is the conviction, the voice, the tone you want representing you and everything you do. What you won\u2019t get is someone emailing you after saying, \u201cI was extremely impressed with the piece you just published today.\u201d Rationalizing with the customer would be, in this example, focusing on how much they are paying per word or per piece. I don\u2019t rationalize. I show them the real value I am providing, which always focuses on a desired outcome. 5. Ask. It\u2019s amazing to me how many people complain about their current situation, but never ask for a different result. It\u2019s a very, very rare thing for an employer or a client to wake up one morning, call you up (or bring you into their office), sit you down and say, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m going to pay you more.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t happen that way. Like I said at the start of this article: people don\u2019t earn what they deserve, they earn what they negotiate. If you feel you deserve to be paid more, in whatever context you are working in, it\u2019s your responsibility to ask. You have to bring it up with your employer. You have to bring it to the attention of your client. And most importantly, you have to be prepared for them to say, \u201cNo,\u201d and to then explain what value you provide that warrants an increase in your earnings.

            "answer_text": "Question: Do porn stars make a lot of money? It depends. The CNBC article quoted in another answer is three years old and only accounts for known performers who spend most or all of their time in and around the Southern California hub of the American porno industry. Since that time, porn has become more decentralized and more international, with private cam shows making up a sizable portion of the market. Most porn performers aren\u2019t going to make their living from their film roles. Most are going to earn the money from: Personal appearancesPrivate showsAdult dancingEscortingPersonal giftsWhile they don\u2019t have the cachet that a major Hollywood performer might have, there are places where an adult film performer can appear for a set fee and be paid a sizable sum. Additionally, all of the performers of consequence have their own websites and management who can book private shows for them with clients. How much they would be paid for those private appearances depends upon the client\u2019s pocketbook and the manager\u2019s negotiating skills. Stormy Daniels (of Donald Trump fame) has made an exceptional amount of money performing at various adult dancing venues around the United States. I you travel to \u201cstripping destinations\u201d like Las Vegas and Florida, you can often find major name porn performers being paid to perform shows at adult venues. Again, how much they earn depends upon their ability draw in customer and the negotiation ability of the people who make their bookings. Some adult film stars act as escorts. Since this is illegal and done discreetly, what they earn depends upon what they are able to charge and who they re able to collect. Some performers don\u2019t care to do this; some do it more often than they make adult films. Since again it\u2019s illegal in the United States, you are unlikely to get a true accounting of what is earned by the performers. Personal gifts are often given to performers by admirers. There are several sites online where a porn performers put a link to their Amazon or other sites \u201cwish list\u201d, with the apparent expectation that one or more of their \u201cfans\u201d will purchase the highlighted items for them. Since the items range in value from a few hundred to thousands of dollars (especially gift cards), the performers can easily earn as much as they would from performing just from personal \u201cgratuities\u201d. So it\u2019s nearly impossible to say what adult film performers earn annually, questioner. It depends upon what they are willing to do and where they are willing to go. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to start making money fast is to get some quick wins. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 1. Take Paid Surveys Websites like Survey Junkie will pay you a decent chunk of change for the low-maintenance, borderline mindless task of completing surveys. Companies want to understand consumers better, and one way they do that is by compensating survey-takers. Most surveys pay between $0.50 and $1.25, and many of them take less than 5 minutes to do. You can read our full Survey Junkie review for more info. Survey Junkie adds new surveys every day, which means you can make money faster than you think. 2. Deliver with Postmates Postmates\u2019 slogan is simple: \u201cAnything, anytime, anywhere. We get it.\u201d As a delivery driver for Postmates, you\u2019ll get paid to deliver things like groceries, take out, and even alcohol (which is a genius business idea, by the way). There are no fees or time commitments, so you have complete freedom over when you want to work. You\u2019ll take home 100% of what you earn every time you complete a delivery, and you\u2019ll be able to see an exact breakdown of how your commissions are calculated. 3. Get $10 from Swagbucks Swagbucks is another great survey site to make money fast. It\u2019s similar to Survey Junkie, but there are also a few other ways you can earn money as a member (including a $10 bonus just for signing up). Other ways you can earn with Swagbucks outside of surveys: Cash back program for internet shopping (includes $10 bonus).Get paid for searching the web (includes $10 bonus)Watching videos (includes $10 bonus)4. Get a Free $300 Bonus as a New Lyft Driver If you\u2019ve got some free time and don\u2019t live in the middle of nowhere, becoming a Lyft driver can be a very lucrative side hustle that allows you make money fast. And right now, they\u2019ve got a promotion going on where any new driver will instantly get a $300 bonus after completing their 100th ride. If you start now and hustle hard on the weekends, you can probably unlock that bonus within a few weeks of driving (and that\u2019s in addition to your normal earnings). 5. Download the Nielsen App (and Collect $50) Have you heard of Nielsen, the company that tracks TV ratings? Turns out they collect data on a lot more than just TV. One area they\u2019re really into is internet usage research. What does that mean for you? It means Nielsen will pay you $50 a year to keep their app on your favorite internet browsing device. The app itself collects statistics on your internet usage anonymously, so you never have to worry about any data being linked to you. And the best part is, the app takes up barely any space and doesn\u2019t slow down your phone or tablet at all! Let's know something more about making money online. ",

            "answer_text": "By not losing it. Edit: Apologies for the curt answer. Here's something more rounded.  RiskMy personal view is that there is no such thing as one magic bullet that is \"the most effective\" asset class or vehicle for everyone. This is akin to asking \"what is the most effective way to get home from work?\" While the question seems simple, it depends on number of variables such as available options, traffic, risks etc.  It's the same thing for investing. Without knowing the situation you are in, it is really hard to answer what \"the most effective way\" is. At the most basic level, clarification around what your goal is and what your time horizon is in achieving this goal, and how important it is for you to achieve the goal, is required. In addition, it's necessary to know what kind of psychological biases you are influenced by because couple bad decisions can erase every last cent you earn over decades. This is the reason why I said \"by not losing it\". Step 1, which applies to everyone that wants to grow money, is making sure that whatever action they take, they have as close to 0% risk of ruin as they are comfortable.  This sounds obvious, but many smart people (Isaac Newton went broke investing in South Sea and Long Term Capital Management had more than one Nobel Laureates working for them) lose their entire life savings every year because they go for extra 1% yield without thinking about the risks they are taking. We are terrible at eyeballing risk. This is also why it's important that you have realistic expectations about what sort of returns are not possible without significant risks. (If you are OK with gambling away life savings to get max returns, that's OK too, as long as you are aware) Growing moneyI can point out that historically, (except for the last 10 years) equities have generally outperformed bonds, and that active managers, as a group, have underperformed the broad index, mostly due to fees and other frictional costs. Gold has been on a tear for the last 10 years by comparison and has outperformed a lot of other asset classes. But this doesn't tell you anything.  In investing, price you pay today matters more than what happened historically. if you invested at the peak of the dot com bubble, history would have told you that you should expect fantastic returns. Over the following 10 years, you would have made less than 0.  So, what is the \"most effective way\" to grow money? Pay as little as possible for  a future stream of cash flow. This works in any asset classes. Investing means putting money down for promise of money tomorrow. The \"best\" way, therefore, is to put as little of it down as possible.  Since \"guaranteed\" cash flow streams are well defined and trusted by the market, these instruments will usually not give you high enough returns to satisfy your goals. (If they do, hurray!) To get extra returns, you will usually have to go into asset classes where the stream is an estimate.  The goal then, is to find a class of investment where you feel that you can estimate this future stream better than anyone else out there. This \"vehicle\" shouldn't be defined in the traditional sense (by equity/bond/options, or by industry) - it should be specific situations. (are you good at timing corporate turnarounds? knowing when the market sentiment will turn on a specific few stocks? figuring out liquidation value of a hard to value asset?)  Since you are better at estimating these cashflows vs other people, you can recognize the bargains more easily vs others and take advantage of it.  It goes without saying, this requires significant amount of work. If you are not willing to put in the time, forget about everything I said and put truly long term savings (ones where you won't need them for 10-30 years) into low cost, broad market index (assuming you are not an accredited investor, in which case more options open up for you). Trying to earn extra few points in the market without doing the full back work is similar to stepping on the gas pedal to get home faster when you are drunk driving.     Hope that helped. Investing is where execution matters. If everything I said above sounds way too obvious and easy, let me assure you - implementing everything every time you make a decision will not be easy. ",

            "answer_text": "There is really only one tried and tested way to grow your wealth; spend less than you make and invest the surplus wisely. No matter how much you scale your income, you will never scale your wealth if you don\u2019t get that right.  You get into the \u201cperfect zone\u201d when: Your income is going upYour spending habits are stagnant or going up with inflationYou are investing rightSounds too good to be true? Think about this. Most of us here are probably making 2x-10x more than we were at age 22, in our first job after university. We were probably just as happy now as then. We probably weren\u2019t living off rice then either. However, over time, our wants can go up. That is what lifestyle inflation is all about. It is the biggest reason why you see business owners, lawyers, bankers and others making 300k, 500k or even over $1m and are broke. So the key is scaling both your income and your wealth at the same time. The easiest way to do that is: Get good at your job or business. That comes with experience. Then start your own business, not the other way aroundUse online to scale your income as a business owner or even freelancer. Or use online to get a second incomeDon\u2019t let lifestyle inflation affect your finances. Just increase your spending in line with inflation or at most inflation +2% or inflation +3% if you are doing really well. That way you can gradually consume more but it is sustainable if you are earning more.Invest for the long-term. In low-cost and long-term orientated investmentsPlay the numbers game. It might take executing 100 ideas for 5 to monetizeIdeas don\u2019t count. Execute does.Take calculated risksAlso be open-minded when taking risk. Many people \u201ctalk themselves out of opportunities\u201d. I have lost count of the number of people that have said things like \u201cI can\u2019t scale online. Only face-to-face works in my industry\u201d. Clearly nonsense but it is confirmation bias at work. The reason why focusing on the three elements of wealth is so powerful, is it all compounds. Simple example. Let\u2019s say you have started your own business, after spending years getting good at your job. In the first few years you make 60k a year after tax. You invest 5k a year. You are comfortable but not setting the world on fire. Then you earn 200k after tax once your business really starts to catch dire, due to scaling online and playing the numbers game. However, you don\u2019t increase your spending much. Maybe only too 60k. Now you have a 140k yearly surplus to invest - which will further compound your future income. If you just spend the extra 140k you have just scaled your income but not your wealth. I have lost count of the numbers of founders that have struggled for years, only to start making really good money, sometimes in low-cost cities and countries, who just waste the money. Then when business is down again 5\u201310 years later, they are broke, when they could have become millionaires if they would have fixed the roof when the sun was shining.

            "answer_text": "Let me do something original and review some of the advice offered by other folks here. I do this with much respect and gratitude, so dear answer writers, please don\u2019t take it personally! You do NOT need to sacrifice most of your waking hours. Choose a business you\u2019ll love doing and work becomes play (but it\u2019s more like a sport, so it can be intense).Work smarter not harder. Yes, you can use Autohotkey to automate a lot of computer-related tasks.Yes, simplify your business model. Once you have a proven/superior product, focus on 1. generating leads every week, 2. converting leads into paying customers, and 3. delivering the product. Can\u2019t get simpler.Yes, you gotta earn it, but you can ALSO \u201csteal\u201d the work of others on the Web. Ethically, that is. Reverse engineer the successful landing pages or email marketing campaigns, etc. On the Web, you can see most of what your competitors are doing. Don\u2019t hesitate to borrow from their playbook!There IS such a thing as a free lunch, since so much free information (a lot of PDF documents, templates, blueprints, etc.) is now available on the Web.Life IS fair. Furthermore, success in making money is almost about mathematics. It\u2019s a numbers game (after you\u2019ve created a good, proven, in-demand product).Okay, my turn to provide an answer. If you equate \u201cmaking tons of money\u201d with \u201cwinning tons of chess games\u201d, then what you need is an AI that tells you, based on your present situation, all the moves you must make \u2014 now and in the future, at specific dates. I am developing this artificial business intelligence (ABI) right now. But like a chess computer, it can only recommend the right move(s) for you if it knows what your situation is right now. You could have 100+ people provide the smartest answers to your question, yet it would not help because all these moves must be made in the right order. So my recommendation to you is to ask more questions like this one, but provide specific details about your situation. Smart people can then analyze properly and recommend exactly the few moves you need to make asap in order to embark on the journey to wealth! ",

            "answer_text": "You won\u2019t be able to make \u201cLots of money\u201d. But first a quick warning: always (always) be skeptical about people who tell you in details how they make $X in Y days and how you could do the same. Always think about the motivation behind it - and you\u2019ll see that most of the time you are just being sold something or used for something. Just think about it: if they could make a lot of money fast - then, if it were still possible to do, why wouldn\u2019t they be doing it themselves? Now back to \u201clots of money\u201d and why you won\u2019t be able to make it: It\u2019s just too abstract to be meaningful. It\u2019s really hard to get what you want if you really don\u2019t quite know what you want. So, start with understanding of what \u201clots of money\u201d means for you. Is it $2,000 of passive income per month?Is it one-off opportunity to make $50K - something that can work once and will be too hard to replicate?Is it $1M in your banking account by the age of 60? Or by 50? 40? 30?Are you talking about becoming a billionaire?Different \u201clots of money\u201d call for completely different methods. For example, both a million and a billion can be considered \u201clots of money\u201d by most. But the path to making a million is very different from the path to making a billion. After you decide HOW MUCH is \u201clots of money\u201d for you and HOW FAST you want it, use the following framework to think about how to get it (I\u2019ll keep lottery and gambling out of it).  You make money by generating value for somebody and, as a reward, you claim part of that value. If you work for a company, you generate the value for your employer, and you claim part of it as your paycheck. Your employer generates value for his/her clients and claims part of it as the company\u2019s revenues which is used to pay salaries. So, to make a lot of money you need to be able to generate a lot of value for somebody. And generating a lot of value is super hard. Sorry, no shortcuts here. The stories about getting rich from doing nothing are usually written for gullible people by those who make money for writing those stories. From there you can start thinking about the business.  Observe people around you (whether it\u2019s your bosses at work on your co-workers or your friends and family) and see what could make their life better, easier, more fun, etc. We all value those things so giving us more of them would be valuable for us. Bring lots of value at once to one client and claim a high reward (usually in B2B models) or lots of value over time to millions of clients (usually in B2C models) or anything in-between But what do people want and how do I give it to them faster, cheaper, better than others like me? Welcome to the club! We are all in the same boat on this one. I used to think how to deliver more value to my employer\u2026 and now, being my own employer myself, I\u2019m thinking about how to deliver the most value to my clients, so I can claim part of it as a reward. I know this one is unpopular proposition that requires lots of time and effort, but this is the one that consistently works. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": " THE ROADMAP TO $1,000,000 This is from the book, One Million in the Bank: How To Make $1,000,000 With Your Own Business, Even If You Have No Money Or Experience. Here\u2019s the eight-step process I\u2019ve discovered through trial and error, experience, and observation. Step 1: Really believe you can do it (or fake it \u2018til you make it) and take action on that belief Don\u2019t concentrate on your passions. Instead, focus on economics, logistics, and a business you can execute. Then, firmly make the decision to start a business. Nothing else matters until you get serious about putting $1,000,000 in the bank. Without that upfront commitment, you\u2019ll do everything half-heartedly. With that commitment, though, you\u2019ll find ways to make everything else happen. Step 2: Research your business Use the internet to research the kind of company you want to start. Go to your local SBDC (Small Business Development Center) or SCORE (formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives) office and ask for help. Find other business owners outside of your market and ask them for advice. Find out everything you can before you waste your time and money learning the hard way. Keep in mind: \u00b7 You do not need a new and innovative idea \u00b7 Start with a profitable, tried and true business \u00b7 Seek out all material available, including online resources and as many books and other materials as you can lay your hands on \u00b7 Ask business owners about the type of business you are considering Step 3: Learn the business skills Many people go into business for themselves to leverage an industry-specific skill set. When I started my company, I simply transferred my experience from my former employer. It makes sense. But the technical skills are only half of the business and, frankly, the less important one. The critical half is being able to manage the business itself. You need to know how to manage your cash flow, how to hire and fire personnel, how to market, and such basics as it takes to run a business. To fill your skill gaps, go to SBDC, SCORE, and other sources of mentors and educational classes. Plus you should look for free advice to increase your skills in any other way possible. Step 4: Start writing a business plan You should be working on your plan from Day 1, but you don\u2019t need to complete it before you begin acting on it. Regardless of how you use it or with whom you share it, write it for yourself first. It is a tool to help you get all your ideas out of your head and organized in black and white. Starting a business plan puts you in action and helps you solidify your thoughts. Step 5: Find the money If you\u2019ve done your homework and have a solid plan, I promise you\u2014the money\u2019s out there. Start looking for contacts and potential investors as soon as you decide to start a business. You could also consider bootstrapping on your own. Whatever you do, look at different possible options, including a loan or selling equity in your business to investors. Money is everywhere. I\u2019ve found investors for my other companies in such mundane places as elevators and even a waiting room at a car wash. Your vendors may front you the equipment, you could pre-sell memberships to your customers, or you could begin your business in a free space (like a fitness trainer teaching classes in a public park) and pay as you go. Step 6: Execute Most of the successful entrepreneurs I\u2019ve met did something similar to the steps laid out above. Most of the business failures I\u2019ve spoken to did little research, were ill-prepared, and sought advice from almost no one. The best approach is to have a solid plan thoroughly researched before you start and to set down all your operating procedures and policies (i.e., start an operating manual to help you consistently execute day-to-day operations). Step 7: Scale Consider having more locations and more products, leveraging the internet, franchising your company, or a combination of these. In the beginning, you may have to do it all, but as you scale up, always be working toward building a business in which you are not required for day-to-day operations. Strive to make it a system that anyone could step into and immediately be running the business. You don\u2019t want to create yet another job for yourself. You want to create a business that can function without you. Step 8: Have an exit strategy Even if you don\u2019t foresee yourself selling your business anytime soon, stay organized and keep good records as you build your company so you can easily sell it if you need to. Until then, keep it running and enjoy the profit. Keep in mind that many of these steps will naturally overlap, but all must be addressed. If you look at this list and say it\u2019s too easy, you\u2019d be right and wrong. Everyday businesses are not rocket science. It doesn\u2019t take a Ph.D. in management to run a soccer retail store or even a multi-million-dollar company with multiple locations. That\u2019s the great thing about running a small business\u2014with the right prep work, just about anybody can do it. ",

            "answer_text": "The age old question :) Lot\u2019s of great answers here in this thread. This is a question that I am currently in the process of answering for my self. I write about it on my blog which is a live case study of my journey to \u2018earning lots of money\u2019 or as I prefer to refer to it; \u2018being financially independent so that i can live life on my terms\u2019. You can check it and connect with me here IncomeObjective.com There are a few important things I have learnt on my journey so far which I will share with you to try and answer your question. First off earning lots of money is possible, but it\u2019s not always easy. It will take time, effort, consistent action and the ability to accept the downs with the ups. Working on your mindset on daily basis is really helpful in achieving this and something that most people who are successful in this area likely do. I can not stress the importance of this. So many people think making money can be easy and effortless, and most of the people with that mindset tend to fail. I am not denying that there are people out there who do make money easy ans effortlessly, but that has only come after years of hard work, failures and real dedication. Sorry, not always the news people like to hear, but I don\u2019t feel I would be being honest to just ignore this point. Secondly (and this is much better news!) success leaves clues. This is also super important. If you\u2019re anything like me, when people say \u2018you just need to create a product or service that people need but don\u2019t have\u2019 you groan in disappointment thinking how hard that is. Sound familiar?  Well don\u2019t despair! Have you ever the saying \u2018no need to reinvent the wheel\u2019? What I am trying to get at is that there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money just copying what other people have done, and you can do this too. Find successful people who are making money in something that interests you and copy them. Obviously do not copy them exactly, but take their business model and their idea and put your own spin on. They are successful because the business model they are using works. So it can work for you too. For more information on this visit my blog and read posts such as \u2018how to make money blogging\u2019 \u2018how to find a profitable niche market\u2019 \u2018digital Vs physical products\u2019 and \u2018how to build a website\u2019 The great thing about the internet is that it has created money making opportunities in abundance and I would highly recommend this as a great place to start. Even if you don\u2019t feel comfortable copying someone\u2019s idea and putting you\u2019re own twist on it at this stage, there are plenty of opportunities to sell other peoples products for them. Read my blog post \u2018what is the easiest way to make money online?\u2019 to find out more. Ultimately which ever path you chose to take in making money, you need to have the right mindset and the determination to do it. If it was that easy, everyone would be rich right? Take care and let me know how you\u2019re getting on :) ",

            "answer_text": "I do not believe in all the advertisement that promise to make you rich within a short time. That\u2019s because I saw many different ways in which people create money on the web. So to be sure I would never start using them because in the end somebody else will be the one that will make money, otherwise the advertisement wouldn\u2019t exist. This is just one of the ways to create money by selling people a concept that might not really exist. If you want to generate something that makes money it must be something people think they need. I would say think, because there are more and more services available through our computer and smartphones and also in real life with all the services you can use that might not be really necessary. But to get back to the question, there are 3 ways for finding an idea  You take something that already exists We all know, there are so many equal products out there. You can choose one product with maybe a very tiny specification from many different companies. This is because- different people have different ideas of a product, specifications- a product can be copied in many ways, maybe different designExamplesProducts: Smartphones, PCs, Computer Peripherie, Food StoresServices: Apps, Websites, every kind of software  You create something that doesn\u2019t already existI think, it is something that many people think of! Creating something, that nobody else created before. Anything unique. But people mostly never reach the point to create this desired product because they do not focus on the important things. I just watched an interview with Jonathan Ive (designer) about lessons that he learned from Steve Jobs. The first lesson is focusing. Watch this short video![1]From what I learned with the time and also from books I read, focus is a very important thing. Focusing means to imply ideas from different fields of your life and connect them to find anything new. To do this, you first of all need to know different things. You need to have an understanding for many different things and furthermore, know how these things work in detail. Then you will start to connect your ideas better, and creating new concepts.I once read a book about creativity. It was very short and simple. In one part the author explained that knowledge/intelligence has 3 different stepsStep 1: Learning patterns that exist and creating a map of your abilities Step 2: Combining 2 or more patterns that you learned beforeStep 3: Creating new patterns All steps can lead to a new product that you can sell. The higher you reach - the more unique is your product- the more you will earnCreativity is all that matters!If I will check the title of the book and add it soon!ExamplesA very good example are Mobile Applications! SOMEBODY just had this great idea of reinventing Applications that we already used for many centuries and changed the name, he called it \u201cAPP\u201d!Steve Jobs invented the way how applications have been distributed. It created a place where everybody meets, the devs and the customers. Everything works totally easy ( except for the app developers :) ) and customers do not have to search for software because they know this one place where they get everything. Of course, if you are a heavy user, you won\u2019t get happy with the App Store because you won\u2019t find always everything but for the majority this was a revolution!Footnotes[1] Apple's Jony Ive on the Lessons He Learned From Steve Jobs",

            "answer_text": "The only way you can earn more money is by increasing the value (or perceived value) that you bring to the marketplace. Period. Everything that you do to earn more money will abide by this rule. If you negotiate a raise, you earn that raise because you helped your boss realize the value that you\u2019re bringing to the company. If you sell more products it\u2019s because you increased the value of those products or leveraged smart marketing tactics to increase the perceived value of those products. Anything and everything that you do to increase your money must start from a place of increasing your value to the marketplace. So how do you actually go about doing this? While there are 1,000,000 and 1 ways you can become more valuable, these are the 3 best that I\u2019ve found after building a 7-figure business. Enjoy.  1. Increase Your Productivity (The Speed with Which You Provide Value) The first way that you can earn more money is by increasing your ability to get sh*t done and provide value at a faster speed. Think about it this way\u2026 Imagine there are two people who are equally skilled at their job as creative writers. The first writer can write 1,000 words in 60 minutes. The second writer can write 2,500 words in 60 minutes. Who do you think will be more highly paid? Who do you think will get promoted? Obviously, the writer who can get twice as much work done in the same amount of time (this is especially true if you\u2019re a freelancer or entrepreneur). Therefore, one of the best ways to get paid more is to increase your output by leveraging proven productivity tactics. I\u2019ve written extensively about productivity here on Quora I\u2019ll summarize my best points here: Sleep 8 hours a nightWorkout for 30 minutes a dayEat a whole foods diet80/20 your tasksEliminate all distractionsWork on a 50 minute timer and take a 10 minute break after it\u2019s overPlan your days the night beforeMeditate for at least 10 minutes a dayOutsource all low level workChange your work environment regularlyTake plenty of breaks and 2\u20133 days off a weekImplementing the above tips can help you increase your productivity by 50% or more. And once you are able to get more done in less time than your competitors or coworkers, you WILL start making more money. 2. Increase Your Skills (The Level of Value You Bring) Once you are able to get more done in less time, you\u2019ll want to find ways that you can get more done while simultaneously increasing the quality of the work that you\u2019re accomplishing. To do this, you will need to adhere to three simple principles. The Law of 1% and Intentional Practice: If you diligently work on your craft for only 1 hour a day and consciously IMPROVE by 1% each day you will be 365% better at your career/business in a year. That\u2019s a HUGE leap.The Power of Education: In addition to improving your craft by 1% everyday, you must constantly seek out new and applicable knowledge that will help you get better at what you are doing. Read books, buy online courses, attend seminars. Do anything and everything you can to learn more about your skill set. If you learn one thing a month that improves how you work by 10% you\u2019ve now added an additional 120% improvement on top of the existing 365%~The Power of Coaching: The best in the world ALL have coaches to help them identify their weaknesses and optimize their strengths. Whatever your current career path, you need a coach to help you go from good to great. I once hired a sales coach who helped me go from $8,000/month to more than $30,000/month in under a year. It just plain works.When you commit to the process, educate yourself massively on your chosen field, and hire coaches to help you identify and eliminate your weaknesses, you will quickly rise to the top of your field and be able to demand any price that you want. 3. Increase Your Status (The Perceived Value of Working with You) Have you ever watched Dr. Phil? He\u2019s a marriage counselor, author, and TV personality with an estimated networth of about $400 million. An hour of counseling with Dr. Phil will run you\u2026 Oh, just a measly $40,000! Now let me ask you a question\u2026 The average marriage counselor charges between $75 and $150 an hour. That\u2019s less than 10% of what it would cost you to work with Dr. Phil. But do you really think that Dr. Phil is 400x better than other marriage counselors? OF COURSE NOT! He might be good, but I promise he\u2019s not that good. So how can he charge such an outrageous price? Simple\u2026 Because he\u2019s increased his perceived status. (or value). And if you want to make more money, you must do the same thing. People want to work with high status people. Period. If you can increase your status by becoming a best selling author, driving a nicer car (e.g. Tai Lopez), setting public speaking engagements, and becoming a prolific creator on all major channels, then you can charge pretty much whatever you want. Not because you\u2019re better than everyone else. But because the general public perceives your value to be greater than your competitors. You can start small here. Upgrade your wardrobe, create more content and get it published on major blogs, write a book on Amazon, do small things that make you seem more high status. Eventually, you will reach a point where you never have to look for money again and you\u2019ll have more business and opportunities than you know what to do with falling right into your lap.

            "answer_text": "What is your personal financial strategy? If you ask this question a few years ago, surely someone will laugh at you: \"Sleep on it.\" This is absolutely an unwise step. If you don't have a personal financial strategy, you'll never get rich. An average young person will earn about 40,000-50,000 USD per year and must spend 20,000-40,000 USD to pay student debt. However, there are also people who earn 7 times the amount above. When you realize this, you need a more serious attitude about money. However, don't focus too much on making money. This is a mistake that many of us often make. We think that money is the solution to everything. This is not right. The difference between people who earn a lot and those who earn less is great. And I think this difference expresses in some things the following:  1.Don't crave too much Everyone knows one thing - making money is more time consuming than spending money. You have to work thousands of hours to create a certain amount of money. After that, you spend them on a new car, a holiday break, a watch, or anything you crave. We all know this. However, you still spend money like water. This may be an old advice, but the easiest way to increase your income is not to spend all your money. This advice makes sense, because, for freedom, you need to reduce your needs. 2. Understand how the economy works When do interest rates often rise? When does it come down? What are bonds? What is inflation? What is the market cycle? What is debt? Why do they print money? There are many other questions, but you probably understand what the problem is. You don't have to be an economist, but you should also learn about economics, by reading books like Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street of Burton Malkiel's . This is a great summary of how the economy works as well as the investment process. The problem is, this economic knowledge will help you avoid panic. \"Oh no! The market collapsed! What should I do now?\" Panic will not help you at all. 3. Limit personal debt Borrowing is not bad, but personal debt can ruin your entire fortune. If you want to start a business or develop a large real estate project, you will have to borrow money. However, borrowing money also needs wisdom. Like investment, it also has certain rules. However, one thing is for sure, never borrow money to buy a car, electronics, or anything that can wear out in value. If the loan involves the establishment and development of a company, real estate investment, or education, you must think carefully before doing so. Remember, borrowing money is not free. 4. Save as much as you can Your financial strategy may depend on your age, personality, location, education, experience, etc. People living in Manhattan can hardly afford an apartment. It's too expensive, so renting is a wiser choice. However, it would be more reasonable to buy a home in a city with low real estate prices. In that case, the rent will be much more expensive. Whatever you do, you need to make sure you have enough cash to invest when the opportunity arises. So how much is saving? This depends on you. Choose a number that you feel most comfortable with.  5. Short-term strategies We are long-term investors, not to make money one day or two day. But we also need a daily income to pay for bills. So what should we do? The answer is short-term strategy. Short-term financial strategies can be based on fostering skills and creating different sources of income. You should also invest in education, because the more skills you have, the more money you will earn. In addition, don't rely too much on a single salary. Instead, look for ways to generate income. This will minimize risks. If a source of your income disappears, you will still have other things. It is true that you need a lot of different sources of income, but before you do that, focus on the number of assets you have and improve your skills. The most important question you can ask yourself is: Can I create wealth? If the answer is no, you need to make it available, and consider it your top priority. Find out what successful people have done. You can also read books, research investors, experiment, talk to rich people, ...When you find a way to increase your income instead of spending it, that's when your property value increases. ",

            "answer_text": "For the amount of time I spend, I think I earn a pretty good amount of money re-skinning apps. Last year I was able to make over $15,000 working just 1 hour per week and this past January I was able to make $6,199 working just 2\u20133 hours per week. As you can see, you don\u2019t need much of a time commitment to do this and there isn\u2019t much technical knowledge you need either. Re-skinning apps is a pretty simple process. Basically, you purchase/create a template, change the graphics of the template, and then sell the app. The entire process will take between 1 and 3 hours depending on your experience. After having re-skinned apps for over a year now, I\u2019ve found that the typical re-skinned app sells for between $100 and $300. However, I\u2019ve had single re-skins that have sold for over $2,000! That\u2019s a lot of money for an app that took just 1\u20132 hours to make! If re-skinning sounds like something you want to try, I would first recommend looking at Chupamobile. Chupamobile is a marketplace to buy app templates. They usually cost between $50 and $250. However, once you buy a template once, you can re-skin it an unlimited amount of times! After you decided on your first template, you\u2019re going to need to re-skin the app. I\u2019ve found that simplicity is the best when re-skinning apps. I typically just change the icon, colors, screenshots, text, and backgrounds of the app. I wouldn\u2019t try to add features because this is time consuming and the return isn\u2019t usually that great. After completing the re-skin, you\u2019re almost finished with your first app! Now you just have to sell it on Flippa, a marketplace for buying and selling apps and websites. If this sounds like a good way to make money for you, you should definitely check out my YouTube Channel to see in-depth videos on how to re-skin apps efficiently. Also, join my Facebook Group so you can talk with other beginner re-skinners and learn from the experts too! I honestly believe somebody working hard at re-skinning apps can pull in six figures per year. It\u2019ll take a little time to work up to this point, but its doable. Good luck making money! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to earn lots of money and get rich is to invest your money! If you\u2019re looking for a safe investment that generates good profits, consider investing your money in real estate. One of the benefits of investing your money in real estate is that there is no \u201cone way fits all\u201d! There are many ways to make a lot of money in real estate investing, and as a real estate investor, you can choose whichever investment strategies work best for you. So, here are best ways to make a lot of money and get rich from real estate investing: Single-Family Homes Single-family homes are the most common type of residential real estate investment properties. These investment properties consist of one unit which houses only one family, are built on a single lot, and are not attached to anyone else\u2019s residence. Single-family homes are highly recommended to property investors \u2013 especially beginners. Why so? Investing in this type of investment properties means the real estate investor rents out the income property to long-term tenants. Thus, property investors can rely on single-family homes to generate positive cash flow in the form of monthly rent for the long-term. Multi-Family Homes These are another type of residential real estate investment properties. As their name states, multi-family homes consist of more than one unit to house more than one family. They range between anything from duplexes to 32-units apartment complexes! Similar to single-family homes, property investors in multi-family homes rent out investment properties to long-term tenants. However, investing in these properties secures property investors an even higher positive cash flow and return on investment since multi-family homes contain more residential units, meaning more tenants paying monthly rent. Related: Best Long Term Investments: Single-Family and Multi-Family Homes Airbnb Rentals Airbnb is an online platform that allows a real estate investor to rent out a residential income property for the short-term (normally less than 6 months). Renting out through Airbnb has become one of the best and most popular real estate investment strategies to make a lot of money in real estate investing. Airbnb rental has proven to be a very profitable investment strategy and, depending on the location of the income property, can even yield a higher return on investment than traditional residential rentals. Related: Real Estate Investing: Traditional vs. Airbnb Investments Commercial Real Estate As previously mentioned, there are many investment strategies in the world of real estate investing. Investing in commercial real estate means the real estate investor rents out an investment property to businesses (not residents). Obviously, since business generally generate more than individuals, commercial real estate investment properties yields a higher income and return on investment. Wholesaling You can make a lot of money and get rich with real estate investing without property ownership through wholesaling. Basically, a wholesaler works as a middleman between buyers and sellers in a real estate transaction. All the real estate investor has to do is find a seller, assign an investment property to a contract, and sells the contract to an end-buyer and walks away with a portion of profits made. Real estate wholesaling is one of the best ways to passively make money in real estate. Real Estate Investment Trusts This is another way to passively make money without property ownership! With this investment strategy, a real estate investor buys shares of a REIT that invests in multiple investment projects. Forget about the hassle of becoming a landlord, dealing with tenants, and collecting rent! Investing in REITs not only provides a real estate investor with passive income, but also a diversified investment portfolio! As you can see, making a lot of money and getting rich with real estate is actually not that difficult! However, you should keep in mind that although there are numerous investment strategies to choose from, what works for one real estate investor doesn\u2019t necessarily work for another.

            "answer_text": "THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAKING MONEY ESPECIALLY ONLINE. (1) FOREX- The forex market has now opened has now opened up to just about anyone with an internet-connected device and a small deposit to use as margin. The key to running a long term forex trading business is consistent profitability since few people will tolerate losing money while still investing valuable time in the process. All you need is as follows: Internet connectionFind an online and trusted brokerOpen a forex accountFund your new forex accountDownload a forex trading platformTrading begins!NOTE: Before you make a live trade, you will probably want to take some time to learn how to enter and exit trades properly using your online trading platform with a demo account before you make a real transaction, once you feel confident enough in your ability to use the platform, you are then ready to enter your first trade. (2) BITCOIN: There is a lot to know about bitcoin trading, and you need to do more research on it but I will give you an idea about it. Before you start, Decode how you want to deal bitcoinLearn the factors that move bitcoin\u2019s pricechoose a bitcoin trading strategymake your first bitcoin tradeThere are two ways to deal bitcoin: buy the cryptocurrency itself in the hope of selling it on at a profit, or speculate on its value without ever owning the token. The latter is how CFDs work. A CFD enables you to trade a contract based on prices in the underlying market. It is a leveraged product, meaning you can put down a small initial deposit and still gain the exposure of a much larger position. This can magnify your profits, though it can have the same effect on your losses. (3) there is more and more demand for what ever services you offer to the global market for digital services. For example You could offer Ebooks or reports you have writtenMake a video testimonialUse software to provide SEO diagnostic resultsTake pictures with signsOffer social media servicesWrite quickly and get paidUse market software to get paidDesign flyersBecome a virtual assistantResearch: you can get paid to use google for a research projectCreate digital drawings(4) YouTube: Making money from YouTube used to be as simple as uploading great content, garnering millions of views, and earning a share of advertising revenue. Depending on what you are good at, you could put out great contents on YouTube gathering loads of views and start making enough money for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "To make lots of money, do not make money your goal. The statement above might seem paradoxical but there is logic behind this. Let's look at two people: call them Bill and Elon. Imagine that Bill is the world's richest man and a billionaire who founded a fictional company called Microsoft and that Elon is also a billionaire who founded companies with cool names such as PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, etc. They both have goals in their lives. Elon's is to make a multiplanetary human race and strike a path of solar energy in human industrial uses. Bill's is to build a system to make our everyday lives easier.  Now that we have our character backgrounds, let's move onto the paradoxical statement To make lots of money, do not make money your goal. Let us look at Elon because I know him better than Bill. If money was what Elon wanted, then he would have stopped after he sold PayPal for over 1 billion dollars, earning him over 200 million dollars. He was already a multimillionaire. He didn't need more money. But he didn't stop there because that wasn't his goal. His goal was to make a multiplanetary human race and sustainable environment and in doing so with he acquired billions of dollars from SpaceX and Tesla. There will be wealthy people who does not provide support to the statement above. However, that is the statement I believe in and I hope more people would believe in too. If you are going to be rich, at least do it for a noble cause. ",

            "answer_text": "Did you know you can actually make money online? yeah that\u2019s right, and all you need is a computer or phone with internet access. I\u2019m going to show you10 websites where you can actual start making some side cash or if you are really serious, some good Money! isn\u2019t that amazing! On some of these websites you can actually make as much as a 100 dollars a day or even more, and the best part is, you don\u2019t have to quit your 9 - 5 job, you can make this money, working in your free time. On the internet, there are two distinct ways of making money. The first way is active income. With active income, its like your normal9 -5 job. You only get paid for the work you do. If you do not work, you don\u2019t make money, as simple as that. The second way is through passive income. This is my favorite method because, with active income, all you do is put in the work once, and the money in theory should keep rolling in, without you having to do any more work other then maybe promoting what you have made, or in some cases what other people have made. Upworksis a website for freelancers. With upworks you are making active income. businesses and individuals post services on upworks that they would like to outsource such as article writing, video editing, app development, coding, there tons of jobs and services being outsourced on upwork. The beauty of all this is its low barrier of entry, you just have to be good at something. If there is something that you are good at may be graphic design or coding or just about any skill, head over to upworks and start making some Money. Here's a tip if you are considering working on upworks, have a robust profile that looks good. This will drastically increase your likelihood of ever receiving job offers, from potential clients. Displaying your best work or highlighting specific experience can and will help you stand out. 2. YouTube.Not a lot of people know this but, you can actually make money with YouTube. If you are considering getting into YouTube to make money, make sure you understand one thing clearly. Thanks to the new rules, if you are planning on starting a brand new channel from scratch, you first have to reach the YouTube minimum threshold to get monetized. Which is you will need 4000 watch hours, and1000 subscribers in the last 12 months. Once you have reached that, you can get monetized, how much can you make on YouTube? Honestly as much as you want! As long as you keep uploading good content that people are willing to watch your golden, and the longer the video the more money you can expect to make. you can make anywhere from 1$ to thousands even hundreds of thousands of dollars. The more views you are getting, the more money you can expect to make, and also you get more subscribers! With YouTube, what you are earning is passive income, make a few videos and they should keep making you money consistently. You can also make money with YouTube through paid sponsorships, but with paid sponsorships you will need a large audience, usually a minimum of 10k subs to do that. You can also make money through affiliates, but we will get to that later. 3. Amazon.Although Jeff Bazos, did start off the company selling books, amazon now sells almost anything you can think of. It\u2019s not just a site for buying your favorite toys though, you can actually make money with amazon. And here\u2019s three ways you how. The first way is Amazon Mturk \u2013 Mtruk is kind of like upworks, it\u2019s a place where businesses outsource work that is too difficult for a computer program to do. Such as audio editing and transcribing, translating audio and video from different languages, testing webpages, writing reviews, and a whole lot of other services. You can make as much as $20, $30 an hour, by working on a few different tasks. This is a legit may of making money, and they do pay. This is active income though. The second way is Amazon kindle publishing. Turn your ideas into an eBook and make money today. Every time you buy an ebook from amazon, amazon and the publisher make money, and you can too. The thing with kindle publishing is\u2026 you first need a book to sell. You can either write this book yourself or you can hire someone to write it for you. You don't have to be an established author, or find a publishing company to do this. You can actually do this from the comfort of your home and start earning some passive income. Sounds awesome right? and the best part is, it\u2019s absolutely free, so sign up and start making some money. Amazon takes care of the money handling shenanigans\u2026and you can sit back relax on your couch, while making some good old\u2026 passive income. If you are really interested in kindle publishing, I highly recommend you do more research on this topic. You can find free videos and tutorials right hereon YouTube that will teach you the basics. If you want expert advice, you might have to first pay for a course. I will link a really good one in the description, if you are interested. Some people make over $100,000 publishing Kindle e-books on Amazon. It\u2019s definitely a market to look into. The third way is Amazon associates program. This is a very popular and easy way of earning passive income. All you do is sign up to the amazon associates program which is free, than you can pick from thousands of stuff amazon sells on their website and start promoting. Amazon will give you a special link, and every time someone buys through your link, amazon will give you a commission anywhere from 5\u2013 10% of the sale. Amazon will pay you 60 days after a purchase and you can chose to be paid either through amazon gift cards, wire transfer to a bank account \u2013 although this is currently only available in the US but if you live outside America you can be paid via cheques, or you can have the money transferred to your amazon account and start buying stuff with it. 4. click bankClick bank is a marketplace for product creators and affiliates to make money online buy selling their courses or services to the world. Click bank only sells digital products, but the beauty about click bank is that the, commission payout is so much higher than that of Amazon. Some affiliates pay you as much as 75%, for selling their services, while others pays as low as 5%, so keep that in mind. But with that said, you can make some really good money on click bank, hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Simply head over to click bank, pick something to sale and start making money. 5. flippa,comflippa is the number one marketplace for buying and selling online businesses. It attracts a huge audience, and it offers great tools to increase visibility, it\u2019s an auction site really much like eBay, for those selling and buying digital assets, such as websites, apps, domains, shopify stores and amazon FBA accounts. If you are good at making apps or even websites\u2026you can actually sell it online and make some money. Or better yet, if you have some money lying around and you are interested in buying either websites, apps, or ecommerce stores\u2026 that are already making money , you can do so with flippa. What happens is, you place a bid, much like e Bay and if your bid is the highest, then congratulations because you just bought yourself an online business. You can also make money by selling online businesses. So that\u2019s flippa for you. 6. Shutter stock.Basically shutter stock is a platform where you can buy or sell digital media. Such as pictures, music and video clips. Mainly created by freelancers and third parties ,so if you might be particularly good at photography taking amazing pictures and videos. Or really good at making sick beats, you can monetize your talent on shutter stock. The way you make money with shutter stock is every time some purchases one of your pictures, you get paid a commission, usually a couple cents to a few dollars, if you are lucky. The trick to making a lot of money with shutter stock is to consistently keep uploading high quality images. 7. Rover.Do you like pets? Dog in particular? If so, then you should probably check out rover. Rover is a dog sitting service, but this is currently only available in the US and Canada. So if you live in any of those two countries then you can register as a dog sitter, and get paid for babysitting dogs. You can make anywhere between 80 - $100 a night, just by watching someone\u2019s dog! You can literally make hundreds of dollar sa week by just babysitting someone\u2019s pet. Now how about that for a deal?! 8. The take lessonTake lessons is a website where you can teach any skill. Everyone has a skill, that they can teach, whether that might be, teaching someone a language, how to cook, how to play a musical instrument, how to solve complex math equations\u2026 any so much more. Anything that you think someone else might not know, you can teach people on take lessons, and start making money. 9. Fiverr.You have probably heard of fivver mentioned a lot of times, because it\u2019s a simple and easy site to start making money. But if you haven\u2019t, basically it\u2019s a freelance website where you can literally outsource anything and I mean anything\u2026 as long asits legal, for as little as $5 There are so many different ways to make money on fiverr, just to name a few. You can do animations, Logo Design, Packaging Design, Web &amp; Mobile Design, Social Media Design, Photoshop Editing, Architecture &amp; Floor Planning, 3D Models &amp; Product Design, T-Shirts &amp; Merchandising, SEO and so much more. If there is anything that can be outsourced, you can most likely find it on fiver. Head over and check out fiverr guys, it a legit of making money. 10. Drop shipping.With drop shipping, what you are basically doing is selling someone else stuff for a small or large profit without having to deal with the shipping. So basically you are acting like a broker or a middle man. You can do this by opening up a shopify store and then linking it up with oberlo. Oberlo is basically an app that integrates with shopify, and it is what a lot of people use to source for stuff that they would like to sell on their stores. The basic principle of drop shipping is, you create a store or any channel where people can buy stuff from you. Then once they buy something from you, you pay the manufacturer, usually for a lot less then what you got it for, and then have the manufacturer ship it to the customer. All without you ever seeing or touching the product. The best part of drop shipping is that you set your own price of the product you want to sell, then take the profits and pay the manufacturer the rest. So yeah that\u2019s drop shipping in a nutshell. If you are interested in drop shipping, there are a ton of tutorial here on YouTube, that will show you the step by step guide of creating your store, finding products, advertising, finding influencers, and finally shipping and getting paid. It\u2019s a bit complicated to start, especially in the beginning, but you can make a ton of money\u2026 with drop shipping. ",

            "answer_text": "The definition of 'lots' is different for different people.   If you really want to be Bill-Gates-Rich, the only sure way is to inherit from someone who is already that rich.  Bill Gates got rich by being very, very good but also by being in the right place at the right time.  When he started Microsoft, it was not at all obvious that personal computers would become so big.  So you have to be one of a handful of the best people in the world, in a business that's not too crowded with competitors, and that grows phenomenally.  Good luck. Of course, the best in the world can get rich in many fields.  I think Gary Kasparov got rich as a chess player.  But in most countries, even the national chess champion needs a day job.  So - duh! -  in any field almost everyone fails to be 'best.'   Ask how well someone average or a bit above average does in a field. If a medical doctor's income (100,000+ $US/year) satisfies your definition of 'lots of money,' then you need to become good at something that most other people either can't do or don't really try to do.  In the US, the first challenge is to get into medical school.  Odds are not good, even if you are a very good undergraduate student.  It's much easier to get into law school.  But the distribution of incomes is pretty broad for lawyers.  The best make a lot of money but there are also many lawyers who struggle. In most fields 'Research PhD' is a pretty small pool.  Average researchers in physics, chemistry, medicine, and many other fields do well.  But funding goes up and down and there are some years where new PhDs don't find jobs.   So, besides studying the right subject matter, you also need to become an expert on where the jobs are and what other kinds of job you might do if Plan A doesn't work out.

            "answer_text": "TEACH. You\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cThere\u2019s no way that I\u2019m gonna do that. Have you seen how little teachers earn? No way!\u201d Let me, very briefly, introduce you to someone named Michelle Phan\u2026  You\u2019re probably thinking that she\u2019s just another entrepreneur who parlayed her wealth in one area to wealth in another, and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, then you\u2019re mistaken. Michelle Phan was actually a Fine Arts student, that happened to casually be interested in makeup application. She interacted with her readers on Xanga (remember that blogging platform?) and answered their questions about makeup. Eventually, she found it better to take those FAQs and turn them into live video content on Youtube. Mind you, she was not a professional makeup artist; just someone who had a bit of knowledge to share. The reason why I like Michelle\u2019s story is specifically because she demonstrates that something serendipitous (like being at the right place, at the right time) can turn into an intentional business. When she started creating demonstrative content on Youtube, there was no Adsense partner programme, and content creators were not receiving monetary compensation for their contributions\u2014however, when she realized that her content was bringing in money, she got serious and earned herself her first $1 million in annual revenue, way back in 2013 (or so). The rest of her story has been documented all over the web for your further reading\u2026 We are miles away from the years of being \u201cthe only one\u201d doing something on Youtube, or \u201cthe only one\u201d creating a certain type of content on any platform \u2014nowadays, everyone is vying for everyone\u2019s limited attention, making the environment a little hostile to new content. However, It\u2019s in this exact \u201chostile\u201d environment where valuable content flourishes! No matter which platform is the most popular or what the pop-culture trends are, people will still be curious about new information/techniques or facts. If you are disciplined enough to create your own course, dedicated enough to put some money (for marketing) behind it, and committed enough to not quit your day job (haha); you could make some serious bank! You don\u2019t have to even be a PRO, because to be honest, if people wanted to learn from professionals, they wouldn\u2019t be on Google. I\u2019m an avid student, and after starting various businesses from a young age, I think it\u2019s important to learn valuable lessons and then pass those lessons on to others, so that they can innovate even faster. With that being said, I don\u2019t think that teaching will ever be out of style. If you are really serious about making money, then I\u2019ll say it again: TEACH! ",

            "answer_text": "Earning lots of money often means getting a high paying job but if you're looking to make lots of money then you need to discover a problem that many people have and create a solution for it. Another way to make lots of money is to identify current solutions that are either inefficient or poorly implemented and then find a way to greatly improve it. Another thing to consider is that you will need to become a risk taker, someone who is willing to do things that others might believe isn't logical. Consider some of the greatest inventions that we take for granted right now. The Internet, airplanes, cars, social media websites and services that have upended entire industries like Uber upending the taxi industry or online travel sites that ended the local travel agency. Also look at how services like TurboTax or even tax act are slowly replacing the local tax preparation company. These are just a few examples of inventions or service solutions that have changed the way we operate as a society. Another way to make lots of money is the old-school way that still works which is learning how to invest in stocks & bonds and learning how to buy and sell real estate. The flipside The fastest way to go broke is to try a get rich quick scheme that bleeds you of all your money. Just remember that if it's too good to be true most often it is. Hopefully this helps and good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Master the meeting The average pay bump from a promotion is about 7%, though it can be even more once you\u2019re a manager, according to Mercer. But how do you get one? \u201cThe meeting room is where we exert leadership and develop credibility,\u201d says corporate trainer Dana Brownlee of Professionalism Matters. Don\u2019t dominate\u2014nudge the group toward concrete goals. If someone can\u2019t let go of a point, try saying, \u201cGood idea! I\u2019m writing it down.\u201d You\u2019ve now freed a room of grateful co-workers to move on. 2. Lend a hand at work Research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has shown that successful people do more favors at work, but don\u2019t be afraid to ask for tiny favors too. We may actually feel more warmly toward people after lending them a hand\u2014our brains figure we must have done so because we like that person. It\u2019s been called the Benjamin Franklin effect: The Founding Father recalled winning over a legislative rival after borrowing a book from him. \u201cOur attitudes often follow our behavior instead of vice versa,\u201d says David McRaney, who writes about such psychological quirks in his book You Are Now Less Dumb. 3. Learn a language It\u2019s easier than ever to dip a toe into languages with free tools like Duolingo, a site and app that make learning like a game. If you then want to ramp things up, real-world classes run about $300 for 20 hours of instruction. Invest your time and money wisely: The payoff is in less commonly studied languages. A Wharton/LECG Europe study found that speaking German translated into a higher wage premium than for second languages overall. Ambitious? There\u2019s a big market for Mandarin. 4. Get techy Computer-science grads earn $700,000 over the average B.A. holder in a career, but those with English and psych degrees aren\u2019t out of luck: There are ways to use technology smarter\u2014and get recognized for it\u2014at all levels. For example, if there\u2019s any need to quantify your business\u2019s activity, being the office Excel guru makes you valuable. Two skills to focus on: building charts (great for presentations) and pivot tables (to summarize lots of data). The ExcelIsFun YouTube channel is loaded with lessons. Want to compete with true techies? Codecademy - learn to code, interactively, for free can get you started for free learning code for building websites. Expertise in Ruby on Rails\u2014certification testing is $150\u2014snags an average salary of $110,000, says data crunched by Quartz. If all this sounds like too much work, at least Google better. Seriously. Say, for example, you need stats about a product\u2019s market share: Use \u201cOR\u201d (in caps) to Google for different words that might capture the same thing (like \u201cpercent\u201d and \u201cproportion\u201d). And check the image search results: The data you need may be in a chart someone has posted. Go to Google\u2019s help center for more power tips. 5. Write better A clear, unfussy writing style will get your ideas heard at work. (HR pros ranked writing second, behind only computer aptitude, among skills applicants most often lacked.) Harvard professor Steven Pinker, author of the new book The Sense of Style, gave us these tips for better writing: Avoid fancy words you don\u2019t need or understand. \u201cFulsome\u201d (as in \u201cfulsome praise\u201d) does not mean full; it means insincere. If you use hoity-toity words to sound posh, you will look pompous and may say the opposite of what you mean. Cut unnecessary words. John Kerry once said, \u201cThe President is desirous of trying to see how we can make our efforts in order to find a way to facilitate.\u201d What he meant was, \u201cThe President wants to help.\u201d Much better. Revise. And better still, show it to someone. What\u2019s clear to you may not be clear to someone else. 6. Learn social savvy If you run a business or work in marketing, social media like Twitter seem like a great way to get your message out. But remember that users have zero interest in following companies that clutter their feed with ads. Use social to establish your expertise or spark ideas; then when people are in the market for what you sell, they\u2019ll remember you. Hannah Morgan, co-author of Social Networking for Business Success, explains that a good tweet is self-contained and has a discrete piece of information worth sharing. What works well is language like, \u201cBaking cookies? Add eggs one at a time so you can mix in evenly. For more tips check out our Baking 101 guide.\u201d Then add a link. A less effective tweet is something like, \u201cWe\u2019re having a sale on tins of our delicious chocolate chip cookies. $19.99 all day Friday\u201d because it reads like an advertisement and is therefore is unlikely to be shared. 7. Take back your workday If you get paid a flat salary, turning a 10-hour day into nine more-productive hours is like giving yourself an 11% hourly raise. Try three key moves from former Fidelity president Bob Pozen, author of Extreme Productivity: First, handle each email just once. Reply, file, or trash\u2014don\u2019t come back to it later. Second, hide that extra chair; you\u2019ll discourage chatty co-workers from lingering. Finally, you might want to consider timing your breaks, since research shows your brain loses focus on a task after about 90 minutes. 8. Sell yourself \u201cTen years ago job seekers would write a full-page cover letter,\u201d says executive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writer Wendy Enelow. A better approach now is an email designed to cut through the electronic clutter. Use the subject line to note your key selling points. Instead of \u201cDirector of sales position,\u201d write \u201cDirector of Sales\u201410 Years of Exceeding Sales Quotas\u2014MBA.\u201d In the body of the email, spotlight a major accomplishment. Follow up with three big career wins in bullet points. 9. Learn to DIY Some jobs always require a professional but, with a little prep, tasks like painting a room or replacing your car\u2019s air filters can be a piece of cake\u2014and save you a solid amount of money. A painting pro, for example, could easily charge $1,600 for a big job, vs. up to $400 in materials on your own. Rich O\u2019Neil of Masterwork Painting & Restoration in Woburn, Mass., explains that to get professional results you must dust surfaces and tape up edges and moldings you don\u2019t want painted. Painting should go in two types of strokes: First apply a thin layer for coverage. Then paint over it to even and smooth. You can replace your car\u2019s air filters yourself every 12,000 miles on newer cars. You\u2019ll save about $50 in labor costs, says Mike Forsythe of Haynes, an auto-repair guidebook publisher, and pay 25% less for the filter by getting it at a parts store. To change an engine filter, check the housing in the engine compartment; in most cars there\u2019s a cover you can unlatch with your fingers. You\u2019ll typically find the cabin filter inside the car, behind the glove box. 10. Get organized Everyone hates paying a late fee just because of a forgotten reminder to pay a bill on time. And few tasks are as irritating as foraging for receipts from months and months ago. The key to never losing track of important papers is to keep just one bin and make sure to empty your pockets and purse into it every night. Then set a regular date on your calendar to empty the bin and organize the receipts. \u201cIf you wait too long, you may not even remember your purchase,\u201d says professional organizer Andrew Mellen. If you find it hard to even check your calendar on a routine basis, pair a daily check with your morning coffee\u2014or any other routine you already have. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Secret of money making lies in delivering value.  The sole driver for making money (other than inheritance) is making lives of people simpler and easier. The more easier you make the lives of people, the more time you save of people, the more you make lives of people comfortable, the more you are going to earn. Let\u2019s see some top examples- Amazon Inc. - It started from books initially now delivers A to Z items. What it did for people? It simply made millions of items available at one place and provide convenience of sitting at home and requesting products with few clicks. Facebook Inc. - Before facebook and other social networking sites, a news or simply an idea took a lot of time to travel from one place to another and till then people became aware of the problem, it is already widespread. What if corona virus outbreak occurred in pre-internet era? Mind-boggling question. If you think of an idea, you can directly communicate it to your friend. It is like telepathy. It made life easier. Microsoft Inc. - Microsoft created Microsoft Office which now dominates almost all offices of the country with millions of active users daily. Microsoft office helped us with presentations, spreadsheets, word document management, etc. thereby delivering easier ways to manage mega data. In short, it made our life easier. You take any company who earns money. The important question is, how did it make lives simpler? In fact, people who are earning money around you are earning because of the same reason- Teacher- Teacher is making life simpler and thereby adding value to the lives of student by bringing ease to the subject and increase comfort levels.Professionals- Years invested by professionals like CA, CS, Lawyers, etc invested their years of life in learning the skill to make lives of people easier. Time efficiency is the key factor here. The faster you deliver (without compromising quality), the more you\u2019re paid.Chef- Nobody is going to hotels currently, so chill. Chef creates the recipes, menus, and does other managerial tasks. In short, it indirectly helps people to have a better experience at hotels. Making money is directly proportional to quality of value delivered. In itself, money means something in return for delivering value. Isn\u2019t this a simple concept? Are we striving to make money or delivering value? Thank-you for reading. ",

(It could be millions for some while for some a million dollars is not even enough money for an year)Time. Decide the time frame in which you want to make that money (use common sense as well its obviously not possible to make $200 billion in one sec, atleast not for me)Follow the money, google ways and those streams, places, profession, ways which have that kind of money you want to make and then work hard smartly in that direction. Try to find the edge over other people.Make a realistic and practical plan which works for you.Be disciplined, consistent and focused.Be patient empires aren\u2019t built overnight.For eg. Say my goal is to make $3 billion, I find streams where there are billions to be made, since m a finance guy stock markets work for me.I\u2019ll try to find an edge over others what more could I know that other people won\u2019t know. Cuz at the end making money is a game, what could you possible give to take money out of other people pocket.Say I decide I want to make $3 billion in 4 yrs (you also have to believe its possible becuz I dont think you\u2019ll make it if you don\u2019t believe yourself).Now I\u2019ll plan accordingly what do I need to learn! How do I get started! Where the big money is.Try finding and following people who have already made it it helps I know whom I wanna be like or what qualities of them I want.Search about them how they did it what were there past experiences, where did they started, what books did they read try to step in their shoe.Always ask yourself what wld they do if they were in your position.Final and most important step work hard smartly, be disciplined and consistent and keep grinding and learning with patience. (You need all of it there\u2019s not one quality which takes u ahead in life its a combination of qualities)",

Connect with people while you are there. Participate in company events. Learn how to communicate issues you may have with work or with other workers. (7) Keep money safe in a trusted local financial institution. Seek advice from qualified financial advisers with your interests in mind. (Jon Oliver has a good video on this topic that I liked. You will have to search for that on YouTube.) (8) Realize that your financial status is what you earn minus your expenses \u2014 your \u201cnet worth\u201d. It varies by your location, your currency and your economic level. You can learn to live with less if you reduce expenses.

            "answer_text": "Funny enough, there are lots of ways to earn lots of money. I wrote 112 Profitable Side Hustle Ideas You Can Start Doing Today with the intent of giving people options for earning more money. I\u2019ll share a few of those in this answer and provide more of a framework for how you can earn lots of money.  First, it\u2019s important to understand why exactly you want to earn \u201clots of money.\u201d Think about it for a second. Why do you want to earn lots of money? What are you wishing to buy with this money? What are you hoping this money will bring you? Second, you\u2019ll want to clarify how much money you want to earn, as this influences the activities you\u2019ll pursue. \u201cLots of money\u201d is way too vague - make the number concrete. Is it\u2026 $100,000? $500,000? $1,000,000? $100,000,000? Get clear on just how much money you want to make. Third, consider the time frame you have for earning lots of money. Do you want to make a lot of money in\u2026 6 months? 1 year? 5 years? Making money takes time. If you\u2019re like Walter White in Breaking Bad, and want to simply make as much as possible, you could become a world-class drug dealer (Not advised), but of course that has its consequences. So think about how much time you\u2019ll give yourself to make the amount of money you want to make. Lastly, think about the time you\u2019re willing to commit to making money. How much time and effort are you really willing to put into making money? Seriously, lots of people say they want to make lots of money, but few are willing to put in the time and effort. Be honest with yourself, but think about how much time and effort you\u2019re willing to put in to making money. So, how the heck do you get started?  As I mentioned previously, there are lots of ways to make lots of money, so choose the method you think you can execute. What I mean is, pick a method for earning money that you have the skills, passion, and desire to turn into a reality. When I was just getting started in my career I was a personal trainer. However, I knew I wouldn\u2019t make the amount of money I wanted to make simply by training clients at the gym. So I created Just Go Fitness to train clients in their homes, at parks, and eventually online. I made thousands of dollars through this, a dramatic increase to the amount of money I was making at the gym. You have to find what will work best for you. I\u2019m not sure how much money you want to make, but here are some options: Freelancing through UpWorkCreate your own consulting companyStart a web design companyCreate a content writing companySell products on AmazonCreate a blog and monetize through online courses, affiliate marketing, and advertisingStart a podcast and monetize through advertisingCreate an event coordinating companyStart a personal chef serviceSell real estateTrade stocksDevelop apps for peopleCreate your own appSell products on EtsyCreate a digital marketing agencyStart a membership siteCreate a new subscription boxStart a Shopify store and dropship productsWrite a book and sell itCreate a YouTube show and sponsor it through PatreonThere are so many ways to make money, especially with the internet and all the resources it provides. Find that thing YOU want to do and work every day to grow it. Good luck! Justin 112 Side Hustle Ideas ",

A long time ago in a country not so faraway lived many peeps. All were greedy-grunchy gold diggers. They lived to dig. They lived to find gold. All they had? A pickaxe and an incredible greediness. They wanted to find gold. Not a simple golden nugget. Tai Lopez bank account of gold. With such aspirations, how could they give up? They couldn\u2019t. All their life resolved around mining. After waking up, they would sharpen their pickaxe. Then, go to the nearest mine. And mine. And dig. And hope. Most days, they came back with nothing except back pain. \u201cMaybe the spot doesn\u2019t have any gold\u201d thought out loud one of the smartest miners. He was 60 years old but never touched a single golden nugget. In over a century, he was the first one with the idea of going somewhere else. With dozens of young and robust men, he moved to the next valley. They set up their camp. Slept. And started again their endless mining ritual. They did so for several months. 8 of the 12 vigorous miners came back more depressed than ever to the original camp. 4 were still in the valley. 2 weeks after, they found a gargantuan cave full of gold. More than a treasure, it was astonishing. Butt. The 8 peeps who leaved earlier? They got nothing. Peanuts. When you want to make money, the same applies to you guys! Give up too early and you\u2019ll come back with peanuts! That\u2019s exactly why I drop golden nuggets on my daily mailing list. Get them! Don\u2019t miss the fun - and the gold. ",

Yet, we manage to thrive, win national and state awards, and dominate the market because we are professional, genuinely kind, supporting community, and taking a great care of our employees. We also stand by our work and our people. Whenever anything goes wrong - and in any business things inevitably do - we accept responsibility and make it right. You can\u2019t fool the crowd. To earn lots of money you must find lots of people willing to give you that money. And they won\u2019t give you the money unless you give them something even greater in return. Give them peace of mind knowing they deal with reputable and responsible company. Give them comfort of knowing you will be kind and pleasant to deal with. Give them joy of spending more time with their families, better health, more beautiful environment to live in.  Superb Maids was started with a $1K investment. And generated its first million within the second year of business. A national franchise is next. We never set out to generate lots and lots of money. But we were determined to provide great value to our clients, from day 1. ",

Do you understand optionality, the use of a small some of money to control large outcomes?  This understanding  is where you invest 10K to make 100K, not investing 100K to make 3K. If you do not understand this and how to calculate risks - stop. 3. Most fortunes are made in business that are self owned.  Do you have the ideas and energy to make some new and utterly compelling?  There is nothing wrong or different to the money made, between a fantastic new medical device or a chain of restaurants - but you must understand \"utterly compelling\"?   If not stop. 4.  Can you work within a team and still lead a team, as nothing you care going to do in life to make a ton of money is going to be done solo.  If you are a soloist - stop. 5.

            "answer_text": "Important Realization : Many of the Wealthy folks also started from their way down. They also went to the same years of growing up like normal people, they went through the same educational system\u2026. You get the drift I believe it is their Attitude towards money that helped them catapult them to the great heights where they stand right now. The biggest thing holding back most people from striking it big are their thoughts, beliefs and philosophies about money So I will be listing some of the ways in which the successful people handled money, how they perceive it and utilize it. 1. The wealthy focus on earning. The masses focus on how to protect and hoard their money. The wealthy also know saving is important. But they know earning money is even more important. Most people are more concerned with the modest gains they accumulate from their savings and investments than they are with using their billion-dollar minds to create a fortune. Instead of focusing on clipping coupons and living frugally, the wealthy reject the nickel-and-dime thinking of the masses and focus their mental energy where it belongs: on the big money. You gotta choose: Save Or Earn?  2. The wealthy use leverage. Leverage basically translates into using lesser efforts to get bigger payouts In the minds of millionaires, leverage is everything. The wealthy strategically focus their efforts on the most profitable areas of their businesses while leveraging their contacts, credibility, and resources to maximize the results of every action they take. The middle class sees hard work as a badge of honor. The wealthy sees success as a more important badge of honor. Think about what you were taught about hard work growing up. If you're not exactly raking in the money, make a decision to let go of any limiting beliefs you have about hard work, and start thinking about how you can use leverage to become more successful. Use leverage to strategically achieve more with less !!  3. The wealthy think about money in non-linear terms. The masses trade time for money. This creates the belief that making money is a linear process directly connected to time. The average person believes the only way to earn more money - with the exception of raises and bonuses - is to work more hours. Millionaires know big money requires thinking about it in non-linear terms. They are masters at generating money through ideas that solve problems. They realize there is no limit to ideas; therefore, there is no limit to how much money they can earn. Fortunes can be created almost overnight with the right idea at the right time, but only if the creator understands this non-linear phenomenon. Translate that idea into money !  If you follow these simple rules, I believe success wont be elusive anymore, It would all depend on the quantum of your efforts how smartly you deploy leverage PS: I have already started following this path\u2026You would have to buck up if you want to catch up!!

            "answer_text": " Getting Started as a Freelancer : To get started, check out jobs on freelancer websites like People per Hour and Up work. By browsing these sites you will get a good understanding of what freelance jobs are available. And although the majority of the jobs on these sites are quite low paid, they are a great place to start. Once you have decided what services you will offer as a freelancer (keep reading to find out more on freelancing options), and have a couple of jobs under your belt, you should next create your own website. This will help you promote your services and showcase your work and testimonials from previous clients. You should also email websites in your niche to advertise your services and get your name out there as a professional in your field. As you become well known within your chosen industry, you will quite quickly find you are inundated with job offers. So now we know a bit about freelancing let\u2019s have a look at some of the services you could offer as a freelancer\u2026 1. Write for Blogs With so many blogs needing content, website owners are crying out for writers to produce interesting blog posts on a regular basis. Writing blog posts varies greatly in pay, from $5 to $250 for 1000 words. If you are serious about becoming a freelance writer, pick a niche and become an expert on this subject. Some subjects are much better paid than others, so although you may love the idea of writing about travel (badly paid) a better bet would be a niche like finance (much higher rates of pay). Check out the Pro Blogger job board for high paid freelance writing jobs \u2013 other places to look might be Text broker or you can look at the \u201cgigs\u201d section on Craigslist. 2. Copy writing Writing copy for websites is another great freelancing option for those who have a way with words. Copy writing can involve writing the text for websites, press releases, promotional offline materials including leaflets and brochures, and any other professional text for businesses. While writing blog posts is well paid it won\u2019t make you as much money as writing copy for sales pages. However, clients can be more fussy, as they want the highest quality writing for the forefront of their website or advertising campaigns. Many freelance writers offer both copy writing and blog writing amongst their services. This can be a good way to juggle regular but lower paid clients (blogging) with the higher paid but ad-hoc project based copy work. 3. Virtual Assistant (VA) I have 3 V-As. I couldn\u2019t function without them. It doesn\u2019t matter how big or how small a business is, they all need help running their day-to-day administrative tasks. Virtual assistants perform a variety of tasks that a traditional assistant or secretary would normally do, including making travel arrangements, paying bills, or managing expense reimbursements. I use them to upload content, optimize images, brief writers etc. Virtual assistants typically work from home or wherever there\u2019s an available Wi-Fi connection. They regularly interact with clients by phone, email, or Skype on behalf of their boss. How much can a virtual assistant actually make? It usually depends on their level of expertise and overall experience. 4. Write Industry Papers If you have a background in a specific field, you may find there is a demand for writing industry papers in your area of expertise. For example, there are often adverts for doctors, lawyers, nutritionists, and business experts from particular niches, to write white papers on different subject areas. These are well paid jobs that you will need to stake your reputation on, but that can often be worked on from the comfort of your own home. 5. Editing If you are a fast reader and have a good grasp of grammar and language then editing may be a good freelance role for you. Editing is a great way to quickly make money online, and there are always editing jobs available on freelance job sites. And the best part? Editor\u2019s usually get paid per word, so the faster you can check through work the more money you will make per hour. 6. Website Design If you have an eye for design and some experience of creating websites, then you could offer your services as a freelance web designer. You will need to create your own stylish website and have a few other projects that you can show potential clients to demonstrate your skills. You will also need to initially spend time emailing businesses to promote your services and find work. Web design consists of mainly project-based jobs. However, you can offer ongoing maintenance for a monthly fee, which can be a good way to guarantee regular pay. Web design fees also differ greatly. So you will need to make the decision whether to target small businesses or compete for large clients with bigger budgets. Tools & Resources: I\u2019ve written a pretty comprehensive guide on the best web design software that covers both free and premium software packages. If you\u2019re serious about becoming a web designer, then I recommend purchasing the full Adobe Creative Cloud Suite. At $49.99 per month, this is probably a bargain considering what you can achieve with this set of tools. 7. Landing Page Design A spin-off for web designers is to offer a landing page creation service. Well-optimized landing pages can be the difference between a successful and a failing business. And, as creating the perfect landing page isn\u2019t easy, this is a service many businesses are prepared to pay for. I know people who are earning 6 figures per year and all they do is create landing pages for businesses. There\u2019s serious money to be made. With online software such as Click Funnels (review), Optin monster (review) or Sumo-me, landing page creation is extremely easy to do, which makes this method of making money online a real possibility. Tools & Resources Click Funnels is offering new customers a 14 Day Free Trial to use their extremely easy to use landing page/sales funnel design platform. Sign up for a 7 day free trial with Optin monster to get a taste of how easy it is to create high converting landing pages that you can potentially sell to your new clients. 8. Graphic Design There are many freelance options for graphic designers who are looking to make money online. Designing layouts and graphics for promotional material, corporate reports, magazines or book covers, are all tasks that businesses are looking for online freelancers to complete. Due to its flexible nature, graphic design possibilities can range from one-off projects to ongoing work with regular clients. Tools & Resources: Envato Elements has thousands of graphic elements and templates that you can use for graphic design client work, and can save you so much time and effort. Rather than creating your own graphics from scratch, you can use pre-designed elements and customize them to make them unique to you. 9. Create Logos Logos are a crucial part of any business, and a talented graphic designer that can produce eye-catching logos will be in great demand. Although there are many graphic design jobs advertised on freelance websites, pitching your services to businesses will enable you to command a better price for your work. Tools & Resources: Did you know that there\u2019s logo generating services that you can use for free? I\u2019ve written about them all over on my Best Free Logo Generators guide. 10. Produce Info graphics Info graphics are currently an extremely popular type of media. An info graphic showing information or data in an interesting and fun way can help engage an audience and generate numerous likes and shares. As info graphics take more time to create than just simply uploading an image, busy website owners are prepared to pay for custom info graphics. And don\u2019t worry, an info graphic can be created using simple design software such a Canvas. So extensive graphic design skills are not necessary, just a creative eye. 11. Computer Programming If you have previous experience as a computer programmer or have skills in this field, then there is plenty of work you can pick up as a freelancer. If lack of confidence is holding you back, then Free Code Camp is an excellent way to get your foot in the coding door. This organization provides free courses where you will build real-life apps and programs, giving you experience and plenty to add to your CV. Tools & Resources: For the best coding tutorials and online courses check out Tree house. You can sign up for a free 7-day trial to see if it\u2019s for you. I\u2019ve completed many tutorials on Tree house over the years, and I can 100% recommend their courses. 12. App Development With apps being constantly developed, competent app developers are in high demand. Again, if you have the experience or skills to create successful apps then this could be something you could end up working on as a full-time freelancer. Check out adverts for developers on Toptal, a higher paying jobs site for experienced freelancers wanting to make money online. 13. Online PA If you have experience as a personal assistant, secretary, admin assistant, or something in a similar field, then becoming an online PA may be a great role for you. Many professionals want someone to help organize their business and personal affairs. Jobs could include sending emails, managing financial affairs, booking flights and arranging day-to-day activities. If you are interested in this line of work there are many PA agencies that are crying out for reliable assistants. 14. Social Marketing Manager Another strategy to make money online is to become a social marketing manager. Being present on social media is key for any business that wants to attract new customers, promote their products and grow their following. However, constantly posting, liking and commenting on the numerous social media channels is extremely time-consuming. More and more businesses are recruiting social media managers to run and organize all their social media. And to save money, social media employees are often employed as online freelancers. A social marketing manager could be asked to complete any tasks that are social media related. This could include scheduling all social media posts, running competitions, creating ad campaigns and much more, which can easily be done with social media management tools such as Sendible, Hootsuite or even these Instagram schedulers. Social media isn\u2019t rocket science, so if you have an interest in this area of work, start small and work your way up. Once you have the experience of running social media projects, you can start to advertise yourself as an expert in the \u2018social media\u2019 field. Small business owners don\u2019t have the time nor the expertise to grow their own social media following, so this is an area where you can capitalize. 15. Online Marketing Consultant If you have marketing experience then why not set yourself up as a freelance marketing consultant. Looking at businesses marketing strategies, advising on changes and improvements, and getting projects off the ground are all jobs that will be well paid for. 16. Online SEO Offering specific online SEO services is also another online freelancer role that businesses are crying out for. If you know how to improve a website\u2019s SEO by doing keyword research, creating content that can rank in search engines, adding metadata/schema to posts and pages, and building back links to a domain, to name a few tasks, then this could be a great line of work for you. 17. Fiverr Using Fiverr is a great way to pick up work. Once you have signed up you can advertise your services. Fiver allows you to create your own gigs, whether you are offering web design, digital marketing, writing, or something else. You can choose how much you want to charge (it can be more than a fiver) and people will then contact you if they are interested in working with you. Fiverr will not only help you get experience if you are just starting off as a freelancer, but it will also help you earn some extra cash. 18. Create Your Own Agency Once you have made a name for yourself as a successful freelancer in your field, quite quickly you will find that you are inundated with too much work to manage. So why not consider taking on other virtual employees and turn your one person show into an agency. Create And Monetize A Blog Creating your own blog can be a very effective way of topping up your monthly income. Or, for those lucky few who have blogs that really take off, it can become your main paycheck. But what are the key ways to make money from a blog? 19. Google AdSense Signing up with Google AdSense will enable you to make money from advertising on your blog. Google AdSense will place relevant ads around your site, and if your site visitors click on these ads, you will earn a fee. Although each click only amounts to small change, if your blog has high levels of traffic and lots of page views this will quickly amount to a reasonable sum. 20. Banner Adverts Creating space for banner ads on your website is another way to generate a revenue from adverts. However, for this type of advertising, you will need to contact businesses directly and ask them if they would like to advertise on your website. The upside is that you can charge a set amount, or even a recurring monthly fee, to business to promote their services on your site. Using a WordPress plugin like AdSanity is an effective way to manage this type of advertising. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard work, determination, and hustle. There are so many ways to make money as long as you have the mindset to stick to it. The best ways are to listen to people that complain, I know, no one likes a complainer. But if your at a table with say 10\u201312 people and 3 or 4 or 5 of them are all complaining about the same thing. Think to yourself, how can I solve that issue for them. Find a solution and then sell them the solution, people will pay you good money for solutions to pain points in they\u2019re lives. Big example is everyone wants to make more money, and in particular everyone wants to make it online and they want it to be easy. So I did a tonne of research on how to make and create money on the internet (literally hours and days of research), went and tested a bunch of them to see if I could make money with them. If I successfully made money then they stayed on the list, if not then they got crossed off. Now I use those methods to make extra money, and I have a gig on Fiverr where I sell those exact same money making ideas to people that want to learn how to make money on the internet. People are happy to pay me the $5 for my 10 money making ideas because they don\u2019t have to do the research to figure it out for themselves. So I have given them multiple solutions and ways to make money for a reasonable price, they\u2019re happy, and I get paid. I just did a youtube video on 2 money making methods, feel free to check it out. No cost involved, these concepts are 100% free. MAKE AN EXTRA $500-$1000 A WEEK - 2 EASIEST METHODS!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Step One: Decide what part of the world you hate worst and change it. Step Two: Pinch pennies. Example 1: you want to take someone out on a date. You've already decided you hate traffic. Do you go to the opera, with ticket price $80, followed by a Friday work rush commute downtown or do you meet at a public park with a river, take off your shoes and wade and then share peanut butter crackers and grapes? Example 2: one of my best friend's smoked weed all day long so she could just mellow out and she couldn't not smoke tobacco too. She never could understand why I never lacked money (we both had the same job and pay and hours) but I simply didn't have a $30 a week weed habit and a $40 a week cigarette habit and when I needed to get mellow I took the public park walk. Sometimes growing up and doing adult activities means giving up what your mind, heart and soul needs. Crayons only cost $20. Wealth is in what you value and receive back from investments in terms of time that meet your needs. ",

HorketHandBook is a great place to start your virtual assistant business today! 3. Teach English Online English is rapidly becoming the most dominant language in the world.

It also means that website testing is a legitimate way to make money online. That means an easy way to make cash online is to get paid to test websites. There are lots of different companies that offer this service. You simply log in and use the website for a period of time. You record your thoughts while you\u2019re using the website.

But running a store can be a complex process. After all, where you do store all the inventory that you\u2019re selling? The answer is drop shipping. Drop shipping means you don\u2019t keep your products around. Instead, the products are housed at a warehouse. When someone buys something from you, then you buy that same product from the warehouse and have it shipped straight to the consumer. That\u2019s why so many people think it\u2019s the best way to make money online! Even better, you can find dropshipping suppliers for lots of different products. Many T-shirt sellers, authors, artists, and more use drop shipping to sell their goods. You simply design the product and then people order it. The manufacturer sends it right to them. ",

Firstly, if we see the market as a house then you need to decide to earn money by fixing the house or building more. It\u2019s tiring and requires lots of intelligence to build new ones while there are always plenty of holes and cracks to fix. The world is vast so some needs may no longer exist at one place but at not others. You can eat healthy food while making yourself a millionaire selling junk food in underdeveloped countries. Secondly, the more intelligence, the more options you have and the more risk you can afford. Thirdly, the more risk the higher return. You earn more and occasionally faster from peddling drugs, dealing with mafia, selling contraband, trade arms, going to war, becoming a double agent, climbing up the political ladder, or simply opening a new market. Failure means as good as death. Your intelligence helps reduce the risk but of course there is the inherent risk. Fourthly, gather as much information as possible because information is money. With the right information, you can win a deal, open a trade route, cash in or cash out. Fifthly, to gather information you need relationship, and the only way to build relationship is to always be helpful. You can help your friend by trading information, assisting to capture an opportunity, or connecting him to a potential partner. Last but not least, before you can earn a lot of money, you must accept that in order to reduce risks, gather information, and build relationship, in most cases, you have to make sacrifices \u2013 love, family, hobbies.

The key is to become an expert or knowledgeable in something you are passionate about, and then using your knowledge to discover new opportunities for innovation. Don\u2019t trust any sources that claim to be an \u201ceasy\u201d way to earn \u201ca lot\u201d of money. Get rich quick doesn\u2019t really work in real life. A rare few actually manage to make their first million before they\u2019re 30. As far as making a lot of money is concerned, there are a few paths you can take: Go to college for a high-level degree in an in-demand field you have a passion for Start business ventures with the same mindset: in-demand and something you can get passionate about.

            "answer_text": "The best way to make a lot of money is through leveraging others people\u2019s time and money. This is the way of all great wealth. For instance, Bill Gates is wealthy because millions of other people buy his products. This is created by having thousands of people work for him. All great financial empires are built by employing others and finding or creating a market that engages others to either invest their time or spend their money. I believe it was Andrew Carnegie who once said, \u201cI\u2019d rather than 1% of 100 people\u2019s efforts, than 100% of my one.\u201d The problem for any of us as individuals of course is how to do this. Theory is simple. Reality is difficult. I spent the first 10 years of my business life trying to build my own businesses. I was planning to be a millionaire by age 30. By 30, I was closer to owing a million instead of having a million. I found a better way, through a concept called multi-level marketing, in which you can build a team of people who also want to use leverage. I have been paid through this system for the past 25 years, with no end in sight, in fact my business has grown 500% in the past 10 years without me doing anything - it is being built by other people who are building their own business. It\u2019s a greatly misunderstood business model to be sure, and has been subject to a number of scams and dishonest people who try to win by taking advantage of others, but when it is done ethically it is a thing of great equality. You can only get ahead in the long run by helping others get ahead. We all do the same thing. We are all partners with each other. It contains within its model the rare opportunity for money and the time to enjoy it. Once you have enough people in your team, building their own businesses, you can scale down your involvement, ofter to next to nothing. But you must find the right company, and the right organization of individuals in the field, the right training, to help you. To that end I have recently taken everything I\u2019ve learned in the past 25 years and put it into an online training system, called Creating Sustainable Incomes with E-Commerce. I will only work with people who are pre-qualified and have a better than average chance of success. To see if you qualify, take my Career Aptitude Test:  ",

Step By Step Guide: Find a motivated seller who is willing to sell a piece of property for what it is worth.Tell them you will sell it, buy an option on the house for $1 saying that you will purchase the house under the condition that you can find a buyer for a price greater than what you will \"pay\".Hold an aggressive marketing campaign to find interested buyers, possibly in an open-auction environment where the bid starts out low (the lower, the better, the more attention it will generate).  Print out lots of fliers, post them everywhere.  Host an open house auction over the course of 2 days.  Get the bidders to write down their contact info an open bid in your book.  Explain to them that this is like a poker game and that they do not reveal their true hand yet.After day 1, contact everyone on the list from highest bid to lowest and entice them to increase their bid.  Repeat this a couple of times until you can't get the price higher.Sell the option for the difference in the price you sold the property for and the price you agreed to buy the property for.  If you failed in getting enough interest or money, you're out of the $10 option and the cost of fliers - not a big loss.Save the names in your contact book in case you decide to do this again in the future.",

They aren\u2019t welcome in most communities and there is a negative stigma attached to people addicted to heroin and painkillers.  However, they are very profitable. A friend invested $400,000 in a methadone clinic less than 10 years ago. He recently sold the company for $20 million. That\u2019s a 50x return\u2026 I do not have any connection to methadone clinics but this story can be applied to other businesses. Take for example, this vacation rental in Panama City Beach.  It may not look like much, but it makes an estimated $28,900 per year in rental income.  Point is, the \u201cunsexy\u201d businesses have less appeal but it is for this reason that they can be lucrative investment opportunities.

What education do you have? What country and city do you live in? Are you willing to move? How good is your learning, intelligence, patience, willingness to adapt, willingness to put in the time and energy? And what is \u201chuge money\u201d to you? $100k, $500k, $1million a year? One path : Become a specialist surgeon in a western developed country. You\u2019ll need straight A\u2019s in high school and also university. Then commit yourself to working very hard to specialise and put in very very long hours learning, then qualify, then start your own practice then build a reputation as an excellent practioner then you can charge tens of thousands of dollars per surgery. It\u2019s a 20 year plan to execute though. Same sort of plan for lawyer, investment banker, accountant, management consultant. All of these require excellent grades in school, university, acceptance to top firms and very very hard work and long hours and you\u2019ll get there in the end once you make partner, bring in the clients and generate business. The vast majority of people lose money looking for get rich investing schemes, if it\u2019s too good to be true, it\u2019s too good to be true. CFD\u2019s, commodities, trading, forex are all very high risk options that will most likely result in you losing everything if you don\u2019t know what you are doing. Learning fundamental investing is the way to go but you also need to put in the time and energy to learn and start small and grow as you learn. You could start your own business. But the success rate is less than 5%. So not a safe option. It\u2019s a slow and steady route with lots of hard work to huge money, there aren\u2019t any shortcuts. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you need to identify what \u201ca lot\u201d means to you. For Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates, US$ 1M is not 'a lot' for them. How much money you think is 'a lot'? Because everyone has their own level of money and we cannot disagree with subjectivity. If you are at the age of 20 to 30, and you want to earn a lot of money, you can't just be an ordinary employee working at a company (unless you work at Google) to have a lot of money. I'm gonna give you an example of what you need to do if you live in my country, Indonesia. There are 3 types of occupation of rich people (20\u201330 y.o) which are; a. Entrepreneur Being an entrepreneur is the most absolute way to be rich, I mean if your business is successful. Being a successful entrepreneur is not easy as we the think, it takes longer than we think. In my country, most startup founder raises their success in 4\u20137 years depends on how good you execute the business. According to Fobes, 1\u2013100 richest man in Indonesia comes from business in many sectors. I also do business and it takes me 5 years to enjoy the money. b. Politician, and I don't want to talk about this but they earn a lot of money I have no Idea how (don't want to make assumption) c. Actor or Actress Yes, being an actor, or Social Media Figure is also an easiest way to be rich and earn that bucks of money. You can be an endorser, or everything to make a brand famous by selling your popularity. Again, it is not easy. No pain, no gain No sweat, no health No consistency, no money. Finding money if you are a self-employed takes longer than you think, but it's gonna be worth it some day. ",

Attention is the new age of currency, the more attention you get (whether that is from posts, social media, etc) the more opportunities you have to monetize off your traffic. When you have peoples attention, and you create a product, you\u2019re likely to make a sale. One of the biggest opportunities that I came across just recently is Amazon FBA. This is my main source of income, its purely online and its relatively easy, (nothing is get rich quick, it does require work) but in terms of every way to make money online, this is probably the fastest and easiest to generate full time income from. Basically what you do is source products from china in bulk (DIRT CHEAP) lets say I buy 200 units for the price of $1, and I send it to fulfillment centers (Amazon\u2019s) and I sell those products for $15, I make a $10 PROFIT. I have a lot of days where I make $100 a day, I sometimes wake up in the morning with 50$ profit, etc. I am 20 years old and I make more money than I ever would at any 9\u20135 rat race job. I am so lucky to have discovered this source of income, and I made a YouTube channel documenting how I created my business, how YOU can make your business scalable and getting you started within 2\u20133 weeks. This isn\u2019t a gimmick, this takes work, but if your willing to work at something, this is the best way to make money online. Hopefully this helped!  ",

If you are fortunate to get accepted into a great research university, go, and work your tail off, associate with other hard working people, and keep your eyes and ears wide open\u2026 If you are on your own or post grad, same rules apply. Read, associate with hard workers, keep your eyes and ears open. Integral to your self investment is to not be afraid of failure. Accept the fact that you will constantly fail and be frustrated on your journey. This skill is the secret to your success. Be persistent and never quit. Get a job, spend less than you earn, save money and accumulate your capital. Learn to be patient\u2026 persistent but patient. Find a problem, then solve it. Don\u2019t focus on money per se, become passionate about your solutions. A successful inventor once said of what he did, \u201cI create products that people did not know they can\u2019t live without\u201d. Wealth takes many forms. Not just money. You can be wealthy in people, family, friends, experiences, lifestyle\u2026 being wealthy is a mindset and state of being. Learn that. Respect everyone and treat them with dignity no matter what station in life they are. Believe that everyone has an idea, it\u2019s absolutely true. No group has a monopoly on ideas. A man/woman\u2019s character is most revealed by how they treat lower classes; servants, laborers, and others they think have nothing to offer. You will be surprised how wealthy your life can be when you pause and share a moment with a stranger. Finally, money is a tool. Having it is better than not, but do not let not having it limit your thinking or creativity. There is more money seeking good businesses than the other way around. When you have a pool of capital you will understand this concept. Cheers A ",

Now X has a product. The cost of manufacturing the product is 100bucks. Then the product is given to the trader at 150 bucks. The trader gives to the shops at 200, the shop gives it to us at 250. Now X chooses an another approach, it gives the product directly to the customer at 180 bucks. Both sides go home happy. Why one can do network marketing is, it requires only 5\u20136 hours of sincere effort in a week to generate an passive income over a year or two. If you're a student, house wife,engineer, doctor, pilot whatever. You can still do network marketing to generate an additional income source. All you need to be successful in network marketing is to be able to put in 6hrs of sincere effort every week consistently for a year. If you are able to persist after first 10\u201320 rejections,then you will surely be able to be able to succeed in this because you would have already heard all the reasons they told no to you and since the other conversation are going to be a repetition of the latter.

Kudos for the drones idea (unfortunately not applicable in my country), which was the only worthy idea I\u2019ve read before getting sick of the get rich quick schemes and other ponzis. So, ok, I released the pressure, no let\u2019s get to it. There is no easy/safe/fast way to make big bucks. But they are good, slow and efficient ways. I have seen both my father and my uncle make a few million in RE within a few years. My father was quite traditional in his approach : buy low with leverage, he built our home and saved the last floor to put on rent and netted a positive cashflow, etc. these kind of things that you\u2019ll find easily if you read about RE. My uncle, he went another way that I consider more interesting and worth sharing. He wanted to follow my dad\u2019s path and make money in RE. But he didn\u2019t had any capital and a low solvability that didn\u2019t allow any mortgage. Also he is an impatient man (and that ultimately cost him his fortune, twice). So they sat together on the table, discussed a few hours, and he came out with the following scheme. He built a renovation company. He started small, doing a few works for farmers he knew. After a while, he got enough money to buy his first unit through a second company. Obviously a ruin he bought for a penny on the dollar. Then, he hired his first company to do the renovation work for, well, a very competitive cost. Rinse and repeat, he soon owned several dozens of units (I have never known exactly how much, I believe a bit under the hundred). That without starting capital. Nor a fancy degree. ",

Others, do something that just happens to go viral for weird reasons and rapidly achieve wealth. Most of us have to save and invest slowly over time and guard against the pick-pockets and the absolute best way to do this, IMHO, is with M1 Finance - Free Automated Investing and I\u2019m not saying this just because we both get a $20 cash reward if you use my link to open and fund a new account with the minimum $100 before the end of July 2019. I\u2019m saying this because I, as a seasoned investor, am really impressed with the product. M1 is the only broker that will transact partial shares, as small as 1/10,000th of a share. This enables a beginner investor to have a complete portfolio of directly owned stocks and to dollar cost average into a substantial account over time. I will even give you an excellent set of stocks to own from the get-go, my Yield-Weighted-Dow pie. These are the Dow 30 stocks but instead of price-weighting I level the field by weighting the 10 highest yielding components at 4% and the lowest 20 at 3%. By owning the stocks directly you avoid all \u201cexpense ratio\u2019s\u201d which are hidden fees that intermediaries such mutual funds and ETF\u2019s pick your pocket with, ever so slightly, but add up to substantial amounts over time. Also, since nary a commission is charged when you add money to this account M1 dynamically re-balances to the specified weightings by adding a little more to the laggards and a little less to the leaders. A really clever scheme. Best Investing. -Allen ",

There are all kinds of websites that will pay you for various things, such as shopping, taking surveys or testing products. No, I\u2019m not getting paid to promote any of these and no, these websites won\u2019t make you a millionaire, but they are great for earning some extra cash. I\u2019ll leave out the scams. Here are some legitimate websites that pay: Swagbucks \u2013 Swagbucks is great for earning some extra cash. You can do a variety of things to make money, from taking surveys to using their search engine. You won\u2019t get rich, but you will earn a few bucks. If you have the time to kill, you can spend it earning some extra cash, instead of surfing the web.InboxDollars \u2013 InboxDollars is similar to Swagbucks, since you\u2019re going to be taking surveys, shopping, etc., so if you want to maximize your return, sign up with both websites. They also offer a search engine that pays you (like Swagbucks) and you get $5 just for signing up. I won\u2019t continue to list survey sites one after another down the list, but if you want to get paid to take surveys, also check out GlobalTestMarket, E-Poll Surveys and Survey Club.Project Payday \u2013 Project Payday is one of those sites that has testimonials of people who have earned thousands of dollars by getting paid to get trial offers. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll earn thousands, but it is legit and you can earn some extra cash. They assume that by paying you to do a free trial, you\u2019ll either like the product and purchase it, or forget to cancel the trial and get charged for it. If you can keep track and cancel before you get charged (if you don\u2019t want the product), then this is a great site for making some money.User Testing \u2013 User Testing pays $10 a pop for testing websites. A test usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The purpose is for a website owner to watch someone, who is new to their site, try to navigate it. The value that the site owner gets by watching an actual user experience is worth a ton, but $10 isn\u2019t a bad pay-out.Fiverr \u2013 Fiverr is a great place to make a few bucks or spend a few bucks if you need some of the services people offer. Basically, everything is $5. You either pay $5 or charge $5. They call them \u201cgigs.\u201d You can offer your services however you choose. If you sell art and you\u2019re fine selling pieces for $5 each, that\u2019s a gig. If you\u2019re a graphic designer and you want to offer your services for $10/hour, simply offer a 30 minute gig. If they need two hours of graphic design, they pay you $20, or $10/hour by buying four gigs.IZEA \u2013 IZEA works in addition to a blog or on its own. You get paid to blog, tweet, take photos and take videos. The pay is mostly based on your following, so if you want to make money with your tweets, you\u2019ll need to grow you Twitter following. Likewise, if you want to make money with blogs, you\u2019ll need substantial blog traffic (more on blogging below).2. Freelance Writing Freelance writing is one of the most popular ways to earn money online. Many successful freelancers can earn an average of 50 cents to a dollar per word. Some are earning twice that! Of course, it doesn\u2019t start out like that. You\u2019ve got to build your portfolio and your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, blah blah blah. If you\u2019re interested in writing, I\u2019m sure you know this. If you\u2019re not interested in writing, I wouldn\u2019t recommend traveling down this road just for the money. It takes dedication and time, though it can be highly profitable if it\u2019s what you love. Assuming it is what you love, let\u2019s talk about making money with it. Before you decide to start reaching out to all of these freelance writing companies, you need to have a web presence. You need a blog (in my humble blogger opinion, of course). Or you could just have an online portfolio. Even a LinkedIn profile works to get started. When you\u2019re ready to start, here are 150 resources to help you write better, faster and more persuasively. If that\u2019s intimidating, just start with these 50 resources. Now for what you\u2019ve all been waiting for; once you\u2019re ready to actually start making money, here are 10 websites you can start with: Listverse \u2013 Listverse pays $100 for each accepted post. The article must be a list, it must be at least 1,500 words and you must include at least 10 things. Other than that, you can get pretty creative with it.TopTenz \u2013 TopTenz pays $50 for each accepted post. Again, the article has to be in a list format and it must be at least 1,500 words, with few exceptions. They post often so your chances of getting accepted are fairly high.A List Apart \u2013 A List Apart pays $200 for each accepted post. They\u2019re not first on the list, because they tend to publish less articles, which means you have a smaller chance of getting accepted. Same guidelines as above, 1,500 word minimum.International Living \u2013 International Living pays $75 for each accepted post. They are mostly looking for travel experiences from countries you have visited. For this site, it\u2019s more about your experience than your writing ability.FundsforWriters \u2013 FundsforWriters pays $50 for each accepted post. They are looking for articles about writing and making money with it. They only accept articles between 500-600 words, but they want you to make each word count.Uxbooth \u2013 Uxbooth pays $100 for each accepted post. They do tend to take four to eight weeks to accept and post articles, so don\u2019t count on this being a quick money maker. They take so long, because they pair with editors to only publish amazing content.iWriter \u2013 iWriter pays up to $15 for each accepted post. That may seem small, but they aren\u2019t as strict as many of the others above and they also allow you to pick exactly what you write. You can write as many or as few articles as you want.Textbroker \u2013 Textbroker pays up to five cents per word, if you\u2019re a 5-star writer. You\u2019ll start by submitting a short sample article and you will most likely start as a 3-star writer, but you can work your way up by writing more and writing great content.Matador Network \u2013 Matador Network pays up to $60 for each accepted post, but standard pay is around $20-$25. They don\u2019t really focus on a minimum word count, but they have a maximum count of 1,500 words.The Penny Hoarder \u2013 The Penny Hoarder pays up to $800 (rarely), depending upon the number of page views you receive. The pay starts at $100 for 50,000 page views, so this isn\u2019t a guaranteed paid article, but it can potentially be highly rewarding.There\u2019s no doubt that you can make money with freelance writing, but it\u2019s a process. Once you start building your portfolio and your writing skills, you can start making some serious money. If you\u2019re not an experienced writer, expect to put some time in before you really start to see some dough. 3. Sell Your Stuff Ever since the idea of online auctions came into existence, the online selling market has been on the rise. Many are interested, but don\u2019t know how to get started. There are still all kinds of ways to make money by selling online, whether you\u2019re selling what you already have or buying and selling like a store. Before we get started, here are a few general tips when selling anything online: Get a PayPal account. If you don\u2019t have a PayPal account, you\u2019ll want to get one if you\u2019re doing business online. It\u2019s the standard in online business for receiving payment and paying others.Take good pictures. Some of the options below don\u2019t require you to actually take the picture and sell the product, but for the ones that do, make sure you take a clear picture that makes your product stand out from the others. If you\u2019re going to be taking a lot of pictures, set up a small \u201cstudio-like\u201d area in your home with a backdrop and proper lighting to really make your pictures come across as professional. And of course, you\u2019ll want a good camera too.Be honest. If you\u2019re selling used items, be honest about every dent, scratch, blemish, etc.. This will reduce many issues you could run into and keep your reviews positive.Do good business. Plain and simple. Whether you\u2019re selling on a small site or opening an online store, your customer service matters. You\u2019ll want to get those positive reviews and make a good name for yourself. Respond to questions, concerns and complaints. Offer a guarantee if available.Follow those guidelines and you will do well in online sales. When you\u2019re ready to start selling, here\u2019s where you go: Amazon \u2013 Have you heard of FBA? It stands for \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d and it\u2019s getting pretty popular. Basically, you buy products (in bulk is best) and ship them to Amazon for them to store. When your products sell, Amazon packs them up, ships them out and sends you the money (after taking their cut). There are people making a full-time living from FBA, while others just do it for some extra money.CraigsList \u2013 Some things don\u2019t ship very well. Other things may make you feel uncomfortable to sell to someone across the country. Anytime you\u2019re selling a large item or something you just don\u2019t want to ship, Craigslist is a great place to go. It\u2019s simple to list your item (again, take good pictures!). If you don\u2019t like the idea of putting your phone number out there, the interested individual can send you a message to your inbox without even getting your email address.eBay \u2013 Of course you can\u2019t read an article about making money online that doesn\u2019t mention eBay. You can start an eBay store and get serious about it or you can just sell some stuff to declutter your home. Either way, I\u2019ve made my fair share from selling on eBay and it\u2019s still a popular way to earn money. If you decide to start an actual eBay store, you\u2019ll want to find a drop-ship business like Doba that will store and ship items straight to your customers so you don\u2019t have to deal with an inventory.Etsy \u2013 If you like to create arts and crafts, you can sell them on Dove puoi trovare di tutto da creativi di tutto il mondo\u2019s completely free to open an Etsy store. You simply sign up, post pictures of your creations and starting selling. You can choose your payment option, but PayPal is generally the easiest. Etsy makes it easy to sell and keep track of your inventory. There is a small listing fee and they take 3.5% of every sale you make.Facebook \u2013 Facebook swap shops are great for selling things locally. It\u2019s like CraigsList, but a little easier. You simply search for swap shops in your area and ask to join the group. Once you\u2019re in, take a picture of the item, write a quick description with the price and post it. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. You can generally expect to get about what you would get at a yard sale, maybe a little more.I propose to you 3 ways ",

Anyway, if your sum of money available for investment is large, I recommend you approach a good financial advisor or a bank manager to suggest some investment apparatus which you can get involved in. Whatever you may decide, always remember that high returns always involve higher risks of investments. Always be safe than sorry. If you are unsure of what you have been recommended or that your gut feeling feels not right in certain investment advice, then move away from it. During the interim, simply placed your extra cash in fixed term deposits with banks, as they are usually safer in the long run. ",

I have a fundamental difference though\u2026 I agree that many individuals make a fortune on specific businesses that gain traction, choosing a proper demand in the market. However, I believe that the most solid way to consistently make money throughout your life (as opposed to start a business and find an exit) is to get solid, valuable, in-depth knowledge. A foundation that will always work, no matter what business you start, what market you\u2019re in and the market status at present (bear vs bull). I think that the absolute best way to gain knowledge is to read. You need to build a strong foundation of formulas that will always yield results. I am making this problem simpler by putting a list together, on my blog, of the best books on personal finance, business, economics and what not, on my blog: Books. I am committed to deliver 100 reviews and summaries of those books in 10 months (for which I will re-read many books up to a total of 100), in the recent future. If you think that pointing you to a specific business that is either hot right now or I believe will be hot in the future, then try to find something you can build quickly and cash out. I would like though to challenge you to make analogies with good doctors, lawyers, etc. And plus, why would you not want to learn from self-made millionaires like Robert Kiyosaki and Kevin O\u2019Leary?

            "answer_text": "In my experience the best way to earn money is online. There are a couple reasons for this. Firstly earning online gives you the flexibility to earn wherever you like (so you can be at home or travelling or staying with friends its) at times that suit you and can fit around your other commitments. Secondly, many ways of earning online (and in my view the best ones) allow you to build a passive income. Which means that work you do just once can continue to provide you with an income over and over again. This enables you to build and build your income over time and continue to receive money into your account even if you have to stop working for a while because you or a family member are not well for example, or if you just simply want to take bit of time out. Passive income is in fact the secret of the wealthy - people who are millionaire and billionnaires usually have a means of earning set up that does not depend on their presence to continue. This blog post sets out some great ways to make money online (please note that there are some affiliate links included). They are all tried, tested and genuine means of earning that you can get started on straight away and which don't require you to invest anything or risk any capital. I use many of them in my own online business. Some ways can earn you a few extra dollars others can earn you a serious income. They can be done from anywhere at any time with a laptop and internet connection. Some of them can even be done using a smart phone if you have a few minutes spare dug in the day. The best means of earning which will bring a proper return for your time, would be to do affiliate marketing. This affiliate marketing method of earning is where you promote someone else\u2019s products by sending web traffic to their sales page. You then earn commission when sales are made. There are many companies that offer the opportunity to work for them as an affiliate and they don't require you to pay to sign up. Amazon is a very popular affiliate programme, because so Amazon is so well known and reputable and sells so many products that it is relatively easy to make sales. With Amazon you can also earn commission on the value of a buyer\u2019s total basket rather than just on the value of the product you have promoted. There is a great FREE video series called \u201cHow to Sell Affiliate Products\u201d that you can access via the FREEBIES link in my bio. They were created by the person I believe to be the best internet marketer in the world, Sarah Staar. Sarah now kindly offers these videos as a free resource to those who are serious about making money online. She is a great teacher and very generous with the sharing of her knowledge. You will not be risking anything as these videos are FREE and give you ALL of the information you need to be able to get up and running with selling affiliate products. Best of luck ",

I have mentioned these types for you, so that you can choose the best one for you. Equity Funds: These are Mutual Funds that invest in market-linked instruments like stock market.

            "answer_text": "What I would do if I needed to earn lots of money is start finding a niche or an area that I might be an expert in or at least have some experience in. I would head over to Amazon and search for books in my niche and sort by popularity. Then look for the books that were the most popular and scan through the topics in the book and start jotting those down. Next I would check out the reviews for those books both good and bad and use that as an idea generator for what I will be creating next. Once I have my topic, subtopics and review data, I would head over to google slides and start putting together slides for my new online course. Once the slides have been completed, I would record the presentation and package it up as my new digital product. Finally I would reach out to friends, family and relatives and letting them know about my new online course that will help them with ________________. Of course since I have experience and an expert in my topic, I would price it at $997 and include a group coaching offer if its feasible. If people cannot afford my group coaching, they can still learn a lot from my self-study course without personal access to me. I just need to talk to as many people out there and focus on selling just five of my courses to hit my goal. :) I hope this helps! Faisal ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what for you is \u201ca lot of money\u201d. Let us assess the money a porn performer can earn by filming alone. There are several factors that have to be taken into account, and, of course, there is negotiation skill playing in. Generally, the more famous and the more popular an actor or actress and in this case, the porn performer is, the higher the payment per scene. The following figures are from the article \u201cPorn's dirtiest secret: What everyone gets paid\u201d: An actress is usually paid about $800 to $1000 for a traditional sex scene (boy/girl) at average, top stars can make up to $ 1500, in more rare cases (very popular actresses) up to $ 2000, while newcomers might earn a measley $ 300. More extreme sexual practices result in higher payments (I will come to that below). The average male performer makes $500-$600 per scene or day, well known male performers may earn $700-$900 and top stars up to $1,500. Payment also varies by the sex acts to be performed. The following figures are a rough guideline of what is being paid, taken from \u201cHow much money can you make? - How to be a Porn Star\u201d. These are rates for actresses, female performers, in LA or Las Vegas: Solo (or softcore photo shoot only) $150 \u2013 $350 Traditional sex scene (boy/girl) $600 \u2013 $1000 Anal (boy/girl) $1000 \u2013 $1500 Anal (girl/girl) $800 \u2013 $1200 Group Sex $1200 \u2013 $2000 Double Penetration \u2013 $1100 \u2013 $1400 You see, these three factors (sex, popularity, type of sex acts performed) already results in quite a wide range. And these are only the rates. Here you can make your first choice if they are making a lot of money per scene or not. Giving absolute numbers of total income is not easy, as the total income made on performing in porn films highly depends on the number of scenes - this means, an average male porn performer doing two scenes per week will make more money per year from filming than a top female star doing, say, one scene per month. But that is only one possible revenue stream. For female porn performers, other revenue streams are available like stripping or escorting. In addition, the \u201cmore extreme scenes\u201d to increase income is mostly, if not only, available to female performers. Thus, in a nutshell, female porn performers can do very well financially while the opportunities of male performers are limited, though their career can span a lot more years. As you see, there might not be an easy answer. But income is based on the amount of work done and you can play around with the figures above to estimate how much work needs to be done to make what you feel is \u201ca lot of money\u201d. If that is \u201ca lot\u201d or not is largely up to your definition of \u201ca lot\u201d. Hope that helps. ",

The chances that you will read \"any of those books\" even one is \"1%...i know you will not read them...it's your attitude, that's why you will never have what you want to have...you are blaming the world for your problems...being a victim...

Reading is like steadying your hand...everybody can have a sharp knife...but a not steady hand will cut it self...so you read so you can cut what needs to be cut...

The question, at the end of the day, is \"What are you willing to do about it?\" It's nice to dream and imagine these will be handed to you on a silver platter, but I think most people will tell you, from experience, that this rarely happens. My advice is to get off your butt, suck it up and do what is necessary to achieve your goals.  There is a sea of money out there.  All you have to do is go and get some of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I would take a very different approach than what most have recommended. I\u2019ve made multiple 7 figures online using this approach. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, many of the ways mentioned here work also. They just aren\u2019t the most efficient way\u2026 And they take a lot longer. With the way I\u2019m about to describe, you can earn your first $30\u201350 today if you set up it quickly and do it right. With the right amount of work it will turn into much more and can turn into a full-time business. I would do it all with Quora to start with. I would make that my single focus for the next 3 months. It will take some hard work, but the effects will start to compound over time. You can branch out into other channels once you see some success. Let me explain what I would do. * Before we get started it\u2019s extremely important that you\u2019re always adding value to your audience, and to the people on Quora, when doing this. Here\u2019s how. 1. Pick a good product or service that you have purchased in the past and REALLY believe in. Find a good product in a niche that ideally you know something about. I\u2019m going to take the \u201cmake money blogging\u201d niche as an example. I may have taken a particular course that helped me tremendously and helped me earn my first $1 online. Although a little expensive at the price point of $497, I truly believe that the course is great. It adds a tremendous amount of value that I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere in other courses. I apply to become their affiliate. I get a unique link that tracks everyone that I refer, and if someone purchases, I get 50% commission. This means you only need 3\u20134 sales a week to reach your target. 2. Create freebie that this audience would be interested in Now that I know which product I want to promote, I need to think of creating a useful freebie with awesome information. It\u2019s important that it\u2019s congruent with the product that I will be promoting. I\u2019m going to come up with a well-researched freebie called: \u201cThe Earning Potential of the Top 27 Blogging Niches\u201d I will give this away to anyone that is willing to sign up to my email list in exchange. 3. Set up a landing page to capture emails in exchange for this freebie Next, I set up a quick landing page using a page builder like ClickFunnels. Any other page builder will work fine as well - this is jus the one I\u2019ve had success with. My landing page will highlight all the benefits of this freebie, and how it\u2019s able to help my audience overcome their problem. Making money online by writing a blog. I will offer it to anyone that visits the page in exchange for their email address. 4. Update Quora Profile and show them where to download this freebie Next, I\u2019m going to update my Quora profile and add a link to the landing page with the freebie. I\u2019m going to showcase my credentials as a blogger and what I have achieved. Even if I\u2019ve only made $1 online, it\u2019s bound to be more than many others have done. I\u2019m going to use language that makes it irresistible for anyone that reads my profile to click on the link going to my landing page. This is where they will find the freebie. 5. Drive traffic by answering relevant Quora questions Now it\u2019s time to start driving traffic traffic to my profile. I\u2019m going to find relevant questions on Quora with anything that have to do with \u201cmaking money online\u201d, \u201cblogging\u201d, \u201caffiliate marketing\u201d. I\u2019m going to make sure that I only answer questions that have an answer to follower ratio of 1:5 to make sure that I get visibility on Quora. I\u2019m going to make my answers as in-depth and helpful as I possibly can to make that my answers get upvoted. I want to be at the top of every question I answer so that I get maximum visibility. I\u2019m also going to include a call to action for them to check out my profile in my answers, or where relevant, a direct link to my landing page. This will start driving Quora traffic to my landing page and help me build up my mailing list. Referall traffic from Quora is some of the most relevant traffic out there! 6. Create valuable content that helps your audience I\u2019m going to be emailing everyone on my list on a daily basis by setting up an autoresponder using a tool like ConvertKit. I\u2019ll be providing them with useful tips and insights on how to make money blogging that will really help my audience. I\u2019m also going to share little tidbits from my life to build a relationship with my audience. I want them to really get to know me as a person and to start to like me My audience will start to trust me and view me as an authority. 7. Promote the product that has helped you Every three days or so, I will mention that I was able to learn how to make money blogging through the course that I am an affiliate for. I will recommend my audience to check it out and click on the link that I will put at the bottom of my email. To entice them further, I will also add a special bonus for anyone that ends up purchasing the course through my link. I\u2019m going to offer a 30-minute coaching 1-on-1 call to anyone that purchases the product through my link. I will show them exactly how I used the program to make my first $1 online and give them tailored suggestions on how they can do the same. This will drive many of my audience to purchase the program through my affiliate link. This is when I\u2019ll start making my first commissions. 8. Add in other traffic sources Only once I\u2019ve made a few sales and have started making money would I add in other traffic sources. If you don\u2019t have a converting offer, spending time on things like SEO, paid traffic, and all of the other suggestions made here - is likely a HUGE waste of time. Only once I have proven that my idea works, and my offer converts, I will focus on these. Conclusion Doing this every day will very quickly get you your first $30 day online using traffic from Quora. Then shortly after to a level of $50 per day. And eventually it could become a full-time business. And the good news is that you\u2019ll be building your OWN email list and your OWN audience. No one can ever take that way from you! You can do this in any niche - whether it\u2019s make money online, weight loss, or dating. As long as you are one step ahead of your audience in their journey, you\u2019re able to help them. The most important thing is to be genuine with your audience and help them solve THEIR problems. I was ultimately able to use many of these strategies to grow my own business to 7 figures also. And was finally able to quit my job and live life on my terms. And I\u2019m going to start a case study where I\u2019ll do exactly this by growing a brand new blog to $10,000 per month in only 12 months. ",

Going back to history there were various forms of value as money such a gold coins, and even before that if you go back to the time where there used to be a barter system where people used to trade goods and commodities. Has anyone thought about how a person was measuring value even before that? Let's go back into the evolution, an early man one who could lit the fire was been expected by others to do that work again and that's where the person who knows how to lit the fire had value for. For the above-mentioned context, the main aspect come into picture whether it's during the early man period or now is EDUCATION and KNOWLEDGE. Gain the knowledge and educate yourself to most of your capabilities and am sure there's nothing better ASSET in this world other than knowledge which could get you lots of returns for a much longer duration. If you look out for the short term benefits or expect to think in a smaller duration for more money, I can assure you it doesn't stand with you for a longer time and it's going to be temporary in your life. Acquire as much as the knowledge you can and am sure it can make wonders and bring you more and more money and remember miracles do not happen overnight. No businessman or a rich person in this world has earned money without knowledge. \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS THE KEY FOR A ROOM WITH MONEY BEING LOCKED\u201d ",

If you are looking for a way to make a lot of money fast, something along these lines would be best: cutting lawns: cutting lawns is such a good way to make a little bit of money. It may seem hard, but all you have to do is go to the closest neighborhood to you and knock on dooors. If you can get 10 people to pay you $25 for every time you cut, if you cut every week you will be making an extra $250 every weekCar washing/detailing: washing cars is another good way to make money. You can go door to door and ask if they would like you to wash your car. Depending on the neiborhood, you could probable charge $15\u2013$20. Knock on 50 doors and 20 say yes, you just made $300\u2013$400 in a single day! If you want to do more, you can it every day!If you\u2019re looking for something more long term, something you will be able to earn a living in and retire on, something like this would be better: Start a blog: blogging has a huge potental to earn a lot of people a lot of money, but few people know how to succeed at it. Blogging will give you a level of freedom that no other profession can and it has to potental to earn a lot of money as it\u2019s not rare to hear of bloggers that are making $1,00,000 a month for wherever they want in the world! I have wrote a blog post on this, if you would like to see it, you can visit the post.Write an e-book: writing an e-book is something that anyone on any budget do now. If you don\u2019t want to wire a book, you can hire a ghost writer on Fiverr. A ghost writer is someone who writes for you on any topic and let\u2019s you claim the rights to it. This means that someone else is writing a book and you don\u2019t have to gov them credit or royalties on the sales. Ghost writers can be tied for as cheap as $5 for 500 words. After that, you can sell you book using advertisements, or you can sell it over the phone. Let\u2019s say you make $15 on every book you sell. If you called 20 people every hour and 25% of them buy your book (which is realistic for phone sales), then you will be makeing $75 an hour. Hire 15 salesmen and give them 30% commission, then you\u2019re earning $787 times whatever number of hours they work! I mension this in one of my blog posts and go further in depth if you would like to read it.I have more ways of making money both short term and long term on my blog if you would like to learn more.

He has made $80 billions using the power of compounding. I can't tell you the ways to make a lot of money but I can tell you a way to grow your money and to a point when you can retire using the compounding effect.  Now the question is, how this can be done? I'll advise you to start SIPing into any good index fund, invest 20% of nomatter how much you earn for next 20 years and believe me you'll be rich. Do you know that \u20b910000 rupees invested every month for next 20 years at 17% CAGR will become \u20b92 crore.  And that's a lot of money. You'll be a part of top 1% richest people in India. ",

Doing a budget is mandatory to see what you need- though that obviously changes with age, marriage, kids, jobs and so on. Then you have retirement. It is a \u2018major\u2019 item since it keeps on changing. However, you want to stay ahead of the game by earning more than you need. But that is for emergencies, health issues, etc., You do not have to become rich- whatever that may mean. Living in San Francisco is obviously much different than Boise.

Get proper education if you are in early teenage and master it whichever stream you are in.Try to find a job in the major what you have studied in.Continue growing in your line of study and make more money.If you are not satisfied with the money you made in Step.3 then make some good savings and start your own business or take help of a franchise to build your own.Build a brand/quality product under your own business and start franchising your own business to others. ( This is how Mcdonalds,Starbucks are making money today and you/me wil be seeing long queue lines infront of them. )If you are lazy to work hard then you will never make money rather than thinking about it. People who come from a rich background would not really know the actual value of money because they already have enough to survive unless its taught by their parents. These are few tips which I posted but there could be many other ways as well. ",

The other side of the equation is being frugal and investing your money. Below are two different 24 year olds starting out in life. one starts with a $35k/year job and one starts with a $70k/year job. Both are wise and invest 15% of their salary into their 401k each year and get a company match. When they are 65, they have both gotten enough for a decent retirement.  But the one starting at $70k, will live much more comfortably. ",

Then he thought the nest was the world, until he could peek out and then he thought the tree was the world, until he fell out of it. The point is, the world is big. If you step out, you will find something about it that you like. Now about making money, it depends on your skills. Find out what are 'you' good at. What are you good at, and what you might like to learn. Do it well and you'll be able to make money eventually. ",

I have bought the package and basically you receive a personal link to a set of videos the detail exactly what you do. Not started yet, but it seems easy to follow. Plus I got some bonuses too! It was suggested to me by a friend who has made $217 in the last 4 days and only bought it last week. Here is a video that explains more and a link to download the package for about $8. If you don\u2019t get it, you can have a full refund, so its a win win situation.  Hope that helps :) Nigel Clarkson ",

Presently, the World wide web has made sports betting available to anyone and everyone, as long as you have a bank card. It has attracted all types of people from die-hard sports lovers to people who hardly watch sports at all. In order to find the big success, it is important for any bettor to avoid the little mistakes people are making, and continue to make. It is equally important to show patience. With over a thousand games a season for each sport, you should have plenty of opportunity to make some money. There is no need to bet on every game and if you do not feel confident placing a bet, then don't. There will always be more games that week. ",

You may find that your online business requires you to invest 30 minutes to 10 hours per month, but you yield a 30 - 40% return on your investment. This is something which a lot of successful entrepreneurs do, or you could do it side-of-desk whilst working through those less active days in the office.

So I\u2019ll let you know how I think is the best way to make lots of money online as a beginner. My two favorite ways to get started making money online are with Kindle Publishing and Merch By Amazon. They are VERY beginner friendly and the perfect way to get started with making money online. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make $10,000 + per month with these businesses because you definitely can. With Kindle Publishing, simply put, you hire writers to write books for you which you then publish and sell yourself on Amazon. Merch By Amazon is similar where you sell t-shirts on Amazon. Just make some designs (or hire someone to make them for you, that\u2019s what most do) and upload them to Amazon with a title and description. That\u2019s it! These are the two main businesses that we talk about on our YouTube channel and it is what has allowed us to be full time \u201cmake money onliners\u201d and travel the world. Please look into these two businesses if you are looking to get involved with online business. Thank me later! Lol hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have a passion for writing? Another way of earning money online is by blogging. Blogging is a way of expressing yourself by writing on blog sites that are publicly seen. Many bloggers choose a particular topic to write on, like travel, food, technology, culture, etc. So, if you have a certain interest, passion or expertise, then consider blogging as your next hobby. There are two ways of setting up an account for blogging. You can register yourself in a blog site like Google, or you can buy a domain for yourself. If you are using your own domain then approach businesses for sponsorship and offer them an advertising space. Ask them if they would like to have their banner or logo displayed on your website for a price.  Read More at: A little secret to making a lot of money ",

            "answer_text": "In a way, the best way to earn money is to not to get behind the money. Instead doing what you love and regular improvement in that will always gives you money. In today\u2019s world there is money in every field but as i said earlier you should be able to detect the field that you love which most of the people fail to do and end up in broken when continuing the same profession for a longer period. For these kinds of people changing jobs continuously until they find the right one is always the best solution. Let\u2019s look into some statistics: 1.The International survey asked \"Which of the following best describes how much you love your current job?\" The Indian workers came up with the following responses: 18% Love it - would do it for free( But anyway you will get money)37% Like it a lot - I enjoy what I do, but I could like it more33% Like it - I like it well enough for now5% Don't like it - I think I could do better0% Hate it - but it is a necessary evil8% Did not answer2. According to a 2012 survey conducted by \"Big 4\" accounting firm Deloitte, 80% of those surveyed did not like their jobs. In another survey conducted by Gallup in 2013, 63% of the 230,000 employees in the survey said they were unhappy with their jobs. 3.Here's some of that data: 96% of the poor did not like what they did for a living.86% of the rich liked what they did for a living.7% of the rich loved what they did for a living.But for Indian\u2019s they are so lucky. A recent International survey data that looks at levels of job satisfactions among Indian workers shows that over half of the workers (55 per cent) love or like their job, placing India at third position in International Happiness Rankings, behind Canada and the Netherlands. According to the survey, one in five Indians love their job so much and no Indian worker says that they hate their job. i.Rich people who liked their job Eighty-six percent of the rich people in my Rich Habits study liked what they did for a living. It's clear, from my data, that in order to become wealthy you must at least like what you do for a living. Those rich people who at least liked what they did for a living accumulated an average of $3.4 million. It took them thirty two years to accumulate their wealth. ii.Rich people who loved their job Only 7% of the rich people in my study loved what they did for a living. But what shocked me was how important loving what you do for a living is to wealth accumulation. Those rich people who loved what they did for a living accumulated an average of $7.4 million, or $4 million more, than the wealthy who liked their jobs. It took this group of rich people twelve years to accumulate their wealth, or twenty fewer years than the first group. From my research regarding pursuing a dream job: When you love what you do for a living, you'll spend more time doing it.When you spend more time doing what you love to do for a living, you'll get better at doing it.When you are better at what you do than your competition, the world will pay you more money.When you make more money than your competition, you can accumulate more wealth in a shorter period of time.The final lesson, I believe, sums everything up: If you want to become richer quicker, find a job that you love and never quit.For some professions you can consider Actor, Athlete, Physician/Surgeon, Investment Banker, Engineering Manager, Software Developer/Software Architect, Product Management Director,Actuary, Corporate Lawyer.

For you to get an affiliate commission, you have to have traffic (customers), direct them to your offers (affiliate products) and when they sign up or purchase that offer, you get the commission, also known as affiliate commission. You can use ether free traffic or paid methods to drive traffic. Now free traffic isn\u2019t free at all. You will have to either set up a niche website or a social media page with lots and lots of followers. And it freaking takes time.

Making money is a hobby to the wealthy and they pursue it with the same passion as poor people pursue social media to read about the rich and watch videos about the rich. Money needs attention and love, the rich worship at the altar of accumulation. Simply put: if one imitates what a wealthy person does : smart work, network, astute decision making and saving plus reinvesting, one is surely to end up wealthy. Increase your sphere of opportunity. Leave the boundaries of your daily life and expand that sphere by another 100 miles. I bet you will meet something and someone new that will change your life forever.

It will take you 3 or 4 months to learn and start doing deals, but if you are doing it in the USA, your income per deal will be $3k to $10k and actually take 8 to 10 hours of work. If you learn how to bring in a consistent stream of seller financed deal leads, and have an understanding of how to make these offers, you can build a business that will feed you the rest of your life. Once you learn how to do this, you can also start keeping some of the properties rather than flipping them all. This will allow you to build a portfolio of properties - which is what makes you rich. I write a blog on this topic, have written a few books on Amazon and I teach this subject. But most of all, I do this myself and it has given me a life of freedom and allowed me to pursue my dreams.

Complete the mission within the slowest time attainable, then still lower your record by one second on each succeeding try, doubling your prize anytime.

Make more by working hard, studying or learning new skills if this leads to a higher paid job or finding other (legal) ways to make extra cash. Don't spend money when you don't need to, make your own lunch, don't buy expensive things that you don't need. If you mean I have a lot of money what should I do know - the above would still apply plus put it somewhere safe preferably somewhere it earns interest. ",

Study investment opportunities in stocks, real estate and businesses like new tech. Learn how to sell so that you can trade great products with customers. Then once you can sell, sell expensive products for a high commission. Cars and houses are two of the best, most expensive things a salesperson can sell. No experience is required for selling cars but you would need to study to become a real estate agent. ",

Yes, it sounds a bit wierd and to vague, but the fact is that we all are gifted, thatwe can read, write, pray, love etc. The desire to wanting to have more is conditioned by our envioronment, peers etc., to also feel a sense of self worth. So, just like Rome wasn't built in a day, whatever you do, your financial status wont change much in a day. Just spend few minutes in deep thought and think of your strenght and work towards sharpening it. As you embark on the process, you would be able to get in a position ask for a better salary, higher fees etc.  But the real game changer would be when you really engage your brain to think of new ideas every day. Its an idea muscle which has to be forced to work every day. Your brain is themost powerful instrument in the whole universe! Just give it a try... All the best! ",

So what you can do right now is Choose a niche(market) to get into and secontly find something to giveaway like an online ebook or free video in exchange of the personas email and this is done through a squeeze page ( one page website where the person have to enter his name and email in exchange of something ) When you have this ready start sending traffic and people to see your optin page until you collect your first 1000 leads and if you do your stuff correctly you will bank 1000$ from this list or more because the average earning per email per month is 1$ per sub per month or more some of my funnels converts at 12$ per sub per month insane right ? That\u2019s because i sell 3000 and 5000$ products Ahhhh i forgot to tell you that you can start collecting those 1000 leads for free using forums and your social profile to send those people to see your optin page . If you don\u2019t know right now how to get 1$per sub each month and build this optin page and all this stuff you can join my students and watch FREE video series where i will share with you how to start your email marketing campaign from scrach you can go watch it here if you want -> http://bit.ly/online-incometraining ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to grow your money financially. Here are some areas which may want to consider\u2026 put your excess cash in high-yield interest offering accounts, such as fixed or variable term deposits with banks,invest in assets or properties which are safe and would yield higher returns in terms of rental yields and capital appreciation,invest in stocks and unit trusts that are safe and have good growth potential,invest in businesses or startups that you feel have good future and business potential\u2026There are lots more investment initiatives in your country, I am sure, but the list above would give your some idea. Anyway, if your sum of money available for investment is large, I recommend you approach a good financial advisor or a bank manager to suggest some investment apparatus which you can get involved in. Whatever you may decide, always remember that high returns always involve higher risks of investments. Always be safe than sorry. If you are unsure of what you have been recommended or that your gut feeling feels not right in certain investment advice, then move away from it. During the interim, simply placed your extra cash in fixed term deposits with banks, as they are usually safer in the long run. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer is ok One instantly came to my mind \u2014 The Radium Girls. They were a major factor in the labor codes as we know it today. It\u2019s the story of how during WWI, women went to work in the factories to replace the men who had gone off to fight. Some factories produced clocks, which the women would paint with radium, which glowed. Back then, some of the women who worked in the factories glowed due to exposure to the radium \u2014 and that was considered fashionable. The process goes to paint each clock goes like this: the girls would dip their paintbrush in the radium paint. They would then put the radium-coated brush in their mouth to create a fine point, and then apply the paint. They did this for every single clock \u2014 meaning hundreds, thousands of times. When the women began to experience the effects of putting radium into their bodies, the companies denied it, leading to a court battle (The women had even asked if it was safe to work with radium, which the companies assured them it was) The one fact I remember the most is how the women continued to testify, even as they were lying on their deathbeds, knowing that it might be too late for them. They did it for the future workers, even as they faced horrifying side effects (radium weakens the bones. One doctor broke a girl\u2019s wrist just by examining it; another doctor was able to pull a girl\u2019s jaw out with no surgical equipment) Eventually the Radium Girls won after a long court battle \u2014 marking one of the first times a company was held responsible for their workers\u2019 safety. I\u2019m surprised I never learned this in history class. ",
