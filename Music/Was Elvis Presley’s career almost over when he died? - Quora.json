            "answer_text": " Elvis was preparing for a sold out tour, no his career wasn't over, here we are looking at a man who ruled the Rock n Roll Airwaves, millions of records sold, hit movies through the late 1950\u2032s, his career hiccupped for two years in the army, that is physically touring but his crafty manager, an illegal immigrant from Holland kept his face in the news and released pre-release and unreleased material for the public during his hiatus. Army duties over, hot movies, some new hot records, somewhat quagmired in B-grade movies in Hollywood, still charting during a period of BEATLEMANIA, folk music, heavy metal, (later disco) has a comeback special during this vibrant period and in amongst the political war-mongering, civil rights and unrest, he records \u201cIn The Ghetto\" about hungry little black babies with runny noses in the street as cold winds blow. The Beatles were like wet-pantied little girls when they met their hero, their cute long hair styles matched their awe of Elvis. late 1960\u2032s A return to live touring, perhaps bigger and better, flashier outfits and musicians, the guy who played guitar on all Ricky Nelson's hit records, James Burton, joins his band. Whitney Houston\u2019s mama, Cissy Houston leads his all black female gospel quartet, J.D. Sumner and the Stamps even up to the end the only thing stopping or slowing Elvis was an apparent disregard for his personal health. He would have continued on as long as he wanted to and if his voice held out, sellout concerts, merchandise were the determining factor. As for me I was a 13 year old high school boy in August 1977 who like all fans and others was totally shocked that Elvis Presley could be dead. I grew up thinking Priscilla was a bitch, Lisa Marie was a lonely little girl with no siblings and Elvis's doctor was fucked. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe we can answer this from a different perspective. What are the patterns in his career? First a quick and fast high, based on his gut and raw authentic need to express himself. Then some life events, like the army, death of Gladys and relationship with Priscilla, and his established fame, made that he grew older, got wiser, and more withdrawn. Also then he signed his movie contract with a different kind of song. He had trouble then connecting with the musicbusiness as it evolved. Then he made his comeback\u2026modern, raw, a combo of Elvis as in his fifties and the typical sixty feel. He was fresh and happy, got married and got a kid. He liked performing again and so he did. 1000 shows in 8 years. Then another live event made an negative impact on his life, the divorce in 72. Not very strange he had his last number one hit in 72. Again a period where he withdrew himself, questioning himself, but also a wiser, older man, with interests for spirituality, looking for the meaning of (his) life. Fed up with the routine, especially the recording studios. His life was not run by his heart and his authentic self, but by the business, by what is asked of him by others. He knew, but couldn't handle or change it. And this led to living another life, sickness, restlessness, medicine, and death. If he hadn't died, the other scenario would be that he would have found a way, new energy, like in 68. Probably leading to less concerts, but making music his way. Undoubtedly this would have led to more interest for his songs and would have lifted his career. ",
