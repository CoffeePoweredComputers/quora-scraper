            "answer_text": "Loud speakers merely convert electrical energy into acoustic energy through the principles of electromagnetic induction, enabling signals in the analog domain to be perceived by us as sound. The amplification process usually happens in a power amplifier, connected just before the speaker in the audio signal chain. However, most speakers nowadays come with power amplifiers built in . ",
