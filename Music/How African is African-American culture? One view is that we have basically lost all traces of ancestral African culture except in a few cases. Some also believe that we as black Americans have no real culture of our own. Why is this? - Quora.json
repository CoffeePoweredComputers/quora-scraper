            "answer_text": "What people agree on is that African and African-American culture is different due to the fact that African American culture is firstly American culture, so obviously American culture cannot be African culture. This is not a matter of dispute or debate. Secondly, most African Americans have a percentage of white ancestry in them, research has determined that most have at least 70% sub Saharan African ancestry. Obviously there are those with less percentage of sub Saharan African ancestry. In Southern Africa, we also have mixed race people, they aren't called Black, they are called Coloureds. This is what the colonial masters decided, not African people. Some Coloureds prefer the Black label, some prefer the Coloured label. As you can see, the Coloured community in Southern Africa has identity issues. African Americans have their own identity issues too.A tribal African has no identity issues, he or she belongs to a certain tribe which follows its own tribal culture. So there are two categories of culture in Africa, the tribal culture and the Coloured culture. Of course, white Africans have their own culture, including Indians. An African American coming to stay in Africa would identify more with Coloured culture. Of course, if you want to immerse yourself in tribal culture you can. It's your choice. Situations like marriage will require you to immerse yourself in tribal culture. How African is African American Culture? Black Americans like Dane Calloway, attempting to appropriate Native Indian culture, putting out conspiracy theories about the non-existence of the slave trade and claiming to be Aborigines or Pacific islanders are a shame to the world. Okay, so you didn't originate from Africa, why are you telling us? What is the purpose of campaigning against Africa when you live in the USA? With or without the African American label you are still vulnerable to racial prejudice, profiling and police brutality that is part of the American system. The American system treats you the same whatever you call yourself. Weren't you suffering from racial discrimination before the Jesse Jackson era of African Americanism? Last time, I captured this screenshot on social media:  People like Dane Calloway don't give much attention to incidences like this. They focus on divisive conspiracy theories that divide the black people of the world. So what good is getting 4 million views on conspiracy theories instead of getting views against police brutality and racial profiling? The next day, I got another screenshot: I see them on a daily basis:  Are you too weak to confront these issues? Look, great African Americans like Martin Luther, Malcolm X and Jesse Jackson never dissed their ancestral land of origin. They had respect for Africa. They were man enough, capable of organizing a million-man march that reverberated around the world. You, the Jussie-Smollet generation will do anything to sell out your identity for money and fame. You have no respect for the civil rights struggle and pioneers. You have no wisdom. Youtube fame is corrupting you. You think you can go on Youtube, say whatever you want to get attention and fame. No wonder why in this generation we have no great civil rights activist in the mould of Malcolm X, Martin Luther or Jesse Jackson. You are social media whores, lost, confused and no guts to confront real issues affecting Black Americans. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea that cultures are so very distinct is a recent invention in America. The most overwhelmingly significant distinction of \u2018culture\u2019 is language. The second is law. The third is religion. People marry. Have children. Bury their parents. These things are all the same worldwide, but they are done in different languages, according to different regulations with different religious rites attending. But is it really that different? The term African-American, in fact, was coined among academics precisely because that \u2018race\u2019 of people could not be squeezed into \u2018black history\u2019. These people did not call themselves \u2018black\u2019 before the 1960s. Before then, they were Negroes. Before then, they were Coloreds. So in fact, you could call these three separate cultures covering just 5 generations. So yes you can definitely say the use of language, the context of law and the rites of religions have changed over the past 120 years, but are they really that different? As to the matter of \u2018real\u2019 culture, well I don\u2019t thing most Americans study enough to make an educated distinction, but there are millions of distinctions and people decide to draw attention to them all the time. So if you can say that Rock & Roll (People singing in English with guitars and drums in 4/4/ time about love) is different than Country (People singing in English with guitars and drums in 4/4 time about love), then yes every identifiable set is a real culture. So they\u2019re all distinct and real, but are they really that different? Keeping in mind that Pan-Africanism was a failed experiment to establish cultural and political exchanges between African blacks and American blacks, there isn\u2019t much left to be said about a shared culture. But there is no great need for that, nor any great call for it. Those few Americans who go to live in Africa and those few Africans who come to live in America aren\u2019t making large impacts on either continent. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is problematic. You seem not to understand the meaning behind the word African-American. The word doesn't imply and is not meant to define anything about culture. It refers to your ancestral origins, not culture, that is blacks of the African slave trade ancestry. Your culture is American and black American, your ancestral roots are African. I don't think this is hard to understand even for an elementary school kid. If the United States slave traders had opted to enslave Indians instead of Africans, the succeeding and current generations of Indians would be called Indian Americans. I am not talking about native American Indians. There is a big country called India in Asia with over 1 billion people. A lot of people who are confused by terms and identities are people who don't read. That's why we have so many ridiculous questions and confusion in the community. I also believe the American education system is sub-standard, there is a lot of people from that side asking questions that you can easily google up by yourself. I am subscribed to various topics on Quora including subjects like Mathematics. What I observed is that some people like making simple things difficult. Somebody will provide a long winded solution to a mathematics problem that needs a simple and straightforward method of calculation. Now, let me talk about African influence in the world: Dance and Music A lot of the sexy dance styles in Latin America, South America, Caribbean and North American islands are influenced and originating from African dance. And no, it's not Black Americans who came up with the booty shaking, twerking trend that is being done by every big butt girl on Instagram and Facebook. Africans have been booty shaking, twerking and doing sensual pelvic gyrations for quite a long time. It's been done as a ceremonial dance as well as a bedroom secret that elder women teach to young women looking to spice up their sex life. Twerking is common among various African tribes including the African Malay Arabs. It was long practiced before the colonization era. It comes in different names:    It's called Baikoko in Tanzania and Kenya Mapouka in Ivory Coast Massinguitane in Mozambique Sabar / Lembeul in Senegal Funana in Cape Verde Chakacha / Kata Kiuno / Viuno \u2013 among the Swahili Niiko in Somali Kawitry in Malagasy Afro-Arab Malaya dance Chaabi Chickat in Morocco ",

Over 250 cultures. On a fraction of a coastline. And African Americans are not really different in this regard. African Americans in New York, DC, and Florida have great cultural differences. But how like the various African peoples are we? Well for starters we still have the vestiges of a tonal language. African American Vernacular English is largely somatic and tonal. Our means of religious expression is a carry over from our ancestors. Our reverence for our mothers. Many of our social taboos. \u201c One view is that we have basically lost all traces of ancestral African culture except in a few cases.\u201d For anyone to be able to say that they'd need to have some knowledge of African cultures. By show of hands, who can tell me the relationship between the E\u03c5e, the Asante, and the Akeyem is so important to African Americans? Anyone who cannot answer that question can even enter into this conversation with you. \u201c Some also believe that we as black Americans have no real culture of our own. Why is this?\u201d Because you cannot look for salvation within if the savior is outside. ",

I have many African American friends, Even the \u201cFamily\u201d my wife and I chose to belong to (as much as the chose us too), is African American. The point is, I am more than familiar with African American culture. I have also been to Africa on several occassions while touring with different bands. I can safely say there is no similarity AT ALL between mainstream African American culture and African culture. Though many African Americans live in poverty and over-policed but still crime riddled communities. It doesn\u2019t begin to compare to Africa. Nor does the music or art created by African Americans represent Africa in any way. Why would it? Very few of those families have seen Africa in generations/ hundreds of years. However claims that African Americans have no culture (which I\u2019ve never heard before this question) is patently false. Rap is culture (not one I like, but it is culture)! R&B is culture. Jazz is culture (though not entirely built African Americans they made huge contributions to it). The Blues is culture, that spawned the most dominant, diverse, and global culture the world has ever seen Rock\u2019N\u2019Roll. Maya Angelou, and hundreds of other African American poets and Authors are culture. To claim African Americans have no culture is just fantasy, because TRULY AMERICAN CULTURE IS AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE because their contribution and influence is part of nearly all aspects of American Culture. It is an easy argument to say they have contributed more to the arts amd culture of this country more than any other minority ever has! ",

I am not being disparaging towards any of the Hamitic tribes because there is a history between us and them. Not all so called African Americans are the same either, so that term is also null and void. Yes, we came from the continent, but we are a different ethnic group. Our culture was never lost, it was forbidden and hidden. Our ancestors were not allowed to practice their culture and customs, the very things that made them who they were. It's like everything else that defined our people, it was substituted for the culture, customs, language and names of their oppressors. We have a culture and always had one. We not only have tribal names, but a national one as well. Only those who hid our culture from us tells us we have none, to keep us separated as a people. We were stronger together and always was. All it takes is reading, research and lots of time, and you will find all you need to know. Most of our families have oral history that will aid in your research. Ask them about your families history. There is a saying, \u201cIf you want to hide something from black people, put it in a book.\u201d The truth is out there if you really want to find it. When it comes to us, there is a rabbit hole that never seems to end. There has been a lot of time, effort and money put in to hiding who we really are. READ! And you will find your answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I talk about the ridiculousness of the term \u201cAfrican Culture\u201d, let me first say that all societies on this planet have a culture. Everyone. Why is that? Culture is simply the way of life of a people. Now think about this for a second. What group of people has no way of life? Even corporate entities have a culture. This brings us back to the latter part of the question. Of course, black Americans do have a culture, vibrant and widely popular one at that. As to how African that culture is, well, um\u2026 it's not. African-American culture is essentially American pop culture. It was created by Americans from an American perspective. The only thing African about it is that it was created by a group of people who share the same skin colour as black Africans. That's it. Now let's come back to the term \u201cAfrican Culture\u201d. What exactly is it? Africans do not think about their culture as a single monolith. Our cultural identities are based on our ethnicities and not on the entire continent itself. Even people in the same country don't think of themselves as coming from the same culture if they belong to different ethnicities. Well, some countries like mine (Ghana) may have a collective Ghanaian identity, however, at heart, we still acknowledge our different ways of life according to our ethnicities. If I were African-American (a term which has always baffled me by the way), I will not worry about how African my culture is. You already have one \u2014 a rather cool one at that. As to which one is better, muhhahahaha, maybe another time. ",

            "answer_text": "To add to all the other answers, I\u2019d like to draw attention to the Gullah people in the South Carolina (and formerly Georgia) Lowcountry and Sea Islands. The Gullah people have been able to preserve much of their African cultural heritage because of climate, geography, cultural pride, and patterns of importation of enslaved Africans. Enslaved persons from the Central Western region of Africa, originating primarily from the Mende populations of what is today Sierra Leone, and transported to some areas of Brazil (including Bahia), the enslaved Gullah-Gheechee people were traded in what was then Charlestowne, South Carolina. According to British historian P.E.H. Hair, Gullah culture developed as a creole culture in the colonies and United States from the peoples of many different African cultures who came together there. These included the Baga, Fula, Kissi, Kpelle, Limba, Mandinka, Mende, Susu, Temne, Vai, and Wolof of the Rice Coast, and many from Angola, Igbo, Calabar, West Congo, and the Gold Coast. By the middle of the 18th century, thousands of acres in the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry, and the Sea Islands were developed as African rice fields. African farmers from the \"Rice Coast\" brought the skills for cultivation and tidal irrigation that made rice farming one of the most successful industries in early America. The subtropical climate encouraged the spread of malaria and yellow fever, which were both carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. These tropical diseases were endemic in Africa and had been carried by enslaved Africans to the colonies. [20] Mosquitoes in the swamps and inundated rice fields of the Lowcountry picked up and spread the diseases to English and European settlers, as well. Malaria and yellow fever soon became endemic in the region. Because they had acquired some immunity in their homeland, Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import enslaved Africans. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority. [21] Coastal Georgia developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. [19] Others lived mostly in cities such as Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands. The planters left their European or African \"rice drivers\", or overseers, in charge of the rice plantations. [19] These had hundreds of laborers, with African traditions reinforced by new imports from the same regions. Over time, the Gullah people developed a creole culture in which elements of African languages, cultures, and community life were preserved to a high degree. Their culture developed in a distinct way, different from that of the enslaved African Americans in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland where the enslaved lived in smaller groups, and had more sustained and frequent interactions with whites and British American culture.

            "answer_text": "Africa has many a culture. More than 500 languages. More than 50 religions. 53 countries\u2026 etc. Most mainstream African Americans are closer to West Africans than the other Africans. In Uganda, a part of East Africa, where I stay, we have two main ethinicities; the Bantu who speak more than 20 languages and about 100 dailects in Uganda alone, and the Luo who also speak multiple languages and dailects. Although the cultures within the Bantu are very similar, there is a big difference between the cultures between the Luo and the Bantu. The more modern African culture, common among the youth and Urban areas, is majorly influenced by Hollywood and pop music, especially hip-hop and Jamaica's Dance Hall music. So I'd say African-American culture is more American than it is African but that's mostly because it's extremely hard to put a simplistic definition on what African culture is or should be in a general. On whether you have lost all traces of ancestral culture, I'd say that after colonization most of Africa decided to part with many a trace of ancestral African culture in favor of European, especially British culture. You're not alone. ",

If my children don\u2019t have a Jamaican culture then it\u2019s fair to say people who probably can\u2019t identify a known relative from Africa might have lost all the culture except for tiny bits. A culture is mostly based on where you live now with some tiny bits of history passed down to you by ancestors. I know a man who has Irish ancestry and every year at st Patrick\u2019s day he makes corned beef and cabbage. He does it because he knows of his ancestry and knows the food they eat. He has never ever seen his parents make that food. I myself is part Irish, small compared to my African heritage. I suspect most African Americans are influenced by their current geographical location instead of culture from their very far past. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe because people are expecting the wrong cultural connection. Here is a video of Blues played in Mali.  Take a listen, very closely. And then I want you to listen to this gentleman a blues pioneer named Junior Kimbrough  The blues are the roots of all Black American music genres. For years, people postulated that we created it out of pain and the suffering of slavery, as if it appeared out of thin air. It didn\u2019t. The ancestors brought it with them from Mali with the Mande slaves who were captured and sold. And then of course, we have the ring shout.  Take a really good look at the movement and the rhythm. Then take a look at these Fulani located in one of the regions raided for slaves who could cultivate African rice.  We can also see evidence of African culture lingering in the dance called the Charleston. This music is not the original, but the dance is;  If you look at the guy starting at 0:39, you\u2019ll see the exact same dance. Charleston was a rice state filled with malaria. They brought the Fulani there because they had innate immunity.  And what about that lovely dance that remains confined in the black church.  Look really closely at this tanz done by the Tuaregs of the Sahel  Last but not least, there is evidence of it in the funerals held in New Orleans.  The only place where you\u2019ll see something similar is in Senegal;  Although you can say that we have no culture of our own, because we arrived in 1619, our culture permeates and shapes American culture and has been exported to the world. However, never say that we don\u2019t have remnants of the culture, because we do. The problem is that people want to make comparisons with Nigerians, Kenyans and Ghanaians, when they should focus more on looking at cultures in the Senegambian, Mali area. 1 out of 3 enslaved people brought to the United States were Muslims, so when you start there, you will find similarities.

Despite the fact that indigenous Africans were also influenced by Europeans via colonialism. See- colonial map of Africa  Religion, economic systems, and political systems have changed in Africa via the colonialism processes. Most Africans today are either Christian or Muslim. It can be argued that individual values and beliefs shape motivations and behaviour. Some have debated whether religion is the deification of culture. See-https://www.africanamerica.org/topic/religion-the-deification-of-culture?nc=1 Nevertheless, there is a uniqueness about how Africans express and manifest European culture. Matriarchal traditions and religious idealism remain strong cultural expressions among Africans, whether on the continent or the diaspora. However, there has been enduring conflicts between the values of individualism and collectivism among Africans, with more assimilated Africans tending more towards individualism than those who retain authentic African culture.

            "answer_text": "Well there are thousands of African tribes. Maybe tens of thousands. So the slaves were gathered from all over Africa from inter tribal warfare. Before the big slave trade, they would have been just killed. This might be arguably better then what they went through. So even if you were capture on eastern Africa, you were worth something, but much less due to the risk of your death, escape, or worse, escape and killing your captors. Now once you were sold west enough that no one spoke your language, you were in more trouble. So when finally the survivors ended up in west africa they were already extremely mixed. Its possible no one in that group was of your tribe, as many would not have survived. Now I heard they actively prevented slaves who spoke the same language from being on the same plantation. Think of it, the slaves way out numbered them. Having no one that speaks your language is a safety factor for the owners. So the slaves didn\u2019t know where they came from in Africa, and the languages were lost. I\u2019ve talked to other immigrants that after 20 years in the US and not speaking much to others of their mother tongue, that they began to forget a lot of words. So any ability to save your culture is pretty much zeroed out. Though It is my hope that the new DNA tests can repair that. But they are a mix you say. Same thing with many Native Amerians. I was talking to a woman part Cheyene and part Apache. Many like to revive culture and say for example, learn the traditional dances. So she told me she was told to study both tribes a bit and then pick one. History gives us a feeling of place and belonging. I hope it is helpful. I have learned I\u2019m not finding my Irish anscestors anytime soon except for the immigrants themselves, my great grandparents. All birth certificates have the place of birth as just \u2018Ireland\u2019. Gee, so helpful. Then I realized it might be the official Irish records, but it was during the time that Britain \u2018owned\u2019 Ireland. They didn\u2019t take the effort to put down a real place of birth. So after my grandparents the only ones I\u2019m finding is through DNA. Yeah it makes a difference to me. I have Stonehenge people marker. That means that at least part of my family was potentially there for 7\u20138 THOUSAND years. And now those relationships are lost. ",
