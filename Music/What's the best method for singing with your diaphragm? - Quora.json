            "answer_text": "Hi Sarah, and thanks for the A2A. I\u2019m going to keep this simple. So in terms of physiology, the diaphragm is a muscle used for inhalation, so I\u2019m not sure the expression \u201csing with your diaphragm\u201d is literally accurate. Here\u2019s what I have been taught though. First, find and maintain good body alignment, especially being aware of kinks in the neck/head position that can add tension. The goal is for the larynx (voice box) to be relaxed. Second, inhale keeping the shoulders / upper body relaxed, and feel a nice expansion of the rib cage in the back. Now - and I believe this is the essence of the Italian \u201cappoggio\u201d technique - maintain the expanded rib cage and non-collapsed posture as you sing. Perhaps what is happening physiologically is that although the diaphragm is a muscle for inhalation, it stays active (via keeping the ribcage expanded) to provide a counterbalance against forces for exhalation so that there is an even steady breath pressure. Here is a good video where the baritone singer is given a towel as a prop to help energize and maintain the expanded rib cage while he sings, I think this may explain better than my words. The full \u201cclip\u201d starts here:  However, if you would like to jump ahead about 5 minutes, you can start here, with the kinetics consultant explaining the mechanics of posture and \u201cbreathing\u201d :  I think this is a really good and worthwhile video for just a few minutes of your time, so please take a look. Happy singing! ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. I had the same question a couple years back, so I took to the interwebs. Google led me to the article I linked below. Here\u2019s a quick paraphrase: This is the most important thing to recognize: don\u2019t try to use the air from your diaphragm\u2014instead, the goal is to use the space created by it.As a resonator, the voice uses a large space to resonate more loudly and comfortably, so learning the right, relaxed way to use the breath in singing\u2014and, to a lesser extent, speaking\u2014will have great effects on how comfortably and \u201cpowerfully\u201d you can sing.Here\u2019s a practical point: Take a quick breath in, but don\u2019t \u201chold\u201d the breath. Instead, \u201cmaintain\u201d the breath you should have the sensation as if you could keep inhaling, but that you aren\u2019t choosing to do so. (If the back of your throat is holding in pressure, then you\u2019re \u201cholding\u201d, not \u201cmaintaining\u201d.)Try to hold this feeling for a couple seconds. If you\u2019re doing it right, you should feel a nice burn a couple layers beneath your abs. Don\u2019t hold this too long\u2014it\u2019ll strengthen over time.Once you can comfortably maintain the breath for a good half-minute, then try singing a nice up-and-down melody while maintaining the breath. Don\u2019t force accuracy of notes\u2014just notice the relaxed feeling.(A note: If I recall correctly, this is called the method of apoggio in classical vocal training.)This link isn\u2019t my article, but it goes into more detail, and I have found that the principles and methods discussed help to increase understanding of how the voice uses the breath, as well as helping to improve this function.
