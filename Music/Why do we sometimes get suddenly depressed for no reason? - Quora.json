            "answer_text": "You have to realize that depression is the symptom, not the disease. The issue is usually a deficiency of a hormone or other neurotransmitters. In most cases, it was the lack of dopamine and serotonin. You can\u2019t control the amount and time for the release of these hormones but you can certainly boost their production in your body by keeping yourself happy as much as possible. But now the real question - The reason for feeling depressed for no reason?? Whenever a person is depressed, he/she may not know the reason for that situation but subconsciously there is something which is bothering him/her. It could be anything, maybe some old memoriesrecent fight with your closed onescareer goalsrelationship needsfinancial situationstraumatic incidents in the pasthidden or unknown envy feelings with someoneunknown inferiority complexetc, etc,.,.There may be a chance that you know it already but most of the time these issues affect you internally and your mind keep on pondering before taking any decisions related to them. You may not easily figure out whats going on in your head until the time you sit and retrospect. But even then it\u2019s a troublesome task to come out with a reason for this psychological activity. So tbh what I suggest you is to sit back in a calm environment, listen to some soothing instrumental music, keep a pen and paper in your hand and try to write whatever comes to your mind at that moment. No matter whatever you\u2019re writing, it could be about your favorite song, raged opinions, secret fantasies, past sins which you may relate to your current situations, future strategies to keep this feeling away or anything else, but you have to keep writing until you feel relaxed (it could be a paragraph or a humongous book) And KUDOS, you\u2019re feeling better than before. You\u2019re still feeling that you're in depression (ie. PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP), but believe me, my friend, if you do it occasionally whenever you feel low, I can assure you that you'll never face these frequent and unknown depressions again in your life :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently 19 years old. The first time I experienced my depression I was around the age of 9. So I\u2019ve lived with my depression for more than half my life. Depression is different for everyone and can be treated differently for many people too. But I thought I\u2019d share my experiences with it. My depression always had a reason even if I couldn\u2019t see it myself. The first time I had my depression was during the summer where I was about to start third grade. I had a friend I was really close to, but the thing is he was one year younger than me. And I was going to move to another section (because of third grade). And I basically remember that summer just me being sad and sitting at home doing nothing really. Which was so weird because my reaction was much bigger than it should\u2019ve been. But the thing is that the fear of losing a friend was only a part of my depression and I later discovered more that explained why I felt so bad. For those who are wondering our friendship didn\u2019t end after that summer we kept on meeting eachother after school and we sometimes had breaks together. However we lost contact completely later though. This sad thing during the summer kept recurring for years, and sometimes it didn\u2019t even have a reason to (or atleast that\u2019s what I thought back then). And when I was in eight grade I started getting bad grades, my depression started coming more often and not only during summer, I also had been stuck in a game addiction for years which was a part of the problem. My response to all this was to focus on school, friends and kept playing games to avoid it. And eventually it got really bad when I started High school. I had to start seeing a psychologist who helped me get through it. Back then I had no idea how advanced my depression was. Even tough I am now \u201cDeclared free\u201d from my depression it will still always be a part of me, but now I atleast understand it, and can deal with it so it doesn\u2019t affect my everyday life. I would love to write about it all, explain the different parts of my depression. But I fear that will be way too long to even write or read. But I will however summarize and give you tips which helped me alot during my journey. To keep it short my depression was a mixture between fear of change, bad childhood (which also built up an inner anger, which was destructive to me), a lot of avoided feelings, emotional personality, being surrounded by the wrong type of people and not accepting myself. There is also more that could be added but these were the most important in my opinion. My tips to you Write down what you\u2019re feeling and/or what\u2019s happening during your days. I used to write alot when I was depressed and it helped me dig deeper and find what made me feel bad.Eat healthy and exercise. I hated when people told me this. And a part of me don\u2019t like to tell others this either because of how I felt when people told me this. But it helped me, even though it wasn\u2019t the main reason I got better. Some people feel bad because they eat unhealthy or live a bad lifestyle. For me personally eating more healthy makes me less tired so I can focus better and exercising can make me more happy overall (not always though)Get to know yourself better (if you don\u2019t already). Taking different personality tests made me understand myself better. My strenghts and weaknesses so I could work on them to become happier but also to accept myself. However don\u2019t take everything on tests literally, cause they can be wrong too sometimes and don\u2019t put a big stamp on your head just because a test says so.Reflect over the people around you. If you have negative friends around you you\u2019ll also get more negative. You want friends who lift the best in you, support you and make you feel good. This is however much easier said than done. I still have some bad friends. But I have better friends now!Try to do things that make you happy. When I was in the middle of my depression I had very few things that made me happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should stop doing them. Even if you don\u2019t appreciate doing them now you might appreciate it afterwards, and it will also makes you less isolated which is my next tip.Keep your friends close. Since I found almost everything except playing video games boring. I isolated myself a lot. Don\u2019t do that. It\u2019ll only make it worse! Keep hanging out with your friends and keep doing things with them. However alone time is also good to have sometimes to let you feel and work on your inner.Stay strong! I hope you\u2019ll feel better soon! ",
