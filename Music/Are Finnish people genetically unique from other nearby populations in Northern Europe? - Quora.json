            "answer_text": "Commercial DNA sites such as 23andMe can readily identify specifically Finnish DNA from that of other localities. Finns are genetically distinct from their neighbouring populations and form outliers in the genetic variation within Europe. Within Finland itself, researchers can find a divide - which interestingly also follows the N\u00f6teburg-Line (a political treaty of 1323 formalising the border between the then Novogord and Swedish empires. This also appears to be a cultural border. To the East of this line more modern mtDNA haplogroup types tended to the Farmer-associated H, J, K, T and V, whereas to the West the mtDNA haplotype swings towards Hunter Gatherer-associated haplotypes (contrarily to the ancient DNA findings). Likewise, the male Y-haplotype tend to \u2018Nc1\u2019 in the east and \u2018I\u2019 in the west. In addition, it was found Saami populations differed genetically from the Finns. Haplogroup I is also common in eastern Sweden and less so further west and south of it. The means of research was to identify 103 individuals in ancient graves from various ages from 1,500 years BCE, the Iron Age 500BC to AD1300, Medieval Age, etc., across Finland, and compare the findings to modern day Finns. One of these sites, at Lev\u00e4nluhta (near modern day Vaasa, on the West coast) contains surprising Saami-like DNA of U5b1b1a - surprising because it was further south than expected - leading researchers to believe the Saami once lived much further south than today. This DNA is shown in modern-day Saami populations as its continuation. Linguistically, too, some Finnish place names appear to have a Saami-language origin. For example, in South-West Finland, barely fifteen kilometres from the coast, and which was once very near the coast several thousand years ago, is a hill named Piksm\u00e4ki, a clear Saami construction, to the minds of linguistic experts. The Finnish construction would be Pitk\u00e4m\u00e4ki (=Tall Hill). So then, in the east, we see a more modern Farmer-type trend in mtDNA and in the west - where farming is fertile and well established since at least AD100 and extensive by the 1200\u2019s we have the paradox of West Finland being predominantly mtDNA U5a today, up to 58% of the population, a hunter-gather type. Compared to neighbouring countries, this concordant with Denmark ancient DNA (20% U5a). Throughout the rest of Europe, this is U5a haplotype is rare at only 1.5% of the population and just 6% throughout modern day Finland. The mtDNA haplotypes that dominate Europe today are of the farmer-type, see above, which came to Europe via Anatola circa 9,000 years ago. U5 mtDNA is associated with far northern regions and is as old as 39K years although due to the Ice Age the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), circa 21.5K years ago, these hunter-gatherers retreated southwards and were the first to venture back into Europe, probably in search of food, such as the red deer and woolly mammoth they were known to have stalked. The paucity of Farmer mtDNA in modern day Saami populations illustrates how the Hunter-Gatherer mtDNA has persisted even to today with little mixing with other populations. One would have thought there would be a close connection with the mtDNA U4 and and U6, which is prevalent across the way in Latvia and Estonia but this is not so. Researchers believe this is because the Gulf of Finland sea acted as a barrier to migration and mixing. Thus neighbouring Estonia and Latvia, across the Gulf, do not share similar mtDNA, other than being of the hunter-gather type U. The neighbouring countries With respect to Finland\u2019s neighbours to the west and east, commercial DNA companies such as 23andMe do not appear to show \u2018Swedish\u2019, \u2018Norwegian\u2019 or \u2018Russian\u2019 mtDNA as specifically identifiable other than as \u2018Scandinavian\u2019 or \u2018Eastern European\u2019 (Slavic). The predominant DNA of these countries - at last in the European part of Russia - would be broadly of the Farmer-type with the Hunter-Gatherer U haplotype in their more northerly populations. The Comparison Sites of Ancient Finnish Remains  From: Nature (Open Access Sharing) From the research paper: The ancient mitochondrial genomes analyzed here show a notable pattern opposite to the modern variation: mtDNA types usually associated with the hunter-gatherer communities were significantly more common in the ancient western cluster (Lev\u00e4nluhta, Luistari and Hollola) than in the east (Hiitola, Tuukkala), with the haplogroup U frequency as high as 58.3%. In contrast, the farming-related lineages were observed in particular in the ancient eastern cluster. This pattern of division between the ancient sites, and the contradictions with their respective local modern population frequencies emerged also in formal testing of pairwise \u03a6ST values: the western cluster was closer to the modern NE subpopulation than to the modern SW subpopulation whereas the eastern cluster showed closer affinity with the modern mtDNA variation in southwestern Finland. Where have the Populations Migrated from?  Source: New Scientist The \u2018farmers\u2019 came from the Middle East, via African origins, and the \u2018hunter-gatherers\u2019 from the east or south via Africa, Asia and via Siberia. It is thought the hunter-gatherers (Neolithic) populated Europe just after the LGM over the last 8,000 - 18,000 years ago or so. There is a theory that due to the Ice Age being especially focussed around the Scandinavian mountains with ice sheets up to 3,000 metres thick, that there may have been some ancient populations still living to the north of this, which was not so affected, in isolation for up to 100,000 years and who never actually left. An interesting theory. Summary The genetic make up of Eastern Finns differs from Western Finns, and again, the Saamis differ from both. Finnish DNA is specifically different from other Europeans. It can be distinguished from the Baltic countries to the south, such as Estonia and Latvia, with the Gulf of Finland sea forming a natural barrier to intermixing. Finnish DNA differs from the Swedes in the west and the Russians in the east. However, it has more similarities in general with these countries more northerly populations, which have retained the ancient U5 mtDNA and U haplotypes in general. ",
