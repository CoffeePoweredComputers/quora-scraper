            "answer_text": "I love how people always treat the fretless bass with a sideways glance. Disclaimer: Most every bass guitar player will gravitate towards fretted. The entry price is less, and there is a lot of versatility and tonal variation in using the frets on the soundboard as \u201chammers\u201d to amplify sounds and provide percussive beats. It\u2019s also just easier to play. You will constantly hear people talk about how a fretless bass is so hard to play, that you need to constantly be listening for tuning, and even that it is \u201coutdated\u201d or for \u201cshowoffs\u201d. There is really only one reason that these stereotypes occur: because everyone plays their fretless like a fretted bass.  I\u2019m just guessing here, but I don\u2019t think Bootsy Collins plays fretless. Look at the millions of children every year who learn violin, or cello, or trombone, or any other instrument that require accurate playing for accurate note production. Fretless bass simply takes practice. I assure you that if you play fretless only, and never take up a fretted bass, you will develop a unique sound. I assure you that if you take up fretted bass, and then pick up a fretless bass, years later, as I did, you will be humbled, and intimidated. But, if you, say, dedicate 6 months and say you will only play fretless, no matter what song you are playing, you will get SO much better and so much more attuned to your instrument, that you will understand. Then go back to you slappin\u2019 poppin\u2019 bass. After a week of \u201coh hell ya!\u201d as you rediscover your first love, you will look longingly at the fretless. You have grown. Fretted basses are my love, my passion, and my solace in sound. I never stop learning.  Nothing but fingers and a board. Scary. Fretless basses are my challenge, my drill sergeant, my mind-opening escape into the world of melodic support and counterpoint. In other words, they are merciless and rewarding at the same time. With a fretted bass I\u2019m a bass player. With a fretless bass, I\u2019m a musician. If I was starting all over again, I would never consider any other bass besides a fretless. ",

            "answer_text": "A fretted bass is the best way to go for beginners, or most bassists really. You\u2019ll have an easier time learning where all the notes are, and there will be less of a hassle to locate patterns(octaves, for example). All the notes are separated by frets, so there will be no slight variations of pitch. There\u2019s less room for adventurous playing with a fretted bass. To be frank, the disadvantage is essentially negligible for most bassists. Hitting the frets instead of the space in between produces an awful sound. The \u201cbuzz\u201d makes for a good deterrent against fucking up, though. One of the biggest hurdles with learning how to play the fretless bass is memorizing the exact locations of notes so you don\u2019t royally fuck up. With a fretted bass, you can avoid that. Tuning sucks, tuning with a fretless bass sucks even more. Fretless basses allow for more expression than fretted basses. This is perhaps, the main selling point. Fretless basses work well for players who aspire to emulate Victor Wooten\u2019s style. If you want to sound like Flea, stick with fretted basses. If you want to be a showoff, go with the fretless bass. It\u2019s important to note that merely owning a fretless bass will not magically provide you with Jaco\u2019s godly bass expertise. ",
