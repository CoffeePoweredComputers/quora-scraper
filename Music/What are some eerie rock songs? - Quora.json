            "answer_text": "I think the song \u201cRhythm of the Heat\u201d by Peter Gabriel can be eerie, especially if you know the inspiration for the song. Gabriel was inspired to write this song after reading \u201cSymbols And The Interpretation of Dreams\u201d by Carl Jung. Jung was writing about the collective unconscious and describes being embedded with tribal drummers and dancers in Africa. Jung was so entranced by the music and movement he began to fear that he was losing his mind. Gabriel perfectly captures his fear and paranoia especially at the end of the song when he employs strong tribal drumbeats and a Ghanaian war dance with these ominous heavy thuds. I watched a video of Gabriel and his band performing this song at the first WOMAD show (see video at end of this answer). When the drums kick in he has these amazing African drummers and dancers join him on stage. He starts to get entranced, falls to his knees and begins to writhe, eyes rolling to the back of his head, as he slowly leans back and becomes possessed with this maelstrom of sound and emotion. Wow!! What a breath taking performance! Here are the lyrics and song. I hope you enjoy! Lyrics: Looking out the window I see the red dust clear high up on the red rock Stands the shadow with the spear The land here is strong, strong beneath my feet it feeds on the blood, it feeds on the heat The rhythm is below me the rhythm of the heat the rhythm is around me the rhythm has control the rhythm is inside me the rhythm has my soul (the rhythm of the heat) x6 Repeat x2 Drawn across the plain land to the place that is higher Drawn into the circle that dances round the fire We spit into our hands and breathe across the palms Raising them up high, held open to the sun Self conscious, uncertain I'm showered with the dust The spirit enters into me and I submit to trust Smash the radio (no outside voices here) Smash the watch (cannot tear the day to shreds) Smash the camera (cannot steal away the spirits) The rhythm is around me The rhythm\u2019s in control The rhythm is inside me The rhythm has my soul Peter Gabriel The Rhythm Of The Heat Security And at WOMAD 1982 PETER GABRIEL - Womad Festival - Shepton Mallet ( Bath) july 16, 1982 ",

The Rolling Stones Lyrics Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst The air smells sweet, the air smells sick He never smiles, his mouth merely twists The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick But I know his name, he's called Mr. D. And one of these days he's gonna set you free Human skulls is hangin' right 'round his neck The palms of my hands is clammy and wet Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. Will it be poison put in my glass Will it be slow or will it be fast? The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night Hiding in a corner in New York City Lookin' down a forty-four in West Virginia I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. One night I was dancin' with a lady in black Wearin' black silk gloves and a black silk hat She looked at me longin' with black velvet eyes She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones The eyes in her skull was burning like coals Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone I was dancin' with Mrs. D. Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free Dancin', dancin' ",
