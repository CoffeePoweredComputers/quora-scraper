            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to make a top 10 list but rather show you some movies that I perceive as best of the best. All of them are a solid 10/10 to me. The list is subject to change and is not exclusive. The Green Mile (1999)  A great, very moving film that touches the deepest strings of your soul that teaches not to judge a person from what one looks like. Even if it\u2019s a possible killer. The Last Samurai (2003)  An alcoholic and a civil war officer with a mental trauma was offered to train japanese recruits in discipline and shooting. At some point, he was captured by the hostile samurai forces. He learns dignity and wishes himself a honorable death. With time, eventually the captors became his friends and ex-allies his mortal enemies. Forrest Gump (1994)  The movie that is filled with love and kind of\u2026simplicity. Because of the protagonist having down syndrome, all of the stories told by him have this special feeling to them (no pun intended). It\u2019s like a kid telling you a fascinating story about how he\u2019s been to vietnam, saved other people, ran for a year and finally, became a successful businessman by catching shrimp and investing into some strange company called \u201cApple\u201d. Intouchables (2011)  Definitely one of the best comedies I\u2019ve seen in many years. Filled with many extravagant and original jokes, it is a story of how a poor, uneducated and ill-mannered person becomes a caregiver of a handicapped millionaire. Throughout the movie, they make a very important exchange that changes their lives: the poor one constantly makes the other one laugh and finally shows him how to enjoy life. The rich one teaches manners, respect and many other aspects of life. WALL\u00b7E (2008)  In the future, humans can no longer live on their home planet because of waste, so they constructed ships to fly into space and cruise there. The only beings left on Earth are the waste-collecting robot WALL\u00b7E and his pet roach. Robot\u2019s simple life makes a turn and now he\u2019s the one to decide the fate of mankind. It\u2019s not only a movie about a cute robot but a warning: if we continue to behave so thoughtlessly about waste and become even more lazier than we already are - our planet will definitely look like the one in \u201cWALL\u00b7E\u201d. Heat (1995)  A movie with basically 2 main characters: Rob De Niro as the robber and Al Pachino as the detective. Because of that it\u2019s got some phenomenal acting. A great and long story about how the life of crime never really ends well. What is more important - once you\u2019re in, it\u2019s close to impossible to get out. Going to mention one more thing though - the bank robbery scene that was filmed using real weaponry and real gunshots\u2026damn, it\u2019s certainly the best shootout I\u2019ve seen on film. The Hateful Eight (2015)  I simply love and adore Tarantino and most of his movies. This movie is not about loving a particular director but the way actors play, the way the talk, the accents they imitate. Everything is nearly perfect in the shot: lighting, outfits, sound. It\u2019s like watching a stage show but you\u2019re either sitting in front of the scene or you\u2019re actually the one playing\u2026 ",
