            "answer_text": "Some people go to auditions to enter a company or they are street-casted by the company themselves to become a trainee. Being a trainee is very difficult. They have to go for vocal/dance/rap lessons every day and some also produce music. If trainees attend school, they have to go to the company straight after school to start practicing. Some have trained for less then a year to up to 10 years to finally debut as idols. Then the conpany does some evaluations to decide the final lineup of a group. If a trainee does not pass the evaluation, they will be cut. They are evaluated on their improvement and their stage presence as Korea tends to focus more on visuals than talent. Some companies even measure the trainees\u2019 weight and if they are heavier than the standard weight that the company has set, they will also be cut out. When the final lineup of a group is decided, they will prepare for their debut- recording songs, making chreography, filming their music video, etc. However, even after this stage, the trainees are not safe from being cut yet as the company may just decide that they want a smaller group or the trainee is slowing the debut. Then finally, debut. One or two weeks before the official debut, the members will be revealed to the public or they might do pre-debut activities. Some groups are formed through survival shows, such as the produce series. The road to debuting is very difficult though. Many have quit as they have lost their dream of being an idol over time while some just can\u2019t cope with the stress of being a trainee. I have no experience being a trainee, I\u2019m just writing this based on some shows I\u2019ve watched. I recommend watching Idol Drama Operation Team as they ( girl group members) discussed about the hardships of being a trainee and the road to debut. I hope this helps! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Idols are casted in streets to go to an audition or the companies themselves make auditions to cast people to be singers, actors, MCs or whatever. The agency then trains the ones who want to become idols (trainees); they train their vocals, they train their dancing, and their behaviour, because they have to be really polite, nice, kind\u2026 When the agency decides to debut a new group (normally girl groups or boy groups), they get a number of people to form the group (this number can vary, the largest group in Korea I know is NCT, which at the moment has 18 members, but there's a girl group in Japan that has 48 members). The group, now formed, trains together till their debut day. From the day they debuted to the day they actually debut, even two years may pass. Then the group debut, normally with a song the agency has written and produced. The bad thing of this is that k-pop groups don't get paid till they pay their loan to the agency. This is because they agency pays the training of the ones debuting and they have to get the money back, and till the groups paid that loan, two years may pass as well, that doesn't mean the agency takes all their money, they probably get a percentage of the money the trainees -now idols- gain. I hope it's clear and sorry it's too long, this is something that can't be explained in two lines. ",
