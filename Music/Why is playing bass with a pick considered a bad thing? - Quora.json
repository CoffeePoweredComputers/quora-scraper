            "answer_text": "Playing bass guitar with a pick is not necessarily a bad thing, however, for a beginner it hinders your ability to stay in the rhythm properly. In this manner it is more a psychological limitation than a physical limitation; the pick allows you to play many notes at a great speed, which reduces the pressure to stay in rhythm. When playing the bass it is better to have an excellent sense of rhythm than the ability to play many notes without rhythm. You have to remember that the bass is a grounding instrument; it constitutes the lower range of pitches that establish both the overall rhythm and the doninant tone (usually by playing the root note of a chord or some other note to provide counterpoint, such as the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, or 13th). For advanced bassists, the main reason for avoiding the pick is not for the lack of a sense of rhythm, but because playing finger style (with either the index finger or both the index and middle fingers) allows you to utilize the rest stroke, a technique which involves \u201cpushing through\u201d one string and landing on the one below it or above it. This elicits a pleasant thumping noise associated with the bass, both classical and modern. Both the double (upright) bass and the bass guitar are characterized by their thumping noise, which is garnered by using a technique hindered by the pick, hence the rejection of the pick. HOWEVER: This is not supposed to be some exhortation against the plectrum; instead, I am merely attempting to illustrate certain reasons some bass players choose not to use a pick. It is entirely up to you whether you wish to use a pick. Anyway, I hope this helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not, lots of guys do that. Most don\u2019t because why would you settle for one guitar pick when you could have two, three or four. There is also a tone advantage to using your fingers. I can change the attack on the fly by just switching from my pads to my fingernails and I use round or rough wraps so the difference is very pronounced. I also learned on a stand up\u2026 no pick is going to work on that so you just learn to pluck with your fingers (the sides actually). When I changed to electric bass the only thing I changed was that I moved from the side of my fingers to the pads. It was quite natural to do. Lastly the bass has a very long neck compared to a guitar. By the time you get the axe sitting high enough to be comfortable using a pick correctly you have moved the neck to where you can no longer hold it correctly and loose reach. (your wrist should be straight, your thumb in the middle back of the neck). I do know several pick bassists, some of them are even pretty fast. Bass however is generally way more about the knowledge than the speed. If you are good at it and know what your doing, no one cares how you pluck. ",
