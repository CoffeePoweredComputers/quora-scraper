            "answer_text": "Ariana actually got her first number one not so long ago, as soon as late November, as over the course of her past 4 albums her highest peak was with \u2018Problem\u2019 (2014) at #2. However with the release of her latest singles \u2018thank u, next\u2019 which is a beautiful breakup song that Ariana mentions in all of her ex-boyfriends; including the late mac miller, this song was Ariana\u2019s first number one followed by her 2019 Mega-Hit \u201c7 Rings\u201d that debuted as well on #1. I see the hate in your question, but the simple answer would be that her songs are getting more recognized and loved in the general public than before. That still DOES NOT mean that these songs are her BEST songs, personally I find that \u2018God is a woman\u2019 and \u2018Into You\u2019 were one of her best songs yet! ",
