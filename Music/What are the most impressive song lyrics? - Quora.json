            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve used this song before for this type of thing. Just think about the division and hatred in this country today. People don\u2019t trust the police or the government, and the political parties seem to hate each other. We are still having terrible wars. Now jump back in time to 1969. Viet Nam was in full swing, people were losing faith in their elected leaders. In my opinion, the one song that literally nails the mood of the country then AND now, is Monster by Steppenwolf. If you decide to listen, the best version is the one below. The music is great and it\u2019s even better when you know the lyrics. Here are the words\u2026 Once the religious, the hunted and weary Chasing the promise of freedom and hope Came to this country to build a new vision Far from the reaches of kingdom and pope Like good Christians, some would burn the witches Later some got slaves to gather riches But still from near and far to seek America They came by thousands to court the wild And she just patiently smiled and bore a child To be their spirit and guiding light And once the ties with the crown had been broken Westward in saddle and wagon it went And 'til the railroad linked ocean to ocean Many the lives which had come to an end While we bullied, stole and bought our a homeland We began the slaughter of the red man But still from near and far to seek America They came by thousands to court the wild And she just patiently smiled and bore a child To be their spirit and guiding light The blue and grey they stomped it They kicked it just like a dog And when the war over They stuffed it just like a hog And though the past has it's share of injustice Kind was the spirit in many a way But it's protectors and friends have been sleeping Now it's a monster and will not obey The spirit was freedom and justice And it's keepers seem generous and kind It's leaders were supposed to serve the country But now they won't pay it no mind 'Cause the people grew fat and got lazy And now their vote is a meaningless joke They babble about law and order But it's all just an echo of what they've been told Yeah, there's a monster on the loose It's got our heads into a noose And it just sits there watchin' Our cities have turned into jungles And corruption is stranglin' the land The police force is watching the people And the people just can't understand We don't know how to mind our own business 'Cause the whole worlds got to be just like us Now we are fighting a war over there No matter who's the winner We can't pay the cost 'Cause there's a monster on the loose It's got our heads into a noose And it just sits there watching America where are you now? Don't you care about your sons and daughters? Don't you know we need you now We can't fight alone against the monste America where are you now? Don't you care about your sons and daughters? Don't you know we need you now We can't fight alone against the monste America  ",

I\u2019ll give myself 5 minutes and write the ones that come to my head: From Pearl Jam, \"Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town\": I seem to recognize your facehaunting, familiar, yet I can't seem to place it.Cannot find the candle of thought to light your namelifetimes are catching up with me\u2026\u201d *** Pearl Jam, Black: \u201cI know someday you'll have a beautiful life,I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky,But why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?\u201d *** Pink Floyd, \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d: \u201cThere is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown, The dream is gone. I have become comfortably numb.\u201d *** Don Henley, \u201cBoys of Summer\u201d: \u201cOut on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a CadillacA little voice inside my head said, \"Don't look back. You can never look back\"I thought I knew what love wasWhat did I know?Those days are gone foreverI should just let them go but-\u201d *** Michael Boggs, \u201cWhat Would Jesus Undo\u201d: \u201cWould God un-preach every sermon spoke in hatredThe kind with hell fire burning on their lipsWould He un-sing every sacred song of worshipWhen we sing but don\u2019t mean a word of it Would He un-say every scripture said in angerThe kind that\u2019s used to hurt more than to helpWould He un-point all the pointed words and fingersHold up a mirror so we can point \u2018em at ourselves\u201d *** Drivin\u2019 and Cryin\u2019, \u201cI\u2019m Going Straight to Hell\u201d: The black widow and the ladies man, met down at the laundromatAnd tried to make me understandThe neighbors were all in a stir, about what they might have heardRunnin' down they shouted out, it seemed Next door a girl she lives about the same age as meAnd asked me to come upstairs for a seeJust then her mother burst in, said, \"You're the son of thatBitch in the wind, get out of my house and hit the road\"And I kept fallin' like a Rolling Stones song 'Cause I'm going straight to hell, just like my mama said'Cause I'm going straight to hell'Cause I'm going straight to hell, just like my mama said'Cause I'm going straight to hell Boxer Rebellion, \u201cDiamonds\u201d: \u201cPretty little thing did you feel somethingDid you always want me to be somethingTo mend a broken a heartFrom a Devil of shallow nonsenseTurned your world upside down Whatever said that it'd mean somethingWhatever said that it'd mean nothingAnd did I look the partWhen it's all said and doneWhen it's all said and done I'm no good next to DiamondsWhen I'm too close to start to fadeAre you angry with me nowAre you angry cause I'm to blame\u201d *** Simon and Garfunkel, \u201cSounds of silence\u201d: Hello darkness, my old friendI've come to talk with you againBecause a vision softly creepingLeft its seeds while I was sleepingAnd the vision that was planted in my brainStill remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked aloneNarrow streets of cobblestone'Neath the halo of a street lampI turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbedBy the flash of a neon lightThat split the nightAnd touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I sawTen thousand people, maybe morePeople talking without speakingPeople hearing without listening People writing songsThat voices never shareAnd no one dareDisturb the sound of silence \"Fools, \" said I, \"you do not knowSilence like a cancer growsHear my words that I might teach youTake my arms that I might reach you.\"But my words like silent raindrops fellAnd echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayedTo the neon God they madeAnd the sign flashed out its warningAnd the words that it was forming And the sign said,\"The words of the prophetsAre written on the subway wallsAnd tenement halls.\"And whispered in the sound of silence Full stop, cause I could be here all week!
