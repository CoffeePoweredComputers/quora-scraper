            "answer_text": "Pick up to plug or within the amp? If you have schematic for it you can signal trace the path as it goes thru the circuit. An o scope helps. If not, you can check the tubes or transistor for proper voltage and ground. Is the signal degraded or just not amplified. When I was in the army fixing artillery radars we had test points that we would go to first. Got signal, great on to the next. If the signal never made it to the next one or was not amplified or screwed up that narrow it down. Time to be analytical. If say signals good to a transistor but not good out of it, do you have proper voltage? Ground? Is it an open, a short. Generally, I'd signal then voltage check. Then power it off and check resistance systematically. Capacitor to resistor, resistor to transistor. Then each path way of transistor. All good? Now check the transistor itself. Pnp ,npn think of it as checking two diodes stuck together. You're going to have to flip the multimeter leads both ways for emmiter to base and collector to base and then emmiter to collector to check if it had shorted. Sometimes you can visually see problem, resistor is scorched black and broke in two carbonized halves. But replacing that may not be a complete job, what caused that to burn? A capacitor on its last legs, a short ,check everything around the bad part. Good luck with it. ",
