            "answer_text": "Although it requires some setup, using a midi controller keyboard and software is going to you considerably more realistic piano sounds, along with so much flexibility. In terms of midi controller keyboards, there are 88 key versions with weighted keys, or you could pick up a cheap stage piano (e.g. a Yamahe P45, around \u00a3400) which has some basic piano sounds built in (for when you want to just switch on and go), but also midi. Sound wise, my choice since 2006 has been the Reason Pianos plugin that works with Reason. It has a Steinway D Grand Piano (along with a Yamaha grand and upright) with multiple choices of mics to tailor the sound. It\u2019s a piano sound that\u2019s so natural and easy to get lost in. There are other options, such as Native Instruments\u2019 \u201cAlicia Keys\u201d and physically-modelled pianos from PianoTech (there\u2019s a free demo on their site if you want to try it out). The fact is hardware keyboards haven\u2019t really progressed very far in 20 years and don\u2019t have the memory or processing power for highly detailed pianos - I try to like them, but once you\u2019ve played software pianos it\u2019s hard to find them anymore than passable - the detail simply isn\u2019t there. Going the software route, you can buy everything you need (midi controller, decently powered laptop, audio interface and software) and still have plenty of change left over. Hope this helps, Rob ",

            "answer_text": "Nord has great hype, and it\u2019s top-quality equipment with a stunning appearance and great sound. If you want something comparable in feel and sound, your best bet is probably to find a weighted-MIDI controller and pair it with Apple\u2019s Mainstage or Ableton Live. ",
