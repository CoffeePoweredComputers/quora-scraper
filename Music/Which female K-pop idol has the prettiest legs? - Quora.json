            "answer_text": "One thing I can tell you is that men and women have a slightly different opinion on what makes a female leg attractive. I have noticed that most women think that very long and thin legs look the best. On the other hand I have noticed that most men including myself tend to prefer legs that are not too thin and instead have a nice shape to them, and some might even prefer legs that are rather curvy and full or that have some definition and muscle. It is true that longer is usually preferred to shorter, but again the more important feature is the shape and the curve that the leg makes more than its length. I think Hani from EXID is a good (and rather famous) example. Her legs are nicely curved but still long and slim.  ",

As u can see her legs are stunning and really thin, since she is underweight, no wonder her legs seems longer and she's pretty tall too.  I really like her legs, like they look so long and her legs are my legs goals. I don't have a clear photo of Jennie, but her legs look healthier than the rest of member and seems strong too. I just want to have her legs and her whole body is a body goals!!  ",
