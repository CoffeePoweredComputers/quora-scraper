            "answer_text": "As you\u2019ve implied, pronouns in Japanese are gendered and yes, \u201cboku\u201d is a pronoun primarily used by young males. There are a few possible explanations, the first of which is most likely: The \u201cI\u201d that\u2019s referenced in the song, is not the female singer, but a different male. If you take a step back and think about English for a second, a sizable percentage of the 10s of thousands of English-language songs that contain the word \u201cI\u201d are not referencing the singer themselves. They might be speaking from a specific person\u2019s voice or a generalized person\u2019s voice. To take a random example, Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cLivin\u2019 On A Prayer\u201d: Whoa, we're half way thereWhoa, livin' on a prayerTake my hand and we'll make it - I swearWhoa, livin' on a prayer Notice the \u201cI swear\u201d line. The \u201cI\u201d in question here is either Tommy (\u201cwho used to work on the docks\u201d) or Gina (\u201cwho works the diner all day\u201d) \u2014 neither of whom are Jon Bon Jovi himself.* Because Jon Bon Jovi is considered male, we imbue the \u201cI\u201d with maleness. If the song were covered by a female, the \u201cI\u201d would be imbued with femaleness. Needless to say, the pronoun doesn\u2019t change because in English we don\u2019t have gendered pronouns. In Japanese, on the other hand, the singer would get to choose. Does he/she want the \u201cI\u201d to be the voice of Tommy (male - Boku, Ore, etc), Gina (female - Atashi, etc) or gender neutral (Watashi, etc). This has nothing to do with the gender of the singer. In this scenario, their choice of \u201cI\u201d isn\u2019t intended to be gender-bending, it is very literal. The \u201cI\u201d is male \u2014 therefore they use Boku. An offshoot example on the same theme is where the \u201cI\u201d is used in quotation. An example from Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cVisions Of Johanna\u201d: When the jelly-faced women all sneezeHear the one with the mustache say, \"JeezeI can't find my knees.\" In translation, Bob Dylan or any male singer, would naturally use a feminine pronoun or a gender-neutral one where femininity is implied. And rightly so, the \u201cI\u201d isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s the woman with the mustache! The second possibility is that the \u201cI\u201d that\u2019s referenced in the song, is intentionally masculine (or just being playful), even though it\u2019s a female singer. She, for whatever reason, wants to reference herself in a masculine way. Imagine a strong female singing the song \u201cI\u2019ve Been Working On The Railroad\u201d. She might gender it male as a show of strength. The third possibility is that the original song was \u201cboku\u201d and she just kept it that way. It could be just to preserve the original way, or for structural reasons. For example, \u201cBoku\u201d is two-syllables, \u201cOre\u201d (another male pronoun) is also two-syllables, while \u201cAtashi\u201d and \u201cWatashi\u201d (female and neutral respectively) are three syllables. That can make swapping out a male with a female pronoun quite tricky.** It shouldn\u2019t make you uncomfortable, though. As you get more exposure to Japanese language and culture, you\u2019ll run into many examples of males (even tough and angry males) using what sounds like, or is feminine language. You\u2019ll also begin to realize that there are many cultural examples of male and female gender-swapping (example: Kabuki is commonly all male, even the female roles, and Takarazuka is all-female, even the male roles). Best of luck with your Japanese studies and keep asking questions as you learn! *I\u2019m aware that there is yet another interpretation of the song where Jon Bon Jovi is telling the story of Tommy and Gina to a yet unnamed person and the \u201cI\u201d in question is himself. **I guess they could go with the Hiroshima-style, two-syllabled, \u201cWashi\u201d pronoun if the song allowed for it :-) ",

Its lyric uses a boy & girl dialogue, therefore it naturally has the first person singular pronoun for boy and girl. The song was commercially successful so much that I guess many songs tried to follow. ",
