            "answer_text": "Now here\u2019s a tough one. Two classics. Eagles vs Skynyrd. I\u2019ll give you what I like about both(really what is there to dislike???) Hotel California- where to begin? The trancelike state the guitars in this song put me in? Don Henley\u2019s very near perfect voice to my ears? The wonderfully surreal lyricism? This whole song is very near perfect to me. Those dueling guitar solos at the end, beautiful. Needless to say I\u2019m a huge Eagles fan. Free Bird- let me preface this one by saying I grew up on Lynyrd Skynyrd. I sat in my room for hours as a kid learning as many of their songs as I could, especially the solo to free bird. It\u2019s a handful to say the least. I believe it was Allen Collins who played both guitars you hear in that epic finale. Dueling with himself through the power of overdubs. The music is really very pretty in the intro and lets face it: the lyrics are timeless. In conclusion, I can\u2019t decide! I\u2019m tempted to go with hotel California simply for Henley\u2019s voice and my love of surreal lyrics and atmosphere in songs. But Free Bird is just a blast. I\u2019ve played it with my band for years and I have the time of my life every time. Nothing like playing that guitar solo for an audience. I think Hotel California might have a little more thought into the lyrics, arrangement, chord structure etc so on that level it could maybe be considered the better song. But I can\u2019t pick one or the other! ",

            "answer_text": "The one you enjoy listening to the most. The one that brings back awesome memories. To me, Hotel California reminds me of my early college years. I would listen to it on the bus. I would learn it on the guitar and enjoy singing it. It has a distinct feeling of nostalgia, with a tinge of bittersweet. Freebird reminds me of an ex-girlfriend who loved Lynyrd Skynyrd, with whom I would be in her car, driving on long empty roads, listening to music and having a good time in each other's company. How could I choose between both? ",
