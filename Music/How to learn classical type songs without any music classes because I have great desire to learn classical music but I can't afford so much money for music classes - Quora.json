            "answer_text": "Dear Aastha: I wish I could help but you have asked a very difficult question. All over the world, instrumental musicians spend a lifetime mastering the art of performance practice and, when they have completed their formal musical training, they try to find professional work. I\u2019m an American and have lived in seven foreign countries and one thing that I\u2019ve noticed is that, after all their training, musicians understandably expect to be paid for their services - that\u2019s how they feed themselves and their family members. When you express an interest in studying classical music, do you want to learn to actually play an instrument or do you simply wish to learn about western music history. I may be wrong but, either way, it\u2019ll cost money. If you wish to simply learn about classical music history, then I recommend you purchase a used copy (for a tremendous discount, particularly for a paperback version) of Roger Kamien\u2019s Music: An Appreciation. Any edition is satisfactory and comes with a CD collection. You can also purchase the book without the CDs because all recordings are readily available on YouTube.com. If this is what you want, but can\u2019t even afford it, I\u2019d be happy to send you the book at no cost - just email me at heif02@netzero.net and provide you address. If you\u2019d like to become a composer, it\u2019s possible to purchase fairly accessible software compatible with your computer to assist you in many areas of music. Hope this was helpful and best of luck. ",
