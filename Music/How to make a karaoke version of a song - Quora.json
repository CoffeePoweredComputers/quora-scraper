            "answer_text": "You have three main options to get a karaoke version of a song: As Shruti said you can use voice cancelation on audio engineering software such as audacity or Ableton. However the voice removal will not be perfect (it's nearly impossible to separate entirely voice from music).You can also rewrite all the scores in midi format and make it play by virtual instruments. Logic or Ableton are good softwares for that purposes. Besides, Karaoke use this technology to create their karaoke catalogue.You can also use a service build for that (probably the easiest). For example you can try my app Cizoo that allows to sing a message to your friends. We have hundred of tracks and it's totally free. If you're not looking for an entirely customize karaoke experience, that's might help ;)",
