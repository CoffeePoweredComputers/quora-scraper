            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough question due to all the variables involved. I can give you a rough idea on the old business model, which isn\u2019t used much these days, but you\u2019ll get a rough idea. One hit song at a Million copies, let\u2019s say it\u2019s on an album. The album cost is $10.00, so now you have $10,000,000.00. The artist should be in there around 10% give or take, go ahead and give your artist a million bucks, seems like a good pay day doesn\u2019t it? Do you remember the girls from TLC? they filed bankruptcy after selling several million albums! Here\u2019s a little how those deals used to go down. Artist gets a check for a million bucks, their publisher will probably get around 50% of that(that\u2019s standard for a publisher), now you have half a million bucks left, hmm, who wrote the song? what if it\u2019s a collaboration of Two one wrote the music, and one wrote the lyrics? now each one of them has a quarter of a million, who\u2019s left to pay? is there a band involved? how about the producer? what about the manager and the lawyer, and this is if you signed a good deal with your label. There\u2019s still production cost, you know the studio where you cut the record? Do you see your money rushing away like a toilet being flushed? There\u2019s still some more little fingers in the pie. Do you remember Prince and his $100 million deal back in the 90s? it was unprecedented at the time. Do you remember Prince trading his name for a symbol, and walking around with the word slave written on his face? That $100 million looked good on paper, Prince found out the hard way, that\u2019s the only place it looked good at. In the end the label let him out of his contract, because he was costing them money, and that was around the time the old business model started it\u2019s death. Fast forward to the present, if you sell a million units, do you want a million bucks? if you were paying attention, don\u2019t do what they did! Keep the numbers down if you write and someone sings figure out how you\u2019re going to split it up front and think about all those sharks that I previously mentioned. For sake of ease, let\u2019s say you write and perform what you write, record those even if it\u2019s on a phone, download that to a disc and register it at The Library of Congress, songs(plural) for $55.00, now your music is protected! Now the rest is up to you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen all these folks on Quora asking about YouTube views and how to get their music noticed? There\u2019s a reason for the questions, If they\u2019re doing it right they\u2019ll maintain close to 100% of their earnings, but you have to have listeners before you have earnings! Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an exceptional writer, and you can deliver what you wrote, meaning you\u2019re damned good! How do you get noticed? how do you get traction? There needs to be something that sets you apart! don\u2019t copy people, but become an observer! Think about Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Lady GaGa, musically they aren\u2019t that great! but they made names for themselves pretty quick and got to keep most of their money. Weather one likes them or not, they\u2019re pretty damned bright, business wise. GaGa is kind of following in the footsteps of Madonna, Manson and Zombie are following in the steps of Alice Cooper or Kiss. All these folks are putting shock value in their music. You don\u2019t have to do what they did, but learn from it, what can you do that\u2019s different, but has the same effect on people, shock is probably getting old, Find something new, be a pioneer. Just Think a little differently, and keep all your music rights if you wrote the song and performed it. It\u2019s coming quick, the technology is there, a lot of rappers have already done it, but it\u2019s getting to where the artist is going  to be 100% independent, that\u2019s why they call it Indie. Good Luck Robert ",

            "answer_text": "OMG neither answer is correct actually. I know this why? Because I am a songwriter. I also record and sell my music. Truth is there is no black and white answer to this question. If you are just the singer it would depend on how your contact is written as it varies from artist to artist. In my case since I am also the songwriter and own 200 percent of all my songs I get more than a singer only would get. For a signed artist he may get 35\u201340 cents per dollar after all is said and done. If there are four band members then divide that by four. So in theory if you have a four member band and they sell a million songs at a dollar each song the each would get one hundred thousand dollars out of a million dollars. If my song is a dollar to download I get about sixty-five cents for an artist commission but I also collect about 12 cents royalty for a total of 77 cents per song. But as I said before it varies depending on what your contract states. For artists with managers they get even less. For many after the download site takes their cut and the manager takes his cut you could end up with only 50 cents out of every dollar. If you are signed to a label then it can be even less because they take a cut as well since they paid for the studio time and distribution. Don\u2019t forget on whatever you end up with you still have to also pay taxes on that amount. Suddenly my 77 cents becomes closer to 60 cents. Since I have no management company to pay and write my own material I get more than many artists. That said I don't sell nearly as many songs as they do. Truth is most artists make most of their money from touring. ",
