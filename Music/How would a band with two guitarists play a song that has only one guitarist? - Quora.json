            "answer_text": "Question: Are you talking about a cover song, where the part is already laid out for you? And there is an obligation to stay somewhat close to the original idea? Or, are you talking about creating a new part for a new song that has \u2018only\u2019 one guitar playing? While the two questions may seem similar, there are differences that\u2019s why I ask. In the first part of my question, the answer to \u2018adding\u2019 a guitar part to a cover song is dependent upon \u2018how true one wants to be to the original version\u2019. A new, exciting and flashy guitar solo might not fit the somber ballad it\u2019s being played on, and vice versa. I used to play with a singer/guitarist who had a bad habit of getting buried in the song. But it kinda fit his personality of not being the stronger alpha male type, if you know what I mean. His singing was good, but his guitar parts tended to be boring, monotone, and uninspiring. See my point? The easiest way to play a one guitar song with two axemen is to double the parts. Each guy for the most part, plays the same part the other guy is playing. You can even change the range of it and have one guy play open chords and the second one bar chord the song. Or, one guitar plays the melody, while the next guitar plays rhythm. That\u2019s kinda the \u2018guitar 101\u2019 way of doing things. Depending on the type of song you have, one guitar can chunk or 1/8 note the chords in the verse, while guitar number two let\u2019s the chords ring out in whole notes. Which is a proven Rock Music type of attack. If you want rhythmically change things, try having a guitar stab or attack \u2018in between\u2019 the vocal lines, while the second concentrates on playing with the drums and bass. The first guitar works on a chording rhythm with the vocal, while guitar number two strengthens the rhythm section. Guitar number one can also arpeggio the chords, while the second guitar player block chords the track. And the same holds true sonically as well. One guy plays clean and melodic, the other guy powerful and forces it. Like nature, there is a balance between the two that meet in the music. When one axe supports the rhythm, it frees up the lead guitar to add a second part, or maybe even counter what he is doing. The sky is the limit, you\u2019re only limited by your imagination. Good luck, and good playing! ",

            "answer_text": "There are very few modern song recordings in existence that can be played exactly like the recording with only one guitarist in a live situation. On some heavier rock albums, the rhythm guitar track may consist of 15\u201320 different recordings of the same guitar part, to keep it thick-sounding. Additionally, even where there is only one guitar player in the band, if the guitar plays a melody or solo, there is usually a continual rhythm guitar playing under it. In a lot of metal or progressive metal songs, you might have two rhythm guitars, and two- or three-part harmonies played on separate guitars, as well. There can also be different parts in different tones playing over or under them. A song that sounds as classic and straightforward as the Eagles\u2019 \u201cHotel California\u201d frequently has at least SEVEN distinct and different guitars playing different parts at once. The best approach is for the guitarists to break down the song, determine which sections of the song have more than one guitar part, and decide who will play each part. From there, each guitarist would double an single-guitar parts. ",
