The speaker may have the most powerful ideas and views, yet these are ultimately useless when there is no attention given. Listening is much more than just hearing. It is an active process and demands a conscious effort. It shows maturity and respect to the speaker. Most of us generally have a friend or family member that we can call whenever we need to vent or express any frustration. It is generally someone who is willing to \u2018listen\u2019 to us and put-up with our emotional out-pour or complaining even if he or she has nothing to do with the situation. Speaking every time and dominating every conversation is an unattractive quality and it devalues your credibility. So being a good listener is equally important. Thank You:) ",

            "answer_text": "Being a listener is good.Because when we listen we concentrate more on the particular topic and at the same time we observe them.Both these are good for our brain.We can learn a lot by being a listener.But to be speaker you should be so aware of what you are saying.Because your wrong words may affect the one who listen you.We have to think twice before we talk about anything but we don\u2019t have to do anything to be a Listener.
