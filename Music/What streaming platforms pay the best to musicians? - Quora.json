            "answer_text": "None of them pay what they should be paying, and never will\u2026 but from what I understand (from working with musicians over the years and having songs up myself) I would say it\u2019s a toss up between iTunes and Spotify. Apple iTunes is at least staying out of a lawsuit to sue and overturn parts of the new law signed last year to get artists and producers paid more of what their deserve - more on that below. It\u2019s a very minimal payment, often being cents - like 9 cents. It\u2019s not good and it\u2019s non-negotiable in many cases unless you are a big act that makes a lot of money for them by folks streaming your music. BUT\u2026. it\u2019s going to change, in a great way due to the \u201cMusic Modernization Act\u201d The Music Modernization Act has been signed into law signed in to law last October of 2018. Passed the house, the senate and signed by the president. It should be about a 40% raise in streaming royalties. It\u2019s too soon to see how fast they will implement the changes, and from what I understand there are already lawsuits filed by Spotify and possibly others to kill it or change it to benefit them more. But it is law now and they will have to comply. I\u2019m thinking in a few years we should see some type of movement on this. I, and thousands of others hope anyway. Songwriters and producers have been taken advantage of for so long\u2026 it just feels good to have a positive change. NSAI (Nashville Songwriters Association International) is the actual reason for this change. The former president, Bart Herbison, lobbied for it - he\u2019s a hero in a sense. Although, he drank the kool-aid (it seems), and it looks like he will be running for congress in an upcoming Nashville election. But that\u2019s another story altogether. At least we will have someone in office fighting for songwriter rights. It\u2019s a positive turn of events for sure. I would even go far as saying completely unexpected considering how bad the two parties of our government are getting along right now. But here we are! ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to really say that TIDAL, Napster, Pandora and such are the highest paying, but let's say their raters per stream are very favorable. The issue lies int he fact that their users are, well, not that many. So in the end YouTube, Spotify and Apple Music are probably the largest, therefore being the ones who pay best. You have the higher chances to be discovered there and the user base is so large that it's just better investing efforts into those. ",
