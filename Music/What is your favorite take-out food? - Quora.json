            "answer_text": "What is your favorite take-out food? That is a tough question to answer, because I love variety. It depends on the restaurant At McDonald's, I like the 'dollar mac', a McDouble with Mac sauce added. I don't go the whole yard and have them replace toppings to match the Big Mac, just add the sauce. At Burger King I go with the classic, the Whopper. At Wendy's, I like the taco salad, a salad in a taco shell with a side of chili. I usually don't put the chili on the salad, and just eat it as is. At Taco Bell it's the Crunch Wrap. Moe's has the Wrong Doug, which is a better Crunch wrap you can personalize, that might be one of the top 2 or 3 items I love anywhere. And at Captain D's is one of the 2 or 3 piece fish meals with hush puppies and a side. Probably, the one item that sits beside the Wrong Doug, is a cheese steak. Note I didn't say Philly Cheese steak, as that is what you usually get when away from Philly. A real grilled cheese steak with fried onions. ",

            "answer_text": "Burgers. Bacon ones are a special extra thing. Wendy\u2019s bacon cheeseburger\u2019s are amazing. They have this zesty amazing combination of ketchup, mayo, that mixes together perfectly with the rest of the package. Burger King is also great. You can\u2019t deny something special is going on when you drive by and smell the \u2018grilled food\u2019 scent. McDonald\u2019s Big Mac is also a treat. I enjoy the sauce and the extra bun balances out the whole thing, so it\u2019s just right. A mushroom swiss burger is also a joy to consume. ^_^ ",
