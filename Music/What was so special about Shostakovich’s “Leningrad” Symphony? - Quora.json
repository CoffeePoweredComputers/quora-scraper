            "answer_text": "Musically, it is not special; in my opinion (shared by the majority of conductors, based upon how rarely it is programmed), it is tedious and the least of his symphonic works. Bartok even parodied it in his \u201cConcerto for Orchestra\u201d by quoting an interminable canon from it and following with the bass trombone giving a \u201cBronx Cheer\u201d - it is simply not a good piece of music. It\u2019s the circumstances of its composition and premiere that give it its only \u201cspecial\u201d characteristic. It was written during the Nazi siege of Leningrad when people were dying of starvation by the thousands - literally in the streets. And the members of the orchestra were affected - sometimes they couldn\u2019t come to rehearsals because they were too weak from hunger. This captured the imagination and admiration of the Allies, which accounts for its brief popularity. But by the end of WWII, it slid into its (deserved) obscurity. ",

            "answer_text": "Shostakovich wrote his Seventh Symphony in 1941/1942, when the Second World War was in full swing. The nazi\u2019s had started the invasion of the Sovjet Union in June 1941 and the 872 days of the Siege of Leningrad had begun a few months thereafter.  Shostakovich\u2019s career had just been a heartbeat away from hell. In the mid-1930s Stalin had murdered thousands and thousands of people whom he considered a danger to his dictatorial power. Stalin had become paranoid; not only every dissident, but in fact every intellectual and everyone artistic had to fear for their lives, Shostakovich including. His music was considered too modernistic, too complicated, too dissonant, too artistic. In 1936, his recent opera The Lady MacBeth of the Mtsenk district and his not-yet-premiered Fourth Symphony put him in a very dangerous position. A newspaper article, titled 'Muddle instead of music', made him at once an enemy of the state. He was severely threatened with an arrest and thus a single ticket to the Gulags. He even slept in his staircase with a packed valise, to spare his family the humiliation of an arrest in his own home. His Fifth Symphony, from 1937, became his rehabilitation. It was written in a far more conveniant and approachable style; yet he also succeeded in expressing emotions of pain, terror and suppression, making the Fifth a favourite of the audience; the veiled sarcasm towards the Soviet authorities went unnoticed.  In 1941, Shostakovich lived and worked in Leningrad, when the nazi\u2019s marched towards his home city. When the siege began, the important people were soon evacuated, but Shostakovitch refused to leave, insisting in helping his city. He ended up as a voluntary firefighter on the rooftops of the conservatory of Leningrad. He also kept composing amidst the horror of the invasion and the siege of Leningrad. His Seventh symphony immediately became a symbol of resistance to the nazis and of Soviet pride. As soon as the symphony was finished, Shostakovich wanted the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra to premiere the symphony under his baton. However, the members of the orchestra and Shostakovitch himself were forced to evacuate the city. The world premiere took place March 5th, 1942, in Kuybyshev, in unoccupied Soviet Union. The symphony was first performed in the capital Moscow on Marth 29th, 1942. Soon thereafter, the symphony was smuggled out of the Soviet Union (because, even though it was war, the Soviet dictatorship and censorship still was in function). The European premiere was in London on June 22nd, 1942, exactly one year after the nazi invasion of the Soviet Union started, and the American premiere was in New York on July 19th, 1942.  On the 9th of August, the Leningrad premiere would finally follow. This date was chosen deliberately: Hitler had planned for the city to be conquered by then. On the 9th of August, he planned to have a big banquet in the Astoria Hotel in the centre of Leningrad to celebrate his victory. The orchestra was assembled with whatever professional musician they could find; some were part of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, some were soldiers. A lot of the musicians were on the brink of starvation and during the process, three musicians died. They could rehearse the entire symphony only once. Despite extra food being supplied by enthusiastic music lovers, the musicians found it almost impossible to rehearse properly; even though the rehearsal was supposed to take three hours, it was stopped after only 15 minutes. But the premiere was a huge morale booster for the people and soldiers of the Soviet Union. The Seventh also was broadcasted, through loudspeakers, to the German enemy as a way of psychological warfare. Before the premiere, the Soviet military forces conducted \u201cOperation Squall\u201d, bombing strategic German posts so that they would be unable to fire during the performance of the symphony.  Above all the first movement feels extremely proud and patriotic. It features military marches that are strechted out for long, almost banal moments. The powerful C-major motives feel invincible. Then, above a stubborn and almost irritating snare drum motif, we hear a tune from Lehar\u2019s operette Die lustige Witwe, one of Hitlers favorite operas, symbolizing the nazi invasion. It\u2019s repeated countless times, just like the obstinate snare drum motif. We hear both themes over and over again for such a long time that they get distorted, their initial \u2018meanings\u2019 are blurred into almost unrecognizable sounds. At the end of the first movement, the triumphant C-major prevails. But there are still three long, reflective movements ahead. Later, sources close to Shostakovich explained that the annoying \u2018nazi theme\u2019 was as much anti-Stalin as it was anti-Hitler. Shostakovitch likely was preparing the Seventh symphony a significant amount of time before the siege of Leningrad. For Shostakovich, the core of the symphony is not the mind-numbing military repetition, but the music that comes after that: a requiem-like sadness, followed by even sadder music which even Shostakovitch didn\u2019t know how to term. As he would often do in his later years, Shostakovitch toned down the idea of one event being the source of his irreverent, insubordinate compositions. For instance, the Eleventh symphony, that originally seemed to retell the Russian revolution of 1905, also echoed the events of 1956 in Hungary. Several symphonies after 1936 superficially retold a single event, but eventually told a broader story of tyranny, loss, sadness, suppression, suffering and grief. The symphonies no. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 all are tied not only to Shostakovich\u2019s personal life, but also to the social and political turmoil of the Soviet Union. All of these symphonies are strong statements for humanity and against totalitarianism, and the Seventh Symphony remains one of Shostakovich\u2019s most famous examples. ",
