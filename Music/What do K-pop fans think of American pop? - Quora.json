            "answer_text": "I know, that question might sound weird. But as someone who has been into kpop for 9 years, and barely listens to american pop\u2026 (I do like a few artists, but I\u2019m just a casual listener) I often wonder; what is american pop actually like, and how does it appear like when you are used to kpop ? Kpop has some specific aspects that we are used to, and that seem just\u2026 normal and common. And sometimes, they feel just so common to me, that I tend to forget that, well, it does not work the same everywhere. For example things like; -Comebacks with different hairstyle, hair colors, that are followed with a ton of live performance on korean music shows, fan meetings, meet and greets\u2026 -Kpop albums, with their huge photobooks, photocards that fans always get excited about, sometimes polaroid cards, idols message card, stickers, posters, and whatelse\u2026 -Korean entertainment shows, variety shows, with all their games, their particular editing, these are also really common and plays a big part into keeping the fans entertained and letting them know more about the group. -Just, kpop groups in general, composed with main singers, main rappers, main dancer, visual\u2026 They most of the time make songs with singing parts and rap parts. Choreographies also play a really important part in kpop. -Fanservice, that can goes just for things that idols do for fans, to idols playing games that fans want to see, to idols just wearing anything cute/ridiculous fan bring them at fansign. -The whole fansite thing; it is also a really important part of kpop, kpop idols always have a ton of fansites, that post almost daily pictures of them, and sometimes the fansites holder can be pretty young, these people are regular fans that just give a lot of time to these idols, to be able to capture them, and share them completely freely with other fans, without excepting anything. I\u2019ve seen some people comparing it to \u201cpaparazzis\u201d but no matter how deep I look into it, I never saw Shawn Mendes or Nicky Minaj wearing stupid headbands and doing supposedely cute faces towards their fansite just to feed them and the fans. I\u2019ve even seen some idol asking their fansites \u201cPlease edit these pictures well and make me look cute!\u201d So yeah, I think you get the point. Kpop really has a lots of points that seem so casual, normal, usual, common, that I sometimes tend to forget that, it doesn\u2019t work exactly like that. And I was wondering if some Kpop fans sometimes get a bit lost with American pop due to Kpop ? I thought about this first, when I saw one of my friend unboxing Ariana Grande\u2019s album and I was so lost for a moment like \u201cWhere\u2019s your photobook ? Where\u2019s the photocard ? Don\u2019t you get stickers, posters, cards, picture banners\u2026 ?\u201d and then I realized that, well, I\u2019m just so used to Kpop that these things just seem casual to me, when it\u2019s actually not in American pop industry.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve not been interested in pop music for decades. I\u2019m a classic rock fan, original Beatles fan, and just never had ANY interest in the bland pop music in America. Elevator muzak LOL Even bands like Kansas, Boston, REO Speedwagon, ELO, Journey, Foreigner - just blended to gether in my head (although I do like some of THEIR stuff) - the offerings of such pop artists as the Captain and Tennille, the Partridge Family, & other bubblegum artists in the 70s made me gag. Pop music in the 80s & 90s took rather a back seat to other genres (like hair bands, punk rock, emo, grunge, etc) and by the turn of the century I was listening to world music a LOT. I always did like the MoTown sound, soul, funk, R&B, the blues. Hip hop & rap had some cool rhythms but the lyrics usually made me gag. Loved Queen Latifah tho! Therefore, when I found KPop, I saw a real connection to MoTown & funk there. Current pop music in America is mainly bland, boring and predictable. Some is great but most is meh. ",
