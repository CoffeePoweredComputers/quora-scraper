With Sony though, I had to format the card in the device (Xperia Phone) and then connect to PC via charging cable(make sure it\u2019s a good cable, recent) and copy the files over the old fashioned way by dragging and dropping with the Windows File Explorer. Now all my audio is showing in the apps on the phone. It\u2019s a pain and time consuming but it works. ",
