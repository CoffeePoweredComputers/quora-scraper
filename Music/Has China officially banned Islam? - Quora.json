No matter if Americans wants to build a mosque in the site of fallen towers or if Turkey wants to support their \u201cbrothers\u201d to build a east Turkistan, or BBC accuses China for \u201crepressing the Islamic minorities\u201d, China has her terrorism issues and has her own way of dealing with it. I guess you have never seen the scene the Uygher people hunting the terrorists, or been told there are more than 100 million Muslims in China. Officially banning Islam is never gonna happen. ",

This is not there traditional dress it was imported during the Afghan war and now there are in China. So good for the ban.  They are famous for dancing and singing. Somehow some rebel Imam start preaching that it is sinful to sing and dance. Some muslims even complain about it when there family member wedding there was no traditional singing and dancing. So good for protecting there tradition.  It is true that the holy book did say that muslims are only allow to marriage muslims. Again religion are not allow to interfer with people marriage. So good for the goverment to prtect the marriage law. Conclusion: China do not ban islam they even protect Islam, but they also protect there tradition and culture. As long as Islam do not take there tradition and culture away from them. ",

But in highschool or university they are all free to do it and may get official suport, for example almost evey university will provide islam people a early breakfest and a later dinner specially by the Ramadan. Also in the goverment who join the CCP are also not allowed to practice it, because when join the party, they sware they are not religion. ",

For years the Chinese government has been trying to show the world they are open to different religions. However a lot of stuff said in the article is also true. Unfortunately it is not because of the religion. A lot of people in Xinjiang felt left out in China (to be fair, so is every other civilians here when it comes to the Chinese politics). They feel more connected to Turkey than China. There have been a lot of signs of rebellions. Those strict \u201claws\u201d mentioned in the article are for citizens in Xinjiang, whether you are a muslim or not. ",

In Ningxia province there are lots of Islamic temple(I hope this is not offensive,don't know the accurate word), and almost every university in China has Islamic cateen.How could China do all these things and ban this religion. I just describe this thing objective and neutral. ",

            "answer_text": "Warning: Harsh answer. But I promise you it is not coming from a place of hate for Muslims, it is (what I believe to be) the truth behind the current predicament. Because I\u2019ve seen so many Muslims become victims of mindless hate, both in India and in the UK.  The answer: I\u2019m sorry to say your people are so gullible. Anybody can use you as rag-dolls and throw you by the wayside\u2026 as the foreign intelligence agencies have been doing for years. Muslims, collectively, will continue to be the degenerates they are until they actually start using logic and rationale to come to their decisions instead of mindlessly grouping under a religious identity and spreading narratives somebody else has created for you people to serve their own interest. \u2026 now, to be specific - why does the article mention: \u201cMuslims cannot wear clothing or logos associated with extremism. No ISIS flags or patches allowed.\u201dDo you think you would be treated any better if you were to wave ISIS flags in the UK, USA, Europe, Pakistan, Indonesia, or even Saudi Arabia? The article is written to subliminally guide you toward a position where you become terrorist-sympathisers in the eyes of the public\u2026 for political gain. The author of the article is indeed an Islamophobe with a political agenda. My advice to Muslim individuals: Stop being f*cked in the head by your fundamentalist Qazis/Imams/scholars.Stop being f*cked in the head by Anglo West media (directors, executives, editors, journalists) exercising their own political agenda. Editors and journalists are hired and promoted to do a job. Anglo West MSM survives because it is able to serve the political class of their respective countries. Those political classes don\u2019t actually give a sh*t about your religion, ethnic group, nation, or continent.Become the public representatives of your own logic and rationale - as individuals, AND not always under the guise of a religious identity.If you do, ordinary (brainwashed) people might actually start treating you with respect - and see you as individuals too.",
