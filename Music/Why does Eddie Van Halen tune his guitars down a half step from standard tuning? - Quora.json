            "answer_text": "Many people do this. KISS did. I even know some local bar bands who do it. I believe Nirvana did it; sometimes more than a half step. It makes string tension slightly less so the strings are easier to push down, there\u2019s s slightly bassier sound. You\u2019ll see it more frequently in guitar only bands - no keyboard player to confuse. When i I was a kid guitarists couldn\u2019t (or didn\u2019t want to) play the Beatles \u201cyesterday\u201d. It was in F and had chords acoustic guitarists hate - F, Bb, etc. It wasn\u2019t until years later I realized that the guitar was tuned a whole step lower. So while the guitar was playing easy chords; G, Bm, Em, C etc, what was coming out was F, Am, Dm, Bb. The song is MUCH easier to play in G, with a lot of nice big open chords. ",

            "answer_text": "Down tuning a half step does three things. First it makes it easier for the singer to hit the high notes. Secondly it makes the guitar a little easier to play with slack strings. But most importantly, it browns out the sound of the band just a little. Everything's just a bit mellow. I think Eddie was going for that more mellow effect. Most rock songs are in E or A, that's the nature of the guitar. For Van Halen and a ton of other 70s / 80s bands, they are in Eb or Ab. It's just a little more mellow. And I think it goes back to Jimi Hendrix, who influenced a ton of guitarists. Half step down is an \u201ceffect.\" ",
