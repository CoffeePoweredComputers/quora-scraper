            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve read I\u2019m not sure she is a baptised Jehovah\u2019s witness. But I cannot be 100% certain of that. If she is then she has to answer to the elders and Jehovah for any immoral behaviour according to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and could be disfellowshipped. But she has to be baptised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness to be disfellowshipped. People can claim to be Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses but if they are not baptised then they are not unless they are an unbaptised publisher whom the elders have approved as a publisher. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not approve of sex before marriage. I think confirmation as to all this would have to come from Serena herself. ",

She was raised as a Witness and, to my knowledge, members of her family still are active Witnesses. But at some point during her career, she didn\u2019t identify herself as a Witness. Further reading: r/exjw - Selena's dad is still a JW and doesn't want her birth or death celebrated. ",
