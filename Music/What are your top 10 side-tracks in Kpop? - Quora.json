            "answer_text": "EDIT: I just got into some more music and decided to add some songs as honorable mentions (basically some more songs since they said top-10) This is an update adding on to it. No order as well. Seventeen - Good to MeA.C.E. - Black and BlueONEUS - Intro: TimeJUS2 - LONG BLACKTaemin - ThirstyCLC - I NEED UVillain - Luhvin ItTVXQ! - Sooner Than LaterLay - Amusement ParkTWICE - TURN IT UPHmmm\u2026 this is sorta hard, but I'll try. In no order whatsoever. From the artists ATEEZ, SKZ, BTS, EXO, SF9, NCT, KEY, and 1TEAM. (+ CLC, A.C.E., SVT, JUS2, ONEUS, TAEMIN, Villain, TVXQ!, 1.) ATEEZ - Desire. (TREASURE EP. 2 Zero to One < album). I was gonna say HALA HALA but this one is just sjsjsjk. It makes me wonder how someone managed to make a song this good. The beat and melody is everything (me exaggerating,, but stILL). The title track for this album is Say My Name, just gonna add this here. 2.) 1TEAM - Countdown. 1TEAM (\uc6d0\ud300) - Countdown (Color Coded Han|Rom|Eng Lyrics/\uac00\uc0ac) (Hello!\u2014EP < album). This group just debuted last month, and I have to say, their debut was solid. Nevermind,, not solid, the debut was a fucking brick wall; it was perfect. They only have 3 songs and the title track is Vibe. The song changes between two fast and slow paces. And the beat drop was amazing. I recommend. 3/4.) Stray Kids - Chronosaurus/Maze of Memories. (Cl\u00e9 1 : MIROH < album) I'm sorry, I couldn't choose. The first one, Chronosaurus lowkey reminds me of \u2018Natural\u2019 by Imagine Dragons for some reason. And Maze of Memories is like a rap battle of something like that. All the members\u2014yes, even the vocalists\u2014take turns rapping one at a time; in Korean, then in English at the end. MIROH is the title track. gold album. 5.) SF9 - Fall In Love. (NARCISSUS < album) I don't really stan SF9 but I'm getting to it. This song reminds me of SEVENTEEN's Adore U but not really. It has a sad tinge to it. It sounds really sad. I haven't looked at the lyrics yet, so I'll probably get to it. Also, the tile track is Enough. 6/7.) KEY - Good Good/Chemicals. (FACE - The 1st Album < album) I had a hard time with this one. He has an album I would call a gold album, which means (I feel) there are no bad songs. He has this type of EDM style, I would say. He really likes to experiment with his sound and has sometimes unusual sounds as his background that sound really good. 10/10 my dudes. Good Good makes me wanna scream; the electric guitar (?) in the background during the key part (hehe, get it,, KEY\u2014man I'm funny) is satisfying. Chemicals has a good beat drop. Title track is One Of Those Nights ft. Crush. 8.) NCT 127 - Angel. NCT 127 - Angel [Audio] (LIMITLESS - 2nd Mini Album - EP < album) I was \u2018bouta pick Whiplash (hem hem ;)) I know what you're thinking, and you're right,, go ahead\u2014look at them lyrics,, I dare you.) but this song popped up in my head immediately so I had to add it on here. It is very calming, and the guitar in the background melding with Haechan's voice is soothing. The title track is LIMITLESS, which is one of my favorite songs. So good. 9.) BTS - Tomorrow. (School Luv Affair < album) I remember being a new ARMY and playing SuperStar BTS to help me with memorizing songs and have fun at the same time. When I first heard Tomorrow, I felt euphoria. I still do to this day. Outro: Tear was a close second but on decided on this song. Namjoon's rap,, that's all you need to know. Title track is Boy in Luv. 10.) EXO - EL DORADO. (The Second Album \u2018EXODUS' < album) I really love this song\u2014it makes me wanna cry sometimes. Especially during Baekhyun's high notes. The instrumentals are great, too. It sound almost too good. Been through was about to take over but I decided on this one. Title track is Call Me Baby. My dudes, it took me an hour to write this and I didn't even realize. So sorry. I hope you guys try to listen to some of these recommendations. Thanks! ",
