            "answer_text": "I presume you mean first physical move. That being said, I have rarely encountered a woman under the age of 35 making the first move. When they do, it\u2019s usually unmistakable although chances are she\u2019s been sending out \u2018signals\u2019 that I wasn\u2019t able to read, so she just got frustrated and went for it herself. (When women get older, they\u2019re much less inclined to play games.) When I was a young teen, I\u2019d do things like if I was sitting with a girl, I\u2019d ask a girl if I could see her ring. She\u2019d hold out her hand. I\u2019d then take her hand, look at the ring, and then I just wouldn\u2019t let go. If we were parked in a car or at the movie theater, I\u2019d stretch out both arms and yawn. When I brought my arms back down, I\u2019d just put one around her. In my 20s/early 30s, I was a lot more confident and when the moment was right (usually a pause in the conversation) I\u2019d just reach in and go for a kiss. Once in a while I\u2019d misread the situation and she\u2019d pull back, but most of the time she didn\u2019t and kissed me back. By my late 30s and beyond, I was married. No first moves at all. ",
