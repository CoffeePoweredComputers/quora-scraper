            "answer_text": "Below I have copied and pasted my answer to How does instrumental music cause emotional responses?, a question not too dissimilar to yours: This is a very broad question, so an attempt at a rigorous answer would be very long, and I will instead offer my own perspective on a small but important element of music. The Wikipedia article on Music and Emotions is perhaps a good place to investigate a more general answer to your question, and you can read the sources if you are interested in going deeper. Before I begin my answer, allow me to paraphrase Dr. Marshall Tuttle, a composer who responded to my question of \u201cWhat is music?\u201d over email earlier this month: What is music?Organized sound.What organization?There's the rub! It is not natural, it is cultural. In fact it is a mirror of the way in which a culture projects order onto the universe. And there is the answer: music is a projection of a social agreement about how to be. Different cultures have different metaphors and therefore different ways of ordering and parsing reality. Every piece of music consists of relationships projected onto the sound world. What and how music means, whether the meaning is abstract or concrete, is encoded in these relationships. As an amateur music theorist, I can offer my personal perspective on how harmony, which is just one of many elements of music (timbre, melody, rhythm, etc. being other elements), can work in a functional sense. Western European art music of the common practice period constructed a system of relationships between chords that effectively controlled the treatment of consonance and dissonance. A consonance is simply a sonority that is considered stable while a dissonance is considered unstable and needing resolution to a consonant sonority. The actual rules for defining consonances and dissonances are culturally determined and continue to change, but several axiomatic principles helped to lay the foundation for this system, which is frequently called tonality. While the study of a centuries-old European artistic tradition may seem obsolete and antiquated now, the true influence and pervasiveness of tonality is immense: it is employed in a myriad of musical genres and styles across the world today. The rigorous study of tonality and its rules and conventions comprises an entire undergraduate music theory curriculum, so to cut directly to the chase and answer the question of how harmonic choices can encode semantic or emotional weight is not an easy task. However, here is a quick explanation: Phrases in tonal music typically go from consonances to consonances, and the principles of tonal centricity mandate that the governing consonance of a phrase, and often an entire work, be the same consonance (called a tonic), so this is where we get the concept of a piece being in a key, e.g. C major or A minor. So if a well-behaved tonal piece has C as its tonic, we know what the starting and ending chords will be: consonant chords built on C! The middle is where the other functions come into play. There are chords which function to prepare the tonic, called dominant chords, and there are chords that function to prepare dominant chords, called pre-dominant chords. There can also be chords that function as pivots to establish a new tonal center (e.g. going from C major to G major). In my opinion, the precise manipulation of functional chords in this seemingly simple playground is what creates semantic and emotional meaning. For example, say a piece has the following progression: tonic\u2014tonic\u2014pre-dominant\u2014pre-dominant\u2014dominant\u2014non-tonic! The first five sonorities would set up the listener with a strong expectation to hear the tonic stated again, but the deliberate deviation from it on the last chord could create a variety of possible effects ranging from a jarring feeling to a feeling of failed resolution to anger to sadness, depending on the numerous other elements of music that I mentioned earlier. Take another example progression: tonic\u2014pivot\u2014new tonic\u2014pre-dominant (of new tonic)\u2014dominant (of new tonic)\u2014old tonic A number of expressions can be gleaned from this depending on how a listener hears it: on the surface, it is a failure to achieve tonal closure in a new key, but is it indicative of an inability to be comfortable outside of home? A stubborn refusal to change? An insistent beckoning of a familiar entity despite being in a new environment? Analyzing and interpreting the meaning of music is a much messier task than music theorists deal with, and thus it is usually left to semioticians and semanticians. My apologies for the abstraction and lack of aural examples in this answer! If you are interested in understanding harmony and meaning on a deeper level, I recommend Marshall Tuttle\u2019s books, Musical Structures in Wagnerian Opera and Modal Ethos and Semiotics in Tonal Music.

            "answer_text": "Music is a critical part of the daily routine of a human being. People listen to music for a variety of different reason. Some listen for entertainment, to induce sleep, for motivational purposes etcetera. Researchers have claimed that, regardless of the reason for listening to the music, the songs have a significant effect on the brain that makes them necessary for the human beings. They have the ability to stimulate intense human emotions in a person. It is for this reason that most people listen to music. This paper addresses the mechanisms through which the intense emotions in an individual are evoked by music. It answers the research question, \u201cWhy do human beings discern emotional information present in the musical features\u201d. There have been many studies that help in explaining how music affects emotions. Juslin and Sloboda (2001), writes about the results found on researching the topic regarding the broad perspectives of philosophy, musicology, biology, psychology, sociology and anthropology. Also, Cohen A. (2001) also addresses the relationship between music and emotions by comparing the subject to characters of a film. He continues by emphasising that the same way music affects movie characters and their experiences are the same way it affects humans in the real world. Kone?ni, J. (2008) conducts a theoretical and methodological study on both ordinary people and psychologists to find out if and how music affects their emotions. The findings of this research support that music enhances low-grade feelings in people and has a significant influence in their routine activities. This research examines the reasons behind the perception of strong emotions as a result of listening to music. It focusses on the universal emotions like joy, happiness, nostalgia, sadness, tension, and relaxation. Furthermore, the study aims at taking a scientific approach to explain the effect music has on the human brain. The brain stimulates emotions in a body. Therefore, anything that induces emotions in a person must affect it. In addition, the study helps in relating the different types of songs and the mixed emotions they can result in a person. A major part of the research will be conducted by reviewing existing literature regarding the effect of music and emotions. The academic materials like peer-reviewed articles and books will provide the necessary knowledge on the parts of the human brain that are responsible for human emotions and how these parts are affected by music. Other materials will include pictures from neuroimaging equipment that show the exact brain areas that are activated by music. ",

            "answer_text": "Music has the ability to change our feelings and emotions with respect to the music type. Like if we are listening to some pop music it just pumped us up and we begin to dance and an enjoyable environment is created. But if we are feeling low with some kind of stress or suffering from some critical situations then we like to hear some slow and soft music which help us to get relax and calm. After listening such songs it reduces the stress and we could able get a good sleep. On the other hand, if we are listening to some old songs it will remind us of our past and we feel happiness or sadness according to the respective memories. Sometimes music changes our mood instantly because music is of different types. Different musical instruments which make people crazy from their latest and amazing sounds. Few of the famous musical instruments like Irish harp, Irish flute, Irish bouzouki, and other instruments.  Lyrical music is what that directly hits the soul of a person and convey its message completely. On the other hand, lyrical music is also an attention seeking type who engages the person within its wordings and if wording somehow relates with his life it gets deeper into the emotions either they are positive or negative.  Music actually affects a person in different ways like if a person is distressed from his daily workload and music is what gives him pleasure and exposure in order to remove its negativity. There is a certain type of emotions like which includes aggressive and violent behavior, hopelessness, joy, humbleness, and sadness which overcomes with the passage of time. But during such some moments, we like to hear related songs according to our emotions and feelings. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re just asking about melodies, no words, just a sequence of musical tones and how they each evoke in us very specific feelings, the way to address that is to sit down in front of a keyboard and strike middle C, then the D above, etc. all the white keys one after the other until you strike the octave above middle C. Keep doing this (very slowly so you can savor and compare) until you have registered the different feelings the evoke. But they are not ordinary everyday sentiments, or we would have words in our vocabulary for them and we do not; I know of no language that identifies the special feelings evoked by musical intervals. Once you have established a current of feelings evoked by the sequence of notes, play the black key which is E flat instead of E and feel the huge difference. Alternate between the two notes, E flat and E, all the while intermittently striking the C for the reference tone because notes on their own evoke almost nothing; it\u2019s when notes are in relationships with other notes (called pitch intervals) that they begin to evoke the feelings. What you will notice (sorry for sounding didactic, this is what I do for 44 years, lecture in music courses in universities as guest lecturer on a special form of music appreciation) is that the yearning feeling that appears when we play the C - E flat interval clears up the instant we play the C - E interval. Because the minor interval (C - E flat) induces yearning for the harmony of the major interval (C - E). I have demonstrated this effect for many thousands of music students and their professors, in USA, Canada, Europe and Asia and the response is universal. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what reason the person has to listen to music. There are three general types of music listeners: those who listen music for the message in the lyrics, those who listen for the aesthetic (beat, instruments, singing ability) and those who listen for both reasons. People who listen to music because of its lyrics tend to be emotionally affected by what the narrator in that song tries to say, as if they\u2019re the only two people in the world. Understanding that song by its words is like listening to a conversation for ideas. People who listen to music for the aesthetic like me often feel like wandering through different emotions and even worlds. For examples, classical music always convey a story if that person listens to the details carefully like the tempo and loudness. Foreign-language songs have that certain magic that makes you feel it despite the language barrier. Of course people have different interpretations of a certain song despite its nature and more often than not, people get it wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm.. Music is a reflection of the culture we live in. It is the hallmark of our thought. It can give you values or affect your life choices! It can build peace and harmony or lead to disrupted life patterns. It is a healer, it can play havoc! The objectification of women in Indian pop music and music videos can very easily be related to the attitudes towards women in general. In the other hand, there are very few songs that let a woman have a image of a dreamer, an independent individual or a emotionally strong person. Rehman's dil hai chota sa does have an adolescent individuality but there are nothing to match hero by Mariah Carey or the climb from Hannah Montana. Similary for guys, there are few songs that inspire them to be strong and responsible individuals. Most songs are about attraction and heart breaks, as if that is the sole purpose of human existence! Some songs like payega joh laksh hai tera, sure add value but so much more is required. Sufi and other spiritual songs are perhaps the only decent break from the monotonous din about youth and relationships. Allah ke bande haste or Jai jai Kedara are beautiful compositions. There is much more we need. Also, there are children, elderly, newcomers to city or different phases of life, people who are pursuing some dreams and so many other people who would be happy to have songs that can relate to their life. Music beyond lovers and losers can possibly create more substantial people and change not just happy mood or sad, but can actually create proud identities. Look at all those anthem songs from west and some recent cult hits like rang de basanti and chak de India! Music can do wonders. Let's hope people create wonderful songs one more time. ",

But I have an inner world where some emotions can exist with imagination. And, when listening to music, I can feel plenty of things. That's where I have a glimpse of what normal people may feel. Why? Maybe because music is real, but I live it as an inner experience. Are my emotions with music like yours? I cannot know for sure. I am an amateur musician and I see music as my way to communicate emotionally. I specially enjoy powerful, intense and passionate music, no matter the instrumentation, the style or the mood.

I played it for a friend and he sat back on his chair, closed his eyes, and looked as if he was watching a movie of his life passing by, in deep contemplation. I once played it for a coworker, and she broke down crying. One piece has so many different reactions and so many emotional responses. I have no clue why or how that happens.
