            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson did not lip-sync completely during his HIStory tour as some people have said. I'm glad you asked this question because it's a good example of how so many negative rumors surrounded Michael during this period in his life-this being one of them. All the way back to the second leg of his Bad Tour in 1988 Michael realized that it was just too hard on him to try to sing and dance for two hours straight. I'd like to see anyone attempt that and watch the result. What he decided to do back then was live sing all the ballads and the songs that didn't require a lot of dancing like Wanna Be Starting Something, and lip-sync huge dance numbers like Billie Jean and Smooth Criminal. But even in those songs he would always add live parts of them when he felt the need. One fact that people need to be aware of is that Michael suffered from mild to moderate lung disease. The entire world found this out after his autopsy in 2009 but he had known that his voice was getting weaker at times when he over used it. It is now commonly believed that he suffered lung erosion as a child performer because he was forced to sing so much in smoke filled clubs. Believe it or not Michael had planned on live singing every single number for his This Is It Concerts. That's how dedicated he was to his last show and I think it also shows the extent of his professionalism throughout his life. I don't think that would have worked out that well for his voice at that juncture but perhaps because he had taken such a long break from performing his voice would actually have been stronger for those shows. We will obviously never know the answer to that question but I have huge admiration for him for even considering such an idea in order to give the best shows possible for his loyal fans and especially for his children who had never had the opportunity to see him perform live at all. Anyway, back to the HIStory tour. He definitely performed some live songs. As a matter of fact, the reason that he saved the song Earth Song for last was because it absolutely killed his voice. I'm sure you have listened to it and can sympathize with that decision. He also sang Wanna Be Starting Something(that was a tradition for him), Stranger In Moscow, and the opening of the concert with the excerpts from many of his new and some old songs. He also live performed the J5 medley as he always did. Ironically, the biggest criticism that he dealt with in terms of the tour was the fact that he only sang portions of songs instead of the whole numbers. I feel that this is a ridiculous criticism because he wouldn't have been able to give such a great sampling of so many wonderful songs if he had performed them fully and forget about his voice. He wouldn't have made it through the songs he did sing if he had chosen that fan and critic \u201cpreferred\u201d route. I'm telling you, this man could do no right when it came to pleasing everyone and so he went with what he thought would make for the best tour possible. For months leading up to the tour he worked daily with his voice coach, Seth Riggs, for sometimes 3 to 4 hour sessions. Now why would he have gone to that trouble if he was not planning on singing during the concerts. It's just common sense-right? The rumor about his not singing even spread to his back-up singers. Apparently, according to those rumor spreaders out there they did not sing a note either. How ridiculous would that have been. Michael was probably the most dedicated performer to have ever been in the music business. Every facet had to be perfect. So it doesn't make a bit of sense that he would have copped out in the way that the rumors say. He lived to perform and adored his fans and so would never have tried to cheat them in such a terrible way. Let's just leave the real lip-synching to Milli Vanilli shall we and just get on with giving Michael Jackson the real credit he's due. One more point if you don't mind. Have you listened to Michael Jackson's Invincible album lately? Do us both a favor would you, and just put it on. And after listening to an album that was published in 2001 tell me how it would have been possible to perform that incredibly while assuming his voice was gone 4 years earlier. I'm not saying he didn't have voice issues in 1997\u20131988 but I am saying that they were nothing like what the rumor mills would have you believe. And if Michael was having a bad couple of days he would actually cancel concerts rather than go out there and not give it his all. That, my friend, is the ethical standards of one hell of a performer. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a excerpt from an article on this very subject. Honestly watching This Is It there was considerable lip syncing going on. That said those were mainly practice sessions. The more I have studied Michael\u2019s live concerts from this era, the more it has occurred to me that what he was essentially melding together was all part of a grand concept-or at least, his grand concept-of what a live musical performance should be. It was a unique concept but, nevertheless, one steeped in postmodern ideas of both visual and musical art. In literary postmodern art, concepts such as the pastiche, intertextuality, and temporal distortion were all changing the way stories were being told, and perceived. These concepts were likewise being carried over to other art forms, including both visual and musical. Let\u2019s not forget that it was these postmodern concepts, after all, which gave us a whole new musical art form known as sampling, whereby the idea of building on something familiar (i.e, a familiar hook from a well known song) is used to create something entirely new. In the case of sampling, it\u2019s usually a given that the artist isn\u2019t attempting to pull anything over on the public-quite the contrary, they know that a familiar riff or hook is going to be instantly recognized. That familiarity becomes a kind of foundation or groundwork from which the artist then expands with a new vision. Modern sampling is very much the musical equivalent of pastiche, in which several styles may be blended to form a new, cohesive whole, and also intertextuality, in which a previous work is acknowledged and built into the new text. In live concert, Michael was using his own studio recordings in much the same way, to create a kind of visual and auditory temporal distortion. Rather than viewing the live concert as merely a string of performances tied together, Michael was creating a series of connective narratives, both visual and musically, in which the familiar studio recordings were very much an integral part of the process. Today, these types of theatrical narratives are often very much a part of the modern concert experience. We may rest assured that Michael\u2019s incorporation of pre-recorded tracks into his performances had nothing to do with a slacker mentality, but rather, everything to do with being a visionary artist who was ushering in a whole new, postmodern concept of live performance. But this still leaves a burning question. Just how much of these latter performances were, indeed, illusion and how much actual, live vocals? And is it possible to always tell? The answer may surprise you, Many make the mistake of simply trusting their ears to tell them when a performance is \u201clive\u201d; conversely, many rely on techniques for spotting a lip synced performance that are not always entirely accurate, either. The truth is that the engineers behind live performances are privy to many industry tricks of the trade. What the audience actually \u201chears\u201d (via the soundboard output) can be manipulated many ways. \u201cLive\u201d vocals can be spliced with \u201cstudio\u201d vocals, or even previously recorded \u201clive\u201d vocals, so that what we may get-rather than a purely live or purely lip synced performance-can, in fact, be a hybrid of both. A performer\u2019s mike can be turned \u201coff\u201d or \u201con\u201d at any given time throughout a performance-and, if turned \u201coff\u201d can be instantly turned \u201con\u201d to allow a live vocal to take over from a tracked vocal. Michael had, by the time of the HIStory tour, become a master of all the tricks and illusions of the trade. He knew when he needed to \u201csave\u201d his voice and when it was absolutely essential that he \u201csing out\u201d; he knew what parts could safely be lip synced without loss of quality or integrity and what numbers-or what part of a number-absolutely had to be live. And I will stress again, this was not by any means the work of a slacker, but rather, the work of a perfectionist craftsman who knew, instinctively, how to give the best theatrical experience possible to an audience. There was a lot more to the article that this small piece I posted and you can read the whole article here. The Truth About Michael and Lip Syncing: A Rare Soundboard Recording May Hold The Key ",

But, we all forget that he had an extensive career with his brothers for 20 years. Michael along with all the brothers in Jackson 5 and the Jacksons had performed almost 500 concerts, on record. Maybe even more than that. List of concert tours by Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5 - Wikipedia This does not include his brothers\u2019 performances in night clubs, parties, amateur contests, in which again they would have performed easily a 500 performances, if not more and this was before they had their big break. Michael also had 3 big solo tours in which only in his last world tour - HIStory Tour, he\u2019s lip-synced. In Bad Tour, there were 123 concerts, in which everything was performed live, sometimes with the exceptions of smooth criminal and the first part of man in the mirror. In the Dangerous tour, he would also sometimes lip-sync to thriller and black or white. In HIStory tour, only J5 Medley and WBSS were performed live. In the first leg, he also sang They don\u2019t care about us, beat it, billie jean after the moonwalk, dangerous till the smooth criminal part and the way you make me feel live. What we also forget is that Michael was a master of a whole another different art as well - dance, so he had to give that as well, where there was no compromising. ",

I thought he was different and would never do such a thing since he always seemed to put unrivaled energy in his live performance. To be honest i think i was in denial. 1995 MTV Music video awards, lip synced Dangerous and the very slow ballad that does not require dancing You are not alone  Germany 1997 he lip synced Blood on the dance floor and it does not require much dancing  I found an excuse for him that since he was dancing which causes anyone to run out of breath thereby making it hard to sing and dance at the same time he had to lipsync but then i remembered this performance Bucharest 1992, Jam  I think Michael no longer really cared due to the public ridicule that he was experiencing that started in 1993 when was accused of molesting Jordan Chandler. In 2001 he reverted to actually singing below he sings The way you make me feel featuring Britney Spears  ",

When songs or ballads didn't need a lot of gyrating or moonwalking he did only few magic moves hips sidewalking or didn't move at all(Superbowl performance is mostly remembered for the entrance and over 3 minutes looking at the crowd, magic that only Michael can pull) he sang himself otherwise he did lip sync but masterfully. In positive note many singers and performers were against using prerecorded material but the big cats were the ones that decided yes or no and some acts dropped their shows because of that (Iron Maiden didn't accept to do Top of Pops if they weren't allowed to sing live) and especially after Milli Vanilli disaster(check it out) and Michael as perfectionist that was can't be noticed if he did a lot or not. Michael was a showman and he is remembered for his singing but accepted to use prerecorded songs so he could dance at the end of day he is the Best Dancer of all times. ",

Early on, it was because he either needed to focus on his dancing or didn\u2019t have the necessary stamina. If you look at the Bad tours, you\u2019ll often hear him running out of breath. In one of his earlier tours, he sang really fast, probably so he wouldn\u2019t get winded. Later on, though, it was likely just a case of not caring. He\u2019s said before that he doesn\u2019t like performing live, and coupling that with all of the crippling allegations could result in a simple lack of motivation to perform at his best. You can even see that after the Bad era, his moves start to get stiffer. Deep down, he loves the feeling of getting up on stage and dancing his heart out and loves every one of his fans, but the chokehold that the media had on him and his not-exactly-being-in-his-physical-prime may have been enough to suffocate some of that.

He performed live as a member of the Jackson 5, and he performed live on the Victory Tour. He sang live on the Bad World Tour as well. Many(not all) of the songs in his Dangerous World Tour was performed live. Poor Michael had a throat problem(I guess laryngitis) during his HIStory World Tour, so he lip-synced to most of the songs, and added live vocals only towards the end or as ad-libs. He was fine in the 2000s. He may have even performed live once again, had he done his \u201cThis Is It\u201d tour. ",

On the dangerous tour, it was almost down the middle. Half were sung live, half weren\u2019t. And in the history tour, the majority was lip synced, few weren\u2019t. However, there is a good excuse considering he had laryngitis during most of it and drug problems. ",

I wasn\u2019t a huge fan, but that still sucked!) ",

Seen The Who years later, also in Liverpool, totally live, real singing and natrual now that was an amazing show. ",
