            "answer_text": "From multiple sources that I have read in the past and from knowledge I believe there are around 360\u2013370 Greek deities to name \u2014 640+ if you include the multiple names given to the same gods. Naturally many people now of the main 12 Olympian gods & goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite and Hestia. Dionysus and Demeter are also sometimes included. To ask which one is the most impressive to me is a great question but its so tremendously hard to answer because they are all impressive in their own individual areas - although Ares is possibly my least favourite as he was incredibly blood-thirsty, wrathful and also lustful \u2014 not a group of traits that you want to be around in my opinion =D. I do have 2 favourites that I love to study and they are Artemis and Hades, closely followed by Athena and Hephaestus has often intrigued me also in times gone by. Hermes as also often taken my interest in the past. Artemis: She\u2019s impressive to me through how strong-willed and mysterious she is; not falling into the same big-headed and lustful traps as the other gods. She fell in love only once with a man named Orion (sadly didn\u2019t end well) to which she never took another man again: this could be seen as loyal and faithful: some traits that the other deities lacked. Artemis was also incredibly skilled and was not disgusted by befriending humans and actually \u201ctrained\u201d those to be better instead of using the humans for her own gain. Although Artemis did act rash and have caused some pretty horrid deaths; these only seem deepened Artemis\u2019 character as her killings stemmed from the traumatic experience that caused her to become virgin and swear off men: making her actions less ridiculous (but not justified) than those of Athena or Hera who killed or cursed because they didn\u2019t like humans being better than them.Hades: He\u2019s such a misunderstood deity that different legends and authors show different aspects and traits which paint him in many lights: cruel and evil, sombre and respectful, quiet and lonely or stern and honourable; sometimes a mixture of all of them. Hades is possibly the one of the fewer gods who hasn\u2019t been wrote about in legend to have killed humans for the sake of killing them like the others \u2014 he had no need to as no human boasted about being better than him, they all feared him. HOWEVER: Hades did kidnap Persephone; which is like \u201ccome on\u2026way to soil your reputation\u201d but this action is often seen as a plight of loneliness and in the legends Hades didn\u2019t mistreat Persephone; he wanted to make her happy but just couldn\u2019t. This makes me see Hades as a more relatable deity to humans as he seems to go through the emotions that we do: Zeus never could fully understand pain, grief and sorrow because he had a grand old time but Hades was down with the souls of the damned and alone for his entire life \u2014 that takes a hardened individual to bear that.Hephaestus: The god that was seen as crippled and ugly yet he did many accomplishments that the gods and goddesses required in order to be their majestic selves. Hephaestus is impressive to me because although he wasn\u2019t what the Greeks saw as beauty: he didn\u2019t let this stop him from becoming probably the most active god on Olympus and used his skills to make some amazing things. He accepted the fact he was different and learned to cope with it and in time earned the respect of Zeus and the other gods & goddess from the skill he processed and not his appearance. (Aphrodite don\u2019t count because it seems only looks interested her).Athena: strong, wise, feminine and yet could hold her own against any man, Athena is very much what women do still look up to and have done since her creation. Athena literally represents the female human in traits and mind and everything else because there isn\u2019t a legend that goes by which Athena does not do something that a woman can relate to \u2014 minus the killing parts and curses - though her feelings and emotions that caused her to do that are often caused by the \u201cgreen-eyed monster\u201d that many women have experienced in their lives and as all females and males know: women are the best at throwing tantrums and getting their own way that cause irrational behaviour \u2014 I speak as a woman myself \u2014 but Athena also shows the other side of women: the caring side, the strong-willed side, the beauty and the intelligence wrapped up together, the need to protect those close to her and to always better herself whilst being reliable and mature minded \u2014 excluding her moments where her wrath came out.Hermes is definitely a god I\u2019d like to have round as a dinner guest; though I wouldn\u2019t trust his past history in stealing. ;) Hermes was the fun-loving youth on Olympus and had a great many skills to his name which meant Hermes I feel you\u2019d never be out of things to talk about and he\u2019d always make you laugh. He wasn\u2019t a god to hold things too seriously and from my memory at this present time I don\u2019t believe he killed anybody off his own back - mostly rescuing was his thing\u2026 and if he did kill somebody it may have been Zeus\u2019s command but I don\u2019t think that happened\u2026? The only flaw with Hermes was that I think he was seen as a bit of an arrogant individual who burst to show off his skills \u2014 that gets tiring after the first few hours \u2014 and of course his stealing ways which meant you had to hide the silver cutlery when he came round. =)As a little shout out to Hestia: she was the kindest of the Olympian gods and I feel that although she wasn\u2019t \u201cimpressive\u201d and hadn\u2019t done anything to hold in memory: Hestia fought to keep peace whenever she could and enjoyed family time and friendly meet-ups where people could act civilised and talk around the fireplace/heath. This takes some effort and gusto to do up on Olympus with them deities, and I feel she is quite the aspiring goddess. Sorry I gabbled on a bit there but I simply couldn\u2019t just pin-point one deity as I feel a good many of them have always interested me from a young age and have impressed me in various ways \u2014 but I hope I helped answer your question in some form or another =D ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately we only know so much about the extended Greek Pantheon. Don't get me wrong, we have a lot, but you have to remember that many of the records and details would have been lost even before Rome Christianised as minor (and perhaps major, we literally wouldn't know) gods fell out of popularity and common awareness. What precious little we have was preserved in the Arab world and, for example, may be biased against certain gods.  Like Hera. We understand she was widely worshiped as the protector of mothers, and had the power necessary to, among other things, defeat Artemis and raise an alliance between the hated rivals Poseidon and Athena (This to bring down Zeus, mind, a project which failed). Most of what I've seen of her paints her as a vengeful bitch. Understandable, with Zeus' antics, but nevertheless an annoyingly one-sided account of a goddess who would have had a wide and popular following. She is one example of a Goddess who we know enough about to be interesting (and to be my response for most impressive and compelling) but not enough to say that we might know everything or even most things about her.  We are not about to learn any more (I've not heard of any recent unearthed manuscripts), but I would expect, should we find an account biased in her favour instead of against her, we would be treated to a delightful story. The story of a queen among the gods, tied to a jealous tyrant, so powerless against him that she could only exact her justice from his bastards and hapless conquests. I can imagine stories of love, forgiveness, revenge, betrayal, kindness, statesmanship, and all manner of other ends, now lost, through negligence and belligerence. Ever heard about women being literally written out of history, their achievements credited to men? This would be one of the earliest cases you might hear of.  ",
