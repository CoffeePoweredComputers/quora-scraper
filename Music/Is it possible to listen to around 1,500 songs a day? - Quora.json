That give 16 hours. \u2026 960 minutes. 960 minutes / 1500 songs would be 38.4 seconds per song. Kinda short. So let\u2019s use the entire 24 hours that would give 57.6 seconds per song. Still short, even for pop songs. No you can not listen to 1,500 songs per day. Pop songs average about 3\u20131/2 minutes. In 24 hours you COULD listen to 1141 songs in a day if they were the average length of 3\u20131/2 minutes. ",
