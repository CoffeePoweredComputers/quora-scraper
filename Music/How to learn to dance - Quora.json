            "answer_text": "I danced competitively, many hours a week, for three years, and I maintain a certain base level by myself.  The best way is dance classes. Maybe your community center has some, your college, a local studio. Depending on your location many or few options may be available. Some places have specific adult classes. Flexibility can be an issue as your muscles and joints start to tighten up in your teen years as you go through puberty, and without stretching they get tight. You can still develop flexibility, just not as fast as a younger kid or something. 23 years is by no means old however, so it would be a very different story if you were 33. When first starting you don't want to overkill and risk injury or simply a pulled muscle that will prevent you from trying out this really great activity. There are youtube videos of classes; however, a teacher can look at your body and teach you proper positioning and alignment; until then, I don't recommend it because body awareness is a trained skill, and even for people with a natural ability in it they need an external, trained eye to correct things that either look bad or could lead to injury.  There are so many styles!  Ballet - there are different schools, like Ceccheti, Vaganova, Royal Academy, there's a french one I forget at the moment. Some places just teach ballet technique without adherence to each school's specific style. This really needs a class and teacher just because there is a set proper technique for how it is done. Many students feel it can be boring, but there is a beauty to it that sometimes goes unappreciated. It can be liberating to feel like you are a beautiful poised ballerina from Swan Lake. When you learn it you can allow yourself to flow into the movement and really appreciate the graceful elegance and beauty of this style Modern - this was a reaction to the strictness of balet. There are many, many different techniques, and most teachers I know of study one, or at most a couple, techniques. Graham, Limon,  and Ailey are a few examples. It is a lot freer in what is considered \"dance\" and forms a foundation for a lot of modern contemporary stage dance. It can be very fun, especially with improvisation, but you have to release yourself into the movement. One of my favorites.  Lyrical - technically it is dance that takes inspiration from the lyrics of songs, it arose as people shifted away from orchestral compositions into \"popular\" music. It has themes from modern, but to me seems to stretch it a little farther while also returning to some of the roots of classical ballet. It is similar to modern, and the distinction is blurry at best Contemporary - this is where definitions get thrown out the window. It is almost easier to define contemporary as what it isn't than what it is. As a general, it stems from the modern and lyrical tradition, and really pushes the boundaries of movement as an art form. However, there is contemporary jazz and other forms that obscure that a little. The most defining feature is a constant pushing of boundaries and exploration of movement. Entry level classes can be fun and not too difficult, but at the higher levels there are extreme physical demands of strength and flexibility placed on the dancer(s). Absolutely beautiful, but can be very difficult. The same is with all of the genres though.  Jazz - very fun, upbeat, and often to popular music! It is very different from classical styles, characterized by sharp, powerful movements and just an \"edgy\" feel rebelling from the classical style. There are some neat tricks you can learn, and having a teacher can help you make sure you are learning them right to avoid injury and look good. Hip Hop - Comes from a blend of different movement traditions, many stemming from African tribal dances. The different styles generally start in the streets of large cities and nowadays have really been picked up in mainstream American culture. There are so many different styles with different movement qualities, from very fluid, to very sharp, hard hitting, and all in between. B-boys and breakdancing are another cool style. It is so fun but if you aren't used to the movement style it can be very strange. A lot of it runs contrary to what you learn in ballet class. It is so fun though and I definitely recommend trying it at least once!  Traditional dance - this can vary in availability depending on where you are. So many cultures have there own traditional dances, and learning about them can be a really interesting expose into the cultural beliefs and practices of a peoples. African tribal dance is one of the most common, usually from the West African tradition. Africa is a massive continent, and dance styles contrast dramatically between North and South. Native american dances can be very interesting, although some people have difficulty appreciating them. They were generally very significant to the individual tribe, and you have to be careful to respect the culture and peoples. Powwows, if one is near you, can be a great way to not only experience native dance but also native life and culture as well. Belly dancing is really fun, and there's often really fun accessories to wear or dance with.  Latin dance is super fun, and I'm putting it separate because there are so many styles since the Americas have such diverse cultures. There is ballroom styles, salsa, merengue, tango, and then people also dance it at home and in social gatherings, like bachata, although it is usually very similar to the fancy ballroom styles. The music is bright, upbeat, and if you learn ballroom you can impress your partner ;) It is very great physical activity because it is fast. Often they use a lot of hip, and you can really learn to use your body and control it.  Ballroom also includes waltz, foxtrot, square-dancing, and so many other fun social dances. Very enjoyable, and doesn't require a high level of ability unless you plan to compete; otherwise, you can pick up the basics and just get to enjoying yourself right away!  This doesn't mean they aren't physically challenging though.  Most of all, don't let yourself be intimidated by people who have been dancing since they were literally a day old. You have the same right as anyone else to enjoy yourself and express yourself through the wonderful, magnificent art of dance. Learning technique is important, but don't forget to let yourself just have fun. Otherwise, why bother? I wish you the best of luck and I hope you find joy in this beautiful art form the way I have.

            "answer_text": "Take group classes. Do not start with private classes. You may meet someone to practice with. :) My preferred discovery method to take classes when I travel is to go to We are what we do | Meetup and search for a meetup in my desired dance style. Those are setup by teachers and work better than their usually pathetic own websites. Videos will not help you until you reach a high enough proficiency level for them to be useful. They are great for choreography, but you need to be at the point of dancing instinctively. I record videos after every class for review and they would not make sense unless I practiced the steps in class earlier. You will need a dance studio with mirrors on its walls. Your home mirror is not enough. One wall of mirrors is not always enough either. There is a huge difference. You need to see both the position of hands in front and the hand on the back. You need to see the exact footwork from both vantage points. There is a big difference if you step on heel or toe, for example. I am taking classes at a dance studio with insufficient mirrors on just one wall and just a few mirrors on a side wall and it requires far too much thinking compared to a room with more mirrors. I recently took an advanced workshop in a room with no mirrors. That was very difficult. It turns out I actually did it correctly, but I could only see that in my mirror room. I do not know your gender, but there are two parts to any Latin dance. The man leads and the woman follows. There are same-gender couples, but they are an exception. So, if you are a man, you will need to learn how to lead. You will not learn this without a partner because air cannot push back. You need to see the placement of hand on the follower\u2019s back and how the hand moves to make her understand what she needs to do. The follower needs to see exactly how to step back or how to step side ways and how to move her hands. Similarly, if you are a woman, you will need to learn how to follow. Air will not push and pull you. Doing multiple turns without a hand spinning you will be challenging. Ideally, practice with a partner who is better than you. It will be much easier. Two beginners will need to do more work, but it can also be a lot of fun. Not all beginner classes are created equal. There are true beginner classes and there are two-tier classes. If a new leader came to my \u201cbeginner\u201d class for bachata, he likely would not complete every step shown in the first 60 minutes if he has never been trained before. Followers likely will because we have experienced leaders who can ensure the follower does the right steps even if she does not fully comprehend how to do them right. Some teachers forget how hard it is to get started when they concentrate on mostly teaching advanced technique, which basically is the second hour that builds on the technique shown in the previous \u201cbeginner\u201d section. Although a dancer who is learning a new dance style can keep up with that class, an absolute beginner probably would not. It would be more accurately described as intermediate steps disguised as beginner steps and more intermediate steps after that. At another class, however, there was a clear distinction. I was taking an obviously beginner level class and then the level of difficulty jumped for the second class. Although I stayed to see if I could do the intermediate sequences, I could not keep up with the \u201cintermediate\u201d group. There were no pauses, no detailed step breakdown, and so on. It was a true intermediate/advanced class. I had insufficient mastery of basics of that dance and it was obvious. It was fun to watch! Many classes follow this two hour format. You can identify this by observing who shows up. If you see obviously experienced dancers in the beginning portion of your class, it is likely to be more of the case of intermediate steps disguised as beginner class. If you see entirely different group of people show up after the first class, you are probably going to see a much higher level of difficulty in that second class. Free classes taught in a nightclub break down to 15\u201320 minutes of beginner instruction and then a few more interesting steps for the next 40\u201390 minutes. However, for those interesting steps the instructor often will discard the notion it\u2019s a beginner class. Still, nightclub classes are fun because they are usually free and you can usually stay at the club once the club lights come on and you have someone to dance with. ;) The path to success relies on practice outside the class. I have a dance studio at my gym that I can use at any time, but most people are not so lucky. Practice footwork at home. Practice with a partner in a studio. Getting footwork right takes more time than learning upper body moves, at least for me, and it can be done by yourself. I recommend getting nice sports Bluetooth headphones. My JBL Reflect BT Mini are amazing. They look like this:  Cheap corded headphones will frustrate you. These stay glued in your ears and have an 8-hour battery. Fry\u2019s sells them refurbished for $29.99. :) In summary, take classes and do not worry about your inexperience. The other students will want to help you. ",
