            "answer_text": "Legally can be a tricky term. 8 D I\u2019m no lawyer, I should be clear about that, but it seems to me you need to ask yourself three questions. A) Will anyone even notice? I mean, you\u2019re not planning on selling the album\u2026 and even if you were, do you think it would sell enough that Adam Levine or Billie Eilish (or whoever\u2026 Costi or Maxim Fadeev\u2026 I don\u2019t know where you live) would even notice? B) Will anyone even care? I mean, sure\u2026 if BTS stole a song from EXO, that would be a big deal. But if you just want to pay tribute to an artist you love and don\u2019t make any money off it, what\u2019s the harm? That\u2019s why few (if any) major artists care when people remix their songs for Youtube. It\u2019s free publicity and doesn\u2019t take anything away from their actual sales. Unless you think more people will want to listen to your version of WAP than the official version. That\u2019s also (I imagine) how most bands get away with performing cover songs in concerts. It\u2019s simply not worth the effort to try to keep track of every band who ends their set with Kick Out the Jams, determine what portion of the ticket sales could be regarded as profit from that one song, try to collect the money\u2026 it would cost more in lawyer fees than it\u2019s worth. C) What\u2019s the worst that will happen? Suppose Arijit Singh did notice that you covered one of his songs on your album and suppose he took it as a personal affront. What can he do? His lawyer will send you a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter and ask for fair recompense for usage, based on your sales. (This is the part where \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer\u201d is relevant.) If your album has no sales, his client will be due exactly X% of zero dollars. The worst that can happen is that you have to stop using that song on future editions of the album and not give away any more copies. I suppose there is a 4th question you could ask. Do you really care if it is legal or not? Because technically, it might be \u201cillegal\u201d but if no one cares, why should you? No harm, no foul. I happen to come from a family of artists\u2026 two musicians, two authors\u2026 and we\u2019ve long since learned not to stress over this stuff unless it\u2019s on a serious platform and we\u2019re using a known name, or if we expect to make money off the endeavor. But even if you do expect to make a little money, do you really think Lady Gaga is going to get pissy over what small sales you might expect to have, considering how much money she has? Unless you\u2019re a well know industry artist (in which case you wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask this question) I think it\u2019s a fair bet to assume you\u2019re below Lady Gaga\u2019s radar. 8 ) Peace be with you, my friend!

            "answer_text": "Maybe. Telling us what you don\u2019t plan to do with it does not tell us what you do plan to do with it. If you plan to distribute it to the public or perform it in public, then you are required to pay the legal royalty, even if you are not making any money off it yourself. If, say, you intend to record the album and only play it at your own house, for small numbers of guests, then sure. Or if you\u2019re only going to play it at licensed venues, where the venue would be required to pay the royalties. If, though, you intend to let people download it, then you have to pay the royalty to be legal. ",
