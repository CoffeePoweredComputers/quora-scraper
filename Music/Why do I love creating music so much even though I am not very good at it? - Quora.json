Maybe it\u2019s not good overall, but hearing that improvement, and hearing yourself create something that\u2026 kinda sounded a little bit decent\u2026 Is compelling. So you keep doing it, and keep improving, and keep fuelling the passion, and then eventually you will love it AND be happy with what you create. Seriously keep at it. It\u2019s a great passion to have. Now at 31 I really feel like I\u2019m starting to zero in on some really great writing. It\u2019s a satisfying, though often tedious and frustrating hobby\u2026 But so damn satisfying\u2026  Here\u2019s a song I wrote a few years back that I was always very happy with ",

            "answer_text": "Creating music can be very theraputic and there\u2019s the satisfaction of producing something. As for not being very good at it, the more time you spend creating music, the more your skills will develop. Also, what is \u201cgood\u201d is partly subjective and it\u2019s easy to be overly criticial of our own work (I listen back to stuff I recorded years ago and cringe at some of it!) and also compare ourselves to others. If you enjoy creating music and others enjoy listening to your efforts, then that is good! :) ",
