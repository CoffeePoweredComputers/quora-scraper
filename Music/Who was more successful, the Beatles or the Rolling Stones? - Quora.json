            "answer_text": "Financially? Hard to say since the Stones are still performing to sold out stadiums and making records. In this regard they have a fifty year advantage. Although the Beatles have never left the sales charts, ever. Add the fab fours independent activities (especially Sir Paul) and it might be close. A little google research may addd clarity. Music and influence? There is absolutely no doubt the Beatles reign supreme over the entire world of modern music. I was nine years old when they \u201cinvaded\u201d the US and it rocked my young life. Everything changed overnight. Rock and roll was everywhere for the next ten years and of course, well beyond. The thing about the Beatles was somehow they were always a step ahead of the rest. From the beginning to the end, every new record was surprising in its freshness, newness and yes, sometimes confusing. But, I can almost assure you that every song on every new LP was quickly adopted and adored by all who were born within 10- 20 years of me. As for the Stones. They were also sensational and I loved (and own) everything they have ever recorded. Someone earlier referred to them as the bad boys of the era. Spot on. Just look at their early album covers and you will understand. But, I believe, they, more than any other major act Introduced the blues to white American audiences. That in itself changed the way we all began listening to a much broader scope of music. Racial barriers began falling on top 40 channels. In the 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s pop music stations were pretty much divided between black, white and country (don\u2019t forget easy listening). That all changed almost overnight and I attribute some of that change to a number of English invasion groups who coveted and covered American R&B. English teens at the time would almost wait at the docks for the latest (mostly black) shipment of US R&B records. The Stones were at the vanguard of this movement. Check the majority of their songs on their first several records. But, what allowed their ongoing success? They evolved. Never really leaving their roots they continued to grow and put out new and surprising music. of course I would be insanely remiss if I left Elvis and the whole Sun Records/Memphis sound out of this conversation. Finally, if we are going to look at influence and success from that era, one would be foolish to leave Bob Dylan off the list. Bob has been influencing and inspiring popular music for more than fifty years. How has he succeeded? He is in that rare group that never stopped evolving. I don\u2019t know how he Financially stacks up against the Beatles or Stones over the years but I do know he has been on (Sold out)tours for at least 45years, he has had dozens of highly acclaimed, best selling records and, check the charts today, his newest record scheduled for release in two weeks is already an amazon best seller! The short answer: in my humble opinion, the Beatles were, and always will be, the most successful popular music act in history. Dylan and the Stones will forever be incredibly successful and influential. ",

            "answer_text": "Tough question to answer. Anyone who is a music fan will give you a different answer to this question. Here's my answer to this question. From what I have read and seen over the years the Rolling Stones were always viewed as the bad boys of rock and roll. As such they weren't able to get on such popular American TV shows such as Ed Sullivan. They played venues such as the Cow Palace in California. Not to take anything away from them musically, they came on the scene after the Beatles had started to become famous so they had a harder time breaking into the business. The Beatles on the other hand came across as clean cut British lads to which most music fans could relate. You also had Beatlemania which took the world by storm. At most of their live shows it was difficult to hear them play over the screaming of the female fans. They were also innovators as they were developing new sounds and techniques which were used on Sgt Pepper and The White Album. This debate has been going on for years, but in this writer's opinion I think The Beatles have a slight edge. They decided to call it quits at the height of their careers and their music is still relevant to this day. A lot of musicians site The Beatles as the influence that made them pick up an instrument.
