            "answer_text": "The human element is the important consideration here. Why have professions of every kind through the ages adopted their own clothing, jargon, and secret handshakes? Because we are a social species, and are most at home in a social group with our own niche. The hat in this case is a social marker, a status symbol in the most general sense. As to magical advantages, there are no conventional ones. The hat has, to my knowledge, never been regarded as a magical tool that would enable the wearer to access and channel, focus, or otherwise use his power. But having said that, some unconventional magical advantages readily suggest themselves. Wizards frequently augment their own energy with material objects - animal parts, plants and plant parts, stones and crystals, and so on - that they feel possess an energy that blends with or augments their own. The hat could be used as a holder for magical objects intended to increase the wizard's power and competence. For example, if the wizard wanted an increased ability to ward off negative energy (or if you like an alternate terminology, 'evil spirits'), he could sew various things into the lining or attach them to the brim, for example a protective herb such as sweetgrass or garlic; a protective stone such as obsidian, jasper, or amethyst; and so on. If he were on a mission to promote love and harmony, he would choose a different set of adjuncts. None of these need be carried in the hat, but since one is wearing the hat anyway, a discerning wizard might well slip a cluster of mugwort leaves, down feathers from a totem bird, or a handful of rose petals up into that lirlpipe! Since non-magical folk would never think of such a thing, he would thus have one or two secrets above the brim as well as under. That to the side, I would say there's no functional or necessary reason for a wizard to wear a hat of any kind. But the same goes of a lawyer's suit, a doctor's white coat, a cowboy's hat, or a sheriff's star. The human side, as I said at the top, makes all of us - even wizards - do things that strict practicality does not require. Put it down to the human element.    ",

            "answer_text": "The variety of kinds of hats that people used to wear is really extraordinary. They were necessary in cold countries before the umbrella was invented, but they also served as a kind of social identification. I think the wizard's hat may be a variant of the witch's hat. Here's a history of witches' hats: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/10/17/the_history_of_the_witch_s_hat_origins_of_its_pointy_design.html Pointy hats are rather inconvenient, but sometimes it's worth it. Here is the turban worn by Akali Sikhs. The metal objects are sharpened quoits to be thrown in battle.    \u200b ",
