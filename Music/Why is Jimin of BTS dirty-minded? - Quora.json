            "answer_text": "Tbh at least more then half of the Army's think that Jiminie is totally \u201cDirty Minded\u201d but from his perspective I can disagree with you :) he might seem but he's not\u2026  He's out there existing, making everyone happy and just in general being a cute lil Bean and making everyone soft.. But wait till you piss him off :D:)  Jimin gets involved with a lot of dirty stuff but I can tell he's not like that at all.. Yea he can slip Som joke here and there but that's about it..     Also if you watch some videos sometimes it seems like it slips out of his mouth accidentally :D but remember that he's still in the entertainment industry and can definitely act certain way\u2026. (believe me they all know what Crazy Army's want to see or hear and they don't mind to say or do so\u2026)   Also he said that the older hyungs are very dirty minded (THOSE BIGGEST ONES BEING RM AND JIN) *instant betrayal* XD :D but I never actually thought that Jin was the one who's the most dirtiest according to Chim :D so imagine living like that for 7 years? You'll definitely be dirty :D or other members will make you look that way :D believe me I know how it is\u2026  I love Jiminies attitude, he will kick your ass for good if you will try to make him dirty or make stupid jokes about him being short :D if you wonder then yes\u2026  Jimin Definitely is THAT friend.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s just go over this\u2026 Jimin is a 23-year-old man. Not a 5-year-old boy. Everyone has hormones. Most people\u2019s hormones increase their desire for sex at some point in their lives, with the exception of asexual people, in which I highly doubt any of BTS are asexual. Jimin is dirty-minded because of his hormones. Some people don\u2019t let the hormones take over the cleanness of their minds, Jimin wasn\u2019t one of those people. Jimin is someone I would say has an increased desire for sex. Not saying it\u2019s unhealthy or bad, because, it\u2019s not. I mean, just watch his reaction to Normani. Do you see how he acts when he finds someone attractive? He\u2019s a horny guy, it\u2019s only natural he\u2019d be dirty-minded. ",
