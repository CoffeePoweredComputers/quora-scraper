            "answer_text": "When you say \u201cBritish\u201d, do you mean Cockney? Glaswegian? Liverpudlian? Cardiff? Cornish? Britain has hundreds of regional accents, there is no reason to think that the USA would pick any one of them. Of course, when you say \u201cBritish\u201d you may mean \u201cgeneric posh South of England\u201d accent, and again, there is no reason why they\u2019d adopt that either. I used to live in Wales, 10 miles from England, and the accent was distinctly different in two towns 10 miles apart. There is no such thing as the British accent, it\u2019s hundreds of different accents, some of them barely understandable to someone not familiar with the accent. If accents can be different 10 miles away, they can sure as hell be different thousands of miles away. ",

            "answer_text": "The UK has many accents; the US fewer, but in part the latter\u2019s changes pre-date the dropping of \u201cr\u201d by upperclass Brits in the 1800s. Scholars have a hard time figuring out what people sounded like pre-recordings since spelling (which used to be more idiosyncratic) sometimes indicated what people sounded like but not always. Comments in letters and newspapers about accents heard are not consistent. In addition black people influenced Southern English and the region of the UK could influence whether New Englanders, Mid Atlantic and Southerners sounded different. Scandinavians influenced Minnesota. There is no one reason but many. Analysis of what Shakespeare sounded like shows the US and Ireland are closer to what English used to sound like, i.e. the RP of the uppercrust in London changed more than American accents have. ",
