            "answer_text": "There are minor sound differences in every decision the manufacturer makes about pickups. If you remove the covers, they also change the sound in a minor way. Back in the 1970s, it was hard to get enough signal to overdrive an amplifier sufficiently to get the sound that you really wanted. Everything that a manufacturer could do to give a little bit more was worth trying, and everything that a musician could do to get a little bit more out of their gear was worth trying it. I actually have semi-covered humbuckers on my 1977 Yamaha SG-1000. This was one of the many innovations that Yamaha built into their \u2018Santana\u2019 guitars. It enabled them to retain clean sound on the split-coil option with low noise. These days, amplifiers feature far more powerful tone controls (the controls on my Marshall Master/Volume head from the same year did very little), and everyone has got access for little cost to hugely powerful multi-fx pedals. The upshot is: covered, uncovered, semi-covered, it just gives a very slightly different starting place for achieving your own sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the material of the cover. If it\u2019s a metal cover it does roll off a small amount of high end. It can be a good as well as bad trait. If the humbucker has harsh ice-picky highs then a metal cover does help to roll off those harsh highs to some extent, however if a humbucker is already low on highs the metal cover can make it sound muddy. However if it\u2019s a plastic cover it has no impact on the tone, but it does protect your pickups from gunk. The thing about uncovered pickups is that they\u2019re always exposed to dust, smoke, sweat, and moisture. If you like your pickups to be clean then going for a pickup with a plastic cover is indeed a good idea. Then again although I prefer to keep my guitar clean but honestly I\u2019ve never cared about getting covered pickups. The pickups on my guitar are direct mounted, I just use canned air to blow off any dust or gunk accumulated on the pickups after playing my guitar. It keeps them clean. ",

            "answer_text": "I removed the covers from my Les Paul because I wanted to replace them with cool plastic ones. For the record, they looked awesome. How did the sound change? Made them brighter, more open, much noisier and didn\u2019t sound like Gibson pickups anymore. Turns out, the sound of the cover is a large component of the sound of the pickup. Makes sense, actually. Soldered the covers back on later that day. If you want that slightly rawer, less covered sound, buy a set of DiMarzios. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience if you use the same pickup with and without a cover with it you do get a bit of shielding although humbuckers aren\u2019t particularly noisy pickups anyway but it seems to my ears cut a very small amount of high end which depending on the pickup/guitar isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Of course you get a totally different look and I guess the cover does offer a bit of protection but I\u2019ve seen a ton of uncovered humbuckers that lived on the road and In smoky clubs for years with no problems.
