            "answer_text": "There is. In fact, there are two kinds:  That\u2019s pretty much an electric bass grafted on to an enlarged acoustic guitar body. They don\u2019t work all that wonderfully well, which is why you don\u2019t see them very much. That particular model (Warwick Alien) is about as good as they get. The reason is that there simply isn\u2019t enough air in that body. This is the instrument that inspired the electric bass:  The double bass doesn\u2019t have enough air volume either, but it\u2019s a lot closer, and you can\u2019t make it bigger without making it unplayable. The electric bass was invented because no matter how hard you try, you are not going to match a drum kit in volume with any acoustic string instrument. But you can, with five or more double bass players, get up to balancing a symphony orchestra\u2019s brass section. An acoustic bass guitar doesn\u2019t even match an ordinary acoustic guitar. They rather suck. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you familiar with symphonic music in the Western tradition? Composers like Beethoven, Bach, Mozart wrote in this vein. Almost all the most famous classical music composers composed symphonies and this was before electricity so at night they had to use candles or lamps with oil! It was way back before air conditioning and everything. Well, if they didn\u2019t have an electric circuit to create a sound I guess they had to make a sound somehow! So you know what they did? They made acoustic instruments that amplified vibrations. Like trumpets and oboes and stuff. Some of these acoustic instruments were stringed instruments like maybe you\u2019ve heard of a violin? Well, there\u2019s a great big huge violin that stands on the floor and it\u2019s so big it makes very low tones. Guess what it is. An acoustic bass! Have you ever seen a jazz band? They have them. I could\u2019ve just said \u201cyes\u201d but then I\u2019d be collapsed and you wanted an answer! ",
