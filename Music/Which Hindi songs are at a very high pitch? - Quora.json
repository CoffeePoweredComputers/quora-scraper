            "answer_text": "Actually, your question contradicts with the answers you\u2019ll get here. High pitched songs are not easy to sing. Speaking or singing loudly doesn\u2019t mean you have a high pitch. Still let me answer you question. Most of the songs that you instantly fall in love with are high pitched songs. This is the reason why people love Arijit\u2019s songs so much. 90% of his songs are high pitched. So if you want to sing high pitched songs, take any of Arijit Singh\u2019s song. KK\u2019s songs are high pitched too and more difficult to sing. Some of the songs that I would suggest other than that are Hamari Adhuri Kahan (Title Track)Tu Hi Re (Bombay)Raabta (Agent Vinod)Pehli Dafa (Atif Aslam)Saware (Phantom)Bulleya (Ae Dil Hai Mushkil)Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Ae Dil Hai Mushkil)Jiyen Kyu (Dum Maaro Dum)Auliya (Ungli)Zindagi Do Pal Ki (Kites)Tune Jo Na Kaha (New York)Abhi Abhi (Jism 2)Tum Ho Toh (Rock On)Tu Jaane Na (Ajab Prem Ki Gazab Kahani)O sanam (Lucky AliThank you.
