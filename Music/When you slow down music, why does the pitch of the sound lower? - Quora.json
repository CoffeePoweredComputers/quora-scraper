            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s slowed down by simple mechanical means like reducing tape speed or slowing a turntable, everything becomes spaced out. Notes that were one second apart are now - if the speed was halved - two seconds apart. This carries right down to the individual vibrations that define the pitch of the note - a note that hit your ears 440 times per second now does so 220 times, a drop of one octave. We have technology now that combines speed change with pitch shift, allowing a slow down that retains original pitch. It can sound pretty good for small shifts. Not so good - depending on the musical content - for larger ones. ",
