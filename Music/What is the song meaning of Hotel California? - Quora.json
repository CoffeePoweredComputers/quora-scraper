            "answer_text": "Well, The Eagles do have a reputation of writing ambiguous lyrics. Most notably in Desperado and this song. And thanks to it being their most popular song, it is quite unsurprising that there are so many interpretations. But people do consider this song to be a generally happy song. It does have some wonderful guitar solos. But I'd like to think that it is about the destructive nature of rock n' roll lifestyle and the artists' self-destructive streak. I know what you are thinking. \u201cHotel California and destructive? Such awesome guitar solo man! What shit have you been smoking, bro?\u201d But hear me out. Not everything is happy. And not everything is the way we see it. There are always those lines which can be interpreted in many different ways. Who\u2019s to say my version isn\u2019t true? (The conspiracy theorist in me will be proud)  For example, just look at \u2018Stairway To Heaven\u2019. Play it backwards and boom \u2013 It\u2019s a shout out to Satan. (Band denies it) Not that this song has anything to do with Satan. Maybe it does. I\u2019d like to stay away from that version though.  Alright, let\u2019s break this down. On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hairWarm smell of colitas, rising up through the air Pretty straight forward stuff here. Oh, Colitas is a Spanish slang for weed \u2013 roughly translates to \u2018little tails/buds\u2019 Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering lightMy head grew heavy and my sight grew dimI had to stop for the night This is the first sign that something is not right. He didn\u2019t really want to stop but was too tired. Or out of his mind doing drugs. Or he was running low on drugs. There she stood in the doorway;I heard the mission bellAnd I was thinking to myself,\"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell\" Well obviously the Satan connection is pretty clear here. Ignore it. Mission Bell has a nice little significance too. California was filled with Roman Catholic missionaries from Spain who built a lot of churches along the West Coast. These churches were called missions. So basically, the mission bell is rung to inform the church-goers that it is prayer time. He is saying this idea may end up being both good and bad. Also worthy to note is the general frame of mind most rock n roll artists have about the music industry.  The music industry can often feel like both heaven and hell. Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the wayThere were voices down the corridorI thought I heard them say... Welcome to the Hotel CaliforniaSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)Such a lovely facePlenty of room at the Hotel CaliforniaAny time of year (Any time of year)You can find it here I might be going a step too far for saying this but I like to think that 'candle' is some sort of drug. \u201cShe showed me the way\u201d would then mean that this girl is leading him into the life of drugs. It can also mean that he is enjoying the luxuries of the rockstar lifestyle (since the overarching theme of the song is about the self-destructive nature of the rock n roll artists). He thinks that this is all he needs - he's happy (such a lovely place/face) and he knows he can find this happiness quite easily 'Any time of year'. Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bendsShe got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friendsHow they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.Some dance to remember, some dance to forget Again, clearly, obsessed with this girl. Google tells me \u2018Tiffany-twisted\u2019 refers to a popular chain of Jewelry store called Tiffany\u2019s. The first 3 lines only serve to remind us that the singer is enchanted with this girl and the idea of California. The last line says something else though. Something about the dance or her expressions or just his fatigue reminded him of the time he danced to forget. We can only speculate. But since I\u2019ve been doing quite a lot of that at the moment, here\u2019s one more. He\u2019s heart-broken. But that line is still pretty open ended. We can always speculate that dancing part can be translated into any other forms of art - like music. And he's writing the song to either remember or forget about his tragedy. So I called up the Captain,\"Please bring me my wine\"He said, \"We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine\" As he\u2019s reminded of his lost love, he wants to drink and forget his sorrows. But since this hotel doesn't serve his favourite wine, he is forced to use something else (drugs, pills, other alcohols?) so he can sleep peacefully.  And still those voices are calling from far away,Wake you up in the middle of the nightJust to hear them say... Nightmares about his lost love wake him up and he tries to fill his head with happy thoughts again. Welcome to the Hotel CaliforniaSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)Such a lovely faceThey livin' it up at the Hotel CaliforniaWhat a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)Bring your alibis \u2018They livin\u2019 it up at the Hotel California\u2019 is obviously said in a sarcastic tone. The singer\u2019s illusion that this place can make him happy is shattered. Here\u2019s the first real instance he actually gives it away. \u2018What a nice surprise, bring your alibis\u2019 The singer tells his listeners to stay in a place like this \u2013 especially when you are living the extravagant rock and roll lifestyle \u2013 you lose your own real self. So you fake it. Have an alibi. The real you is a lonely and miserable drug addict trying to make sense of life. But you just cannot let everyone know that. I\u2019m speculating (again) that at this point, he used whatever he was high on again and went for dinner. Mirrors on the ceiling,The pink champagne on iceAnd she said \"We are all just prisoners here, of our own device\" As our unstable singer sits down for a meal, the girl he\u2019s enchanted with also agrees with him. How we are stuck in the same old rut, how we are just getting on with our meaningless lives. This comes as a surprise considering how the singer described the girl as in the previous verse - someone who is pampered and doesn\u2019t compromise on living the Californian dream. Again, I\u2019d like to speculate that our singer was maybe hallucinating and just assumed she said it. But it doesn\u2019t matter, really. She could\u2019ve said it. People tend to get bored of life, sooner or later. Moving on.. And in the master's chambers,They gathered for the feastThey stab it with their steely knives,But they just can't kill the beast While this whole verse shouts of Satanism (what with the master and beast references), I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. And Google agrees. Apparently \u2018steely knives\u2019 is a reference to fellow musician Steely Dan \u2013 who previously referenced this band in one of his songs. They metaphorically are killing Steely Dan - which they were partly successful in doing. This song gave them international status while Steely Dan was not very popular outside the USA. Last thing I remember, I wasRunning for the doorI had to find the passage backTo the place I was before He was starting to see how this place will not help him forget at all. If anything, it was forcefully reminding him of his past again and again. He\u2019s trying to find the passage back to his real self so he can get on with his real life.  \"Relax, \" said the night man,\"We are programmed to receive. The next line is the most ambiguous of them all - and my favourite too. We have all been there before. Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve been there. The nightman is the side of him that wants to stay and continue partying. We are brought up and conditioned by society to be receptive to messages about status and wealth. To put a different spin on it, the human psyche is programmed to enjoy receiving more than giving, it\u2019s only natural for people to surrender to their desires. In which case, receiving would refer to abusing drugs and partying in general - synonymous with rock n roll culture. You can check-out any time you like,But you can never leave!  The singer is totally shattered now and sees the fallacy of all this. He realizes he is stuck in a vicious cycle. He can leave the hotel and go back to normal life seemingly unharmed \u2014 but it\u2019s still got a hold on you and always will. This is a clear reference to the glamorous lifestyle and the drug addiction of rockstars. So there, no Satan involved. Thanks for the A2A. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The Hotel California was the State hospital outside of Camarillo, CA. Back in the earlier years of Hollywood, if a star or other Hollywood 'big name' went off the deep end because of 'overwork' or 'depression' or whatever, they would often be taken to the hospital at Camarillo. One could never, ever say that some Hollywood big shot was in the mental hospital, so publicly, they would be 'vacationing at the Hotel California'. the poem is about a man who was taken there, and once he realized where he was, he wanted out. But, as they say, 'You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.' It actually is on a desert road, and you can smell the colitis in the air. And 'fer sher, once you checked in, you could not leave. There were actual insane people there, with very,very hard and difficult problems; not just the Hollywood stars. There were the criminally insane, and those who just could not handle life, period. The place is much more than just the one building; there are several buildings, and I'm sure when it was open, people DID dance in the moonlight there. ---'Some danced to remember, some danced to forget'. There was one building that was nothing but padded cells, and it was not rare at all to find people in straight jackets at the hospital, either for their own protection, or for the protection of the staff. And I'm sure some of the rather rich delirious visitors DID call up the front desk and ask for room service (So, I called up the captain, 'please bring me my wine'...) And, no doubt, some were woken up in the middle of the night just to take their meds on schedule. And that part about 'stabbing with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast' is no doubt about an incident at a typical meal gathering in the big building when some patient just started to stab his meal, 'but he just can't kill the beast.' Every word of the song tells of different situations at that hospital. ---Rich people, poor people, some who just could no longer deal with life, some who were very, very dangerous, and some who were there simply because they had epilepsy, and no drug was working for them. Many, many Hollywood people spent time in there. It is still there, just a few miles south of the city of Camarillo, home of a LOT of Hollywood stars, producers, writers, and other film legends. The hospital has been closed for years, and there was often talk about tearing it down because of all the bad memories in the place, but instead, it became the University of California, Channel Islands. The buildings look just like the buildings on the album cover. ",
