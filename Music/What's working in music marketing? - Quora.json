The less focused you become on trying to force feed your music to people willing to take a look at you, and the more focused you become about trying to actually create a genuine and long lasting relationship, the better off you will be!  Besides that, fans want to be empowered. Instead of just asking them to share your music or expect them to do this or that, give your committed fans the tools needed to actually grow your fan base for you and become an integral (and appreciated) part of what makes you a success.
