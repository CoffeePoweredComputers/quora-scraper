            "answer_text": "Every persons answer to the question will be different. It all depends on needs and wants. Roland will use its experience in the market to set a price point where it thinks it can maximise its profit - ie enough people will believe it worth the amount and want to buy it v the lower the price the less profit they will make. So the only thing that matters is - is it worth it for you. ",
