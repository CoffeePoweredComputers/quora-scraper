            "answer_text": "The band as a whole did not feel connected to it. I also believe Frusciante never even listened to One Hot Minute. The only song they played live while Frusciante was with the band was Flea\u2019s \u201cPea\u201d. Along with the fact that they did not feel connected to \u201cOne Hot Minute\u201d, I believe there was an unspoken or spoken agreement with Frusciante that they would not play any songs on that album. They have played many Slovak era songs live with Frusciante because he loved and grew up listening to RHCP. Presently, Josh has a fresh take on the album. Here is a recent quote from Flea and Chad: \u201cOn the road, Klinghoffer has encouraged the band to acknowledge long-forgotten corners of its catalog, including the 1995 funky pop hit \u201cAeroplane,\u201d from its lone LP with Dave Navarro on guitar. \u201cWe also worked up \u2018My Friends\u2019 from that bastard album,\u201d says Smith. \u201cJohn [Frusciante] just never felt connected to that record. Josh is like, \u2018I don\u2019t care, man. I like it.'\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "My guess is that they're unhappy with the album among other things. It was produced during a time of turmoil in the band. John Frusciante left the band on hiatus and they brought in Dave Navarro as a replacement. Coming from Jane's addiction with a heavier, distorted sound changed the tone of One Hot Minute. While the album was commercially successful, critics and fans didn't receive it as well. Navarro also relapsed into heroine and was eventually fired over creative differences. But due to Anthony and Flea's desire to stay clean I'm sure his drug use didn't help. After winning his battle with heroine addiction, Frusciante rejoined the band and stayed with them until after Stadium Arcadium. So ultimately a mix of RHCP disliking the album, Frusciante's unwillingness to play the part on these songs, and perhaps even an attempt to walk away from that period of time, the band doesn't play those songs live anymore.
