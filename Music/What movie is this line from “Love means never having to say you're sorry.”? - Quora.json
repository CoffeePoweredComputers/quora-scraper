            "answer_text": "It\u2019s from two movies, actually. It was made famous in Arthur Hiller\u2019s Love Story (1970), in which Jenny (Ali McGraw) says it to Oliver (Ryan O\u2019Neal) and Oliver later quotes it to his father (Ray Milland). But . . . It gets a reprise in the very last scene of What\u2019s Up, Doc? (1972), Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s love letter to the screwball comedies of the 1930s and specifically to Bringing Up Baby (1938). Howard (Ryan O\u2019Neal, again) is telling Judy (Barbra Streisand) \u2014 who he\u2019s fallen utterly and hopelessly in love with, even as she\u2019s reduced his life to a complete shambles \u2014 that he\u2019s sorry for losing his temper with her in an earlier scene. \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d Judy replies. \u201cLove means never having to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d She looks at him with her enormous blue-gray eyes and her thousand-watt smile, and bats her eyelashes theatrically. He looks back at her, completely smitten. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard,\u201d he says softly, and she nods enthusiastically, as if to say: \u201cI know, right?\u201d They smile at each other a moment longer . . . kiss . . . and the camera pans away as they begin Happily Ever After.

            "answer_text": "Hi Derek, you asked which movie \"Love means never having to say you're sorry\" comes from? I remember as a teen this was the catchphrase on movie posters in a lot of girls rooms\u2026.the movie was 1970's \"Love Story\" with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. I've got to. think that if one does a search just using that phrase, \"Love Story\" will pop up although I haven't actually checked to be sure. Just to be clear the idea is just ridiculous\u2026I wouldn't advise trying to be in any relationship with out knowing how to be or say you're sorry when you've screwed up or when your partner is hurt and/or in pain.
