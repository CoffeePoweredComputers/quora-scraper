            "answer_text": "For me I would say BBIBBI by IU I will put some of the lyrics down below and why they relate to me Beyond this line, it\u2019s an invasion Beep(Oh Oh) This is before everything happens, before they invade my privacy, before they annoy me, before they cross the line in general. I am warning them about it and if they don\u2019t listen they will get a mental Yellow Card. Back Off Back Off As a introvert who doesn\u2019t like many crowds and people I want everyone to back off and just stay a certain distance. In my school most people are very childish, silly and are manly all extroverted and they like to \u2018playfully hit\u2019 each other, yes that includes handshakes, high fives and fist bumps. Even though it doesn\u2019t hurt I still hate it when people touch me, so I just want them to back off. Yellow C.A.R.D This is sort of like Back Off Back Off but like what happens after if they don\u2019t go away. If they don\u2019t go away I mentally give them a Yellow Card/Warning that if they do something else wrong or do it again then I will acquaintance them(Thats my line don\u2019t steal it) Why do you like clothes like that? I care about my self image and even though nobody says it out loud, I feel as though they are judging me by my looks/clothes. \u201cWhy do you wear clothes like that,\u201d is what they are thinking about me. Hello Stupi I.D They are stupid for doing this, they have crossed the line and since they have already gotten a few yellow cards already I give them a red card. They are out, they aren\u2019t my friend anymore they are just my acquaintance. I won\u2019t hang out with them as much and find new friends that won\u2019t make the same mistake again. It\u2019s too late for them to turn back now, just like at the end of the MV the curtains turn from yellow to red. Sometimes if this happens to you will takes a few years, mine took 6 years. My friendship just ended for me a few days ago. She said, \u201cYou(Not me) are skinny, I am skinny, but you(me) are\u2026ehhh. Well at least I didn\u2019t call you fat.\u201d I am not considering her as my best friend anymore but I am still pretending to be her best friend because then I would have to give her up to my enemy. Listen to BBIBBI by IU it\u2019s a great song in my opinion and you should check it out ",
