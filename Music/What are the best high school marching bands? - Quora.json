Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are other amazing high school bands in California and Florida, but around Texas and Oklahoma those are the really good ones. Puts my 5A ragtag band to shame. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not much into bands anymore but many years ago I was a member of a drum and bugle corp. I think their talent in competitions far outweighs any marching band hands down. That said, any band that does the big parades would be right up there. Rose Bowl, Macy\u2019s, etc. That is not to say that there are not great marching bands at many local high schools, because there are some fantastic ones. ",
