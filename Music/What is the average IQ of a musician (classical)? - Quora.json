            "answer_text": "Depends on who you ask. If you ask ten classical musicians, you\u2019ll get a dozen different answers. But the patterns are consistent, with one exception we\u2019ll come to in a minute. Generally, musicians will tell you that people who play the same type of instrument they do are all geniuses. Then the list goes downhill from there. Usually the second tier is instruments of a similar group, (strings, woodwinds, etc.). After that it varies, but near the bottom of the list are vocalists or percussionists, for some reason. Unless you ask a vocalist or percussionist. But at the absolute bottom\u2014and this is sole point of agreement\u2014are conductors. Now we come to the exception, which as you\u2019ve probably figured out already, is conductors. They\u2019ll tell you that all musicians, of any type, are dumber than a bag of used kitty litter. And that includes conductors. Except themselves, of course. ",
