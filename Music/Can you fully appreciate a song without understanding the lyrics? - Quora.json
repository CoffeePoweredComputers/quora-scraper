            "answer_text": "Depends. I\u2019m really into lyrical interpretation and putting a story or discovering the story to lyrics, but usually, yes. I can make up my own narrative for the words, or apply it to one of my stories (eg: Out of Time by Skogsr\u00e5 or Waves Break by Sam Padrul and Megan Vice \u2026I have ABSOLUTELY no idea what either of these songs are truly about, but both are relevant to my characters and I love the sound so I can appreciate them without trouble). If I like the sound of a certain song, BUT I can tell/suspect that the words are about something inappropriate or destructive, then I don\u2019t want to put that in my ears, even if I can\u2019t totally understand\u2026that\u2019s an exception.. Of course, there are also songs that I don\u2019t fully understand, and suspect are about something specific (that I might not actually like/support), but I still listen to the song because I enjoy the artist or the sound so much (eg: Skydiving by Lights. I\u2019m like 80% sure this song is about sex but coupled with the video and comic, it\u2019s honestly hard to tell\u2026at the same time I sorta just don\u2019t care cause I love Lights so much :P). For the most part, it\u2019s about the aesthetic and feel of the song and how open-ended the lyrics are. The more vague and artfully worded the song, the more I can just put my own meaning to the words and enjoy it that way. As for songs that I can\u2019t understand because the singer mumbles or the vocals are edited to be almost unidentifiable, it drives me nuts to not know what the exact words are, but I can still enjoy the song if I really like the sound. The same goes for songs in languages I do not understand. Typically, I\u2019ll try to look up the English translation of songs in other languages, just so I know what the story is or at least I can know if there\u2019s any curse words or things in it that I don\u2019t want to sing along with out loud.

            "answer_text": "The key element to answer that question is: establishing a definition of \u2018\u2019fully appreciate\u2019\u2019. When the viewer knows all the aspects about a piece that brings the best chance for understanding the artist\u2019s intent. However, not having all the \u2018facts\u2019 produces a artistic effect in the viewer which is just as important. As an artist myself, I value the viewer\u2019s reaction/comment since it shows me things that are totally different. So my answer is: YES, it\u2019s possible. [What you don\u2019t know, you haven\u2019t missed.) But I usually do a search for the correct lyrics for songs I care about or seem mysterious. So, I\u2019d say NO. (The music becomes far more relevant and beautiful when the correct lyrics are understood.) It depends on the artist. Elvis Costello is a prime example of gaining the exact lyrics. His genius triples when you know what he\u2019s saying. Whereas using this tactic on The Ramones gains nothing. Their genius comes from a basic level were the words are not essential. The worst: When the lyrics are understood but the message is pretentious or composed of Hallmark material. [AIR SUPPLY . . .] The best: When the lyrics are understood but the message is still too complex to understand. [DYLAN . . . ] DIG ? ",

            "answer_text": "You can fully appreciate a song without knowing the lyrics. After you have heard it enough the lyrics will come to you. There are quit a few songs I love for just the music alone. Music is probably, I would say, 80% of a song. If you don't like the way it sounds your not going to care about the lyrics within the song. To get to know lyrics you have to appreciate the music itself first. Try getting some deep lyrics out of a song you don't like it's almost impossible because you can't stand to listen to the misic I couldn't. So your answer is yes you csn ",

Even their way of singing can be enough to feel and identify what they\u2019re transmitting. In addition, the instrumentalization and arrangements can be so well done and virtuously crafted that you can value the songs for their music and melody. Language should not be a barrier anyway. ",
