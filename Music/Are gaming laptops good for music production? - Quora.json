That is why music production relies on serial processing instead of parallel processing. It\u2019s always recommended to have a laptop with a higher single core clock speed than having a lower clock speed with more cores. Higher number of cores won\u2019t help you in improving your speed of your DAW or Digital Audio Workstation.   ",

            "answer_text": "May be or may not be. Each machine has different components apart from processor like GPU, display unit, sound section. Components related to gaming might have all high display enhancing components but not sound. Also, what I have seen is that, even though there are all the components on the board, sound may not be good as the overall heat generated on the board might produce some inductance. I have i7 xeon processor machine with 4GB graphics card, dual cooling system etc.. But before connecting my audio equipment, I just took a recording without connecting anything, it had noticeable sound. External audio equipment is always preferred for music production to minimize latency and inbuilt noise. ",
