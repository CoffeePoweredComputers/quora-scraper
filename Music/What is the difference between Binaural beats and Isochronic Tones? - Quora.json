            "answer_text": "Binaural beats were the precursor to this whole technology. Binaural beats work by sending one frequency to an ear and a different frequency to other ear. The brain balances out by resonating to the median of the two frequencies. Therefore you could change a person\u2019s brainwaves by playing with the frequencies sent to ears. Isochronic tones, on the other hand, uses differences of speed in sending out pulses, which the brain then tries to match. Again, the result is a change in conscious state. Isochronic tones are considered more powerful than binaural beats. Also, isochronic tones don\u2019t require headsets (although they are recommended). I\u2019ve used both in attempts to meditate and raise my level of awareness. I didn\u2019t notice any huge difference. Both are falsely advertised. Yes, they change your brainwaves for awhile and you feel different. But no, they won\u2019t alter your life for the better. They are more of a fad, or sleep aid, to me. What really showed me results was when I started meditating without any aid whatsoever. That\u2019s how you get real, lasting results. ",

            "answer_text": "Isochronic pulses are mono sound. Binaural beats are not exactly stereo, in the sense that they don\u2019t try to reproduce a \u201creal\u201d performance in a room, but they do consist of two different channels played simultaneously, so we could loosely use the word \u201cstereo\u201d, even if it\u2019s not a perfect fit. Because of the way they each work and are created (without going off into a technical fugue of \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d), both have their own advantages and drawbacks. Binaural beats are more versatile in that they can help you reach more different brainwave states (delta, theta, alpha and beta), but they do require headphones. Isochronic pulses have the advantage of not needing \u201cstereo\u201d playback, and they can be used for higher frequencies like gamma, but they don\u2019t work for the lower frequencies that are easy for binaurals.
