Even when you are doing other tasks, or falling asleep at night, you still have part of your brain focused on what you are going to do next time you sit down in front of your music production or DJing set up. There is some luck and mystery and romance and creativity involved, and that\u2019s what will give your music it\u2019s unique style, but the way to the top is no mistake or accident. Art is work. ",

Just create your own style and don\u2019t copy anyone. Everyone\u2019s success is very different. You may figure out later that music is not for you or being a DJ is not that great. Just make sure you really will enjoy what you\u2019re doing. Before you get into this line of field read about what you can do. Learn all you can about how to make music. Learn the different techniques of music you can create. There are all types of music out there. At the end is the product that matters. I think it\u2019s who you know that can propel you to succeed too. Since you just want to know how to make it in the music world all I can say is be genuine. You can self publish your own music as well. Just make sure that you know how to make some first. ",
