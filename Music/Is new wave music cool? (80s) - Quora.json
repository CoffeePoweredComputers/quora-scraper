            "answer_text": "New wave music is one of my favorite genres. Whether you like it, or think it\u2019s cool, is up to you. New wave music often used synthesizers, which some people love, and some people dislike. I am in the camp of people who love synthesizers ( a lifelong, undying love really for me.) New wave also had some style elements to it. Sometimes people dressed in skinny ties, or even wore makeup. I loved it, but again, not for everyone. As they said on the GTA Vice City soundtrack \u201cWave radio. Where the boys wear more makeup than the girls!\u201d There were a lot of one hit wonders in that era, making it hard to collect CDs, but now we have youtube, and if you do collect CDs, there were a lot of new wave compilation CDs. Picking out a nice synth laden song with cool vocals that makes you want to drive around listening to it, Talk Talk \u201cIt\u2019s my Life\u201d ( a song I used to think was by Roxy Music.) Listen to that lush synth string pad. Drum machines, and seagulls. Fabulous. It really makes me miss my youth. ",

            "answer_text": "like duh.. I can\u2019t think of any other genre from any other decade that still elicits such a strong response from people.. One of my Friday night stay at home rituals is to livestream New Wave DJs on Twitch. I would highly recommend DJWesWallace and DJjakerudh on twitch.. Also I read somewhere that OMD, the If you leave band, is making more money on tours in recent years than they did in their heyday. Look at Depeche Mode, they still sell out arenas/stadiums around the world.. Anywho to answer your question, New Wave is still cool and widely popular today.. ",
