            "answer_text": "Music always fascinated me from when I was a little kid and still does to this day. Working as a composer/sound designer for games I feel blessed every day that I can be in touch with this mystic world that touches every soul that can hear and feel. It\u2019s an endless ocean of potential and emotions that breathes life. Music saved me loads of times in the most low situations for me so far and I think will be my salvation to the very end. I am very grateful that I can pay my bills doing what I really love and at the same time be involved within this powerful force. ",

I write music, I arrange music, I write articles about music, I post lessons about music online, I talk about music in Quora and on Facebook. Music is just about always the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about when I lay my head down for the night. I dream about music, performing, even creating songs in my sleep. If you talk with me for more than five minutes, I\u2019ll invariably mention something about music. So, it is a bit important to me.
