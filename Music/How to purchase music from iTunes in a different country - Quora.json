            "answer_text": "Before you buy anything like music, movies, apps, games or subscriptions etc. you will have to set up a payment method. Depending on this payment method\u2019s currency & address, Apple will set your country. And this would be your country for all Apple Services until you change your country. To change country, use other country\u2019s payment card in that country\u2019s local currency. In short, payment card\u2019s currency sets your country not your location. There might be some purchases from previous country that you might not be able to access after changing country\u2019s so contact Apple for more information. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically you can not. Music and all media licensing goes per country basis. What is not available in your country, is most likely doesn\u2019t have a license by iTunes to be redistributed or marketed. Even if you trick the iTunes and make your country looks like some other (ahem VPN) then your other purchases which were in your original country will disappear. It is a give and take if you will. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to buy music in iTunes (Music) which is only available in a country which you don\u2019t live in, you probably need to change your country and residence in your AppleID. Using this method also works in App store. If it still doesn\u2019t work you need a VPN to cheat the system. But the thing is that when you change your address back again to where you live now after buying the music, the music from that specific country may no longer be playable due to DRM. So it is better just to find the original CD cheap on eBay and then copy it in iTunes (Music). ",
