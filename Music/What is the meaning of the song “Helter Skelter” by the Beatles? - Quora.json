            "answer_text": "A very interesting question. Because this song had two meanings:  The first was the meaning according to Paul McCartney which we could consider its true meaning since he was the one wrote the song. And second was the meaning that Charles Manson found in the song that we could consider its twisted meaning since it made him and his group to kill people. First of all, the title: 'Helter Skelter' referred to a fairground ride mainly popular in Britain, in which people could climb the inside of a wooden tower and slide down a spiral ride on the outside.  Paul McCartney about the song: \u201cI was using the symbol of a helter skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom -the rise and fall of the Roman Empire - and this was the fall, the demise, the going down. \u201cYou could have thought of it as a rather cute title but it's since taken on all sorts of ominous overtones because Manson picked it up as an anthem, and since then quite a few punk bands have done it because it is a raunchy rocker. Charles Manson: \u201cHelter Skelter means confusion. Literally, it doesn't mean war with anyone. It doesn't mean that those people are going to kill other people. It only means what it means. \u201cHelter Skelter is confusion. Confusion is coming down fast. If you don't see confusion coming down fast, you can call it what you wish. \u201cIt's not my conspiracy. It is not my music. I hear what it relates. It says, 'Rise!'. It says, \u2019Kill!'. \u201c Why blame it on me? I didn't write the music. I am not the person who projected it into social consciousness! \u201c John Lennon commented: \u201cI don't know what Helter Skelter has to do with knifing anyone. I've never listened to it properly, it was just noise.\u201d Yes, John Lennon said 'Helter Skelter' was just noise, and you\u2019d wonder why the melodic Paul wrote this raunchy track which had been described as a prototype for 1970s Heavy Metal Sound. Paul McCartney: \u201cI was in Scotland and I read in Melody Maker that Pete Townshend had said: 'We've just made the raunchiest, loudest, most ridiculous rock 'n' roll record you've ever heard\u2019. I never actually found out what track that was that The Who had made, but that got me going; just hearing him talk about it. \u201cSo I said to the guys,'I think we should do a song like that; something really wild'. And I wrote 'Helter Skelter'. \u201cYou can hear the voice cracking, and we played it so long and loud and so often that by the end of it you can hear Ringo saying, 'I've got blisters on my fingers!'\u201d As John Lennon once said about himself and Paul, \u201cWhatever they can do, we can do it better.\u201d And in the case of Helter Skelter, louder and wilder. They made it so loud and wild that unfortunately, other people like Charles Manson heard it differently. Thank you. (Sources: Anthology, Rolling Stone, Playboy) ",

            "answer_text": "The meaning is at least partly constructed by you in your own head from the associations you make from your own experience when you hear it, probably when you first heard it. There is no fixed meaning and Paul McCartney certainly can\u2019t define it. Maybe for McCartney it means he wanted to counter the suggestion that he wrote the \u201csilly love songs\u201d for the Beatles by writing a hard rocker based on childhood memories of the thrill of a fairground ride. Not just any old helter skelter. Almost certainly (IMHO) this ride,  the highest helter-skelter in the country which stood on top of Frodsham (or Overton) Hill, on the south bank of the Mersey overlooking the small town of Frodsham, from 1908 to 1977. It was part of a pleasure gardens complex and a favourite destination for mystery tours by coach and school outings. The site (and especially the top of the helter-skelter) commands a spectacular view over the Mersey estuary and the Cheshire Plain and the helter skelter itself was a prominent landmark for miles around. It\u2019s hard to believe that Paul McCartney didn\u2019t slide down it a few times. It would have been clearly visible from his home in Speke. It is undoubtedly true that The Beatles played at the Mersey View cabaret venue right next to it in 1963 and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if the lads all had a go on that night. You could get away with a lot when you were a Beatle. By the end it became derelict and it was demolished in 1977, living on only in the song and in this pub in the town below. Which is a shame.  ",
