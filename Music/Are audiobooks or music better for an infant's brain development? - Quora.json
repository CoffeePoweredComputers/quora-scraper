            "answer_text": "Talking to your infant is one of the best things you can do for brain development. Listening to audiobooks bombards the child with words, but no context. An infant learns the meanings of words by hearing the words during activities using those words. Listening to audiobooks and music does nothing to teach the infant the basics of language, which are: Making eye contact with a speaker. Learning to recognize the voices of caretakers. Learning the basics of the give-and-take of conversation, (i.e., the parent talks to the baby, the baby laughs and coos, then stops and looks in the parents eyes waiting for the parent to talk again.) That is not to say that playing music for a child whether it\u2019s classical music or children\u2019s songs is a bad thing. It\u2019s not. But think of it as supplemental to actual face-to-face, parent-to-child talking. The other way to improve your child\u2019s cognitive development is not with passive listening to audiobooks or music, but by doing things. Dance to music. Build towers. Play with pots and pans. Go for walks. Actually read and look at books with your child. Play in the water. And while you are doing these things with your baby, TALK. Talk about what you are doing. Passively listening to music and audiobooks is actually probably one of the weakest activities to do to increase brain development. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Are audiobooks or music better for an infant's brain development? As long as your infant gets opportunities to interact with adults, older kids, and same-aged peers, it really doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s playing on the tape-deck. People learn language by interacting with those who speak it, NOT by passively listening to recorded messages. The \u201cmake your child a genius\u201d audiotapes are a lot of bunk. Your infant\u2019s brain will benefit most when you and others play with your infant. Also, even if your child is years away from reading, read aloud to your child every day. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. My mother told me when I was an infant she used to play Les Paul and Mary Ford records for me. I ended up becoming a professional musician/guitarist. I\u2019m now 68 years old. It was a curse, not the best career choice. My mother was wonderful. Wouldn\u2019t change a thing except perhaps my career choice. Live music almost disappeared. Today it\u2019s just a shadow of what it once was. Just my thoughts. ",
