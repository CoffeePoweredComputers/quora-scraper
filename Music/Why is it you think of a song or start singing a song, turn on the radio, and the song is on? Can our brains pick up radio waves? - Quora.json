            "answer_text": "What you are experiencing is a common reaction to coincidental events that seem like cases of synchronicity. Their is no significant evidence to support synchronicity. The perception is based on the brain's natural tendency to find patterns. In the millions of events that occur each day, it is very likely that a few coincidences are going to happen. What you are missing is the realization that you are not noticing the times when coincidences do not happen. So, your brain registers only the events that are related and ignores the far larger number of unrelated events. ",

            "answer_text": "When you spontaneously start thinking of a song, there\u2019s a good chance the song you think of will be a current hit song. If you\u2019re thinking of a current hit song and you turn on the radio, there\u2019s a good chance that song will be playing when you turn it on. When that happens, you tend to notice it. You tend not to notice all the times when you turn on the radio and the song you\u2019re thinking of is not on. ",
