            "answer_text": "This is more complicated than it seems. I will try to break it down for you. When we're singing, we want to use our bodies as resonators. Different registers of our voices use different areas of our body in differing amounts. Our lower registers tend to resonate more in our chests, and our higher registers resonate more in our heads. When we're resonating properly, our voices sound round and warm. Most inexperienced singers sing with tense vocal folds with a sound that is very dark and \"back.\" They are not properly directing the sound to resonate in their heads in particular. To address this, voice teachers talk about the \"mask.\" They encourage a faint buzzing in your cheek bones to let you know your entire head is resonating with the sound. This is the forward \"nasal resonance\" we want. The problem is, a lot of people take \"nasal resonance\" and turn it into \"singing into the nose.\" You hear this a ton on Broadway. This \"nasally\" sound is caused by a drooping soft palate. While it's forward, healthier, and generally louder than the \"dark, back\" sound produced beforehand, it's buzzy, unpleasant, and not what we're going for. Many voice teachers often teach their students to purposely sing into their noses to get them out of their throats, and then tell them \"ok, now go for the same feeling, but hold your nose.\" Sometimes this works. Sometimes they never get out of their nose. Personally, when I'm going for proper resonance, thinking of directing the sound up out of the top of my head is a more useful visualization for me than thinking of the \"mask.\" But everyone has to find their \"resonant feeling\" their own way, and be told by listeners \"yes, that's right.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Nasal resonance is when sound gets into your nasal cavity and bounces around. It's a bit confusing because there's basically two different ways this happens, depending on what you do with your Soft palate (a.k.a. velum).  One type of nasality is when some or all of the air passes through the nasal cavity. Most vowels in most dialects of spoken English are completely non-nasal in this sense, because the soft palate seals against the back of the throat and all the air comes out the mouth. By contrast, the sounds \"n\", \"m\" and \"ng\" are completely nasal, because the soft palate drops but there's a block in the mouth, so all the air goes out the nose. French has some true Nasal vowels where air and sound come out both nose and mouth simultaneously. Now in some styles of singing, such as Broadway, it's conventional to make all the vowels a little bit nasal in terms of air. That produces a bit of extra volume and a bit of edge to the tone, which is helpful in cutting through an orchestra. Some people like this effect and some people hate it. By contrast, in classical singing, the standard technique is to copy speech as far as where the air goes. So most English vowels are completely non-nasal (except sometimes those adjacent to \"n\", \"m\" and \"ng\") and the only time you'd deliberately sing with your soft palate unsealed is for a French nasal vowel. At the same time, classical technique involves the soft palate being more or less permanently raised, as if in a partial yawn. The primary effect of this is to create large amounts of space in the mouth, which of course is good for letting sound out. But it also stretches the soft palate thin and wide across the space at the back of the mouth so that sound can get into the nasal cavity through it, without air flowing. And when you're doing this right, you get the buzzing in the nose and sinuses that's called singing in the mask. This significantly adds to the sound without making the tone obviously nasal. ",
