            "answer_text": "Sometimes you can remove the vocals from a song and you can\u2019t do it from just any song. The song must be stereo, as the process does not work in mono. If the recording was ever mono , it will not work. Multiple voices such as choirs and duets may not work. Put the song into an audio editor. Reverse the polarity of one of the channels and mix to mono and any thing that was panned to the center and common to both channels will cancel. The most likely to disappear are Vocals, Kick Drum, and Bass. Ifyou want to save some of the low frequencies, apply a high pass filter to one of the tracks in the editor. Some things are not going to cancel such as certain vocal effects and stereo reverb. This will leave a ghost voice. Music from MP3 sources is not as good as from a CD as MP3 introduces certain phase anomalies. You may need to play with the gain between your source channel to get the best cancellation. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that it is doable. Try and get the tracks separately from whomever produced the song. Seems to me that is the simplest way. Also, is there not a copyright infringement, taking someone\u2019s tracks without their permission. I would be interested in knowing the answer to that. About my songs, I would definitely kick up a fuss if someone extracted my tracks from one of my songs without my permission. Maybe it is allowed. I will find out, if for no other reason but that I want to know as a songwriter with copyrights on my songs. ",
