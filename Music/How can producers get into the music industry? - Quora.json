Create a playlist on Soundcloud or something similar and post everything you make up there. Build a massive body of work. Over time, you will start to see how much improvement you\u2019re making in your craft and you will become undeniably good at what you do, but you have to put in the work. Along the way, build or produce tracks for anyone you can. Don\u2019t do anything for free, but make creating content the priority. Work for $5 or a burrito if you have to. If you put in the work, you will have the resum\u00e9 of good material to recruit better talent to produce as time goes on. The best way to get into producing music is to start making music with whatever you currently have now and more doors will open from there. The Music Stuff Show ",

            "answer_text": "Get in Instagram and search hashtags for artists complaining about their producers or complaining about their lack of production skills. Comment that you saw their plea and offer to talk to them about how you can help them achieve what they are looking to. Spend more time reaching out and offering to help people and less time peddling your wares as an upstart producer. Producing is about solving problems. Solve someone\u2019s problem and you\u2019ll be a helluva lot closer to becoming their producer. ",
