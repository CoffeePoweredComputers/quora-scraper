            "answer_text": "There are 3 Calculus classes: Calculus I,II,III. There are several online resources but I recommend that you use a hard copy book along with your studies to help in addition to the main course and khan academy: This should be your main class: MIT OCW 18.01 (18.01 is what they call Calculus I and II. Calculus III is 18.02) Single Variable Calculus. Multivariable Calculus. The links are to MIT\u2019s classes designed specifically for self learners so if you see another link on the website to the courses and see there isn\u2019t an \u201csc\u201d in the URL then it will have less notes and content than the links I provided. There are video lectures on youtube for single and multivariable calculus:  (If the links do not work, just google MIT 18.01 lectures on you tube. The link with lecture 1 in the title should be the correct video. If you are still unsure about it, please let me know in the comments). 2. Khan academy really isn\u2019t as challenging or as good to learn calculus on your own since it doesn\u2019t have too much practice with it, however, you can still use it as a resource along with the OCW book (In the links I have earlier you should scroll through the websites and see the syllabus for the books). or another online book as a resource for questions. Extra resources that you should use: Book: The best book for Calculus in general as a general consensuses on the internet has to be Stewart's book that has the solutions in the last pages of the PDF: http://www.vnua.edu.vn/khoa/fita/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/stewart.pdf.Chuvien.gui_.pdf If you want a hard copy amazon has one that\u2019s newer but a few changes are the only difference: Calculus: Early Transcendentals: James Stewart: 9781285741550: Amazon.com: Books Questions: If you have questions over any calculus, there is a free chat: CalcChat.com - Calculus solutions. The books on the website are not as good as Stewart's book however. Note: There are a variety of resources that I have presented to you. If you feel the need to use the MIT course\u2019s book for example, feel free to do so. However, I am speaking simply based on the wide variety of books that I have seen before and their reviews. Please let me know if you have more questions :) -Mike ",
