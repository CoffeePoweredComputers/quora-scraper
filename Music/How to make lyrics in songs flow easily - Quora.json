            "answer_text": "A really easy way is to try to tell a story within your song. It captivates listeners and makes it easier to make your lyrics flow. After some practice with this, you can try to get back into writing other types of lyrical songs. Another thing I like to do is try to make my song seem casual, almost conversation like. If you aren\u2019t looking for this type of tone in your song though, then avoid this. Making a song flow really depends on what type of song you are trying to write. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, there is no magical way to make your song instantly flow. It just takes practice. ",

            "answer_text": "I have recently become interested in writing lyrics for songs, and have had this problem myself. What helped me at first, was I say it out loud while writing, and decided if it had a good enough flow, if it was good for the type of song I was creating and the tempo I had in mind. Another thing that helped me is measuring each line, by both syllables and how many beats (or measures) it would take to say it all. Then I would use a metronome app on my phone and turn it on and test what I had written, to see where I should change it and how. My last piece of advice, is come up with a minimal beat for the song before you write, or atleast decide upon the tempo, if it is a slow gospel song, or a fast rap song, it can greatly affect on how it sounds on the track. (Also don\u2019t afraid to use wrong grammar and misprounnounce words when needed.) Hope I helped! ",
