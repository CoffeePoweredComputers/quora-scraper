            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Things differ slightly here depending on the country you live in, but I\u2019m from the UK so the purposes of my answer I\u2019m answering from that perspective. To simplify things, let\u2019s assume that the artist in question did not write the song and has 0% publishing rights, and thus no mechanical royalty entitlement either. This leaves them solely with performance royalties. In the UK, the main artist(s) on a record are designated \u2018Featuring Artists\u2019 by PPL, the organisation responsible for collecting and distributing performance royalties. This entitles them to a stake in the ownership of the master recording rights, the percentage of which can vary, and which in turn generate performance royalties every time a song is played by a qualifying source like a radio station or music TV channel. This is notably different from the system in the USA where non-songwriting artists do not receive royalties from radio plays. PPL DOES NOT collect royalties from plays on Spotify. Thus, artists do not automatically receive royalties from Spotify plays - unlike writers/publishing rights holders, who generally collect both songwriting and mechanical royalties through PRS and MCPS (the bodies responsible for those kinds of royalties) respectively. According to CNBC, Spotify pays out somewhere between $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream to the owner of the master recording rights; in the case of signed artists, this will generally be the label, although it is also common for producers, writers and some artists to get a share of this revenue depending on the agreements each party has with the label. HOWEVER, in the case of artists, remember that the label will generally retain all revenue from exploiting the track(s) in question until they have recouped what they call \u2018bona fide\u2019 costs for marketing, branding etc. With the revenue from streaming for the average artist being so abysmally low, this means that more often that not the artist won\u2019t see a penny of that revenue for a long time, if ever. This is just a simplistic overview, but to answer your question: No, the average music artist does not make money from streaming. The situation is slightly different if the artist in question also wrote/co-wrote the track, but even then only a minuscule number of tracks in the grand scheme of things get enough plays to generate any sort of respectable income. All the best, Benedict ",

On Spotify, a song has to be played for 30 seconds to counted as a play.To get the full amount available the song has to played 90 seconds. The most a song will pay out, on average, is $0.0039 USD 99% of all streaming on Spotify comes from only the top 10% of the songs on spotify. So the average musician is not going to make much. To make $10,000 USD an artist needs around 2.56 million streams, around 90,000 listeners per month. The average musician does not know how to do that. The average musician is just\u2026well, average; and has average songs, average music, and average work ethic. Above average musicians that spend the time to put a marketing plan together and invests in their music career like any other business, can make above average money from streaming. But 80% of the musician out there, won\u2019t put in the effort or invest the money. They spend more on the newest coolest guitar, software, etc\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Musicians are not earning more now, despite having new revenue channels. Spotify admits the average per-stream payout to rights holders lands somewhere between $0.006 and $0.0084 (that\u2019s between 6 tenths and 8.5 tenths of a cent. Per Play!). At this rate, an artist would need to get 200k plays per month on Apple Music or 230K plays on Spotify just to earn the US minimum wage. Just last year, however, Spotify\u2019s executives earned, on average, $1.34 million each, with the top five taking home over $26 million between them, and the 'big three' record labels made a record-breaking *$14.2 million a day* from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. The Universal Music Group alone made $4.5 million every 24 hours The internet was supposed to free musicians from label tyranny and abuse, but after all the innovation, it's still the major labels getting all the money, while the people who actually MAKE the music get crumbs. This is longish at about 14 minutes, but worth watching:  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, music artists make significant income from streaming. Not by relying on Spotify, but by publishing their own TV channels on Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV with Nano Express (this way, when you add a new video to your TV program, it is automatically reflected on all the supported platforms). The good example is our Guitar School channel on Roku. In the first month, over 10,000 people put the channel on their Roku device. To-date, over 150,000 viewers. We\u2019re creating guitar videos, but Jim Larkin from BaronsMedia (the company which manages TV advertising on our channels) reports that podcast channels are doing very well too. ",
