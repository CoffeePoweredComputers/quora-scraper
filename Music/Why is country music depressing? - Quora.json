            "answer_text": "\u201cCountry music is hypothesized to nurture a suicidal mood through its concerns with problems common in the suicidal population, such as marital discord, alcohol abuse, and alienation from work. The results of a multiple regression analysis of 49 metropolitan areas show that the greater the airtime devoted to country music, the greater the white suicide rate. The effect is independent of divorce, southernness, poverty, and gun availability. The existence of a country music subculture is thought to reinforce the link between country music and suicide. Our model explains 51% of the variance in urban white suicide rates.\u201d To be fair, Some newer country music seems to have a different theme in words. Interestingly, there is some evidence that a song or two a couple of times a week would have the opposite effect. Contrast. For some of us, the contrast of listening to a genre we enjoy more, might also be uplifting. ",

But in truth, there is no evidence that these music genres are sadder than others. Also, the music itself does not cause depression; however, it can make you experience a depressed mood. this is related to your personal experience, level of empathy and the mood you were before starting to listen to a particular song. Understanding what makes music sad: ModesModes involve the arrangement and ordering of musical notes in a particular key. It\u2019s this arrangement of notes that create the chords we hear, which lend themselves to our perception of a piece\u2019s tonality. TempoTempo refers to the speed, or pace, of a musical piece, with fast music portraying happiness and slow music portraying sadness.
