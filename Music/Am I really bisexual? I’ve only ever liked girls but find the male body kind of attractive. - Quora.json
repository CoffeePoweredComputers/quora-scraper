            "answer_text": "You could be bisexual. You could also not be bisexual. Finding something attractive and being sexually/emotionally attracted to something is not the same thing. If you want to, explore that part of your identity but also don\u2019t pressure yourself or worry too much about a label, when you\u2019re certain of your feelings you can worry about those things. I am not saying anyone might be too young to know their sexual identity, but many teenagers experience bi-curious feelings as their bodies change and adapt. You might be seeing your assigned-male friends and be attracted to parts of their bodies that you envy? Regardless - explore, be safe & don\u2019t worry too much about a label. ",

It\u2019s just a matter of the proportions in the mix. One may be 79 percent straight and 19 percent homosexual, with the remaining 2 percent being you attracted to, say, animals. Entirely possible!
