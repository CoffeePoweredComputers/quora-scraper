            "answer_text": "It\u2019s my understanding if someone is of legal age and they can pass a background check there is nothing preventing them from buying a firearm. If they still live at home and their parents don\u2019t want it in the house that is a completely different issue. I watched a episode of Live PD a while back where a landlord called the police on a tenant because the tenant was a gun collector and had several in the home. The landlord was an anti-gun nut and wanted the guns out of the house and called the police. The police arrived and said there was nothing they could do as the tenant had the right to own them, was being responsible by keeping them secured and was not breaking any laws. Despite what the landlord had stated in the lease the police could do nothing about it. So it became a civil dispute. The same thing would happen between an adult child and the parents. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and NO. IF the child is an adult and can pass the BG checks, no they cant stop the child from buying a gun. They can tell the adult child they can live there but no guns because its their house and their rules. . BUT there is a grey area. IF the child is paying rent like a tenant/landlord then no the parent cannot prevent the child from bringing any legal product into their home. So they would be playing with the constitutional rights of the child. No different then if they banned the child from voting. they cannot stop a legal adult child from owning a gun but they can ask the child to move out if they want to own that gun. Now if the child was acting badly and threatening to harm themselves or others the parents can contact lawenforcement to deal with it. ",
