            "answer_text": "Depends on what kind of guitar you have. As Thomas Sowers said, if you have a classical guitar, you can put a capo at position five and you\u2019ll get something that approximates a standard ukulele. It won\u2019t sound exactly like a uke, because a classical guitar has a much larger body and a deeper bass response, but it will get you close enough to \u2018fake\u2019 it through a song. You don\u2019t have to take off the low E and A strings, btw, just don\u2019t play those! Taking off the D string, and replacing it with another high E string would let you tune it up an octave to simulate the ukulele\u2019s characteristic re-entrant tuning. Yes, you \u201ccould\u201d put nylon strings on a steel string acoustic guitar, but I really don\u2019t think that make sense. For $20 you can get a \u201cplunker\u201d ukulele, and that\u2019s probably a better real \u201canswer\u201d here. ",

            "answer_text": "You could cut the neck down and snap a string? Just kidding - if you really wanted a ukelele sound I\u2019d recommend testing out different pedal settings or hooking yourself into DAW software where you can mess with virtual pedals. It can definitely be done if you have the time and the patience! But then again, maybe just by a ukelele? They\u2019re not expensive! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how accurate you need to be. I once wrote a reggae ukulele part for a song one of my bands did, that was really essential to the groove. We liked to play it live, and I didn\u2019t want to bring a ukulele just for one song, so I\u2019d play it on electric guitar. Exact same notes, very different sound. ",

That\u2019s about it, but you can take it a step further by putting the same size string on the lowest string as you would the highest string and tune that to high G. That\u2019s how I learned before getting an actual ukulele. ",
