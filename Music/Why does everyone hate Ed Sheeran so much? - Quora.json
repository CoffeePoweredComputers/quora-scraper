            "answer_text": "If you look at the story, you see that\u2019s not \u201cpeople\u201d. That\u2019s twitter, which is a biased sample of loudly opinionated people. When you consider what has been posted to others on twitter (including death and rape threats), Sheeran has had very mild abuse. I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201chate\u201d, quite a lot of it seems to be a very tired ginger busker joke. Yawn. But why did he become a target, even in a relatively mild way? Probably ubiquity and a feeling that the people who praise his stuff do so uncritically and to an unwarranted degree. I mean, he\u2019s fine, but he gets lauded as some incredible once-in-a-generation original talent, which is a bit of a stretch. To be fair, I don\u2019t think he does that, it\u2019s unimaginative press mostly. ",

I can\u2019t stand his whimpering, pouting, whining mouth just like the rest of today\u2019s \u2018weemale\u2019 noise makers. And\u2026 Yes. He can make himself more presentable looking, starting with a shower. Comb his hair. Then shave off all the hideous red pubic looking hairs from his face. Wear something classier than that lumberjack shirt or the army jacket. I don\u2019t normally believe in tanning spas, but he can use some color. He looks like a zombie from The Walking Dead. ",
