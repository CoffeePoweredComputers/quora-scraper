            "answer_text": "Infinite is Eminem's first album, published in 1996. It's a street album produced strictly for the underground scene of Detroit. They only printed 500 tapes of it, so today its pretty hard to find an original one. Both the Infinite album and the Slim Shady EP can't be found on iTunes, mainly because Eminem considered this early works childish and so didn't want to re-print them for the mainstream scene. ",
