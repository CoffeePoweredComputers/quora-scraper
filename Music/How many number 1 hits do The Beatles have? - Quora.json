            "answer_text": "In Australia, it comes to a total of 26 Number One hits from 1963 to 1970. The Beatles dominated the charts through this period. John, Paul, George and Ringo spent a total number of 130 weeks sitting at Number One. That is for over 31 per cent - or almost a third of the weeks - of that 8 year period a Beatle\u2019s track sat at the top of the charts. From the end of 1963 through 1964 into the start of 1965, The Beatles dominated the charts with 45 weeks at Number One. There were a couple of hits during this 8 year period that also did well on the charts like \u2018She Loves You\u2019 and \u2018Yesterday\u2019 that did not make Number One. Many of the singles or EP\u2019s released were Double-A sides. That is, there were two hits or more on the record. Any examples? One 45 RPM single pressed had Yellow Submarine with Eleanor Rigby on it in 1966 and another had Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever on it in 1967. It is also of note that many LP\u2019s went to Number One. The most notable is Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. The Beatles did not release any singles from that album. By the way, Lennon and McCartney, in particular, wrote songs that they gave away to other singers or groups that topped the charts, if not in Australia, elsewhere in the world. For example, Cilla Black with It\u2019s For You and the classic, Step Inside Love, Peter & Gordon with A World Without Love, B. J. Kramer with The Dakotas and Bad To Me, Gerry and The Pacemakers with Hello Little Girl, Mary Hopkins with Goodbye etc. The Rolling Stones had their first breakthrough hit reaching the top of the charts with a cover of a Beatles/Lennon and McCartney throwaway song: I Wanna Be Your Man. A group called (The) Marmalade had one of their biggest hits when they purchased copies of the music and lyrics to Ob-la -de Ob- la -da before the Beatle\u2019s single from the White Album was released. They did a cover and beat the Beatles to the top of the charts. That should give some indication of how big the Beatles are in terms of their position at the top of the tree for popular music in the both the Twentieth Century and so far into the Twenty-First Century as their influence still looms.

(\u2018Penny Lane\u2019, released between \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 and \u2018All You Need Is Love\u2019 reached only number 2, otherwise they would have had 18 - yes 18 - successive No 1 hits. I think they had more No 1s in the USA but that\u2019s because Capitol Records \u2018butchered\u2019 their UK albums and released what were only album tracks in the UK as singles in the USA . ",
