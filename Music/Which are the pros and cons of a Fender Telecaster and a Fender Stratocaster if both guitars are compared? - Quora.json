            "answer_text": " Models of ~Fender Stratocaster [top] & Fender Telecaster [bottom] To answer this, we need to look at two things about guitars, as with these top Fender makes. One is the quality of them that makes both so great to play, and also a guitar musician's preference as to why they chose the Fender, and for that matter, how & why we as musicians decide to choose any guitar over another. So there's the \u2018technical reasons\u2019 for which guitar suits one\u2019s taste, and the individual\u2019s 'emotive\u2019 influence reasoning; the feeling a musician gets out of it. I\u2019ll get into first the individual reasoning, that I like to refer to as, a guitarist having an 'instant chemistry' - an unexpected psychological relationship, when trying out any guitar, as The Fender, maybe one\u2019s tried out for the first time. It's a fascinating wondrous experience, which I have felt many times, being selective in a music store to a 2nd hand shop, going through trying out various electric guitars, and I've had this kind of 'serendipity' moment, a part intuitive feeling, taking a unique looking guitar off the shelf and plugging it in. Then suddenly, I'm playing some 'melodic phrase' or 'riff' that surely seemed I never really did before, so there's this relationship, to keep on playing it and then feeling sure it's the guitar you want. I recall this \u2018emotive touch\u2019 occurred awhile ago, with a white Stratocaster, I enjoyed right away, bought it, then later sold as I have bought & sold many guitars. I was onto a Gibson that I still have, that felt great for furthering my jazz/blues playing. I still retain a \u2018Telecaster\u2019, \u2018Gibson\u2019 , electric as well as an acoustic \u2018Gretsch\u2019 dark wood dobro, [especially for slide guitar playing] & a \u2018Beaver Creek\u2019 acoustic.  [above] Eric Clapton playing one of his fave blue Stratocasters, [seems he\u2019s liked the blue colours, since around 1989] As Eric Clapton put it, in 1999, while discussing auctioning off much of his large collection of guitars for his cause, \u2018the CrossRoads\u2019 Rehab Center\u2019 [in Antigua] ~ \"I watched that Christie\u2019s auction sale 'live' on computer while in a recording studio. It was \u201cBrownie\u201d, my favourite '1956 Fender Stratocaster',[that sold for the highest price ever for any auctioned guitar], that chokes me up still. They all meant a lot to me and still do, so seeing the sale, was traumatic, but, it\u2019s \u2018the cause\u2019 that made the difference, because I wouldn\u2019t have parted it for anything else.\"  [above]\u2018Brownie\u2019 -Eric Clapton\u2019s most expensive auctioned guitar - Clapton recorded \u2019Layla\u2019 with it & was his first Fender Stratocaster with \u2018Cream\u2019. Eric Clapton mentions about how he selected his guitars; \"Sometimes I might not know what I want and then I'll play it, and it\u2019s like I never heard something like that before. That first sound is very inspiring; a lot of songs are born out of that. Making the transition from one guitar to the next can come from any direction. It can be triggered by a need to hear another sound, or I\u2019ve seen or heard somebody playing a guitar that I want to emulate. The musical side coupled with the image governs it. The image, the colour maybe, is always a big part, and even, if the guitar is from a certain period. I'll start out with a broad view of what I\u2019m looking for, narrow it down to the one I think as most useful to me and what I\u2019m most comfortable with.\"  \u201dCause We've Ended as Lovers\u201d- Jeff Beck, at \u2018Crossroads Festival\u2019, playing his off-white Stratocaster. E.C. & the others are using Strats. incl. the bassist. Beck uses his Fender in unique ways, utilizing the \u2018tremolo bar\u2019 & other techniques, as he infers, \u201chaving the guitar resonate, to challenge the limits of its sound, not just the \u2018usual guitar sound\u2019.\u201d Back to what Clapton conveyed, I've had this intuitive \u2018feeling\u2019 occur, quite a few times, also;- picking out a guitar that felt was special to me over the other ones I tried out. It's knowing which are good guitars first, and I'm sure I'm like many guitarists, who can be also initially impressed by the colour and form of a guitar to want to try it out. But, yes, it's also technical things to adjust with once highly interested, like the tone, the sound, the guitar neck providing an ease for the hand and finger motion, when playing up and down the fingerboard to chording, intonation, solid tuning pegs, and other elements. I've gone through many guitars, being Gibsons, Fenders, Gretsch, Peavy, Aria to Ibanez electric guitars, all having been made in different years. I fell in love with and bought a \u20181956 Gibson ES-225T hollowbody\u2019. [below]>  Later I sold it, to buy another guitar that took my interest, which has been the case off and on with both my electric and acoustic guitar buying. Each time I've bought a new guitar, I was immersed into playing more and better, thus learning new techniques to practicing new songs or guitar styles. That\u2019s part of the chemistry in trying out a new guitar that you take to, or vice -versa. Fender guitars are very much the best and most popular guitars to have and play outside, of the Gibson guitars. The Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster are of course the top Fender makes. While there are many similarities between these two solid-body Fender electrics, they also share a few key differences, which have made them especially popular with different types of players from \u2018country music\u2019, \u2018pop\u2019 and \u2018blues\u2019, and \u2018rock\u2019 and many other genres.  Buddy Guy - great Blues guitarist/singer & Fender user Jazz guitarists tend to use varied widths of hollow-bodied electric guitars, as Gibson, Gretsch, Ibanez, to Godin and so on, much due to their tone and preference for being not solid-body. This genre does not discount the Fender, as many of the modern Jazz guitarists have used it, as Pat Metheny, Johnny Smith,Michael Landau and others.  Wes Montgomery [famous jazz guitarist] with a GibsonL5 semi-acoustic electric Before I get into the specifics of the differences between the two Fender models, it really helps put things into perspective when you know how each guitar came to be, because they are definitely closely tied to each other even within the Fender family of guitars. To the unknowing person, it seems as though the Stratocaster is the natural evolution of Telecaster, as how it came out later, featured an extra pickup, a \u201cbetter\u201d body shape and an added tremolo bridge. Those who have played the two are more likely to akin it to a little brother, big brother relationship, as the two are similar but uniquely their own, with players on both sides of the argument. As mentioned above, while the added 'tremolo' bar bridge seems like an extra, but when used a lot, it detuned guitar quicker, so those who had no interest in the tremolo effect saw it as a negative. The added pickup also didn\u2019t necessarily make the Stratocaster superior, as many still preferred the sound of the Telecaster [and nowadays you can get a three pickup \u2018Tele\u2019, nullifying that argument]. I think I\u2019m making my point that what works for some doesn\u2019t for others and that doesn\u2019t necessarily make either guitar \u201cbetter.\u201d  The \u2018Tremolo bar\u2019 bridge, [an added feature] guitarists as Jeff Beck to David Gilmore use to it\u2019s fullest extent, while others don\u2019t feel the need for it So now, on to the deeper differences and what they mean to those trying to decide between them. The main differences that matter as far as 'tone' & 'timbre' are a bit harder for those unfamiliar with electric guitars to comprehend, so newcomers might have a hard time deciding which sound they prefer from simply reading about it. The best way to compare the sound of two guitars is to play both CLEAN [I can\u2019t stress that enough, as any two guitars will sound similar enough, if you give it enough distortion]. So tone & timbre are terms often confused and misunderstood. They are related, but are quite different things.  \u2018EQ\u2019 Knobs: Knobs labeled on guitar amplifier. [Fender also makes great amps.] Without getting too technical, just think of \u2018tone\u2019 as the type of changes you can make with the 'EQ knobs' [bass, middle, treble, etc. on your amp.], while \u2018timbre\u2019 is the \"character\" of the different sounds you can get with different pickups. This will allow you to be able to hear the natural timbre of the instrument.  Jimmy Vaughn & Eric Clapton, both with Strats Eric Clapton\u2019s take on the 'Stratocaster' vs the 'Telecaster', he's described the sound of the Strat, \"as more compressed, while the \u2018Tele\u2019 has more highs and lows\". Eric prefers the Stratocaster much for that reason, but also for tone to the weight/fit on stage, of the guitar which suits him well. [Below] is like the Fender Telecaster I had, I later sold, which is closest to what Keith Richards has many of.  Fender Telecaster with fine\u2018wood-grain\u2019 finish. Looks much like what I once had. Now, for Keith Richards\u2019 preference being the \u2018Telecaster\u2019, which he has quite a few of, most with the wood or off-white finish that's he uses often. \"It's not a complicated guitar to have to think about, it does the job for me\", he has said.  [above]Keith Richards\u2019 array of guitars in a custom built trolley, on stage, while on tour. He has 5 Telecasters shown. He also has a tech guy tune/fix them & a person to make sure he gets the \u2018right guitar\u2019 on stage to use for particular songs Keith's had several customized so they have only 5 strings, simply a convenience, partly since he so often plays using open tuning, thus not requiring the low 6th string.  Keith Richards talks about the Telecaster As to which sound is preferable is up to what kind of music you will be looking to play. Those searching for a twangy and bright sound like that prized in country or rockabilly, to rock, gravitate more towards the Telecaster, as players looking for a bit more simple with greater gain control such as that found in several types of genres -blues, blues/rock, punk to metal, more often head towards a Stratocaster.  Vince Gill is a fabulous guitarist & as more of a Rock-a-billy/Country music style player he prefers the Telecaster  \u201cDon't Let Me down\u201d ~ John Mayer & Keith Urban - I had to add this fab song, done \u2018live\u2019, as it has Mayer using a \u2018Strat\u2019 while Urban is using a \u2018Tele\u2019. Which would be right for you? In the end, the differences between the Telecaster and the Stratocaster may not seem apparent at first, but once you spend time with the two, they are truly and uniquely their own. Those looking to exploit the tremolo effect and don\u2019t mind a bit more frequent tuning along with a slight growl would be wise to pick up a Stratocaster while those more prone to playing bright and clean with a nice versatile set of pickups will love the sound of the Telecaster. Of course, one could customize, to alter the guitar to be innovative. Ultimately, these two Fenders are both great guitars that have lived on strong ever since they were both introduced in the \u201850s\u2019. Whichever side of the fence you end up leaning on, just know that there are plenty of greats at your side, to attest to, how fabulous a guitar each one is. I\u2019ve enjoyed both. This \u2018demo\u2019 video [below] you'll get a kick out of, and certainly helps you to visualize how he plays them, with subtle simple techniques, like changing the sound by using the guitar\u2019s tone to volume knobs at times. But it\u2019s hearing the similarities and differences in these two top Fender guitars that\u2019s exciting. I find this demo very good, as he plays tastefully with both of them. This video is well edited, as the 'studio guitarist' is shown first playing the \u2018red\u2019 Fender Telecaster, then onto playing the \u2018green\u2019 Fender Stratocaster, and thus, back & forth as both Fenders are nicely synced, with the same backup rhythm for each model, without using any 'distorted' pedal efx.  I\u2019ve enjoyed playing these top 2 Fenders, which will be around a long time. My colour preference has been red, blue to the wood grain finish. Play on! :) ",
