            "answer_text": "There are several great pianists that are currently alive. Some of them are: Martha Argerich (1941 - ). She is widely held as one of the greatest pianist of all time.Daniel Barenboim (1942 - ). Also an Argentine, he is also considered one of the world's best pianistKrystian Zimerman (1956 - ). A Polish pianist that is considered one of the finest living pianist and one of the best interpreter of Chopin's work and Romantic-era music.Vladimir Ashkenazy (1937 - ) is another Russian pianist. He covers quite a bit of composers from Beethoven, Chopin to Rachmaninov and Ravel. His technical ability is amazing and he has great articulation.There are several younger pianist that are on their way to the \"greats\" and are critically acclaim: Daniil Trifonov (1991 - ) is a Russian pianist. He has won the 5th prize for the International Scriabin Competition and the 1st place in the International Competition of San Marino. He has been hail by many great pianists, including Martha Argerich.Evgeny Kissin (1971 - ) is a Russian - British pianist. He is very close to being in the same tier as Barenboim and/or Martha. His work/performance is top notch and he deserves to be on the Hall of Fame along with those people. He just needs more time and if he keep up his work, he'll be recognize as one of the greatest pianist within several decades.Valentina Lisitsa (1973 - ) is, once again, another Ukrainian - Russian - British pianist. She rised to fame through a different medium. Instead of the more traditional \"win competitions, get famous\" path, she utilizes YouTube and gain a large fan base through her videos. She potentially has the best technique in this list of pianist, she posesses the speed, agility, dexterity and control of the devil. It really is amazing watching her playing a difficult passage of a piece of music, her fingers dance through the keys effortlessly and seemingly easy.Lang Lang (1982 - ) is the last but not least. An outliar, he's a Chinese pianist that is definitely one of a kind. He performs with quite a bit of \"theatrics\", and a lot of his audience don't like it. Regardless of the disapproval for his obsessive facial expression, his skill is truly mesmorizing. His repertoire spans dozens of concertos, sonatas and other pieces.P/S: note that this list only contains classical pianist. Although some of them might perform different genre, their primary genre is classical. This is because I rarely listen to something else beside classical, hence my limited knowledge about different pianists other than classical pianists. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I admit I\u2019m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to this subject. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to see any of these pianists perform live; their recordings are great though. I\u2019m going to try to mention people that others haven\u2019t Here are a few of my favorites though: Daniil Trifonov - He plays with the best, roundest tone. He can play with great power, but it never gets bangy. He\u2019s technically accurate, but can also bring out varying colors and emotions. He\u2019s also the youngest on this list by far - I\u2019m excited for what he\u2019ll do in the future! I find it surprising that he doesn\u2019t make anyone else\u2019s list. He\u2019s also sort of my celeb crush *giggles*I especially enjoy his interpretations of Chopin (just, everything), as well as Lizst\u2019s Transcendental etudes. He also plays Rachmaninoff\u2019s Variations on a Theme of Paganini nicely.  Krystian Zimerman - He has really mastered color. Beautiful tone, and he can play every note a slightly different color if he wants to. A bit shy, he tends to stay away from the limelight. He has few recordings, and does not perform in the United States anymore. He\u2019s pretty versatile as well, covering everything from Mozart to Brahms to Debussy to Rachmaninoff.His interpretation of Rach 2 is to die for. :) I also like his interpretations of Beethoven\u2019s piano concertos (the third is probably my favorite).  Olga Kern - To anyone who says that women can\u2019t play Rachmaninoff:1. lol what\u2019s your issue2. Listen to Olga Kern\u2019s interpretation of Rach 3, then we\u2019ll talk.Really though, her interpretation is among my favorites. She\u2019s also good at Liszt.  There are many other high quality pianists as well (Andrey Gugnin, Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissin, Emanuel Ax\u2026) but I\u2019d have to say these three are my favorites. ",
