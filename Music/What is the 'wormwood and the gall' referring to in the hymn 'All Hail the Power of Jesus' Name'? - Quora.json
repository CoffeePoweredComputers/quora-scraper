            "answer_text": "This refers to the bitterness of life. Firstly, Wormwood is mentioned several times in the Bible. The herb, wormwood, is a bitter root (intoxicating and poisonous) that symbolizes this suffering world.  Here are the lyrics\u2026 3. Sinners, whose love can ne'er forgetthe wormwood and the gall,the wormwood and the gall,go spread your trophies at his feet,and crown him, crown him,crown him, crown him,and crown him Lord of all. The Jews use \u201cbitter herbs\u201d in their passover celebration to symbolize the sorrow of their slavery in Egypt. (Today they use horseradish). Whenever wormwood is mentioned in the Bible, Old and New Testaments, it is referring to this sorry world. Lamentations 3:15 refers to wormwood as a metaphor for affliction. In Revelation 8:11, a star named Wormwood falls to earth and makes a third of the water bitter, killing many people. Finally, when Christ was in the garden, before the cross, he prayed that God would take the \u201ccup\u201d from him. This referred to the bitter cup of suffering he would take on behalf of those who would be saved by his death, atonement, and resurrection. The connection between \u201cwormwood and the gall\u201d and \u201ccrown him\u201d is here, in a portion of the amazing explanation of the cross written 400 years before Jesus died on the cross (emphasis mine). Isaiah 53. 3He was despised and rejected by men,a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;and as one from whom men hide their faceshe was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4Surely he has borne our griefsand carried our sorrows;yet we esteemed him stricken,smitten by God, and afflicted.5But he was pierced for our transgressions;he was crushed for our iniquities;upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,and with his wounds we are healed.6All we like sheep have gone astray;we have turned\u2014every one\u2014to his own way;and the LORD has laid on himthe iniquity of us all. 7He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,yet he opened not his mouth;like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,so he opened not his mouth.8By oppression and judgment he was taken away;and as for his generation, who consideredthat he was cut off out of the land of the living,stricken for the transgression of my people?9And they made his grave with the wickedand with a rich man in his death,although he had done no violence,and there was no deceit in his mouth. 10Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;he has put him to grief;when his soul makes an offering for guilt,he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.11Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,make many to be accounted righteous,and he shall bear their iniquities. Similar to the \u201chealing\u201d properties of wormwood (mugwort), claimed here, the cup that Christ drank, the \u201cdrinking wormwood\u201d that is referred to in the Bible is how one deals with the problem of suffering and evil in the world. Are you going to drink the cup for yourself? For those who prefer to disregard the great thing Christ did, that bitter cup awaits at death when you face the Judgment of God, who does not grade on a curve. Or are you willing to let Christ drink that cup for you, taking on himself the anguish and grief for a lifetime of sin. ",

            "answer_text": "I have sung this hymn for decades, and never really thought about the phrase. I just sort of glossed over it thinking it was probably a reference to the drink Jesus was given on the cross: vinegar mixed with gall. But there is no reference to wormwood at that time, nor to vinegar in the hymn; so . . . no. I have not found any good explanation of the term (and I guess you didn\u2019t either). This is my shot at it: Wormwood is a bitter herb, and gall is a bitter drink, and the term \u201cwormwood and gall\u201d occurs frequently in the Bible to mean \u201cbitterness.\u201d E.g. Lamentations 3:19 \u201cRemember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.\u201d I suspect that the meaning of \u201cSinners, whose love can ne\u2019er forget the wormwood and the gall,\u201d means \u201cYou who share the love of Christ\u2019s redemption but cannot forget the bitterness of your former sins.\u201d But I would not argue against a better interpretation. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll see if I can find a better answer. ",

            "answer_text": "*See Darlene's answer about wormwood.* Gall is a drink made with vinegar. I think it was mixed with wine. Drinking it made a crucified person feel less suffering, but it tasted disgusting. If you have seen The Passion of the Christ, there is a scene where wine is soaked in a sponge, and the sponge is put on a spear, and Jesus tries to drink it, and he sort of rejects it. That\u2019s gall that he is drinking. See 0:41\u20131:18 of the video below:  Hope that helps! :) ",
