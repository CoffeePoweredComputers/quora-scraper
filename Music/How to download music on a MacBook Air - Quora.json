            "answer_text": "Apple makes it easy for users to listen to music on their devices. You should join Apple Music; a service that gives you access to millions of music files. It\u2019s a subscription service that costs $9.99 per month. You can download files directly from the app. Plus, the iTunes store still lives. It\u2019s in the Apple Music app. Even if you\u2019re not subscribed to that service, you can still download music. Of course; you\u2019ll have to pay for it. But when people ask how to download music on a MacBook, they usually seek free alternatives. Here are my suggestions: Explore Jamendo and Soundcloud. These are free services, which feature music that was made available by artists. Both services are completely legit.You can use a file converter, which turns YouTube videos into downloadable music files. That\u2019s in the \u201cgrey\u201d area so I won\u2019t give you direct instructions. But you can search the web and you\u2019ll easily find out how it works.",
