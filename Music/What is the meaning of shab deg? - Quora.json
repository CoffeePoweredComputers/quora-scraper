            "answer_text": "Shab means \u201cNight\u201d and Deg means \u201clarge cooking utensil\u201d. In Kashmir Shab Deg is a special dish. It is very rare even in Kashmir. Not many Kashmiris are aware of the dish and if you ask anyone in Kashmir, they most likely won't know about it. However the dish was once very popular but over the centuries it lost its popularity and was reduced to certain families or areas. It is Chicken cooked in turnips with a lot of spices left to simmer all night. However one can use mutton or even beef instead of chicken. However among Kashmiris, chicken is preferred. It is served cold and reheating it is an absolute no. The spices in it are too overpowering when heated. It is a spicy but mildly sweet dish. This makes it among a few Kashmiri dishes not to have salty taste. I basically grew up eating it all my life however i thought everyone in Kashmir eats it until in my college days i realised that there are very few people in Kashmir who have any information about it or it's existence.
