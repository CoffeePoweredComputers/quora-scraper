            "answer_text": "If you live in an apartment there are quiet hours between 10 pm and 6 am. You or your neighbors are not to disturb the other tenants during this time. I don\u2019t know if there is an additional law for street noise, such as car stereos and such but there is a distance for car stereos. If the law enforcement says they can hear it from a certain distance (I think it is something like half a block away) that is too loud and they can ask you to turn it down or off and will most likely site that person for disturbing the peace.

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can blast your speakers si the qalls shake but inly til 11pm and no later than 11pm or you may have the police at your door or your landlord if you're living in a building or basemen apartment. .Loud noise is permitted during the hours of 7 am til 11pm and that includes loud music.I used ti come home from work and blast my stereo with led zeppelin, Rush, Van Halen and Kiss, sometimes ac/dc and i can recall a time when my dad drove onto my street and heard my music from the end of the street but i think he qas more less worried about losing the respect of his neighbours.If you have a good stereo with kick ass speakers you rock those speakers and enjoy your music but keep in mind that you can only play loud music from 7 am til 11 pm and then it's lights out and bed time.
