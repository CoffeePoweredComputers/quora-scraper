            "answer_text": "In One Piece, a lot of the characters are portrayed with the idea that there are shades of grey, and not everything is black and white. There a lot of characters in one piece who have done wicked things, but even some of them became friends of the main character. The characters who are truly evil are the ones who lack substance or reason for their diabolical actions, or their reason is behind it is downright evil. They are also the ones who are so far gone, that it is impossible to see any change in them, but they also have control over their actions. Then again, in One Piece, Evil is in the eye of the beholder. Usually, the character won't be even remotely redemptive. Okay, moving on, here are (in my opinion) the evilest characters In One Piece. Black Beard  Everything this guy does is based on the saying \u201cYou only live once so just go fucking nuts.\u201d Basically, everything this guy does is for pleasure, and he has a very fucked up view of what pleasure is. He is the kind of guy who will rape someone, then kill them, then go for round two with their corpse. He is absolutely sick and delves in the joy of degrading a person even while they are dead, and everyone else around him trying to mourn the body has to watch in shock and horror while he defiles and humiliates the dead. None of it seems to mean anything to him other than \u201cit\u2019s fun.\u201d Donquixote Doflamingo  This guy was born evil. It's probably due to inbreeding. It seems like something celestial dragons would have in their history. When he was a child, Doflamingo murdered his own father in cold blood, and he had always looked down on others due to his upbringing. No matter what his father did to try and teach him do be better, it never worked. So as he grew up, he spent his life massacring and destroying whole cities. This guy has killed millions. Then he tricked a whole country into believing he was their savior and they made him their king. Little did they know that he had planned mass genocide from the start, and even puppeteered the massacre from before he became king as well. He killed his own brother, and in the process ruined the entire future of a small child. This guy is rotten to the core, and no matter how \u201cprotective\u201d he is of his \u201cfamily\u201d he is still beyond saving. I don't think his care for them is very deep anyway. In other words, he definitely wouldn't hesitate to shoot one of them like he did his brother if it was necessary. God Enel/Eneru  This guy was just chilling with his homies one day. One of them said, \u201cHey man whachu wanna do today dawg?\u201d Eneru here replies. \u201cI'm gonna be a motherfuckin God man.\u201d Then his friend says. \u201cAight.\u201d So Eneru destroys everything and kills his whole family. Then he goes on a trip to a kingdom in the sky, and he does exactly what he said he was going to do. He tosses out so many Ls that the puny Skypeians grovel and beg for mercy, and he proclaims himself their new God. As their God, he does nothing but unleash his wrath upon them. If anyone does anything that is against his rule or his wishes he will smite them with a mighty lightning strike. He's like Zeus but way crueler. Everything he does has no true purpose accept to be catered to and treated like he is above all. He has a massive god complex and he can not stand the idea of anyone being greater than him. Higuma  This guy was like Eneru, but super weak. He was a complete joke actually. He did horrible things because he killed some people and had a \u201c high\u201d bounty (please). So he treated others like shit, was disrespectful to everyone, and tried to sell a child. Then he changed his mind and tried to murder the little boy by drowning him. Luckily the dick died screaming like a bitch. Don Krieg  This guy infuriates me to the core. He ruined an otherwise very good arc. It's just that everything about him is so ugly, and he is incredibly stupid. He thinks that he is \u201cthe strongest guy ever,\u201d even after being brutally bested by Mihawk. He lost all of his ships of 5,000 men except for one and he couldn't even handle the grand line. Yet he still had the audacity to be so damn sure of himself. I saw this as an indirect insult to Mihawk, who took time out of his life, actually stopped taking a nap, to actually challenge this utter fool. Not only is this guy an absolute, self-centered idiot, but he is also a disrespectful coward. He attacked the restaurant where his crew had been fed on the brink of starvation. He attempted to kill his most loyal crewmate because he couldn't kill the one man who fed every single one of them. Oh and he just kept pulling weapons out of his ass and used cowardice and deceit as a battle tactic. Then this pompous douche was easily throttled by a \u2018puny little rubber boy.\u2019 This guy lacked every bit of substance, boasted so much about how strong, and invincible he was and killed people just to prove himself as a scary guy or whatever. He turned out to be super fucking weak. Vinsmoke Judge  This asshole, experimented on his own wife to make his own flesh and blood into military weapons. Well kudos to him, he succeeded. Accept for one failed \u2018experiment' who he refused to call his son, abused him physically and mentally, neglected him, caged the poor child, and even taught his successful \u2018experiments\u2019 how to humiliate and bully him as well. He never really even cared for them either. They are things to him, weapons are all they are. He wouldn't hesitate to be rid of them either if they showed any signs of failure. Oh and apparently, this monster has \u201cfeelings.\u201d yeah, feelings for himself. He only cried for his own pathetic ass. I would put his atrocities on this list as well but Sanji and Reiju are walking, breathing proof that there might be some hope for them. They are all victims of Judge after all. Rob Lucci  Lucci has a reason for what he does. That reason is that he believes in dark justice. Okay, but why does he believe in dark justice? Well, it's actually because it's an excuse for him to kill because he is a psychopath who is incredibly bloodthirsty. So far he has shown zero signs of redemption or change of mind. The closest I can find is that he seems to avoid hurting women when it isn't necessary. In fact, I have only seen him assassinate targets in general. Other than that he is a ruthless killing machine with a manifold of bodies on his trail, and his only reason for doing so is because he loves it. Spandam  Spandam is evil because he is really weak. He feels like he has to inflict pain and humiliation on others to make him seem stronger. He has gone so far as to beat the shit out of Nico Robin for no reason, then he gave permission to Rob Lucci to do the same (he did no such thing). It's funny that he does such horrible things to no avail. No matter how much power he tries to have he always looks like an utter fool. Caesar Clown  Caesar is very selfish with all of his actions. He has done horrible things to innocent people and has had no remorse or guilt toward them. Nor has he ever been redemptive. He has kidnapped children, stolen them from their families, and experimented on them. He would give them \u201ccandy\u201d which was actually a drug that would give them terrible headaches if they didn't have it all the time. So he also abused them. He also produced a toxic gas that put the lives of everyone in danger and was involved with the distribution of a horribly inhumane industrial devil fruit. Vander Decken  Vander Decken is a disgusting creep who preyed on an underage girl starting from the age of six up to the age of sixteen. He did it all for power because she could communicate with Sea Kings, but he didn't just try to use her. He became obsessed with a child, wanted to marry her, and would send love letters and even tried to kill her if she refused to marry him. Then he proceeded to try and annihilate her by projecting a giant ship at her and nearly destroying Fishman Island in the process. Kaidou  Kaido is a truly terrifying force of nature. He took over an entire nation to produce a devil fruit that stripped away the sorrow of anyone who failed to gain the ability it grants, and the chances of gaining it are slim. The pollution from his factories caused devastating famine for the majority of the nation he runs because it poisoned their food and water supply. Kaido is so savage that he is willing to brutalize a little girl to get what he wants. He just turns into a ferocious dragon and rampages, killing anyone and not caring at all just so he can find Luffy and have a one on one with him. Orochi  This guy is the lowest of scum. He would have someone executed just for spilling a drop of saki on his rug. He has an entire nation wrapped around his finger because he is a tyrant. He is actually an ugly ass idiot who only enjoys inflicting misery. When this piglet gets bored, which is way too often, he loves to see other people in pain and under his control. He also seems to get overly giddy with torturing humans when he gets the chance to. He expects everyone to respect him and has no respect at all for anyone in return. He seems to lack every bit of sense and rational thought. He is also a sniveling coward who dishes out what he can't take. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good one. I\u2019ll probably go with this: #1 Blackbeard: Teach\u2019s actions literally shook the balance of power in the world. By capturing Ace, it led to the Summit War that ended up getting both Ace and Whitebeard killed. Before that, he used his Shichibukai status to take prisoners from Level 6 of Impel Down to join his crew. After the Summit War, he took all of Whitebeard\u2019s territories, decimated the remaining forces of the Whitebeard Pirates in the Payback War, went around taking devil fruit powers from previous DF users, and took on Yonko status all while having a bounty of zero. How he went that whole time without getting a bounty even after using the World Government speaks volumes. #2 Shiryu: This guy was the Warden of Impel Down before Magellan took over. He would abuse his authority by attacking prisoners for no reason *and* even his own subordinates. Some of the members of Blackbeard\u2019s crew don\u2019t even trust him and Shiryu doesn\u2019t (initially) trust Teach. He would just kill to kill and feel no remorse over it and I have a feeling that he\u2019s only gonna get worse since being a part of Yonko Blackbeard\u2019s crew will only enable him to do more terrible things and maybe even attempt to overthrow his new captain. #3 Enel: This guy destroyed his home island because he wanted to, took over Skypiea, badly injured or killed anyone who spoke out against him, used his henchmen to reach the moon, and proceeded to take over the people on the moon once he reached it. He\u2019s even possibly going to return to Earth and cause even more damage. The only one at the time that had a chance to beat him was Luffy because of his rubber body. Of course, he can be taken out by New World pirates and upper tier Marines and government agents, but he\u2019s still pure evil. #4 Akainu: Boy, this guy\u2019s views on justice are warped. When delivering justice, you would think that it\u2019s punishing those who have done harm on the innocent and keeping casualties to an absolute minimum. Akainu throws all of that out of the window. He destroyed an evacuation ship with innocent civilians and fellow Marine soldiers on it during a Buster Call so that a single scholar from Ohara wouldn\u2019t possibly escape. He attacked fellow Marines during the war, including killing two of them who abandoned their posts and nearly killing Coby before Shanks arrived and saved him. He manipulated Squard to stab Whitebeard and irritated Ace enough to make him turn around from escaping knowing what made Ace tick and ultimately ended up killing him. Sakazuki is also the only one in the series so far to completely break Luffy\u2019s spirit. He then hounded Luffy to the remainder of the Marineford arc after killing Ace believing that certain bloodlines shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live and that their very existence will endanger the world. Even Ace told Garp that there would be those that wouldn\u2019t except them if they had become Marines and Akainu proved that Ace was right. We still don\u2019t know his involvement in what caused Jewelry Bonnet to hate the WG, but from her reaction, it couldn\u2019t have been anything good. When he beat Aokiji in their 10-day bout, he nearly killed him despite suffering serious wounds himself. Once he became the new Fleet Admiral, he moved Marine HQ to the New World all for the sole purpose of finding and killing Luffy along with his father. Of course there are other notable pirates for him to catch, but those are his main targets. I honestly should put him higher than he is, but I reserve that he has more humanity (believe it or not) than the previous 3 above. #5 Spandam: I hated this guy more than his own father who spearheaded the Ohara Buster Call. This guy here got Tom the Shipwright, and Franky\u2019s mentor, killed and even has the nerve to use the train that Tom built to travel back and forth on. He also ran Franky over with that same train just adding insult to injury. He then tortured waifu Robin during the Enies Lobby arc and arrogantly ordered around CP9 agents who could easily mop the floor with him and most certainly would do it if he wasn\u2019t their superior at the time. To top it all off, he tried to place the failure of the mission all on CP9 and ordered the Marines to capture them. Seeing Robin constantly slap him then break his back in revenge along with Rob Lucci and his team become Spandam\u2019s superior two years later was all too satisfying. There may be someone else that shows up in One Piece that\u2019ll change this list, but this what I\u2019ll go with for now. ",
