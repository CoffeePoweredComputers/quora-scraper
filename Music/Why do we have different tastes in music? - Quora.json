            "answer_text": "At least some of our music preference is cultural. Certain combinations of sounds may be more common in particular geographic regions. Lifelong familiarity with these patterns would be a reason to prefer them In a tiny study the babies of musical mothers , several infants were placed backstage during the performance of the mothers. In each case the baby most soothed was the one currently listening to music played by its own mother. The music played by other musicians were not as effective. Consider that each infant had already spent several months during gestation listening to the music of its own mom (as well as its mom's voice and heart beat. ) .All of these auditory inputs were familiar and calming to the baby. Nim Tottenham studied musical preferences of kids who were born in 1990. She went through the \"Hit Parade\" and selected songs which were on the \u201c top of the charts\u201d during the time these kids were 7 yrs old (For her group, the number one tune in the USA was by the Backstreet Boys). In 2012, when these kids were 22, she looked musical preferences (and emotional comfort- defined by biorhythms) while listening to various songs from different eras- including those which were on the charts when these subjects were children That music experienced by these subjects when they were children had the greatest capacity to reduce anxiety at the point in life when they were 22 yrs old. Tottenham's explanation is that, in early childhood, before the higher brain networks are developed, learning is much more driven by emotions. So musical experiences acquired at that time would be more emotional than cognitive. (Note: this was not true among age matched peers who were raised in other countries and did not grow up listening to the Backstreet Boys. Those newcomers preferred songs which were popular when they first arrived in the USA . Another feature which shapes our musical preferences is influence of peers . Every generation seems to have its own music that the older generation \"doesn't understand\". Young people introduce each other to different musical styles and bond around their own brand of music- Of course, this answer doesn't explain why some people like Rap music while others in the same social circles might hate it.

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a very large, general example, gleaned from the little I know of music cognition. It\u2019s fairly well established that intervals (harmony) with simple pitch relations (like the 2:3 frequency ratio of a perfect fifth) cause creation of endorphins in the brain through stimulation of the stirrup and anvil in the middle ear. This encourages calm and a general feeling of well-being. Music with more complex ratios (dissonance, high harmonics, etc.) has the opposite effect, stimulating the creation of adrenaline, which cranks you up. Now, if you WANT to be calmed, the first choice is what you might like. If you are bored and want some excitement, the first choice would simply irritate you. Same for the second choice. If you want action, the second choice will be right for you, while the same music will drive you crazy if you just want some peace and quiet. I haven\u2019t even gotten into the cultural markers and the effects of early exposure to different styles of music, and what certain things in music \u201cmean\u201d to a listener. Nor have I even gotten started on intellect, and how some listeners want a challenge while others don\u2019t. But there are so many aspects to this question that I\u2019m not convinced that we will ever know all the answers. For the moment, I\u2019m happy that so many different people have different tastes, and at different times of the day or different times in their lives, that it encourages a wide variety of music to be created for our perusal. If you are interested in the question, a good book that discusses many of these things is \u201cThis Is Your Brain On Music\u201d by Daniel Levitin. This Is Your Brain on Music - Wikipedia ",
