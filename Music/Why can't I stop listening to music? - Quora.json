            "answer_text": "There are a lot of reasons why I always listen to music but they all have one thing in common. I\u2019ll let you try to figure it out. Because it makes my ears happy. Seriously. This is probably the main reason.Because it helps my brain focus on something while I\u2019m doing other things, like browse Quora for example.Because I\u2019m bored. And when I listen to music I\u2019m not bored. I\u2019m doing something very productive.Because I\u2019m addicted. I listen so much that when I stop listening I feel empty. I need the high.It helps me wake up. I can\u2019t get out of my bed at an early hour without music.It helps me work out. There\u2019s no chance of me working out without music.I love my AirPods. I don\u2019t even know why. But who knows the reason for love anyway? I just love putting them on and listening to magic.I listen to a lot of Rock music. It helps me feel my inner beast so that\u2019s another reason.It distracts me from real life. Which doesn\u2019t necessarily suck, but you know, distractions are awesome.The last reason is because I learn from the music. A lot of things. But one of the things is that it teaches me about songs and I like composing songs. Even when I go hiking I\u2019m listening. It\u2019s so awesome. Thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a reason. It is addiction. There are several types of this need. The ear is attached to a specific part of the brain. The only thing that activates the neurological pathways is sound being recieved by the tiny hairs inside the ear and the cone, we see as an ear, itself. That's right the ear itself hears too. This electrical stimulation reaches nearly every other part of the brain. This is the only known way to spark the entire brain. It causes a chemical release to hear. Certain chemicals, released into the brain by the brain, in abundance can cause fear, anxiety, nervousness, joy, euphoria, and others. Many of these extreme emotions are addictive. Another thing to keep in mind is the amount of scale patterns that have been created and utilized to evoke these emotions, as well as the manipulative practice taking in the background of the things we view. It has all been studied heavily and used formulaicly by many, without the average subject knowing. Now you know. You should think about this next time you feel. How much is from the sounds you are experiencing? ",
