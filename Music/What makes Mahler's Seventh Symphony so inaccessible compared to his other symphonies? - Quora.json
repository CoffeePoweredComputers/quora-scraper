            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t understand why a work like Mahler\u2019s Seventh Symphony would be considered inaccessible. Schoenberg\u2019s Moses und Aron is inaccessible; Mahler\u2019s Seventh is just a bit formless and rambling, that\u2019s all. But the Seventh\u2019s got glory and charm and wonder. And Mahler coaxes both brilliant and original sounds out of the orchestra, particularly those marvellous woodwind timbres. It\u2019s a work that lacks clear form and symmetry, yet Mahler\u2019s voice is so compelling throughout. But I like architecture that is just rambling genius lacking symmetry, too. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess its a result of the transition from the more conventional 5th and 6th style to that of the 9th (and 10th fragment) (with the 8th in-between being an outlier), which connects Mahler to Schoenberg and the atonal movement. Also, consider that a lot of Mahler reception depends on interpretation, and given there are so many other pieces of Mahler which have been underappreciated over decades and represented low hanging fruits for re-discovery, there was little incentive to try it with this difficult one. I think the interpretation problem though has been fixed at least since the 70ties, and you can find very good recordings of the 7th, but still rarely live performances. For me the 7th is one of my favorites. You just have to hear it often enough :-) ",

Mahler seems to be one of those composers people either \u201cget\u201d him or they don\u2019t. I will admit, I have to force myself to pay attention when I listen to Mahler, he seems to go off-track or get distracted, and then my mind starts wandering, and I have to pinch myself to stay focused on where he\u2019s going and what he\u2019s doing with his material.
