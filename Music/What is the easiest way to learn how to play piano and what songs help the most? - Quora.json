            "answer_text": "Playing any musical instrument takes time, dedication and practice. There has never existed \u201can easy way\u201d to learn an instrument. First, you need to know the theory of music. For children this is always a challenge, but older students should always learn the \u201crules\u201d before attempting a discipline, just as you would a sporting activity. Second. You need to give attention to scales, broken chords and arpeggios. If you understand the theory behind them, then executing them with understanding will help you grow as a performing musician. These exercises are not there just to loosen, encourage independent finger dexterity and strengthen your fingers. These drills are especially important if you are attempting to learn popular music in record time. Song choice. Once you have a firm grasp of the theory, many popular pieces become exactly what they are, a series of chords referred to as a chord progression, with a \u201cnice\u201d melody thrown in. If you are learning classical, there are an abundance of graded books to choose from. Even if you are learning popular piano, I would urge you to learn from these books as well. They can speed up the development of finger dexterity, and encourage you to become more than just a \u201cchord basher\u201d. Rest assured, there exists no easy method, no quick fix, no short-cut. A strong foundation is always a good thing, so I encourage you to find a teacher to groom you in theory and posture. The stronger your foundation, the farther you will go. Best of luck. ",
