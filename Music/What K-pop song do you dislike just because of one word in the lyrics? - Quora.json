            "answer_text": "I only dislike one K-pop song, which is 'War Of Hormones' by- BTS The song is about teenager boys who are in love with a girl and they say very uncomfortable things. I have only chosen some parts which makes me feel really uncomfortable. \u201cWomen wear things that make me cough cough, see right through, see right through (Very much) thank you! For improving my eye sight My eyes keep turning to the girls (yup) Women are like an equation, us guys are the solution (yup) Wear them more, your high heels I\u2019m 18, I know what I need to know That women are the best in the world Yes I\u2019m a bad boy so i like bad girl Come here baby, we\u2019re gonna hit it off My testosterone heavily shows up After winning a war of hormones I\u2019ll do some research, your existence is against the rules, a foul If the standard of beauty is in the ocean, you\u2019re the deep ocean A mini cultural asset that should be taken care of on a national level Her hair, body, waist, legs, even her other unspeakable parts If anyone says he\u2019s not interested in them, I\u2019d be surprised as a man The tiniest gestures make me lose it Girl, your temptations make me sit at my computer every night. (Looking at her profile)\u201d As a fangirl, I hate this lyrics and for that I even thought of leaving BTS fandom. All fangirl find this uncomfortable. ",
