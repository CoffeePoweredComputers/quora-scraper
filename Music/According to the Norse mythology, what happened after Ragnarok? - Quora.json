            "answer_text": "Before I answer your question truly, I wish to start off with a passage from a book I read: The Norse Myths by Kevin Crossley-Holland, I will post a summary and discussion afterwards: \u201cThe earth will rise again out of the water, fair and green. The eagle will fly over cataracts, swoop into the thunder and catch fish under crags.Corn will ripen in fields that were never sown. Vidar and Vali will still be alive; they will survive the fire and the flood and make their way back to Idavoll, the shining plain where palaces once stood. Modi and Magni, sons of Thor, will join them there, Hod will come back from the world of the dead; it will not be long before they, too, thread the new green grass on Idavoll. Honir will be there as well, and he will hold the wand and foretell what is to come. The sons of Vili and Ve will make up the new number, the gods in heaven, home of the winds. They will sit down and begin to talk. Turn by turn, they will call up such memories, memories such as are known to them alone. They will talk over many things that happened in the past, and the evil of Jormungand and the wolf Fenrir. And then, amongst waving grass, they will find golden chessboards, treasures owned once by the Aesir, and gaze at them in wonder. Many courts will rise once more, some good, some evil. The best place of all will be Gimli in heaven, a building fairer than the sun, roofed with gold. That is where the rulers will live, at peace with themselves and each other. Then there will be Brimir and Okolnir, where the ground is always warm underfoot; there will always be plenty of good drink there for those who have a taste for it. And there will be Sindri, a fine hall that stands in the dark mountains of Nidafjoll, made wholly of red gold. Good men will live in these places. But there will be another hall on Nastrond, the shore of corpses. That place in the underworld will be as vile as it is vast; all its doors will face north. Its walls and roof will be made of wattled snakes, their heads facing inward, blowing so much poison that it runs in rivers through the halls. Oath breakers and murderers and philanderers will wade through those rivers. Nidhogg, too, will outlive the fire and the flood and under Yggdrasill he will suck blood from the bodies of the dead. The two humans who hid themselves deep within Yggdrasill - some say Hoddmimir\u2019s Wood - will be called Lif and Lifthrasir. Surt\u2019s fire will not scorch them; it will not even touch them, and their food will be the morning dew. Through the branches, through the leaves, they will see light come back, for before the sun is caught and eaten by the wolf Skoll, she will give birth to a daughter no less fair than herself, who will follow the same sky-path and light the world. Lif and Lifthrasir will have children, their children will bear children. There will be life and new life, life everywhere on earth. That was the end; and this is the beginning.\u201d Now, for the TL;DR: Some of the Gods will survive Ragnarok, one of them survives it because he\u2019s in the land of the dead: Niflheim.Two humans will survive Ragnarok, by hiding in the world tree Yggdrasill, they will become the forefathers of all new humans.There will be three halls:Gimli: Heaven, so to speak, a lovely longhouse filled to the brim with alcohol, where it\u2019s always warm and where rulers are at peace with themselves and others.Sindri: A hall made of red gold, it\u2019s the place where normal men will go.Nastrond: Hell, so to speak, a nasty place where the bad people drown in poison and where their blood will be drunk by the dragon Nidhogg (Which means \u201cCorpse Tearer\u201d).Discussion: There are a couple of reasons that this answer is not satisfying to me: It\u2019s a tertiary source, because it was written by Kevin Crossley-Holland who used secondary sources made by Snorri Sturlusson, who supposedly used primary sources (which we will never be able to confirm, sadly).Snorri Sturlusson was a Catholic poet, so it\u2019s hard to know for certain that this is what the original mythology said. I\u2019m most upset about the similarities to the Adam and Eve story. This might be coincidental (which is likely, due to the fact that a lot of mythologies had similarities like this), but it might also be influenced by Snorri\u2019s own beliefs.So what happens after Ragnarok? Like with all bad things that happen to Humanity, life continues, just without some of the folks that were important in the beginning. ",

It ends when the fire giants battle the gods and goddesses. What happens next is a variation on what happened before. There is another cycle. The Volspa tells what would happen if Odin did nothing. Once he hears the story he goes on an nearly endless quest to change the outcome. The story in the Volspa tells of a next cycle that is better according to the dead seeeress, but not according to Odin. That\u2019s why he arranges for his son Balder to survive the final battle to be in charge the next cycle. What we know of the next cycle is it won\u2019t be as described in the Volspa because of Odin\u2019s constant work. ",
