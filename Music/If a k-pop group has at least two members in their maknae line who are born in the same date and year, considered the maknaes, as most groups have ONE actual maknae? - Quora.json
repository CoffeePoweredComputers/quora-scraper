            "answer_text": "Yes but also no, don\u2019t worry i have an example. Here is Cravity, a nine member boy group under Starship entertainment.  they have 2 members who were born in the same year. Kim Taeyoung was born January 27th, 2003 and Ahn Seongmin was born August 1st, 2003. he just turned 17 yesterday but in korean age he and Taeyoung have both been 18 this year.  most of the time people recognize Seongmin as the maknae as he is, technically, the youngest but whenever they are on variety shows or anything comes up they are referred to as \u201cthe maknaes\u201d so yes it is possible to have more than one maknae in a group but if you think about it scientifically the younger one would be the maknae because maknae means \u201cyoungest\u201d but like Seongmin would never call Taeyoung \u201chyung\u201d. so if one was born at 5:15 and the other was born at 5:20 it would still work out as my example shows.

            "answer_text": "So if they\u2019re twins, they usually know who\u2019s older/younger, so my guess is, whoever is the youngest is the true maknae. Or they could just simply refer to them as \u201cthe maknaes\u201d. If they aren\u2019t twins\u2026I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see if/when that happens since that\u2019s already uncommon for two people in a group to have the same birthday, let alone be born in the exact same day/year (who aren\u2019t twins). The only group I know of who had 2 members born on the exact same day/year was I.O.I\u2019s Doyeon and Mina, but they weren\u2019t the youngest (though they were the 2nd/3rd youngest). Anyways, a position like the maknae isn\u2019t THAT important or pivotal that we need to be racking our brains over what would happen if 2 people born on the exact same day are the youngest \ud83e\udd23.
