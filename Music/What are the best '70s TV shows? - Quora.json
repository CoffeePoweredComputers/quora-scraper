            "answer_text": "Without googling, the first show to come to mind is:   Hilarious show. Stealing lines from IMDB (which doesn\u2019t do the actual scenes justice): Arthur 'Big Guy' Carlson: As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly. - Reporter: And the senator, while insisting he was not intoxicated, could not explain his nudity. - Venus Flytrap: [Fever runs into the booth and hides behind the coat rack] What are you doin', man! I'm on the air! Dr. Johnny Fever: Herb Tarlek is selling life insurance! Venus Flytrap: Oh, no! Close the blinds before he sees us! Andy Travis: [Walks into the booth] What have I told you guys about goofing off when one of you is supposed to be on the air? Dr. Johnny Fever: Herb Tarlek is selling life insurance! Andy Travis: Oh, no! [slams the door and hides with Fever] - Dr. Johnny Fever: Do you have enough money to feed yourself? Les Nessman: Yes. Dr. Johnny Fever: I don't, can you loan me some money? Les Nessman: No. Dr. Johnny Fever: Can you loan me some food? - Jennifer Marlowe: Mr. Craven I would like to ask you a question about the phone company. Wayne Craven: Well that's what I'm here for, fire away. Jennifer Marlowe: You know the phone company won't give you a specific time when they'll come to install your phone. You have to wait all day long. Like most people, I work and can't take the whole day off. Wayne Craven: Uh-Hunh. Jennifer Marlowe: So Saturday is the only day I'll be here. But because so many other people have the same problem, you can wait up to two, three weeks or more for service. Wayne Craven: That's correct. Jennifer Marlowe: Could you tell me why that is? Wayne Craven: Of course, it's like that because we don't have any competition. - [Venus is showing off his flashy wardrobe] Venus Flytrap: I only came downtown to have one of my suits serviced. Dr. Johnny Fever: I'll bet a suit like that stays in the shop most of the time. Venus Flytrap: I got suits I can't get parts for. - Les Nessman: [repeated sign-off line] This is Les Nessman saying good day, and may the good news be yours. - [after an elderly couple has broken into the DJ booth] Dr. Johnny Fever: All right, you two, up against the wall! I don't what you want but you should know I've killed a lot of old people in my time. And I'm not above doing it again. - Les Nessman: Last night at that house, did anything happen? Jennifer Marlowe: I met a lady whose car I have to replace and I discovered we have a sex pervert in the neighborhood. Les Nessman: No, I mean did anything unusual happen? - [Johnny is lying to keep from being beaten up by a big thug named Dave] Dr. Johnny Fever: I'm Andy Travis, glad to meet you, (pointing to the real Andy Travis) that's my brother Randy and that's old Venus of course. Venus Flytrap: Of course. Dr. Johnny Fever: [referring to Dave] We don't know who the mountainoid is. Dave: Name's Dave. - Herb Tarlek: It's bad luck to take advice from a crazy person.  Then I looked up other 70\u2019s shows via google and found some other of my favorites:  I\u2019m starting to watch some of these episodes again, actually. One scene where Nick Yamano was stoned from eating some tainted brownies. Stumbles up to Barney and says \u201chey Barney\u2026 let\u2019s go down to the beach and shoot some clams\u201d.     Great series, though it dragged (got un-funny) over the last few seasons.  At the end of my list, great series, but almost not quite the same level as my prior choices in my answer:  ",

            "answer_text": "Saturday nights were great. All In The Family, followed by Mash, followed by Mary Tyler Moore , followed by The Carol Burnett Show. By that time it was 11pm, and after we laughed our asses off for 3 hours, we'd hit the bars. A few short clips. All of these shows were Emmy winners. All In The Family,  M.A.S.H , one of television\u2019s saddest and most powerful scenes.  Mary Tyler Moore, this scene was rated as tied for television\u2019s funniest scene,  The Carol Burnett Show. Tim Conway and Harvey Korman had a running $50 bet for every scene Conway could make Korman break character. Pretty obvious who won this one.  ",
