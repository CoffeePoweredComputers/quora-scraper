What are some tips and tricks to help focus on studying? Here's my quick response to the thrust of your question. Drawing on my extensive professional coaching experience, I firmly believe that the best way to dedicate yourself to studying is to: set goals;acquire strategy;There are a few important things you can do immediately, and for the longer term to help you to become a focused master student. First things first. At least at the macro-cosmic level, establish compelling, inspiring and overarching long range goals and objectives, broken down into short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspectives, and covering all the major life dimensions, with academic pursuit as your top priority, followed by a systematic game plan, in your life to drive you. With a game plan in place, you can then factor in your learning agenda, or study plan, or even side-gig project plan, if any. But more importantly, with the end in mind, goals, priorities and a plan, set your direction and keep you focused on the things that matter to you the most. Using a military analogy, goals, priorities and a plan, are like precise commands preset into the flight plan of a Tomahawk cruise missile, homing on to a predefined, long-distance target. Secondly, at the micro-cosmic level, learn, acquire and practise proven efficient and effective study and productivity tools to help you navigate you academic journey with ease, expediency, and ace. I have already written extensively about these academic strategies, and the web-links are appended below: Say Keng Lee's answer to How can I get good studying habits?

We can see it will be completely involved in the work it does. Few days back, there was a kid in my home.it was seeing cartoon, in such a way that her mom was scaring her to make it eat food. But, at that moment seeing TV it eat a lot than usual. It's interest was completely on cartoon TV.  We too have such concentrating power but thing is as we grow up our minds get disturbed, distorted, with variety of things. Primary thing is you need to stop seeing thinking talking of unnecessary things. You should do you are supposed to do . have a clarity what you gonna wanto do . find a string motivating moving reason yourself. Think of it always. Follow that path.
