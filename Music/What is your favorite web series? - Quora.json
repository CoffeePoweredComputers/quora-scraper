            "answer_text": "Since many will recommend typical shows like Game of thrones, Breaking Bad, Money Heist, Narcos etc. These are the TV shows which are worth watching :- 5. The 100: This a fantastic series which shows a space station, The Ark, which sends a 100 criminals to a post apocalyptic Earth to see if it\u2019s inhabitable or not because The Ark is dying itself. Although the series started to be less interesting since season 5, I would definitely recommend watching the first 4 seasons.  4. The Originals: This spin-off of The Vampire Diaries is arguably better than it\u2019s parent series itself. It revolves around an Original supernatural family which has a lot of enemies around the world. But the bond and loyalty between the family is what is worth watching in the show. Moreover, Joseph Morgan and Daniel Gillies have done an exceptional job in carrying out the role.  3. Vikings: If you are looking to watch a man gaining riches, power, popularity, and some exceptional writing, you should definitely watch the first 4 seasons of Vikings. The show revolves around a famous viking King Ragnar Lothbrok who invades west. The story kind of breaks apart after season 4 due to some bold casting decisions but that doesn\u2019t mean the first 4 seasons aren\u2019t binge worthy.  2. The Expanse: This sci-fi thriller is debated to be better than Battlestar Galectica itself. Politics, conspiracies, space, creepy weird aliens, you name it\u2026 This show has got it all. It is set in the future where Mars is invaded by the best of Mankind and they form their own independent country in Mars starting tensions between the two planets.  1. The Man In The High Castle: Set in a fictional world where Nazis and the Japanese have won the world war II and are sharing the territory of the USA. This show has excellent casting and truly fantastic writing. Although the series was cancelled and the end was rushed, the show just keeps making you want more and more. The show has also got sci-fi elements like alternate universe and keeps you wondering for what\u2019s gonna happen next.  ",

            "answer_text": "If I had to select my favourite three these would be it 1. Stranger Things A throwback and love letter to the early 1980s movies of Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, the Duffer Brothers stranger things feels both familiar and new. The first season is about a boy named Will (think E.T.\u2018s Elliot) who is captured by a The Thing-like creature and trapped in a Poltergeist-like world. His mother (Winona Ryder) recruits the local sheriff to investigate Will\u2019s disappearance. Meanwhile, Will\u2019s dorky, Goonies-like best friends take to their bikes to do some sleuthing of their own and eventually befriend an alien-like girl with telepathic powers (the E.T. of the series). The investigation into Will\u2019s disappearance and the arrival of the telepathic girl all seem to lead back to a power plant operated by a character played by Matthew Modine. It\u2019s great PG horror/sci-fi, like the blockbusters of the early \u201980s, but for those who didn\u2019t grow up in the era or aren\u2019t intimately familiar with Amblin Entertainment\u2019s catalog, the series may not hold as much appeal. 2. Orange is the New Black Jenji Kohan\u2019s knack for social commentary mixed with humor is perfect for a prison story. Orange Is the New Black is as funny as Weeds in its early years, but Kohan has found a way to infuse poignancy to the overall vibe of her stories. The diverse, engaging ensemble cast is chock-full of fan favorites, and while Orange is the New Black traffics in stereotypes, it also challenges and complicates them. The acting is superb, the writing is brilliant, and the storylines are addictive. More importantly, it forces us to root for people who make poor decisions and appreciate the fact that we all make poor decisions because we\u2019re human. The series will make viewers laugh and think, and every once in a while, it will break viewers\u2019 hearts. It is a smart show, but most of all, it is good, in every sense of the word. 3. Sex Education Following in the footsteps of Nick Kroll\u2019s Big Mouth, this British teem comedy is committed to exploring all of the cringe-worthy, taboo topic associated with sex, just not in animated form. The series follows a mother-son duo navigating their way through those uncomfortable \u201ctalks.\u201d Of course, the mother here happens to be a sex therapist named Dr. Jean Milburn (a terrific Gillian Anderson) and her son Otis (Asa Butterfield) is the kid enduring her overbearing tendencies at home while doling out sex advice of his own in an underground sex therapy ring amongst his friends. Sex is a comedy goldmine, and although the show loves to play up \u201980s high-school tropes, there\u2019s real nuance and thought that goes into how these teens are portrayed and their interactions with sex. Plus, Anderson\u2019s comedic timing is spot-on. ",
