            "answer_text": "I kind of feel like this is a no-brainer. I know some people will want to bring hate and say that I hate Blackpink. I stan both of them, mind you. Now let\u2019s get to the actual answer. I feel like it\u2019s clearly BTS. Both groups are amazing, but BTS are more popular for a few reasons (none of these are meant to put BP down, I stan both groups and I\u2019m giving an unbiased answer to this question): They have a bigger fandom. They have 13M monthly listeners on Spotify. They also have 5M users on their Weverse, and 31.8M subscribers on YT. To top that, BTS has 20M followers on V LIVE. That isn\u2019t even all of the ARMYs. There are, of course, ARMYs that don\u2019t have access to any of these or don\u2019t follow/subscribe to these.They have won many awards. They\u2019ve won approximately 221 awards. That\u2019s a lot. Heck, they went to the Grammys. Sadly, they didn\u2019t win a Grammy, but they got the opportunity to perform. That\u2019s big.BTS sell out stadium concerts. I haven\u2019t heard of a BP stadium concert actually selling out. I know YG has lied about that before. But if they do, that\u2019s good for them.BTS has more Spotify streams than BP. BTS is the second most-streamed group under Imagine Dragons. BP hasn\u2019t topped that (I bet they could if they released more music though).Now let\u2019s talk about Blackpink because I\u2019ve talked about BTS enough: Blackpink is probably the most popular girl group. Obviously, BTS is not a girl group. I swear if someone says they\u2019re girls because they wear makeup, I\u2019m going to slam my head into a wall. That\u2019s so sexist to say. Anyway, I can\u2019t think of a girl group that is more popular than BP right now. Of course, that could change.Blackpink\u2019s D4 MV reached 1B views before BTS\u2019s DNA. That\u2019s most likely because Blinks have nothing else to stream. BP has one comeback a year. They have four albums, 3 of them being recordings of BP\u2019s live performances. One is an actual album, but includes songs previously released in singles.Blackpink debuted 3 years after BTS. I\u2019m not expecting BP to have more music than BTS. It just kinda sucks that they don\u2019t release a ton of music. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have lots of music to choose from (not including Japanese versions & live performance recordings), but they really don\u2019t.Blackpink\u2019s label sucks. I\u2019m just going to say it. YG Entertainment has lied about things. And their dumb rule where BP is limited to one comeback a year. Don\u2019t even get me started on the incident with Lisa\u2019s manager.I know the last one didn\u2019t have anything to do with Blackpink\u2019s fame, but it needed to be said. I do not hate either of these groups. I stan both of them, but of course I stan one harder. It\u2019s probably obvious because of my profile pic. But anyway, if you do like my answer upvotes are appreciated <3 I spent a long time writing this and making sure it\u2019s a quality one :) Have a great day & go stream BP\u2019s HYLT + BTS\u2019s Stay Gold! ~Vanessa ",

There are 5 MVs of BTS on the list, and 5 MVs of Blackpink on the list. YouTube video ranking are hard because they are both pretty equal here and because there is not correct way to see it. I calculated it in two ways If I average the ranking: BTS is at 1+4+9+10+11/5 which is 35/5, 17.5. Blackpink is at 2+3+6+7+17/5 which is also at 35/5, 17.5, which means that they are tied.If I average the views: BTS is at 101.1+74.6+46.5+45.9+43.8/5, which is 311.9/5, which is 62.38 M, while Blackpink is at 319.6/5, which is 63.92 M, which is 1.54 M higher, which is a close but a win for BlackpinkI know that some ARMYs may try to claim that because YouTube deleted views from our MVs, this is not fair; however, looking at it officially, Blackpink has been more successful.BTS: 0 BlackPink: 1 Twitter/Most-liked BTSNever Not 2.8 M (no. 8)Army Painted Me 2.6 M (no. 11)Duh 2.4 M (no. 13)\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ucc0d\uc73c\ub2c8\uae4c \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uad6d\uc774 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc62c\ub9ac\ub294 \uc11d\uc9c0\ub2c8 2.3 M (no. 15)\uc548\uacbd 2.3 M (no. 16)\uc544\ubbf8 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uae40\ubc25 \ub9db\uc788\uac8c \uba39\uace0 \uac00\uc694 2.3 M (no. 17)\uc624\ub79c\ub9cc\uc5d0 2.3 M (no. 18)\ud83d\udc9c \ud83e\udd0dARMY \ubcf4\uace0\uc2f6\uc5b4\uc694\ud83e\udd0d \ud83d\udc9c 2.3 M (no. 19)\uc5b4\ub9b0\uc655\uc790\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud55c \uafc0FM \ub2f9\ubd84\uac04 \uc548\ub155~ #0613FM_0606 2.3 M (no. 20)BlackPinkNone, I don\u2019t mean to offend Blinks, I\u2019m a Blink myself, but BlackPink really can\u2019t follow BTS in TwitterBTS has 9 in the Top 20 List while BlackPink does not have one so BTS won in Twitter.
