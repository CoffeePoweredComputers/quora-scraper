            "answer_text": "Mine has to be 11:11 by Taeyeon. The quiet vocals and the beautiful lyrics, listening to it is always a magical experience for me. The imagery of the clock and everything seeming to change while you\u2019re still in the same spot (like how the time always passes but the hands are still circling the centre). It\u2019s very haunting and has a little bit of hope, but currently you\u2019re still stuck trying to move on. I feel like this is a song that works not just with relationships between lovers but with platonic relationships and familial relationships too. The music video is also very simple but so aesthetic and is basically the song translated visually to make a video that perfectly matches the video.   Secondly, Goodbye My Love by Ailee. This can hardly be considered a K-pop song but when it was first released, every time I listened to this song it made me cry - not just tears rolling down cheeks, but full on sobbing with snot. It\u2019s heartbreaking and literally devastating. The emotion Ailee puts into her voice and the lyrics of the song gang up against you to make you feel utter despair. It doesn\u2019t help that the drama and the music video are both so fucking devastating that it just makes you die. Of unhappiness.   I should put in a disclaimer however that both these songs are much better without the music video or the live versions - stick in your earphones or headphones, close your eyes and just listen. I feel like the video clips of them singing or the music video just distracts you from fully experiencing the impact of their voices and the beauty of music. It also maximises your feeling of despair by one hundred. ",
