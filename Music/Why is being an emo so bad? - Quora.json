            "answer_text": "The media has stereotyped emo\u2019s as cutters and suicidal fags that whine. Emo\u2019s also tend to wear all black and this creeps others out. Posers also ruined being emo as they post pics with their shitty hair style and whine way too much. Being emo is also quite scary to parents as they think their kid/s are in some sort of cult. The music emos listen to are usually very niche and not for a huge crowd as people call the music shit or whiny. People have also mixed emos with hardcore Twilight fans which makes people think that emos are cringy romantics that are waiting for some vampire which glitters. However, the truth is being emo isn't bad. It's a way of self expression and a big part of growing up. You don't need to have shitty hair or cut yourself to be emo. Being emo is just a way to cope with dark thoughts or pressure and hardship. The fact that people think being emo is like you\u2019re in a cult just shows small mindedness and not all emos whine or have to wear black. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not bad, people just see it as bad because it is different from them. Honestly I would rather be emo than look the same as all of those other people. It is a way of self expression and it is all together a style. It is NOT a cult . If someone is emo it does NOT mean that they cut or self harm or are suicidal. Yes, some emos are suicidal and self harm, but some preppy or country people also do these things. For most people, that kind of thing is related to mental illnesses and is not something to be joked about but some people do it for attention. So next time you see an emo person, don\u2019t think that they are bad, just treat them like a human, because that\u2019s what they are, human.. just like you. ",
