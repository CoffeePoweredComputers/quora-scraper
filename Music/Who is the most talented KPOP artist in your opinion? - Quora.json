            "answer_text": "Of those I am familiar with, there are a handful. I tend to put the most weight on: vocals, followed byskill in musical instruments,composition and production,dancing,variety/hosting/radio, andacting, followed byanything else they seem to be good at.Park Hyo Shin (1, 3, 2)Super Junior\u2019s Cho Kyuhyun (he goes by just Kyuhun for solo career) (1, 4, 5)EXO\u2019s Park Chanyeol (2, 3, 1 for timbre and pitch, although his vocal technique is better for rap than other types, with very good competence in 4/5/6)EXO\u2019s Do Kyungsoo (D.O) (1, 6, all EXO members are more than reasonable with 4)A Pink\u2019s Jung EunJi (1 for timbre and reasonable consistency, 6)(I\u2019m sure there are more but I can\u2019t think of them at this moment, too many) Vocally I also like Super Junior K.R.Y, EXO\u2019s Byun Baekhyun and EXO\u2019s Chen (Kim Jongdae). If I don\u2019t necessarily go off pure vocal skill, I also like EXO\u2019s Lay (2, 4, 3, with 5/6 in Mandarin, but not Korean, entertainment, his vocals are competent and generally on pitch), and members of Big Bang. Especially GD and TOP, but also Taeyang, learned production early on, and their musical composition is unique and very well done. Honestly, the same could be said of members of many Kpop groups, male and female - members are given training and opportunities in a variety of artistic mediums and entertainment avenues, from dramas, web dramas as a baby step, variety show hosting, with guesting as a baby step, the same goes for radio, etc. Only the most popular and skilled who work hard can have that premium level of success. Because I put the biggest value on vocal technique, I\u2019m probably leaving out a lot of people with balanced talent, plus I\u2019m not familiar with a lot of Kpop groups. ",
