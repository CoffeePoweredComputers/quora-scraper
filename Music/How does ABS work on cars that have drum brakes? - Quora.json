            "answer_text": "ABS or Anti lock braking system can be employed in both disc and drum brakes. The difference between drum and disc are the mechanism of actuation and the the components used. Brakes utilize frictional energy to induce a braking torque which acts in opposite direction to the driving torque which helps in vehicle deceleration. Now the working principle of ABS is to apply intermittent braking force so that the wheel doesn\u2019t lock up. Now when front wheels are locks the vehicle loses directional control and when the real wheel locks the vehicle loses its directional stability. The function of ABS is to prevent wheel lock.  Observe the above plot between coefficient of friction and percentage of wheel slip. When the maximum braking force is applied it occurs during 10\u201320% of wheel slip, so when value of braking force is greater than maximum value i.e F > \u03bcW (where \u03bc is the coefficient of friction and W is the applied axial force) the wheel locks. In case of normal braking when the force exceeds maximum value the wheel locks as a result the the percentage of wheel slip increases as a result the value of coefficient of friction drops and the tire loses grip. When ABS is used the wheel speed sensor detects wheel rpm and releases the wheel during lockup and when the wheel gains speed the brakes are again applied and this process happens multiple times and the vehicle comes to rest without any skidding or slip. The trick of ABS is that it maintains the value coefficient of friction between 10\u201320% wheel slip where the coefficient is the highest so as to get an efficient braking ABS also has shorter braking distances when compared to conventional brakes. Now coming to disc and drum brakes the working is as follows In disc brake the friction disc is connected to the wheel and the caliper is fixed to the vehicle and it is non-rotating , when the brakes are applied the calipers press against the disc with hydraulic action and friction is produced. In drum brakes the wheel has a drum and the friction shoes are placed inside the drum and are actuated by toggle lever mechanism, when the brakes shoes press against the drum and friction is produced. When drum brake with ABS is used the brake shoes are actuated and friction is produced as a result the wheel speed drops and the wheel speed sensor continuously monitors the wheel RPM. If it drops below critical value the shoes are retracted so that the wheel is free from locking and when the speed increases the shoes are actuated and this process happens multiple times. ",

            "answer_text": "Drum brakes work in a manner identical to disk brakes! There is a hydraulic connection that actuates the brake shoe to come in contact with the drum. Then a spring returns the shoe to its original position This is basically the same as brake discs, where a piston in the brake caliper is activated hydraulically to push the pad against the disk to stop the vehicle ABS uses an ECU to control this hydraulic actuation, to engage and release the disk or drum as the case may be So, in short, ABS works the same way on disk and drum brakes. The actuation is the same, the physical shape is different ",
