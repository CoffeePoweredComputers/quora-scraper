            "answer_text": "Yes.Anyone can play her old songs. You, me, the girl down the street. I can go on tour performing her old songs; and I can even record her old songs and release them and sell them\u2014as long as I pay the mechanical statutory rate as defined by United States law, which is currently at 9.1 cents per song sold/streamed. I can go to the Harry Fox agency and get my license and pay my fee to record them and sell them. And when I perform MY version of the songs live, or MY recording of the songs are played on the Radio, the her and co-songwriters get paid from their performing rights organization (ASCAP/BMI) Swift, her co-writers and publisher own the songs. Big Machine Records owns the sound recordings of the songs that they paid to have recorded by Swift. Two different copyrights, two different owners. Big Machine was bought by a guy Swift doesn\u2019t like. The contract she has for those songs is still valid, and in effect for those songs through Big Machine. She still gets paid by Big Machine for those songs when they get sold or streamed (if her contract didn\u2019t have a sunset clause). So yes, she can play her old songs provided she remembers how to play them. ",
