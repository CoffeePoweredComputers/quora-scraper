            "answer_text": "There have been many hot films made in bollywood in recent times. Earlier a single erotic scene in a movie would create much hype. I remember a kiss in \u201cRaja Hindustani\u201d was a buzz. Now a days it is a part and parcel of most films. I do not understand what you mean by hottest. But you can say Bhatt family tried to integrate it into movies many a time. So I must credit them as a trend setter with movies such as: MurderJism seriesHate story 2And many more. In recent times many film makers tried to make dirty films similar to \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d such as Masti seriesGood boy Bad BoyKya Kool Hai Hum series and few others.But back in 80\u2019s two films were released which made sensations Arth (1982) again Mahesh Bhatt directorialUtsav (1984)Both are a good watch. But if you ask me bollywood still has a long way to go for movies like \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d the real meaningful sensation. Ek Chotisi Love Story (2002) was a good try back then, but the theme is quite slow to make an impression. But for me hot movies too should carry love and emotion along with good chemistry and story line rather than keeping it slutty. Thanks for A2A ",

Sarika lures him to sleep with her in return for money. The last thing you would want to do is watch the story of a gigolo with your mom and dad. P.S. The film is dark and has tons of hot and sexy scenes. SinsIf you are a Bollywood movie buff, you might have definitely heard of this film. After all, this Shiney Ahuja and Seema Rahmani starrer was in controversy for its content. The story of the film goes where a priest starts an affair with a young girl. This film has sex...sex...and more sex written all over it. KamasutraThe title of the film is enough to educate you and tell you what to expect from it. There are few films made on the famous Sanskriti text of Vaatsayana that guides you about human sexuality.  And every film has its own way of narration, though the most acclaimed one is made by director Mira Nair. JulieStarring Neha Dhupia in the titular role, this film outlines the journey of a girl who ends up becoming a call girl. You can't watch this film with any elder around as Julie gets filthy and raunchy in various scenes. Jism SeriesWell....well what is it about 'Jism' that created a buzz in B-town when it was released? The first installment had some really hot scenes between Bipasha Basu and John Abraham. ",

            "answer_text": "Raj Kapoor was the hottest filmmaker in his time. And therefore from that era it has to be Satyam Shivam Sundaram and Raam Teri Ganga Maili Ho Gayi. Another movie that comes to mind is Utsav, because Rekha is the hottest female actor of India. In the modern times, Bipasha Basu had been the top hot heroine for some time and her movies had hotness quotient. I haven't seen all her movies and forget the name of some of her movies that may have been hot. Apart from these, I think the hottest movie of all time has to be 2004 release Murder. It established Imran Hashmi and gave him the title of serial kisser. And over night Mallika Sherawat was launched into the hearts of youngsters in India. It still remains the hottest movie because the magic that it worked with its song \u2014 with wordings like \u201cmere saath ek raat guzar, subah tak main karoonga pyar\u201d, still reverberates. Truly the hottest movie of Hollywood has to be- one and only MURDER. ",

This Mira Nair movie, which depicted the lives of four lovers in the 16th century in India, was a hit with the critics but a major flop with the Censor Board and ultimately got banned. We did see it coming.  Urf Professor (2000) Another movie to run into trouble with the Censor Board was Pankaj Advani'sUrf Professor starring Manoj Pahwa, Antara Mali, and Sharman Joshi. The movie traces the journey of the protagonist after a hit-man's car and a winning lottery ticket goes missing and the chaos that follows. However, what irked the Censor Board were the 'vulgar scenes' and 'bold language' used in this black comedy, which ultimately led to a ban on the movie.  Image credit Google ",
