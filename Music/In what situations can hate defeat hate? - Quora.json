            "answer_text": "Charlies, Zipperheads, Gooks, Dinks, Slopes. These were the names assigned to the North Vietnamese by American soldiers during the Vietnam war. They don't sound like nice names do they? Well, that's because they weren't. They are racially charged names, designed to dehumanize the enemy, single them out as \"other\", as inferior beings. It's pure, unmitigated Racism, trained hatred, designed to weaponize 18-year-old boys, to march off into a jungle and shoot people they know nothing about. If you can train them to think they are shooting gooks and dinks rather than people, pulling the trigger becomes easier. This isn't a knock on American military so much as it is the continuation of an ancient tradition of using racism in warfare. Across millennia, instillation of racism has worked terrifyingly well in helping soldiers manifest the very worst side of their humanity. I don't approve of the killing or the racism. I'm more of a make love not war kind of guy. Love wins over hatred. But not in warfare. ",

            "answer_text": "Hate has the potential to prevail over hate in pretty much all scenarios. Incidents where love actually stopped hatred are remembered only because they're so rare. It could be argued that many altercations to the extent of, but not limited to warfare have been fuelled by hatred, and in a strictly technical sense, in most cases one side does reign supreme. However, while external victory can be achieved through the medium of hatred, the only time you actually 'win' from within is when you don't let your hatred be the defining aspect or driving force of your existence, doing such a thing reduces you to a lesser form of who you were and leaves you with a hole that the hate has burned through within. Love might be a fragile force, and it may not win as many victories as hatred does, but if it empowers you to not even bother with the fight, you have won. ",
