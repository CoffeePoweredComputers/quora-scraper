            "answer_text": "YHT-196 is an older model and lacks Room correction controls and 4K pass throughs . it does not decode HD codecs like DTS master HD / Dolby Tru HD and also lacks USB port. The 2910 has 4 hdmi inputs and you can connect 4 devices at a time. I'm sure there won't be much difference in the price of both. If you watch Blurays and use USB drives to listen to music or own a 4k TV or have plans to buy one in near future, settle with 2910. Room correction feature can slightly improve performance and make it easy to set it up. But, note that the speaker packages are same with both and amp section are same. If you are too tight on budget and don't watch Bluray at all and don't mind about DTS mstr HD or Dolby Tru HD, 196 is just suffice. As 2910 is the latest model and probably should not cost that more, it should be your priority. Good luck. ",
