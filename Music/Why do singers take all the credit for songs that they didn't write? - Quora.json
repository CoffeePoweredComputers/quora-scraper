            "answer_text": "Songwriters don't get enough recognition because people care more about the person delivering the message rather than the creator of the message.  That's the point of the old saying, \"Don't kill the messenger.\" Take the Rodgers and Hart classic, My Funny Valentine.   That it was written by then increased the song's likelihood of success, but think about that song done by a singer at a local lounge vs Frank Sinatra.  The local singer may do a fantastic job singing that song, but it won't make much money for anyone else besides the payment he/she gets that night.  When Frank Sinatra did it, on the other hand, it was bound to be a hit.  Same song, two different performers, two different results. Dolly Parton had a nice country hit with I Will Always Love You.  It even hit twice on the country charts due to being re-recorded.  Whitney Houston took the same song and made it one of the biggest songs ever.  The performer matters.   The performer is the product being sold - not the song.  As is the case in almost every business ever, the product gets top billing. ",
