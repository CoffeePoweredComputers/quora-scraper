            "answer_text": "In general no. If you have two equal speakers, and power up one of them with 20 Watts, you measure, let\u2019s say 100dB. Now, power up both speakers with 10 Watts each. A total of 20 Watts, but now you have twice the membrane area, so the loudness increase by 3 dB to 103 dB at the same energy input. However, this is not perfectly true, but close. You see, when the membrane starts to move back and forth, its exursion have a mechanical limit as well as the force in the speaker motor is reduced as the exursion increase. This limit is felt from the first movement, and gradually limits more and more as the exursion increase. The 10 Watts applied to those pair of speakers will work lighter with less exursion and better electromagnetic coupling between the voicecoil and the magnetic polepiece. This will increase the sensitivity pr. Watt slightly compared to the single 20 Watt speaker. So you might measure more than 103 dB from the two speakers. Each speaker delivers now a little more than 97 dB each. ",

            "answer_text": "It is interesting case. Actualy I use this case for workshop of acoustics. We should first assume that three loudspeakers are identical. All loudspeaker has same loudness at 10W. Let's say that we get 70dBspl from one loudspeaker driven by 10W 1kHz sine signal. Now, how loud it is if we increase input to 20W? Yes +3dB. 73dB. Now, interesting case is two loud speakers at 10W. You receive identical waveform from two speakers and amplitude will be doucled. As a result you get +6dB which is 4 times higher energy dencity. Oops, you doubt? Please place microphone or SPL meter in front of two loudspeakers, you actuary get 4 times powerful signal from txo loudspeakers, Why? Of course avarage power of two loudspeakers is only douled. But at center front, it 4 times powerful. But if you are not front center and difference of distance to the two units is half of the wavelength, sound those sound may cancelweach other. So, answer is, two loudspeaker with 10W is twice louder at low frequency, louder or weaker depending on the frequency and location in general. ",
