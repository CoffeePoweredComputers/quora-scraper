            "answer_text": "It Depends \u00a9. Both are iconic guitar designs, built for over half a century (not totally unchanged, but extremely recognizable over their production lives), that defined the sound of some of the most famous musicians in recent history. So, assuming a quality example of either design, which is \u201cbetter\u201d is really up to your personal tastes in music and sound. When people talk about the differences, the Fender\u2019s single-coil pickups versus the Les Paul\u2019s humbuckers are usually the first item of discussion. Fender Strats are often described with terms like \u201cbright\u201d, \u201cgritty\u201d, \u201cclear\u201d, \u201cedgy\u201d, but also \u201cnoisy\u201d, \u201charsh\u201d, \u201cthin\u201d, \u201cquiet\u201d, etc. This is because they\u2019re typically built with single-coil pickups wound with about 5000 to 8000 turns of wire. This is in comparison to pickups traditionally used on Les Pauls, the P-90 single coil and the \u201cfull-size\u201d Gibson humbucker, both traditionally wound with about 10,000 turns of wire. All other things being equal, more turns of wire around the bobbin gets you a \u201chotter\u201d signal as there\u2019s more wire around the magnet to induce current, at the cost of a darker sound due to \u201cinductive reactance\u201d, which increases the impedance of the entire circuit at higher frequencies of A/C current. In addition, since about 1955, the humbucking pickup has been the most popular pickup style for Les Pauls. This pickup design uses two coils oriented in such a way that the signal produced by the vibrating guitar string is \u201cin phase\u201d between the two coils, but noise produced by electromagnetic inductors or radiators (anything from radios and TV stations to nearby electrical transformers and power lines) is \u201cout of phase\u201d and cancels out. A side effect of the design is that the vibrations of the string are sensed in different places along its length by each coil of the pickup, which for very short wavelengths like higher harmonics can also end up out of phase and cancelled out, so again the humbucker will tend to have less high end than a Strat single coil. But, the humbucker also will reject noise better, and this along with the higher signal output are preferable for higher gain levels, especially modern rock and metal. Strat single coils simply don\u2019t drive the amp as hard without additional help both to boost the raw guitar signal and attenuate the noise picked up by the coils. However, in lower-gain situations, the clear, singing quality of the Strat singles is often preferred to the darker, sometimes muddy tone that a Les Paul can have at lower gain settings. The three-pickup design, and the ability to select pairs of pickups for desirable \u201cquacky\u201d or \u201ctwangy\u201d interactions between their two signals, makes the Strat a mainstay of older genres like classic rock, blues, rockabilly, Southern rock and country. In some of these genres like country, the even twangier Telecaster has become the go-to, but Strats are well-represented in modern country as well. You can also push a Strat into full distortion, with the aforementioned help boosting gain and controlling noise in the form of pedal effects, and/or by replacing the single-coil pickups with hum-cancelling designs. Purists will say you never quite get back to the clear tone of a real single-coil Strat, and IMO they\u2019re right, but you can get close, and if you don\u2019t even want to get close (and just want the Strat shape for its looks or ergonomics), a whole new world opens up.

            "answer_text": "It is impossible to duplicate the Les Paul sound with a Stratocaster. It is impossible to duplicate the Stratocaster sound with a Les Paul. If you are like me, you want access to both. Other players tend to hook up with one style, one sound. I don\u2019t get that. My SG does not sound like a Les Paul or a Strat. It has great power and good sustain with more high-end and less lows than my Les Paul. It\u2019s tone remains distinct from the Strat, which has a bite all its own and very different harmonic qualities. The Strat is a tinkerer\u2019s platform. A Strat won\u2019t overdrive a tube amp unless you crank it to 11. Lots of players tend to combine a Strat with a super-clean amp, then use pedals to provide tonal flexibility, overdrive, fuzz, modulation and whatever else (including noise reduction necessary for the Strat\u2019s single-coil pickups). The Les Paul \u2026 it is a shame to waste its natural qualities. Les Paul + dirty tube amp = that \u201csinging-woman\u201d tone. Output tends to be hot enough to drive the amp at moderate volume. Put some modulation in the effects loop, but don\u2019t mess up the Les Paul magic. One more element to consider: Weight. The Les Paul is a heavy guitar. They can run 9\u201312 pounds depending on the model. The Stratocaster runs around 8\u20138.5 pounds. Weight might really matter to you. To me, the heavier the better. Then again, I also have my SG and PRS that are in the Strat weight category, to go with my S-style Dean Zelinsky. Never shut myself off from any style. Besides, I\u2019ll have a Telecaster before you know it. ",
