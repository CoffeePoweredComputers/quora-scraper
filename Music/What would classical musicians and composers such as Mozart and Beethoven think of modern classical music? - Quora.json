            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a direct answer to this question and then there\u2019s a dodge, but I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I start with the dodge before getting to the direct answer. Mozart died in 1791. Beethoven died in 1827. In the 190 years since then, the world has seen all sorts of different classical music, and much of it would probably be hated by both Mozart and Beethoven, despite the fact that, in a sense, they created it. Have you ever been around people who have known each other since they were small children? When people like that get together they have a pretty particular quirk: they tend to have inside jokes such that they find stuff funny that no other person on the planet would find funny. A word or a picture that would seem totally random to 99.9% of the population will remind them of something that happened decades ago, and they\u2019ll just crack up. One of them can say \u201cpeanut butter\u201d and it\u2019s genuinely hilarious to the group\u2014funnier, in fact, than if one of them told an actual joke (a funny one!) that they all happen to have heard before. If someone today writes a piece in the style of Beethoven, it comes across as though one of those friends told an actual, normal joke. Everyone acknowledges that it\u2019s good, but there\u2019s also an element of \u201c\u2026we know this joke already. Have you not been paying attention? We\u2019ve moved on from it.\u201d But if one of the friends riffs on the joke, taking it a step further, or turning it on its head, that\u2019s much funnier to the group, even if it wouldn\u2019t be funny to an outsider. In a way, this sort of thing happens with art over the course of centuries, and the people who are in on the joke are the people who have been paying attention to that art form. People who like old masters paintings but haven\u2019t internalized the chronology of the art world complain about this all the time, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you understand why a traditional portrait would be beyond anachronistic today. Likewise, if you\u2019ve been paying attention to classical music for the past 190 years, it\u2019ll be weird as hell for someone to write a piece that would make seamless sense to Beethoven. The point of writing new music is that it allows for a kind of inside joke iterated across centuries among \u201cfriends\u201d who never met and who might not even like each other. And if one of your friends drops out of your circle for decades and then tries to reenter, he/she might not get a bunch of references, but on some level you\u2019ll have some common language. It\u2019s not Beethoven\u2019s fault that he\u2019s been unable to see the changes in classical music over the centuries since his death (\u2026he\u2019s been dead\u2026), but he\u2019d definitely struggle to understand them at first. Music today would likely seem intermittently crass, boring, and nonsensical to him, and Mozart would likely be appalled at the lack of creativity within structure (in which, ironically, both creativity and structure would seem to him to have fallen by the wayside). They\u2019d think today\u2019s music was deeply, deeply flawed. That\u2019s the direct answer here, but I hope you can see why that answer misses the point in so many ways. New music of any generation is a riff on old music. In order to understand what makes new music great, you need to have been watching the inside joke morph over the centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "Nice question. To answer it, I have to make my bias and answer instead of either Beethoven or Mozart based on my understanding of their music and what they loved to do and how and where they were raised and educated. Now since you asked about the opinion of Mozart or Beethoven I might assume you did so on purpose? Because both of those two composers were quite open minded. Their music seems more structured and complex when compared to modern music. Right? Not so fast. Both have composed a huge variety of symphonies, orchestras (orchestral music that is not symphonic), chamber music (also including symphonies), dances, songs, some sacred pieces of music, operas etc. And I think Mozart is the one who even has a wider range of music then Beethoven did have. Also know that Mozart was known to ignore the set rules and play by his own book. In that sense I think Philip Glass would be interesting to both. Philip Glass has minimalist music and also full fledged symphonies. And his operas/musicals are interesting extension to classical opera. But any other artists you mentioned is too abstract to be understood by someone coming from places and times as Mozart and Beethoven were from. No way they would enjoy this \u201ccacophony\u201d. I\u2019m from our modern times and even I do not understand that. Cage, Stockhausen and others created this weird sound chains, to break our habits and leave repetition behind. They called it proper and modern musical education. Yet they dismissed the importance of repetition in music. They called it serious music. Music that was not meant to entertain. Don\u2019t make me laugh. That\u2019s why neither Cage or Stockhausen are important anymore. If it wasn\u2019t for the mention here and there, who would consider them? Since Mozart was a little of a punk nature, he might love some modern artists like the Prodigy or Scooter or some Kraut Rock, Kraftwerk and Jean-Michel Jarre. But definitely not Stockhausen or Cage. I for myself tried Arvo P\u00e4rt. And I like some Kraut Rock, with all the variety in between electronic sounds, rock and jazz. Yet Arvo P\u00e4rt is too weird for me. Kinda creepy. Like Messiaen or Takemitsu. Strange and unsettling music. Now Beethoven and Mozart were also known for some requiems they wrote. Also not quite \u201cfun\u201d music or the occasion the music was meant for at least is not fun. The music however was meant to uplift you, not to push you down. To shine some light in a dark moment. Arvo P\u00e4rt, Cage and others are totally abusing the darkness, the creepiness, the haunting sounds they create. And that is a modern idea nobody in the Classical era would have supported. Now I almost forgot about Steve Reich. I think in terms of structure - music for 18 musicians, Beethoven might be interested in his works. Or in terms of counterpoint Mozart might love his \u201ccounterpoint for electric guitar\u201d or the train variations. Other than that I guess given the time to get used to our times, both could accept some of our modern music as well. Just leave them alone with atonal or too experimental stuff. ",
