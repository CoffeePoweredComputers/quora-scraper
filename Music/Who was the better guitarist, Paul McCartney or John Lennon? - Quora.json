            "answer_text": "First of all its very hard to prove WHO was the best because they all had unique skills the others didn\u2019t have ESPECIALLY when it came to guitar playing. First of all, all 3 of them could rip on guitar. Also being that all 3 were incredible composers who had incredible ideas brought each 3 of their unique talents when it came to playing guitar. All 3 had incredible chord progression ideas that proof is in their songwriting & they all composed on guitar or piano. All 3 could rip solos very well!! Obviously we all knew George could do it as evidenced on a lot of the Beatles studio albums including later on his slide playing. You can see John absolutely rip a solo on the Apple roof gig during Get Back track & his guitar solo on I Want You (she\u2019s so heavy) is awesome!. I finally saw how great a lead player Paul was if you check him out on his Wings concerts, even today Paul is ripping great consistent soulful leads in his tours today! Absolutely! Also I do not agree with Ted Mason comment that you could see Paul\u2019s limitations as a songwriter when they all went solo, what??? Yes John & George had great hits but so did Paul absolutely! He had so MANY great tracks for the Wings projects (which Paul wrote everything) & him on his own. Paul was the one who motivated John to get off his ass, cause when John saw how much success Paul was having with Wings, he thought damn I better do something & get back out there. I don\u2019t understand how Ted Mason can ignore Paul\u2019s solo work? Probably had more hit tracks & more success then any of them! Absolutely! Paul was probably the best overall muscian out of the 3 but like I said all 3 were monsters so it\u2019s like asking who\u2019s the best-peanut butter, Jam or sliced bread.EditReply Sponsored by M1 FinanceWhy are investors flocking to the M1 Finance app?Free, automated, fractional shares, military-grade security, tax savings, dynamic rebalancing, and more.Get the AppRELATED QUESTIONS (MORE ANSWERS BELOW) ",

            "answer_text": "Paul made the classic song Maybe I\u2019m Amazed all by himself with some background vocals from his wife, playing ALL the instruments. (Had it been a Beatles single, it would likely have been a smash single topping the charts.) Paul and George grew up as teens learning the guitar TOGETHER. George might have been a little bit better but both were fairly equal in talent on the guitar. Taxman\u2019s lead guitar was assumed to be George until the world found out later it as Paul! Same with Paul on 5 Beatles songs playing drums. And Paul wrote the mellotron-like opening for John\u2019s song Strawberry fields Forever. His bass guitar playing is considered to be in the top 3 of all time. I think George is in the top 10 guitarists, but not as high as #3. Paul did lead guitar on a handful of Beatles tunes and many of his solo hits. As a lead guitarist (or anything with a guitar), he is right at the top along with George perhaps a bit better. Practice makes perfect and Lead Guitar was Georges JOB! As bass guitarist Paul was the best in the Beatles without a doubt though John and George could play the instrument. John was probably best at rhythm guitar. He said himself he wasn\u2019t the best but implied he was inventive with it. Most guitar experts seem to agree. Of course it was the songwriting that made the Beatles the best band! And John and Paul were the best ever at that! George rose to the top by the later albums as well. Along with the irreplaceable perfection pf Ringo on drums, they were all the best at what they did in the time they were in the band, and have gone down in history as the band to beat for the past 55+ years! (And no one has beaten the Beatles yet on any level of music, popularity, influence, or sales!) ",
