            "answer_text": "This is such a direct question that is low key offensive. I only say that because it really does give this perception that EXO-L\u2019s are being bitter/immature fans. I personally think that EXO-L\u2019s acknowledge BTS success worldwide but its just a matter of immature fans that keep comparing and downgrading each other that you have this negative view upon EXO-L\u2019s. Like every other comment has mentioned. Every fandom have their immature fans. Its inevitable to not encounter immature fans because what they say are very offensive and you will always find the need to defend your idols. BTS success is very well known among all fandoms, they\u2019re lying if they don\u2019t know but its a matter of acknowledging it and giving a sort of boost of confidence for the immature fans, thats the problem. Like I said immature fans are the problem and they are always getting the attention that they are seeking that gives them more confidence to hate and drag others. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, my guess is, they want their fandom to rise to the top, as Bts is. As Bts is being more known, EXO is still kinda in the shadows to other foreigners that are just getting interested into Kpop, and since bts happens to be more world wide\u2026Bts is probably gonna be one of the first ones they check out. And im not saying Exo isn\u2019t good, im saying just the opposite in fact. I guess they see it like a contest or a competition, between the two fandoms. Even though their really is no conflict between Bts and Exo, the fans (as usual) take it into a more serious matter, and make it seem like a bigger problem than it already is. And Just a pointer, Bts and Exo get along pretty swell, so i dont really see the big problem. All i know is that the fans are taking it way to seriously, and it does not surprise me that they would be angry or disappointed at the matter. So like i said i really like Exo and Bts both the same so im not really worried about the whole conflict thing. ",
