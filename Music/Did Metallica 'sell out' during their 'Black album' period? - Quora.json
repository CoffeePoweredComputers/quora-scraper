            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Maybe it's been a while since you have listened to it? Metallica has NEVER \u201csold out\" in the sense that you mean, compromising musical integrity to gain album sales. They had sold out concerts all the time, so they had no worries. The fans will always come, even if just to hear the classics. Let's think about that album. Even if you say that Enter Sandman isn't up to par from previous Metallica standards, because it isn't like Ride the Lightning or The Four Horsemen, I will let you get away with that one. But Sad But True is pretty cool, and so is Unforgiven. But what I really need you to do is listen to Of Wolf and Man again. They have not had anything so badass since Master of Puppets. It is amazing. My definition of an amazing song is one that makes you feel raw emotion. Some of the best examples are: What A Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong Purple Rain by Prince Hey Jude by the Beatles At Last by Ella Fitzgerald Ripple by The Grateful Dead Master of Puppets I Will Always Love You as sang by Whitney Houston (written by Dolly Parton) Do you see what I mean? Of Wolf and Man fits here. Now, let's move on to Load. I honestly didn't really dig it. But still, they did NOT sell out, they grew up. Think about it\u2026when you're 50 years old, you might want to marry your girlfriend and start a family while you still can. Hetfield cleaned up because he grew up. Cutting your hair is not selling out. It is just being who you are at this point in your life. You change a lot as a person from age 20 to age 50. (And if you don't, there is something seriously wrong with you.) So, as you can see, Metallica never sold out. They grew up, and continued to stay true to whom they were at that point in their lives. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. It's really that simple. I don't like the music that they have made since Load, so I don't listen to it. Just listen to Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets and you will be fine. I also liked the song Blackened, and the Justice tour was really super cool. I went a lot of nights in the good seats! Enjoy Metallica, they are truly amazing! ",

            "answer_text": "No, and they didn\u2019t need to \u201csell-out.\u201d They had chosen to play some of the most uncommercial metal of that time and they were selling more albums with each one they released. And Justice For All was a multi-platinum selling album and they headlined arenas on that tour. When you\u2019re headlining arenas and every album you\u2019ve released has done better than the last, what is the incentive to sell-out? Once you\u2019re doing that well, an abrupt change in style isn\u2019t selling out; it\u2019s a major risk. There were plenty of metal bands before Metallica to go in a less heavy direction and it usually failed. They\u2019d then go back to their original style. Remember Judas Priest\u2019s Turbo album? Black could have very likely turned out as badly for them as Turbo did for Judas Priest and it also could have done much worse than Turbo. There was no reason to think that taking the risk they took with the Black album would have paid off as well as it did for them. They didn\u2019t know if they could write songs in a more mainstream style and have it work well for them. James Hetfield doesn\u2019t have one of the best voices in heavy metal; he was good at singing the style they already had. He\u2019s not an elite level singer like a Rob Halford or a Geoff Tate or a Ronnie James Dio. Metallica decided to take a risk because they wanted to do something different and it worked out very well for them. It could just as easily have been a failure. The safe thing to do would have been to repeat the style they already knew they could do successfully and instead they tried something different. That isn\u2019t selling-out. That\u2019s doing what you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "For many who\u2019d previously been fans of Metallica during their first few albums, the Black album will always be remembered as the beginning of the end. Compared to their earlier raw, thrashy sound, the Black album is watered down and overproduced. There are good songs on there, but they aren\u2019t representative of what the fans loved them for. From memory (I had less and less to do with the band after this point) each album after gets further and further from their original, thrash metal roots (something that never really got properly addressed until maybe the St Anger album - too little, too late). They got greedy, gig ticket prices skyrocketed and the Napster debacle was just a perfect example of how far they\u2019d fallen from the metal/anti-corporate ethos that is ingrained in most metal fans. All bands evolve to some extent, at least the good ones do. Metallica, however, completely abandoned everything that made the band good, and showed little to no regard for their loyal fanbase who\u2019d made them so successful in the first place while doing so. All just to line their pockets. 80s metal fans remember that kind of thing - hence the \u201csellout\u201d label. ",

            "answer_text": "I have two comments on this one: The Black Album is not a sell-out. It is the first time Metallica let bass lines be heard on an album, giving the whole thing a much more balanced sound. If you adjust your EQ to eliminate the bass when you listen to it, many of the songs still adhere to their thrash roots, which are mixed as such on every album up until this one.Metallica \u201csold out\u201d when they dumped Mustaine and replaced him with Hammett. They traded the punk fire of Mustaine and the very core of thrash music, which would be hard to maintain in a tour bus without killing each other for a much easier to swallow guitar player for hire in Hammett for the sake of band longevity.",

That in itself isn\u2019t definitive proof that Metallica sold out. Many hard rock and metal musicians want to make softer music as they get old. The real evidence of them selling out would be their actions with Napster. One of the richest bands in the world, and they sue a relatively obscure filesharing service into bankruptcy. That was a move you\u2019d expect from a big corporation, not a metal band. ",
