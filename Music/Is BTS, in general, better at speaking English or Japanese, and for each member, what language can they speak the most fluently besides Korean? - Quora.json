            "answer_text": "overall, bts is most fluent in english. i think they\u2019ve had the most exposure when it comes to speaking english because they do a lot of english interviews and study it often. i don\u2019t know any japanese, though, and there is a lot less videos or interviews of them speaking japanese, so i cannot tell if they stutter or have a bad accent. they probably don\u2019t have a bad accent though because they\u2019ve been making japanese songs since 2014. rm is the most fluent in english, with supple evidence as he talks the most and translates in english interviews. he also has basically no accent, but he seems to stutter or trip over his words due to nerves. rm is also said to be fluent in japanese, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as his english. i think he\u2019s the second best in bts when it comes to japanese. jin\u2019s english is broken, but actually pretty good for how busy bts is. he knows quite a few phrases and his accent isn\u2019t too bad. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever heard him speak japanese other than when singing, though, so i\u2019m not a good judge for that. yoongi\u2019s english is really good! he has almost no accent, and he knows a lot of words. when he doesn\u2019t speak a lot of english, i think he\u2019s just too shy. his japanese is probably the 3rd best in bts because he has to do his fast raps in japanese sometimes. hobi\u2019s english is good, and he knows quite the vocabulary. i think other than yoongi, he\u2019s the next to be fluent. i don\u2019t know anything about his japanese though, but he\u2019s said quite a few times it isn\u2019t very good (he could just be being modest, or maybe his japanese is just really poor). jimin\u2019s english isn\u2019t that good really. i think he\u2019s just learnt a few phrases and words, because his english is very repetitive and he\u2019s just saying what he knows, not what he wants to say. his japanese likely isn\u2019t much better than his english. taehyung is the only member i think is more fluent in japanese than english. he used to get private japanese lessons with rm, but i think he continued it longer. he stutters a bit, but i think he just doesn\u2019t get to speak japanese often, so he has to think more to find the proper words. i don\u2019t think his english is that good though. he has a strong accent and slurs his words sometimes, and i haven\u2019t heard him speak very much in interviews. i think he\u2019s just shy like yoongi sometimes. jungkook sounds fluent in english when it comes to his accent, and i think he practices speaking a lot. the issue is, i think jk blanks when he has to actually speak english in a conversation, and he doesn\u2019t know a lot of words, probably the least out of everyone. i think his good pronounciation is due to his covers, but he doesn\u2019t really learn a lot of words from songs, just pronounciation. his japanese probably isn\u2019t much better. i just watched them do a japanese thing on stage, and he only made sound effects, not words. i think he\u2019s too shy like tae and yoongi.

            "answer_text": "RM is the member who is perfectly fluent in English and the other members try a lot too! Jungkook for example is so fluent when he performs cover, Taehyung has written and sung two solo songs in English! Jimin and Jungkook sand Who with Lauv, Hobi tries a lot too, he made chicken noodle soup with Becky G, and though he was really nervous but I am sure he made it work! Yoongi and Jin have also been mentioning how they study English. On the other hand I feel like they have got a basic level of Japanese proficiency because I myself am a Basic Japanese student and I can very well understand most of their conversations of their interviews(which I feel very proud of). Also, they keep on mentioning on many occasions that they are trying hard to improve their Japanese and carry their Japanese books on tours and other places. Recently it was revealed that Suga took English classes in an institute earlier (I guess in school or something not very sure about that) So he might be hiding the fact he knew fluent English all this time. And there was this time when RM said in an interview that 'he is sad cause the members never try to learn english(which is so true lol not that I'm complaining its cute when they speak broken english)[this was way back though, they have changed a lot for the better now] and all other members were clueless about what was going on except Suga who immidiately replied by saying something which was totally fluent(in English).
