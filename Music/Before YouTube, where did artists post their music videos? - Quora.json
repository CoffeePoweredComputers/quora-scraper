            "answer_text": "Once upon a time\u2026. When dinosaurs roamed the Earth (back around 1980) there was a thing called MUSIC TELEVISION or MTV and they played music videos NON STOP 24/7. And when people who paid $85 for cable found NOTHING on 200 channels including HBO and Showtime they would turn on MTV, eat fudge brownies and smoke funny cigarettes. MTV even had a program for local bands called BASEMENT TAPES and allowed open submissions of video tapes of your band playing original music. Then one day MTV discovered REALITY television and decided it was better than music videos for reaching more viewers. And they stopped playing Music Videos. But after a decade or two there came YouTube and the Music Video found a new home. And they lived happily ever after. ",

Or watched shows like Ed Sullivan, Sonny and Cher, Late Night TV shows, and other TV shows. And American Bandstand. And if we liked the song, we went to the record store and bought the record or album. ",

            "answer_text": "I imagine you\u2019re dating yourself\u2026for hundreds of years people LISTENED to music, not WATCH it (unless it was a live performance). The experience is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT because we humans tend to be very visual so having the video images distracts us from LISTENING to the music. There were tv shows back in the 60s (e.g., Ed Sullivan) where new artists were featured but most of us found new music by listening to the radio, purchasing records and going to concerts where new albums were being played and promoted. Then MTV came along and bands had the opportunity to do many different things to attract our eyes instead of our ears. Sadly, the more recent focus on internet video has promoted the single (and associated video) as the medium for new music, concerts are often where people go to see \u201cgreatest hits\u201d performed and the demise of the \u201calbum\u201d as a cohesive collection of songs by an artist is on its way out. I suggest you turn off the screen and LISTEN to your favorite music and determine if it\u2019s the music you love or the video. Looking forward\u2026Chris ",
