In fact James Hetfield is equal 18th of richest Rock stars, so not just Metal. And Lars Ulrich is the richest metal drummer in the world. And Kirk Hammett with 200 million isn't too shabby either. Robert Trujillo is \u201conly\" at 50 million, since he didn't start with the band, He joined a lot later. So overall Metallica is worth roughly 850 million dollars. ",
