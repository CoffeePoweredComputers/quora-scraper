            "answer_text": "I mean they had a ton of predebut songs, but their first official song and debut is\u2026. No More Dream!! On June 13, 2013.  I had a conversation with a girl another day during my gym period in school and she said she liked BTS and was a huge fan, along with listening to their songs a ton, so I tested her by asking what their debut song was. She responded, \u201cUmm, is it Blood, Sweat, and Tears?\u201d *mental facepalm* \u201cNo\u2026\u201d I answered. \u201cBST was released in 2016. A while after they debuted, and their boost to popularity.\u201d \u201cOh! Oh! I know!!\u201d She jumps up excitedly. \u201cYes?\u201d I responded eagerly. \u201cBoy In Luv?!\u201d Another mental facepalm. I then proceeded to explain to her it was No More Dream, and Boy In Luv was released in 2014, while NMD was released in 2013. I assumed she knew Boy In Luv because of Boy With Luv. Goes to show how their debut song needs more appreciation. Don\u2019t forget, if it weren\u2019t for this song, you wouldn\u2019t get the new songs like Boy with Luv or DNA or Idol or Fake Love. ",
