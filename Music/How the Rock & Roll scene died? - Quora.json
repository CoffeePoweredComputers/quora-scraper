            "answer_text": "Well here are all the reasons: It got saturated (too many bands)It got diluted with weaker and irrelevant bandsTechnology has allowed sub-par musicians to put together music and release it on youtube and internetWhat\u2019s happening today is that there is too much music and people don\u2019t have the time to sift through the crapThe average attention span of people has dropped and people generally don\u2019t care about music anymorePeople today care more about an iphone release than an album release. The next technology release is a bigger cultural event than music released from a big rock band. Take U2 for example. They had to spam people with their music whether the people liked it or not.Teen girls stopped liking rock and turned to hip hop or rap and the boys went with them! You know that\u2019s the truth!The record industry won\u2019t develop artists anymore because there is no money in making music.Without a record industry push, no band can really survive or make itRock and roll today has been reduced to a circus act that you can see any day of the week at your local dive bar (again dilution and saturation)Today the masses care more about singers than anything else. No one really cares about a band with a bassist, guitarist and a drummer. The very notion of that is old school. Girls want a beat to dance to. Right?Let\u2019s say you are a band starting out in your average sized city. Chances are there are hundreds of bands around. Here are the exact steps. You find some people you can get along with and get something going.I would say 85% of the bands die right here. It\u2019s sort of like what happens to most small businesses, they die within the first few months because they can\u2019t survive. In this case you just can\u2019t find committed people who will show up to practice, that you can get along with and be on board with your music. Most young people aren\u2019t dependable enough or have the dillegence to start a band and stick with it.If you make it through that hurdle and actually have a band together and again, you really have to have the stars align for this to happen, then you start writing, recording and playing out.Once you start playing out you find very quickly that the best you can hope for is to be stuck forever in the bar scene! That is, there are way, way, way too many bands playing every night and getting a gig is pretty tough. Now you gotta kiss the dive bar owner\u2019s ass to get a gig. For all he cares you could be a circus juggling act, he just wants something going so the people keep drinking. It\u2019s as simple as that, really nothing more. The dive bar or venue owners don\u2019t give a fuck about you band.You play out and then not enough people show up. If you bring 4 or 5 people to a show you may never play there again. Again, the bar owner wants to get a band that can draw and it is almost impossible for a band to draw 30\u201350 people consistently. Consistency is the key here.You drag your friends and family to your show after you begged them but they want to see you one time not 3 times a month. This is a key point.You play a few gigs where you can\u2019t draw and you find yourself in a rut, you run out of places to play cause no one wants you.Then there is the saturation phenomenon. The bars are filled with sub-par wanna be rock star bands. There are tons of bands with 45 years old guys and they won\u2019t leave the scene, clogging it up for everyone.Then you\u2019ll run into bands that have been together for 10\u201320 years who are still exactly where you are. You are playing with them.Once you start to play out, you will become very depressed because it is pretty much hopeless. Being in a band requires tons of time and lots of money. It is a very expensive hobby! Eventually people just give up but some will still persist and continue to make it impossible for real talented people and younger people to rise. Yes, those are the 45 year old guys still in a rock band clogging up your local venue that I\u2019m talking about. Now I\u2019m not talking about the cover bands that are older that\u2019s probably ok. As on older dude told me from experience, \u201cno one wants to see a bunch of old guys still trying to make it\u201d. For some reason musicians still don\u2019t seem to understand that for a band to take off several things have to happen. Rock has to be in it\u2019s upswing (it is not)People get excited about young talentBig labels don\u2019t sign artists older than 25 (this is a rumor but likely true)If you put out a single and you don\u2019t have 100 people downloading it for free, then that\u2019s probably a sign that your music isn\u2019t going to make an impact.The painful bottom line is: People don\u2019t even want your music if you give it away for free. That\u2019s right, who wants to download a song today? Now if it is a hot hip hop, EDM or rap track they will!The average rocker is around 35 or 45. Seriously. I do not know a single person under 23 that listens to rock or pays for music.Rock musicians don\u2019t understand the concept of fame. For someone to like your music and worship you and take you seriously you need more than talent. 99.999% won\u2019t get that kinda of adoration and that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to make it. There was time for this, it was called the 70s and 80s.After having said all this: Big rock acts from the 70s and 80s and 90s are still kicking ass because they become famous long time ago. When the likes of Metallica and other huge acts slowly retire, rock may slowly fade away. ",
