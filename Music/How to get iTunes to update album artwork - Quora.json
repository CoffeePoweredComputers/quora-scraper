            "answer_text": "If you are talking about the iTunes programme on your computer, I suggest you do your own updates. You can drag and drop album covers, EP and 45 covers, onto your iTunes from anywhere online. For interesting cover variations, foreign versions, etc. I recommend Discogs; for clean, mainstream artwork I recommend Amazon or Wikipedia. Also, Google images has interesting options. ",
