            "answer_text": "Writing from personal experience as one male who twice married a non musician female, musicians tend to be high maintenance, unpredictable and moody types, in general. Also, Musicians lifestyles are chaotic and unstable loaded with assorted emotional baggage, hangups, blind spots and financial issues which are elements NOT exclusive to musicians but are prominent and evident just based on the very basic nature of creative and artistic types and the music making business. While these issues are also common among non musician couples, they are paramount in the musician and, oddly enough, the musician will usually only realize the \"problems\" in the OTHER (musician) partner and NOT himself. So why go through the dance, IMHO, to amplify your own troubled personality with another musician? Just saying. ",
