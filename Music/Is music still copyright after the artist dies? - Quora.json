Anything published after 1978 is copyrighted for the life of the author/composer/etc/ plus seventy years. If published between 1923 and 1978, it is for the life of the creator plus 95 years or 120 years from the date of publication, whichever comes first.

            "answer_text": "Yes. In most countries, the artist\u2019s copyright expires 50 or 75 years after the artist\u2019s death (depending on the country). In the US, the copyright situation is more complicated. There are various exceptions, but it\u2019s safe to assume that everything published in the US since 1923 is still under copyright there. If the artist is no longer alive, copyright goes to his or her estate and heirs. ",
