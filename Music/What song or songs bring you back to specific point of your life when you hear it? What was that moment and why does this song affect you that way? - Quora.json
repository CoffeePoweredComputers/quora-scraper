            "answer_text": "I think the worst moment was when I was actually chased off a train. I declared myself an atheist, and the students declared open season on me. They would follow me around, hissing at me. They would bully me, they would tease me about my weight and my bad hair, they would tell me I\u2019d burn in Gehennom. They held books over my head, making me jump. And finally, they all surrounded me on the Q train and shouted at me, slamming their hands around me. I ran off, shaking. I was crying, I\u2019m short, I\u2019m not good at standing up for myself. Waited for the next train. I got home, and locked myself in a shower and put the water on and sobbed. I saw them the next day, praying a fervent Shachrit (morning) prayer. No shame, no guilt. I told the head rabbi what happened. He told me I brought it on myself. \u201cMaybe if you believed in God, people wouldn\u2019t dislike you.\u201d Evil in the name of a god is so much more noxious. Because then it\u2019s \u201cjustified.\u201d[1] When I think of that Head Rabbi, I think of \u201cGod Thinks\u201d by Voltaire.  I remember hearing that song and thinking \u201cPreach.\u201d If God existed, he loved me more than my bullies. God thinks all people like you are evilGod thinks all people like you are an embarrassment to creationSelf-righteous, judgmental, first to throw the stone and use His name for your own protection (Aurelio Voltaire \u2013 God Thinks) I met Voltaire a few years later, and I told him how his song was so helpful to me. I got a huge hug and a great picture. Footnotes[1] Elke Weiss's answer to What was your worst moment in high school as a bullying victim?",

There is a line in the song (which is basically a euphemism to describe the LSD experience) \u201cjigsaw puzzles on a tree and it brings it all back to me\u201d And it does bring back to me the feeling of the awakening that the experience was in its day An awakening that I feel grateful to have had Amongst others since, not LSD related But it was a very magical time to be alive and grow up in.
