First famous musician: Perhaps the castrato Farinelli (24 January 1705 \u2013 16 September 1782), if you mean a celebrity in terms of a reputation in multiple countries, bringing his audience to tears when he sang, commanding vast sums to perform, captivating women regardless he was a castrato, a superb public personae (always kind and even-tempered as opposed other castrati), and in great demand by royalty. Also a technique that astonished and never failed, whether he was singing solo or in opera, in a voice that cannot be recreated. ",

So to come up with an answer, I will define these things and in a way that I know cannot be challenged. The geographical area will be my home in which I am the premier musician for the last 20 years (Since my son moved out and got married. He\u2019s good), I am known by all in this defined area (my wife of many years), and she does not dispute that I am the better musician. And on top of that, I was the first musician in this household. So there you have it. Thank you, thank you very much\u2026.. Encore?\u2026. Well OK. ",
