            "answer_text": "Xuxi is Lucas\u2019s birth name. Lucas actually has four names: Lucas, which is his stage name.Kwang Wook-hee \u9ec3\u65ed\u7199, which is his Korean name.Wong Yuk-hei \ud669\uc6b1\ud76c, which is his first birth name.Huang Xuxi, which is his second birth name.So, the other NCT members call Lucas Xuxi because that\u2019s what his birth name is. It\u2019s the same case with Haechan, the members sometimes call him Donghyuck, which is his birth name. Another reason could be that it just feels more normal, to call Lucas by his birth name rather than his stage name. It\u2019s a bit weird to refer to someone by their stage name all of the time. Also, a stage name is meant to represent the person\u2019s persona on stage, and from what I\u2019ve noticed, when Lucas is off stage he\u2019s cuter and more childlike, compared to his more mature and sexy demeanor on stage. So, in conclusion, these could be all of the reasons the members call Lucas Xuxi. ",

            "answer_text": "Lucas actually has 4 names. One being his stage name, two being his birth names, and the last is his Korean names Lucas (is correct of course, \ub8e8\uce74\uc2a4 in korean)Hwang Wook-hee \ud669\uc6b1\ud76c (His Korean name)Huang Xuxi \u9ec3\u65ed\u7199 (One of his birth names)Wong Yuk-hei (His other birth name)Why do the other NCT members call Lucas \u2018Xuxi\u2019? As you can see \u2018Xuxi\u2019 is his birth name and Lucas is his stage. So maybe during trainee days he never picked his stage name and therefore introduced himself as his birth name, Xuxi or Yuk-hei. And i guess it just stuck. Key word *Maybe* Also in my opinion it\u2019s kind of cute and suits his off stage personality well. Xuxi  Lucas  Hope this helped Edit: Spelling mistake Thank you Jasmine Jones ",
