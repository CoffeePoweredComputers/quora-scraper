            "answer_text": "Sure there is. Look at the rock band Three Days Grace. Its former lead singer Adam Gontier was loved by everyone and when he eventually left the band in 2013, even though the band had to face some backlash, they got over it. The people now love Matt Walst (The new lead singer for 3 Days Grace). Same is for Linkin Park. Although the difference is that Chester didn't leave. And people also have no reason to give Linkin Park hate for changing the lead singer. In my opinion, they can easily continue on as a successful band. ",

            "answer_text": "Mike once said that he did sing just because Chester forced him to do and you know what the result is mike has become one of the fine rappers of all time. He also said he will always ask Chester that if he can sing correctly the answer Chester gave were so good that mike took it as a honour. Now even if they want to continue music it won't be that easier for them to do. And they can't replace Chester's place because Chester is irreplaceable. I honestly left listening to music which was a part of my life after Chester's death. Now-a-days music is shit ( imagine dragons not included they do good music) But Linkin park was love and Chester was life. #RIPchester ",
