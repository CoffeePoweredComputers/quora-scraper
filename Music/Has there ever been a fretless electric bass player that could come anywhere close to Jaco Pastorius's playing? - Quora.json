Alphonso is the real deal!\u201d Then Jaco would say- \u201cThere\u2019s one other tough mother fucker on fretless besides Alphonso..that Ralphe Armstrong guy! He\u2019s as tough as they come!\u201d So first- Alphonso Weather Report (Live) - Cucumber Slumber  Alphonso Johnson is a superb fretless bassist..he started out playing upright and replaced Miroslav on bass in Weather Report..he did two albums before Jaco joined and played on most of \u201cBlack Market\u201d as well..it seems that a lot of people don\u2019t know that!  Jaco played on \u201cBlack Market\u201d of course but not the entire album.(\u201cCannonball\u201d & \u201cBarbary Coast\u201d)  \u201dMysterious Traveller\u201d is an extraordinary album by Weather Report and Alphonso absolutely destroys on it! After Jaco joined Zawinul and Shorter, Alphonso went with Billy Cobham and George Duke.   A young pre Miles Davis John Scofield was also in the band on a Humbucker equipped Les Paul Junior! Make no mistake- This band was insane. Bill Cobham / George Duke Band - Red Baron Alphonso also plays fretted bass with authority-and he is accomplished on Chapman Stick!  Next Ralphe Armstrong  Ralphe Armstrong has played fretless with everyone..but most known to me is the third version of Mahavishnu Orchestra with Narada Michael Walden on drums..  Ralphe also has played a lot with Jean Luc Ponty these days..as recently as last August as far as I know! He is a menace on electric fretless and like Alphonso, started out on double bass..  This video I\u2019ve posted from YouTube is long..you don\u2019t have to watch the whole thing if you don\u2019t want to-but you should! LOL (Shout out to \u201cBig I\u2019ve\u201d and \u201cDetroit Bass Players\u201d from \u201cThe BassMint\u201d who put out innumerable bass videos on YouTube and recorded this video of Ralphe) BASSIST RALPHE ARMSTRONG INTERVIEW IN THE BASSMINT Here\u2019s a current photo of Ralphe from a Warwick advertisement  Alphonso Johnson and Ralphe Armstrong are my answer to your question..I truly believe that Jaco would agree with me too. Best! ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking if there's anyone who's played the bass as quickly, fluently and musically as Jaco, I would suggest, Michael Manring, Mark Egan (student of Jaco), and Steve Bailey to name a few.  With a little time you might even find a few unknown cats on You Tube.  However, this does no discredit to Jaco or his bass-playing legacy.  Jaco was and will always be a unique and monumental talent in the musical world due to his pioneering techniques, innovative creativity and monstrous playing of the bass guitar.  Jaco's playing made the bass guitar a lead instrument and opened the door for so many great talents who have continued to demonstrate the melodic value and versatility of this instrument.  His work on the fretless with the use of harmonics was (to my knowledge) unheard of before he came along (listen to Portrait of Tracy).  Pioneers pave a way for the next generations.  They take the biggest risks, the greatest falls, and sometimes never realize the significance of their work. Jaco taught us that anything is possible with this instrument.  Explore, ask questions, experiment and by all means, work your butt off to make it happen!  So, the fact that there are, in my opinion, a number of bassists who play as well as Jaco is a credit to Jaco and his legacy.  Although his bass-playing ability will be surpassed, Jaco's legacy is one that continues to grow with every innovative, hard working bassist throughout the world who has been inspired by this giant!

He wasn't a virtuoso like Jaco, but his playing never ceases to inspire me. His approach to the bass was absolutely one of a kind. To really hear what I'm talking about, I recomment Japan's \"Still Life in Mobile Homes\" from the \"Oil On Canvas\" live album. Also Pino Palladino and John Giblin are truly worth listening to. ",

There\u2019s two points for me here 1 - Jaco, like Hendrix, was the First. The first to bring revolutionary techniques and musical approaches to the fore. He reset the game. 2 - Jaco was more than \u2018just\u2019 a bass player. He was primarily a fantastic musician - both as composer, and arranger. There\u2019s a thousand bedroom YouTubers that can ape his level of technical proficiency, but none of them are even in the same musical universe as him. ",

Second, he came from a rhythm and blues background, and he brought this to the jazz world. ",
