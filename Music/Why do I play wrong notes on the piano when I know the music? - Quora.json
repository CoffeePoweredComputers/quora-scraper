            "answer_text": "I play lots of instruments and I do the same thing. That\u2019s why I, like most musicians, don\u2019t like to practice. That\u2019s why practicing is so HARD. Because to practice, you don\u2019t get to sound amazing, you have to slow down, look at the notes, and play the music a LOT, until you can play it through without ONE mistake. Then you can speed it up, and speed it up till it sounds like the amazing version we listen to! ",
