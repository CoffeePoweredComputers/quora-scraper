            "answer_text": "Let me lay out some stuff i\u2019ve read, and let u guys decide for yourselves. I think halloween in itself has a lot of things in common with witchcraft and sorcery, or at least it\u2019s commonly associated with it. There have been people who said it goes back to cult groups, and how it is a day to give offerings to the god of death in some traditions. Some people who practice witchcraft even say that it is their holy day, and they're happy that \"Christian parents let their children worship the devil at least one night out of the year\" (read the comments in Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? ) But with that said, many Christians still do involve in trick and treating: it's just a fun and enjoyable day for children to dress up, and give/take candies. Some might even say it teaches their children to share\\U0001f602 (okay weird logic but). So let's look at the Bible :) \"Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.\" Deuteronomy 18:10-11 NIV. The Bible makes it clear that no one should practice witchcraft, but halloween doesn't seem like it right?Let's look at verse 14: \"The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.\" God wanted the Israelites not to follow the other nations. As God\u2019s children and followers, God wants to set His people, us, apart from the rest, as His chosen people, a royal priesthood and a holy nation (1 Peter 2:9). What the world does, we do not follow. We hate what God hates. Do you think God hates witchcraft? Of course!If that doesn't convince you enough, let's go back to the greatest commandments in the Bible: loving God with all our heart, mind, soul and strength, and loving others as ourselves. 1 Corinthians 8 sums it up aptly: we shouldn't stumble others. If other people see us Christians, won't they be stumbled? They would think, \"Oh God allows withcraft and sorcery!\" Let\u2019s not only consider whether we can celebrate Halloween, but in doing so, do we stumble others and make them have false notions and ideas about God?Of course, I see that many of the other answers are much more evidenced and well backed-up by research online, but lets not forget as Christians, our most reliable source of evidence should be the unchanging Truth of God: The Bible. And indeed, although the history of Halloween may not be that bad, as pointed out by some users, the fact still stands that Halloween is commonly associated with witches and magic, which is something God detests. Hope that helps all of us :) ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone, including Christians, can celebrate this Fall Festival Let us reason - Why? Halloween is All Hallows' Evening. Halloween history is one of mystery and intrigue. The story of Halloween\u2019s past has been passed down through generations. Irish and Scottish immigrants carried versions of the tradition to North America in the nineteenth century. Ancient Celtic festival Samhain (pronounced \u201csah-win\u201d) is a celebration of the end of the harvest season in Gaelic culture. Ancient pagans took stock of their harvested supplies in preparation for winter. The ancients believed October 31 to be the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead which overlapped and therefore the deceased would come back to life to cause havoc, sickness or damage crops, as not yet harvested. However, this is the Day of the Dead and is about celebrating the dead, not being afraid of the dead. It is a holiday for people to honor their ancestors and loved ones who have passed away and invite those spirits back into their homes to be part of the family once more. It is a celebration of family and a show of respect for those who have passed away. In India, the beginning of the Fall Season is celebrated as 9 days of Navratri. Nava-ratri\" literally means \"nine nights.\" This festival is observed twice a year, once in the beginning of summer and again at the onset of winter. During Navaratri, Hindus invoke the Energy (Shakti) of God in the form of the Universal Mother, \"Durga,\" to mean the remover of miseries of life. It is this Energy, which helps God to proceed with the work of creation, preservation and destruction. The worship of Shakti re-confirms the scientific theory that Energy is imperishable and is always there. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure they can. Every year I used to have a big Halloween party, renting a hall for the occasion. Food, open bar, DJ, dancing, scavenger hunt, costume contests with prizes. My invited guests were primarily Christians (after all, most people who belong to a religion in the US are Christians). Oh sure there were a handful of pagans, pantheists, and wiccans. Oh, and six Jews, four Hindus, and two Muslims. And a few Agnostics and two Atheists. One of my regular guests was a Catholic priest, another a Methodist minister and his wife. I knew a guy who was a vodoun Houngan who moved here from Haiti, but he drove a limo and had a lot of business on Halloween. Mostly the same folks every year, and there was usually around 1oo guests. Most of the Christian guests were Catholic (two of which were Syriac rite), Lutherans, Episcopal, and Methodists. They all had a good time. No Satanic worship, no witchcraft (like there really is such a thing), no pagan orgies, no heathen sacrifices. Costumes varied. Vampires and werewolves (who don\u2019t exist either), Braveheart, Elvira, mummies, Cleopatra, Vikings, ninjas, pirates, superheroes, Dr. Evil, and the usual sexy nurse/policewoman/whatever costumes. Most of \u2019em have kids. I mean, sure they\u2019re all grown now, but back then they were kids. They has their costumes, went trick or treating for candy, and spent the evening showing their grandparents the load of sugar sweet booty they collected. The older kids went to supervised Halloween parties hosted by the local churches and the high school. They all grew up to be a wide variety of things, but of them became witches or warlocks or Satanists or bloody maniacs. Two became priests. So\u2026 your argument against it was what again? ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not. I am a devout Christian and I love Halloween. People who don\u2019t know about its roots see children dressed up as \u2018evil\u2019* characters and see it as people embracing the devil and unknowingly practicing satan worship. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong because many people who go about trick or treating don\u2019t know the history behind those scary masks. Samhain (saw-win) was/is the pagan Celtic holiday celebrating the end of one year and the start of another. It was the day the ancient Celts believed that the veil between this world and the next (think the world of the fae, the dead, etc) was at its thinnest and allowed the denizens from the next world into ours for one day. The Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos is predicated on the exact same concept, though that is celebrated the day after Halloween. Now, because the Celts knew that there were good and bad spirits who could come into this world, they would frequently wear masks so that the evil/bad spirits wouldn\u2019t recognize them and hurt them. Sometimes these beings would go to doors and ask for a, to use the modern vernacular, treat else they\u2019d leave a trick. Since those indoors didn\u2019t know who was who and , anyone who came to the door asking for a treat was given one- be the asker a human or something else. When the Christians came to Ireland they adopted Samhain into Christianity and declared it was also the night of the Christian holiday All Hallows Eve in which the saints, and martyrs are remembered by the Church. Over the ensuing centuries, the two rituals sort of emerged into one and we have the modern Halloween in which kids dress up in costumes and knock on strangers\u2019 doors saying \u2018Trick or Treat\u2019 to receive candy. *The parameters of what is evil and what is harmless I leave up to the reader ",

But what about if you're unsure or somewhere in the middle of those two positions, how should you decide what is the right thing to do? We can all see that the modern celebration of Halloween is focused quite heavily on darkness and evil beings. Here in the UK it's not quite so prevalent; it seems more like an excuse for adults to dress up and have a party as much as the kids do (although with more alcohol involved). American society has really taken the holiday to its extremes with some of the decorations I've seen online and on TV and films, to the point that suicide[1] and murder victims[2] left in public view have been mistaken for scary props! Origins of the holidayHas Hallowe'en always been like this though? Let's take a look at its origins to see where this holiday comes from to help us decide whether we should partake or not. Did you know that Hallowe'en actually started out as a Christian holiday (Holy Day[3])? \u201cHallowe\u2019en\u201d, or more precisely, All Hallows Eve (from the Old English hallowed meaning \u201choly\u201d), is an ancient holiday in the Christian calendar to mark the day before All Saints Day on November 1st. All Saints Day is a day to celebrate and remember the martyrs and all those who have died and gave their lives for the Faith. Originally, this yearly festival began in the 7th century when Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon[4], a Roman temple to the gods. This then became a church called St. Mary of the Martyrs, and the date of the consecration, May 13th, was to be celebrated annually thereafter as the Feast of the Holy Martyrs. This was then later changed to November 1st by Pope Gregory IV in 835 AD to commemorate the dedication of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to all of the saints. The feast day was then extended and made universal to include all the saints who had died, not just martyrs, since there had become too many to individually commemorate. And thus, All Saints Day was born. This isn't even the earliest time that martyrs were remembered as a formal event, as the practice goes way back to at least 135 AD which we can read about in the Martyrdom of Polycarp[5]. In it the believers are said to treat the bones of Polycarp as \u201cmore precious than the most exquisite jewels, and more purified than gold\u201d. The next reference comes around 250 AD. In Epistle 36 of Cyprian[6], he states that the Church should take note of the days in which the martyrs are killed: Finally, also, take note of their days on which they depart, that we may celebrate their commemoration among the memorials of the martyrs \u2026 there are celebrated here by us oblations and sacrifices for their commemorations There's also other early references to this practice in sermons by Ephrem the Syrian (373 AD) and John Chrysostom (407 AD), so we can see from the existing historical documents that celebrating the lives of martyrs and \u201csaints\u201d has been long observed within the Church, with the first record being in what is now modern-day Turkey. Aren\u2019t there pagan roots? There is often a lot of references to Hallowe'en being an ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced Sow-in, a Gaelic word meaning \u201cend of the summer\u201d), originating in Ireland over 2000 years ago. The story goes that this was always the time when the Celts celebrated their dead, and as Christianity spread, the Pope \u201creplaced\u201d the pagan festival with a \u201cChristianised\u201d version to try and convert people easier. But there are a few issues with this version of events, and the historical timeline that it\u2019s meant to follow. For starters, if it truly were an ancient Celtic festival, then the historical documents we have from the early Church should show that the initial celebrations of All Hallows Eve/Saint Day originated in Irish and Celtic populated countries. The ancient documents we looked at previously by Cyrian and about Polycarp et al. show us that these practices began in the area of Turkey and Syria, even if not widespread at the time. By the Middle Ages, the Pope was declaring this a Church-wide festival in May, which began in Rome (and again when the date was moved to November 1st). So we can see even from a brief look at history, Hallowe\u2019en celebrations originally had nothing to do with anything remotely Celtic. As far as Irish and Celtic origins go, we have still in existence a few Irish sources from around 830 AD which tell us that there was a feast \u201cof all the Saints of the whole of Europe\u201d on April 20th (Martyrology of Tallaght[7]) This should offer us some evidence that the Irish Christians celebrated All Saints Day (and the eve before) around the time of the original decree by Pope Boniface IV, as the news of the new date of November 1st had yet to reach Ireland from Rome. Plus there\u2019s also evidence that the name \u201cSamhain\u201d didn\u2019t appear until the 10th century in Irish folklore (Ronald Hutton\u2019s 1996 book Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain). In another book, Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, by Nicholas Rogers, he states that: Festivals commemorating the saints as opposed to the original Christian martyrs appear to have been observed by 800. In England and Germany, this celebration took place on 1st November. In Ireland, it was commemorated on 20th April, a chronology that contradicts the widely held view that the November date was chosen to Christianize the festival of Samhain. (p.22) Hopefully by this point you can begin to see that any supposed pagan connection to the original Christian celebration, and remembrance of the martyrs and saints, is either completely fabricated to discredit the Church, or is entirely coincidental. To read a more in depth overview of the history of these events, I recommend this article by a Lutheran pastor, Joseph Abrahamson: Hallowe\u2019en: A short history[8]. What about \u201cTrick or Treat\u201d, costumes and pumpkins? These aspects of the Hallowe\u2019en festivities do have mixed history, with some coming from Christian tradition in the Middle Ages, to others being older, Irish folktales. Trick or treating comes from an old Middle Ages tradition called \u201cSouling\u201d, where children or poor families would go around knocking on people\u2019s houses offering prayers for their departed (who were assumed to be in Purgatory), in exchange for \u201cSoul cakes\u201d \u2013 which were essentially doughnuts. This was common all year round for the poor, but obviously more popular during holiday times, and was often accompanied by a song or poem as well as prayers. Carving vegetables goes back to older times, but it was usually a turnip that was made into a lantern, and not a pumpkin. There is apparently an old Irish legend about a man named Jack in connection to pumpkins (hence, \u201cJack o\u2019lantern\u201d), though the connection to Halloween is much more recent. The same for dressing up in costumes, haunted houses and the phrase \u201ctrick or treat\u201d. All of these things originated in the early 20th century and eventually become commercialised throughout America and Britain, ingraining themselves firmly into society. Hallowe\u2019en then, as a holiday of dressing up as something ghoulish, carving faces into pumpkins, and trying to scare people in return for some sweet treats, is all a relatively secular and modern invention, with the more supernatural aspects hijacked by neo-paganism and claimed to be the older and ancient practices. In Conclusion\u2026 If you're going to church on Oct 31st and/Nov 1st to light candles in remembrance of the dead and to celebrate the lives of martyrs who gave their lives for the Faith, then great \u2014 you are keeping within ancient Christian tradition. But if you are dressing up as ghouls and depictions of evil and darkness, celebrating death over life, then you are partaking in something contrary to Christ and wholly secular, with possible pagan undertones. If we are to have anything to do with the modern/secular version of Hallowe\u2019en, then it should be as an opportunity to share the Gospel and be a light on a night of darkness, giving out the Good News rather than trying to scare people, sowing seeds of Truth rather than tooth decay. As an alternative, October 31st is also Reformation Day[9], as it marks the day in which Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses[10] to the Wittenberg Castle church doors[11] in 1517, and this year marks the 500th Anniversary of the Reformation. So if you\u2019re Protestant, you can always celebrate that instead. For \u201cwhat fellowship does light have with darkness?\u201d (2 Cor 6:14). We should do what we can to be \u201cin the world, not of it\u201d (Jn 17:14-16) and to \u201cabstain from every form of evil.\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:22) so that we may be a good witness to the eternal life that Jesus has given us, that victory over death and evil!

            "answer_text": "Definitely let me explain to you what Halloween is a celebration of. On the first Halloween evening a group of drunken pagans went out demanding tribute from the people in the countryside small Gifts of alcohol and money food whatever else appeased the pagans. but when the pagans came to a Christian family the Christians refused to give the pagans anything. The result is that the pagans killed the Christians. The two days following the night of the murder the Christians buried the Christian family that was killed and mourned in church and had a memorial service on Sunday. So as a Christian if you want to reenact a murder on Halloween evening. Then spend two days in church memorializing the dead Christians like it used to be done that's the way you would celebrate Halloween. ",

( By a quirk of the English language, the eve uses the older name for Holy, \"Hallows\" which is, itself, an older term for \"Saint.\" Now as to how one should celebrate the eve, recall that there are many ways Christmas Eve is celebrated. Often different ethnic groups celebrate in their own ways. Halloween is the same. Often age has a large impact on such celebrations. I certainly celebrate All Saints' Eve, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve much differently now than when I was thirty.

All Saints\u2019 Eve, as it is known, was a tradition the Catholic Church intorduced in that period there was still no real distinction between religion and magic, and Christiandom wasn\u2019t strong or organised as people think, so they had to \u201cabsorb\u201d former Roman and Celtic elements, and slowly turn them into something more meaninful for the believers. Halloween, or the Lemuria in Rome, were meant to appease the dark spirits of Fall, so they wouldn\u2019t haunt the living during the bad season. The day of the Dead and All Saints\u2019 are more or less the same, you praise for the dead to rest in peace, and for the Saints to vigil upon you all. ",

We did do a few fun things with apples etc. when I was a child, that\u2019s all. But now I just see it as a bit of fun that people need in the miserable autumn days between summer and Christmas. People get very creative about it, which is good, and it gives the shops some revenue which they need. My main problem ironically is the commercialisation, though! Far too much fuss. My other gripe is that this basically American style of doing things has overshadowed our more or less equivalent, Bonfire Night. And I just loved Bonfire Night. So, a compromise? Have fun, be creative, you don\u2019t need to spend too much if you don\u2019t feel like it. I think it\u2019s important for children (and we\u2019re talking about children) to join in with popular culture, so don\u2019t be too strict about it. If you are a Christian you can easily talk to them about the origins of Hallowe\u2019en, the importance of All Saints, the stupidity of superstition etc. ",

However, if you were previously involved in the Occult before your conversion and you interpret spiritual darkness in relation to the activities and images, then perhaps it\u2019s best to refrain from getting involved.
