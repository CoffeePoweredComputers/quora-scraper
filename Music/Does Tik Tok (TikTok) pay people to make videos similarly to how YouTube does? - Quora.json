            "answer_text": "The common way for short-video platforms like Douyin (TikTok) to seek for appropriate content creators is through MCN, which contracts with a number of quality content producers and online influencers. According to the standard from Weishi, a short-video App owned by Tencent, there are three ranking of videos, S, A and B. The video that receives over 50 Likes and 1000 Views can be ranked B-level; those with over 400 and 3500 Likes within 120 hours are respectively included to the A and S grade. The subsidy for each rank is RMB150, RMB 500 and RMB 1500. I think TikTok\u2019s strategy to attract short-video talent and enthusiast basically works similarly, but given that Weishi is still in an aggressive promotion period to grab the market share, TikTok\u2019s investment in content building will be relatively smaller, namely it may not pay the content author as much as Weishi does.
