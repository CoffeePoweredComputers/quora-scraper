            "answer_text": "I think a lot of why Michael's father abused him, had a lot to do with Joe himself. There is no excuse for what his father did to him. You don't beat your kid's into becoming the best, and what Joe did was not normal discipline, it was abuse! Michael had a inborn talent that his father did not have to beat out of him. Michael was just convinced by Joe that he did it for the good, how was it for the good? He messed Michael up for life. Michael always had mixed feelings for his father. One minute Michael would have an excuse for what his father did, and at other times he hated what was done to him, and threw insults at his father. Michael hated his father's way of how he did things, while being thankful to him for the things he taught them. Michael was never close to his father, he was afraid of him, and while Michael loved him, he could not forget the abuse done to him by Joe. Even after all of that, Michael still forgave his father. There are some children who could not have been treated like that and still forgive the parent, but Michael did. ",

            "answer_text": "His father would beat him as a kid and this was his way of discipline, his way of teaching his children how to do things good. I think Michael didn't diserve that violance, but on the other hand , it affected on how perfectionist he was and how he always gave his best. I remember something I've read from him. In a concert during History tour, he climbed on a bridge but something went wrong and the bridge fell. Michael hurt his back but not for a single moment did he stop performing. He imporvized it perfectly. Backstage he passed out and went to the hospital. Later, when asked how he managed to keep himself together on stage, he said: \"All I was hearing was my father's voice in my head saying: Michael, no matter what, never let your fans down.\"  He was thankful to his father for what he taught him, but not for the way he taught him. Anyway, he did forgive him, like he said himself. ",
