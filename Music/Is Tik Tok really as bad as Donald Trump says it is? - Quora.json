            "answer_text": "\u201cIs Tik Tok really as bad as Donald Trump says it is?\u201d It\u2019s almost axiomatic that if Trump says something is bad, then it\u2019s good, or at least not as bad as he says it is. The fuss about Tik Tok seems to centre on the idea that it allows the Chinese Government to spy on teens discussing their social lives, videos of animals being cute, and possibly videos exposing police brutality in various countries. I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t, but I also don\u2019t see why they would want to. More importantly: Do people really think that their communications on Twitter, Facebook, Quora etc. are secret? If the Chinese Government did want to know that some teenage girl thinks the boy in her video is cute and her friends agree, they could find out without any difficulty at all, whatever platform the girls used to express their feelings. Anything more important to the national interest than that won\u2019t be posted on Tik Tok. And why is it worse for the Chinese Government to know that American girls like American boys than for the American Government to know it, and also for the American Government to know that Chinese girls like Chinese boys? If spying on such matters is happening at all, you can be sure their own Government is involved. Trump\u2019s accusations are just part of his campaign to distract his supporters\u2019 attention from his own crimes and focus their hatred on the enemy du jour, in this case China. For Hitler it was Jews, for Trump it\u2019s China and brown/black people, but it really doesn\u2019t matter who the object of hatred is; the intention is to unite his followers (and maybe collect a few more) by capitalising on people\u2019s need to externalise their own fears in the form of hating and blaming some identifiable group for imaginary harm causing all their own problems. It\u2019s always worked and it\u2019s working now: Even some rational people are beginning to see China as an enemy of America. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. Not bad at all although some of the TikToks are pretty shitty. He just doesn\u2019t like the criticism of him that gets dished out. He especially hates Sarah Cooper. TikTokers also sabotaged his Tulsa event and TikTokers tried to downvote his election app to get it removed from the Play Stores. I don\u2019t know if they succeeded on getting it removed but it has really bad reviews and Trump\u2019s biggest concern in life is reviews. The thing is that Trump attacks the wrong things all the time. He doesn\u2019t get how things actually work. It\u2019s not TikToc it\u2019s people on TikToc. American\u2019s are dying of the Trump Virus because he won\u2019t get the whole country to wear masks and social distance. He\u2019s never even tried so it may or may not work but doing nothing won\u2019t change shit. Instead he blames Fauci or \u201cThe Democrats\u201d (whoever they are) or too much testing. Nuts. People keep trying to \u201cunderstand\u201d what he\u2019s doing but a psychotic is impossible for a normal rational person to understand. That\u2019s why they need to be locked up. No telling what they might do next and what might set them off. ",
