            "answer_text": "Business partners that became friends then (because of TuPac sharing his true feelings) became not so close friends. (I don't want to say they were enemies but they did fall out of favor of each other toward the end of Pac's life) TuPac and Dre were already rising stars becsuse of previous business in \u201cThee Industry\u201d. Dr Dre (because of his half brother) found Snoop and because Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight made a wise business decision to bail TuPac out of jail and then sign him to DeathRow Records They became part of thee biggest west coast gangsta Rap group since NWA and the rest is history. I guess what I'm trying to say is Snoop Doggy Dogg heard of Dr Dre and TuPac long before TuPac and Dre heard of Snoop. The professional answer to your question is \u201cBusiness Partners\u201d and \u201cLabel Mates\u201d. The \u201cHood\u201d answer to your question is \u201cHomeboys\u201d. ",
