            "answer_text": "I'm gonna do both female and male idols, I hope I make some of you question your sexuality, that's what happened to me\ud83e\udd23 Oh wait... Right, I'm already bi, wth am I questioning? I also put some really underrated idols. Plus, I know I put more male idols than female idols but it just happened to be that way. I simp over many more people but I didn't include everyone, this is just the ones that I simp the most and there's 16 people already \ud83d\ude02 Disclaimer: These idols I'm gonna talk about are in no particular order. I simp over each one equally. Seo Kang Joon Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, lips and eyes. Oh, did I say eyes?           He's more of an actor than a singer but he's indeed a member of a group called 5urprise. Kim Namjoon I die every time I see him smile. His dimple is deeper than Mariana Trench how am I supposed to just stand there and not simp?       And even when he's not smiling, he's still perfect! Who tf called him ugly?!     Hwasa Nobody's perfect? Think again.       SJHDJDHDJ SHE'S EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN A GODDESS I CAN'T EVEN FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW PERFECT SHE IS Amber Liu THAT SMILE!!! Amber and Ruby Rose both left the same effect on me, a.k.a \"turning gay\".     Keep smiling, Queen! Felix Lee Okay, now look at these photos.              Cute, right? He looks like child, doesn't he? He's actually very young, I think he's still considered a teena\u2013      Nevermind. Oh and now, be enchanted by his freckles!!!     Taeyong He's so cute like a little kid but I look away for one second and when I turn back he turns into a hot man, I don't understand.       And he looks good with everything, even as Taedoroki. (I am genuinely sorry for the dad pun.)  Hyunjin Honestly, this boy is prettier than the whole human existence, it's not even an opinion anymore, it's a fact. I don't know how many \"Hyunjin with long blond hair\" photos I have in my phone's gallery. How can a person be so attractive I DO NOT UNDERSTAND         Oh god, please don't do the tongue thing     Jennie Kim        They say her beauty is overrated and she's actually even ugly. I TOTALLY DISAGREE! I understand the haters though. They're jealous~ Young K        No, not the tongue again  He made me fall deep into those foxy eyes and I can't get out. Help.   Brian, why you gotta hit me like that? Jessi       I have a thing for tanned queens. She's one of them! I don't understand why do so many people hate her. Amazing personality, the face of a goddess and a physique that is HAWT asf, why would you hate her? Just because she got plastic surgery or because you're straight up jealous? Eric Nam           Honestly one of the most attractive guys I've ever seen. His smile is so beautiful it warms my heart\u2764\ufe0f Henry Lau         An absolutely gorgeous human being! He isn't just hot he also looks and acts so warm like I would like to cuddle with him 24/7 but I'm 15 years younger that would be so weird lmao Jackson Wang        Do I need to explain? Next. Jang Wooyoung            The dude is sooo underrated and he's definitely boyfriend material. I discovered him on Dream High and since then, I LOVE him! He slightly looks like Eric Nam though, doesn't he? Hansol Vernon Chwe   Dude, come on, don't bite your lip! You know my heart won't be able to survive\u2026        He looks like a mixture of Harry Styles, Leonardo DiCaprio and Shawn Mendes with a pinch of Asian blood lmao And on top of that HOT, CUTE, BEAUTIFUL, HANDSOME, EVERYTHING! Huening Kai A literal angel. Just look at him! His eyes, his nose, his lips, his hair, his cheeks, his WHOLE face!!!         He really has the prettiest nose I've ever seen. It's like crooked and all but still pretty!    (For the people who are ready to bash me; no, this isn't child abuse, I'm two years younger than him \ud83d\ude02) This took long because I updated my phone and now it's all different, I kept accidentally switching to hiragana keyboard\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But in the end, it was worth my time \ud83d\ude02 I accidentally burned my coffee it tastes so weird\u2639\ufe0f And Quora keeps crashing because I added too many pictures, I'm not even done yet\ud83d\ude02 Sorry for spamming here with pictures of attractive people\u2026 Or not. Bye! ",

            "answer_text": "*breathes in* breathes out*  My time has finally come to show you the list of idols I would probably sell my soul to for their talents, personality, and visuals. Before we start, I must present to you my Simp License to prove that I am eligible to simp over anyone I want so that the official organization of simping does not sue me  We\u2019re gonna do both the girls and the guys because both manage to make me collapse on the floor sooooo  1. The queen herself Hwasa  Me: *is on a test* My brain: HWASA Me: But I need to concentra- My brain: But HWASA Me: Good point If you are a K-Pop fan and are not obsessed with this lady\u2026 tell me your ways because ever since I watched Twit, my mind is Hwasa, and only Hwasa. Damn, I love her so much. Her voice, her visuals, her dancing, her confidence, her POWER. I strive to also have the balls to walk to the airport in front of thousands in my bra like- A few pics for those who also want to simp over this goddess:           I swear if perfection was a person\u2026 Boom, there she is.   2. The king himself Jimin  Me: I should talk to my friends soon! My brain: But someone just made a ten-hour loop of Jimin giggling in Western interviews. Also my brain: But I\u2019ll let you decide to get your priorities straight. Me: You\u2019re right. Jimin giggling for ten hours is clearly more important. I swear he may only be my bias wrecker but the power he holds over me is unlike any man I have seen in the past. A small part for his sexiness    but mostly because of how ADORABLE HE IS. He is literally the cutest boy I have ever seen in the history of humans like God must pick favorites or something smh           Jimin\u2019s mother deserves a Noble Peace Prize for creating him.   3. Our goddess Kim Jisoo  Me: I need to get my work done. My brain: And what is that work? Me: Scrolling through Jisoo\u2019s Instagram page for the 485028485th time today. My brain currently runs on Jisoo\u2019s high notes and heart-shaped lips and literally nothing else. Scientists have been looking through my DNA and they couldn\u2019t find anything but Jungkook sneezing and Jisoo saying \u201csorry, not sorry\u201d. I don\u2019t know who God thinks He is killing me by making Jisoo but here we are. Enjoy pictures of this beautiful woman:           She could run me over with a truck and I\u2019d thank her   4. Our adorable but dangerous angel Lee Felix  Me: Hello, 911? I would like to report that I was personally attacked by a man named Lee Felix. 911: Understandable, we were, too. I remember when I was a new K-Pop stan and Stan Twitter was obsessed with Stray Kids, Felix in particular, so I decided to listen to Miroh and I heard Felix\u2019s intro and I literally died. With a funeral and everything. He is our true king of duality.           Two words: his hands.   \u2018Kay, now that we\u2019re done with our main four, we will go on to our honorable mentions that are still the reason I breathe but not the reason I will die:    Yeji (Itzy)   HueningKai (TXT)   Jeongyeon (TWICE)   Jungkook (BTS)   Yooa (Oh My Girl)   Lucas (NCT/SuperM)   Chuu (LOONA)   Joy (Red Velvet)I can\u2019t believe I just exposed my daily thinking process to the internet. Anyways, these idols just make me wanna  :) ",
