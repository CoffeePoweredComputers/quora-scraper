            "answer_text": "Download a beat which you consider will resonate with your lyrics and find a studio around you. Don\u2019t record it home, no matter how good your microphone is. Pay the studio and record the voice. Read how other rap artists started, read interviews about their beginnings. Some sold eggs on grocery stores, some sold crack on the corner next to a grocery store. Get out of your head the idea of video for now. And if the beat belongs to Dre, Snoop, Arsonists or Jedi Mind Tricks it doesn\u2019t matter. You call it a freestyle and you won\u2019t sell it. If it\u2019s for you the rap game you will feel it after a few freestyles\u2026 Don\u2019t pay for instrumentals or videos. ",

            "answer_text": "If I were you, I\u2019d allow my smartphone to be my media center, especially this early in your pursuit/development of your art. With the iPhone, you can download the GarageBand app and import any instrumentalnon your phone and record vocals to it through the built in mic or with the mic on the Apple earbuds. (I guarantee android has an equivalent) Then you and some friends shoot some footage using the ProCamera app that you can then edit with the Videoshop add (which will also allow you to add your previously recorded song from GarageBand! Allow YouTube to be your Jedi young padawan!!! Good luck. ",
