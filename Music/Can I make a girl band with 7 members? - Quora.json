            "answer_text": "Yes! You can totally make a band with 7 people! In things like a Capella or maybe like a K-Pop type group, everyone can chime in do something. But if you are talking about something like a rock group, it might be a little tough. First things first is that it might be hard for every member to find something to do and have a voice in the band. For example, many bands have 2 guitarists, one bassist, a drummer, and a singer. But that\u2019s only 5 people, and you are reaching for 7. Maybe you can opt for two singers like Linkin Park and 3 guitarists like The Eagles, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s your choice. There are some pluses though with going with 7 people though. Bands like Arcade Fire have had lineups of 7\u201310 people, and in exchange makes their music sound pretty full and playing live isn\u2019t a problem because all of the instruments are there. Compare that to a band like Nirvana, who\u2019s studio stuff has a bunch of over-laying guitars, but live they only had 1 guitar, maybe 2. So yes, it\u2019s totally possible to make a 7-piece band, but it might be tough for every member to find a place in the group. Unless it\u2019s something like a Capella, then you\u2019re good. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm, seven members\u2026 Sure you could, but depending on what kind of band structure you want, it can be tough. The classic band structure is the four-piece Vocalist, Lead guitarist, Bassist and Drummer. There are also lots of five piece (two lead guitarists) and three piece (absent official drummer or bassist, with the work being done by an un-official support instrumentalist) bands. For there to be seven girls comfortably playing a different role in a band, you could add another instrumentalist, such as a keyboard player or another instrument that complements your genre (violins, pianos, organs etc.) The best bet for a diverse band line-up is: Vocalist, Lead guitarist 1, Lead Guitarist 2, Bassist, Drummer, Keyboardist/Synthesizer, and either a second vocalist or another instrument player However, your choice of what your band looks like matters most. Want it to be a purely instrumental band made mostly of guitar players? Go for it Want your band to have four different main vocalists? Go for it. Want your band to be some super niche genre band that uses instruments like oboes, didgeridoos and pipe organs all in one song? Go. For. It. Just remember to have talented musicians and a strong image to go with your band! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes you can, it all depends with the type of music you want to do and how gifted your girls are. For example if you are dealing with rock music,one rhythmist, bassist (guitars), one pianist,three singers and one drummer can serve the purpose.many genres of music can fit with seven members. But if you want to deal with more complex music you will need more members,these may include jazz,choir songs among others. ",
