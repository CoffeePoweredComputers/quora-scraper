            "answer_text": "All Stray Kids members are very close, but I'd say Chan would be the closest with Felix. Chan's and Felix's friendship seems really special, like true, supportive and highly satisfying friendship. They have a lot of common personality traits and interests together too. They always help and lift each other up. They encourage each other. Chan, in 2020 Vlive, called Felix his soulmate, which is so precious. They're truly soulmates.

These two genuinely treat each other like brothers and you can see how emotionally dependant they are on each other, Chan has also indicated this multiple times. They call each other \u2018home\u2019 and I think both being from Australia give each other that home country comfort since they are in a different country now. Then there is the fact that both are most comfortable with each other as well. Their relationship is honestly really beautiful and pure. ",
