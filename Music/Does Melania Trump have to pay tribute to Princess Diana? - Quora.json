I\u2019m quite sure Melania is capable of conducting herself in a polite manner, but there\u2019s no need for an American to pay tribute to anyone in any foreign country. She won\u2019t need to curtsy, bow, grovel, pay obeisance, or anything else. ",

What kind of tribute would you suggest? trump\u2019s wife will be expected to behave civilly to the Duchess of Cornwall. I doubt anyone will ask much more of that of trump\u2019s wife. ",
