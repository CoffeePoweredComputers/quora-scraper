            "answer_text": "First of all I want to say that I am an ARMY & BLINK both. So according to me they both are excellent. But right now in social media specially in YOUTUBE the number of subscribers of BLACKPINK has crossed BTS .Though in case of number of fans BTS is at the top. Actually by fans they are called THE KING AND QUEEN OF KPOP. But EXO,TWICE,GOT7&RED VELVET are really very good.They have also made KPOP HISTORY. I have to say that BTS is the biggest group right now . In case of promotion and maturity in music BTS is very perfect ,even in MV shooting.BTS actually has most number of fans for their angelic ,magical,and unique voices ; awesome and inspiring lyrics; attractive MV THEME & dance movements; very friendly behaviour with fans; and being very talented, cute & good looking. In other hand BLACKPINK sometimes do rude behaviour with their fans. Also haters\u2019 rumours about the girls distract many BLINKS to unfollow them. Blackpink have worked with many famous artists like LADY GAGA, CARDI B, SELENA GOMEZ. BTS also have done same ,but I think their behaviour and different personality is the most thing to make them so popular. Thogh I would like to say that, how much fame BTS have collected in these long seven years BLACKPINK have collected in a very short time (only four years). We should say , \ud83d\udc9cBTS\ud83d\udc9cis the biggest boy group and \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udda4BLACKPINK\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udda4is the biggest girl group. But atlast I would say RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST GROUP IS BTS.\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c   ",
