            "answer_text": "Some things to look out for, roughly in descending order of seriousness: Chipped or dented labium - this is the lip that splits the airstream to make sound, visible through the channel on the front of the head joint. Any damage will have an immediate effect on the sound, and it can be impossible to fix without rebuilding the entire head joint. Avoid buying an instrument with any defects to the labium. Image source. Snapped tenon - the tenon is the part of one joint that slides inside another. If the recorder is knocked or dropped, it can snap off - particularly on thin-walled wooden recorders. It usually requires a complete rebuild of the whole joint.Cracks or splits in the wood - these aren\u2019t always fatal, but they are difficult to repair and also best avoided.Damaged keys - snapped keys are difficult to repair in any useful way but easy to replace. An experienced technician should be able to acquire (or build) the replacement parts. If the damage is just to the spring, it\u2019s relatively straightforward to drill out the spring and replace it.Worn thumb hole - this is common on (particularly wooden) recorders that have had a few years\u2019 play. Some players have a tendency to dig the thumbnail into the wood when half covering the thumb hole. Putting a wooden or plastic bush around the hole is a straightforward repair for an experienced technician. Image source. Other worn or damaged holes - these are less common because the thumbnail mechanism (see above) doesn\u2019t exist, but they can be treated in the same way.Missing or badly sealing pads - again, a routine repair, but definitely not one to try at home unless you have the experience.Teeth marks in the beak - almost inevitable in a recorder that\u2019s been given to a child at any point in its life. Will not have an effect on the sound but can make the instrument less pleasant to play. Depending on the seriousness, can be sanded out, filled or ignored - but will certainly affect sale value.Loose joints - these are common on older instruments, particularly when stored in dry conditions. The tenon cork (or string, on some instruments) can become compressed or may be missing entirely. If the tenon is otherwise in good condition, replacing the cork is but a few minutes\u2019 work for a technician.",

            "answer_text": "The joints are loose. This can often be easily repaired. On a wood recorder look for cracks they go all the way thru. Also on a wood recorder that has a thumb hole the back look to see if it seems to be excessively worn. This can also be repaired if the instrument is valuable otherwise it's probably not worth it. If it has keys usually only on large recorders tenor and bigger make sure they are closing properly. The pads may need to be replaced if the do not seal well but this is easily don't be an woodwind repair person. ",
