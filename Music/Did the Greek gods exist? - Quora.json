            "answer_text": "Since the victors write the history, I tend to be skeptical of all historical accounts prior to the Renaissance period. The American educational method is to teach history in a linear fashion, citing events and years, but to obtain a full picture I try to view history as a puzzle with pieces that need to be put together. How do you piece your puzzles together? One viewpoint? One source? I like going \u201coff-script\u201d at times, on certain subjects when I feel it is warranted. After studying the Classics, and sourcing information from multiple sources, I tend to believe the Greek Gods were not mythological. Timaeus/Critias Quotes  A Dweller on Two Planets Published in 1894   Why? In short, for the same reason in the bible that every other chapter an angel is around every corner. In the very ancient world, angelic forces interacted with mankind much more frequently. What are the names of the angels in the Bible? In a \u201cpure\u201d academic sense, I connect Plato\u2019s dots. Most historians agree Plato absolutely did exist and he writes about a landmass called Atlantis. Decide for Yourself: Is Atlantis Real or Fiction? I don\u2019t think Plato was making up fiction. According to Plato and later many so called mystics, Atlantis was at one time a very technologically advanced society, but according to accounts they abused their power to such an extent they destroyed themselves. What exactly were they doing? They had decoded the human genome far surpassing our present knowledge, and were experimenting and then breeding chimeras, half man half beasts, mixing the sacred, with the foul etc.  Theseus Killing the Minotaur  Piecing all of it together using multiple sources, I think the Greek \u201cGods\u201d did exist. Another example might be the \u201ctales\u201d of Giants in the ancient world. Opening the mind, stretching the mind, and sourcing information from multiple sources off the academia only \u201cmap\u201d, it becomes clear that it would be very difficult for certain things to \u201cnot\u201d have existed and transpired. 3,000-year-old artifacts reveal history behind biblical David and Goliath It was a much different world back then.  Giants are mentioned in the Bible in several places (e.g., Genesis 6:4; Joshua 12:4). Og, king of Bashan (Deuteronomy 3:11); the giant people in Canaan that Moses\u2019 spies reported (Numbers 13:30\u201333); Goliath (2 Samuel 21:19); and the Anakites (Deuteronomy 9:1\u20132) are all examples of giants in Scripture Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath. Also it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite Amos 2:9\u201310 The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. They were also regarded as giants [Hebrew rephaim], like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim Deuteronomy 2:10\u201311  ",

            "answer_text": "Well I can probably say that yes they are I have such an account of these gods with Indians Well before Alexander the great there was another great warrior who tried to invade whole world and this time he was none other than son of Greek God Zeus son Dionysus. Dionysus\u2019s last big adventure on earth, before he became a full-time god: he decided to invade India. Why? Why not? He had traveled all over the Mediterranean and into Egypt and Syria, but whenever he tried to spread the good news about wine farther east, he always got stopped by angry locals. Maybe that\u2019s because Mesopotamia was where they invented beer. Maybe they didn\u2019t want any beverage competition. Anyway, he decided to make one final push to expand his market share. As far asthe Greeks were concerned, India was pretty much the end of the world, so Dionysus decided to go there, take over, teach them about wine, and come back home, preferably in time for supper. His drunken followers gathered by the thousands. Some stories say that Hercules joined Dionysus for the expedition, and they had some major drinking contests along the way. Other stories say that the twin sons of Hephaestus, the Kabeiroi, rode into battle on a mechanical chariot and fought bravely. A couple of times, they got a little too brave and were surrounded by enemies, at which point Hephaestus himself had to come down, spray the enemy with his divine flamethrower, and bring his kids back tosafety. Dionysus rode at the head of his army in a golden chariot pulled by two centaurs. A lot of towns surrendered to him in Syria. The drunken army made it all the way to the Euphrates River and constructed a bridge to get them across\u2014 the first time Greeks had gotten that far. The bridge isn\u2019t there anymore. What did you expect? It was made by a bunch of drunks. It probably fell apart in about a week. Everything was going great\u2014until the army reached India. Those Indians knew how to fight. They had their own magic, their own gods, their own bunch of nasty secret weapons. Their holy men, the Brahmans, would sit on the field of battlelooking all peaceful, and Dionysus\u2019s army would roll up, thinking the enemy was surrendering. As soon as the Greeks got close, the Indians would fire rockets into their midst\u2014jets of flame and blinding light, massive explosions that caused panic in the troops. After a bunch of tough battles, Dionysus finally made it to the Ganges River, which was the holy river of India. He assaulted one last fortress\u2014a big castle on a hill as tall as the Acropolis back in Athens. His centaurs and satyrs tried a frontal assault, climbing up the rocks, but the Indians set off some magic explosions that were so powerful the Greek front lines were vaporized. Supposedly you can still see theafterimages of satyrs and centaurs burned into the cliffs where the battle happened. At that point, Dionysus decided enough was enough. They\u2019d made it to India. They\u2019d introduced wine. Dionysus had collected a sweet assortment of exotic predator cats, like tigers and leopards. He\u2019d even taken the leopard as his new sacred animal and started a fashion craze by wearing a leopard skin as a cape. The army had taken a lot of treasure. They\u2019d met new and interesting people, killed most of them, and generally had a good time. Dionysus built a pair of pillars on the banks of the Ganges to prove that he\u2019d been there. He bade the Indians a tearful farewell and marched back to Greece. Hedropped off a load of treasure at the Oracle of Delphi in honor of the gods, and for a long time, there used to big silver bowl in the Delphic treasure room inscribed: TAKEN FROM THE INDIANS BY DIONYSUS, SON OF ZEUS AND SEMELE. Well that is all that I know. I hope it will be helpful as it proves that both Hinduism and Greek religions were true. I also think that it is a quite disappointing thing that even after winning such a great war we didn't even care to know about it. I hope it is helpful. Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "It seems I\u2019m the first one to post a sane answer to this question- No, the Greek gods do not exist, no gods exist. That is the only rational conclusion not simply because of the lack of evidence, but because of the EXTREME lack of evidence, considering the concept of \u201cgods\u201d. I can\u2019t conclude an asteroid the size of a baseball did not hit the Earth last Tuesday simply because of the lack of evidence, because I could have missed a report, or it could have happened somewhere unnoticed. I CAN conclude an asteroid the size of Michigan did not hit the Earth last Tuesday because of the lack of evidence. What is the difference? Something as huge as that would not go unnoticed. If there was anything that was even remotely worthy of the word \u201cgod\u201d to describe what it is, we would have noticed it- just like all the people in the Greek Myths saw and interacted with the Gods all the time.

However as a Hellenic polytheist I believe they do exist but I can not know for sure, nor can I provide any kind of testable proof. Nor do I think anyone should just take my word for it. As a polytheist I generally believe all gods exist unless I have a reason not to. As a result while I believe in Zeus, I do believe that Iovis Pater is not a seperate god but the same one just understood by a different culture. O believe that Athena and Minerva are the same goddess, as are Hecate and Angelos, or Hermes, Mercurius, and Thoth. ",

Okay, so, Greek gods. 12 Olympians, more primordial deities, a few titans and a shitton of minor gods. Did they exist? I don't think so, however, if I had to believe in one religion, it would be this one. That sounds weird, but hear me out. What seems more logical, one all-loving, all-knowing God who let's us wage war and destroy ourselves, or 12 major gods, none of which are all-knowing or all-powerful. They fight among themselves, they let humans wage war in their name. Ares even is the god of war, he is stronger when there is war, so of course he wouldn't interfere. ",

And this is not possible as we have named various products after the name of the god so they cannot be forgotten completely. The name of various elements and medicines are derived from Greek words . So we recall the name of the gods accidentally in our day to day life. It is up to one's believe weather they believe in god or not. If u believe in god they do exist else doesn't exist. Greek mythology is one of the oldest mythologies and it has its own followers. Since there are people who believes in old legends and the stories , the God exists . Mythology means that the stories mentioned in the books had taken place but there is no proof that they happened. But there have always been believers of those deities . All the gods have their temples and people worship them . Those people who worship them do believe in their existence . So yes the gods do exist and they would continue to exist till their existence is being remembered. And yes Greek gods are a reality. ",

Prayers to the Greek Gods, particularly Apollo, don\u2019t focus on sin, but on health, seeing that errors in judgement and mindset often cause pain, injury, and illness. They ask that the mind may be cleared so that the natural processes can heal the body. As for making them \u201caliens\u201d like Thor and Marvel Comics, Star Trek stories posited their being such beings that came to earth, but that\u2019s another fiction altogether. I work with Greek priestesses and priests and as a chaplain, for those who are called to faith in them, they are real. The Gods and Goddesses call their followers as much as the God of the Hebrews and Jesus. ",
