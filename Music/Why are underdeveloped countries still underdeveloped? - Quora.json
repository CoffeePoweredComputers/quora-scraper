            "answer_text": "There are deep institutional, economical and political structures that prevent countries from overlapping their current situation. Underdevelopment kind of reinforces itself: is a vicious circle that\u2019s very hard to escape from. This vicious circle is based upon weak and corrupt institutions, giving no incentive to invest and save, since is simply easier to \u201chop\u201d on the shoulders of a political padrino, and the inequality in the access to the state services (the state is mostly at the service of middle and high classes, leaving out a huge percentage). The lack of investment and savings prevents the rise of a more complex, knowledge-intenvise economy, reducing the areas where an individual can be effectively succesfull outside from the state. The same way, the technological development of the high-income countries attracts other kinds of similar investments, since whatever you need is already there. This is known as the \u201cagglomeration process\u201d and basically means that is harder to start an economic sector than to make it grow. And also, that economical activities concentrate themselves, making it very hard, say, for Angola, to develop an internal technological sector, whereas in Silicon Valley or the Korea-Japan axis this sector just grows orrganically. There is no mistery as for why underdeveloped countries stay underdeveloped. The real question is HOW have some of them surpassed this structures and joined the high-income countries. There are not many examples of that (Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Singapur, maybe you could also fit here the ex-british colonies: Australia, Canada and NZ; also, maybe you could fit here the nordics, but that\u2019s about it). ",
