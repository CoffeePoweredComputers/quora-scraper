That means you have damaged them and you shouldn't push any more luck. Remember it's irreversible. Once it's gone it's gone. I've seen plenty of guys who worked in loud sites and warehouses and they can't hear shit. All because they didn't wear protective gear. ",

In the 70\u2019s I used to go to a lot of pop concerts and my ears would be ringing for about three days afterwards, Yes, Wishbone Ash, Focus and so on. No I am lucky I am not deaf or impaired so far. Wise up, one day you are going to be old and if your hearing is screwed so are you. Take care. ",
