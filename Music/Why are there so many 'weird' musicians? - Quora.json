            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of weird. All creatives are weird, if your definition of that word means that they generally don't give af what others think of them, they have a drive to express themselves, and the talent to not just think outside of the box, but they have no box, yeah, that sounds about right. My daddy was a musician, I'm a singer, my daughter writes and sings, and my son is a budding artist, and we're all weird. Well, daddy isn't with us anymore, he went Home in 2012, but yeah, he was weird, he had a very colorful life. Drums were his primary instrument, though he sang as well, and played bass, banjo, and steel guitar. He played with a lot of famous people, imagine a little girl answering the phone and Muddy Waters calling your daddy to wish him a happy birthday. True story. I remember Jerry Lee Lewis and Kenny Rogers calling for daddy, wanting him to play on their tours. My dad wore loud clothes, and was totally cool, but he always drank, and when he did he got mean. He finally stopped drinking, and then we repaired a contentious relationship. He was married 11 times, my mama was number 7. He had 5 legal children to 3 different mamas, and a brother who lives in California found us a couple of years back, and yes, he looks like my dad a lot. I'm quite sure that I have more brothers and/or sisters, but I have no idea where they might be. It turns out that his daughter, my niece, is a famous You Tuber. I told my brother that he was actually lucky to not be raised by our dad. I loved my father very much, was daddy's girl, but he was frightening when he drank. I grew up in a dysfunctional house with a very young mama who wanted to keep her family together, but she had to divorce him to keep us safe, as he was starting to threaten me as well as her. I know now that my dad probably had ADHD, ADD, or was bipolar, and he was self medicating. But he eventually got well, as I stated earlier, and although he cheated on all his wives (a lot of times when I was an adult he would tell me that he had a girlfriend, making me really uncomfortable) he didn't touch a drop of alcohol for the last 25 years or so of his life. I had an alcohol problem when I was young, but stopped when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. I wasn't going to let my daughter grow up with an alcoholic mama. As a result, my daughter and my son have no plans to drink or drug. They know that doing drugs or drinking will screw up their dreams, so they choose not to. My daughter and son are too busy creating to worry about that. Sorry about the length of my answer, but it seemed necessary to point out that these \u201cweird\u201d musicians are people too, with lives you'll never know about, and things happening to them just like everyone else, and sometimes the way they were raised has a lot of influence on them as an adult. I've read book after book about famous musicians, and so many were the products of dysfunctional families or bible thumpers. There's a lot of things that make people \u201cweird \u201c and you don't have to be a musician either. ",

            "answer_text": "Long answer: Unlike the sciences, music is an art. Of course, stable people do exist in the arts, but they are usually older, more accomplished, they are willing to grind several movements to make it into the orchestra. Most of the time though, they think that\u2019s too boring. They just want to be rock stars. There\u2019s a lot of attention seeking in this endeavor. You have to have the stomach for it even if you could strum a guitar and vocalize some chords. I have talented musician friends who are considered weird. Usually, when you are gigging or hanging out in live gigs you meet a lot of sociable people who end up just being imbeciles. You know, those that won\u2019t spend time talking about property investment, marriage or all things in life that make practical sense. They just love bullshitting a lot. Those type of people who are always in the bar. That life can be hard to swallow. Very few of them talk about their finances. Because when you are living the music life, you have to price something above just monetary gain, and that would lead you to become crazy or weird in everyone\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s like joining a cult, forgive the term. It really is. Personally, I don\u2019t recommend it. I play the piano, guitar and sing. But these are just hobbies. Short answer: It really doesn\u2019t take a lot of brains to be a musician ",
