            "answer_text": "Obviously, any answer people give here will be incredibly subjective. I will tell you my own personal favourite, but this should obviously be taken with a grain of salt, as many people will undoubtedly disagree (perhaps vehemently so). For my money, there is no better heavy metal band than Slipknot.  I\u2019ve been listening to Slipknot for over a decade now, ever since I stumbled onto a song of their\u2019s in a World of Warcraft pvp video, of all places. Why do I enjoy Slipknot? Firstly, because I feel that their larger ensemble of 8 members allows for a better and more complete sound, and more variance in their sound. And secondly, and perhaps most importantly, because I feel that their lead singer, Corey Taylor, is easily one of the most talented vocalists in the genre. He is just as capable of singing a ballad, as he is at screaming and roaring bloody murder. Whereas most heavy metal singers I\u2019ve come across seem to have no real range outside of screaming and growling, Taylor is very capable of genuine singing, and it shows it Slipknot\u2019s music. Certainly they have songs that fall under the banner of that typical \u2018screamo\u2019 rock, like \u2018The Heretic Anthem\u2019:  The also have plenty of great songs with melody and actual singing, like \u2018Dead Memories\u2019, or \u2018The Devil in I\u2019:   And then you have songs like \u2018Snuff\u2019 or \u2018Vermillion pt. 2\u2019 which are so soft and beautiful, you aren\u2019t even sure you\u2019re listening to the same band:   Again, this is all entirely subjective, and I have no doubt people will argue and disagree with my choice, but in my opinion, Slipknot is the best heavy metal band out there.

            "answer_text": "Soundgarden They may fall under grunge, which is seen as the lightest form of heavy metal, but their sound is unique even by the standards of the music scene that birthed them. They mixed the rawness of 70\u2019s heavy metal and hard rock a la Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, the ethereal notes of Cream and Velvet Underground, the intensity and angst of hardcore punk such as Black Flag and MC5, with the soulfulness of funk acts such as Ohio Players and Funkadelic. The dark introspection mixed with the sludge of heavy metal and airiness of psychedelic rock manages to capture the themes, moods, and atmosphere that Seattle evokes with its dense, evergreen vegetation and a cool climate characterized by mist and heavy rainfall. What highlights their unique sound is their knack for odd time signatures and atypical guitar tuning, which is unusual even by all the metrics of grunge that preferred raw aggression with strong moods over technical ability. Their Beatles and Tom Waits-inspired songwriting is easy to get into with the lyrics tending to evoke a soundscape with mental images instead of concrete subjects. Here are some songs I can show you of theirs: Nothing To Say  Flower  Fell On Black Days  Pretty Noose  This band helped to develop stoner rock and alternative metal as genres of heavy metal and hard rock. They were also influential on a number of progressive and experimental metal bands such as Mastodon, Boris, Between The Buried And Me, and Dillinger Escape Plan. Highly recommended if you feel like something heavy without planning to offend your neighbours and acquaintances. ",
