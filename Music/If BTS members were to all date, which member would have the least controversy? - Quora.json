            "answer_text": "ohoho; novel ahead guys. didn\u2019t expect to type this much, but i guess i have lots of thoughts on this topic. \u2014 so, i\u2019m sure pretty much anyone would agree that the hyung line would be less controversial and the maknae line would be more controversial. as others have mentioned, hyung line stans tend to be older & more mature on average. (and to be 100% clear, i\u2019m not saying this as an insult to anyone. that\u2019s just the way it goes typically. i was pretty much the same way towards anyone who i was stanning 9\u201310 years ago. i\u2019d find fault with anyone around my age thinking immaturely, but how can anyone fault like a 11ish-14ish y/o for being immature?) \u2014 all that being said, in order from least controversial to most controversial: jin: i mean he\u2019s the oldest, and he\u2019s getting to the age where it\u2019d be totally expected for him to have a significant other. not to mention the fact that jin has a personality that would be viewed as charming to just about anyone, regardless of their personality. even without him being incredibly rich and famous, i\u2019m sure it\u2019d be easy for him to find a partner that he fits with. so yeah, if it were revealed that he\u2019s in a relationship, i don\u2019t think i\u2019d even bat an eye at it.hobi: i definitely think it would be more of a surprise when it comes to hobi, due to age & personality (like from what we see, he\u2019s very extroverted & it can be harder to find someone you\u2019re compatible with if you lean more heavily to one side of that spectrum, in comparison to someone like jin who seems to sit pretty in the center). but a big (sad) factor that also comes into play is, that hobi is pretty under-appreciated/underrated. it hurts my heart thinking about it because hobi literally deserves the world, but on the flip-side i think he would get more leeway in a circumstance like this. also, hobi stans literally always seem to be the most laid-back all around.joon: so for joon, i\u2019m kinda looking at it from a different angle. joon's totally a hopeless romantic, so no surprise there. that being said, he is the leader and i think because of that, he would be the most cautious about letting anything like this get out in the first place. basically, wouldn\u2019t be surprised about the relationship itself, but i would be surprised if it got outed to the public. for this reason, i think it\u2019d be a bit more controversial than jin or hobi.yoongi: for me, i think yoongi would be more controversial than the other hyung line members because it would be the biggest surprise in comparison to the other six. just the same as hobi, he leans more heavily to one side of that E-I spectrum. and leaning more heavily to the introverted side adds an extra layer of complications in terms of relationships. speaking from a similar perspective, getting into a relationship can be challenging & maintaining that relationship is even more challenging. even when matched with someone who appears to also be introverted/claims to be introverted. it\u2019s all fine and good until you get into a relationship with them & all of a sudden they\u2019re questioning why you want to spend a good chunk of time alone (anyone else or is that just me?). of course, yoongi stans tend to be laid-back as well, but i feel like objectively speaking, the shock factor would be quite a bit larger than any of the other members.the maknae line: yeah, ya know, i really tried to figure out which between the three would be the most and least controversial, but i couldn\u2019t really come to any solid conclusion. all three tend to be judged on a harsher scale in regards to absolutely any personal decision. and of course, i\u2019ve already mentioned the fact that they do have younger stans on avg, but i\u2019ve certainly seen my fair share of older maknae line stans with a similar attitudes to the younger stans. like older hyung line stans who are immature are few & far between in comparison to older maknae line stans. of course, there\u2019s plenty of mature maknae line stans young & old, just less of them it seems. i\u2019m not quite sure why this is. like, yes, the maknaes are younger, but they\u2019re in no way, shape, or form too young to be in a committed relationship or make their own choices. even if one of them were to make a poor choice, like\u2026yeah that\u2019s pretty par for the course in your early twenties. i\u2019m in-between kookie & tae age-wise, so i\u2019m feeling that as i speak. all that being said, yeah, i think they\u2019d all be on pretty equal footing here. jimin seems to have the highest number obsessive stans, just from my observation, tae seems to be nit-picked pretty harshly these days for whatever reason, and kookie gets babied by a good chunk of the fandom. i don\u2019t see any of them getting out of a situation like this without it being a huge ordeal. it\u2019s incredibly unfortunate. my biggest hope is that if any of them are in a relationship/they enter into one in the future, it stays private. there\u2019s definitely a potential for it to turn into a dangerous situation for them or their partner, much more so than the other members, and that thought makes me sick.\u2014 so yeah, to summarize obviously this is all just my opinion. i really hope that at some point ARMY will grow as a whole & all this would be much less of a concern. i\u2019ve seen many ARMYs (on twt at least) talking about how they\u2019d be very happy if they were in relationships and i love that. i\u2019m right on-board with it also, as long as that\u2019s what the boys want. like even though stan twt can be incredibly toxic, i\u2019d say in general, stan twt is in agreement with this. on other platforms, this doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to be the case. but if ARMYs are only able to come to a general consensus on a few of these issues, i think this NEEDS to be one of them.

            "answer_text": "I think it would be Hoseok.  From my experiences within the fandom, the members who would have the most controversy if they were dating would definitely be the maknae line since their fans are generally younger and less mature, and they have way more solo stans. The Hyung line would have less controversy for the exact opposite reasons which is that their fans tend to be older/more mature and most of their fans are still OT7. Generally, all the Hoseok stans I\u2019ve ever talked to tend to be really chill. I\u2019m not just saying this because I\u2019m Hoseok-biased! But seriously, for some reason, he doesn\u2019t seem to have so many delulu fans and the fans he has are a pretty loyal, level-headed bunch. It is very rare for me to see Hoseok stans in any drama and Hoseok himself is one of the most scandal-free people in BTS. A good example of the attitude Hoseok stans/ARMYs have towards him dating is when at the start of the year, Hoseok did a v-live where he talked about his ambitions for the year.  He talked about wanting to be a special person for someone. Although some people say he wasn\u2019t speaking in romantic terms, the majority of the fandom interpreted it as such and so we got to see their reactions to such an idea.   If you scroll down to the comments underneath the video, every single comment is like this! I haven\u2019t seen a single negative comment about the idea of him dating and that says a LOT about the mindset of both Hoseok stans and ARMYs in general. The fact that it didn\u2019t become a scandal either is pretty mindblowing since I can imagine if Jungkook said something similar, he would literally be hung, drawn, and quartered by a lot of his fans. We should all be happy for BTS if they find someone that makes them happy. They deserve it! \u2014Sani ",
