I assume that's what you mean by \u201clinked contacts.\u201d It's certainly possible that there is some kind of social media app that allows communication by way of entering someone's information into the app. That's kind of how social media works. It still wouldn't allow them access to your phone. What is not possible is someone spying on your phone through the contacts app that comes with the phone. ",
