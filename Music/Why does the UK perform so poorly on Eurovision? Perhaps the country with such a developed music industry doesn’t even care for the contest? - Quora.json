            "answer_text": "Over the 60 or 70 years this appallingly embarrassing \u201ccontest\u201d has been running, Britain could have fielded scores of world-class acts - Beatles, Bowie, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Kate Bush, Queen, Oasis, Bee Gees, Tom Jones, Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran\u2026 make up your own list. We still would not have won much. Firstly , for most of that period the judges were \u201cprofessionals\u201d and the average East European (say) simply does not get British music. Secondly it is political, with countries supporting their allies and voting against their enemies regardless of the song - Greece and Turkey never give each other points; the Scandinavians always always love each others\u2019 songs. More recent phone-in voting by the public has made this worse, not better. 3.5 million Turks living in Germany are a force to be reckoned with, for instance. Thirdly, although it is (at least officially) a songwriting contest, there is far too much emphasis on the performance rather than the song. A disproportionate number of \u201cnovelty\u201d acts therefore participate. And of course the phone-in public don\u2019t care about that anyway. So half-decent songwriters tend not to bother. From a British perspective, any serious artist would regard Eurovision as career suicide, with considerable justification. The last time winning Eurovision led to a serious career break for anyone was 1974 (Abba, with \u201cWaterloo\u201d). I have no idea why we continue to enter it. Italy gave up on it years ago (reasonably recognising Verdi and Puccini had better tunes), but sadly re-entered the zoo a couple of years ago. P.S. None of this should detract from the fact that Britain actually enjoys treating the whole thing as a huge joke. Our commentary feed from Terry Wogan and then later Graham Norton, is brilliant. Many of us attend boozy parties to watch it together and fall about laughing. We don\u2019t really understand why anybody should take it seriously, but apparently some people still do. ",
