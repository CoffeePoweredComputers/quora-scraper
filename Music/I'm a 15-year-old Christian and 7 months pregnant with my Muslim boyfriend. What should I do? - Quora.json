They need to get you adequate medical care because you\u2019ll be giving birth soon and that\u2019s going to be a rough experience. You haven\u2019t got much time to decide whether you\u2019ll keep the baby or give it up for adoption and even less time to prepare. Do NOT expect your boyfriend to stay. Do NOT expect to get any financial support or other help from him. It\u2019s got nothing to do with religion. Teen boys typically lose interest once a baby arrives because a girl is no fun anymore\u2014she\u2019ll be lucky to get two consecutive hours of sleep because the baby\u2019s demands are constant. She has no time or attention for a boyfriend anymore. Rely on your parents now. They\u2019ll be there for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 17 years old and I got pregnant at 16. This is what I\u2019m going to tell you so listen closely. You are not a \u201cslut\u201d you are not a \u201cho\u201d or a \u201cwhore\u201d because people are going to forever say these words to you. Talk with your parents. Sit down with them and have a vulnerable conversation. Speak about your baby. If you wanna keep it tell them. If you want to give it up for adoption ask them for their support. But if you keep that baby you love it with all your heart. It\u2019s going to be extremely hard in the beginning. You won\u2019t be sleeping, you feed your baby every 2 hours, and you probably won\u2019t take a shower most days. You do what you think is the best for you. If you think that you don\u2019t have a good support system and your baby won\u2019t thrive with you then I would advise you to give that child up for adoption. It\u2019s gonna be scary. But you are strong girly!! I\u2019m cheering for you over here. If you have any questions or just wanna rant leave a comment and we can figure something out. It\u2019s okay to cry too. It\u2019s a hard time for you. ",
