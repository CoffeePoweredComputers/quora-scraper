            "answer_text": "I'd add a third \"technique\" - \"percussive guitar\".  Here's an article on the technique from music radar.  Also, I remember seeing a prior posting on Quora asking about who the major percussive guitar artists are. Andy McKee and Newton Faulkner percussive guitar As for taxonomy, I'd say:1. Fingerstyle - this is where the artist plays the whole song, melody in particular, but also rhythm and sometimes percussion.  There are many artists in this category.  I like Tuck Andres in particular.  There is also a website called Lickbyneck Learn The Guitar Visually. Play The Guitar instantly! Teach The Guitar Globally! that has a lot of free tab for finger style and a neat visual midi app. 2.  Techniques -- There are a number of \"techniques\" that can be applied when you're playing fingerstyle.  These techniques aren't limited to finger style, but often help because you're trying to fill in for so many parts e.g. drums/percussive.  These techniques include tapping, percussive, two handed guitar (a kind of tapping - but a bit more because you're playing chords with your right hand). For tapping/two handed, I've always loved Stanley Jordan.  For percussive, I love Gabriella from Rodrigo & Gabriella.  I'd also argue that percussive guitar decended from percussive (funk) bass.  Being a bass player initially, its been very helpful to know those techniques and apply them to guitar.  See artists like Larry Graham, Louis (Thunder Thumbs) Johnson or Victor Wooten.  Victor in particular has some great videos breaking down his techniques - double thumb, and multiple finger pluck, that can be applied to guitar.       Victor also mentions applying different techniques from different instruments in one video.  I think this is very applicable because percussive guitar is really adding \"hand drumming\" to the guitar.  So learning hand drumming techniques like the \"finger role\" from the doumbek, darbuka or tabla drums can help with your percussive techniques on guitar.    I agree with  you that this is a very cool technique.  I hope you enjoy learning it and we see you on YouTube someday. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to learn more about this style of guitar playing:  check out Ben Lacy. In my opinion; \u201cThe\u201d Master of a style that is not just simply \"finger style\" its finger style with simultaneous staccato beats and running base lines that you heard it with first seeing it you would expect that it was a 3 piece band playing.  Check out: Ben Lacy http://www.benlacy.com/  Ben calls his style \"Two handed groove\" and also \" Snap, Crackle and Po  Ben perfected his own style of playing almost 30 years ago and there others who may play something reminiscent of \u201c Two Handed Groove\u201d Ben usually manages to blow the minds of other masters of guitar.  I believe that Ben is not only the most prolific: (search for his originals and highly impressive cover songs on YouTube) He has performed with greats such as: Al Di Meola, Larry Coryell, George Duke, Joey DeFrancesco, and Phil Keaggy. (and this list is just scratching the surface)  Furthermore, he has shared the bill with Frank Gambale and Tommy Emmanuel. Not only is Ben great at what he does with this style, he can shred with the best of them and will blow most people away with practically any style of music.  Sure there are others: Stanley Jordan, Victor Wooten, Oteil Burbidge\u2026etc. However, there is still something about what Ben does that sets him apart. ",
