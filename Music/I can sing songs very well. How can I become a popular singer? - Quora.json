            "answer_text": "It\u2019s basically super rare like winning the lottery. Consider the following or ask yourself the following questions. What does singing mean to you? Why do you want to be a singer? If you can sing, you already are a singer! It\u2019s as simple as that. If you are not satisfied with that then all you are after is the FAME. The problem is that with the digital age, too many people are doing it now. Pre-internet was the best time to be great at anything period. This was true because most people didn\u2019t have the means to expose their talent. You literally had to move to LA or NYC or send in a demo or know somebody. Today everyone with a computer has access to broadcast themselves on the internet. When the internet first started getting attention in the 2000s it was still somewhat doable; that\u2019s how Justin Bieber got signed. Now EVERYONE is on youtube which means almost no one gets attention. Singing contests make singing a joke where millions of singers just want that fame, it\u2019s not about singing but they just want that celebrity life style and fame. Bottom line today is that too many people want to do everything. This is not just singing but there is competition everywhere. In the 80s and 90s, when the competition was less, mediocre talent could rise to the top. Today good is the new mediocre. You need to be exceptional and the only way to be exceptional is have things other than just singing like youth (as in teens) and good looks. If you haven\u2019t noticed, we aren\u2019t producing too many rock stars recently or people that can actually sing. All of the most famous people you see today got famous in the 80s, 90s or 2000s or sometime before that. Even if you get really famous today, it won\u2019t last more than a year or two because the public will get tired of you and go after the next pop sensation. Today people don\u2019t get famous for singing, it is all about hip hop and rap. If you want to get famous for music, that\u2019s what you need to do. People generally don\u2019t care about any other music. But don\u2019t let the fact that you might never be famous stop you. 99% of us are on that same boat. Also, the 1% that do make it, get exploited. It is really and literally just like they say, you indeed sell yourself out to get famous. If it doesn\u2019t happen to you, don\u2019t worry about it. Do you really want that life where you are famous for a year and then no one cares? Just sing for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the thing and this is gonna be a dose of reality. EVERYONE wants to be famous. EVERYONE wants the fame, the girls chasing and the million dollar checks. But just know that you are competing with a lot of singers all over the place. What makes you stand out like the others? That\u2019s the question. That\u2019s how you gonna get there. I have been doing this since 2015 and I have done well myself. My IG is wrkinsilence. So anyways. Here is how to be smart in this music business. Just know that it is not all about the singing and the creative process. You must have a sense of business and marketing. If you have both of those mixed together, you will succeed. If you don\u2019t have these, people will take advantage of your money including shady managers. They are out there waiting to screw an artist over. So be careful.Have a good image. No one wants to see a fat. ugly person singing. So get healthy, go to the gym and get the image that will attracts potential fans. I know it sounds really harsh but it\u2019s true. Especially if you want to be in Los Angeles, Hollywood, Beverly Hills. Have an image that will make people look at you twice. Be creative with it.Have a good voice obviously. The myth is that people are born with a voice. Anyone can sing even you. So go take voice lessons and improve on your strengths and weaknesses. Once you learn to accept your voice, you will feel confident. Practice every single dayHave a good social media presence. I would start with 2\u20133 platforms that you can manage. If you can\u2019t do it, find a team but it has to be people you trust. When you have a team, it works. So make a Instagram, Twitter, SoundCloud. Most people go there to listen to music and like music posts.Never think about going with the big contract labels. This is the truth. Big labels screw their artists over and control their creativity. Go independent because you will keep all of your royalties and have complete control of your creativity.Find a Distribution network like Distrokid, RouteNote. This will help your music reach streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon. This will also make your music available around the world.Collaborate with other upcoming artists. Notice I didn\u2019t say top singers. Because you need to start from the bottom. Support small artists and help them. When you do that, they help you back. Eventually it will go further.You must be a people person and have charisma. Be someone that people will want to be and look up to. No bragging or shoving accomplishments in their face. That will scare them away. Be the artist that is a role model to everyone. Be a part of humanity.Have Money. Because all of it will take money to make this happen. The distribution, the songs, the image, the studio time, the photographers, the videos, the team, the cover artwork. Without it, you won\u2019t do too much. Of course, you can learn how to do some of it by yourself but you must dedicate yourself.Learn Music Theory. It helps a lot. That way, you can sing to the beat on key without struggling.Be more than just a Singer. Be a music business person, learn how to produce your own beats, engineer your own song, promote your material/be active on social media, interact with other musicians. That way, you have more skills and you will have more things to offer.\\Last thing is Work Smart, not work hard. When you work smart, you get results. That\u2019s all of my tips of how you can start climbing up. Because right now, you are at the bottom with the rest of the beginners. All of the things I told you will build the foundation you need in order to climb. Without it, you will fall off and crash. Plus if you fail or lose motivation, it is a teacher and it teaches you a lesson. There will also be times where people don\u2019t believe you at all. They will crash you down. In that situation, never give up and keep going. Another thing is that you need to have a Plan B. Because in the end, it may not work out and you will have to fall back on a failsafe. Hope this helps you and good luck on your journey. Remember to have a good attitude in the worst of times and best of times. The willpower you have will get you through. That\u2019s the key. ",
