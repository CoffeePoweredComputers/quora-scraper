            "answer_text": "I have no idea what boat speakers are. Do you mean some sort of marine speakers? I can not help you there. All I can say is that the sound quality is a bit subjective. If you like them or, if they sound good to you that is what is important. I personally like JBL high end and many professional products, especially from a not too distant past. If you are talking about car audio speakers, to me, JBL can be a bit harsh in the high-frequency region. I prefer a more detailed and less aggressive sound. But this does not mean they sound bad. They sound fine for most people. As for the boat speakers I have no idea what you are talking about. There are several brands that sell marine speakers and depending on the brand and model, some can sound perfectly fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Which speakers has quality sound jbl or boat? JBL is a brand that offers speakers from really cheap consumer quality to entry level audiophile. So the best JBL speakers are quite good. Boat only offers cheap consumer level products. I don\u2019t think they offer any really good products. But if you compare JBL and Boat speakers of similar size and price, it could be that they are on par. I\u2019d still go for JBL as it is a brand I put more trust in. ",
