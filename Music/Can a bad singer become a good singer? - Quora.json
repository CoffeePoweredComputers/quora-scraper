            "answer_text": "I\u2019m working on a startup to help bad singers become good singers, because I know it\u2019s usually possible! First\u2026 music psychology research shows that only 1.5% of the population has amusia, which is brain-based \u201ctone deafness.\u201d Some others have beat deafness, or speech disorders, but otherwise the problem is lack of training. Second, I\u2019ve seen two methods so far that work. The Kodaly method, which I learned as a kid, can teach singing to every kid. At 150 Hungarian \u201csinging schools\u201d where it was taught from kindergarten on, everyone sang. And in Japan, Dr. Toru Yuba developed \u201cthe Yuba method\u201d based on his theories about \u201csinging muscles\u201d not being coordinated. I\u2019m in the process of adapting these and other insights with the help of some tech. Singing is a skill sometimes enhanced by talent, but it\u2019s a skill that improves with training. It requires you to focus on music in a different way, and use a whole bunch of muscles in a different way. But it gets better with training and practice! fwiw I was the entrepreneur of a cappella for 16 years, a tech VC for 11 years, and a startup mentor for 8 years. If you\u2019re interested in going from bad to good singer, let me know! ",

In fact, the transformation of a really bad singer in a decently good singer requires a lot of time, frequently years. Here I list a bunch of aspects of singing and what means \u201cget better\u201d in each one. Tuning: the skill of singing a specific note. Be tuned can be learned, it depends on your musical ear and how well you control your phonatory system.Range: how far can you go, how high and how low are the sounds you are able to produce. It\u2019s practice, but there\u2019s always a limitation in each singer; nobody can sing all the notes in music.Flexibility (or singing acrobatics, as I call it): the capability of making some stranges and complicated melismas.Sustain: how much time you can keep a single note, in an audible way.Volume-resonance (you can imagine yourself what this aspect is all about): the power of your voice, in terms of loudness and resonators. Your whole body resonates, but face and chest are especially good at this.Performing: how much soul you put in your singing.There\u2019s a lot of other things you can improve in singing, with months or years of practice, but the last one I listed is the harder: if you can\u2019t communicate emotions at the beginning of your training, if you can\u2019t be real\u2026man, in that case, the evolution has to be not just in the techniques, but also in you.

            "answer_text": "I think it really depends on the situation. If someone is genuinely tone deaf, it can be nigh impossible to train. It certainly wouldn't be a simple case of voice lessons. There would need to be a lot of ear training and even more patience and daily practice for the student. If being tone deaf isn't an issue, voice lessons and practice will help immensely. It's necessary that the student practice daily, bring a device or have an app to record the lesson and to record the practice sessions to be able to correct and improve technique. It is possible to become a better singer - I don't know about good simply because good is a pretty loose term - but it will take a lot of discipline and work on your side. ",

Do not trust videos on the Internet, half of the \u201cvocal coaches\u201d are fakes and try to be know-it-alls when in reality they don't know the first thing about singing. If your like me and don't have the money to pay for singing lessons, I'd look for a good paying job unless your too young then ask your parents to pay for you to have singing lessons for you birthday, therefore they'd have time to save up. For me, I got singing lessons for free at my school, they paid for it as I took music for a GCSE and can't afford singing lessons. Some schools will do that as well. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a copy pasta of my answer to the question \u201cCan I learn singing at the age of 18?\u201d I hope this helps. First of all, age is not concerned to singing at all. It depends on how much of efforts and dedication you put into singing. If you\u2019re starting to practice in recent time, I would suggest you to start exploring your voice first. Know your key, perfect pitch and singing style. Depending upon your voice i.e whether alto, tenor, soprano choose songs that are easy to sing. Easy to sing in the sense, no too high notes and no too low notes with basic vibratos. Practice singing the note sequence everyday and trying matching them exactly to the song. Use your sense of rhythm to learn. If you think you\u2019re out of rhythm, try using beats like snaps and claps. When you feel you\u2019re ready with the notes and rhythm, try singing a bit higher keys and complex vibratos. As this continues, practice daily and in no time you\u2019ll be good at it. Cheers! ",
