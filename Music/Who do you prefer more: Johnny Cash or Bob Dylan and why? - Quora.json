            "answer_text": "Bob Dylan or Johnny Cash? This isn\u2019t a test of who do you prefer, it\u2019s a test of where your head is at any given time. Both men admired one another tremendously and they worked well together. No one that has seen it is likely to forget hearing them share Dylan\u2019s \u201cGirl of the North Country\u201d on Cash\u2019s 1970 TV series. I\u2019d been listening to both men for many years at that time but Dylan was not someone that you saw on TV unless it was news footage of a march or protest. At the most of America hadn\u2019t ever heard of Bob Dylan and yet Johnny Cash had recorded several of his songs and brought him to a whole new audience on a top rated TV show. Cash did that for a number of young performers and older performers who were on the edge of obscurity. People who should have had a spotlight but just weren\u2019t getting it at the time like Pete Seeger, \u201cMother Maybelle\u201d Carter, Shel Silverstine, Bobby Bare, and so many more. What he did was remarkable considering the massive divide between Middle America and American Youth at the time. Bob Dylan has always been a poetic lyricist for his times, often controversial, demanding and insisting in his lyrics, strident vocally, acting as a klaxton to call attention to problems my generation faced from social issues, to politics, and even religion. Every generation needs a Bob Dylan to speak to them plainly, and move them to action. We all also need a Johnny Cash from the early rockabilly telling us life and music can be fun, to the Johnny of the live prison albums reminding us to care about our imprisoned brothers and sisters as well as our country even if we didn\u2019t always agree with it at the time. And just when we thought we\u2019d heard everything this old guy had to say, he teamed up with Rick Ruben for some of the most important and special albums that have ever been recorded. He reminded us of life and love, time and immortality and even mortality. You never have to make a choice, where ever your head\u2019s at at any given time these guys have a song for that in the most brilliant body of work of our time. Good times and bad, love, loss, and life, what ever is on your mind or heart, sit down and listen to what Cash and Dylan have to say. They\u2019ll get your ass straightened out in no time! ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has something they simply will never, ever understand and have given up on. Why do people think Sarah Palin is attractive? How can people actually like basketball? (too squeaky). Why is Steve Jobs a hero? Who eats fruitcake? I like Americans, and had a good time when I lived there. But why do so many adore Bob Dylan? I will just never get Dylan. Rasping, slurred, tuneless vocals; lyrics highly relevant to anyone happening to be in 1965; such-a-badass because he played an electric guitar at a folk festival; pretentious, overbearing, sanctimonious fans who enable and justify his rudeness and ego, because he\u2019s so authentic. And whenever I say this, 1) oh, you just don\u2019t understand him, 2) or you need to listen to album x. I\u2019ve got a doctorate in literature; I\u2019ve listened to his albums. Utter. Unlistenable. Crap. Every bit. Giving him a literature prize is a spit in the face of every author in 2016 who has, y\u2019know, written literature. And yet so many of my favorite musicians in history worship him. Whyyyyy? And please don\u2019t comment with some variation on 2). I\u2019ll take Leonard Cohen or Johnny Cash any day\u2014I confess to not being a huge Cash fan (he was a churchgoing family man and took pictures of himself with kittens or eating cake, so spare me the pompous man-in-black tormented darkness mystique baloney), but to me he had a listenable voice and interesting lyrics and music. His version of Hurt is a gorgeous song. ",
