            "answer_text": "first of all, BTS released Dynamite to give armys positive vibes during this pandemic *NOT TO* chart no. 1 on Hot100 It was armys, who made the goal of giving bts a no. 1 Hot100 and 100m views in 24hrs *NOT BTS OR BIGHIT* So please don't assume things or spread false information And now about \u201cBighit lowering the price and having different versions\u201d Are you a new army or a non-army ? Because you don't know that Bighit does that almost every BTS comeback SINCE 2013 so it's nothing new and they didn' lowered the price or released different versions to chart on Hot100 They have different versions for Make It Right, Mic Drop, Spring Day, I Need U and A LOT of other songs Same goes to the other western artists, which is FINE unlike ticket and merchandise bundling BTS DON\u2019T DO BUNDLING LOWERING THE PRICE OR HAVING DIFFERENT VERSIONS IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF CUZ THEY'RE STILL SELLING MUSIC AND NOT SELLING T-SHIRTS OR BLANKETS LIKE OTHER WESTERN OR KPOP ARTISTS Here's some examples of having different versions (which is fine) and having merch bundling (which I don't support)  )    ",

Fans were thirsty. I was shocked when I saw the price because I was going to buy it no matter what. So no it\u2019s not wrong. It is smart business. This is why I\u2019ve admired BH more than for their different approach to managing their talents. It\u2019s their business acumen and Marketing/PR team. ",
