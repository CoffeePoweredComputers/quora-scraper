            "answer_text": "Whenever something like this comes up, I feel the need to first note that some version like \u201cfocus group crap\u201d has always dominated music. Before recorded music, there was some guy at the music store, looking over sheet music and complaining about watered-down, middle-of-the-road, lowest-common-denominator crap that dominated the shelf space. I don\u2019t mean that as some funny,\u201cHaha! I bet that\u2019s true.\u201d thing. I mean that\u2019s exactly what was happening. And it was certainly going on in Record Stores between 1992 and 2000 when the Rage Against the Machine albums were being released. I can promise you that, because I was at those record stores. Hell, sometimes I led that very discussion that I am now decrying as forever foolish and futile. That said, specifically in regard to political engagement, I think David Stewart might have a point about the cumulative effect of decades of politically engaged songs and musicians seeming to have little to no effect on the public at large. I think you can find tons of mini Paul Ryan\u2019s out there who enthuse over their love of RATM while espousing beliefs that run entirely contrary to the things RATM was trying to communicate. Add to that the numbers of those musicians who seem to have \u201csold out\u201d, either by selling their politically engaged music for commercials, attaching a brand name to their tour logo or directly endorsing politicians and policies that represent significantly different or opposed values to the ones their fans felt were part of the original package and what they connected over. The types of fans who would be most likely to carry on those kinds of disappointments seem like exactly the sorts who would be most likely to have been inspired to carry on the message and what they were inspired by. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t politically engaged artists out there. It just means that they\u2019re less likely to lead with it as part of their package in the way that RATM did or that they haven\u2019t found the package that makes them so exciting that mainstream radio will let through despite their controversial message.

            "answer_text": "I think a lot of them are disillusioned with the whole idea of political music. They can point to artists like Rage Against The Machine and even go further back to the hippie protest singers of the sixties and ask what they really achieved? Lots of people made a lot of noise about peace and love in the sixties but did they really change anything? Were they changing hearts and minds or providing a soundtrack to the already converted? Did any governments fall or regimes change because of a few people with guitars? If left wing protest music had any impact then how did Trump get elected in 2016? You might think I\u2019m being cynical but I think a lot of people were turned off the idea of political protest music by George W Bush\u2019s second term. During GWB\u2019s first term there were a lot of annoyed people who voiced their concern in protest (all of which seems a bit quaint now to be honest). They railed against Bush and Cheney and raised their voices in protest and heartfelt song. And then Bush got elected again and a lot of people wondered what the point was. I\u2019m not sure I agree that the whole thing is futile but you can understand why modern singers wonder what the point of political protest music is when it\u2019s hard to find a precedent for it being a huge success.
