            "answer_text": "Slavery, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indian Removal, segregation, Vietnam War, Watergate. How can someone possibly argue that the United States was ever \u201cgreat\u201d?!  And then on top of that, the United States has the highest prison rates, suffers from de facto segregation, lags behind the developed world in education, and is trillions of dollars in debt! How can anyone argue that America is \u201cgreat\u201d?! What does it even mean to be \u201cgreat\u201d? Is a \u201cgreat\u201d nation one that has the most money, or happiest people, or longest lifespans, or biggest military, or smallest CO2 footprint? For me, the greatest nations are those that do the most amount of good for the greatest number of people. Therefore, let\u2019s turn our attention to humanity as a whole\u2026 Statistically, humanity has never been more free, happy, healthy, safe, and rich. Fact. This means whenever you hear the news reporting on North Korea, mass shootings, police protests, or ebola, one must put it into historical context.  This then raises the question, what one nation is most responsible for how great the world is today? And for that, my friends, the answer is unequivocally clear: The United States of America. Without the U.S., the world, with all its problems, would be drastically different and likely worse.  As humans, we have remarkably short-memories. If George W. Bush walked into a caf\u00e9, I\u2019m sure a lot of people would confuse him with Will Ferrell. And as much as we overlook the past, we drastically overestimate the durability of freedom and the present moment. Most humans, over the course of history were, in one form or another\u200a\u2014\u200aslaves. Freedom is an aberration. And society may very well return to this historical norm sooner than we think, if we don\u2019t pay proper respect to the values that got us here. And as terrible as we are at remembering the past, we are also terrible at predicting the future. The very week Donald Trump was elected \u2014 the most powerful man in the world \u2014 experts were giving him nearly a 0% chance of winning. By gaining a greater appreciation for the fragility of freedom and our fortune in this era, we should therefore gain a greater appreciation for the greatness of the United States of America. Why is it so important to value the U.S.? It\u2019s because the U.S. is fundamentally a collection of ideas and values. Ideas such as separation of powers, representative democracy, constitutionalism, federalism, human rights, and equality before the law (at least in theory). Ideas that we take for granted, because most of the world has adopted them, too, but ideas are only as useful as the number of humans willing to adopt them. There are a lot of young people in particular who wish to burn the U.S. flag and Constitution, because they see these things as symbols of racism and oppression. And in some ways, they\u2019re right. But they wouldn\u2019t just be burning the concepts and history they disagree with, but the concepts and history that have allowed them to burn the flag and the Constitution in the first place, without being crucified, impaled, hanged, or knelt down and shot in the back of the head.  \u201cHumans are plastic.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSeth Godin We are plastic in the sense that at a young age, we are very malleable, and then as we age, we harden into place. You and I have been shaped in such a way to value freedom and human rights. We believe so strongly in these things as to see them as non-debatable. But they are debatable! I can\u2019t stress this enough. Nazis were humans. Soviets were humans. MS-13 are humans. Must I recount the atrocities these humans have committed? Humans with normal functioning brains can be bred to be absolute angels or sheer devils.  This is the power and malleability of the human mind, and it\u2019s why culture matters. It\u2019s a human who may cuddle a child to sleep while reading a bedtime story for the 3rd time in a row, despite having to wake up early for work the following day. And it\u2019s a human who may shoot that child in the back of the head because the child questioned the validity of the bedtime story. The world has come incredibly close in living memory to being ruled by such demons. And the PRIMARY reason why our better angels prevailed is because of the United States of America. Hitler held out in WW2 for as long as he did, even when his generals said the war was lost, because he hoped German scientists would finally unlock the mystery of the atomic bomb. Just imagine a world where the Nazis got the nuke first! You\u2019re gay? Dead. You\u2019re Jewish? Dead. You're loud-mouthed? Dead. You're non-German? Dead or enslaved. If the U.S. didn\u2019t enter WW2 and specifically focus on Nazi Germany, despite Japan being the one that attacked us at Pearl Harbor, then most historians agree Germany would\u2019ve likely gotten the nuke (the U.S. got it in 1945, and the U.S.S.R. got it in 1949) because Nazi Germany\u2019s military technology was far more advanced than that of the Soviet Union, and even the United States, at the time. The U.S. was like Superman, flying in at the last moment to save the falling girl from the burning building.  John F. Kennedy once said, \u201cPower reveals.\u201d After WW2, when the world was in rubble, what did the United States do? The U.S. could have easily conquered the globe. No one would have had the capability to halt the U.S. military-industrial complex with its doomsday weapon. But instead of enslaving the world, as every previous empire sought to do, the United States lent and gave money to numerous nations so that they could rebuild, and not fall to the tyranny of communism. Eventually, communism was defeated, too, and with the rise of democracy and capitalism, the world has never seen such a high standard of living!  But the world isn\u2019t as great as it is just because the U.S. helped stop the bad guys, but also because the U.S. creates great things. Many things you enjoy in your life, no matter where you live, was invented by an American or an American immigrant.  In the end, I\u2019m not looking for a red carpet to be rolled out to me simply because I\u2019m an American. The United States, much like humans, is self-interested and often short-sighted, but may we occasionally take a break from pointing out her flaws to celebrate her blessings. May we put her past into context by not just focusing on what she hasn\u2019t done for a particular ethnicity, or even for you as an individual, but on what she has done for humanity as a whole. And may we see that regardless of where we are from, we all have a little America in us.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think USA is the greatest country of all time. I think we spend a lot on military, and we have high incarceration rates, higher gun violence, and we now have the highest covid deaths. But I don't think America is this \u201cRacist\u201d country or I don't think America is a terrible country.  People who think America is the worst country or is a bad country is frankly stupid. I once told this lady that if she doesn't like how USA is going, why cant she move after we get the coronavirus. The Lady called me a SEXIST and blocked me. Yeah, this woman called me a sexist because I asked a question. Weird right? Don't get me wrong, other states are better than America at some parts. Norway and Sweden have better education as well as lower poverty rates.  But United States isn't a bad country. The people who say America is racist has obviously NEVER been to any other country and lived there. The United States of America were the first ones who actually created a democracy that actually worked. The Founding Fathers pioneered the principle where the people don't answer to the monarch. Why do you think the French Revolution happened? The French people were inspired by the Americans.  In America, you have the right of free speech. In most countries, you can\u2019t even speak your mind. If you said something that wasn\u2019t what the government liked, you would be either killed or kidnapped and never to be seen again. Not only that, but America has made MANY achievements that make me proud. America created the concept of electricity, atomic bombs, airplane, internet, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Social Media, Smart phones, and more. In most parts of America, You can go anywhere - almost, at anytime of day and night without fear of getting mugged or killed. You can talk to any policeman/woman without fear of reprisals, even if asking directions. You don't dodge on taxes or have to take/give bribes to survive. I do admit America has some racism in it, but its not as bad as people say it is. Black people complain how America had slavery, even though every single country had a form of slavery or oppression. News Flash, Jews were slaves the longest and experienced the Holocaust, yet they never complained to Germany. Not to mention, but the Romans used slaves to build colossieums, and the Egyptians used slaves to build pyramids. Why is America racist because they used slaves, but other countries aren\u2019t?  Yeah we made some mistakes, like Agent Orange and racial segregation. But we learned from our mistakes. We ended segregation and now black people can go to schools that are predominantly white. Women now have the right to vote and are looked equally. If America was so racist, then why is it that most Africans want to travel to USA instead of other countries. Why do most people want to go to America if America is \u201cracist\u201d  USA has made many mistakes, but what makes America great is instead of whining and complaining, Americans learn from their mistakes, and try to achieve greatness. Also, America created superheroes and the majority of sports which is awesome.     America isn\u2019t the Greatest Country of all time. But it IS a great country, and as an American citizen I\u2019m proud to be an American. For Americans who hate America, seriously. If you hate America, then why don't you just leave after the coronavirus vaccine is released? ",
