            "answer_text": "Yes, they do. Don\u2019t get me wrong. There\u2019s perfectly nothing wrong with using autotune. Many other K-pop groups (maybe even all) and western artists have used autotune in their songs before. You can hear the autotune in songs like UGH!, Dionysis, and some others. The thing is: It doesn\u2019t seem like they use it when they perform live. I might be wrong on this one, but everyone knows how clear and exact BTS\u2019s voices sound when they sing live. It sounds almost (if not exactly) like in the studio versions. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with using autotune and the fact that they sound exactly the same and even better when singing it live, is one of the things that makes BTS special. It\u2019s their choice whether they want to use autotune or not, and we shouldn\u2019t worry about it since they sound like angels either way :) . . . . Edit: Here\u2019s an example. Jungkook is singing Airplane Pt. 2 acapella and sounds absolutely wonderful and just like the studio version!  Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what songs you are talking about, because yes in some of their songs they do use auto tune or other effects on their voices, but that is only because that\u2019s the kind of style they think fits the song, a good example here could be Dionysus. So yeah they do in some songs, but not in all of their songs at all. And when they sing live they do not use auto tune at all, they definitely don\u2019t need it\ud83d\ude01 This video I once stumbled over will explain what I mean:  All in all, I agree with the first answer, just wanted to say that the reasoning of their use of auto tune in some songs is only because they want the song to sound a little robotic or something like that. So in the songs where they use it, its very clear that they have effects on their voices. If you don\u2019t know what I mean then listen to their song Dionysus\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "They have used auto tune in certain songs, yes. But not for the typical reason. Auto tune is usually thought to be used to \u201cimprove voices that aren\u2019t strong\u201d. Or at least that\u2019s how many view it. However, each members voice is beautiful and doesn\u2019t need such a tool. In some songs that auto tune was used, for example Black Swan, It is used to blend their voices to be less distinguishable. To convey their message as one. All feeling the same things. It was used intentionally and fit the song perfectly. It was used as a way to express their art. ",
