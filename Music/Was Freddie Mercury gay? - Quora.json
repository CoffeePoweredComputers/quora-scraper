            "answer_text": "Yes, Freddie was gay. Some people conclude that he\u2019s bisexual because Barbara Valentin claims she was in a relationship with Freddie. This is false. Barbara never had a romantic relationship with Freddie. Even her children have confirmed this: BILD: Did your mother and Freddie Mercury have a love affair? Minki Reichardt: \u201cThe two were very intimate with each other, often slept in a bed, but they had no sexual relationship. Freddie liked men and was with Winnie Kirchberger, the host of the 'Sebastianseck' restaurant.\u201d The timeline doesn\u2019t even match up. Freddie was in a relationship with Winnie. Other close sources like Freddie\u2019s PA debunked this as well.  Freddie lived in a time where being anything but straight was bad. His religion deemed being gay as devil worship. With this being said, I think Freddie was in denial for a long time. He dated Rosemary Pearson, and during the entire relationship she expressed how he was constantly craving sex with a man. Freddie at the time claimed he was bisexual, but was not satisfied and as Rosemary put it had \u201csexual difficulties.\u201d Josephine Marston, a college friend, talked about a love affair Freddie had during his college years. I\u2019m not sure if this was Rosemary or not, but in the documentary \u201cKiller Queen\u201d Josephine reveals that this girlfriend reported Freddie \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it up.\u201d He was very emotional during this time and would often break down crying because of all his inner turmoil. Rosemary even revealed that Freddie thought \u201chomosexuality was a walking sex crime as a result from his parsee upbringing.\u201d Freddie wanted to be bisexual because it would have been easier. Hence, why after Rosemary he had a relationship with another woman, Mary Austin. The difference with Mary and Freddie\u2019s relationship is that she showed him unconditional love that he had never had. Freddie had a rough childhood that lacked love. I think Mary was a Strong maternal figure that he was lacking all his life. There\u2019s no doubt that he loved her, but it wasn\u2019t in a romantic sense. People claim that Mary was the \u201clove of his life\u201d which in some respects she was. He absolutely adored her, but he was not romantically in love with her. Freddie had many male affairs during the relationship and eventually told Mary that yet again, he was \u201cbisexual\u201d and thought they should part. The thing is, if you are bisexual you like BOTH men and women. A common misconception is that bisexual people cannot have monogamous relationships because they like both genders. Therefore, if they are in a relationship with a woman they will want to cheat with a man. This is not true. A bisexual person is satisfied with both genders therefore, they do not have the urge to cheat. Freddie had many gay affairs at this point. He knew what it was like to have sexual relations with the same sex and was actually in a separate relationship with a man, David Minns. If he was bisexual it would have worked out with Mary. He was not satisfied. Mary, the women he spent seven year\u2019s of her life with and knew everything about him, said \u201cFreddie I don\u2019t think you are bisexual. I think you are gay.\u201d The media likes to play up that Mary was the \u201clove of Freddie\u2019s life.\u201d Even more so that the movie has come out. If Freddie wanted to be with Mary he could have been. If he was a bisexual man and Mary was the \u201clove of his life\u201d why wasn\u2019t he with her? Mary definitely would have complied. Every one assumes Love Of My Life Is about Mary but Freddie never confirmed that this song was about her. In fact, John Reid confirmed that Freddie confided that it was secretly about David Minns. Freddie was the one who called off the relationship with Mary so why would he want her to \u201churry back\u201d etc\u2026 Mary was super important to Freddie\u2019s life. She was always there for him no matter what. Mary also loved Freddie and I think she never fully got over him. Freddie and many close friends of Freddie have confirmed he was gay, yet people don\u2019t want to acknowledge it. They rather read Leslie Ann Jones book (which is full of lies) and watch the Bohemian Rhapsody film (Which is mainly fictional) and form their opinions on that. Those who claim Freddie was bisexual either don\u2019t know him that well or want it to be true because they want to push the narrative that he was in love with Mary all his life. He was a gay man.

            "answer_text": "I know this is an old question, but honestly, it drives me mad that anyone should need to ask and even more that so few people have the guts to answer YES. Freddie Mercury was gay. No, his sexuality shouldn't make a difference in this day and age, and yes, his music is more important to his legacy, but his sexuality was a major part of who he was. Coming out \u2014 in his private life \u2014 was obviously a struggle for Freddie, and for people to undermine that fight for personal acceptance by pinning their own labels on him is not helpful. And there are so many inaccuracies about his love affairs. Freddie had two girlfriends in his life, art student Rosemary Pearson at college and Mary Austin. After he came out when he was with Mary, he never slept with another woman. Barbara Valentin was a good friend in Munich, but he was actually in a relationship with a man named Winnie Kirchberger at the time \u2014 Barbara was basically their translator, because Winnie couldn\u2019t speak English and Freddie couldn\u2019t speak German, and Freddie\u2019s beard. Freddie and Barbara bought a flat together but he never moved in, whereas he did stay with Winnie. And the claim that Freddie slept with \u2018many other women\u2019 is also baseless, stemming from a terrible article in The Daily Star after Freddie\u2019s death, which claimed he had various female lovers \u2014 but this was from the worst of the \u2018red top\u2019 tabloid newspapers which hounded Freddie in the months leading up to his death. All false. When even the vaunted Mary Austin describes Freddie as gay (or \u2018a gay\u2019, to use her exact phrase), I think we should all be able to accept that yes, that\u2019s part of who he was, and respect his life choices, including his \u2018marriage\u2019 to Jim Hutton. Edited to add this quote from a German magazine, Popcorn, who interviewed Freddie in 1984 (before he met Jim Hutton):  ",
