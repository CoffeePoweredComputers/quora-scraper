            "answer_text": "To me, not necessarily. Granted my exposure to nu metal was very short, but they did nothing for me. I did find it cheap that they had their huge moment with \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d, rode that out for at least four years and released nothing but a fucking remix of that same album and nothing new, so calling them a \u201cone hit wonder\u201d isn't 100% incorrect. The likes of KoRn, Slipknot, and even freaking Limp Bizkit had more of a lasting impact in the end. Much like Disturbed, they had their moment and faded away. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say so. They made a big impact on me, and lots of other people. Their lyrics really spoke to so many different people in so many different ways. They also had a special sound. They mixed rapping and screaming, which was done before, but was still pretty uncommon. While they may have not been super metal, they were definitely a gateway band. Kids would listen to LP and then end up to some underground thrash metal band that not many people have heard of later in life. ",
