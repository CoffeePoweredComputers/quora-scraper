            "answer_text": "I was facing the same problem with my turntable (JVC) and all it needed was a little bit of cleaning and lubrication. The main problem areas when it comes to speed issues are: The speed control knobs.The speed selector (33.5/45/78 selector).All you need to do it open up the bottom board, locate these areas and use a cleaning fluid (I used deoxIT 45) and rotate the knobs or flick the selector. I came across this video on YouTube that might be helpful. Note that the video is for a Technics SL-1300, but it does demonstrate the basic idea very well. You would need to find similar components on your turntable.  I can help a little more if I know the type of turntable you have. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It's highly likely the turntable is idler wheel driven by a motor and mechanically quite simple.  The platter will lift off somehow which will partially expose the drive mechanics; the remainder of the mechanics can be accessed from underneath.  Once you're able to get a full view of the innards, the problem should be quite obvious and usually attributed to misalignment or binding due to age and dried lubricant which a little TLC and oiling will usually fix.
