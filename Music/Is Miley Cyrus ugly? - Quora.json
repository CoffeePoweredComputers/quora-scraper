Of course, I\u2019m one of those types of people whose perception of beauty is wholly dependent on emotional attachments to women\u2019s personalities. Let\u2019s see, what do I know Miley Cyrus from? First, there was that Hannah Montana show. I was never totally drawn towards her character. All I knew was that she was just a celebrity keeping a low profile by living a double life. I wasn\u2019t attracted to her the same way I was attracted to characters on other shows like Keely Teslow from Phil of the Future or Maddie Fitzpatrick from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. I like her music, but it still doesn\u2019t help me think of her as anything more than neutral in appearance. Of course, I like her old music and none of the newer stuff (which isn\u2019t quite my style). So that gives me even less reason to think of her as exceptionally beautiful. ",
