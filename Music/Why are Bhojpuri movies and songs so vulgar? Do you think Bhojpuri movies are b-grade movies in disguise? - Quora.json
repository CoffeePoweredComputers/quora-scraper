            "answer_text": "I want to open my heart on this. Being from eastern UP heartland, I think my answer if wrong according to you, must be answered with suitable comments only. We had a golden history of both Lord Rama and Goddess Sita belonging to this region, even Lord Krishna is not so far from here. So we (I think all of us) have more special respect for this language as most of us are brought up in an environment where women cover their hair and face from elders as a mark of respect and somewhere deep within, we all love and respect this legacy and try to do or want to be treated the same way howsoever open society we live in. But there is another side to it. Like all animals, man too need to quench his hunger (akalmand ko ishaara kaafi). And one can not hide it for long behind your rich legacy/dress (dhoti-kurta or saree, I am respectful at the same time) The Character of those golden times has seen deterioration to what people are having right now but we all follow that legacy out of respect or to put up a good face of our heritage, a natural momentum! This leaves a lot of empty space within and vulgarity has successfully made most out of this situation although its with our consent only because we openly can not accept it or allow any women from our family to do but at the same time, we will love to watch and do all that. If you disagree, mention why! What to say of the World, in other parts of India only, we are watching people/women which are relatively open to dressing sense and expression but we do not want ours to follow them out of our respect for our heritage but being a living being before a human being, we love watching or fantacizing all what people in the west are doing. Isn't it. For e.g., one can find fully adult videos of Sunny Leone, but once she donned salwar suit and folded hands in front of public, we forgot all of her past because of our 'that image' of old India and now little girls in our family are dancing to her songs while now no one so called 'moral people' are questioning how she had been to this stage. I think one must agree that we, or Indian men are no different from Westerners just that they are open/truthful about their desires but we are hiding ours although we are doing all but hide our faces behind the 'rich legacy'. It's better according to my personal opinion that be open like Westerners but at the same time be open to debate on our 'old legacy' and adopt/leave according to what's good for society but at least first be truthful to your desires in public domain, not like that according to real statistics we are consuming tons for porn but at the same time, feel no shame in carrying the 'moral' tag which in India, relatively the people of UP east only enjoy. Are the west people not producing any good quality of work when according to 'our standards', they are morally corrupt when they are so open on sexuality. Their culture is not something to profess about but it's better to logically conclude that our culture is the best after experiencing/'analyzing' all other system followed elsewhere, instead of just having learned by rote that we are the best and behind this do all the fantacies.  (Respectable female viewers, correct/teach me if wrong, male viewers also give your thoughts) Coming back to the subject,\u2026\u2026 Only devi-geet and bhajan sounds good in Bhojpuri. And it sounds best in Bhojpuri only as the language is very intimate. The special thing about this language is that dirty (cheap talk like hurling abuses or sexually provocative language) sounds very dirty/'third grade' unlike in English where the same is shown as a style statement. And it's very good which keeps the people away from not being good. Let's try to earn Bhojpuri it's due respect by not watching or doing any mouth publicity of these days' third grade Bhojpuri movies. Please agree/disagree with suitable comments. ",

            "answer_text": "I belongs to Gaya , Bihar so I can try to answer this in more simpler way See if you are saying Bhojpuri movies and songs are vulgar then you are right and wrong both. Why is to so ? It has two aspect - one is related to time and other is age Time - it is related to time in terms of old and new Bhojpuri song . There was a time when everyone loves to watch Bhojpuri song and movies . You hardly notice any vulgarity in that if you see old Bhojpuri movies and song . Remember the film Nadiya ke paar ?? What a awesome movies it was which picturises beautifully the desi indian village and it's profound culture and it's song if you hear today you will be lost in your village . Is this movie have any vulgarity , slangs etc no way Singers like Malini Awasthi ,Sharda Sinha , Manoj Tiwari really known for giving evergreen hits. There songs if you hear you will notice it has desi culture embibe in it beautifully . Nowadays teenager singer Maithili Thakur is doing great work with her sweet melodious voice that mostly covers the lokgeet ( traditional folk) , many Maithili songs which you will be fan of . Also actor like Amitabh Bachchan worked in Bhojpuri movies But you will be right if you compare with today's Bhojpuri movies . they are worthless , incompetent and fill with dance( not even good as several dance show) and cheap songs that mostly contain the sexually provactive language slangs with double meaning and this is because many people have developed a mindset of that kind ( not right to say but it's true) and also the song is being made by local singers that hardly even know the alphabets of the song except to sing with full untoned voice . As far as grade is concern you may wrong if you say to movies ( as bollywood and Hollywood have much more than that) but for the songs of nowdays of Bhojpuri you can say it it's not going to wrong they are polluting the young minds and filling the environment with lots of inferiority and akwardness . So my opinion is that although there are vulgarity nowdays in Bhojpuri movies and song no doubt but not forget that it has several old movies which are the true representation of Bhojpuri and still there are directors who are trying to come up with good content with burning social issues and messages but facing the box-office ",
