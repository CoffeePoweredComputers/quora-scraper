            "answer_text": "Edit 1: This was written around a bit over year before the YG scandals and him stepping down, etc etc. I\u2019ve come to realise that the real culprit here is YG, not the girls. But still, have a read of this controversial opinion I stood by a year ago. :)) Okay, I really don\u2019t want to start any fights or fanwars. Just clearing that up before I start to give my opinion. But if this offends you to the point where you want to leave a rude or hateful comment, please leave now. I was a BLINK for about a year before I actually started to open my eyes to recent K-pop news, headlines, et cetera. But after I found out more about BLACKPINK from K-pop news sites, certain YouTubers and research, I decided that the dislikeable elements outweighed the likeable ones. Here\u2019s my list. I dislike some of their music, just in general.First up, BLACKPINK only has a total nine songs, which YG keep reusing in \u2018new albums\u2019. And secondly, some of their songs just aren\u2019t to my liking. \u2018Whistle\u2019, their debut, got a little bit annoying after a few listens, and I didn\u2019t like \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019 because it literally just repeats the title, and the lyrics weren\u2019t appealing. The only song I continue to like from BLACKPINK is \u2018As if it\u2019s Your Last\u2019. I used to like \u2018BOOMBAYAH\u2019 quite a lot, and I still think it has a pretty good rhythm and upbeat vibe, but after excessive replaying, it came off as \u2018gaudy\u2019 and over-done. \u2018DDU-DU-DDU-DU\u2019 was okay, but it really didn\u2019t deserve the hype that it got. BUT! The tea I have to spill about it is that it is another washed up Korean onomatopoeia-titled song from YG with the title in the chorus, and EDM instrumental after it. Think about iKON\u2019s \u2018BLING BLING\u2019 (the chorus goes \u2018BLING BLING\u2026*EDM instrumental*\u2019), and BIGBANG\u2019s iconic \u2018BANG BANG BANG\u2019 (if you haven\u2019t heard it, the chorus is literally the exact same as BLING BLING.) Both their choruses have obviously similar construction, and now DDU-DU-DDU-DU is part of the sin list. Vocals and Rapping, live.I remember having a chat about Ros\u00e9\u2019s vocals to my classmates from the school I graduated from. I said she was nasally live and her warm timbre was forced by YG, and I was targeted. However, though this opinion is very unpopular too, I still stand by my belief. Okay, I know singing live is hard, and that I should be targeting even worse live groups like TWICE (I\u2019m a ONCE), but TWICE is a different issue, and I love TWICE because of reasons other than their vocals. Back to BLACKPINK. Ros\u00e9 is a talented vocalist with amazing potential (my music teacher who is a vocalist and a pianist said this, so this is judged from a professional P.O.V.), but her singing sounds like it is forced in studio versions. Her warm, unique soprano tone colour has become very popular with the media, therefore making YG force her into keeping it like that for all their songs. However, her predebut/early debut voice is amazing. Her weakness, however, is singing live. In fact, all of the members cannot sing or rap stably live. (This MR Removed is actually one of BLACKPINK\u2019s worst, to be fair, but their best is still no match for vocal powerhouse groups like Red Velvet.)  The most in tune and least nasally and least excessively breathy here is Jisoo. Even though her tone colour doesn\u2019t show up as well as Ros\u00e9\u2019s in studio versions, it\u2019s still better onstage. Her tone colour and vibe is more mature and womanly, which doesn\u2019t appeal to fans as much but is less faked than Ros\u00e9\u2019s tone colour. Jennie actually cannot sing live. I would actually barely call her live performances acceptable, because she is legitimately shouting and misses out several parts in her performance as you can see in the video. Her rapping is more shouting to try and keep her voice afloat during the whole performance, which she fails to do. #LazyJennie and other members\u2019 personality sinsOkay, please. Jennie. Where do I even start with her? She has unacceptable stage presence, and if you don\u2019t believe me, WATCH THIS.  I don\u2019t think I have to say anything else about Jennie being lazy onstage after that video apart from the fact that YG, absolutely petrified of having his company\u2019s and his reputation being stained, removed a viral video called #LazyJennie. Jennie\u2019s personality also absolutely IRRITATES me to the point of no return. She\u2019s rude, pretentious, and thinks she\u2019s so superior to her fans, interviewers, talk show hosts, and even sometimes her members themselves. Some BLINKs call it \u2018being savage\u2019, but NO! It\u2019s plain rudeness. There is a solid line between being savage and being rude. \"Do you even know any cities in New Zealand?\" #BLACKPINK #JENNIE shutting down Kim Yeong-cheol \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 #knowingbrothers #askusanything pic.twitter.com/AKfXu5hxox\u2014 Kpop Hawaii \ud83c\udf08 (@KpopHawaii) October 3, 2017\n You see, this fan seems to think it\u2019s okay. Firstly, she wasn\u2019t even shutting him down, because he wasn\u2019t being rude. But let me give a solid example. Suga from BTS is considered a \u2018bad boi\u2019 by some ARMYs, yet I cannot think of one example from the top of my head where he was insolent. Sometimes Jennie acts all \u2018aegyo\u2019 and cute, for her image in the media, which utterly disgusts me. The other members\u2019 personalities and reputations in the media are acceptable, but in my opinion, there is nothing about Lisa\u2019s personality that attracts me. (This is a pretty unpopular opinion.) Ros\u00e9 is so-so, but her giggling sometimes triggers me. Jisoo is the only one I am completely comfortable with, as she is mature, polite and dignified, and not too worried about her \u2018image\u2019, therefore making it better. And apparently, she was a school bully. Evidence was provided by a Twitter user who went to the same high school as her. The evidence was rock solid, including her school photo. And if you search it up, you might as well just get a bunch of overprotective BLINKs saying that haters should die, which segues nicely into the next point. Toxic BLINKs being overly defensive of BLACKPINKBefore you start rebutting me and saying that ARMYs are more toxic, hear me out. ARMYs are a very, very large and diverse fanbase with a vast majority of peaceful, reasonable and mature fans who respect each other and BTS, but the light on the media is being shone upon the ARMYs who behave disgustingly like sasaengs and over-enthusiatic Koreaboos. But BLINKs are a whole different matter. When one of my BLINK peers (who is a Korean boy) casually brought up BLACKPINK and K-pop in general a conversation topic, I politely said, \u2018Oh, I like BTS and TWICE! BLACKPINK though, I\u2019m not a BLINK.\u2019 But this polite, innocent sentence was not good enough for him. He started saying things like \u2018F**k ARMYs, they\u2019re all crazy Koreaboo girls, and BTS are so ugly and they can\u2019t sing,\u2019 and \u2018Why the hell do you like TWICE? They\u2019re so untalented and fake and their comebacks suck.\u2019 I said \u2018Okay, have your opinion and I\u2019ll have mine\u2019. But that was still not enough, he started pushing how great BLACKPINK was in my disgusted face and adding some obscene and explicit information about him and them. Oh yeah, and I left. Just walked right out the door. I know that my peer was just one example of a BLINK, but I have seen similar insolent behaviour and shocking comments all over BLACKPINK\u2019s, Red Velvet\u2019s, BTS\u2019s and TWICE\u2019s YouTube channels and some of their Amino groups being polluted by rude BLINKs. I do not like this. Their repetitive and overused conceptsOkay, it seems ironic that I just scolded a peer for criticising TWICE\u2019s concepts. BLACKPINK are supposed to be a girl-crush concept, but having Teddy as their producer just shows the same catchy, bling-bling, black-and-pink themed vibe in pretty much all their MVs. Their comebacks (which are pretty rare\u2026) are never fresh and in a different setting, and all of them show the same kind of black and pink themed, studio-shot choreography with the four of them being badass. There isn\u2019t anything bad about that, but it isn\u2019t to my liking.    Compared to other contemporary girl groups, I think their concepts are wearing out. GFRIEND is known for an innocent but impactful concept, which is a fresh blend of two contrasting things. They also want to do a dark/girl-crush concept next, which shows their diversity in concept. Red Velvet are the absolute queens of concept, even pioneering their own concepts like \u2018femme fatale\u2019 and \u2018hauntingly sweet\u2019, dark, quirky, doll-like, dream, vampire, cheerleader (in their debut song) and mischievous, and their ability to take on any concept makes them unique.     TWICE is best known for girly and cutesy concepts that are put into different themes, like halloween for TT, party/summer for Dance the Night Away, a movie cameo theme for What is Love? and a studio maze for Heart Shaker. They have variety in their concepts too, though they fit an overarching girly theme.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, blinks are touchy, so they won\u2019t be liking this answer. Blackpink is a nice gg. Their songs are ok, it seems that most of their stuff is ok. First, we talk about their music. Their music is nice, Ddu DDU gets stuck in my head cause its catchy, but then it kinda just\u2026 [JENNIE]I may look sweet, but I don't act like itMy slender figure hides twice the volumeI give it to them straightDon't care what people thinkBlack to the Pink we're pretty and savage [LISA]When you want itI take whenever I wantWhatever you do doesn't faze meMy hands are full of fat checksIf you're curious, go ahead and fact-checkMy standards are up topI'm in my elementA little dangerous, I'm ToxicYou fall for me, I'm Foxy [ROS\u00c9]Think twiceI don't pretend to play nice like othersDon't flatter yourselfI smile easily because it does me good [JISOO]You do not know yetBut if you want, go ahead and test meYou're too predictableIf you wanted something easy [JENNIE]Oh wait til 'I do what I doAh yeah Ah yeahHit you with that DDU-DU-DDU-DU DUAh yeah Ah yeahHit you with that DDU-DU-DDU-DU DU [JENNIE]The street I'm walkingBLACK PINK 4-way IntersectionNorth, South, East, and West, in all directions we run itI bought your entire bucket listI pull you in, then push you awayI do as I please because I'm a bad girlLove it or Hate it, whatever they sayWhen the base drop it's another banger [JISOO]Think twiceI don't pretend to play nice like othersDon't flatter yourselfI smile easily because it does me good [ROS\u00c9]You do not know yetBut if you want, go ahead and test meYou're too predictableIf you wanted something easy [JENNIE]Oh wait til 'I do what I do [LISA]Hit you with that DDU-DU-DDU-DU DUAh yeah Ah yeahHit you with that DDU-DU-DDU-DU DUAh yeah Ah yeah [ROS\u00c9]What you gonna do when I come come through with that that uh uh huhWhat you gonna do when I come come through with that that uh uh huh [LISA]Hot, hot, hot, like fireHot, hot, hot, like fire [JISOO]Hot, hot, hot, like fire [ROS\u00c9]Hot, hot, hot, like fire [JENNIE]Hit you with that DDU-DU-DDU-DU DU nice, it's complimenting themselves. it has a nice beat and tone but this song makes them seem arrogant. to me, it gives off this tone: \u201cOh, I'm from YG, the top of the big three. because I'm a bad batch and I think I'm epic come and be my slave\u201dYea\u2026 You get the idea. But it\u2019s a good song nonetheless.Then comes Jennies Solo. It\u2019s also catchy and it gets stuck in my head. I'm not going to paste the lyrics but the idea is \u2018breaking from a toxic relationship.\u2019 That\u2019s a theme I like more. As a rapper, her singing is very good, and her English rap part is better because you couldn\u2019t really hear an accent. Overall, Jennie has talent. These are the 2 songs I approve of.Here are the other few songs I have heard and reasons. (Remember these are my own thoughts and opinions. Before you start to get ready to argue, remember no one is perfect, not even your idols. there will always be different opinions on idols and stuff) If it's your last: It\u2019s ok, very boring tune and it isn\u2019t as catchy. I forgot about this song in about an hour, I also don\u2019t like this song because this is the song that got my friend into BP, she would put this on replay for hours at a time. I got sick of this song. Playing with fire: This was the second MV I saw of BP, I instantly connected As if it's your last with this one. I thought that they ran out of concepts. Playing with fire is not as great. I watched the mv to write this and I forgot the song already. It really isn\u2019t that great. Boombayah: Good song, I love the vibe and it's currently stuck in my head. I like the vibe, but still the same theme as ddu ddu. The \u201cI'm a player, and you are lucky to have me like you\u201d vibe. The lyrics are trash though. \u201cMiddle finger up, F U pay me, 90\u2019s baby I pump up the jam.\u201d What the absolute heck. That's in Lisa\u2019s rap part. It makes absolutely no sense. I thought this song was talking about wanting to dance with a boy but because they are popular other people want to dance with them too. What???? Whistle: It kinda shows the pink side of BlackPink, but still more of the bad girl tone. Ok song, I like the chorus but not catchy. No part of this song is catchy, like Playing With Fire. Also, Lisa doesn\u2019t look as good in that hair color. I saw these 5 MV\u2019s and they all look so similar. Out of these, I didn\u2019t really like any of the MV\u2019s in particular. Some parts were cringey but the music was fine. Let's move on. Members: Jisoo: She\u2019s kinda pretty, her lips are a bit too angular, one of her eyes seems a little big longer*not bigger*. She struck me as one of these quiet kids but is very funny and awesome to be around after you know her. She\u2019s nice. Rose: Wow. She is pretty, THat very true, but her lips look a little fake*or its the angle* SHe looks like the popular but nice kids Lisa: Lisa, Lisa Lisa. What should I say? Ok, I\u2019ll say it straight on.She\u2019s ugly in my standards.Sorry Blinks, but in my standards, her nose seems to be in an awkward shape. Her eyes look fake and overall I don\u2019t like her appearance. *No Offense Lisa, You are obviously prettier than me but it\u2019s just my brain* Jennie: Where do I start with this brat? First of all.Attitude.Her appearanceHer position.Just about everything.Her attitude. Yes, I\u2019ve seen the lazy Jennie videos. I have no idea what\u2019s going on with her, It might be that she became famous at an early age, or something is happening in her life. But she should do something about her lazy dancing and stuff. If you look at BTS SUGA, he went through depression. He has social anxiety and stuff like that, but he was never lazy. As a producer of songs and someone who didn\u2019t sleep much, he would often be seen sleeping, at then which he was called lazy. But although we don\u2019t know what's happening, we can't accept this. Idols are basically models of perfection. People should know, that's what idols are. Her Attitude pt.2: THen comes the princess treatment. OH PSH> YG TREATS HER LIKE A LITERAL PRINCESS. Her solo, then blocking the lazy Jennie videos. NO. That\u2019s basically rewarding a child's bad behavior. YG put CL in the trash and gave Jennie (Who isn\u2019t even on the same level of CL in terms of Rapping, singing and etc.) a solo.No. Her appearance: She reminds me of a pig. NO OFFENSE. Her facial structure reminds me of a pig. That's it.Her position as Main Rapper, Vocalist: WELL\u2026. It seems that Jennie doesn\u2019t rap as much. Well, why put her as the main rapper then? COME ON YG. Jennie is mostly why I don\u2019t like black pink. I think that they're just too hyped up. BLINKS: This is mostly the real reason. Blinks are so touchy. So sensitive. I had two friends, I introduced them to BTS. THen the boy abandoned BTS and went into BP. Then he started shaming BTS saying things like \u201cHow could I have liked them in the first place? their music is awful and soft\u201d I didn\u2019t bother fighting and I just ignored him and avoided him. The second one, who is a girl, also likes BP. What can I say, I was kinda stupid and I wrote up a list of reasons I don\u2019t like BP and stuff like that. I mean, It\u2019s basically this entire answer but in point form. I made sure to make it sound like it isn\u2019t the girls' fault or anything, but my own head that's making me \u2018miss real talent\u2019. I showed my two \u2018ex-best friends\u2019 the list and the boy grabbed it, put it in our classroom shredder and made a huge deal out of it. Read \u2018told everyone I was a stupid bich that was jealous of Idols and made a list to drag them down and wanted them to forget about them too.\u2019 I gave up on them. They accused me of being an Anti who was going to hire a hitman from the dark web and shoot them all down. They cut me off every time I wanted to explain myself. No. Just no. That wasn't hated that I just wrote, that was the real life of stuff in my head. Fandoms are so touchy, Anything would be hate. And criticism is means insulting them in the K-pop world. No, Criticism is not insulted. Here are the official definitions: the analysis and judgment of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work or the expression of disapproval of someone or something based on perceived faults or mistakes. Yes, even your idol makes mistakes, so if I say that their singing or rapping could improve, I\u2019m basically telling them that their singing or rapping is so awful that even mines could be better. I am just so tired of this. Having to deal with people freaking out and shaming me every time I talk about another artist and I\u2019m not praising them. I am still a fan of many groups, but I stopped interacting with the other fans and fandoms. ",
