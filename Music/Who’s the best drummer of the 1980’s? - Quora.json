            "answer_text": "Steve Gadd? His versatility comes to mind. Elvin and Tony Wililams, Billy Higgins, Blakey, and Mike Clarke and Harvey Mason and Steve Jordan and Lenny White were among the greatest. But I will go with Gadd, by a nose! Just a few comments\u2026 If you wanted cutting edge of jazz, i would not go with the great Steve Gadd, but instead with Billy Higgins, Blakey, Elvin, Williams. But Gadd would be far better in a jazz setting than Elvin would be in a modern drum situation like Mahavishnu, or Stuff, Or The Meters. That is why Gadd gets my vote, he is more than good in ANY style. Cannot say that for Elvin Blakey Higgins. Tony W is another kettle of fish, but I think Gadd aces Williams for versatility. I do not know how modern Harvey is in terms of jazz. Nor Mike Clarke. ALL great drummers though. Eric Clapton, who used Gadd, is quoted as saying there are five and he meant five, great drummers in the world. I am not sure if he meant within his genre or just more broadly. But I have played with a few great drummers and I undertand why Clapton would say this. ",

            "answer_text": "Stewart Copeland comes to mind. Although the Police came along as part of a movement that longhairs thought couldn\u2019t play their instruments, the band could really play their instruments. Copeland\u2019s special genius as part of the Police was to put big-time chops into the service of a new style - nervous, jumpy, edgy, neurotic - however you want to describe it. Rather than something ponderous or long-winded he\u2019d groove ferociously, then come in like Seventies icon Muhammad Ali and land a combination, relying on superior footwork all the way. Instead of dropping a bomb he\u2019d leave those splash cymbal accents of his that disappeared faster than Ray-Bans behind some Venetian blinds in a music video. Groove a bit. And then he\u2019d bring the thunder again, but leaving the listener wanting more. ",
