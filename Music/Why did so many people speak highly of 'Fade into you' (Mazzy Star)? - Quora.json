            "answer_text": "Here's what I could gather. This song has a strong folk vibe with a dark, moody theme featuring throughout. The vocals and overall delivery are done in an ethereal manner which adds to and complements the said features. To finish off, the lyrics deals with a theme that we are all familiar with, love and relationships, which makes an alt-rock outfit crossover with the more mainstream audiences. ",
