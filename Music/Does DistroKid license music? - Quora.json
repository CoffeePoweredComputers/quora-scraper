            "answer_text": "No. Please understand that under modern law, copyright is automatic. The moment you record your music in a \u201cfixed form\u201d, it is copyrighted. (And understand as well that \u201ccopyright\u201d is not \u201ccopy protection\u201d; copyright is a set of laws, and the rights you gain under those laws, not some software that prevents copying.) So, DistroKid can\u2019t copyright your music. It\u2019s already copyrighted. Now, while copyright is automatic, registration of copyright is not. To register your copyright, you have to file forms with a copyright registry and, with most registries, pay a fee. Some countries\u2019 governments have a registry \u2014 the US does, for example. In other countries, copyright registries are private entities operating under government regulation, and some countries don\u2019t have registries as all. DistroKid operates in the US, so if they were going to register your copyright on your behalf, they\u2019d have to do so with the US government (and they\u2019d need your permission, which would likely be in their terms of service). I\u2019ll note, though, that registering copyright on a song costs $35, or $55 to register up to ten unpublished works together as a group. Given that DistroKid\u2019s annual fee is less than that, it seems extremely unlikely that they register copyright on your behalf. If they registered any number of songs for you as part of the service they\u2019re providing for $20 a year, they\u2019d rapidly go bankrupt. ",
