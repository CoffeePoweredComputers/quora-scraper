            "answer_text": "I produce some electronic music as a hobby and listen to music for a lot of my waking hours, so sometimes I will hear and think about music I\u2019ve listened to when I am about to drift off to sleep. If you\u2019ve ever spent any time learning and being passionate about a hobby or skill, you will often think about it when you are falling asleep (and probably when you are asleep, as well, but I wouldn\u2019t know about that). Also, I get a constant stream of original musical ideas in the shower. Not just individual parts of songs, I usually hear full songs with percussion, bass, lead instruments, and sometimes even vocal melodies (but not actual lyrics). They are so real that I can hum them out part by part, but they are usually changing faster than I can hold on to them to transpose them onto my computer. This has happened to me for years, and I believe there are a couple components to this: Being comfortable and calm, like in a shower, induces a certain mental stateThe pink noise of the shower is stimulating the auditory part of my brain, which is usually being used for listening to musicThis doesn\u2019t happen during every shower, maybe one in five. They have led to some interesting and completely original melodies to some of my songs, if I am able to hold onto them after I get out of the shower and run down to my midi-keyboard and music editing software. I don\u2019t think many people experience this, and I consider it a great gift, even after asking myself a few difficult questions about the origins of this phenomena: Could this be a result of some kind of past or current brain damage or physical illness that I\u2019ve suffered/or am currently suffering from?Could this be a \u201cbiological marker\u201d or precursory symptom of a mental illness that I have a genetic predisposition for?I\u2019ve been a very healthy person with no chronic symptoms of anything health-related for my entire life, and while I\u2019ve never had a CT scan of my skull to make sure there isn\u2019t some random piece of metal jammed into an auditory center of my brain, there has never been a reason for me to do so. I was sick with meningitis for about a week as a kid and got a few concussions over the years, but no notable brain damage (that I know of). The second question is a bit more difficult to answer. As far as I know, there is no history of mental illness in my family. Even if that were the case, many people hold genes that may be responsible for certain mental illnesses, but they never actually get it. Instead, these genes are sometimes expressed as \u201cbiological markers\u201d, which are typically little more than minor symptoms of a mental illness. Someone with the genes for paranoid delusions, but without a full-fledged mental illness, might experience a \u201cbiological marker\u201d of hyper-attentiveness or enhanced situational awareness, which would be considered beneficial in many situations. A \u201cbiological marker\u201d of having genes that are responsible for full-on auditory hallucinations might be occasionally hearing original music in your head. But do not despair, an overwhelming majority of people go their entire lives with these genes and never experience the tiniest bit of any mental illness. These \u201cmarkers\u201d, if not disrupting to your life or others, are simply traits and innate talents that make you you, like any other personality trait. No matter what the cause of it is, I think this is a great gift, and you should embrace it. Pick up an instrument or try to compose some tunes on some music software when struck with your divine musical inspiration. The world needs more original music, even if it is coming from some kind of brain malfunction. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard music in my head for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m not talking about earworms, although I have had some experience with that too. It\u2019s like a soundtrack playing in my head most of the time and it often it corresponds with what is going on in my thoughts. For example, in a confrontational situation, I might hear Tom Petty singing \u201cI won\u2019t back down\u201d. The song doesn\u2019t have to be anything that I\u2019ve recently heard. Most of the time the music is just running in the background, and I don\u2019t pay much attention to it. It does sometimes draws attention to things that are percolating in the back of my mind when I actually pay attention to what is playing mentally. Sometimes it feels like a connection to my subconscious. The only time it isn\u2019t there, or I\u2019m just not noticing it, is when I\u2019m really focused on something, like a project where I\u2019m using a little more creative brainpower. This makes me think that the music helps keep my brain active on a higher level when I\u2019m not pushing myself as much mentally. That may not be the reason for it, but I think it keeps my mind sharper. I don\u2019t notice it when I have a migraine either. But brain function seems depressed during a migraine. I have aphantasia, which is the inability to form pictures in the mind. I don\u2019t know if that is related in any way, but I do find it interesting that my musical memory is well developed but my visual side is practically non-existent. I started musical training at a young age. I play several different instruments. I do think the musical interest makes a difference. I\u2019m also creative and artistic in a lot of different areas. So, if this is something you are experiencing too. Don\u2019t panic. I had a moment of panic when I first realized that this isn\u2019t the \u2018norm\u2019 and I thought something was wrong. But, I\u2019m well adjusted and I think there may be some benefits. Maybe this is an area that we are gifted in. ",
