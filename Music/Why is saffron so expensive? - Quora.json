            "answer_text": "Nothing, is available in this world that replaces the nutrition values of the Saffron in the equal amount(4 or 5 stamens). Zinc, Vitamin B, manganese, magnesium, potassium, minerals, vitamins A - B complex, Anti depressant compounds etc. For these all you have to eat 5 kg of spinach, 250 gm Almonds, 100 gm walnuts, 500 gm Olives, 6 ltr milk, So its simple and easy to have Saffron\u2019s some stamens (Stigmas or threads) in spite of a bulk a diet. I was too not aware of these values of the saffron. I was only working for the upliftment of the farmers of J&K. I started supplying saffron to the food chains and the Big Hotels. Some of my friends requested me to supply small quantity for their domestic purposes. Some of them use it as a natural Viagra because saffron boosts selenium cells in our body by 27% of any medicine or body supplements. Some of my female friends were pregnant and their elders told them the values of the saffron and they too asked me for the small quantity of saffron but they all were very confidently saying that in the market lots of adulterated saffon is available. They couldn\u2019t trust anybody than their friend who was wasting his life in the upliftment of the others in their view point. At that day i got an other opportunity to serve the society in different manner. I launched an e-commerce website to serve even the 1 gm saffron. That website has variety of the saffron. You want it for the health usage, there is a grade available, if you want it for the cooking purpose only, for the aroma and the color there is a different grade, you want it for the ritual purposes there is a different grade and I CLASSIFIED THESE ALL GRADES ON THEIR NUTRITION VALUES BASIS. For example you don\u2019t need a high nutrition value grade to put a holy mark (Tilaka) on your forehead then why you pay for the high nutrition value grade vis-a-versa. I feel good to serve the upcoming souls with this nature\u2019s gift. My farmer is happy to get the price for the authentic saffron so he doesn\u2019t need to mix other unhygienic elements as he was doing it forcefully under the market pressure. www.kingkesariya.co.in King kesariya got a chance to be highlighted when http://moneybhaskar.com and http://aajtak-indiatoday.com did a story on the success of the King kesariya.

            "answer_text": "Saffron Saffron is the most expensive spice on earth - by a long shot! $7-10,000 per kg for Good quality imported saffron. However for NZ grown saffron you can pay over $35,000 per kg - up to $50,000 per kg for high quality boutique grown organic saffron By comparison ; > Gold - approx $60,000 per kg > Silver - approx $750 per kg > Weed - approx $10,000 to $20,000 per kg > Meth - approx $500,000 per kg This may seem like a crazy price - however, you only use a very tiny bit. I buy it in \"big\" packets (4 grams @ about $30. I cook with a lot of Saffron (I have a few recipes using saffron) yet as a heavy user I would only use about 20 gram per year Why is it so expensive? It is Very VERY labour intensive - yet it is grown in a lot of very poor labour rate countries (Iran, 90% of world production), Greece, Spain, Morocco, India) - it is still very expensive even thou the cost of labour there is very cheap (on world standards) It is a bulb which pops up in mid-Autumn with a wee plant (that looks a bit like chives) which will produce 1 or up to 4 flowers over about 4 weeks. Once it stops flowering interestingly the plant will not die away over the winter - I think this is when the bulbs do their multiplying (this is called \"mother and daughters\") You need to pick the flower on the day it sprouts (because the flower wilts & dies very quickly) albeit depending on the weather I sometimes stretch the harvest out to 3 days. - a 3 day old flower may be a bit wilted but the stigma is still in good enough condition You then very carefully remove the red stigmas - discard the flower The wee three strand stigmas is then dried (dry stigma weighs approximately 1/4 of fresh) - this can be done in the Sun however 10 minutes in a low heat oven works It takes about 150,000 to 200,000 flower stigmas to make 1 kg of dried saffron. To put that in context - that is approx 5 cent per flower (based on $10,000 per kg saffron) I have been growing Saffron for about 10 years - I started with 10 bulbs now I have about 600 (every 2nd year they need to be dug up and split the bulbs up - ie plant all \"daughter\" bulbs out on their own) In 8 years I have produced total of about 5 grams of saffron If I was to value my labour (over 10 years) at the minimum wage my 5 grams is \u201cworth\u201d equivalent of $2.5m per kg. Having said that, 2018 was a bumper crop - about 2 grams (about 250 flowers picked) - that is circa $500,000 per kg Lucky it is only a hobby https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron ",
