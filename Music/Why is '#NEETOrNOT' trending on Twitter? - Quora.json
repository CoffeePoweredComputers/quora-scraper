The exams are held in month of September and it is unfair for the students who are going to given this exam. In the time of panadamic they call students to give exams why I didn't understand till now. They called sops are followed by NTA(national testing agency). Today in 10:00Pm in republic tv network arnab Goswami start live debate and give this Hastag #NEETOrNOT for students. In debate people saying that exams is held only for 3 hour so it's not harmful for students, are u crazy is there covid need one day to spread one body to another or in some second. I don't know how a senior doctor in debate can say that exam are important because it is not dangerous for students. And academic year is going to waste which affect your career bla bla see we are not stupid if collage close summer vacation holiday then it is not hard to complete syllabus in 4 months . I don't know much about that doctor but he is not in favour of students. Students also tensed about transportation, and a white shirt man(parent) said 10% students are not able to transport but it is not fair of 90% students to postpone ghis exams. What is the logic behind it. I don't know.  I don't why he said this also this in below. It was funny.  This man don't know about NTA full from and start debate. It's funny. Because of this students are tweeting about this. ",

            "answer_text": "I think students have lost purpose for what they\u2019re Writing the exams for , it\u2019s an entrance exam to become a doctor ,particularly an MBBS graduate who deals with all sorts of adverse working situations,postings and undergo many hefty conditions with mere incentives .They roam around day and night through patients\u2019 wards where they are Ingrained with variety of infections diseases ( currently,1st years also have some sort of postings too. In new MCI curriculum) they wear masks the whole time( many follow the rule). Even when we used to visit hospital postings in pre-Corona Times we were advised to wear masks in pulmonary postings and medicine postings too. Thus, The people crying to postpone the entrance exam and and constantly Weeping About how they will wear masks. Sorry for being harsh, if they cry for such petty reasons then they don\u2019t deserve MBBS seat.Unnecessary Twitter trends is futile attempt and it sabotages the peace and ambition induced courage of real students who wants to perform rather than bark on INDIAN MEDIA CIRCUS and other platforms now, my opinion over another issue raised by aspirants : Bihar has already unlocked its transport services and And situation of floods is not something new that these people are highlighting and making hue and cry all over . 99% of people have been alloted their first choice centre, NOW WHAT ? Also, There were floods in 2019 ,I think more adverse situation were prevalent in the previous year. Look, Their only motive is to protest and protest and protest and divert and derail the management for the reason unknown. Corona is going nowhere and it is bound to be with us till next year and maybe further . You know whats funny :D They are the same set of people who will again protest in their respective colleges, When syllabus of the first year won\u2019t be completed and exams will be taken in mere 6 months . Its not school anymore And in no way govt. is gonna declare it 0 year, sorry to be quash your far-fetched dream \ud83d\ude02 .Protest culture will take you nowhere, Learn to adjust\u2026its no sweet journey ahead , SWEETIE Indians are suffering from tuberculosis abd stastics show that people die more due to this COVID .The bacteria is present in every third individual either in the resting stage or in the active stage in India. This disease needs more attention according to me .Nobody raises that issue, nobody Raises their voice , ( kyunki itni hype nhi banti na )and put pressure to authorities for necessary steps to be taken to curb this disease. Only Corona, Corona Corona. I very well know it\u2019s a deadly disease and highly infectious, but how long will you procrastinate your dreams and ambitions. Need to live with it duh !!! if the SOP \u2018s are available for this . Give them a chance to atleast implement Talking about your relatives and family members who are at prone risk :if you go for your exam,Honestly answer me one thing,,Will that be the only day they would be the most vulnerable to Corona virus?? Won\u2019t they be remaining vulnerable after that. you have an option to self isolate yourself after giving the exam. and please, let\u2019s be practical over here the crowd outside the examination hall is bound to happen and but that does not mean that it is the only source of the crowd in that city for that particular date. The virus will still spread, people will still form crowd so you can\u2019t challenge the entire idea of conducting exam just for the petty reason of not forming of crowd Sorry for being a political here but you chose the government that clearly failed to contain the virus and now it has reached to the stage of community spread .so, bear with it and SHUT UP Every day your father or any other elderly person has to go out to bring food items and believe Me it doesn\u2019t matter how much you take precaution or maintain sanitising hygiene one cannot evade oneself from being infected by hundred percent. Big celebrities got infected . Until the vaccine don\u2019t arrive one is always vulnerable no matter what\u201d for a particular date or on a particular time\u201d. so ending my views with a tweet  ",
