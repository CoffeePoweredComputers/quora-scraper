It started out as an attempt at a campaign song for Timothy Leary for his short lived attempt at running for governor of California. Leary was sent to prison for marijuana possession before his campaign could even start. \u201cCome Together\u201d was a phrase that Leary used to toss around. John said that he tried to write the campaign song at Leary's request but he just couldn't come up with anything and he came up with the iconic #1 hit instead. ",
