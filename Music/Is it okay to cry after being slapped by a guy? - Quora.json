            "answer_text": "We need never be ashamed of our tears. \u2013 Charles Dickens It's perfectly okay to cry. It's absolutely fine for human beings to cry, as it's one of the biggest needs to keep our physical and mental state perfect.  I wrote this article today itself on my website, so I'll simply copy down the reasons why crying is absolutely normal.  1. Crying helps to release pent up feelings: Sometimes we keep piling on sadness, fear and anxiety on our hearts without sharing it with anyone else. This leads to depression, and makes the aura around us negative. But the moment we have an emotional outburst, all the gloomy emotions flow out, instantly reducing the load of sentiments kept on the heart. You feel lighter and way less anxious. It checks the nervous system of the body regularly, and doesn\u2019t let any stale emotion dwell in the brain. This prevents a person from going into depression.  2. It helps you confront your emotions: When sad, we let the negative feelings take over our heart and mind. This isn\u2019t bad, because this means we are brave enough to face the problems in life rather than running away from them. We allow the negativity to stay in our mind and feel it for some time, but we don\u2019t let it dwell in there for long and release it with our tears. Those who cry a lot aren\u2019t weak people. Rather, they are the ones who are pretty strong to face the troubles of life, feel them and then fight against them successfully. 3. Shedding tears is pretty good for health: Crying releases feel-good hormones like prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, Leu-enkephalin,along with the elements potassium and manganese. It prevents the mind from going into depression and checks the stress and anxiety level of the body. It lubricates our eyes, helping us see better and clearer, prevents dehydration and keeps us healthy. 4. Sobbing in front of someone makes them feel comfortable around you: Generally people keep their emotions to themselves, fearing what others would think of them if they weep in front of them. But opening up to someone emotionally helps build sentimental and social relations with them, making the society a better place to live in. 5. You stop giving a damn to what the world thinks about you: We live in a world where the expression of emotions is discouraged to a weird extent. Crying in front of the world proves that we have denied all the social norms, and don\u2019t give a damn to what people think about us. Crying is actually a characteristic of a balanced, emotionally healthy person. Trust me, if you cry a lot, you're way more emotionally and physically stable that the ones who discourage shedding tears and call it 'womanish'.   I Breathe Pink at Through my conscience. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes!! I think its completely okay to cry. As far as I am concerned, I cry for everything with which I get attached or everyone with whom I get attached. Crying gives so much relief.Plus crying is also healthy considering it does following- * Tears Help Us See   The most basic function of tears is that they enable us to see. Literally. Tears not only lubricate our eyeballs and eyelids, they also prevent dehydration of our various mucous membranes. No lubrication, no eyesight. Writes Jerry Bergman: \"Without tears, life would be drastically different for humans\u2014in the short run enormously uncomfortable, and in the long run eyesight would be blocked out altogether.\" *Tears Kill Bacteria  No need for Clorox wipes. We\u2019ve got tears! Our own antibacterial and antiviral agent working for us, fighting off all the germs we pick up on community computers, shopping carts, public sinks, and all those places the nasty little guys make their homes and procreate.Tears contain lysozyme, a fluid that the germ-a-phobe dreams about in her sleep, because it can kill 90 to 95 percent of all bacteria in just 5-10 minutes! This translates, I\u2019m guessing, to three months\u2019 worth of colds and stomach viruses. * Tears Remove Toxins  Biochemist William Frey, who has been researching tears for as long as I\u2019ve been searching for sanity, found in one study that emotional tears \u2014those formed in distress or grief\u2014contained more toxic byproducts than tears of irritation (think onion peeling). Are tears toxic then? No! They actually remove toxins from our body that build up courtesy of stress. They are like a natural therapy or massage session, but they cost a lot less! * Crying Can Elevate Mood  Do you know what your manganese level is? Neither do I. But chances are that you will feel better if it\u2019s lower because overexposure to manganese can cause bad stuff: anxiety, nervousness, irritability, fatigue, aggression, emotional disturbance, and the rest of the feelings that live inside my head rent-free. *Crying Lowers Stress  Tears really are like perspiration, in that exercising and crying both relieve stress. In his article, Bergman explains that tears remove some of the chemicals built up in the body from stress, like the endorphins leucine-enkaphalin and prolactin. The opposite is true too. Bergman writes, \"Suppressing tears increases stress levels, and contributes to diseases aggravated by stress, such as high blood pressure, heart problems, and peptic ulcers.Source- 7 Reasons Crying Can Be Healthy ",
