            "answer_text": "Professional musicians practice their instrument every day. Those who are truly committed to it practice several hours each day. For classical musicians, they practice regular, proficiency-maintaining routines (scales, arpeggios, etudes, etc), in addition to working out technically difficult parts of the actual pieces they will play at their next performance. For jazz musicians, the practice is somewhat similar, although they spend less time focusing on the compositions they\u2019ll play, and more time practicing scales, patterns, etc. With respect to rehearsals, classical musicians will usually have only a few of them before the performance. If it is a chamber ensemble (or a duo), they may have more than a few rehearsals, as there are fewer logistical issues regarding convening a trio or a quintet for a rehearsal. For larger ensembles (orchestras), there will only be a few rehearsals before a performance. Jazz musicians tend to have regularly scheduled rehearsal sessions, when a group performs frequently, to the point of those rehearsals turning into practice sessions. As for other genres (rock, pop, contemporary, etc), generally, every musician maintains proficiency by practicing alone. Skilled professional ensembles don\u2019t need to practice together; they just rehearse as needed, before the performance. It may be helpful to clarify the difference between practice and rehearsal. Practice is the process of improving one\u2019s musical (technical) ability on one\u2019s instrument. It is also used when one needs to learn a new unknown musical piece. Professional musicians will always practice alone; they very much dislike practicing in a group, as it is always inevitably inefficient. Where one musician may have a difficult passage in the musical piece, the other may have it very easy at that spot, so repeating parts (or all) of the piece until everyone plays it correctly is a colossal waste of time for those who already know it correctly. That is why every professional musician prepares his(her) own part before going to the rehearsal. That time alone allows him to repeat the challenging phrase(s) as many times as needed until he knows them well, without wasting time repeatedly playing through the easy parts of the composition. Rehearsal is the process of putting together the entire musical piece with the whole ensemble. Professional musical ensembles (and groups) will never practice together; they will have rehearsals, which allow them to make sure their joint performance sounds correctly. When each musician has practiced his part and knows it well, they are joined in a rehearsal to play the piece, paying attention to the dynamics (who\u2019s too loud or too soft), musical phrasing, articulation and other elements that shape an ensemble performance. So: Practice: learning the piece (working alone) by repeating difficult passages until no technical mistakes are made in the performance; Rehearsal: playing together with the others, shaping the overall performance of the piece.

            "answer_text": "It greatly depends on the project. I\u2019m jazz/pop focused, so the home preparation is relatively light compared to the months of practice that classical performers endure. That said, some gigs require hours and hours of home preparation, while others require none at all. I don\u2019t know if the tours I\u2019ve gone on fit your definition of \u201cbig tour\u201d, but I\u2019ve done a couple of months or weeks on the road at a time. They were mostly rock, jazz, or soul acts. The major factor is whether I\u2019m expected to reproduce an existing recording precisely or create my own musical ideas within a given context. The former means hours of intensive listening, transcribing, and practice, while the later allows for a dynamic interaction with the other musicians, using the skills and creative capacities I\u2019ve developed over my training and career. The difference could be compared to memorizing lines for production of Shakespeare, vs being interviewed for a podcast on a given topic. One requires a lot of work squashed into the few weeks before the performance, while the other requires a huge pool of knowledge and experience generated over years from which to draw answers in real time, but not a great deal of proximal preparation.
