            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s see, Team 7 wouldn\u2019t be the same. (They\u2019d probably have some irrelevant character take Naruto\u2019s place). The friendship between Naruto and Sasuke wouldn\u2019t exist, and Sakura and Sasuke wouldn\u2019t become all that close as they were in Part 1. Kakashi probably wouldn\u2019t even like the Team and they\u2019d probably fail the bell test (hypothetically speaking). Team 8 wouldn\u2019t be the same and some irrelevant girl would take Hinata\u2019s place. That doesn\u2019t really matter since we don\u2019t see much of Team 8, they\u2019ll just become more transparent. Sasuke would get the curse mark and leave the first chance he gets with no regrets, and since Naruto doesn\u2019t really about Sasuke all that much they wouldn\u2019t try to retrieve him :/ Sakura wouldn\u2019t find the motivation to get stronger and would probably wallow in her misery. Since Sasuke ignores her and hasn\u2019t taught her the true meaning of loneliness, she might fall out of love with him. If Sakura doesn\u2019t get the motivation to become stronger, Kankuro, Chiyo, Gaara and everyone else she\u2019s healed will die. This might not happen if Ino snaps Sakura out of her funk and the two train under Tsunade. Besides that, if Sakura does continue to love him, she\u2019ll probably be killed around the time after he kills Danzo. He\u2019d probably kill Karin at that time too. There would be no one to save Sasuke from darkness and Kakashi would end up killing him or being killed by him. Sasuke cannot be dragged out of darkness and continues his path. Heck he might even team up with Obito and Madara. Naruto and Hinata on the other hand, might get put on the same team with some other irrelevant character. The problem is Naruto wouldn\u2019t get his character development provided by Sakura and Sasuke so he wouldn\u2019t be as strong as he is. He would be friends with Lee since the two are made fun of as dead lasts. Also, his team wouldn\u2019t face any opponents like Zabuza and Haku; meaning no character development. He also won\u2019t face Orochimaru. Now, Naruto\u2019s sensei could be one of the adults who hates him, putting him down constantly. And the other irrelevant teammate of Naruto\u2019s would do the same probably. Naruto wouldn\u2019t get any motivation unless he meets Jiraiya and the two go find Tsunade. If that happens, then Naruto is on the right path. He leaves Konoha with Jiraiya and everything would probably be the same for Hinata\u2019s storyline. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019d be sorted into different teams, so it\u2019d probably be very different. I don\u2019t know who all they\u2019d be sorted with, but I suppose there\u2019s a chance it\u2019d be Neji, at the top of the class, Naruto at the bottom, and maybe Hinata or Tenten as the third member, as they both seem average. Naruto and Hinata might get together sooner, as Hinata would probably gain more confidence sooner, and Naruto\u2019s rivalry would probably be with Neji. I don\u2019t think Neji would ever go dark, but he and Naruto would probably become great rivals and be close. They\u2019d help each other, though I don\u2019t think Naruto would be as strong. ",
