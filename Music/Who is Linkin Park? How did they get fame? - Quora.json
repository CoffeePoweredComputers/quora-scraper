            "answer_text": " The image above is the band's logo, by the way.  From left to right, Chester Bennington (vocals), Joe Hahn (sampling and turntables), Mike Shinoda (keyboards, guitars, vocals, rapping and producing), Rob Bourdon (drums), Brad Delson (guitars) and Dave Phoenix Farrel (bass guitars). Now, prepare yourself for a nice, long rant.   Firstly, to clarify, Linkin Park is not an individual artist but is a band; but I can't blame you for assuming that it's a person, that's the same mistake I once made.  The band was founded by high-schoolers Mike Shinoda (keyboards, guitars, vocalist, producer and rapper), Brad Delson (guitars) and Rob Bourdon (drums). Their band was originally called Xero. Joe Hahn (turntables and sampling), Dave Phoenix Farrel (bass guitar) and Mark Wakefield (vocals) were other members.  Zero didn't fare well leading to Mark Wakefield's departure.   That's when Chester Bennington (vocals) was introduced into the band. The band's name was changed to Hybrid Theory and later to Linkin Park after which they released their breakthrough debut album titled \"Hybrid Theory\" after being able to sign a deal with Warner Records. This deal was signed after a long struggle because the band combined Rock and Rap elements for the first time and several people believed that this wouldn't work.  Within the first week, Hybrid Theory sold 46 thousand copies in the US.   While Linkin Park is the most famous for their first two albums, 'Hybrid Theory' and 'Meteora', they also continued their career by experimenting and changing their style.  The band grew for almost two decades without any particular genre. The band released seven studio albums in all, covering the genres Pop, Alternative Rock, Electronic Rock, Rap Rock and nu-metal. The band became important to fans because of widely relatable lyrics and because the art they made saved lives. The band also started a program called 'Music For Relief' to help the planet and provide relief for areas struck by natural disasters.  The band that started off with members who were angst-ridden found adults, matured over the course of their careers as humble and fun-loving artists who love to experimentation.

            "answer_text": "Who is Linkin Park: an American rock band. They are a combination of alternative rock, electronic rock, rap-rock and grunge, also experimented with electro-pop or heavy metal. How did they get fame? Well, they started being relevant when singer chester Bennington joined them, he was one of the best singers ever in rock, from a soft pop voice to a more hardcore singing. Also they were very innovative and ahead of the time because as I said, they experimented with a lot of rock subgenres and every song was a surprise full of new fresh sounds; for example, they were already showing a DJ on stage or dubstep before it became a thing.
