            "answer_text": "Perhaps this question is more about buzzing on the lips and the mouthpiece and the connection with the real playing? If so then I think the buzzing on the lips and mouthpiece is like playing on a trumpet with almost no resistance and no feedback. Some people can do that by nature, some can learn to do it and some like me fail in it. It could be that those who can do it have a much more relaxed, more natural approach with less physical problems, more endurance, better high register, more harmonics in the tone . I do sound nice but it has always been on the round, dark side. I wonder if there are any trumpet geniuses who can\u2019t buzz either. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual vibrations originate in your lips, There are plenty of videos to prove that. Look up \u201cWilktone\u201d or Pops McClaughlin. How that is taught is another issue. Some teachers advocate \u201cfree buzzing\u201d, buzzing the lips all by them selves, no trumpet no mouthpiece as a lip strengthening etude. Some teachers advocate mouthpiece buzzing again as an etude or lip strengthener. Some teachers are against all of that, saying that the buzzing starts in the interaction of the horn and the lips. All are good teachers who produce good players. Check out TrumpetHerald.com, TrumpetMaster.com, and TPIN where there is no shortage of discussions, even arguments on this subject. ",

Without buzzing your lips, you can: hit something with the trumpethit the trumpet with somethingclick the valves up and down to make a soft noisesing into it to give a muffled wail as if you were down a drainpipeas Sophie suggested, you can try to fit a sax mouthpiece on the thing, but it would sound odd, and if it responded to valve changes, you might be able to get seven bad notes out of it, but I doubt it.But would it sound anything like a trumpet? No. ",

For any sound to be produced, according to science, there has to be vibration. The better the vibration, the clearer the sound. If you want sound, you need vibration. The metal coils can\u2019t do it for you, in case you\u2019re wondering, so you need to buss in order to create sound. ",
