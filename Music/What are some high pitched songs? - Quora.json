            "answer_text": "When you say \u201chigh pitched\u201d one singer comes to mind. Minnie Riperton (mother of SNL alum Maya Rudolph) had a phenomenal voice and the ability to sing and enunciate clearly into the whistle range. Her brilliant career was cut short by breast cancer and she died July 12, 1979 at 31. On \u201cYou Take My Breath Away\u201d she hits F7. Don\u2019t try this at home kids! The rest of the song is not particularly high but those notes are. Anyway here it is.  In the realm of high or falsetto male vocals there are lots. Axl Rose would come to mind then quickly exits it. A more interesting choice is Klaus Nomi. A deeply eccentric performer who sang back up for David Bowie on his 1979 appearance on SNL Nomi was a countertenor who used operatic techniques and flourishes in pop songs to create vocal effects unlike anyone else in pop music. He died in 1983 as one of the early victims of the AIDS epidemic. On \u201cDing Dong the Witch is Dead\u201d Nomi hits C#6. It is super high but for sheer fun his \u201chit\u201d \u201cAfter the Fall\u201d is my favorite.  ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously many songs by Queen would qualify but I will focus on some not so obvious. Stryper song Honestly truly a beautiful song.  Cheap Trick with The Flame  Sheriff had a great song When I\u2019m With You but it doesn\u2019t get high pitched until the end of the song.  How could you have include a Prince song and this is really shows his great range.  Could resist yet another Prince song with yet more fantastic range  Sammy Hagar with Kama not high pitch through out but it has it\u2019s moments like many Sammy songs and is very difficult to sing, just try.
