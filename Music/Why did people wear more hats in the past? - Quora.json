            "answer_text": "People wore hats more in the past because of social context and evolving technology.  The societal norm in the west is to bare one's head indoors. That means we saw more hats in the past, but we saw them outdoors. As already mentioned here, hats convey social status, style, shade, and warmth... outdoors.  Two major technologies have had a devastating effect on hat manufacturing. Firstly, climate control drove everyone off the streets and into offices. Modern ductwork, clean and smoke free work spaces, reliable heat and air conditioning have swept people out of the streets.  The other culprit over the last forty years or so is the electronic office. Not only is the office more comfortable from a climate perspective, but we have been burdened increasingly by telephones, faxes, email and video conferencing to the point that we seldom leave the confines of home or office for fear of being disconnected.  The fedora, bowler or panama hardly has a chance to get settled before we duck back inside and must doff it once again.  There is hope however from mobile technology. Perhaps smart phones and tablets will allow the office drones to walk the streets once more. Bright sunshine and LCD screens could lead to a renaissance of wide brims to shade our screens. I hope so.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at an old photo of a crowd of people in hats - cloth caps or bowlers or top hats - you get a real sense of social unity, of the individual subsumed into a group. As that social consenus has diversified, hats have become less of a social marker. When I was growing up in the 70s, no one wore hats, except to make a 'retro' statement. 'No hat' was the new 'hat'. George Orwell, back in the thirties, commented on a book by the late Victorian author George Gissing, in which a character loses his hat on a train, and is so embarrassed to be seen hatless in public that he 'borrows' money he is carrying for his employer to buy a new one - the beginning of his downfall.  Orwell pointed to this as an example of how quickly social conventions change - he observed that the plot-device would only work in his day, fifty years later, if the character had somehow lost his pants...
