            "answer_text": "Most brakes on American cars are called self energized. The hydraulic wheel cylinder has a piston for each shoe. The shoes have a strut between them. The rear shoe has a lever for applying the brake. The lever is operated by a cable. Each brake on the axle has these components. When the driver depresses the foot operated parking brake control or pulls the hand brake, it pulls the center cable. It has a slack adjuster. The center cable pulls the equalizer which attaches to the rear cable for each wheel. When a rear cable pulls. It is pulling on the lever pinned to the rear of the two shoes on that brake. At the same action taking place, the lever meets the strut between the two shoes. The strut is pushed toward the front shoe. It meets the steel web of the shoe in it's notch. Applying more pressure forces the shoe and it's brake lining against the drum face. Or the machined inside diameter of the drum. This creates a fulcrum action for the upright brake lever to make it's upper end use it's attaching pin to apply the rear shoe . When the driver releases the foot lever on the parking brake control or releases the hand brake, the cables on many applications are suspended by a return spring. This pulls the cables toward release and reduces their movement. The cables also have return springs on and around their lever end. These make the upright lever return at the lower end. This relaxes the rear shoe.This action simultaneously let's off pressure on the strut and relaxes the front shoe. The strut is preloaded by it's surrounding spring and it is returned and suspended from rattling.. The rear shoes are adjusted for their being close to the drum face by a threaded star wheel adjuster. It is similar to a strut and spans the distance between the lower end of the shoes at their application notches. My use of the word strut here refers to a flat link that spans a horizontal distance. The star wheel adjuster is advanced by a \u201c kicker \u201c which is a Tang or tab that is suspended by a spring and a light cable attached to the apply pin at the top of the backing plate where the shoes meet above their apply notches for the wheel hydraulic cylinder. These type brakes advance the star wheel when the driver backs up and applies the service brake pedal. Self adjusting. The star wheels are threaded left and right for their respective sides of the vehicle. The self energized brake is so called because the forward turning drum will have the front shoe come in contact with it and try to take it in a rotation around the axle shaft and backing plate, with the drum. This causes it's connection to the starwheel and the rear shoe at the bottom to energize the rear shoe and \u201cwrap\u201d it into the drum face. The rear shoe butts against the apply pin, And is so applied. Releasing the service brake relaxes pressure at the wheel cylinder and the process ceases and the parts return due to their return springs. The surrounding parts are inclusive and arranged and designed to work as a brake whether applied by hydraulic pressure or mechanically by cables. They can be used to slow the vehicle. This is why they used to be called emergency brake. But since everything is lighter weight now the parking brake parts are not called that anymore. The driver can select a lower gear to use engine braking and pump the service brake. But pulling the parking brake is done slow and careful in a stop during a possible failure. You cannot depend on a parking brake. So don't leave it as your last resort or part of your stopping plan you can count on. It's designed now to hold a stationary vehicle in place on an incline. When parking. The other styles of brake drum systems also use many of the same parts. They differ in some way due to smaller lighter applications. For example, the fixed anchor design. It does not self energize. The shoes have a stop at the bottom and are individually used against the drum, at the top. Applying the parking brake does essentially the same actions as the other systems. Releasing the parking brake returns it as the other systems do. You should get a book on the subject at your library or parts store so you can refer to it. The pictures and drawings go quite a ways to help you learn and understand brakes and their parts. But the precautions and warnings are most important. Taking action on a vehicles system you are not trained and certified for can result in serious harm, loss of life or severe property damage. You can call your parts store or a shop if you have questions. Many shops offer inspection and want you safe. They are there to help you be safe on the road. They often will take a look at a brake issue during a free inspection. They may also show you and write a free estimate. If no parts are required for access, or the parts aren't excessively labor intensive to access. The more you learn about your system, the better you can care for it. Don't ever pour anything into your brake fluid except dot 3 from an unopened container. Experience teaches about the color and smell of fresh brake fluid. Leaving it around sitting open on shelves destroys it's effectiveness. Dot 4 also is compatible. It has a slightly higher boiling point in it's \u201cwet\u201d state, having drawn water from the air. It is equally hygroscopic, equally corrosive, and costs more. Servicing your brakes includes replacing the fluid. Would you replace it with more expensive fluid? Or would you do it slightly more liberally and use the less expensive dot 3 ? It's your money to spend. If you are not working on a multi circuited system and taking it to some extreme? No difference can be perceived in brake fluid effectiveness between the two. But that system and those circumstances' possibility makes some carmakers say to use the more expensive fluid. Dot4 ",
