            "answer_text": "There are a lot of ways!! The key is finding some harmony that the two keys share and \u201cpivoting\u201d on that chord (thus giving it the designation \u201cpivot chord.\u201d) Things to establish first - Within a single key, IV chords (can) lead to V chords and V chords (usually) lead to I chords, but chords can be reinterpreted to have multiple functions, simultaneously serving one harmonic purpose in the \u201cfrom\u201d key and another in the \u201cto\u201d key (in this case, B flat and C respectively). The simplest choice for a quick pivot in this instance is the F major chord. Able to act as both the V chord in they key of B flat and the IV chord in C, you can pivot on the F major and (if you\u2019d like) move directly to a G major (the V chord in C), which will then place you squarely in the key of C. The chord progression will look something like this: B flat major (I) - D minor (iii) - G minor (vi) - F major (V) - B flat major (I) - D minor (iii) - G minor (vi) - F major (B flat - V / C - IV) - G major (C - V) - [C major] And to make the rhythm pleasant maybe play another measure (or whatever duration is the main harmonic rhythm) of G major after this, perhaps adding a 7th (in this case, F natural) to lean even more strongly towards the key of C. There are, of course, more complex ways of getting to a G major harmony from an F major (and still more ways with varying degrees of complexity if you choose to travel to C directly from the G minor or the D minor), but this was a good, clean way to explain pivot chords (poorly). Ideas for further elaboration - instead of going directly from IV to V in C (F to G), head from IV to a first inversion flat II (a D flat major chord with an F natural at the bottom for pleasing continuity with the previous F major) and then to G; or go through some sort of D minor sonority (Dm7, Dm9, etc) between F and G. Both of these options lead the ear more strongly towards the G major (your entry point into the key of C), making it sound less sudden and introducing the key change rather elegantly. But that might not be what you want. Play with it! Edit: I should mention that music doesn't always follow the rules and if you'd rather not go through G, it can be done. A cadence of V-I (or G to C) is called an \u201cauthentic cadence\u201d and is traditionally the \u201cright\u201d way to cadence, but is not the only way to arrive or stay in a key. One slightly striking way to modulate using alternatives to V-I is to play an F minor chord directly following the F major and suddenly arriving in C via a \u201cplagal\u201d cadence from the chromatically altered iv chord (F minor, altered from IV, or F major, the reinterpreted former V chord).

            "answer_text": "A lot depends on the context of your song in progress, but you\u2019ve got good options since three of your chords are strongly related to C major. Bb and F are the \u201cother\u201d major chords in C-mixolydian (being the bVII and IV respectively), and the C-major chord itself is pretty easy to get to in Bb, being the secondary dominant. I just monkeyed around a bit on my portable keyboard and the modulation I liked takes advantage of the fact that Dm is a weak minor chord in Bb (the iii) but a strong minor in C (the ii). So I liked the following progression: Bb | F | Dm | C Bb | Dm | C | C Now that we are hanging out around C, we pull the trick: C | Am | G | F You\u2019ve now played the four strongest C-major chords in a row - literally the Axis of Awesome and Doo-Wop progression chords just a little out of order. You\u2019ve also spent four of the last twelve measures on C, and both ended and begun phrases with it. Start the next phrase again with C, and you can do something like this: C | Am | F | G C | F | G | G Or whatever suits you. To my ear, once that third four-bar phrase is over, Bb is just a memory. If you\u2019re in a hurry, it sounds to me like you can cut out some of the middle above, and go straight for: Bb | F | Dm | C C | Am | F | G I\u2019m sure there are other good ways to get there; for instance, Eb and Ab are both \u201cborrow chords\u201d for C-major from the parallel minor.
