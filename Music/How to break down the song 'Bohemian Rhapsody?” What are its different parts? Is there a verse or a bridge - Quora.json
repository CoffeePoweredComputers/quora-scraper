            "answer_text": "Now, that is a question. Let\u2019s look into this. We will have to do so without sheet music, because most of our readers don\u2019t read, and I don\u2019t have any Queen sheet music and am not going to buy any just to answer this. Bohemian Rhapsody is, to put it mildly, unconventional in form. It cannot be represented by any of the usual shorthands that we use to refer to song form in popular music. But it is as susceptible to analysis as any other piece of music that conforms to conventional Western harmony. It is 5 minutes 54 seconds long, at least the version of it that I have from the 1975 album A Night at the Opera. I am not aware of any alternative versions. Let\u2019s go: THE INTRO 0.00\u20130.13: (\u2018Is this the real life\u2019)\u2014I hear this as a vi-II-V-I progression that lands on the tonic Bb on \u2018escape from reality\u2019. 0.14\u20130.21: piano enters (\u2018Open your eyes\u2019), and here the harmony changes, going from the relative minor G minor to a dominant 7th chord on the tonic (\u2018Look up to the skies\u2019) because we\u2019re about to enter an area of harmonic instability. 0.22\u20130.31: transitional section (\u2018I\u2019m just a poor boy\u2019), ii-V, ending at \u2018Because I\u2019m\u2026\u2019 0.32\u20130.38: this bit is something that no classical composer would do: the melody moves in sneaky little semitones above and then below the tonic. (\u2018Easy come, easy go\u2019). But pay attention. Because this bit is going to come back in a big way. 0.39- 0.48: another transitional section (\u2018Any way the wind blows\u2019), the harmony going from IV to a first inversion of I, then a first inversion of IIdom7, then a Vdom7. Why? Because of voice leading. We\u2019re in Bb major right now, remember. The G-F-E-F movement mirrors the melody, the G being the mediant of the IV chord, the F being the dominant of the tonic chord, E being the mediant of the II chord. You can hear that E ringing out in the harmony of \u2018Doesn\u2019t really matter to meee\u2026\u2019 0.49: the song gets going. THE POWER BALLAD So here\u2019s the basic harmonic pattern of the verse in \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019. Upper case means major, lower case means minor. (I) Mama, just (vi) killed a man, put a (ii) gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he\u2019s (V) dead, (I) Mama, life has (vi) just begun, but (ii) now I\u2019ve gone and (IIb!) thrown it (I) all (V (F/A)) away, (transitioning stepwise down to:) (IV, except we\u2019re now tonicizing E flat\u2014treating it as, temporarily, the new key of the song\u2014so really it feels like a new I, so let\u2019s just go with that) Mama, oooo-oo-oo- (vi, which is now C) oooo, (ii, moving stepwise down to the new V which is B flat) Didn\u2019t mean to make you cry, if (V) I\u2019m not back again this time to- (I, moving down to vi) -morrow, carry on, carry on, cause (iv, oh the humanity!) nothing really matters. (1.43\u20131.48) transitional passage back to the actual tonic Bb, IV-I-Idim-ii-I. Then we have the same pattern again, in the next verse. Except, on the second run, it does something different. Because Freddie Mercury will not be confined by your song forms, hell no. We get to the bit where the song tonicizes E flat as predicted, on: (I) Mama, oooo-oo-oo- (vi) oooo, (ii, moving down to V) I don\u2019t wanna die, I (V) sometimes wish I\u2019d never been born at all\u2026 GUITAR SOLO The guitar solo is in E flat, and for most of its length it repeats the pattern we saw in the last part of the verse, except for: 2.56\u20133.02: by means of some exceptional cunning, instead of resolving back to B flat by way of all that voice leading the song has been teaching us to expect, the bass line on what would be I don\u2019t wanna die part of the guitar solo proceeds stepwise from F-E-Eb-D to C#, holding on there just long enough to know that we\u2019re off somewhere totally different now, because this C# is then repeated on a stepwise descent to a completely new tonic of A major, of which it is of course the mediant. THE OPERA BIT Whew! We have entered entirely new harmonic territory. But only for about eighteen seconds. Harmonic territory, yes, but not thematic. The very first item that is brought to our attention is; 3.06\u20133.08: (\u2018I see a little silhouetto of a man\u2019) \u2014 this feels somehow vaguely familiar. Why? Because we last heard it two and a half minutes ago! Remember \u2018Easy come, easy go, little high, little high, little low\u2019? Exact same motif, but now it\u2019s in a different key, and played faster, or as we like to put it in music theory, in diminution. (Thanks to Tom Serb for correcting my terminology,) No, this has nothing to do with diminished scales. It\u2019s just music theory fucking with you. 3.09\u20133.12: (\u2018Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\u2019) In strictly Schenkerian terms, this is really just three plagal cadences separated from each other by some superficial pissing about, but it still works. 3.12\u20133.15: (\u2018Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me\u2019) \u2014 this bit had me bamboozled for quite a while, because the voice leading consists of stepwise movement upwards towards the tonic A, which didn\u2019t seem to make any sense and yet obviously it feels like it makes sense. It took a lot of listens and a shamefully long time for me to realise that in fact it makes sense in terms of an only slightly modified motion anticlockwise around the circle of fifths: III-VI-IIaug-V-I, or in chord terms, C#maj-F#maj-Baug-Emaj-Amaj. 3.16\u20133.19: (\u2018Galileo!\u2019) Yeah, we\u2019re at the \u2018easy come, easy go\u2019 motif again. It moves downwards to the V on \u2018Figaro\u2019, whereupon we get: 3:20\u20133.21: (\u2018Magnificoooo!\u2019) Yeah\u2014this is where Queen cheats, sort of, because this spectacular piece of vocal overdubbage is in Eb, arbitrarily shifting the key and distracting our attention from the fact that they\u2019re doing so by means of vocal pyrotechnics. I mean, it\u2019s pop music, they don\u2019t have to obey the usual constraints. But this is the one point in the song where I, as a music theorist, see the cracks. 3.22\u20133.31 (\u2018I\u2019m just a poor boy, nobody loves me\u2019) This is that easy come, easy go motif yet again, but now it serves as a major structural pivot in the song, because this is where the song begins to move into one of the most epic examples of dominant prolongation in popular music: I mean the practice of holding off resolving to the key that you think of as the home one, by hanging on as long as possible to the dominant chord. In this case, I\u2019m just a poor boy feels like it ought to be the tonic, until He\u2019s just a poor boy, from a poor family hammers home its own assertion as the tonic by means of a plagal cadence and a transitional passage (3.32\u20133.34) back to the dominant B flat. 3.34\u20134.06: (\u2018Easy come, easy go\u2019 up until \u2018for meeeeeeeeee\u2019) Okay, in analytical terms, all this Bismillah! carry-on, along with the shift to F major on the goo-oo-ooo-ooo-ooo and the subsequent bad-tempered stomp through B-A-D-C#-F#-Bb-Eb (\u2018No, no, no, no, no, no, no\u2019) is just brilliantly conceived smoke and mirrors in aid of that dominant prolongation I was talking about. If you don\u2019t believe me, start anticipating the return to E flat as early as the I\u2019m just a poor boy mentioned above. I did this, this morning, while listening to the song and thinking about how I was going to write this answer, and the tension built up so much that when it finally returned to the tonic E flat at the beginning of the hard rock section, my right arm instinctively jerked as if I were hitting the riff on guitar. THE HARD ROCK BIT 4.07\u20134.14: Well, it seems to be in E flat, but this turns out to be yet another tonicization: when the riff moves up to F, we realise that the home key is in fact good old B flat. Or is it? 4.15\u20134.42: (\u2018So you think you can stop me and spit in my eyes\u2019) Here again, the song exploits the ambiguity between two keys a perfect fourth apart, sometimes treating one of them as the tonic, at other times treating the other one as the tonic. But really, this bit isn\u2019t about harmonic movement, it\u2019s about timbre and pace and aggression. 4.45\u20134.54: by means of a transitional passage we move to B, then A flat, then B flat as yet another prolonged dominant\u2014then we go to: THE POWER BALLAD (REPRISE) 4.55\u20135.11: We\u2019re back to E flat, for a gently subsiding transitional passage that demonstrates once again this band\u2019s gift for voice leading: Deacon\u2019s bass in particular is doing double duty here in making the various chord changes make sense. 5.12\u20135.54: The coda. (\u2018Nothing really matters\u2019) It\u2019s a more developed version of the earlier iv-I Nothing really matters bit, only hitting the minor iv at 5.22. The piano takes up the earlier plagal cadences from three minutes in and immediately disrupts them with yet more of the line clich\u00e9 voice leading, dropping down to a C major, which turns out to be the dominant of a final F major (\u2018Any way the wind blows\u2026\u2019.) Well, shit. The very first harmony in the song was G minor (\u2018Is this the real life?\u2019). And by the magic of music, we have arrived at F major. In traditional analytical terms, the whole of \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 can be sketched out as an epic ii-V-I change. (Edit: Well, not really, because too much of the song takes place in B flat and E flat. But it does go to show just how much the song both obeys and flouts the conventions of classical harmony.) I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this little jaunt through the twists and turns of a song. \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 is in many ways a daft song, but I think my analysis demonstrates some of the art that went into it. Happy listening. ",
