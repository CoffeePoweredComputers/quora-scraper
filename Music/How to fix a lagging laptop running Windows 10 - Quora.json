            "answer_text": "It depends on the perceived issues, but starting from \u201cmost hardware bound\u201d: how much time has passed since laptop was cleaned/blowed with compressed air (with a toothpick sticked between the fan blades - they work worse after being forced to spin). If laptop has more than 2 years, or 6+month and was used in the bed, on cushion, or house with tendency to dust buildup(downtown, close to construction site) it may throttle thermally - if you\u2019ll right-click on the menu bar and chose \u201ctask manager\u201d, you\u2019ll see where the issue might stem from - whether it\u2019s CPU, RAM or HDD at close to 100%.how old the laptop is anyway? the laptop hard drives tend to \u201cdie\u201d relatively quickly - their performance is more often than not sub-par compred to what you put to regulat desktop. It could be noticed easily if in aforementioned task manager the drive hovers at 100% a lot of time. There are three potential solutions, only one having high success rate. disk defragmenting(usually done by windows in the background); removing crap software; replacing with SSD. Only replacing spinning drive with SSD has high success rate in this scenarioremove more software. check startup folder(autostart tab in task manager) and \u201cdisable\u201d auto updaters, office, Adobe, whatever you don\u2019t use or don\u2019t intend to use every day. The more software you have(especially if a lot tends to fulfill same task, like multiple \u201cmedia players\u201d or whatever), the worse your computer will get.download \u201conline antivirus\u201d. below you have screenshot with sites that you should get. chose 2 at random to scan fully your laptop for best results/piece of mind 5. go get some money? If at this point (cleaning, removing unnecessare apps, purging malicious software) you are not satisfied with the results - again, you didn\u2019t specify the issue you\u2019re having - buy a new laptop. with nvme storage, 16gb of ram, true quad core cpu and ok-to-great dedicated gpu. The thing is, Windows optimizes itself - all you can do is kill/permamently disable some services you deem as not useful; lower the visual effects on the desktop/menus; disable indexing, some other small-scale crap. That\u2019s it. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of users regularly complain about the slow and laggy Windows 10 after installing or updating. This lag in the machine won\u2019t cause any major issues but it will make your overall Windows experience quite annoying. The slow and laggy Windows will waste a lot of your time and which sometimes costs more than anything. To start with, you need to understand what is causing the issue of computers running slow. Locating the Resource Draining Programs: There are some programs that might be excessively using your resources which leads to a computer running slow issues. To find such programs, you should head to your Task Manager. Right-click on the taskbar, select the \"\u02dcTask Manager' and press the combination of Ctrl+Shift+Escape to access it. Click on CPU, Memory, and Disk headers to know which applications are the reason for the computer running slow. End Task or force close to terminate the application to fix the computer running slow issue.  Close System Tray Programs: There are applications that run in the system tray or the notifications area. These are the ones that are launched at startup, and keep running in the background for a considerable amount of time, but remain hidden behind the arrow icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. You can click the arrow icon that falls close to the system tray and right-click on the applications that you don't wish are running in the background. Simply close them to free up your crucial resources. Often, these applications are a major reason for your computer running slow.  Disable Startup programs: You have to right-click on the taskbar and select the \"\u02dcTask Manager' or use the combination of \"\u02dcCtrl+Shift+Escape' in order to launch it. You can then move over the startup tab and disable the startup applications you don't require running. Windows will be instrumental in guiding you through the entire process. The issue of computers running slow can be fixed using this method as well.  Reduce the Animations running: Windows tends to run a lot of animations, each of which can cause your PC to slow down, and therefore, it is advisable that you disable these animations. One can press the Windows key+ X or right-click on the Start button and select \"\u02dcSystem'. Then move over to the \"\u02dcAdvanced System Settings' on the left pane and choose the \"\u02dcSettings' button under the Performance tab. You then have to choose the option, \"\u02dcAdjust for best performance under Visual Effects to disable all the animations', or select \"\u02dcCustom' and remove the individual animations you are not interested in using to fix a computer running slow issues.  Get a RAM upgrade: This is another option available to users who wish to overcome the issue of low memory error. Every system has a maximum capacity for RAM ports. For the ones using 2GB RAM, they can check for another port to install the RAM manually, and so on, as this solves the problem of low memory successfully. The difference is visible the moment you install the RAM. Install, reboot, and get going. Once done, this can actually eliminate the issue of your computing running slow as it offers additional space for your applications to be processed, and also at a greater pace. The malware and adware: They can be rightly called as crapware. These are the programs that make a total waste of system resources. It is therefore an advent fact that the user needs to delete malware to get the issue resolved. These programs are sometimes installed when the downloads are made from unreliable sources. It is therefore one of the most faced issues by the users. The user should therefore install a top-notch antivirus program to get the problem resolved completely. Disk Cleanup: The disk cleanup utility should be used to ensure that the problem is never faced or minimized. The disk clean utility is the program that has been embedded within. The user can apply the techniques of this program to get the issue resolved in full.  Uninstall the useless programs: Within the control panel > program and features > uninstall a program the user can get the list of installed programs. The same interface can be used to uninstall the programs that are not required at all. Uninstalling the useless programs will allow the users to ease the system to its full capacity. The ways mentioned here are effective and reliable to overcome the issues!! ",
