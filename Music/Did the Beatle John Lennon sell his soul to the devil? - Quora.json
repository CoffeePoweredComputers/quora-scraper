            "answer_text": "Oh! Well of course he did\u2026..and since he and Paul McCartney did absolutely everything together at that time he was right there along side of him at the crossroads. Let's never allow ourselves to be confused by the facts, yeah?! Their success has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that as a band they honed their skills since they were teenagers playing gigs in clubs in Liverpool, across England and Scotland and then in Hamburg where they played to a grueling schedule. Losing two members who amounted to dead wood then adding the bass to Paul's repitoir then Richard, call me Ringo Starr, Starkey to drums didn't affect their sound at all, right? In fact that is probably why Paul became such an iconic bassist and multi instrumentalist, it was the bloody pact with Satan, Old Jack, Beelzebub, or simply the devil at the root of it all! Brilliant! It would also explain how he managed to escape death in '66 and is still very much alive and healthy even nearing his seventy eighth birthday! Maybe he added an immortality clause whereas John opted to go out young in a blaze of glory before his mouth would inevitably overload his arse. Another episode of the stupid question manual, folks pay them no heed please. ",

There\u2019s no refutable evidence out there to prove it. There\u2019s no such thing either as devils, gooks, and goblins; they are just no more than a figment of the imagination. Just some crack pot who is looking to start a grass fire. The just world hypothesis carries no weight in trying to figure out why John Lennon was murdered on December 8, 1980. It doesn\u2019t make an ounce of sense to go there. There have been so many books that have come out since then, but none of them have the correct answer, or at the very least they are trying to make sense out of something that never made any sense and never will. There is absolutely no way or justification for Lennon\u2019s homicide. Homicide was a vile act of depravity, committed by an uncontrolled madman (Chapman) who needed nothing more than to be strong armed and captured, but somehow fell through the cracks of the US Justice System.

I don't think John Lennon expected to become one of the most famous figures of all time just from singing and playing guitar in a little band he started just a few short years before. How could he have known? Do I literally think he did so? No. John was way too human and prone to mistakes. He was a searcher, looking for spiritual truths and maybe a way to get through the craziness that became his life. He was a man with feet of clay. Perhaps the largeness of his humanity is what touched us all. He belonged to the world, and the world is better for having known him, even if it was for such a short time. ",
