            "answer_text": "Their business model is quite risky to say the least. The bet is that they'll be able to upsell additional paying services to artists under the free plan, their pricing page gives an idea of some options. At MIDEM 2 years ago they also presented various partnerships with some other companies, where artists could use/buy (it was not clear) some services for (self)promotion. Never heard of it since then. All these companies offering 100% royalties do the same calculation / assumption: the average indie artist has no more than 1-2 albums at most, and most of them won't sell anything, so why bother spending time and energy in accounting and take a % on their hypothetical sales? In terms of business model, it's much better to sell them some yearly subscriptions or various optional packages (preferably based on a subscription model to ensure a recurring revenue for the company).
