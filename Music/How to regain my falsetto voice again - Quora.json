            "answer_text": "okay once again like I said on here people ask a very vague questions falsetto voice has so many different factors that factor into it first of all are you male or female usually falsetto voice is attributed to just males as many people think it's useless for a woman to sing falsetto because pretty much a woman's natural singing voice is already falsetto see us women we slide into it and you men kind of skip and do it I don't know\u2026without hearing a sample of your voice and what your voice condition is or knowing are you a baritone are you a tenor or you know what range are you in if you have a healthy voice you should be able to sing all the pictures in your range like you usually do. anyway to answer your question you might actually be pretty delighted when you hear the answer. The number one reason why you probably lost most of your ability to sing falsetto is because you have been I believe you said you were performing 5 6 days a week that's your sole source of income which means you are training vigorously so your singing ability is changing and that's a good thing so now you have to focus on what your singing style is now it'll change all the time. for example when I was younger I used to be able to hit all the high notes I was a first soprano and could you Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston with a snap of my fingers today now that I'm 40 not sure of age has anything to do with it my voice has become raspier and it's almost impossible to hit those really high notes most of the time and I recognize this it doesn't make me a bad singer it's just made my style change. I could tell you all the other answers but there are so many of them it just depends you could have nodules in your vocal cords you know you can have an ear nose throat problem maybe when you were saying falsetto you were going through puberty I don't know I didn't even know your age however there are so many things that factor into this your falsetto voice should still be there you just got to retrain it. now like me I do a lot of singing on like karaoke apps and I have a horrible phone I know people may think I'm using this as an excuse but first of all it's horrible quality not to mention that the phone is trying to catch up to me when I'm saying so there is a lag which makes it double worse do you have any issues with your sound system so as you can see there are many factors that factor into this I hope you like my answer thank you\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say if we don\u2019t know what happened for it to go away\u2026 are you sick or were you sick? did you yell or sing too hard to the point where your voice just blew and now that part of your voice is \u201cgone\u201d? How long has it been since this happened? If it\u2019s one of those two and it\u2019s fairly recent (like, a few hours or even a few days), I\u2019d suggest resting your voice because your vocal folds might be swollen. If it\u2019s not, try humming really softly up in head voice with as little effort as possible. Don\u2019t force it but simply go to the highest pitch that\u2019s comfortable and play around there for a bit. This should help you decompress that range and hopefully get your falsetto back. If It\u2019s a matter of technique, it means you need to work on your head voice as this is heavily tied with your falsetto so I\u2019d recommend checking out The Four Pillars of Singing because the entire course focusses on connecting your lower register to that higher head voice register seemlessly. Good luck and hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "How do I get my watch back? Unfortunately you have asked a question without explanation. Where did it go? how did it go? The male falsetto, is a false voice above the natural vice, which sounds white and slightly shrill, it also may be considered to represent an imitation of a female voice. It is unlikely to have gone away, so if you pitch softly into the head voice, and feel the resonance of the highest register, (NB without pushing or forcing) you should hear the high tones of your false voice, or Falsetto.

While falsetto is kind of mariah carey voice at the begining of the \u201ci\u2019ll be there\u201d song and you can\u2019t singing falsetto louder. If you want to learn falsetto, just imitate Mariah Carey in the jackson 5 song. But you\u2019d better just singing in headvoice, its better than falsetto. ",
