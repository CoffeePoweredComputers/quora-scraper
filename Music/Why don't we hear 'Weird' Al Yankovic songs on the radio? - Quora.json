            "answer_text": "My educated guess is that the way that comedy works for most people is quite different from the formula that radio stations typically use to program music. My dad once said of Airplane!, that film is hilarious the first time you watch it, but if you watch it a second time, it becomes predictable and stupid because all of the funny surprises have been ruined. Radio station playlists use controlled amounts of repetition to create a sound that is familiar and comforting to the listener. There are hardcore fans of \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic and other comedy musicians who can find pleasure in the music, even if they listen to the songs over and over. However, most people would quickly burn out on comedy songs if a radio station put them into heavy rotation. Barry Hansen, better known by his on-air name, Dr. Demento, had a syndicated radio show that catered to fans of comedy songs. By nature, this show appealed to a niche audience. As competition between stations heated up and programming became \u201ctighter,\u201d The Dr. Demento Show was given the boot at many affiliate stations. At the beginning of the 21st century, Hansen\u2019s syndicator dropped the program, and Hansen started a company to continue syndication to the few remaining affiliates. That was a money-losing proposition, so Hansen re-launched the show as a paid subscription Website. At one time many radio stations had morning show teams that might have played goofy parody songs like those by \u201cWeird Al.\u201d Due to budget cuts, many radio stations have seriously cut back on their use of DJs (if they have them at all), and goofy songs don\u2019t work as well when the personality of the DJ can\u2019t bounce off of them or provide some context (at least in my opinion).

            "answer_text": "Why don't we hear \"Weird\" Al Yankovic songs on the radio? The short answer to that is because most of his songs are paradies. And unless he has covered artists who are or were absolutely huge in culture in the moment, it is hard pressed to get most of his songs on the radio. Lets look at his only 3 hits to make the Top 40: White & Nerdy, a parody of Artist: Chamillionaire's Ridin' Dirty. His promotion of the very parody made it \u201cWeird Al's\u201d only song to make it into the Top 10.Eat it. (Became a hit because of Michael Jackson's blessing. Made it to #12.Smell's Like Nirvana! An obvious parody about no one being able to understand the band's lyrics! Chart #37.(Runner up) Like A Surgeon. A song in which Madonna herself asked him to write. It made thr Top 50.Now, as you can see, either these artists were massively famous, or such as the one withChamillionaire's promotion of his song. it did well! ",
