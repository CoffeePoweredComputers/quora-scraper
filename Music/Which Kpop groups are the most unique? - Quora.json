On stage and on interviews they are so inspiring and motivating, but when you watch Run BTS they are extremely relatable and are complete Crackheads. They lesson their music gives is beautiful, I got into BTS due to love yourself , aafter I read some of their song lyrics, I fell in love with them and their music. The way they care about us ARMYs\u2026  BUT THROUGH THOSE LONG DARK NIGHTS, YOU GUYS LIT THE WAY FOR US. SO THOUGH WE MAY BE SMALL, WE WILL STAY WHERE WE ARE, DOING WHAT WE CAN, WHAT WE KNOW HOW TO DO, DOING WHAT WE DO BEST\u2026 AND WE WILL TRY TO LIGHT UP THE WAY FOR YOUR LONG DARK NIGHTS. WE LOVE YOU GUYS. \u2014 RM  And might i add they are handsome. ",

Their music has a Jrock sound to it with heavy instrumentals. They actually initially debuted with a typical cutesy concept but didn\u2019t do very well so they went back to training then redebuted with a few new members and a much darker concept and now we have DreamCatcher.
