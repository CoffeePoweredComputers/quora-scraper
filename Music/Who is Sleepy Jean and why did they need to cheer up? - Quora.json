Instead of turning and running (or messing around with the plumber) she stays faithful\u2026and miserable. The narrator realizes the dream of being \u201chigh school sweethearts\u201d isn't all it's cracked up to be and that his wife is unhappy. Instead of divorcing he tells her to \u201ccheer up\"\u2026because: \u201clife can't always be this bad\u2026can it?\u2026it can?\u2026then we\u2019ll keep turning lemons into lemonade until one or both of us drown.\u201d Cheers.
