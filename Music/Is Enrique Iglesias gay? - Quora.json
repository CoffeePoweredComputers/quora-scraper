            "answer_text": "Well, It's looks like maybe he is. \u2019Cause you know..  Whenever he's with Mr. Worldwide, he is just simply all into him :p :3  And maybe this could be the reason why he isn't sure where his relationship with his girl Anna should go.  Soo.. Is he really gay? Or it's just appears that he is? Well IMO, he is the most hottest guy alive and hence no wonder that I\u2019m a Enriquette and answering this question. And as far the question goes about his sexuality goes, he is as straight as the ray of light and yes we all know at times the light even bends just like Enrique falls for Pitbull :p :p Nevertheless they both are bffs goals and the thing about his girlfriend Anna whom he\u2019s dating since 2001, well he has said it in many interviews that he like it better this way, is the most important person to him and he loves her unconditionally . after his fans ofc :p  Xoxo ^_^ Update ~ Turns out he was actually kidding with Anna :p  I\u2019m so effing on the cloud 9. Finally all rumors end. Twins! Twins! Twinssss!! Enrique\u2019s a father now. God, I need more oxygen today! ;-; ",

            "answer_text": "No Enrique Iglesias is not gay at all instead he is in a relationship with Anna kournikova for the last 16 years and also have children. And kissing Mr Worldwide may be due to the affection and frankness with him and doesn't mean that he is homosexual and ad we all know that many a times the celebrities and other people kiss, hug and hold the person of their same gender but this dosnt mean that they all are gay or homosexual . Because we all know kissing and all these are the way of showing love and many a times we do it for fun. And the most important thing is that as we have seen his videos and songs and he has kissed and have performed various intimate scenes with a number of females which is enough to certify that he is not gay.
