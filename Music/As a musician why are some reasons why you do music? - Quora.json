            "answer_text": "My dear departed mother, Eileen, was a proficient sight-reading pianist and played majestic classical works on the piano, regularly, in addition to the modern standards of the day. Even though I was a very young boy, those great classical pieces really moved me and touched me emotionally, accordingly, I was hooked in a very natural and organic way, at an early age. I just absolutely loved music, I found it spiritual, and coupled with my love for astronomy, I felt connected to the universe(s), so it kind of became my religion, if you will. So, to coin a cliche: \u2018It\u2019s in my blood\u2019. By the age of 8 my parents bought me my first guitar, and by the age of 10 I had learned how to play it. Then I heard The Beatles, who inspired me to compose my own songs and music, as did millions of others! At that point I learned how to play piano so that I could use both guitar and keyboard to assist me with my songwriting, the latter of which has proven to be an extremely therapeutic activity for me over the years. By the time I was 14, I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been writing, recording and performing music ever since. You could say it\u2019s an addiction, since, metaphorically speaking, to me, music is by far the best \u2018drug\u2019 ever! I also find the creative process to be a form of meditation, since I very often find myself in a trance-like state, where all life\u2019s problems appear to fade away. Suffice to say I have an overactive mind, also a lot of demons and musical creativity, being a cathartic process - really helps me to exorcise them. Over the decades, the music industry has changed so much since I started out - giving me a whole host of very good reasons to hang it up - but try as as I might, I just cannot bring myself to quit. Ultimately, I believe - as some experts suggest - that there\u2019s an energy-field surrounding our bodies, from which we draw in ideas that are then processed in our respective brains. If this is eventually proven to be true, when it comes to creating songs, music, art and such, none of us may really be in that metaphorical driving seat as much as we like to think we are. We might feel we have our hands on that proverbial steering wheel occasionally, but since we don\u2019t completely understand the complex and mysterious mechanisms of the creative process, I honestly feel that some external universal force could very likely be driving US. But whatever the definitive answer to this turns out to be, it\u2019s fair to say - that in my case - the music really, truly, IS, in my blood. ",

            "answer_text": "For me personally, music has always been my spiritual connection, my personal form of prayer, not from a particular religion but as a way of being totally inclusive and open to all that is good. If I don't have that connection then it's very hard for me to play. I play two instruments, the drum set, which I feel is a public instrument which takes part in music with others for others, bringing joy to an audience, and I also play the Native American flute which is more contemplative and inward. I perform with that for yoga classes, libraries, senior centers etc. and occasionally with other instruments in a more public setting, but in the end, drums are outward, flute is inward for me, and whatever I play, it has to have a prayer like element for me. Which doesn't always happen, especially w drums because the music drums are used in is more ego based to me, but I aim for the heavens every time I play, no matter what or who I'm playing with. ",

            "answer_text": "ORIGINAL QUESTION: As a musician why are some reasons why you do music? Because I enjoy it. In years past, it also provided a substantial income. But making decent money by playing locally is pretty much a thing of the past. Nowadays it\u2019s international superstar or nothing. That\u2019s a shame, because there are many very talented musicians who would be glad to play evenings or weekends if they could make anything from doing so. Not too many people past the age of twenty or so can afford to tour endlessly, working for peanuts in the hope that someday, somehow they might become fabulously wealthy. That\u2019s just not realistic for most people. So, nowadays, I just play occasionally at home. I am cooking up a new project, hopefully to be completed soon. So stay tuned! ",

            "answer_text": "When I started learning I did it because of the attention I got from people when I was performing. I was a show off as a kid and I enjoyed people telling me how good I was. That was the best form of motivation for me. That all changed when I played at a club for the first time. There was alcohol, women and people cheering. As a 15 year old that was seductive enough, but I got paid the princely sum of $50. At the time that was a lot of money. After doing some quick calculations I realised I could make a living out of this. That was the moment that made me put my dreams of being an electrician on the back burner and choose music as a career. So adulation and a career where my motivations. When you write it down it seems pretty shallow. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "To ease certain memories of the pain of living. Because it comes naturally to me. Always has, at least since the age of 5 or earlier. Nobody but nobody on my mother\u2019s or my dad\u2019s side played an instrument but, for me, it was eventually playing a musical instrument or choosing not to live. I guess it is an innate part of my \u201cbiological make-up\u201d? I LOVE dancing \u2014 if a song I really like is playing in store I am in, I have to leave the store because I can\u2019t stop myself from dancing in the store. Playing music is like dancing, but on an instrument of your choice. I compose songs, melody and lyrics. Creating music is an outlet for my creative nature. ",

Back then I did it cuz I was a shy guy but playing music and standing behind a guitar kind of gave me confidence and made me comfortable. I played music for a living for many years because I wanted to travel and see the country. I wanted to earn a living while I was doing that and so I did. I loved playing music, seeing new cities, meeting new people experiencing different crowd personalities. Now I play music because I love recording, I love being creative, I loved composing new songs and studying people's reactions to those songs. Music soothes my soul and it always has. It may sound corny but it always has. ",
