            "answer_text": "Because for that tune, they sampled the undeniably seminal disco track, 'Good Times' by the genius that is Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards AKA Chic. Rap anything over Bernard's bassline in that track and you've got yourself a monster hit. That's what those two cats, and in particular Nile did - make hits. That's why Nile's guitar (the same Stratocaster he's been running since the Chic days) is aptly named 'The Hitmaker'.  Sugarhill Gang just sprinkled a bit of contemporary icing on what was already a phenominally catchy and commercially successful cake. You've gotta give it up to them however, for being one of the first acts to bring rap (or hip hop) vocals into the mainstream domain; and this is another reason that the song was such a success - most of the mainstream hadn't heard rap before, and it was a genre organically grown from the streets, the blueprint for many genres to come. Groundbreaking stuff :-) ",

            "answer_text": "As Harry Wolfman stated, the 'Good Times' sample is so infectious that it demands your attention. At the time, mainstream had never heard of this new phenomenon called Hip-Hop which produced the genre of music called Rap. Until these two elements came together, Hip-Hop was just an underground culture that could only be found at parties and park jams. All of a sudden, this invisible, underground culture is on pop culture's radar and it's just the beginning of what will become the world's fascination with Urban culture. ",
