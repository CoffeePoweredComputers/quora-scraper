If the policies do not allow it, you should consider whether your use might be Fair Use as parody or as commentary or critique. If it is none of these, you will need to get licensing from the publisher and record label. ",

Meaning BTS and have the title of the song. That goes with any publication even if it is not on YouTube. Hope that helps. ",
