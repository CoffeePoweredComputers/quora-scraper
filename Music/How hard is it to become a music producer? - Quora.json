            "answer_text": "From my personal experience: Anyone can produce music. But to be a successful one is a different story. It takes years to know what sounds good to people. What will be a \u201chit\u201d Start off being an intern/volunteer at a studio for a while. They will have you cleaning the floors and mowing. Do that for a few months\u2026 Then they will ask you to take over on protools sessions cause they are too busy or don\u2019t want to do it. Yay, at least it\u2019s what you went to school for! By now it\u2019s been a year or two and they decide to give you a paying job. Assistant engineering is almost harder than lead engineer position because you get there before everyone and you leave after everyone. You have all the documentation and setup and tear down. It\u2019s a pain but you love it for some reason. Do that for a few years. You have been doing your own sessions for a while and you get the title of lead engineer. You still aren\u2019t producer yet however, if a band comes in and they ask your opinion and you give it, you are producing at that point. But be careful, you never know what kind of things the band might say behind your back. If you give a suggestion and they are not successful, you may be in trouble with your career. Producer is someone that gets hired to call the shots. Someone the artist trusts to make the right decisions. It\u2019s a wildly exaggerated position that kids claim they are but they really have no idea. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very easy to become a music producer, as it\u2019s not a protected title, and pretty much anyone with a DAW/Music program can call themselves a producer. But a successful one? Very hard. For the above reason, there are INSANE amounts of people who wants to become producers. A lot want to do it for fame and money, and most of them fail for this reason. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work. Sprinkled with talent if you want to make a living from it as well. I never thought I would possibly be patient enough to spend 10 000 hours on anything in my life, but with music production, I think I can. I have probably spent 1\u20132000 hours over the last 3 years or so already. A few hours a day. Everything from composing and messing around, to being active in relevant Facebook groups, to watching youtube tutorials to reading blogs, and analyzing music. Still not really making money on it, but I am confident it will come soon. ",
