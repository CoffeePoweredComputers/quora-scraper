            "answer_text": "I would trust the guy working there. The last thing he wants is for someone to go in there saying \u201c hey you set up my guitar all f-d up !\u201d really loud. He would lose his job. Now if it\u2019s set up a way you don\u2019 t like and you didn\u2019t tell him how you like it set up and just let him do it , then don\u2019 texpect it to be how you like it . It will be how he likes it. This is your fault. You can tell him how you like it, action, low, etc. Worried more about the intonation, etc. ",

Do some due diligence before committing to taking it in for set-up. Setting up an electric guitar is not rocket science. Setting up an acoustic guitar requires some more involved luthier skills. ",
