            "answer_text": "does STRAY KIDS count as roookies now? lmao idk but i definitely know that they are worth stanning. their age range is from 23 years old to 19.    debute date: 25 march 2018 fandom name: STAY originally there were 9 members but the oldest kim woojin left the group due to some personal reasons last year in october, so we have 8 now. their first pre debute song is Hellevator[1] their debute song is District 9[2] their latest comeback title track is Levanter[3] this is the song that made me stan Victory Song [4] some people say that their songs are too \u201cnoisy\u201d so i would like u to check out these songs too: M.I.A[5]Grow Up[6]Sunshine[7] (written by han jisung\ud83e\udd7a)I am You[8] (close to my heart and its ballad version hits me)VERY honourable mention~ 3RACHA   3RACHA is actually a pre-debut hiphop group consisting of three members of stray kids Bangchan (leader) Han jisung, Changbin. they are basically the producing unit of stray kids. Warning: they spit fire (thats why they are called 3racha LMFAO IM SORRY) all three of them are rappers not only producing they also write, arrange, compose their own songs! my favourite 3racha song is Runner's High[9] they are different. give them a chance! im sure they wont disappoint u.
