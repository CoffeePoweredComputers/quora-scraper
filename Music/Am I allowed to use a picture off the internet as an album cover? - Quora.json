            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes- with permission. Longer answer - any picture you find on the internet, could easily be recreated with enough changes to classify it as a separate work of art. But if you\u2019re dead set on using a specific image you must get permission from the original owner of the image - either by purchasing the rights to use, purchasing rights in full ownership or obtaining permission to use - but you should be careful to have great documentation of all of this. Finding the original owner is important - you may find an image posted somewhere but it may have been posted by someone else who simply found it - always inquire to the authenticity of ownership and verify through additional image searches. The exception to This being if the image is clearly marked as being public domain - or royalty free. There are websites specifically for obtaining images royalty free or purchasing rights to use images. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no, unless you receive written permission from the company. I worked in marketing for a large company many years ago in promotions. We were developing several programs over a span of time which involved us giving away products or awards from other major companies (Campbells Soup, Lego, Chevrolet, Dunkin Doughnuts , and some others). I contacted all through various channels and had to describe through visuals and writing what are intent was ( mostly giving away their products which we purchased). All were very courteous and set boundaries as to what we could do and in the end granted us permission. Given the legal implications, it is always best to seek permission. ",

            "answer_text": "There are sites which offer free-use photos, which means you can use the photos free and clear and you don\u2019t need to attribute anybody (one such site is Wikimedia Commons). Outside of the website telling you the photo is free to use, you have to make sure you\u2019re allowed to use the photo to avoid any possible copyright infringement. There are also sites, like shutterstock.com, that sell photos. Some search engines have filters which enable you to show you images that are free to use and share. Here\u2019s a sample search at Google, for instance. \u201cLabeled for reuse\u201d would be the one to pick if you\u2019re looking for free-to-use photos. Different search engines have different filter menus.  Even in these cases, it might be a good idea to make sure you can use the photo, if you can. ",
