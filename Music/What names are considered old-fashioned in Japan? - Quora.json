            "answer_text": "Very old fashioned? I would think that just about any extended generation Japanese American who has a Japanese middle name would fit the bill, as we often are named after our great grandparents or people in that past generation. As a side note, Japanese Americans in Hawaii sometimes add an extra \u201cy\u201d into romanizations of names, something which is absent in modern Japanese. Names like Inoue, Maeda, and Chieko for example sometimes are transcribed as Inouye, Mayeda, and Chiyeko. If I see a name written in such a way, I immediately know said person is a Japanese American from that generation. Anyhow, here\u2019s a short list of common names among Japanese Americans that are relatively old fashioned in the proverbial \u201cmotherland.\u201d Anything with a \u201cko.\u201d KeikoAikoToyokoSachikoKimikoAnything with a \u201cro.\u201d JiroTaroIchiroOther random mentions: HiroshiGihachi (Eldest cousin named this after great grandfather. Name means \u201ceight ceremonies, \u5100\u516b.)Tsugio and probably most names ending in \u201c-o.\u201dMasahiroHirokoAnd many, many more. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me introduce you to the custom \u8972\u540d (shu-mei/succession of names) in Japan. Apart from the \u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u5f79\u8005(kabuki actors) name succession, we have a custom to succeed names along with the leadership position of family owned businesses. For example, from my home town, there is a brewery that started in 1690, that has a tradition to succeed the first name \u4e09\u592a\u592b (san da yu) who started the business. \u6df1\u7530\u4e09\u592a\u592b is the full name. Also in my home town there is a \u5473\u564c (miso) company that was started by \u65e9\u5ddd\u4e45\u53f3\u885b\u9580 (Kyu emon Hayakawa) in 1560. The president of the company succeeds the full name. The present president is the 19th generation \u65e9\u5ddd\u4e45\u53f3\u885b\u9580. For both cases, the successor officially alters his family registry at the municipal administration. I\u2019m quite sure there are many more similar cases in Japan. These first names are definitely old fashion. ",
