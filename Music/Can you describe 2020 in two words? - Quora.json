            "answer_text": "Will , I can definitely describe 2020 with two words. Let me tell you two words : Reality Nightmares. The pandemic made many people suffer badly not only the poor but also the rich people. The corona virus (CONVID-19 ) which started in September 2019 now struck the earth with chaos and panic which can cause death in the lungs. The rich may or may not be affected but the poor have to endure the most when the world's people is 36 percent living in extreme poverty and still continuously rising. Climate change is one thing , government problems are one thing and now the Corona Virus. It really hard to adapt for the poor , one mess is already difficult enough but at this rate the stakes are getting higher for the poor people. But let\u2019s not get our hopes down because the matters will only get worse. Food Donations and medical supplies are being donated not only the poor but also the countries. We must not look down on Chinese people because they are the one who aids countries with bountiful masks and beds. Countries helps each other. This is not the time to fail or give up but think of it as a test from god , the ability to withstand the virus , how can we survive ? how can we encounter with this disease and how can we fight this pandemic but do not let fear or death control you. Most importantly do not get your hope and dreams to vanish. One of my relative died not because of Convid-19 but with a heart attack. Even if it\u2019s not because of this pandemic I want you to know rich people can still suffer. Being one of rich people I can tell myself that I\u2019m one of the luckiest person among others because I have food to eat , water to drink and a shelter to stay comfortably in and being able to attend a school which many people can\u2019t get hold of these 3 things. My mom and grandma always tell me that do not waste water, electricity and money and to eat every single grain of rice from a plate and to cherish good memories with your loved ones because you will never know when they will go and perish from your life, however that moments I did not listen but now able to have all these things made me realize you are lucky if you have food, shelter and to properly attend a school. YOU MUST REALIZE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE . There are many people below you who doesn\u2019t have these kinds of things . Not all the rich people will stay rich not will all the poor stay poor the whole life. That\u2019s called life. Life throws tantrums at you and yes that is called life. Once again, This is not a time to give up or fail , but think of it as a test from god, testing you ability to fight this disease, your choices. Think about how we can survive ? how can we encounter the virus? Do not get your hopes down but do not let death, fear and panic control what you are during this time. Most Importantly : \u201c WASH YOUR HANDS !\u201d (Thanks for reading !) :) ",

            "answer_text": "Disappointing ans upsetting. Disappointing as now we see daily, on a worldwide scale, how little people actually care about eachother and prioritize their own selfishness. Take for example, all these people refusing to wear masks just because they believe it's an infringement upon their freedom. Does it not ever occur to them that they could drastically impact the life of someone else? Does it not ever pass their mind that they could pass on a disease that could kill the loved grandparent of a close knit family? Just because it doesn't seem likely that they themselves will get sick, all they care about is their own selfish self. They will willingly sacrifice the lives of others just for the sake of their own \u201cfreedom\". Another selfish fact about these people; because of them, covid is more difficult to get under control. Borders are being closed thanks to these people, who not only flaunt not wearing masks or social distancing, but whom also trespass into other countries just to sightsee, while families and loved ones are separated from eachother, waiting, praying for the day that they get to be reunited. All those people \u201cpassing\" Canada to go into alaska just to sightsee, waving around the fact that they have found a \u201cloophole\" in the rules and regulations just makes it so much harder for people who actually care about others and following rules. It's so completely self centered and ignorant that for me personally, it's hard to wrap my mind around it. I'm an essential worker, working full time in a retail store. Right now, in Honolulu, we have a stay at home order till Friday as our cases have increased. What do we see here? Our store is packed. Really, no one besides the employees are distancing. People wear their masks so wrongly it's amazing how they're functioning as adults. And I'm sorry. But is a 30 pack of beer and lays potato chips really essential? Because of these people who flaunt their obvious disregard for rules, people like my friends and I (who are trying hard to stay safe) are being put at risk and punished for the bad behavior of others. When not working, I stay at home. I purchase groceries at work, go home, and stay put till the next day of work. I don't go to parties. I don't go out. I always wear a mask. I social distance myself further than recommended. And yet, I am being punished, again, for the bad behavior of others. I am one of millions who are separated by the closure of the borders from the one person I love more than anything in this world. I haven't seen him for months, and it's been the hardest thing, just because some selfish egotistical people don't care or think they're invincible. I apologise for the rant and long read; I'm actually really upset. ",
