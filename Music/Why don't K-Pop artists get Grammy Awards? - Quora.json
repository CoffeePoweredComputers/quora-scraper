I predict the next Grammy Awards will see BTS nominated, at the very least\u2026. EDIT: Some \u2018experts\u2019 claim that it won\u2019t happen because the Grammy\u2019s are exclusive and snooty towards boybands, citing Bieber & One Direction. Well, Bieber I fully understand LOL Not sure about the other group (ie whether they really wrote their own stuff, etc).But BTS does indeed write most of their own music and creates their own concepts, as do several other KPop groups now.
