            "answer_text": "When Biden said he believed in \u201cLaw and order with justice.\u201dWhen Biden said his climate change plan was not the same as the Green New Deal.When Biden said that violence was different from peaceful protests.When Biden said re-imagining the police meant more money to train and support the police in doing things better, like sending a mental health specialist to scenes were they could help which would reduce the need for force. (Paraphrase)When Biden pointed out that many good officers comdemned Floyd\u2019s murder and other such murders and wanted such officers to be held accountable.Biden said he would abide by the election results. Trump did not say that, just as he refused to do so in 2016. (He doesn\u2019t believe in the US or the Constitution, that is clear. He is not a patriot - doesn\u2019t care about US law, rights, or the people.)Trump was right about Biden being part of the decision in the 90s that resulted in mass incarceration of many people, including a too-high percentage of black people, mostly young black men. Of course, most of us know that black people were more in support of those changes than white people. But it was a bad decision. I wish it had been a real debate, and in a real debate, I would have liked Biden to have said he regretted that. But it wasn\u2019t a real debate. I remember real debates from a couple or more decades ago when it was dry, yet the people could actually speak.I would never vote for Trump, but was quite reluctant on Biden until tonight. I\u2019m more enthused about Biden now. Regarding the vote-by-mail, my son says there ARE cases where mail-in votes were found in the trash. Biden said that Trump\u2019s own agencies said there was no evidence of fraud or misconduct. I will be looking into it. Overall, the debate was largely a joke. I can\u2019t believe our country has devolved to the point where this sort of \u201cdebate\u201d is part of how we choose our presidents. The old debates seemed \u201cboring\u201d to me with my young mind, but at least we got much more substance out of it, and respect of the two candidates towards one another. The Republicans destroyed respect towards one\u2019s opponents when Obama (who I didn\u2019t like) was elected and the Republicans vowed to opposed every single thing he did - right or wrong. They started this disrespect and hate running through politics. ",
