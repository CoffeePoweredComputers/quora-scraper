            "answer_text": "Your father is right, but what he is saying is very difficult to put into wordsA melody is more than a string of notes.  A rough comparison might be to hear several actors reciting some lines from Shakespeare. The words will be identical but the phrasing, emphasis, and intonation will be different. It will sound natural, flowing,  and convincing by some yet forced and and erratic by othersThis is to say that a 'melody' as written is a guide to the performance, and the composer of the melody may well have a different idea to how the melody will be played to how the performer will play it.What is more,   a composer of a melody may not be the person to interpet it the best as many composers are not particularly good musicians The most performed musical sequence is the 'Blues', and it is the basis for thousands of melodiesIt has a very simple chord sequence, and can easily be sung over and improvised on, yet the ability to construct a good melody line is extremely difficult. In music, you have composers, arrangers, and performers. They are rarely the same personLionel Bart, a successful composer  would whistle his tunes for someone else to write downYehudi Menuhin declared his amazement that jazz players could create improvised melodies on chord sequences they had not previously heard Though one can learn to create melodies, one can also get a computer to do the same by feeding it a chord sequence. But a melody has to make musical sense, and defining 'musical sense' is not something that can be defined by words. Obviously someone brought up in a musical environment and exposed to music regularly will develope an ear for music, but not necessarily an ear for melody. I think your father is correct in saying that though the craft of music may be taught, creating a melody line that makes musical sense is very much a gift. ",

            "answer_text": "It can only be learnt, but how easily it is learnt is very different from person to person. There are all sorts of factors why that I won't get into (genes, musical upbringing, way of listening etc.). First we have to ask \"What is a good melody?\" and realise that the answer is very different depending on the style you are aiming for. Different styles have different idioms that are used, often subconsciously, by the composer, and a good melody in one style can be a bad melody in another. Then we have to consider that a melody can sound good or bad depending on the interpretation. I'd say that any series of notes can evoke great emotion (if that is the goal) if interpreted and arranged in a way that the listeners can appreciate. This also varies wildly between styles. In order to compose with a melody, the composer must often interpret their own melody. There are concrete ways of learning how to write melodies, other than just listening and playing. One is to study other melodies by masters of the style you are aiming for, preferably with some kind of learning material. Another important thing to consider is form (or \"the morphology of the continuity\" if you like Cage) which is a big feature of melodies in most genres. Of course, you also need to know about harmony, the target instrument for the melody etc. There is much to consider and many ways to get there, but if you break it down, these are all things that can be learnt and put together. Lastly, what is a good melody? No one agrees. I'd say Beethoven generally wrote quite poor melodies, but he none the less composed some great music. It's all a matter of taste. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Melody\" is not really a skill in most senses of the word. Others here have answered your question with the assumption that you meant to say \"perfect pitch,\" but just for the sake of argument I'm going to assume that you actually did mean to say \"melody.\"  \"Melody\" is simply a sequence of notes in succession which together form an identifiable musical phrase or passage. In a song, the words generally follow the melody. In an ensemble piece, it will often be traded between instruments and harmonized by the accompaniment.  To \"learn\" melody would mean, I imagine, learning to create it through composition. Having tried and failed to write music myself I can vouch for the fact that composition is deadly difficult, and coming up without a worthwhile melody to work from, the piece is basically dead on arrival. But is it an inherent skill? Possibly. Melodies don't come to me at all, but my wife thinks of them all the time. That said, I suspect a strong grounding in music theory, and a study of music from the perspective of a composer rather than that of a listener, would probably help push you into the realm of melody-creation. So I think that's what your dad is getting at: you can't teach it, but with enough determination, you can probably learn it. ",

Your dad's opinion is a prevalent one because we barely understand how music works at all, much less how people learn to make it, or why some people are better at it than others. But learn it we do. I have good insight into this because my music education happened very slowly, so I was a fully introspective adult for a lot of the really significant parts of it. I watched myself go from a complete naif with okay instincts to a sophisticated but uneven producer to my present level of more-or-less effortless mastery. It took me a very long time, and I'm still learning. I can point to certain experiences, certain people, certain books, and say, I learned this sub-skill from this source. But even for me, most of the process remains mysterious. ",

There are various musical traditions around the world, like in Africa, the Middle and Far East that have unique sounds and rhythms and spacings of frequencies (\"notes\") compared to western music. If you listen to these musics, you find them very strange and maybe not even pleasant because of the fact that you're immersed in a culture of music already. The skills to create and repeat \"melody\" as we know it come from being a part of the hermeneutic of western music. In a sense, your dad is right. But, as one is immersed in this tradition, there has to be some active listening in order to start to intuit the patterns. There was a time when I couldn't do jazz melody and/or improvisation. But I hit the tunes, listening to new things, learning the songs, internalizing, moving on to another. You definitely can't learn note-by-note. ",
