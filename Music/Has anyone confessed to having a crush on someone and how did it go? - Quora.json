            "answer_text": "I have confessed to my crush on October 22 , 2011 and it was by Facebook. We were 16 years old at the time and I told her that I had a huge crush on her and that she was the reason I woke up in the morning. That she was very beautiful when she walked past me. She responded with: Awwww. That\u2019s very sweet of you and I am flattered. But just know that you need to let it pass. We don\u2019t know each other. I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I was like: Sounds good. But I was really down in the dumps after that last message. I cried for like 2 hours and was very heartbroken because that\u2019s what a crush is supposed to do. Crush that infatuation and get you back in reality. Next day, she gave me space to move on from that crush feeling. She didn\u2019t talk to me for 3 weeks. Then she talked to me after Thanksgiving break. She told me if I was all good and I was like: Yes, I am good now. So weeks pass and Winter Break came. During those days, I would miss her a lot. I wanted to be with her. But I kept it buried and distracted myself by going on Zombies with my friends online because I was a nerd back then. All those days I spent on Video Games, Going outside and etc. So January 9th, 2012, I came back and saw her again. I did blush a little bit but I shook it off because I wanted to be strong and not show it even though deep down, I did want to show it. But then, things started happening, she started to kinda act a little off when she around me. She would play with her hair and look at me and then when I looked, she turned the other way. I was very confused. She kept doing that for like 4 days. Fast forward to January 19th, in the last class of the day. She entered the classroom and sat down as usual. She had her group and I had mines. Of course I did my work, listened to music in my headphones as usual. Then I looked all over the classroom and see what everyone was doing, that\u2019s when I noticed her looking at me and blushing. She told literally 5 of her friends about me and all of them started giving me looks. In my head, I was like: What is going on? So I started to kinda figure out what was going on these past weeks. I started to realize that she had a crush on me. Once I knew, I was happy and kept it to myself. January 20th 2012, she came in class and she was dolled up all the way. She had a red dress on and wore red lipstick and mascara. I was damnnn, she must be in love with me. On that day, it was a test. So I had to focus on it. But she was literally looking at me and then back at the test. After the test was done, she wanted my attention and I looked at her. She started to confess that she was in love with me and told me how she felt around me. I was so happy. I was speechless. Just so many feelings at one time. I responded: I have feelings for you too. I tried to keep my feelings in check but I coudn\u2019t stop thinking about you. I caressed her face and she kissed me on the cheek. I had red lipstick on my left face cheek. Then the bell rang and I walked her to the next class. Later on, we hung out in the last class and walked home together, holding hands and talking to each other. We couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other. I was sprung as fuck hahah. We then went on 3 to 4 dates. It was fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Ahem ahem\u2026okay here we go! In total I\u2019ve confessed twice to my crushes. Luckily, both went pretty well. But, the struggle is real! Okay, the first one. So I was in love with this guy for a while. He was my best friend. I wanted to tell him but I was so scared! Naah, I\u2019m not afraid of rejection. But, the fact that once he gets to know, things won\u2019t ever be the same\u2026.that\u2019s what was my fear. He kind of sensed something fishy. I had told him that I had a crush on a guy but I didn\u2019t tell him the name. And somehow, he realized it was him. So once we were hanging out together and he randomly asked Him - \u201cHey, you had a crush on someone right?\u201d Me (all awkward) - \u201cYeah\u201d Him - \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d At that moment I had two choices, either to tell him or let it go. I had been keeping it to myself for long, really long. So, I took a deep breath and said Me - \u201cIt\u2019s you\u201d Him (Blank) - \u201cWhat?\u201d Me - \u201cI love you. You don\u2019t need to love me back. It\u2019s fine. I just wanted you to know how I feel. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect our friendship in any way\u201d Him - \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything. It was so awkward. Then we went home and I received a text from him. Him - \u201cI love you too!\u201d Oh my god! Trust me, I was dead! I was in love with him since long before I myself knew about it and him feeling the same was one of the best things ever. It was so unexpected! I never knew these simple words from the right person would feel so good. We dated for a while and later broke up. That\u2019s an another story. Currently, we still are best friends.  The second one. So I had a random crush on this guy, nothing serious. I told my best friend about it. Oh my god, she was so excited about it! Never ever tell your best friend about your crush! NEVER! Lol. So she literally begged me to tell him. I wasn\u2019t even sure about how I felt. And here I was, all alone standing in front of him stuck in this awkward situation. All thanks to her! Him - \u201cShe told me you had to tell something\u201d Me - \u201cUmmm\u201d Her - \u201cIt\u2019s really important. Tell him quick!\u201d Me - \u201cWill you shut up, ever?\u201d Him - \u201cYeah I\u2019m here, tell me.\u201d Me - \u201cUmmmmmm\u201d Her - \u201cOMG, will you?\u201d Him - \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Her - \u201cTell him!\u201d Ugghhh\u2026.That was a lot of pressure to handle! Me - \u201cOkay, here it is. I think I like you\u201d (Seriously? \u201cThink\u201d) Him - \u2026\u2026. Why do guys go blank? It\u2019s so annoying! Her - \u201cSay something\u201d Him - \u201cYou know, Mansi I like you too but\u2026\u201d Aaah here we go! My first ever rejection! Her - \u201cBut?\u201d Him - \u201cCan I talk to her alone?\u201d Her - \u201cUggh Okay\u201d And here we were alone. Him - \u201cMansi, You\u2019re an amazing girl and before saying anything I\u2019d want to know you more. We aren\u2019t close enough. I don\u2019t want to jump into anything before getting to know you.\u201d Me - \u201cHmm\u2026fair enough\u201d And then we started talking more and became really good friends. We used to talk every single day about nothing and everything. He eventually started to have feelings for me but by then I wasn\u2019t into him and thus we decided to stay friends. A year later he got into a relationship with another girl. At that point I realized that I kind of still had feelings for him, but it was too late now. That\u2019s an another story. Now, we don\u2019t talk anymore.  So according to me, both went pretty well. What matters is that at least I have no regrets. Telling someone how you feel is one of the hardest things ever. And no matter how many times you\u2019ve done it before, its always is hard. But, what I personally believe is that a little embarrassment is much better than a lifetime of regret. There is a time for silence. And there is a time to wait for your turn. But, if you know how you feel and you\u2019re sure you want it then I don\u2019t think you should ever hold back. The words that you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest. So, Speak now! ",

It was 1st January, 2017 (My birthday) and I really wanted to make this day even special. Before this I thought to confess her many times but waited for the perfect day and there it was.. Here's how it goes..    Thanks for watching! :) Ignore grammar mistakes! Edit 1: Thanks for upvotes lovely people! There are a few comments asking what was her reply. I can't share the screenshot as I had saved my part only and since my phone changed, I don't have the older chats. Her reply was that she was committed since last 3\u20134 years or so. She felt nice that I had confessed this to her and didn't expected anything in return. She also appreciated by saying it needs courage to tell someone about their feelings. She told me I'm a nice human being and a good friend of her. I shall get someone better than her in near future. It's been more than 1.5 years. We, after this became good friends, we got placed in the same company. Having a colleague like her was best experience of lifetime. She left the organization 4 months back and got engaged to the same person she loved. I was very happy to know this. She's getting married in 2019. We are still in touch and keep sharing things like we used to! There's nothing like heartbroken feeling. We get over to things and people. Just it takes little time. Post this, I managed to be in a relationship which didn't work well. I also confessed my feelings with another girl who was my junior. Now? Waiting for next! :p ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! It's embarrassing, but it's fucking working. Sit down, children, and you shall hear the most awkward story of Paul Revere. So, here I am with my best friend in my freshman year of high school. For convenience, let's call her Karen. Our school has two sets of stairs near the left side of the campus, one set coming down from the main gym, the second coming off of a small exit right next to the gym. We would sit on the second set of stairs, because it has the best view of the campus's relatively forested inner landscape. It was rather beautiful, but we didn't keep it for long. The next week, a sophomore couple making out took our spot. We were slightly annoyed and yelled \"get a room!\" jokingly. The girl, let's call her Julia, and the guy, let's call him David, both turned to us. Julia had a permanent snooty look on her face, and accordingly sneered at us. David gave us a blank, yet focused look. He was very handsome, though. He was a dirty blonde rugby jock who I had seen a lot around. Deep, piercing blue eyes, the cutest freckles, slightly pointed canines like a sexy wolverine, with a perfect swimmer's build. Sweat-inducing description aside, the next day, they weren't there and we took the spot again. They came back later in the period and saw us; David rose his eyebrows slightly and walked on, while Julia gave her characteristic sneer and then narrowed her eyes at us. The next day, they took the larger steps coming out of the main gym for lunch. We had our spot back, so we stopped thinking about David and Julia. Freshman year passed. As eighth-graders, Karen and I had taken French I online, so we were able to be in French II during 9th grade, and now French III during 10th grade. Now, since everyone *had* to take 2 years of a language to graduate, French I and French II were artificially packed with about 30+ people, but French III was 10\u201325, and AP French famously had about 5 students. Our teacher, Madame, now that we had more room for everyone, liked mixing us around regularly. That's when I saw David again\u2014-with a black eye. This is odd, but I didn't think black eyes were *actually* a phenomenon that occurred. I thought that they were primarily something portrayed on television to emphasize eye injuries and abrasions. He didn't try to hide it. Anyway, he was rather quiet and was moved from a table of attractive rugby players to a table of four, containing a nice girl named Angeline, Karen, myself, and David. Mme preferred equal gender division, hence two boys and two girls. We started chatting casually. I assumed he was some blockhead jock, but after some initial awkwardness about his black eye, wherein he explained he ran into an opposing player during some sort of drill, we started talking about the book he was reading. It was some Chomsky tome critiquing American hegemony, and we talked about geopolitical history for the rest of the period. Karen, David, and I quickly became friends, but it was obviously that they were becoming a *bit* closer. I was very jealous, but I, for one, wasn't out and wasn't going to entrust some boy I didn't know very well with my secret, and two, I initially didn't want to be a homebreaker. You might ask why Karen, and I later, didn't mind flirting with a committed guy? Well, here's the detour: Back in their early sophomore year, Julia and David began dating; like many petty high school relationships, it was primarily based on sex. Personality-wise, David found in Julia a sort of wallflower quirkiness with her own fire. Julia found a submissive jock that she could dominate. Yet, as they matured, Julia came out of her shell to emerge as a guilt-inducing dictator. Try as he might, David quickly became emotionally drained from her and subsequently fell out of love. However, she wouldn't let go, using all of her manipulative powers to keep him through guilt. So...he cheated. He cheated with two girls he was relatively close to, some rugby guys, and had a few miscellaneous hookups. You'd think that Julia would be at least a *little* angry, but, in fact, her best friend, Samantha, had started aggressively hitting on her. Julia wasn't bi, but she craved emotional attention since David started glazing over after she showed her true colors. So, Sam took all of Julia's emotional energy, so she only sustained her husk of a relationship with David through guilt and sex. At any rate, Karen and David started moving closer. She started showing me their text conversations, and I resolved myself to squash my jealousy and be a good friend and wingman. There were some problems that they had, though. David wanted a benevolent/playful dom to be his partner. Yet, he made the mistake of choosing simply *quiet* wallflowers, who were secretly abrasive, they just didn't have sufficient social power. Now, I'm really good friends with Karen, but she is too defensive and reliant on others' dominant initiative in a romantic/sexual relationship. They were deeply incompatible, but I was sublimating my feelings for David through Karen, so I put in a little elbow grease. This is the immoral tidbit. I decided to help David \"develop initiative\" and help Karen \"be more benevolently dominant\" by sending each other specific screenshots of my conversations with them. I would get David texts that showed that Karen would immediately respond as soon as he emotionally affirmed her a *little more.* I would show Karen that based on his increased affirmation, he wanted her to respond a bit more \"benevolently dominant.\" They both took the catnip, and they vastly progressed in their relationship, so much so that their love was able to gloss over the fundamental incompatibility. Now, I knew this situation was inherently unsustainable, but I wanted them to get closure with each other first. Anyway, Karen found some screenshots of her as texts on my phone and ratted me out to David. They froze me out, but I still talked to them on an acquaintance basis. Without my stabilizing and catalyzing influence, their romantic/sexual relationship slowly iced over. They didn't really remain friends, but relapsed into civil acquaintances. I decided that I was acting immaturely by staying quiet, so I reached out to them separately, and slowly rebuilt my friendship with both of them. This was at the end of David's senior year, so, with limited time to fix anything, David and Julia utterly fell apart aside from random bouts of sex. They both left for college in different states, and, since then, I've reconnected fully with David. I was still scared to out myself to him, but during early February of this year, we happened to chance upon his gay rugby exploits in conversation, which I hadn't known about beforehand. I weighed the odds, and I decided that there was a negligible chance that he'd reveal my secret if I just told him, so I decided to just be open. It worked out, gladly. He was happy that I was open to him, but he wanted to just be friends. Yet, off and on during texts/calls/Skypes, I sensed that he was open to more. He said that he did have feelings for me, too. Over the next month or so, he flip-flopped between saying he just wanted to be friends and that he had romantic/sexual feelings for me as well whenever I asked him. It was confusing, so over this last week, I asked him in a forthright manner, and he said that he was generally just confused about the nature of his feelings due to his failed relationships, but he did want to start to engage and flirt with me, which I had been doing all along. I've asked him how he knew his feelings were legitimate. He cheated on so many people. Why wouldn't he cheat on me if we did grow closer? He replied by saying that our bond was deeper, more intellectual. He never initiated calls nor texts with anyone else, just using his looks to attract girls and guys to bombard him with offers. I chose to believe that, since I *am* a playful and exuberant andro dom and I am deeply compatible with him in various other ways. He's willing to build an LDR with me, albeit slowly, yet surely. So, that's where we're at. It's late April and my college just happens to be near enough to him so that we can meet in person every month or so. I hope we grow even closer; we have faux serious plans to go to the same grad school, but who knows? --- Also, I have to give *very*, *very*, *very*, *very*, *VERY* strong commendation and thanks to Franklin Veaux for his helpful starter advice on how to sustain a sexual spark in an LDR:  ",

            "answer_text": "No, I never confessed. I did, however, make it very visible. I was his worst nightmare. When I was in the third or second grade, fate assigned my seat next to a blue-eyed, hazel color haired Daniel. He was witty, bubbly, and did a very good job of ignoring my crystal-clear \u201cI like you\u201d hints. Well, they were more than hints. I told my friend group which consisted of three girls from the same class about him. We were a strange combination and our teachers often questioned how we got along: Friend A: quiet, shy, and very considerate of not hurting anyone\u2019s feelings Friend B: rebellious, devilish, and stylish Friend C: quiet, shy, but also not afraid to show her fierce and trouble-maker side And then there was me, the leader of this so-called group of besties. I was neither an angel nor a devil, but the planner of all our deeds. Together, we did the unthinkable. We chased Daniel and his friends during recess hours. We took glee in exhausting them and suddenly jumping away after barely grazing beside them when it was their turn to tag us. Even if their group didn\u2019t want to play, we\u2019d tempt them by poking or questioning their speed. \u201cAre you scared to have a few girls beat you at racing, Daniel,\u201d I\u2019d innocently question. We played tag almost everyday. There were a few or many occasions where I \u201caccidentally\u201d bumped into Daniel or pretended like he bumped into me to have the recess staff call us out and sit down in time-out. I also took it upon myself to bother Daniel in class from passing notes to giving him the \u201cjust marry me and let\u2019s elope to DisneyLand\u201d looks.  I loved any opportunity to sit next to him during movie hours and to nudge him with my elbows. I would wiggle my way around the classroom library area during reading time to sit next to him. He hated it. Daniel was not even spared when I saw him in our neighborhood\u2019s library or the local park. I remember sending my six/seven year old brother to deliver a pink note to Daniel as I looked at him from across the children\u2019s library room. I sat, legs crossed, like a spy agent waiting for my mission to be accomplished. I also remember chasing Daniel alone in the local park until both of us were out of breath. I remember looking back to make sure he noticed how my ponytail danced behind my head as I strut off. Oh, how adorable Daniel looked when his cheeks turned pink. Basically, I was Daniel\u2019s worst nightmare. He knew I liked him, but I never confessed. Why confess when my love was clearly indicative? Why confess when my love was as pure as this? I\u2019m just kidding. I wish I wasn\u2019t such a pest to Daniel even though I was only 8\u20139 years old. I wish I didn\u2019t harass him so much. Had I been in his shoes, my family would\u2019ve discussed the matter in school. Just because he\u2019s a boy doesn't mean that he cannot be harassed by a girl. I feel terrible looking back. I don\u2019t know what happened to Daniel, but his family ended up moving after a year or so. He was placed in a different class after that grade, and so I never interacted with him again. If I could, I\u2019d apologize to Daniel as an adult now. But then again, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he just ran away before I open my mouth to mutter anything. ",

            "answer_text": "For some people, this skill of human interaction comes with ease. For others, it is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest. I would say I belong to the second class of human beings. The attempt to speak out in the presence of other humans is challenging enough for an introvert. But confessing to your crush is something else entirely. It takes up all the courage you have and more often than not, slams you down into the ground. Let us learn about a few incidences in the life of this introvert. It happened during my school years. I was very close to a lady friend of mine. We would do projects together. We would chat about random topics and even participate in competitions together. Of course I had a major crush on her. I decided not to act on it as I knew very well she was dating someone else. After the end of school, we moved on to the field of Engineering. She was single at that time. I confessed that I had a major crush on her and asked her out. She said she wasn\u2019t interested in dating at that moment and friend-zoned me. We continued to be close for an year but suddenly for some reason she severed all contact with me without even letting me know what happened. Maybe she got involved with someone else and didn\u2019t want any connection with me. I never found closure. Of course I wasn\u2019t going to trouble her over this and I moved on. A year later, I met someone else and there was an instant connection - literally so much in common. But I soon found out she was taken too. So I didn\u2019t let her know my feelings. Another year went by and I met another wonderful individual. This time my heart clouded my judgement and I made the gravest mistake of my life. I told her how much I liked her and as fate would have it, she too had a boyfriend. But within a couple of months, she was single again over a trivial reason of long distance relationship (which had worked for her for 4 long years) and she wanted to give it a shot with me. Stupidly, I fell into that trap and thus began the worst couple of years of my life - with constant harassment and physical and mental abuse. After a span of two toxic years I found my freedom and since then I believe my brain is immune to crushes. That does seem far-fetched but that\u2019s what I feel. I haven\u2019t had any crushes in the past two years. It does seem strange when I write about it. Maybe I should get it checked. Any volunteers? ",

            "answer_text": "Yea, but it took me two tries to get myself to say \u201cI like you\u201d. 1st attempt: He was graduating 8th grade and I was in 7th so I decided it was now or never. My friends and I were looking for him and we found him walking the halls alone in his cap and gown. I told him that I needed to talk to him and all my friends ran away and watched from afar. Now it\u2019s just us. I chickened out and instead of telling him \u201cI like you\u201d, I told him that I was going to miss him (although he probably didn\u2019t know who I was up until now). I wished him luck and that I hope he\u2019d do well in high school. I was going to say the words but tears were stinging my eyes and I couldn\u2019t speak because there was a lump in my throat. I couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and just cried in front of him. I turned to walk away because I was so embarrassed. Suddenly he called my name and I was like WTHHH HE SAID MY NAME! (Lmaoo) I turned around, he had his arms open, and asked me if I wanted a hug. I kid you not my heart was malfunctioning in that moment. My brain couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening in those 2 seconds I was trying to process it. I stood there staring, looked at him, and I gave him a huge bear hug. I seriously didn\u2019t want to let go. I remember burying my face in his chest and touching his back with my hands. I knew he had a girlfriend, but I didn\u2019t care anymore. For the first and last time I hugged my crush. It was the best feeling in the world. However the real confession was made months later over text. 2nd attempt: He went to high school and rumors went around that he broke up with his girlfriend, so ME BEING ME, I decided to shoot my shot. I got in contact with him through Snapchat. I would text him constantly to the point where I was clingy af. I then asked for his number and spent hours texting him. He would always write back one word answers but I didn\u2019t care. One day I got so confident that I was like FUCK IT. I told him that I liked him. I don\u2019t have the texts with me anymore because I had to get over him and it involved deleting everything. It is blurry to me now, but I remembered him friend zoning me in the nicest way possible. It went along the lines of \u201cyou have potential\u201d and that he\u2019d rather be friends with me. Of course I kept on texting him after that but my friends told me to wait one week to see if he\u2019d text me back. He never did, and we didn\u2019t talk to each other after that. That was 3 years ago and I\u2019m now in high school. We don\u2019t go to the same high schools, we don\u2019t text each other, and I don\u2019t follow him anymore. It has made me glow up in a way. It has taught me how to say thank u next and learn how to love myself. I don\u2019t regret confessing to my crush because I was able to learn from that experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I did and I regret it. My crush\u2019s name is Thomas. And I have a crush on him for two years. Thomas is a handsome norwegian boy with a pair of beautiful blue eyes and his face really like this:  I started crushing on him when I met him the first time,l was a new student at his class. Thomas was sitting on his chair, smiling at me. And said:My name\u2019s Thomas.\u2019 \u2018Ok girlll!!He\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 hot but it doesn\u2019t mean you can scream and kiss him hard on the mouth.\u2019 (really?!) That was the first thing that pop into my brain. Me and Thomas nearly became best friends and I was super happy with him on these last two years in elementary school. But things aren\u2019t jolly when we started middle school. He barely talk to me. What happened??? I thought, my friend told me that boys want to toughen themselves to be more cooler, not getting bullied and getting a girlfriend. But Thomas talks to the other girls very much!! I ended up being very jealous and having nightmares about him and the other girls. Okay!! Time to talk about my confession to Thomas.Not a very long time after I started middle school, my class knows I have a big crush on Thomas. Everyone started convincing me to confess my feelings to him. I was soft at that time. So three months ago, in a room full of 40 people. I tell Thomas that I have a crush on him, and he said: That\u2019s ok.\u2019 it means:fuck no.\u2019 In his brain. I got rejected. But luckily, my best friends rushed over to hug me and started cheering me up. After that, we never talked together, but Thomas tries to talk to me, but I said:\u2019Stay away!I know having a crush on you is a god damn crime!\u2019 You\u2019re probably wondering:Why Thomas rejected you?\u2019 Well\u2026: 1.I am not beautiful. 2I\u2019m from Hong Kong, not Norway. 3.I am very loud and dramatic. 4.I always cry. So now, I still love him, although he unfollowed me on IG.(hahaha) I hope me and Thomas can have a chance to be best friends again. Edit: Thomas, if you are readin\u2019 this, I\u2019m sorry that I love you more than friends. You can hate on me, be mad at me, be cold to me. But, S'il vous pla\u00eet. Don\u2019t hurt me. Just what I said: Loving Thomas Lund is a god damn crime. E2: Annnd today is his birthday\u2026I ended up writing a essay to Thomas and he did send me something afterwards.  Annnd his reaction:  * Sigh* Mamma Mia here I go again\u2026. #Mycrushisaplayboy E3: Monsieur Thomas Lund hates me, because he takes away one of my friend\u2019s phone without permission, I got mad and nearly kicked his balls. Annnd he block me on IG (yay) . F\u00e9licitations! Maintenant Thomas Lund te d\u00e9teste tr\u00e8s bien. (Now Thomas hate you very damn much) Can somebody tell me why I am crying now? P.S: Loving Thomas Lund is going to have consequences.  Socles JF ",

            "answer_text": "Yes,I can. But before I confessed to her, I confessed it to her father. Wooooh,slow down. I must tell it from the beginning. So, at in my high-school days,I was a really asocial boy who was very shy next to girls. I was never talking to girls. I was not gay per say,but since I reached my puberty,I was very shy to even talk to a girl. I spend most of my time with my friends at the dorm playing League of Legends back then. Then there was a girl in my class. I won\u2019t spoil her name so let\u2019s just call her \u201cMy crush\u201d. She had brownie-blondie wavy hair and she had a beautiful smile.And her eyes\u2026  Her eyes were just like that. Her eyes were out of this world for me. She had heterochromia,color of both of her eyes were different. Blue and green. She was a beautiful girl but like I said,I wasn\u2019t talking to any girl back then I didn\u2019t had anything special for her. Then one day,because I didn\u2019t choose any extra class for the term,principal of our school forced me to select Drama classes as an extra class. And my crush was in that class too. I thought Drama classes would be very boring but I was wrong. It was really funny and I was spending a significant time with my crush in the plays we played together. At one of the plays,we were playing as pre-school kids. I was playing as a bully which was bullying other boys but was really nice and protective towards. I was bullying everyone that do bad things to her, I was even bullying the teacher. At the rehearsals of this play,she would put her legs over my legs to anger me and I would get angry and shove off her leg back. At those sequences she would smile to me with a very seductive look. It was really hard to resist. Then we started talk to each other in other classes. We would study the exams together, play some childish games stuff like that. I was really relaxed when I talked to her. I could feel that she had something towards me and my confidence was growing. I could not believe that I was able to talk to a girl comfortably. Then\u2026  I fell in love with her. I could not talk to her after that. When I tried to talk to her, I was feeling like my tongue was stuck and could not move. I started to see her in my dreams, I wanted to talk and tell how I feel about her but I just cannot. My silly manly hormones were not allowing me to talk to her. I started to get mad and told some of my friends about my crush. They give me some courage but I still could not talk to her. Then one day, one of my friends came and said to me: \u201cWe told the inspector that you love his daughter. He is incredibly angry right now and wants to talk to you. You must go to him,if you don\u2019t,he will beat you up.\u201d Oh,sorry. I must talk about her father first. He was an inspector in our dorm and he was a really cool dude but I actually didn\u2019t like him. And I was always thinked that he would do bad things to me if he heard about my feelings about her daughter. So,getting back to the story,I was like: \u201cIs this a joke? Or is it serious? Oh my God what will I do? Ahhhhhhhh,I\u2019m really nervous,I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My other friends joined this joke and started to motivate me with words like: \u201cYou can do this.\u201d \u201cIt is not wrong to love.\u201d \u201cSay it to his face.\u201d \u201cYou are a coward if you don\u2019t say it.\u201d \u201cWe thought you were a man,dude.\u201d I was confused and afraid. I walked down the stairs and peek from door of the TV room. He was there. He saw me and I get vack immediately. I thought: \u201c Oh, he was looking really angry I am damned for sure.\u201d I hesisated but with my friends\u2019 stupid words to motivate me,I encouraged myself and walked in. There were almost 30\u201340 people there and all of their eyes turned to me. They were watching Survivor in TV as I could remember. I walked and sit next to the inspector. Our conversation was something like this: Inspector- Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself for sitting right next to me? How do you call yourself a man? Me- *just silently looks to him* I was embarrassed. I could not even talk. He was angry. He was so angry that he started to beat me up with\u2026  A phone charger. You heard me right,with a freaking charger. He just started to hit me the cable of the charger smiling at me. Even he was joking with me. Me- What they told you about me is the truth. Inspector- Nobody told me anything about you. I think to go away to my room and just sleep to escape this nightmare but I couldn\u2019t. I was embarrassed and I said these magical words: \u201cI love your daughter.\u201d He just looked to me and said: \u201cSo what? They are joking with you,just go to sleep.\u201d And that was it. I was angry,sad and hopeless. I just did what he said,I went to sleep. Next day after the first class, I immediately sit next to my crush and I confessed myself. I told her: \u201cI love you\u201d. She rejected me. After that,she learned about my stupidity against her father and never spoked to me again for almost a year. And I swear to myself to not to talk to any girl ever again. Ever! But, I was actually fooling myself. Next year we got along and she dismissed everything in the past and I realized I was still in love with her . For the last two years in my high-school life I tried get back her love and never to make her be offended by me. I never gave up. And, one day,on a beatiful summer day,I finally\u2026  I failed. I never confessed myself to her again. I was in love with her,but I didn\u2019t had any hope this time. It was clear to me that it was not happening. There was zero chance for me. She was knowing I still loved her but she was not into me anymore and I accepted it. And I just buried my love to my heart. Now it has been 2 years since I last saw her and I don\u2019t know where she is or what she does nowadays. My friends told me she has a boyfriend nowadays but I don\u2019t care anymore. I have somewhat of a mixed feelings towards her right now though I don\u2019t really hate her. Now she is just a bitter memory in my mind. Thanks for reading this far. It might seem absurd but this was a real story. Hope you enjoyed. ",

            "answer_text": "Well here\u2019s a little life hack that took me 13 years to learn: you\u2019ll only get anywhere with your crush if you actually tell them you like them. So yes, out of 5 or so crushes I\u2019ve had in my life, I confessed to 3 of them. For the sake of being concise, I will relate the most amusing incident. Just as a little disclaimer, I don\u2019t normally say stuff like this. I was just in a highly pressurizing situation and kind of blurted the first thing that came to my mind. Right after I turned 16, I started liking the boy I sat next to in Calculus class. He was a senior and I was a junior at the time, so I never really saw him outside of those 90 minutes thrice a week. He was kind of like a unicorn to me; really tall (6 foot 2, if I remember correctly), really blonde, and really fascinating. We talked about anything and everything; math, yes, but also about his twin younger brothers, about our dogs, stupid things our friends had done, you name it. Our teacher assigned a project to us that we could have easily done over a few lunch periods, but I somehow convinced him that wouldn\u2019t work and that we had to meet up outside of school. He was 18 and had a car, so he said he\u2019d pick me up from my house and we could work on the project at Starbucks- but he failed to mention his friends, who were also in the class, would be there too. Now, his friends were all great people, but I was stuck in Starbucks with a bunch of 17 and 18 year old boys that I had largely never spoken to before. I was very nervous- dropping pencils, misplacing papers, forgetting basic trigonometry, and my fingers were shaking, which made typing torturous. I think he sensed something was off, because I had never acted like this before. After two hours, when all his friends had finished but we were still only about halfway done, he told them to go ahead and he\u2019d stay back and drop me home when we were done. I was back to normal within an instant. We finished the project within another half an hour and were just sitting enjoying our coffee when he turned to me and said, \u201cso, what do you want to do now?\u201d And because I\u2019m an actual idiot, without thinking I replied \u201cyou.\u201d He only looked shocked for a split second before starting to laugh. \u201cI meant if you wanted to go home now or not, but that\u2019s good to know.\u201d I thank my lucky stars every day that he liked me back, because if not I would never have been able to show my face in Calculus again.

            "answer_text": "So this was like a few days ago but basically me and my friend were talking about the boy I like and I really wanted to tell him I liked him. Usually when I liked a boy he would find out through someone else so I really wanted to tell this boy myself as I really like him. so I get home and I literally freak out for a solid 30 mins and was actually not going to text him. This boy that I like, he\u2019s not really my friend but he\u2019s in a few of my classes but him and my friend are friends. So I finally text him and I say this. \u2018Hey, somethings been really bugging me lately so I\u2019m gong to tell you. I like you. I don\u2019t expect you to say anything but i just wanted you to know\u2019 so I wait around 40 mins for him to reply and obviously I\u2019m freaking out at this point as I had no clue what I was going to say and how he was going to react. So I text my friend and she\u2019s telling me to just open the message, When I opened it all that he said was \u2018aw\u2019. One of my friends told me that it was the worst response you could get so obviously I get really upset. But I text him back with a smiley face and he texts back with a smiley face and a love heart. So I left it at that since I didn\u2019t want anything to be awkward. Fast forward to 2 days later, I\u2019m with my friend and I asked her to send my streaks for me as my fingers were really stiff ( it was extremely cold ). So she sends the streaks but she also goes and messages the boy I like\u2026 we have a week off from school so the reason I told him that I liked him then was because I wouldn\u2019t see him for a week, but she goes and texts him and I didn\u2019t really know what to say. So we were just sending each other photos and then he ignored my snap. I was probably overreacting but I got a bit upset. It\u2019s not the greatest story but I was so proud of myself for telling him, I just wish that he felt the same for me :( ",

            "answer_text": "I have done it and we\u2019re still friends. After a massive case of broken heart, I moved on from my then crush to a friend I\u2019ve known since 1st grade. He was a friendly boy who respects my boundaries (no physical contact and no catcalling for the love of God), loves history, ASOIAF, and GoT, and most importantly responds cordially when I talk to him. His birthday is on January 6th and school started at January 10th so I figured out I could give him a gift and greeting card. I bought the gift in December along with a birthday gift for me. I bought him a Jon Snow Funko Pop and I bought myself a Margaery Tyrell one.   On the midnight of his birthday, I texted him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and he asked me how did I know. I told him I found his birthday in the elementary school yearbook (actual story). On the eve of the first day of the 2nd semester, I made a birthday card for him using some stuff I bought. I wrote \u201cHappy (belated) Name Day\u201d at the front with gold marker. In the right hand page inside, I wrote \u201cMay You Always Be Satisfied\u201d with 3 different fonts. The left hand page was the most special, I wrote a heartfelt but short letter confirming my crush on him and how I want both of us to still be friends. I put the card in a customized envelope\u2014which means there were gold smudges I made using my tips of my fingers, glued it shut, and sealed it with wax. I made sure the only thing that indicated my involvement was the \u201cD\u201d in the stamp. I safely put the card and figurine in my school bag and be very excited and nervous for the next day. On the fateful day, I waited until we were allowed to go home to give the things. I walked to his class and waited. I was planning to do the deed in front of my ex-crush for good measure though it didn\u2019t happen. His class got dismissed a bit later than mine so I had few extra minutes to prepare my psyche. He went out of the door and this conversation (or at least the gist of it) happened, Me: Can we talk for a second? Crush: Sure. (we walked away from the stream of his classmates going home.) Me: (searched my bag and found the gifts) Happy birthday. I\u2019m sorry the box is lost. Crush: It\u2019s alright, thank you. (took the gifts and went on his merry way0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t directly say you have a crush on him, Dea!\u201d you might say, but I think this comes as close as I\u2019ll ever be. He did read the letter though so yeah. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Recently. Let\u2019s call him Adam. I met Adam through mutual friends. He went to a different school at the other end of the city we live in, and was in the year below me. We had chatted before a bit before meeting in real life with a group of our mutual friends, and from the first day I met him, I had a thing for him. So inevitably I told one of our mutual friends, and he informed me Adam felt the same, but he would be too nervous and shy to do anything. So I decided to take matters into my own hands by telling him that I liked him, and giving him the opportunity to tell me how he feels. The conversation went something like this. Me: Hey, can I tell you something? Adam: Of course. Me: I kinda like you, just thought you should hear it from me. Adam: *heart emoji* Of course I was bummed out that he didn\u2019t tell me he felt the same way, so I took this as a sign that he had lost interest, or didn\u2019t even like me in the first place. We kept chatting, and surprisingly it wasn\u2019t awkward. I told our mutual friend what had happened, but he kept insisting that he liked me, and more people came forward saying that he told them he likes me. And at this point I was extremely confused! Cut to about a month and a halve after telling him I liked him, we were having one of our daily conversations when I decided to take the risk of asking him if he really likes me. Me: I was wondering if you really like me? Because people are saying that you do and honestly, I have no idea. Adam: Aha, yeah I do. Hurrah! We kept chatting for about 2 weeks, our friends trying to bully both of us into asking each other out when I finally got sick of nothing happening. Me: Hey Me: Wanna date? Me: Or something along the lines of that Adam: Sure Not my proudest moment, but we weren\u2019t going to see each other in real life for another few weeks, and I was getting impatient. Our relationship lasted for about a month, when we decided it was best if we were just friends. And to this day he is one of my closest friends. ",

            "answer_text": "I have never confessed to a crush. At least not to their face. When I was in primary school (around age 6 /7) I told a friend and my friend told my crush. I am a teenager now and I\u2019m considering confessing to my latest crush. Anyway I can however tell you what its like to hear the confession not tell it. When I was in intermediate school (around age 11/12) a guy called Matthew had a crush on me. He was very obvious about it. We had a compulsory ballroom dancing course (a whole eight weeks) and I wasn\u2019t there the day they decided the partners. Matthew leaped at the chance to be mine. As far as I remember that was when I realized he liked me. I tried to be nice about it but there was a lot of drama. I wish I had handled it better but I was truly stupid. Lots of things happened leading up to him confronting/confessing to me. He called me his girlfriend in front of older kids at our school and I shot that down pretty quickly. Which unfortunately came across harsh. Other girls in my class told him I had a boyfriend and again I told him that was a lie. Why? I don\u2019t know I just felt oddly guilty lying about something like that. Anyway one day outside our spanish classroom Matthew confronted me. I was literally backed against glass. He said \u201cM you know I like you\u201d and I have for awhile or something like that. My reply well\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201cI\u2019m just really reserved towards my feelings towards people in my class.\u201d Hes like \u201cI know\u201d. Thats the bull I came up with in the moment though. I really reserved? At last I was saved by the bell aka my spanish teacher opening the classroom door. Matthew and I had many discussions before and after that. I tried to be nice through it all but either ended up leading him on or offending him. For example he had just had braces put in and I\u2019d remembered him only being able to have marshmallows for a treat in some class, so I put together a whole jar for him. So why shot down someone who I remembered details about and someone who was sweet, the truth is he decided he liked me but putting our names in to a compatibility test. We came in with 90% and apparently that was good enough for him. He was known for having a crush on a girl every year so I didn\u2019t consider myself special. He didn\u2019t like me for me he liked me because I was the only girl who wasn\u2019t awful towards him. or intentionally awful anyway. Another reason is that there was no chemistry between us. I didn\u2019t feel anything for him even though I thought about being with him. ",

            "answer_text": "It might look fictional but it\u2019s true. I got a crush on a girl in my childhood. (Means I liked a girl and today we call that choice a crush) *hehe* We were in the same class from 1st to 3rd class , we never talked though and she got transferred. Her roll number was last in the girls section and my roll no in the boys was last.(As because the roll numbers are in serial order but roll number of girls come first, then boys.) and I remember this because I used to dream and wished that someone would say that the Last Roll number will sit together from today, which was never going to be happen and yes, it never happened. (Khuli aankhon ke lambe lambe sapne) Current scenario: I accidentally found her on Instagram, initially I was amazed whether it is she? or someone else. I decided to send a follow request , and she didn\u2019t accept. I would like to thank Instagram for its feature that we can send messages to anyone without coming in the followers list. I send a message \u201c Are you the same girl whose dance was mesmerizing during childhood\u201d.\u201dI was your classmate once\u201d. (She used to dance on kajraare song, back then) Yeah, it worked.. She replied very politely \u2018 yeah, i am that girl \u2019. I was on cloud nine. The conversation was about to begin. And what she did ... She took the screenshot of my message and posted it on her story with the caption as follows and I have taken the screenshot of her story : \u201cThank insta \u2026pta nhi kitne purane dosto se mulakat krwa deta h. He was my classmate in class 1 but still I can\u2019t remember thatbut boys remember every girl\u201d Here it is.  BOYS REMEMBER EVERY GIRLS\u2026. HAHA \u201cA bit sweet\u2026 Boys remember every girls to pata nahin ....par \u2026\u2019tum yaad ho \u2019. So, i initiated the chat and after some hours amid talking I told her that she was my crush in school time. And and and.. the very next moment I was blocked. . . . Sadness was too much. Epilogue: I have not saved her photo because I haven\u2019t think of being blocked by my crush within an hour. I only have this screenshot as a memory. PS: Didn\u2019t get any serious crush, apart from her, till today. That is how I confessed to my crush. :) ",

When I saw her I was like \u201cIs she an angel\u201d, I literally got shocked she just passed infront me and I was starring at her. I sat there for 2 hours just to see where does she stay. I got even more happy she stay beside my house. One day , when I was going to school she too came outside with her bicycle to go to school.( Her and mine schools are not same). I followed her, and got to know in which school she is studying. Next day morning, I was waiting outside my home for her to come. On bicycle we both had small conversation: Me: Hiii\u2026. She : sorry, do I know u.. Me: no u don't, ur pen got fallen on road , so I came to give u\u2026( It was just a way to talk with her, it was my pen, later what happened shocked me) She: ohh thank you so much and took the pen\u2026 and by the time she reached school, she went ( I was like, Mera pen to Gaya) On that day while coming back to home evening, she meet me and she returned the pen back saying \u201c Hey this was not mine, actually I too have same pen, I thought it is mine\u201d . So as days passed , we became friends and I thought I should express my feelings for her. Next day. It was her birthday,, I went to rose shop, purchased 3 to 4 roses, and waiting for her to come back from school. When she came I called her on terrace: Me: Hiii, how was ur day.. She: It was super excited. Me: why what happened.. She: One of my classmate who I loved from many days, finally he proposed me. ( I was scattered from inside , and donno wat to say) Me: Ohh thats very nice.. and wish u a very happy birthday and bf.. She: where is my gift.. ( I gave her roses and I left, I was not able to see in her eyes) Me : I have some work I will meet u later\u2026 I thought that her happiness is my happiness\u2026 and I got far away from her life.. I was leaving for other city for studies, and while going I said her only one line. \u201c Iss naacheez ki kabi zarurat ho to yaad Karna, ye Banda hazir ho zaayega Tere liye\u201d.. This was a small story of my first love in my life\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I have been wanting to write this answer for a while now but somehow I never got it. I had previously confessed to my crush from school but unfortunately I don't have the screenshots of that. Fast forward to second year of college, I had a crush on this guy from my class ( I had seen him before that but I didn't know who he was). I decided to take the huge step of asking him out even though he liked someone else.    At first he did tell me that he liked her but later he said that he didn't want to hurt me if we were in relationship. I couldn't handle this and I told him I didn't want to talk him. College was awkward for the next few days and I tried hard to avoid eye-contact with him. It's been a couple of months now and I ended up talking to him again cause he was an amazing friend. Recently, we had this conversation and it was so genuine and I could finally understand his perspective.       So this is how my story went and I don't have any regrets. For anyone out there who likes someone, please do yourself a favour and tell them. It could be for the better or worse but it'll be a very good decision :) Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "When I was 16 I was totally in love with this guy. He was 15, we worked together in a kind of teen association, we were good friends and I knew he didn\u2019t like me, because he talked to me about the girls he liked. I liked him, a lot. And I knew he was not interested in me, but what could I do? At the same time he talked about other girls, he was the kind that make jokes, hug you, hold your hand. So one day I decided that I didn\u2019t want to think about him anymore, and only one thing could free my heart. I needed to listen his lips telling me he didn\u2019t want me. So I called him to my home, made him seat in front of me, and told him there was something very important and difficult to tell him. \u201cI like you. And I know you don\u2019t like me, I know you like [the name of the other girl]. But I need you telling me this, here and now, so I can stop picking any small things you say as a sign that we could have a relationship\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen so many changes in the color of other one face. He didnt\u2019t say anything. He just hold my hands, with a very kind and moved expression in his face. There was no surprise, I knew he didn\u2019t like me, but I just needed to do that. It was a very wise decision. I think this was my major event to overcome shyness. After this evening, I felt I could do anything. It\u2019s something I tell anyone: make something that seems really difficult, and anything after that will seems easy. Not totally easy, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that insuflate your heart with courage. If you have never confessed to your crush, please, do this now. To listen a \u201cno\u201d is no big deal, it\u2019s something that can happens to anyone. The worst feeling is the anguish of thinking you might have worked out, just if you had the courage to tell him or her. ",

It started 7 month back, while one morning, i was going to office by bike. While i entering to main road, i saw a girl riding on her two wheeler, i just looked at her for a fraction of second, still i remember the scene, That look is still playing in my mind like video whenever i am thinking about her. Then daily i started to following her. I started my CIA work to find her details, First i noted her vehicle color then i saw her vehicle registration number. Every day I sharply left home at 8.20 in the morning, on that time she will come from my opposite side. Since it's a single way road, i can able to see her for not more than 5 second in a day. For that 5 second, i waiting for her on every day. One day i found, her house. After that i checked voter list of that area, so i could able to guess her name, Let call her name as 'R'. She is working in a very famous Hospital of the city. Everyday she wears blue color saree, and looking beautiful, pretty, gorgeous and what not?. Now i started liking her and doing social engineering in every social media just to know her. But i unable to find her profile. Its half year already over, I hope this is not just a crush, I am sure that it is love. Now daily I parked my bike near roadside to see her, sometimes she noticed me. 2\u20133 time she smiled to me. Today morning, as daily routine I thought to park my bike near road side, that time she came on road and caught me, little smile found on her face after she come to know the truth. Here by I will daily update the status. At last I maintained a attendance register whenever I saw her mark a tick on it, I think I am become a MD. Isn't it? Update:- Due to lockdown I never saw after 13 march, but today I saw her. That moment I was blank, but after 1 minute smile in my face. Thanks God {} ",

I decided to write a letter professing my love and give it to him the next day. On the next day, I was having second thoughts like \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t handle the rejection?\u201d I almost decided to not give it to him at all. We were on the train going home from school and I was just sitting there just having this war with myself while he was a few seats away talking to our mutual friends. The doors opened up to my station and it was time for me to leave. But I just stood there in front of him before I finally grabbed the letter from my book bag, threw it at him, said \u201cText me when you read this\u201d, and dashed out the train doors. I was so nervous while I was waiting for him to text me back. I mean, i wrote the letter really short and sweet-he should\u2019ve texted me by now. So i texted him first telling him that I was anxious. This was how the convo went:  We go to a catholic school and there was a religion quiz on the Nicene Creed the next day. I gave my crush my homework instead of my love letter. I\u2019m pretty sure I just told him to study for the quiz and just dropped the subject all together. But I think he knew what that paper was really supposed to be. ",

            "answer_text": "I had an intense crush on a fellow coursemate since the first year of university. The reactions I got from him suggested that he was interested in me too. There was once we bumped into each other like 7 days in a row when there were no lectures and including weekends. He would often smiled at me when it was just the two of us (we had totally different clique of friends). Once he even jumped up when we bumped into each other on a non-lecture day, but when our eyes met he stared into mine and smiled. I had always wondered if those were all coincidences, but anyway, as I knew he was going on work placement in the third year of university (I wasn\u2019t), I suppressed my feelings and decided to not do anything. I told myself, it was impossible anyway. He seemed to be trying hard to control his feelings as well. The last time we saw each other was after our final exam. Someone from our cohort suggested for the whole class to take a group photo. When I reach the place where we were going to take the photo, his friends and him were already standing there prepared for the photo session. My friends and I joined in. I was too nervous to stand directly next to him so I left a gap between us. Eventually other people started filling in the space between us. I tried stealing glances at him and realised he did the same. We both did that a few times, and finally he stopped and just looked directly into my eyes. The next moment was the saddest moment I had in the last few years. He smiled at me, but I saw tears in his eyes. Fast forward a year, he left for placement and I was still at university. Sitting in the lecture halls we used to have lectures together and walking on the streets where we used to always see each other, instead of fading, my feelings became hard to ignore. It was terribly painful being stuck in a place with so many bittersweet memories. I still had final year exams to deal with, but I had to move on. So, I decided to confess. Took me a good few days to actually do it - didn\u2019t even do it face-to-face, I just sent a text, but trust me, that moment I thought I was going to die. He did reply. He said thanks but sorry, and wished me best of luck with my exams. Although it wasn\u2019t a positive outcome, I wasn\u2019t disappointed. In fact, I could foresee that happening. I felt relieved. Finally. After 2 years. However, feelings are sometimes hard to control. Confessing didn\u2019t stop me from liking him. I continued liking him for a further 3 years\u2026 but I guess, I have done my best. At least I have no regrets. I still think of him every now and then, he still has a special spot in my heart, but I can now say, I have finally moved on :) ",

I thought this would not be any problem and can bear this if I want to be with her. I decided to share my feelings with her on friday . I was prepared, if she said yes I will spend the weekend with her and if no then weekend will be with Old Monk. The day came and before I could ask her one of my senior confessed his feelings with her. I was shattered and wanted to cry but I didn\u2019t. Weekend came and I was with my only love \u201cOld Monk\u201d. Since we were in the same team I would observe their conversations. I had no intentions but they went quite loud some time that everyone could hear. She would tell him how to stand and dress.She would shout on him without any reason.She made fun of him in front of me and other team members.Her birthday came and he gifted her mini Taj Mahal (a statue) and she replied by saying \u201ccouldn\u2019t you find anything better\u201dHe arranged a lavish dinner reservation for her in a 5* hotel which she cancelled last minute.Few weeks later I saw change in his behavior. He was depressed & frustrated and one day he told me that he is feeling toxic & want this relationship to end and asked me how to get out of it. For a moment I thought this could be my chance to get her in my life, but since I\u2019ve observed a lot I decided to not go for her. Yes, they brokeup. I was neither happy nor sad. Just had a thought what would have happened if I had asked her out that day. I was with my love again. \u201cOld Monk\u201d you see.. Cheers!  Image - google ",

            "answer_text": "MY INCURABLE CRUSH ( I gave this name to my story because I don't want to fall in love again ) This story is of five parts The ExposureThe AcquaintanceThe ProgressionThe complicationThe doom (It's a complete end)The Exposure. It all started over a year and 9 months ago... It is mid-September, Saturday and the time is around 17:00-17:30, the time we usually get off from school. Many people are laughing and talking around me followed by the sound of horns. There is a guy, tall, but not so hot, got good hair, admirable face, and a nice smile plastered on his face approaching towards me. I thought he was coming to me, but he met one of my classmates... I saw him until he left... And my mom came to pick me up. I went home thinking about him which never stopped. The next day, I went to school. I thought of asking about him to the girl he spoke to. Fortunately, she is absent. So, I asked my friend about her and she said that the boy I was thinking about is the boyfriend of the girl from yesterday. OKAY THEN, NEVER MIND! After a week or a fortnight, I saw him again. I was just roaming around the streets near my School with three of my friends.There is a group of people talking to a person who folded his arms across his chest and kneeling against a black bike. He is my ishk. FINE, DON'T ACT WEIRD. I passed him and my first thought was, \"oh my god !why does he sound so harsh?\".I turned back instinctively to find him already looking at me with those black colored eyes of his. I gasped and looked away to hide my blush that is starting to creep into my face from my neck. I never shared about him with anyone because he had a girlfriend, who is my classmate. So, NO NEVER. I even got his name. I convinced myself that it's okay, that it's just a tiny teensy crush that would go away. Because I know that I will never meet this guy. The Acquaintance. After many days... It was my first day at my new school. So, I went early and occupied myself on an empty bench. After 20 minutes, I saw a figure entering the class. When I looked up, it's him. WHAT THE FUCK!!! I can\u2019t stay here. I sat quietly and never talked to anyone from his class. I went home in the very next period and asked my mom to shift the section. Thus, I have shifted from section A to section B. So, here comes the best part. I used to see him daily. He laughs so well for me. Maybe, I have fallen for the smile. I used to see him after every period. I\u2019m glad that he never caught me seeing him. I used to see him from far..he never noticed me seeing at him(which I am very thankful for because who wants their first impression on their crush as a crazy creepy stalker). Continuing with this schedule. He was absent for a week. I don\u2019t know, what happened to him. I suddenly became sad and started missing him. I missed the way he used to smile. I miss the way he used to pout whenever he doesn't understand the teacher because I\u2019m way too attached to the way things are before. It is the best thing so far. I never dared to go and talk to him. He is finally back and I got to know that he was absent because he caught dengue. His absence wanted me to talk to him. I don\u2019t know how to speak to him. Since we share the same school, I got his id number somehow and started seeing his results before he sees them(Totally, not creepy). His harsh voice slowly became good for me. Days passed by quickly. One fine day, I have decided to talk to him. I tried but he never made a glance at me. As being a pro at stalking, I decided to create a fake account and just to have a small conversation with him. So, the mission started. I made an account. And texted him. A message instantly popped on my chatbox who are you? what should I message him? \"A girl from your class who has an insane crush on you and created a fake account just to chat with you\"? Nah!doesn't sound good. So, I sent him a reply. I am someone who is fed up with everything. Would you like to be my anonymous friend? Okay, I know that I lied to him because all I wanted to have is a small conversation with the person I loved. His message came in a little while later. sure! :) It went all good for a week. We chatted daily. But, I realized that I am getting way too attached to him. so, I deleted my account. Even though I convinced myself I had enough chat with him, I was dying inside just to talk to him. So, after a week or so, I created a new account and texted him. This time, I opted for being open with him. So, I told him that I know him and confessed to him. He started flirting with me which I know is just because he wanted to know who am I. He also said sometimes stuff like how he never cares for looks and loves me internally and that I should not restrict myself talking to someone I love. He also said that I can be his new year resolution and blah blah blah. I know that he never meant a single word. After many days, I felt like it's not going anywhere. He wanted to know about me so badly. So, he proposed that we can be good friends. But, I can't be friends with someone I love. So, I sent him the most heartfelt word Goodbye\u2026 The Progression. Anamika!It is the name that he assigned to me since he doesn't know my name. I wished to remain as Anamika permanently. And then, something unusual happened. He accused me of playing with his emotions. He also went so far as to say that I am not letting him sleep peacefully ( I wished that he meant nicely because I don't want him to think of me as some chatting nightmare named Anamika who haunts him in his dreams). He even started using mobile in chemistry class so that he could receive some hints from me. Eventually, I felt terrible for him and gave him all the hints. He found me when I was wearing a coffee-colored kurthi and he was wearing a long blue-grey shirt with white jeans with black sneakers. When we locked our eyes, something weird has erupted in my stomach. I was afraid of him. I don't know how to face him when he finally knows who the mysterious chat person is or Anamika as he calls me. When he finally know me, he lost all the prior enthusiasm as I am not enough good looking for him. He barely texted me. One fine day, I was on my way to school. When I turned around, I saw him coming in my direction. I didn't realize it until then. I still don't dare to talk to him. So, I started increasing my pace. When I was about to reach the entrance, his voice startled me. \"Why are you running away from me?\". It was the first time that he talked to me. I stood still as I have no idea what to tell him. I could hardly see his face with my watery eyes. He repeated the question. I just shook and about to answer him but he already went past me. His tall legs made him walk quickly. I just saw him until he disappeared from my sight. I am not an introvert or an extrovert. I am an optimum type of person and I act solely based on my mood. It took me a year to text him and I continued texting him when I got to know that he was single. He broke up with the girl that I first saw him with and had another girlfriend and broke up with her too. His break up story sucks by the way. He kissed his senior. Even though it's his mistake, he never blames himself. And oh, he is still in love with his earlier girlfriend aka My classmate. I know that he and I can never happen. We are not destined together, I guess. But, he gave me the hope which I don't think I can have anymore. I felt bad as I didn't respond to him. I made it clear in my head to say sorry to him in person. So, the next day, I waited for him near the gates of the school. I reached a little early. So, I had to wait for him like an hour. When I saw him coming, My heard beat escalated too quickly. I went to the class but he didn't notice me. The next day followed the same way. I waited for him again. When I saw him coming, I developed some courage, unlike yesterday. He stopped a few steps away from me and asked, \"Who are you waiting for?\" \"For you\", I mumbled quietly. He doesn't seem to like me waiting for him as his face scrunched in anger. \"I am sorry\", I said quietly. He started saying something but my mind didn't register any of it as I wrapped my arms around his neck. I think he can sense my hot breath against his neck. I nuzzled at his neck and held him closely. A calm sensation has spread through me. I placed my head on his shoulder and mumbled a quiet apology. It lasted for a heartbeat. I could feel his shoulders tense with uncomfortableness with me hugging him. I let go of him immediately. He started making his way towards the school and I followed him from behind. I was not sure whether he accepted my apology or is he still mad at me. To make up for him, I spent the next two days sketching him. I am not an artist though. I waited for him at the same spot holding the sketch, chocolate, and a note that said: \"I am sorry for everything\". When I saw him coming, I was scared and I don't want to hug him again. I ran back to my class immediately before he could see me. I asked my courageous friend to perform the task for which she obliged. But, my heart shattered when he returns me the chocolate. I was hurt. Why can't he just throw it away? Why did he give me back? Is he allergic to almonds? Does he hate me? I already know the answer to the last one. What did he do with the sketch? I was confused by his behavior. I don't know what have I done and what to do. And then, A sudden fresh idea flicked in my tiny brain. Whenever I miss him, I started to write my feelings for him on a piece of paper and used to keep them in a bottle. I wanted him to know my feelings. So, I decided to give it to him. After a week, I was waiting for him at the same spot. I waited for more than 100 minutes since there was no one at my home anyway. When he approached me, I gave him and he thanked me. To be honest, I should be the one thanking him for accepting it. We stood there in awkward silence. I wanted to break it. So, I asked him the first question that popped into my mind. \"What is your blood group?\" LOL. I don't know why I asked it. I hoped for it to not be O negative. He barely texted me. He lost his complete interest on me which I assume is due to my looks. After 2-3 days, he gave me the bottle back at the same spot that I have given him before. It made me feel hurt. Why couldn't he just throw it somewhere instead of returning? He avoided me for many days and I didn't dare to approach him. Every time, I try to talk to him, he left me feeling hurt. After some days, I got a text from him. He texted me that he needs to study for his upcoming exam and said a kind of goodbye. It used to take him 2-3 days to reply to my text. And me, being me, felt a lot of hurts. It used to make me wonder about what had I done to him. I said that if he doesn't want to text me, he could just tell me and need not bother to reply to me. He instead blocked me without even a proper word or goodbye. My heart wrenched at that. I cried for days and he had no clue about the tears that never used to stop. And then, the interesting chapter of my life has started. The hacker. The Complication. The hacker is a friend of my friend. He had answers to all my questions. We eventually became friends and used to talk with each other for hours without getting bored. I started sharing everything with him including my ishk. I told him about my strong feelings towards him and how he blocked me. So, the hacker is a sweet person he is, hacked the account of the mutual friend of my Ishk and me who used to stay in some hostel. I started chatting with my Ishk as her. And the most interesting thing is he started telling about me to the hacked account. So, he started telling about me to me. He doesn't know that of course(If he does, he is the most idiotic person in the world ). He made fun of my feelings towards him and made a joke of my love for him. I came to know about all his dirty secrets. During school, I acted normal and super cool around him. I started talking to more people than usual because I don't want him to know how much he had hurt me. So, I acted so coolly around him. One day, I came to know that he has feelings for the mutual friend aka the one whose account I have been using(What a dope!). I told him that truth that It was me all along. Unsurprisingly, He was super duper angry at me. And guess what? Surprise!Surprise! He blocked me again. I deleted this account. After confessing to him that It was me, the lockdown started after 2 days. I apologized to him many times but he never accepted because accepting me implies bringing me back to his life. But the only comforting thing among all this mess was, I still had my hacker friend by my side. He said many things about ishk and not in a good way but a bad way, a very bad way so that I could forget him. But, I was still okay with that since it happened in the past. I believed him so much that I accepted everything he said about ishk. He kept on insisting to hack my ishk account but I never let him. He said that he had a very good female friend who is an expert in brainwashing people. So, he wanted the brainwasher friend of his to talk to my ishk and make him understand my feelings towards him. Her name is aakrithi and my hacker friend said many things but I never understood one and I don't know what's gonna happen because I have a very tiny brain. I apologized to him very sincerely like... Ishk... I am so deeply deeply and deeply sorry for hurting you so much. I am so sorry because I am in so in love with you and I will spend the rest of my life telling you that. I will apologize to you every day if that's what you need. I love you please talk to me If you hate me or don't want to talk to me, please say it clearly and I will never look back at you ( The Arizona apology ) He replied to me that he indeed never wanted to talk to me. The Doom it takes time to put everything in words will update soon ",

            "answer_text": "I guess it's the right time to disclose this. Yes, I confessed. And she said nothing. One day I called her up and we both started talking for several hours. Then while disconnecting the call, I finally expressed. \u201cHey, I love you!\u201d She was literally stunned and she had no reply. Well I was so happy that I expressed. But later on when I found that she isn't going to accept me, I started losing hopes. I was totally unaware that somewhere I was her crush too, but she wasn't ready to accept the fact infront of me. I waited and waited, but I didn't get any positive response from her side. One day, I decided to move on. As I already waited for her to accept me, but she was totally blank. The day I was planning to say that I'm done, she came up with something that I wasn't expecting. She said, hey I'm going to say something that I'll never repeat. I was desperately waiting for her to say something and finally she said that she loves me too and don't ask me the reason for that. During the conversation, I made her repeat \u201cI Love You\" around 20 times. I so badly waited for that. Finally we're together and going to start a new phase of our life. God is great and I'm blessed with a wonderful soul, \u201cNeha\".  ",

            "answer_text": "Now, this is interesting. I tried to play smart. I'll elaborate the story trying not to exaggerate but yet. If you have less time then read the highlighted content Ohkay so it was my very first year of college. After 10th getting into the 11th as a fresher. I was very excited to make new friends and there was so much enthusiasm in the environment. When the exams began, we were given our seating arrangements. By that time I had made lot of friends in college. An incident took place at that time, a boy had taken admission in our college and he was appearing for his very first exams in college, that too unprepared. He instantly became a hot topic in our college for back answering a teacher. (He had his phone with him - the teacher scolded him for it - as phones weren't permitted in the examination hall) This news came to me through my friends as I previously said he was a hot topic at that time. I wanted to see who this guy was. Well, he had a very attractive personality and that drew almost every one to him. I was very desperate to know what was so interesting about him. My friends and me were passing through the corridor and we met him past the staff room. My friends enquired about getting his phone back. They whispered to me that he was the one. For a minute I tried to initiate an eye contact with him. We exchanged looks but nothing disastrous happened lol. I came home and constantly thinking about him I couldn't figure out what was going on my mind. I thought what if I had to fall for this guy. But the only thing that was exceptional was that he had an ego issue. Huh? What'd I do? Devastate my dreams. Nah, he was just out of league. Everytime I used pass by him and each day made me fall for him. This was very incomprehensible. This month was filled with college activities and the college came up with the fashion show 2017-2018. Me and my squad were now a part of this. To my surprise! I was astonished! (He was a commerce student - we were science students) inspire of that he somehow joined our group. I was utterly flabbergasted and didn't know where I was jumping out of happiness. I was so overwhelmed. With God's grace I was his partner. During our rehearsals I had to hold hands and dance. I was on cloud nine. But the only difference was that he and me would never talk. He was cool with everyone but not with me. Days passed and I started taking to him. We shared many secrets and our life stories. I made up a story of my previous crush and told him that I had a crush on a guy. Since 4 years but he's out of my league. What advice would you give me? We talked about this for like 2-3 weeks. Still the atmosphere was cold. I wasn't sure whether I should confess that the guy I had a crush on was none other than him. One day I made up my mind. By that time he had broken up with his girlfriend and was into a new relationship. He was a very good personality except for his ego though. Almost the juniors and seniors, everyone had a crush on him. I thought I must leave this. But something cane up in my mind and I thought I should tell him. I texted him and asked him whether I should tell him. The conversation was something like this. Previous night day 1- Me : Hey, I'm not sure what to do? I can't sleep. Him : Hey, why what's the problem? Me : Should I confess it to my crush? I can't hide this anymore. Him : Yes, indeed you should. Why don't you tell him? Me : I'm afraid so he won't accept me. Him : Why do even think like it? What is more important is that you must confess what's in your mind. Confessing your feelings is more important. He must know what you feel for him. Me : Ohkay cool then I'll tell him. Day 2 Me : Hey, actually I'm ready to tell my crush about the truth. Wish me good luck. Him : Yeah, sure go for it. Me : Actually, I lied. Its none other than you. I have a crush on you. Him : *astonished What? Why didn't you tell me first? Me : It's alright. I'm sorry. Him : Yes, let it be. I had to face him many a times in college but I always had to break my heart. Things never worked out well and we don't talk anymore. Cause we made it way too awkward and we wouldn't fix it. I told you previously right? He had ego issues. He had many girlfriends but then it never worked with me. Only to realise he wasn't worth the time, love and patience. Conclusion : Never fall for someone based on thier looks, it isn't necessary they have a good heart always that will nurture your feelings. Crushes are better crushes. Don't love them to the extent that you will break yourself. You shouldn't waste time feeding them with ego. If they're worth it, they will never put you down. If it doesn't work then you must move on. There are more than 7.5 billion people in the world. You're destined to the right person. Don't rush anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you my story of finding a girl I liked in college. I was in my 2nd year of Engg. when Diploma students joined our class. I wasn\u2019t much studious back then. I am an introvert who likes to spend time watching movies, tv shows, play games, read novels, etc. I am mostly on my own and don\u2019t like much company. So, Diploma students joined and luckily I attended the first lecture with them. My attendance normally was 50%. And in that lecture I saw HER. She looked very simple, no make up, sincere, hard working, focused, studious and someone that just was a duplicate of the \u2018ideal\u2019 girl I would like to marry. She was all the above things I mentioned and I fell for her, real bad. She didn\u2019t drink, smoke or do drugs like me. I couldn\u2019t resist, so I started talking to her. My approach was to let her know that I liked her and let her make any moves if she was interested. I talked to my friends about her, they thought she was an \u201cInnocent\u201d person. I asked my friends because I have seen many girls in the above 6 types and I was afraid of how they hurt men\u2019s feelings and just don\u2019t care and maybe same could happen with me. But, I got my validation from others and everything was good. I am not sure when she knew that I liked her. But, her behavior was same throughout the semester and I was shy and used to talk to her kindly. But no one told me I was naive when it came to girls. I knew I was inexperienced with girls. I had respect for her so I tried never to make her uncomfortable. I never had any sexual thoughts about her, only that I wanted to spend time with her. I got her number and tried to make conversations either via Whatsapp or through talking but she didn\u2019t ask me questions back. She only used to answer my questions, that\u2019s it. As I was inexperienced I asked my friends, they said it is normal \u2018Girls take time, maybe she is taking hers.\u2019 She used to give me smiles and I used to think she is my friend or maybe she likes me. But, I wanted to be sure. So, I asked her if she could teach me a topic in the library because she was great in academics. She denied. I thought she doesn\u2019t like me so I gave up the chase after 1 or 2 more tries. But, then she used to look at me in class. Her and her friends\u2019 behavior used to change when I crossed paths with her in college. I ignored all of it. My best friend(a guy) told me to find out if she likes me through her close friends or friends in class. So, I was nice to everyone in her friends group and even others whom she used to talk to. I became friends with a girl in her group(g1) and suddenly after a month with a friendship with her, g1 stopped talking to me. No explanation, nothing. I got confused as to why g1 wasn\u2019t talking to me, maybe I did something wrong. But I couldn\u2019t find my mistake, because I didn\u2019t do any which I realised later. I got confused and irritated about g1\u2019s and my crush\u2019s group friends giving me such different treatment. They used to not say anything just look at me with no expression. They stopped talking whenever I used to cross paths. Then, I asked myself \u201cAm I a stalker? Did I over do it?\u201d But, it wasn\u2019t the case because I needed only one look at her in a week and I was satisfied. I texted her for 2 months in the start that too once a week. I was sure I did not do anything to bother her. If she wasn\u2019t interested then why smile at me? Why her friends look at me this way? Why she would turn and look at me during classes? So many questions flooded my mind so I thought to give 1 more try. New Semester began. I tried to talk to her 2\u20133 times and she was normal. But still she looked at me in class. My best friend convinced me something is going on. You should confront her. Ask her what this is. That\u2019s it I decided to call her. I called her and told her how I felt. I asked her if she wants to know me, if she likes me, if she would like some time to know me. She repeatedly said- \u201cIt is not like that. I just like you as a friend.\u201d I got my answer, I was satisfied. I was relieved, knew now that she wasn\u2019t interested and it is finally time to give up. I never attempted anything to impress her after that. But she keeps doing these things again and again like smiling, her friends looking at me, whenever I am near she talks loudly, etc. I now just ignore all of this. Most of my friends now tell me it was all for attention and filling her ego. But I always thought she was a kind person. If someone had told me if they had a crush on me and I did not like them I would have told them- \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can be friends. If you need something you can come to me. But I do not feel the same way. I am sorry.\u201d I expected something like this back then but I don\u2019t now as she doesn\u2019t care about me in any way. I accept that she doesn\u2019t owe me anything and although she didn\u2019t say any of this, it made me more sure that she wasn\u2019t the person who I thought her to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. When I was a thirteen year old freshman in high school,I met this real cute girl in Spanish One class. From the first day I saw her, I started crushing on her, but I remained silent. I was shy and awkward around girls back then. This crush remained all through high school and not one time did I tell her how I felt. I would see her in the halls, in the cafeteria, at football games, and in the neighborhood. She had no idea of what I was feeling. We graduated and went our separate ways. I would see her in the streets from time to time and we would go down Memory Lane, laugh and talk then go our separate ways once more. Years went by, we met other people and had children, broke up with those other people and kept on going. One day I am walking down the street and saw her talking to another younger woman who was her niece. My first impulse was to keep on walking, I mean ten years had passed since I saw her last and I didn\u2019t think that we had anything to say. I walked right past her, but I got this vibe and it told me to go back. Talk to her and play catch up. Ya know?? I went back and surprised her. I was talking to both her and niece when I playfully told the niece that back in the day I had a crush on her aunt. The look on my ex-crush\u2019s face was sheer shock, but she got it together real quick and started laughing. I was on my lunch break and had to get back to work. She gave me her phone number and I gave her mine. Even though I put her number in my phone, I had no intention of calling her. I mean those feelings were long ago and we had both moved on with our lives. Two weeks pass and she calls me out of the blue, the call was so pleasant that we started exchanging phone calls. A month went by and we had a first date, which lead to a second and a third and so on. One night on a dinner date, she blew me out of the water with a stunning revelation. She told me that me that she was crushing on me all through high school as well, but she never said anything or made any kind of move. What you have to remember was back then girls and women rarely made the first move. That is the way it was. Nowadays girls and women are more secure in going after a man that they like and that is so damn refreshing. We have been together for the last ten years and chances are we will be together for the next ten. We have so much fun together,share things together and our sex lives are damn good as well. (Yeah, older folks are still doing it at our ages). So yeah\u2026..It turned out okay!! (lol) ",

Coming to the latest or last one, she is currently a batchmate of mine. We were in the same section for the past year, and I had a crush on her from the day one I saw her. So I had decided that I\u2019ll tell her when we will be in Singapore. I had to wait for the opportunity, for like almost a year. And had to make it special, so Singapore was the perfect spot for it. Coming to the Judgement Day, it was our last day in Singapore. I had decided I will confess my feelings but somehow had a change of heart. Here a few friends of my persuaded me to do so as this was once in a lifetime opportunity and then we had our summer break. And so I got convinced. We were at the Marina Bay Sands Casino as we had planned to spend the last night in Casino, but due to the latest change of heart I had, I had to go back to NTU. So a friend booked a cab (as it was past midnight the public transport was off), reached the campus by around 2:45 am. For some reason, my data network was not working, so when I reached back, connected to the campus\u2019 wi-fi, pinged her to meet me. I can clearly remember how I spent the next 20 minutes - it was like an eternity. I can still feel how my mind started thinking of every negative outcome that was theoretically possible until she replied. The moment, her message came, my body went numb. Somehow I brought myself together and then asked her to meet me outside the building as I wanted to talk to her about something important and she agreed. I rushed down, went outside and sat on the ground. My hands were terribly shaking, and I could clearly feel the chilled air in the campus. And a few minutes later, she came. God, she looked so amazing! I went speechless for a few seconds. So then she asked me what did you want to talk about. I told her everything, how I felt for her from the first time I saw her, how I had noticed every little detail about her, and all I could remember. I spoke for like 30 minutes at a stretch. My heartbeat for sure was off the charts, my hands were shaking like anything and all this while I couldn\u2019t gather the courage to look into her eyes even once. After this, she spoke and said she was happy that I told her directly, but there was nothing from her side. She hoped and asked if this doesn\u2019t change our friendship and I replied it won\u2019t. Then, at around 4:00 am she said let\u2019s go back to our respective rooms. I was still shaking and told her I\u2019ll take some time, but she asked me to go back. I couldn\u2019t say no to her, and we went back. So this was my story. ",

            "answer_text": "I did\u2026\u2026but most of anything at all,it felt relieving. I used to go to coaching classes and she came there too .It was after my boards that i thought \u201cwhy not do something i\u2019ve never done before?\u201d. I used to sit in the front row and watch her everyday.Sometimes,i would find opportunities to try and squeeze between her two friends when they used to sit near the blackboard and sit next to her (the oldest trick in the book to get acquainted). She was very average looking,infact below average compared to other girls in the class but she kinda looked cute to,and that was the biggest turn on for me,so i went for her straightaway. We used to talk in class,outside in the canteen,even on whataspp latenight.I felt like we even had a moment in the washroom when she texted me to come over there but i could\u2019nt understand her indication.We talked a bit,I drank water,then i left.The studious dumb fuck i was;D. Then came the D-Day,Our entrances were over and she wasn\u2019t coming for some days,so i decided to enquire. Finally i came to know that her dad had asked her to stop coming to classes as she was preparing to go off to college. So i decided to break the ice to her\u2026\u2026 remember ,the begining is always the hardest\u2026 But i kept stalling,nd stalling nd stalling forever\u2026\u2026\u2026. Then i finally blurted out the truth\u2026\u2026.with a little bite of philosophy and personal thoughts\u2026. you guys might be wondering,so what did she said???? Are ruko zara ,abhi thoda maza to lelo\u2026\u2026.. Even she is shocked how can I fall for her when when we had almost zero interaction \u2026\u2026.nd even i was\u2019nt sure excatly when i fell for her XD. \u2026\u2026.. .nm,shy guys do that\u2026\u2026i think.When i thought,enough blabbering,it\u2019s time to elaborate, fir to launda jo form me aaya hai na,kasam se.Poore 12 saal ki english eak jhatke me jhaad di. Nd seriously,i did\u2019nt even gave a fuck about what she had to say.;D.It\u2019s like u studied ur ass off for the exam,nd don\u2019t care about the result\u2026\u2026.. dekho chutiya fir se padhai pe aa gaya\u2026..#@#@@ When she realized it\u2019s time to respond,she replied with an equally lengthy answer.Maybe to not make me feel bad\u2026\u2026\u2026 It was sweet and truthful,but really i don\u2019t wanna believe the last thing in her first reply\u2026\u2026.. aise to ladki kabhi nhi milegi mujhe.XD.M still trying to work it out tho\u2026\u2026..but sab bekar tha ab\u2026.Appy (cold drink) bc?!?!?!??! I would still get her one tho..;) Ohhhh bc!!! now i understood what\u2019s going on.She\u2019s already taken XD.But the bigger idiocy \u2014 I knew that already but still went on for her. Alag hi level ki sakthi dekh rhe ho? Now that i started to look like a crybaby,she tried reassuring me by sugarcoating her words.. Hatts of to her for that\u2026\u2026 ignore my last texts,even i don\u2019t have an explanation for that.  Seriously i loved her gesture , asking me if had food or not :)But i hated myself for not giving attention to these feeling nd all too\u2026\u2026\u2026 warna itni care karne wali gf mil jati mujhe XD. then she sent me pics of her man\u2026\u2026.. guitar can really make a guy look cooler no??? Nm even i thought that he was goodlooking and handsome.She was clearly out of my league\u2026..However,when i met that guy a few days later at an event,where she also had come,i literally cringed at her choice.He was nothing like his pictures\u2026\u2026 crooked teeth,shabby hair,very yokelish way of talking with no strict ambition in life.I asked him his instagram id and checked out he looked cooler in that too,but i had seen him today, nothing similar to what he appeared on his photos. Then later i wondered,\u2026\u2026. maybe if I had met her earlier then something was possible.But then i realized,it\u2019s not about opportunities,when you don\u2019t have the sufficient skills in that particular field,then nothing would work out.Maybe that\u2019s what the other guy had that i lacked\u2026\u2026.. Even though I was clearly ahead of that other guy :) Edit 1 : Thanks a lot people for such a positive response at my sob story , didn\u2019t expect that .I haven\u2019t heard from her since then and don\u2019t know where she is currently.Sources tell me she\u2019s pursuing college in Noida where she is in regular touch with her bf. Good for her :) . Also,guys do tell me how you felt about my little confession story. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Alright. So over the summer my church\u2019s youth group has a week long retreat where we worship, play games, stay up late, eat junk food and have the option to compete in a music competition (Which I did and won first place that year.) My crush, who goes to my church, was also coming (His family is often very involved in the retreat.) So it was the second last day, and myself, some of my friends, my crush and a couple of his friends were all at the playground. Now, I had recently confessed to my boy-crazy friend (We\u2019ll call her Lauren). Now Lauren has a crush on a new person every day. She goes in between guys, talks about them non stop, talks to them non stop, so once she\u2019s crushing on someone new pretty much everyone figures it out within the first few hours. I hadn't realized telling Lauren was a mistake until this happened. Okay, so we were all at the playground, chilling out we had some free time before dinner. I have my ukulele, I\u2019m singing and playing along. Lauren grabs my arm and whispers in my ear, \u201c(We\u2019ll call him Aiden)- Aiden needs to hear you sing, we\u2019ll see if he likes you!\u201d So she drags me over to my crush, says, \u201cHey, Aiden! Morgan has a song for you!\u201d He\u2019s a very polite and caring person, so he listens well I do the song again, my face probably a shade of scarlet, my hands trembling out of embarrassment. When I\u2019ve finished, Lauren goes, \u201cSoooooo, Aiden, did you like it?\u201d He blushes slightly and responds, \u201cYeah.\u201d Lauren gasps and grabs my arm again. I tell Lauren we should go and just turn around to leave when Lauren shouts to my crush- \u201cAIDENNNN!!! MORGAN LIKES YOOUUUU!\u201d I stop in my tracks and turn around, ukulele in hand, pick in the other, thoughts twisting around each other in my mind. I didn\u2019t want him to find out, ever. (All my friends had kept shipping us without knowing I liked him, saying he liked me etc but I didn\u2019t want to do anything until I got the situation under control, if at all.) My crush goes red. He\u2019s obviously uncomfortable, and I don\u2019t blame him. I curse under my breathe yell \u201cBye, Aiden!\u201d over my shoulder, and drag Lauren back to our cabin, where I can demand an explanation out of her. Since then, I\u2019ve purposefully been staying away from my crush. Like I said, I didn\u2019t want him to find out. Though recently, I caught him staring at me and he gave he world\u2019s sweetest smile, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on. Curse you, Lauren. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I have had a lot of crushes since my school days but I confessed to only one of them. She is my best friend now, it lasted for exactly 2.5 years. I met her in school in year 2011, and that's when it started. We used attend the same school, same tutions and so were aiming for the same exam. One I posted a joke related to crushes, and then she asked \u201cwho is your crush btw?\u201d And 10 days later, 26th May 2014 was the time came, when I told her. I was always tensed because I already had a exam that day. I confessed her over text. It was 7.00 PM in the evening and every second felt like an hour, and then I said, \u201cyou're my crush\u201d and at that moment of time, powercut occured (a typical problem of India) and the weather was bad, there were thunderstorms, wind was blowing fast and suddenly my mobile network was gone!!!. It was like a heart attack to me, because I was waiting for her reply and there was no internet. But after a little more time, internet came back and her reply too. It was a \u201cNO\u201d. The reply was more dangerous that thunder shock. I was sad that day and it continued for 2\u20133 months, but as the time passed we became good friends and she's my best friend now. And, now I believe whatever happened was good. Before that incident I never actually talked to her, we were just classmates and not even friends and after that things changed and changed for good, she is my best friend now. Things are going good. It was a freaking experience in short term, but a good one in long term. Source : Utkarsh Nirbhay (\u0909\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092d\u092f) ",

            "answer_text": "I have and it didn't go so great (I was expecting it to go like this). So long story short a new girl came to our school. I won't say her name incase she is reading this but let's call her 'A'. So her friends called me to the table at lunch and told me that a Pakistani girl joined. I was pretty happy because you don't get many fellow Pakistanis where I live. So then she came and man her eyes and smile intoxicated me! I could stare in them for eternity. The first conversation went like this. Me: You Pakistani? A: Yeah Me: Tum Urdu Bolti ho (U speak Urdu?) A: Yeah I can understand it And etc. I tried making small talk and that but let's keep the answer short. I always dreamt of her for days and I was trying to comprehend my thoughts. When I realized she was in my maths class I was over the moon. Those days were awesome. I would try and get to know her and we always smiled at each other. She was always in my mind and then I asked my friend for help on how to approach her. Then she found out somehow and I was pretty pissed but I wanted her to hear it from me. The problem was there was a huge crowd watching and this was not well planned at all. I had no choice and this was my first time confessing. I swear her eyes seems to flash. It went something like this\u2026 Me: Mai jaanta hun ke tum yeh jaanti ho lekin mai kehna chahta hun ke mai tumse boht pasand karti hun (I know you know this but I want to say I like you a lot). I don't care if you don't like me but I just want an honest answer. A: You are a great guy and you will find a great girl one day but I don't date. Me: It's fine but I don't want to date cus we are Muslims. I just want to get to know you as a person. A: I get what you mean. So I thanked her for her honesty and have come to terms that she doesn't like me and I respect that. Her eyes and smile is always on my mind <3. But I guess we weren't meant to be. Allah has something better for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is backwards, iit's her admitting to me. DISCLAIMER: This series of events took place before i met my current girlfriend. (The above disclaimer was intended purely for my girlfriend in case she goes snooping around my Quora answers. Yes, I see what you're doing. I'm doing this for my protection.) So\u2026 A little while ago, I was working at a restaurant and I was out of boot camp for about a year and a half at this point. I didnt make this known to anyone. My manager (who is also my old man) approaches me with a girl- \u201cHey, this is the new girl. Her name is Riley.\u201d (Her name wasn't really Riley, but for the sake of identity protection we will call her Riley) So Riley was kinda shy but otherwise bright and seemingly personable. \u201cRoger that\" I say to my manager, who walks away to do manager stuff. So I give her the breakdown, I tell her what's what and I give her what she should do and shouldn't do, the whole shebang. Since I'm pretty much in charge of the servers and my managers closest advisor, I become the primary point of contact for all servers in here. \u201cOkay so that's what we do. I'm gonna give you my cell phone number, call or text any time of day if you have questions or requests.\u201d So I give her my cell phone number. She rapidly accepts. I train her up and I walk her through the complicated shit. One week later\u2026 So Riley is pretty much fully trained up and she can handle a few tables on her own. She's texted me a few times asking for clarification, the usual stuff. It's not until next week she starts getting familiar with the staff. Next week\u2026 At this point everyone knows Riley and everyone likes her. Shes pretty cool and likes to giggle. A picture perfect server if I've ever seen one. One day she asks me to give her a ride home. Granted, I wasn't working this day but I live less than 5 minutes away, so I said okay and went. She closed today, so she was already waiting for me by the time I rolled up. She happily skips to my car, and says thank you probably about 183 times (that's an exaggerated number, but you get what I mean). So she explained. Apparently something funky went wrong with her shit-mobile (1999 Honda Civic I think it was) and her engine started to misfire. No worries, I'm not getting bent out of shape. I offered her a ride in to work tomorrow. I opened at 10, but she was scheduled at 12. She accepted, knowing she would be going in at 10 instead of 12. Roger that. The day when I took her to work\u2026 So I wake up around 6. Do my morning run, eat a hearty, yet healthy, breakfast, and be ready to rock and roll on a moment's notice by so I get 3 whole hours to myself. I'm lovin' it (McDonalds pun intended). Then Riley texts me asking what time I would arrive. I told her around 9:30. I forgot I was taking her to work. So make that 2 hours to myself.9 rolls around faster than I could blink, and I'm on the road and rolling to her house. I'm there at 9:20, exactly 10 minutes before my initial reply of 9:30 (thank you, Army). She busts out of her house with her bag of makeup (I think?) And rushes to my car. She was obviously in a hurry. \u201cOkay let's go\" she says rapidly. \u201cwoah now, relax. It's only a 10 minute ride to work, and I'm here early. You can do what you gotta do.\u201d I reply. She halts in her tracks, then looks at the time. She sighs in relief. She must have thought she was running late. So with my permission, she proceeds to finish her makeup in my car while I play a game on my cell phone. Then she says\u2026 \u201cI bet your girlfriend does her makeup in your car a lot.\u201d I knew exactly why she said this, but I was gonna play her game. \u201cuh, well, heh, I dont have a girlfriend.\u201d (DISCLAIMER: THIS WAS MUCH BEFORE I MET MY CURRENT GIRLFRIEND) She looks at me and tries to make a shocked looking face, but I knew she was trying to confirm her suspicions. She apologizes for assuming, and finishes her makeup. She gives me the go, as I take my car off neutral (yes it's a manual) and go for the road.We arrive at work by 9:45. I have this whole restaurant opened and ready for business by 10:20. The kitchen opens up at 11, so my table service doesn't start until 11. So, to kill the time, I find a nice corner and play that game on my cell phone. Riley approaches my little corner and sits next to me after she is done with her stuff. \u201cI really appreciate you giving me a ride in.\u201d she says, practically hugging me. Slightly squeezing me. \u201cNo worries. Do you need a ride home?\u201d I reply. She smiles and tries to cover up her obnoxious blushing. I'm not doing this on purpose, for the record. Eventually she kindly declined, saying her mom is already coming to get her. So after that we had a busy day. It was just me and her all day until 8. I helped her out when she was in the weeds, it was a good day. I stayed behind and let her go home before me because she was gassed out. Two more weeks later\u2026 Manager tells me we need to do the dreaded cleaning day this Sunday (normally we close on sundays) and he offered to come in. Riley was off today and I was on a double with another server. I took him up on his offer as it would just be him and I doing the cleaning. Saturday night\u2026 Riley and I are on a double once again. We are just finishing up a slow, ass-dragging day and we were authorized to start breaking down 10 minutes to 8. Awesome. I waste no time and start breaking down. Manager leaves for the night. \u201cSo, what are you doing tomorrow?\u201d Riley asks. \u201cWell, I'm coming in with Jim tomorrow to clean the restaurant. So I'll be pretty tied up.\u201d \u201cJust you and Jim?\u201d she asks. \u201cRoger that.\u201d I reply. \u201cIf you dont mind, I can come in and help out.\u201d I told her I would consult with my old man, but it was almost guaranteed she would be able to come. So, I got home, I asked, and he says- \u201cPsh, you got help so I can stay home!\u201d Jim says. It's exactly what I expected him to say. \u201cJust clock in under manager when you get there\" (it's an $11 difference in pay). Roger that sir!!! So I do the thing and I tell Riley. It would just be the two of us. I told her she should wear clothes she doesn't like, or doesn't mind getting dirty. \u201cok :)\u201d she replied. Sunday\u2026 I get there early as usual and I get everything set up so when she gets here, we can start. Its 8AM at this moment, so I just sat at a table and kicked my feet onto another chair and played that game on my cell phone. I dressed in black cargo shorts and an old Under Armour tshirt. No big deal. Riley arrives at 8:15 and she assumes that since I am there before her that she is super late. No biggie. Shes in with \u201cjeggings\" (or so she calls them) and an old tshirt of a band called Sleeping with Sirens. I'm not sure if that is her taste in music, but whatever. I close out of my game and task her with the following objectives- \u201cAlrighty so you just do that little area by the bar and I'll do this area by the soda machine and we'll work our way around the place. Word?\u201d She says, \u201cI was thinking we could knock out bigger sections together so we can do the whole restaurant in one go.\u201d I\u2019m not about to argue with a female. So I agree. We do the cleaning thing and we make quick and steadfast progress. Although I caught her eyeballing me a couple of times. I knew what was going on, but I know better than to be the one to ask about it. 2:00PM rolls around and I told her we could go on a little lunch break. She happily accepted. So we ran a seafood restaurant, and the market here was pretty nifty, outfitted with all the latest tech and stocked with all kinds of fish, like black grouper, Scottish salmon, Cobia, tripletail, you name it. So I got authorization to use the kitchen. Fuck yes. \u201cSo what are you hungry for? I'll cook you something to eat.\u201d I offer. She does more blushing than deciding, but eventually goes with Salmon. I'm doing some sexy, sexy Cobia. So I turn on the gas and appliances and I get to work. She sits right at the pass and watches me do the whole thing. Kind of a weird feeling being watched. \u201cthanks for cooking, it means a lot.\u201d Riley admits. \u201cNo problem. Just doing what I do.\u201d She stood silent for a few minutes while I break out some seasonings and vegetables, and cleaning up as I go. \u201cSo you really dont have a girlfriend?\u201d she wonders. \u201cYeah, I'm pretty sure. Unless some weirdo is running around telling people that I do.\u201d Riley giggles. I serve her a Salmon A La Carte, complete with wilted spinach, seasoned seaweed, and fennel coleslaw and frisee garnish on the Salmon. I think at this point I won her heart without even trying. My own plate was a few minutes longer, but she didnt start eating until I was ready. She was brought up the right way. So we just talked and talked about bullshit and how the world should be and whatnot. Until\u2026 \u201cI think I like you. No, I know I like you. I really like you.\u201d Then before I even open my mouth, she starts firing. \u201cI thought you were cute when I first met you, and I was so glad I had your number. I didnt think we would work together as often as we have been, but I was really happy that we did. I learned so much about you so soon, and I knew then that I liked you.\u201d She said a lot more than this, but i didn't want to overflow your screen with Riley pouring her heart out. It took a good 10 minutes. I didnt really react. As usual. I was speechless, namely because she fired so fast I was having trouble keeping up. So I muster up some stones and reply. You know, the usual \u2018I'm glad we like each other' bit. So with a small hint of awkwardness but otherwise normal atmosphere, we finished up cleaning. It takes the rest of the day and we get out by 7. (I promise this answer is almost done) So I punch out and she does the same and we meet each other out back after closing the place down. With no words whatsoever, she hugs me. It scares the shit out of me since I didnt see it coming, figuratively and literally. She softly giggles at my reaction. The turns me around and the only thing she says was a small apology as she moved to kiss me. (REPEAT DISCLAIMER: THIS WAS BEFORE I MET MY CURRENT GIRLFRIEND) I'm just trying to cover my ass ^ I tasted cotton candy chapstick after I recovered from my initial shock. What the fuuuuck is up with this?That encounter lasted about a good half hour before we went home, and I spent the whole night trying to answer my own questions. It was super weird, because chiefly it came out of nowhere, but I didnt really mind.Riley left recently to move to Kansas after about 8 more months of working here. If you were wondering, she didnt kiss me again. We did hang out some days. We still keep in touch. That is all. Carry on. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I have. In fact, I confessed yesterday through text since it was the last day of school. I started the confession with a picture of cheese with a caption of: \u201cI am going to start with some cheddar.\u201d The end result was that she responded with that she saw me as more of a friend. I responded by thanking her for responding. This was due to I guess, in a way, giving me closure to my feelings for her, regardless of how heartbroken I was. Nonetheless, I had already decided to respect the response regardless of the result and I went through with it. Then, I ended the confession by saying to have a great summer and best of luck in college. I will be honest, this was the first time I ever confessed to my crush and despite the heart break, I still felt relieved in a way because I actually was able to go through confession in general and express my feelings to my crush since I am usually timid and I feel like this was a big step to a certain extent. Granted, I could have done this in person, but my only opportunity left was graduation and I started overthinking and decided to leave graduation early after the ceremony was over without the reception. In hindsight, I feel that if I confessed in person, it would make me even more nervous and possibly back out at the last second. Overall, I am glad I confessed because it gave a new experience whether it would be positive or negative, it was new. I still have lingering feelings, but over time, I will continue to move forward and persevere without the lingering feelings or making things awkward. To conclude this answer, I added the picture of cheese in the beginning because I thought that no matter what the result of my confession was going to be, I could say that the confession was \u2026 CHEESY\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I have! I have only crushed on two girls in my entire life. I have been brutally rejected when I did. I'm 23 by the way. And Crush #1 had been my crush for several years but I wasn't brave. This is how it all went down: Me: I was gonna say it over the phone, ideally would have rather said it in person and honestly I was struggling to get into position to shoot my shot. Over text feels kinda like a timid move. ( And increases the overall risk of death by receipts lol ) I hide behind jokes, yes I realize that but okay... I really like you. I'd still rather tell you in person though :) Crush #1: Okay, first of all thank you for telling me. I don't think it's easy being transparent like this. I also don't think I would have guessed it tbh. Crush #1: Secondly, I don't want to be labeled the \"friend-zoning\" girl. But I'm going to be honest and say that you're my really good friend. Which is not something I would have expected anyway. And I genuinely do appreciate you as that. So, this is where I stand with you. Me: Okay, thanks for your honesty. I was mentally prepared for this moment, but somehow it did not make it any easier. One last question, is there hope for me or am I just holding on to a lit candle in the wind here? Crush #1: Honestly, it's the candle bit. The only relationship I see you and I in is a healthy friendship, if that's cool with you. If not, then I respect whatever decision you take from here on tbh. Me: It feels like my mind just stopped working, I don't have a crafty comeback. Thanks again. Crush #1: Hmm. That's cool too. Take your time. I was heartbroken, but I think it was worth it. It gave me the courage to try and start looking elsewhere for love. After a few weeks I went after Crush #2. This time I was gonna go for the direct approach and start in the DMs with my intentions straight up. And this is how it went down: Crush #2: Lol nice to meet you too. Lol How old are you? Me: I'm 23.. I was about to ask - how about you then I realized it's in your bio ... You're 22 right? Crush #2: Haha yeah, Your dp is deceiving you look really young. Me: Haha I get that a lot and actually have a lot of funny stories because of it .... Which I would gladly tell you over ice cream one of these days. Crush #2: You're so slick its unbelievable. I should tell you now that I have a boyfriend. My hopes and dreams were crushed. I would try to sweet talk her into a date over the phone. Just when I thought I was winning, she blocked my phone number. Haha, jokes on me. Heartbreak once again. Maybe I have the worst of luck but I have tried to follow the advice of Sean Kernan and Gordon Miller time and again. I hope it helps someday. Now I struggle. I have tried dating girls who I have no emotional attachment to. It's a waste of time and I advise the reader of this answer to cease and desist such behavior. It only hurts the other person. I'll stay single for now. Maybe one day I will meet someone who feels the same about me as I do about them. In the meantime, I will write on Quora and hope I get upvotes for my most sincere answers, like this one! The upvotes will mend my broken heart. :D Thank you for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "I know, this answer may get lost in these \u2018100+' answers, but still even after 4 years, I have a lot to say about the only one crush I have ever had in my life!! It all started in my 9th standard, when I entered to a new school van, there was that boy who was friendly with every one, whom even made me to talk( I say this with a lot of excitement, because I had been a introvert, lol!!) Okay now, I slowly started feeling that, he has a crush on me, since he used to stare me, he used to show off in front of me..etc.. btw, since I am kinda introverted, I never befriended him outside the van, also I acted as if I don't know him!! And he had been my senior, okay now, time passed, I started falling for him, I started to feel a different feeling while seeing him, I gradually got to know I was happy near him, and I am growing a liking for him, it was really weird to cop up with those feelings, I knew I cannot confess this to someone else. Seriously I considered loving someone was inhuman (that's what my society taught me) lol!! I expected him the very next year, but I came to know he changed his school, but what really haunt me was, during my vacation the crush feeling inside me grew, and was about to explode\u2026 I couldn't even think of saying it to him or someone else, he always used to say he won't change the school, but he changed!! And I was planning to confess my pain and fears with him. But actually what happened was his friend (let his name be tom{name changed}) fell in love with one of my classmate, and confessed it to her, and they started their relationship, when tom came to see his love he (my crush) used to accompany him. And you can understand repeatedly seeing your crush will not give you a chance to forget him!! Now, after about 7 months of this incident I accidentally got a chance to talk to him, and I understood, he is committed and is on thw way to see her, yeah, I felt like I am drawning to hell, I simply gave him a smile after hearing it, and lol!! I was going to confess my love for him, that would have made an earthquake there!! Now, I studied, passed with a well good marks in my 10th boards (90+) and I moved on to another school, I thought this was the only way I can forget him, I suppose, I was so much in love with him that, I used to think about him each and every minute of my day, actually I was mad with his memories\u2026..I told my new friends about my failed crush, when I was in 12th, my friend started a new insta account , so my friend searched for him in it, and found his blogs\u2026!! Actually the day she told me about his blogs was a heavenly day for me, since, his blog was all about his breakup, I know it must be hard to have gone through that situation, And finding happiness in someone's sorrow is bad, but, I felt like I was the most happiest one, I felt like hgging and kissing my friend. Now fast forward, oneday I thought of messaging my crush through pinterest, my first message was too long(I understood that, I actually don't know how to start or end a conversation, seriously it had been a huge lucture lol!!) Okay but that lucture never contained my crush feelings, it was about his bogs. Now, he asked me if I am messaging the wrong one? I was like, oohh god!! Is it?? But I asked him, in Which school he studied? He told me the name of my former school. I told him, you are the one I wanted to talk with, and I'm with the right person!! He even forgotten my name, but my condition was like, I even remembered every moment with him, That night had been one of my sleepless night!! After that, I made him remember me, I understood if I confess him my love now, he would just push me away, So then I waited I really love to talk to him, And we used to talk every night, He didn't replied so early, but I used to wait for his replies may be for more than half an hour, He started to get fed up with my messages He started asking me questions like where from did I read his blogs,(since I don't have insta and he have never posted his blogs so publicly for me to get an access) Now, I was loaded with questions, that I was forced to tell him, that I loved him once, but I didn't say, that I still have that feeling for him. We used to fight often, and then the problem would be solved within a few days of silence and one day this happened: Him: tell me the truth!! You still love me.. Me: why should I say that to you? Actually I must have said the truth, but I was thinking about my parents, if I start a commitment that would adversely affect our relationship, they have warned me not to start a commitment or stuff, they even don't like me talking with my first cousins(boys). Me: I am waiting to get out of my teen years! Him: then Me: but there is still years to go, yo get out of my teenage Him: do whatever you want Me: ohoo!! Him: love fucks people Me: I don't have any problem Him: I failed in it once, should we? Me: I dunno Our conversation went on\u2026 Next day: Me: I talked about something after sometime Him: go get lost!! Me: what?? (Seen) After sometime, Me: dude!! Him: what? Go, go study!! Me: what happened?? (Seen) After sometime Me: can we be in commitment Him: commitment???what? Me: you asked to me if I wanna start a relationship yesterday?? Him: when? Yesterday?? Me: you asked me Him: I don't remember it Me: what?? (Seen) That day had been a hell day of my life, after so many years of hope and love and stuff, I understood, he don't value my love, he actually took it for granted He used to say, he is not eligible for love and stuff, He used to say he feels like to laugh out loud, when I say I loved him..!! I don't even remember his face, I only know his character he used to have then, I loved him for it, only for his character for 3 long years\u2026 But he said, everything was my assumptions, and I assume a lot of stuffs, He says, his crush on me, that I mentioned earlier too was my assumption lol!! After that, my parents saw our chats, they yelled at me, they lost their trust, My hell life started, and now\u2026I am dipped in sorrow\u2026I don't have dreams, depressed\u2026I wanna die, why should I live, I feel like even my parents don't wanna know my present mental condition, etc.. But something I wanna say, my love for him doesn't end here, it flows like a river which would never dry\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Lucas,consider this. If you ask a woman out on a date, you are confessing that you like her. You may not have a full out erectile Jones on her, but you like her or are attracted to her enough to want to get to know her- Unless you are asking someone out just to make a status statement to your friends. I never confessed to any woman any feelings like having a crush until I got to know her well enough to know that my feelings were grounded in reality. I recall several girls who I knew in high school who I thought were really hot. I wanted them, but I did not have love for them, since my attraction was superficial,from a distance. I asked these girls out on dates and in each case I found that my imagination was hotter than they were. To answer your question more specificaly, I have never confessed to having a crush on a woman who I had not dated or had not gotten to know in some way. Any time I told a woman \u2018I love you\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ve been obsessed with you\u2019., it did not come as a surprise to her. I never just walked up to a female who I was not acquainted with and told her \u2018I love you.\u2019 That always seemed stupid to me. I knew people who had done that. I have had it done to me in the past, and from my perspective, it was a pretty stupid thing. ",

I told her to come over to my dorm and i explicitly toward her that I liked her. She had a surprise look on her face and said \u201cI'm to busy with school and all, but maybe in the future\u201d. In my mind I knew this was some of the excuses that girls pull just let you down easy, but the other half said that there still hope. I said okay and she left. After that she continued to say hi to me and I said hi back. When time preceeded the hellos started to dwindle and I started to panic. I started to become needy and try to start conversation, which was back fire . She gave off signals like she didn't want to talk me. I then backed off and decided to leave her be. I still think about her, but it's probably for the best to move on and meet different people. I'm still hopeful she might come around, but I have learned from this experience and Chase after my goals instead of people for now on. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes of course. I\u2019ll be naming them guy #1 and guy #2 . I named them as such in case they find my Quora. Okay, let\u2019s begin! Allow me to contextualize things first. I transferred schools when I was in second grade. I was bullied, but I was able to befriend some of my classmates. One of them was guy #1. Needless to say, I was infatuated with him. I remember saying to my maid once: \u201cI will follow him whenever he goes.\u201d Well, it is a big dream for a child. As an 8-year-old, I was glad to befriend him because of his nice attitude. Years passed. Then it was senior year of high school! the last year before we walk on different paths. Guy #1 and I are still friends. We talk about video games such as Team Fortress, guns, funny videos, and My Little Pony. Admittedly, I still have a crush on him after all those years. My best friends keep teasing me, and coaxing me to confess to him. I mustered the courage to confess. It\u2019s now or never. I approached him and said: \u201cHey dude! I like you!\u201d I forgot how he reacted, but I think he flinched as soon as those words slipped my mouth. He reciprocated my feelings around 45 minutes later. Did we become a couple? nope. Although Guy #1 said to his friends that we are officially a couple. This is a mistake on his part. We were never a couple, as there was no courtship involved. If ever he decides to court me, then probably he would need to visit my place and talk to my parents for \u201capproval\u201d. It\u2019s okay. I do not think he was ready to be in a relationship in the first place. Even my best friends think he was ready either. At least I went against the status quo (usually it is the guy who confesses first. If the girl confesses first, then she is desperate). That was brave of me to confess. I\u2019m not sure what he is doing now, but I think he is enjoying life.  I met guy #2 when I attended the Model United Nations in the United States. I approached him to let him know his thoughts about my draft resolution. During caucuses, he would approach me and say: \u201cHey Sweden!\u201d I was representing Sweden at that time. As far as memory is concerned, he even commended me during the debate. Or was it the other way around? I\u2019m not sure. My memory is mixed up as I\u2019m writing him. During the diplomatic night, I approached him and had a photo op with him for a memento. I also had a photo op with other delegates. I gave guy#2 my business card. It was on that night when we found out each other\u2019s real names. I did not hear his name properly. His name had a long vowel \u201ca\u201d to it. It was only the long vowel I heard. I returned to the Philippines and tried to search him on Facebook. I used a hashtag, and I saw a man who looked similar to guy #2. I clicked on his profile to check. Cheese sticks! it\u2019s guy #2! At this point, I began to develop a slight crush on him. I sent him a friend request and moved on. He accepted my friend request and sent me a message on December 2016. I know I\u2019m being slow, but I just found that he\u2019s from South Asia! how come I did not notice that when I first checked his profile? It was a short chat. I told a friend about him. He suggested that I should talk to him and see how things will fare. I gladly accepted her suggestion. I wrote a message to guy #2. I was a nervous wreck, I don\u2019t know why. I think this was the point in which my crush for him developed even more. We chat frequently. I was able to know some facts about him. Then I tried the unthinkable, I confessed to him! this was how I confessed: \u201cBelieve it or not: I used to have a crush on you because you were cute and nice. You look cute in glasses admittedly. Hahaha!\u201d This is a little complicated to explain, but my feelings for him are on and off. This explains the words \u201cused to\u201d. Notice that I usually like people wearing glasses. I began to notice a trend- our chat was not so frequent as it was before. I found out from Facebook that he was married to a woman. I was happy for him, admittedly. May his married life be filled with everlasting love and blessings. ",

I had a close guy friend that I developed a crush on and after much prodding by other friends I finally told him I liked him as more than just a friend one evening at his place. He told me he didn\u2019t feel the same and explained that after what his ex-gf had done he also was not ready for a relationship. We both cared more about maintaining a friendship than anything else. We talked and hung out for a bit longer, and did actually fool around a little in the middle there too, then I went home. I didn\u2019t see him after that night for a bit due to school breaks and it was a little awkward for the first or second time we hung out again after that. It took about 1\u20131.5 weeks of being back in the same town before our friendship was completely normal again and I was over him after confessing. Even though we knew what happened, and many other friends knew I finally told him, we all kinda acted like it didn\u2019t happen and just moved on with our lives. ",

Like he steal my wallet(i use boy's cardholder as wallet) and keep it with him, take me for coffee just to tease me, I used to stick WANTED posters on office wall.. Yeah we were like Tom and Jerry. But.. The moment I overheard that his family is not agreeing with him to marry his girlfriend, I crushed my heart for him.. \u2665 We had a lot of lovely moments like, once I was running to metro, I was near to door, he was inside(he lived one station away from mine) couldn't open it. We met in office and fought like cat n dog :p.. When ever I go in my red lace top, he stare at me.. Oh cutu.. The day I was traveling back to India, he ran to me and said sorry, he was in meeting, I just said sorry is not accepted but my soul hugged him tight and said man I love you!! Haa whatever\u2026 after reaching India, I put many whatsapp statuses to make him ping me and he did.. We fought again like Tom n Jerry in whatsapp chat..even he enquired me whether I have a boyfriend, if not find one and fight with him.. I thought he is building up to propose me.. Yeah I am an Idiot :p. So today he pinged me, out of blue, Hey! I danced here, imagined he will tell I love you and rehearsed replies in brain.. Me: hello! And kept on checking is he coming online or not.. I saw he came online many times but didn't respond to me.. So I confirmed he is nervous to express it!! Yeah call me idiot 2 times now.. Then comes his message: \u201cI am getting married \u201d I was shocked!! I overlooked alot that I forgot what to reply!! 10..9..8..7\u2026\u2026..3..2..1 He said finally their family agreed, after 3 years of fight! I congratulate him from bottom of my heart because MY CRUSH IS HAPPY MEANS I AM HAPPY (crying inside) All happened just as hour ago, came to Quora for a relief but Sigh!! Quora also wanna know about my crush :(  I thought to add screenshot, but what if it goes till him.. Now I am friend zoning him :p don't wanna get embarrassed like hell!! ",

But he did not pick up, he was busy at that time. Then a few hours later, he called me back, and I told him that I liked him very much, I wanted to stop that feeling. He rejected me politely and still sweet. We still talk sometimes, I still like him but it\u2019s not tiring anymore. It\u2019s become interesting.

But that\u2019s not what all what happened one of my good friends was very obvious of flirting with him and talking to him. And it was just really annoying.

And I remembered I write in my diary that I liked him. Normal right? But then, this one girl in my class asked me to see the content of my diary. I refused, of course. But she always pressure me to give her my diary. It became so annoying. So I gave her my diary, and asked her to promise not tell anybody what is inside the diary. She said she promised. She lied. Some time later, the whole class knows. I realized that the girl actually break the promise. Now my crush knows I like him. I never expected him to like me back, but I never expect him to hate me so much! He would always avoid me, ignore me, and if I remember correctly, I think he is disgusted by me. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s embarassed that I like him. ",

            "answer_text": "Sit down, children, and you shall hear the most awkward story of Paul Revere. So, here I am with my best friend in my freshman year of high school, \"Karen.\" Our school had two sets of stairs near the left side of the campus, one set coming down from the main gym, the second coming off of a small exit right next to the gym. We would sit on the second set of stairs, because it has the best view of the campus's relatively forested inner landscape. It was rather beautiful, but we didn't keep it for long. The next week, a sophomore couple making out took our spot. We were slightly annoyed and yelled \"get a room!\" jokingly. The girl, \"Julia\", and the guy, \"David\", both turned to us. Julia had a permanent snooty look on her face, and accordingly sneered at us. David gave us a blank, yet focused look. He was very handsome, though. He was a dirty blonde rugby jock who I had seen a lot around. Deep, piercing blue eyes, the cutest freckles, slightly pointed canines like a sexy wolverine, with a perfect swimmer's build. Sweat-inducing description aside, the next day, they weren't there and we took the spot again. They came back later in the period and saw us; David rose his eyebrows slightly and walked on, while Julia gave her characteristic sneer and then narrowed her eyes at us. The next day, they took the larger steps coming out of the main gym for lunch. We had our spot back, so we stopped thinking about David and Julia. Freshman year passed. As eighth-graders, Karen and I had taken French I online, so we were able to be in French II during 9th grade, and now French III during 10th grade. Now, since everyone *had* to take 2 years of a language to graduate, French I and French II were artificially packed with about 30+ people, but French III was 10\u201325, and AP French famously had about 5 students. Our teacher, Madame, now that we had more room for everyone, liked mixing us around regularly. That's when I saw David again\u2014-with a black eye. This is odd, but I didn't think black eyes were *actually* something that happened. I thought that they were primarily a visual technique used in popular media to emphasize eye injuries and abrasions. He didn't try to hide it. Anyway, he was rather quiet and was moved from a table of attractive rugby players to a table of four, with a nice goth girl named Angeline, Karen, myself, and David. Mme preferred equal gender division, hence two boys and two girls. We started chatting casually. I assumed he would be some blockhead jock, but after some initial awkwardness about his black eye, wherein he explained he ran into an opposing player during some sort of drill, we started talking about the book he was reading. It was some Chomsky tome critiquing American hegemony, and we talked about American geopolitical history for the rest of the period. Karen, David, and I quickly became friends, but it was obviously that they were becoming a *bit* closer. I was very jealous, but I, for one, wasn't out and wasn't going to entrust some boy I didn't know very well with my secret, and two, I initially didn't want to be a homebreaker. You might ask why Karen, and I later, didn't mind flirting with a committed guy? Well, here's the detour: Back in their early sophomore year, Julia and David began dating; like many petty high school relationships, it was primarily based on sex. The usual Personality-wise, David found in Julia a sort of wallflower quirkiness with her own fire. Julia found a submissive, cute jock that she could dominate. Given more attention, as they matured together, Julia came out of her shell to emerge as a guilt-inducing emotional dictator. Try as he might, David quickly became emotionally drained from her and subsequently ran out of care for her. However, she wouldn't let go, using all of her manipulative powers to hold him by his balls. So...he cheated on her. He cheated with two girls he was relatively close to, some rugby guys, and had a few miscellaneous hookups. You'd think that Julia would be at least a *little* angry and embarrassed as the rumor mill started churning, but, in fact, her best friend, Samantha, had started aggressively hitting on her. Julia wasn't bi, but she craved emotional attention since David started glazing over after she showed her true colors. Julia, having her emotional energy drained by Sam, could only sustain her husk of a relationship with David through guilt and sex. The decreasing marginal returns for her led to David cutting her off during the beginning of his junior year, when he started dating Katie, an artistic hippie who mirrored his own charisma in a uniquely feminine way. At any rate, Karen and David started moving closer. She started showing me their budding flirtatious text conversations, and I resolved myself to squash my jealousy and be a good friend and wingman. There were some problems that they had, though. David had quite a few mental problems that he and I have only fully understood in the last few months. He had borderline personality disorder from parental neglect(he was a stoner who used weed, sex, and Nietzschean existentialism to escape his emotional abandonment-engulfment cycles, as well as significant erraticism.) and complex-PTSD from being sexually abused multiple times by one of his mom's boyfriends during childhood. And so, David wanted-no, needed a benevolent/playful dom to be his partner to satisfy what he and i call his \"Oedipenis.\" A semi-absent mother figure led him to crave an unconditionally loving dominant partner. Yet, due to his fear of being emotionally overwhelmed/engulfed, he made the mistake of choosing quiet wallflowers, who seemed passionate and benevolently dominant, but were secretly abrasive without sufficient social power. He does this a lot. With his friends, from insecure passive-aggressive nerds to frequently socially ignored guitarists to lanky stoners who are slowly figuring out that downing more protein shakes won't fix their low self-esteem to girls with severe daddy issues to extroverted pragmatists who are slowly figuring out that living out the sexual dysfunction \"Shameless\" won't bring them love, he acts as the mediator, because he subconsciously believes that if he can care for everybody else unconditionally, they will care for him back and not hurt, abandon, or engulf him. Yet, see my TL;DR. He has the same problem that I do. We are both stuck in everlasting struggles. He has aired out his social stress multiple times to me. *sigh* Now, I was really good friends with Karen, but she was too defensive and reliant on others' dominant initiative in a romantic/sexual relationship. Such different starting places, he a neglected stoner who suddenly found the nectar of sex to fix his low self-esteem once puberty and protein powder got through with him, and she a smothered upper-class scene girl, but both seeking the same kind of person...*SIGH*. Obviously deeply incompatible, but I was sublimating my feelings for David vicariously through Karen, so I put on my Machiavellian thinking cap and put in a little elbow grease. This is the immoral tidbit. I decided to help David \"develop initiative\" and help Karen \"be more benevolently dominant\" by sending each other specific screenshots of my conversations with them. I would get David texts that showed that Karen would immediately respond as soon as he emotionally affirmed her a *little more.* I would show Karen that based on his increased affirmation, he wanted her to respond a bit more \"benevolently dominant.\" They both took the catnip, and they vastly progressed in their relationship, so much so that their \"love\" was able to gloss over the fundamental incompatibility. Now, I knew this situation was inherently unsustainable, but I wanted them to get closure with each other first. Eventually, Karen found some screenshots of her texts on my phone(ask people to not swipe if you show them something on your camera roll!) and ratted me out to David. They froze me out, but I still talked to them on an acquaintance basis few and far between. Without my stabilizing and catalyzing influence, their romantic/sexual relationship slowly iced over. They didn't really remain friends, but relapsed into civil acquaintances. I decided that I was acting immaturely by staying quiet, so I reached out to them separately, and slowly rebuilt my friendship with both of them, even as they solidly remained icy for a long time. This was at the end of David's senior year, and after a year and junior prom with Katie, he ended up dating Julia again for his last year, and, with limited time to fix anything, they utterly fell apart aside from random bouts of sex. They both left for different states. That was May 2017, and that fall, I started my senior year. Iced away still from Karen and David, I was relatively quiet on both fronts. The second semester started, and during the first week of January 2018, David sent out multiple texts from a new number saying that he had changed his number. Every since that Chomsky conversation, we have both had jokingly political conversation, him being an anarcho-syndicalist, but we joke about him being a primitivist hermit, and me always being a committed communist. We talked about Nietzsche's pithy statement about how one's biography determines their life philosophy, and how his free-spirited nature led to his more left-libertarian stance, and my own stiff immigrant upbringing led to my own strict communism. This led into speaking about weed, which weirdly ended up one February night in us talking about our sexual exploits. I was still scared to out myself to him, but we happened to chance upon his gay rugby exploits in our conversation, which I hadn't known about beforehand. I weighed the odds, and I decided that there was a negligible chance that he'd reveal my secret if I just told him, so I decided to just be open. It worked out, gladly. He was happy that I was open with him, and we swapped our \"conquest\" stories. We continued talking about anything and everything, from the intersection of modernism with Goedel's incompleteness theorem to masturbating to each other in the past to politics to tech and our childhoods and our personal psychoanalyses. We talked for hours every day over text and frequently called for hours in the evening. I know, I know, the soothing effect of some odd actualization of my long-repressed crush was probably subsidizing problems I couldn't see that I was rushing hundreds of miles per hour into an open maw. From Feb-May, the romantic ante was constantly upped, and we started having skirmishes about where we were going emotionally. Initially, he'd be hesitant, considering how hurt he was by Rachel, but he'd still brazenly flirt with me. He talked about not trusting me yet, and then oscillating again into saying he did have feelings for me. By mid-May, he said he was coming back to my city to visit family during the second week of June. He grew readily more confident, and amidst completely unrelated conversation during one of our night calls, he said he had definite romantic feelings for me and he wanted to plan a \"friendly outing\" when he got back. This made me internally giddy, but, ever the stoic rationalist, I responded with a moderate and not overwhelming amount of joy. It was confusing, but asking him in a forthright manner led to him saying he was generally just confused about the nature of his feelings due to his failed relationships, but he did want to start to engage and flirt with me, which I had been doing all along. I've asked him how he knew his feelings were legitimate. He cheated on so many people. Why wouldn't he cheat on me if we did grow closer? He replied by saying that even without physicality, I had been there for him intellectually and emotionally.(This was sort of obvious, seeing as he only initiates with broken people as a therapist, but our organic situation had no D/S dynamic.) \"I've never been present during sex with women, and other guys are usually callous, closeted, or cold.\" Months of interpersonal analysis led to us figuring out that he was just gay, and the women always fulfilled some need. Now, I know the skeptic's soapbox well, and I know it seems like I might be so inundated with my puppy love that I was at his mental hand and foot that he was just enjoying the level of control he had over me, but, again, I am ever the stoic rationalist. I have, I do, and I will enthusiastically criticize and discuss anything with anyone, and my passion ends where irrationality starts. We have definitely dipped and risen many times. Sappy bullshit aside, I think he just wanted an equal. Hedonism with his newfound desirability was all fine and dandy, but that didn't cover up the parental neglect or abuse. The only sustainable way to have perpetual and self-contained happiness is family values. Obviously not the homophobic, regressive brand of \"family values\" we all know and love, but the sense of community, loyalty, and altruism that usually exists in a nuclear family, but can just as easily be created within a band of lifelong friends or a polyamorous BDSM commune. A family is composed of self-supporting and inter-supporting equals having unconditional love for one another, and David has been screwed over by, well, everyone. It's odd, but I think that I am the first person who has ever actually expected some degree of mutual respect from him. Among most people, he was this charismatic rugby jock with a brilliant mind and a gleaming smile, a big man on campus who must be venerated, to his friends, in many ways, he was their emotional leader and idol, and in the context of his divorced parents, he was an insignificant kid who they didn't consider when breaking up. But seeing him as a person and insisting that he see me as a person as well...it may very well be the first relationship he had ever been in that was between equals. Borderline people usually display a deep lack of self-awareness, but I think I forced him to consider the moral responsibility of being a functional emotional adult. I chose to believe that, since I am deeply compatible with him in almost every way, from sharing interests on anthropology, philosophy, blacksmithing, physical activity, relationships, a variety of miscellaneous hobbies, and more. We always organically meeting in the middle, and, as you can tell by now, I'm certainly long-winded enough and perhaps substantive enough to talk about everything. However, we still had regular issues, primarily about trust and fear of the other, but a night of cathartic conversation resolved everything every time. June came, and with the sweltering heat came the increasing heat in both of our nether regions. Sexting grew more frequent. Then the day came. I removed any blackheads, double-showered, and then I saw him for the first time for over a year. We went walking in our local park, and a general mix of low-tier apprehension and joy dominated(retroactively confirming) both our minds. We got to a tiny grotto next to a bridge, and I remembered how serene the bridge was during a past phone call with him. Overcome with emotion, I went in and kissed him. It was pretty intense for me, and he was obviously aroused, as he went in for tongue, which was a first for me, but i attempted to match his moves. He must be very experienced, I thought. My schizoid traits make me overly analytical, though, as I kept my eyes open. We then continued walking until he grabbed my shoulder and asked me to follow him; we ended up in this meadow blocked from the path's view, and mild oral and vigorous making out ensued. After that, we went back to his car, and he started telling me about a once-off fling with an old friend(female) and having parallel-romantic feelings for her. That made me feel bad, but I didn't want to ruin the tenor of the date. The day ended, and when I got home, I sent him a few romantic texts, and when he didn't respond that night(he went out to reconnect with some friends; I'm not trying to be a jailer, as how I feel is not his responsibility.), I remembered the fling he talked about, and how he used to have a harem of cheerleader girls, and now seemed like he was trying to subconsciously groom me to be part of some hyper-manipulative neo-harem now that he was trying out his gay side, and I remembered how he blocked me out for months when I tried to be honest with him and Karen. He just never seemed to respect me, and no matter how direct I was, he would never truly be himself, as happy as he was. So, I just stopped talking to him. I got into a rut of overworking and engaging more in my hobbies to just get away from him. And then the switches flipped, as he'd text me, e-mail me, and call me incessantly about how much he wanted me in his life and how much he wanted to talk to me, if only briefly. A month later, I accidentally butt-texted him, and he jumped on the text immediately. I'm obsessed with logical consistency(daddy issues; my parents wouldn't care about my input or respect my agency where it was important and where my siblings got respect, so I believed if I only spoke in terms of logical order, they couldn't invalidate my words, because the onus would be on the validity of my facts and not on how high they valued my opinion), and so I sought to apologize for the accident. He may have misconstrued my words as me being ready to speak on romantic terms again, but I remained icy for a few days, but he has this way of making me feel grounded and happy, so within the next few days, I semi-formally asked him to be my boyfriend. He agreed with his usual easy mirth, and the rest of July was identical to our prior romantic months, but he would engage more by proactively sending me fun memes and strong insights every morning. I sublimated my jealousy into productive curiosity, and we learned more about each other, that he had borderline adaptations and I had schizoid adaptations, and that he had been sexually abused by one of his mom's string of boyfriends in eighth grade, and, as such, he was co-morbid with complex PTSD as well. Everything seemed to be getting worse and better at the same time, but it all came to a head last August, wherein it was just more work for him, but I started college, and he completely did a 180 and said he wanted to just be friends, and he just retreated into his shell and more or less rejected me, not responding to anything, and when I got stressed out and asked for an explanation, he blocked me. I sent an e-mail just to confirm the block(it was at night) wasn't just a glitch and to let out all my feelings, and he shortly unblocked me, going back and forth on blocking about nine times from August to October, wherein I became progressively more depressed, and he oscillated between hurtfully comparing me to his caustic ex and then growing softer whilst reminiscing about our good times. A little before my birthday in late October hit, he released his pressure and apologized for his past three months of behavior, attributing his behavior to intense paranoia related to Julia and a feeling of replicative abuse of his neglectful and divorced parents, as well as his rapist. Shortly after this, I got into a car crash and received a concussion. I spiraled when I read a Reddit post on r/gaybros that I thought was him, and I told him my fear about his old friend and his trust issues and our collective neuroses in general. He got into his tribal mediator mode and said that he had confirmed he was gay, and that the dissociating sex with women was a borderline defense mechanism to try to attain attention from a strong female, i.e. mommy issues. There was a lot of talking about how nuanced and caring I was and how he cherished my mental intensity even in the emotional moments when his exes or friends would have disparaged or ignored him. It did console me, and November and December were perfect in their romantic feeling. As Winter Break pulled closer and David was planning a holiday visit, we planned to get a hotel room for a night. A week before our meeting, he told me about feeling nauseated every few months when he thought about how he hurt the girls in his past harem, and I pushed him to resolve his issues with Julia by unblocking her and directly texting her. He did, promptly came out to her, told her who he was dating, and they made a date to see each other. He was fantastically happy to finally get closure, and she only reacted positively, but the next morning, there was a twist. He told me about having recurrent sexual feelings for her and then how he wanted to maintain an open relationship. I have nothing against poly people, but...not for me. I just said that if he is obligate poly(as opposed to facultative), then we could just be friends. He became panicky and scared, and then he internalized the shame and stopped talking to me. I then called him; he said he prioritized me and wanted monogamy, and we came to a consensus of polyamory being his mode of weakening intimacy, so he wouldn't feel emotionally engulfed, i.e. borderline defense mechanism. This seemed tenable for the time being, but then we met up on January 1st. Part of the whole submission-to-women complex used to involve oscillating with trans feelings and crossdressing desires. Julia used to dress him up in her skirts, panties, and/or lingerie whilst she would use a strapon on him. Part of the date was going to be going to this lingerie shop downtown, subsequently buying some books and getting coffee. My little kinky existentialist(too bad I'm a thorough modernist), lol. Yet, I suddenly stopped getting text responses the morning of. I called him multiple times, received no response, and with a curious dismissal, I slowly paled into the realization that he got cold feet. Ha! My hedonistic womanizer, nervous of me, some random short guy, and not his aggressively dominant exes and ruthless friends? Maybe he didn't want me anymore. Who ignores someone when they're frantic for months(after the Karen crisis) or after uninterrupted bliss(last July)? I knew there had to be some catch to getting the perfect guy. I mean, who gets their straight hunky crush to fall in love with them, have deeply engaging conversation with them on all levels without end in sight, come out with them, and go through so much simultaneous growth? That's every young gay guy's erstwhile dream. Who was I, a try-hard nerdy guy, to get such a perfect partner right at the exact cusp of my budding adulthood? I am not unconfident, but, seriously, this scenario was almost textbook perfect. Even the current emotional turmoil...most likely, it will be solved by his seeing my honest and caring face most days. A growth arc for us both...argghhh! All the perfect ingredients, but what if I've destroyed everything forever? What if I came on too strong and he knows I want him to be my boyfriend and now he's just too scared of disappointing me? Our senses of shame seem to throttle each other. He doesn't want to disappoint anyone, so he just leaves(abandoned children can always escape); I don't want to disappoint anyone, so I just create a logical paradigm to understand, if not control, everything(youngest child has no escape, but all the expectations and legacies, so the only answer is to always be better than yourself). Why can't he just understand that I love him without conditions? I wish he could understand that he makes me smile and explode with mirth, even now, whilst rereading his old texts. As an intensely private person, it was an accomplishment when he proactively sent me a nude whilst we were sexting late at night, which was the first time he'd ever taken one, aside from the one begrudgingly extracted from him from Julia. Anyhow, he finally called me back at 2pm, and said he was unsure he could be in a relationship, explicating with commitment and trust issues fundamentally rooted in the insecurities of the problems of the prior week. I mentioned those prior issues, telling him how I felt about them(that I believed monoamory and monogamy were separate, and when we were relatively settled without dynamic drama, we seemed to be fully content with each other, and that I was there for him, whatever decision he decided to make), and then he felt emboldened enough to drive up to my college campus, wherein we just walked around, had cathartic conversation about the same issues, but with a greater measure of credibility levied to me, due to him seeing my face and hearing me directly. The clincher for him, before he looked at me directly, eyes softening and narrowing, grabbed my shoulders, and started violently making out with me, was a little bit of object relations theory. He mentioned frequently about even when we were not speaking, he thought so much about me constantly, and even when he was angry at me, it was about how stressful my mental ubiquity seemed to be. I mentioned the part-object, that he could easily dissociate from sex with his \"girlfriends\", his summer fling with his old friend included, or see hookups with other guys as purely visceral action, friends included, which fundamentally gave every person a mental time limit. We were infinitely perpetuating, because our puzzle pieces of minds regenerated enthusiasm at every instance, and my so-called womanizer denied sex with me when he thought I was disappointed in his \"polyamorous desires\", i.e. when he thought i was disappointed in him. It was never about a part of me, whether it was my firebrand philosophizing, immigrant quirks, or my intellectual and emotional honesty, or my annoying anxiety, for that matter. He would bring up Jungian type theory, and whenever I'd describe my experiences, he'd talk about a compatible type, and over time, he broke multiple orthodox models by sending me articles and memes and walls of texts and information over calls to justify being an INFP, not the type I'm theoretically most compatible with, but the type closest in compatibility to my spoken experiences. Quite the whole-object relation. That night was perfect. We grew horny enough to end up blowing each other, then realized the time, and he drove me home, but parked on the street over from mine, turning off his lights, landing us in the pitch black darkness. I could glimpse his nervous and rare smile gleaming in the briefest moment of moonlight, and he proceeded to leap over the gear shift over my lap, and before I knew it, the blissfully warm electricity of his lips touched me again and we made out again. Finally, he drove me over to my street, but one house before it. Blah, blah, blah, we made out a bit again and I left, for him to go off to a night party with his friends. The next day, we went to a cheesy hotel downtown at 4 in the afternoon. We took a Lyft, because his car was in the shop, and I remember exchanging a smirk with David as our driver made a semi-serious joke about a local sorority staying at the hotel as well that night. Anyhow, we checked in, started talking, got naked, and started making out. I was going to go down on him, but he had the pubes of a wildebeest and I asked him if I could trim them. He let me, and when it got to a certain level, I asked to shave the rest. He got antsy about that, so I gave up on it, and we walked back to the bed from the bathroom, wherein I almost tackled him to the ground playfully. He didn't want to, went back to bed, and gave me the whole \"confusion\" spiel, I started asking questions, we dissected the situation, and he jumped on me again. However, when I got out the sex toys we agreed we might use, he got antsy again. I took this as a sign to go slower, but even just making out and talking for an hour and a half made him feel antsy about prior events. The night was lost to my schizoid paranoia and his borderline shame. From 4pm to 4am, we just talked constantly and went back and forth. I retroactively take our ability to discuss productively even these intensely messy situations as a sign of possible long-term relationship. We both ended up masturbating to go to bed, and ever the aggressive one, I sucked him off a bit and swallowed his cum, in memory of a fantasy he elaborated upon the previous November 16that 11:53pm my time, 12:53am his time. I partially didn't want to see if he'd emotionally oscillate too much if I stuck my dick in his mouth(mind you, he had asked me to fuck him about eight times that night already), so I ended up just masturbating by myself, but, in the dark, I accidentally ended up jizzing all over his abdomen, and I'm sure he spiraled a bit as he got up and went to clean himself in the shower(we had both edged for ten days beforehand, hence a very large buildup of cum and invariably constantly high libido, and that's considering we are both boys in our late teens.). I swiftly fell asleep on my side of the bed, but, in the middle of the night, whether it was accidental or not, I felt him hugging me a little bit briefly(I'm a very light sleeper.). I sighed, realized all would be well, and fell into a deeper sleep. I woke up early, organized all our things, took a shower, brushed my teeth, and waited on my phone as he went through his motions. He looked despondently out the window as he got dressed, and I playfully made an analogy about the origins and mechanism of bleak existentialism as opposed to my modernism, and this encouraged him enough to kiss me, but he then moved his face away in pain. Clearly, he had internalized his shame again and I was now months away from an answer. As we rode back in the Lyft, I typed out a message essentially saying \"Before you leave the cab, blink at me if you know me, if you know us and our love. Our trust, our resilience, our nuance, and our solidarity against a bleak universe of sorrow we are both feeling right now.\", as we couldn't exactly spell out romantic drama in front of some random driver, much less gay drama. He did blink, but that was all I heard from him for a week and a half. For the next semester, every month, we'd speak for a few days, he'd want to get back together, but then I'd ask too many questions, he'd absorb my curiosity as fatherly aggressive disappointment, internalize the shame, and then retreat for another month. I initially came out to him thinking I would never see him again, and then it grew into more. We had fantasies of going to close professional schools together eventually. I'm pre-med and he's either going to go into Bio/Anthro with a later clinical psych PhD or Special Forces if his low self-esteem drives him to further \"Self-transcendent\" behavior. Think Cloninger. He's a nerd at heart who uses Nietzschean tactics to get into jock circles. Oddly brilliant. However, I convinced him last November to move back to our home city, he managed a full ride, and now he will be back permanently in early June. He's now visiting his mother in these last two weeks before his return. I hope it will be cathartic, as the essential role of the neglectful mother is the core of his borderline personality disorder, his \"Oedipenis\". (It's always so odd how he's so much gayer(his female \"desire\" doesn't really exist outside of his neurotic episodes. An easy high due to feeling desirable without feeling overwhelmed, because he doesn't really like girls. Think about how most gay guys find it odd that straight guys are uncomfortable asking out girls, and how said gays would find it easy to date girls just to hang out, but then add in David's neurotic/borderline \"self-transcendent\" behavior, which amplifies such platonic experience into sexual validation. The need for validation is the solution to his disorder, but my logical nature presupposes that if I talk to you at all, I necessarily respect you and consider your words of value. Would you actively encourage anyone in a normal situation? If you don't make a big fuss out of small achievements, and even be completely nonchalant about huge ones, then it's as if you have an immense level of respect for said person's competence. I wouldn't congratulate a 40-year-old mathematician for acing a middle school geometry test. I fundamentally consider most compliments outside of almost objectively huge accomplishments to be patronizing. I don't care how brilliant you are, a Nobel Prize or Fields Medal deserves massive congratulations, obviously.) when he's mentally settled.) Maybe he will return. He is always the proactive one for large comebacks. I just wish he could understand how I felt about him. But I won't hold my breath. I'm glad he won't see this. I'll keep a stiff upper lip and just be calmer and take everything in my stride when he comes back. I just hope he ever talks to me again. I feel so empty and sad all the time, no matter what I do, whether it's work or reading or playing around or hanging out with other friends. TL;DR: I'm scared of what I term \"aggressive\" people, which conditions me to tending towards meek people who never take the initiative to support me when I need it, I then grow bored of their non-action, blame it on myself, then I leave, and I have recycled the same process for my entire life. When my family construct was particularly falling apart due to my siblings growing up and my parents getting on in age, I fell into a meaningless limbo, and this oh so perfectly intersected with my first crush, who happened to be a meek and moderately mentally ill dreamboat who pushed all my pain and pleasure buttons at once. I am currently trying to piece it all together. I think being a schizoid makes understanding his BPD all the harder, but is romance with borderline people even sustainable, Asbjorn? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I sure did. Rewind to last year 19th may. We had just finished giving our CA IPCC exams and finally meet after I receive a call from her at around 6 pm telling me to meet today itself. We had postponed meeting for quite few times.(Mostly from my end. Something or other came up) So when we met we were sitting on our vehicles talking about everything and anything. Topic shifted from how the exams were to have you watched that movie? We discussed from our favorite poetry to recommend each other our favorite songs. At some point she returned the books I had lend her. Stars were discussed and so were dreams. No one knew how much time had gone by untill her mom called and asked her when was she coming home and we saw the time and it was past 10 pm. We had been talking for more than 3 hours. And I realised it was time to go home. Time to not be with her and something inside me did not feel right and I said it. I confessed about me having a crush and about how much I liked her. To be exact my words were, \" you know it's crazy that just a few days back I was telling my friend that I kinda like this girl and sort of have a crush on her\" Oh and did I tell you that in the very beginning when we met that day she told me that she is going to another city like shifting permanently and that city is like 1300 km away from where I stay and she was shifting early morning of the very next day. So yeah I confessed my crush to a girl who was shifting to another city in less than 10 hours with no certainty when I'll see her again. If I see her again. And I can say it's the best decision I made. P.S: I am meeting her next month after one and half year when I travel to her city. ",

            "answer_text": "Write a note and pass it to your crush or make a creative card. Notes are one of the most common and effective ways to confess a crush. It tends to be less awkward than in-person confessions, giving you some space and comfort if the person doesn't feel the same way. Write a short note confessing your crush, and pass it to the person in person, or put it in their locker. Make sure your note is hand-written, legible, and relatively short and to the point. It doesn't need to be clever, or overly romantic. Just cut to the chase: \"I've always noticed that you seem really sweet, kind, and cute. I'd love to get to know you better, because I really like you.\" When you want to confess to your crush, in person is always better than just over a text, or online. A note is a good balance, because it can be personal, but also gives you some space if you're nervous. If all else fails, having a conversation on the phone, or via Skype is always preferable to texting it. Introduce the idea without saying anything. In some cases, your actions can make your crush more obvious than saying, \"You know, I really like you.\" If your crush gradually becomes aware that you like them, it'll be more natural and clear than having to say so bluntly. Go out of your way to talk to your crush and \"accidentally\" bump into them in the hallway. Change your routes so you see them regularly, and always make a point of saying hi. Always make eye-contact. Don't shy away from it, like you're embarrassed. Make eye contact and smile flirtatiously when you see the person you're crushing on. Show an interest in what they do and what they are like. Try to get to know your crush as a friend first, before you confess anything. It may grow naturally. Ask for help with something. One great way to start a conversation or to get your crush talking is to ask some help with something simple. Depending on who your crush is and what they're like, this can get you into some flirtatious conversations. Ask for help with a homework assignment for a class that you're in together. Start with a compliment, like, \"You seem so smart in this class. Do you think we could talk a little sometime about this assignment? I need some help.\" Asking for help will make them think respectfully of you, and they'll think you're honest enough to ask for help on something. Also, them helping you will make their overall feelings for you kinder. Pretend you lost something. \"Hey, have you seen a book around here? I just had it...\" When your crush helps out, say, \"You're so sweet...\" ",

I wrote a poem instead. But after the last exam, I decided to tell her how I felt - Me: Hey, I wanted to you something. I have had a huge crush on you since the first day of class and I wrote a poem about you. Crush: What the heck? You're joking right? Me: Nope, every single word is true. I wanted to give you the poem. Crush: That's really sweet, but aren't you dating X? Me: Yeah I am, but I still think that you deserve to know.  Honestly, I felt a lot more comfortable opening up because I knew that at the point she didn't have a shot with me, so I didn't expect an answer or anything. It just felt nice to make someone happy.

            "answer_text": "Confessing to your crush by telling them you love them can turn out good or ugly. There\u2019s a saying which says \u2018do the right thing at the right time\u2019. The atmosphere and timing of when to profess your love for your crush is important. Let me break it down; If you tell them at the wrong time such as when he/she isn\u2019t feeling the same way, or when they are in a really bad mood or when they have pressings issues to attend, it could turn out ugly. Also the atmosphere is very important. You don\u2019t want to profess your love to your crush when they are in the midst of their friends, oh mine! It could be very embarrassing. You also don\u2019t want to tell them when they are with their parents or guardian, don\u2019t attempt it. You can invite your crush to dinner, a picnic or any event that would be really nice. Talk gently and before you know it that opportunity to say it will come naturally and you can tell him/her. I bet there\u2019s much more chance things will go well. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "I will suggest one thing about crushing on someone\u2026 never ever confess. Reason will be clear soon. I had or I can say I still have a big crush on someone to whom I can never confess as there isnt even a slight possibility of being in a relationship. Still that crush makes me do things that usually anyone will do in love..and it has been great, it has made me become a better person. In my imagination my crush is just a perfect individual, smart, intelligent, poetic , sporty, diplomat( which he indeed is..). I get to chat with him once every year and that is enough for me. He doesnt even has a slight hint of me having a big crush on him. The best part of this one sided love is that its just makes me feel I am in love..with no expectation..I always want him to be happy and its a very nice feeling. Secondly I had a crush on someone whom I confessed..and kind of started being in a relationship..but after a while I had started to feel.. he is not what I had thought of him to be..there were differences and even if he was quite a nice guy we were not meant for each other and ended our relationship within a year.. So if you feel for someone let that feeling alive..it will transform you. If you confess , there are two possibilities you will end up being in a relationship if the crush has same feelings for you, which is good for some time..but not as good as loving unconditionally.You might lose even the frienship as well..which you can never afford.",

We would talk during recess and he would clear all my doubts about physics. He would patiently listen to me when i blabbed about how few teachers are impartial towards students who dont take their tutions. Every question i scored less in exam for, he would explain me what was supposed to be the answer(If i asked). He would guide me for my future endeavours while i stared at him in complete awe. Finally, after graduation ceremony, i told him that i liked you. What he told next completely broke my heart. He said,\u201dEven i really like you. Tu mere beti jesi hai(You are like my daughter)\u201d After thanking him, i left and never thought about him till this moment. Heart break all over again !!!!! P.S: He was my physics teacher. Also, never fall for your teachers. It never ends well. ",

Makes matters worse I didn't findout she also had a huge thing for me before I left my job where we used to work together. And I never got her contact either I mean we had chances but again not brave enough..\u2026. It sucks now because she's with some guy and now been with him for 3 years... I still leave comments on her social media and she likes some of my comments but never initiates any conversations. And that's how that story goes for now\u2026 I hope this answers your question. Good luck and God bless on your situation PS. does her liking my comments on social media. mean anything? ",

X tells another friend \u2018y\u2019 who my crush is after I steal her cookie. Y looks at my crush and says \u201cyou\u2019re Charles\u201d. It hasn\u2019t hit him yet. Later I tell X about what happened because I\u2019m mad at her for telling Y about my crush. Ya know what her reaction is? First she laughed. Then she laughed harder. Then she, in front of at least 100 of my classmates, screams to my crush \u201cLILLY LIKES YOU HAHAHAHAHA\u201d  I almost became I murderer that day. Luckly, my crush\u2019s awesome so he figures that as long as I don\u2019t get all flirty and girly (which I wasn\u2019t gonna anyway because that\u2019s weird) we can still be friends. So yeah, we chill. I\u2019ll always be somewhat p*ssed at X though :P ",

Do you have a girlfriend?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes\u201d and we both smiled from our souls, so tickled that I was bold enough to ask and I guess he was flattered as hell! Yay for him, right LOL. We did not know each other so it was not a personal connection but it was a beautiful interaction only tho for a moment :). I love moments like that.

She was a beautiful girl inside and out. One year she spent Christmas eve in the city feeding the homeless, a wonderful woman. Me? I was in town getting shit-faced. The reason I never told her was because the age gap was significant, some 20 years. She was around 24 and I'm 42 (although a young 42 year old physically and at heart). Also if she'd rejected me or reacted badly it would have been torture having to see her all the time. Eventually she left, I was on leave at the time, I was crushed. I still don't know where she went or why and I don't want to know, it would just depress me. On the wall at work there are photographs of staff members and their role/position. When I walk past it I find myself with a sad heart glimpsing at the empty space where her photo used to be. I think if I ever see her again in future years I may tell her how I felt back then, because it won't really matter anymore and I would want her to know. ",

But I told him I like him over the summer and he said ok like it was nothing and didn\u2019t really give a clear answer. Then my sophomore year began. And that\u2019s when I told him again. And he said ok! Again! There was no no there was no yes. And then our friendship that we had before I had a crush on him fell apart. To this day I regret having a crush on him and telling him. I truly miss the great friendship we had before I messed it up. I know for many people this situation was not the case but for me it was and since then I don\u2019t tell my crushes my true feeling so I don\u2019t ruin the friendships we have. ",

I asked the boy why he likes the girl, and he answers the most simple answer: she is so damn cute! Well, after the boy confessed to the girl on Valentines\u2019 Day two weeks ago, the girl didn\u2019t reply on purpose, which very much upset the boy. But I am trying to give some advice to him. I hope they will build a relationship because if the girl ever accepts, they will be such a wonderful match\u2026 ",

I was shy too but I just decided I have nothing to lose if he doesn't like me . So , if you have a crush I think you should confess your feelings to them . And , if they just don't like you well then you can just move on with your life knowing that you at least told them how you felt . I hope this helps . Feel free to contact me again if you have any ore questions or concerns . ",

            "answer_text": "I think its about that you get that willpower or not. Why we hesitate to say something or confess about love to her because we are afraid that the relationship we are sharing with her may be finish and we may not able to talk her again forever. She maybe our childhood friend, classmate or co-worker, but we are just afraid of not loosing her forever. Just like coin has tow sides Head and Tail, there is same possibility that she may say yes or maybe no. But if you want to confess to her, than I think you should not wait too much, you know when you don't confess and she has same feelings for you, she just wait for you to make first move but you didn't make any. When she get in relationship with someone else and than you confess to her, than believe me it hurts to both of you. I just want to tell you that please confess her immediately when you get that kick from your heart that she is the one you can die for and can give your world to her or when you feel she is your world. Please don't delay too much, It hurts when you see her going into relationship with someone else and you will regret If you propose her It could be you not him. Thanks ",

It was the most intense and infatuated I\u2019ve ever been in all my life and I\u2019m nearly in my mid 20\u2019s. I literally became obsessed with her and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. I\u2019ve never felt like that with anyone in my life, especially a woman! I\u2019m no longer at the job as it was a temporary position but I still think about her a lot. It has gone past the infatuation stage but I still fancy her. The problem is that I\u2019m a lesbian and I\u2019m usually attracted to straight women are i like feminine girls. I know she has a child who is half of my age and she\u2019s like double my age. I\u2019m certain that she\u2019s straight also so even if she wasn\u2019t my manager at one point I don\u2019t think I would even stand a chance. I\u2019m just going to leave it at being a crush as that\u2019s all it\u2019s ever going to be! ",

The important thing was that I was able to build up the courage to tell her the truth instead of keeping it locked up inside. I felt a lot better getting that off my chest, even though it was kind of awkward at first. Anyways, I encourage all of you to tell your crush the truth instead of keeping it locked up inside, unless there are other implications involved. Who knows, they might like you back too. ",

I never knew what that felt like until then. I made a mistake in telling someone that I liked them. I never saw them again. ",

I always think that maybe if they know, there might be a chance for them to like me, or maybe they could possibly change their mind? I always tell myself that, I should tell them because if they don\u2019t like you. Then why are you wasting so much time over someone who doesn\u2019t even like you that way! I\u2019ve finally noticed what the difference between \u201cLove\u201d and what a \u201cCrush\u201d is. It\u2019s an amazing experience. ",
