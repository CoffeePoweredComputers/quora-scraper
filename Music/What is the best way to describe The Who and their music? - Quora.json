            "answer_text": " The Who are my least favourite Hard Rock Band. Now they aren\u2019t a bad band, far from it, Keith Moon is a great drummer, and Roger Daltrey is a powerful singer. However, the issue for me really hangs on Pete Townshend. Not that he is a bad guitarist, far from it, but it's more or less his philosophy and lyrics, I find to be a bit too complicated and preachy for my taste. I am a huge fan of songs like My Generation and Substitute, but from the very moment they released \u201cA Quick One\u201d, Pete just let his imagination overtake him, and the band soon became far too overambitious to be taken seriously. And because of him, The Who shook off their reputation as the most dangerous band in England in favour of joining the \u201cLet\u2019s make Rock music serious, pretentious, and conservative\u201d bandwagon along with other bands like Cream and The Moody Blues. Let's look at some examples of where Pete caused The Who to run afoul: Heaviest song of all time- I can See For Miles. Final result- surprisingly tame compared to what Pete was going for Using Rock music to tell a complex story- Tommy. Final result- the story is a complete betrayal of everything Rock music stands for. They tried again with Quadrophenia and came out with results that are good enough to mark an improvement over Tommy. Pete nearly followed up with an even more horrifying and nasty concept album called Lifehouse. But thank the lord this was not to be, and we got an even better album instead: Who\u2019s Next. I admit that there are some great Rock Operas like Jesus Christ Superstar (Its reputation as a musical makes me hate it less) and The Wall. But Tommy is just about one of the worst albums I have ever heard. My issue doesn\u2019t stem with stuff like Jamming or the kind of music they write about. I just feel rather repugnant towards the Rock bands that attempt to make Rock feel artsy. I see Who\u2019s Next as The Who repenting for the sins they\u2019ve committed against Rock and Roll by trying to make their music less appealing to a conservative audience as Tommy was. So I heavily despise bands like Cream, Yes, Boston, and ELP who try to do just that. And as for the Rock Opera itself, it can be good when done right, and Tommy sadly isn\u2019t done right. Not only does the story take place in an unrealistic and bland fantasy world, but the story is just so plain and simple that it can literally be said in a 3-minute song. Tommy is basically what you get if you bring on Martin Scorsese to write an episode of Sesame Street. At least The Wall was much more grim and realistic (Except for The Trial, which is the worst song on the album). I\u2019m all in for creating new sounds, but only doing it just to take Pop music into mature territory is kind of inappropriate. So we\u2019ll just leave It be. There are some 70s Rock musicians that I like such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin (Their first 2 albums anyway), Black Sabbath, Hawkwind, Electric Light Orchestra, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, Rush, Brian Eno, and Tool. Hell, I can even give The Grateful Dead (the ultimate Jam band), Van Deer Graf Generator and the Mahavishnu Orchestra a pass (because I like Fusion), but that\u2019s because they manage to maintain some excitement in their music. I always look forward to hearing Neil Peart\u2019s drum solos in a Rush song, plus I can relate to a lot in their lyrics. These musicians have done a lot more for Rock music than those bastards I have mentioned above have. Too much overambition and imagination was to Pete Townshend what LSD was to Syd Barret. It made him a complete whacko. Just recently, in an interview, Pete claimed that The Who \u201cSort of Invented Heavy Metal with Live at Leads\u201d. Sorry Pete, but I know a couple of Metal artists who know what Metal truly is. At one point, he even tried to get Roger Daltrey to rap on one of the songs on The Who\u2019s new album. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question because while I love The Who they weren\u2019t my favorite band. But they were an interesting band. They didn\u2019t have a writing partnership like Lennon and McCartney or The Glimmer Twins of The Beatles or Rolling Stones. They weren\u2019t a collective like The Doors. Pete Townsend wrote it all for better or worse. In many ways they were barely friends. They are now, but they had some rough spots and a lot of disagreements over their careers. It was originally Roger\u2019s band. Roger could play guitar and he could sing and he had presence and attitude. Roger was more than a natural frontman. Roger was a frontman extraordinaire. Pete\u2019s guitar style wasn\u2019t typical nor was his vision for The Who\u2019s music and albums. Pete could really play guitar and he played hard and fast and loud. I mean really loud. John\u2019s bass playing was also different. It was driving and melodic but it didn\u2019t really hold their songs\u2019 melody/rhythm to the beat. It sometimes was the bet and sometimes it sounded like the melody. Keith\u2019s drumming often wasn\u2019t really the beat of the music. Keith\u2019s drumming mimicked the lyrics of the song. His drumming was so much more creative than most percussion or simple time-keeping and fills. I think that because of The Who\u2019s non-traditional approach to their instruments place within rock songs is bizarre, but it worked so well that it was so hard to discern the difference, that fierce individualism that was there. That uniqueness that screamed, \u201cHey, we\u2019re different than the rest, but we\u2019re still maximum r&b.\u201d So, they weren\u2019t like any other band. They were The Who. ",
