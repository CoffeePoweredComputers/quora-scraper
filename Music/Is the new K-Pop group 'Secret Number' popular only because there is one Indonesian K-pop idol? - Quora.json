            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Secret Number debuted under VINE Entertainment on May 19th, 2020 with five members: Soodam (Korean)Jinny (Korean-American)Denise (Korean-American)Lea (Japanese)Dita (Indonesian) There are a lot more reasons why the group is getting attention although Dita is one of the main reasons: Soodam immediately got into a bullying scandal right when Secret Number debuted, in which the company denies the accusations and said they will be taking legal actions. Both Jinny and Denise were YG trainees, and Jinny was supposed to debut with BLACKPINK and was part of the original nine member line-up but was said to have left because of health issues. Jinny also participated in Produce 48 and Denise was a contestant on K-Pop Star 5. Lea was a participant of MIXNINE (a Korean survival show hosted by YG) and she had debuted as an idol before in 2012, in a group named SKarf but the group disbanded two years later. And of course, we have Dita, who is probably the first Indonesian idol to ever debut in the K-Pop industry and has received positive feedback from netizens. (She\u2019s so cute and talented, please continue to give her lots of love \ud83d\ude2d) She used to dance at the famous 1MILLION Dance Studio which has over 20 million subscribers on YouTube. Secret Number\u2019s debut song was written by Melanie Fontana, who has worked with Justin Bieber, Girls\u2019 Generation, BTS, TWICE, f(x), and the Chainsmokers. Their music video was trending second on Indonesian YouTube and a lot of their videos are getting thousands of views in just hours. Netizens\u2019 feedback: \"I love their realistic body. I mean nowadays a lot of girl idol has a unrealistic body, that's make bad stereotype for society. Please keep all the member to stay healthy and in realistic shape. We still always support u guys, no matter what size u guys gonna be\" \"Rookie group nowadays doesn't look like a rookie when performing anymore.. This generation will slay\" \"Okay I guess I\u2019m adding another group to my stan list\" \"Damn! the fact that is it a debut stage feels like incredible for me because they own the stage\" \"cant believe i can see Dita in m countdown, im so f'ing proud\" \"I really like this group, because each member has a unique voice and has certain characteristics. all members are very talented, and the song is very good. the members are also all very beautiful. I'm in love with this group I've become your fans. Good luck.\" \"Let's stream till they get more and more recognition and being monster rookie of this year!!\" \"I'm so in love with Dita's voice.\" \"So Lea is Japanese, speaks English and Korean...wow...I really like them all equally...learning more about them has me curious day by day. I\u2019m excited to see them grow!\" \"I\u2019v always loved jinny but damn I can\u2019t take my eyes off from Denise she is the youngest but daamnnnnnnn she be slayin!! I mean they all are but Denise wins my heart!!\" \"Beyond expectation, they get a lot of fans even just from the first song\" \"Guys I know Dita is bringing her nationality to Korea, but please appreciate other members too. They all deserve spotlight, it is okay to have a bias but loving all of them is a must.\" \"After BTS and Twice, now I'm stanning secret number. Let's stream Who Dis?\" \"I know everyone in here were talking about Dita which I'm also proud of her but I just know that Jinny is also here, finally debuted. I'm more than happy for them all.\" \"Finally I can see Lea on stage again after Mixnine a few years ago. Good luck for your debut. And for Dita, I'm proud to see you successfully debuted in Korea. Love you girls\" \"Denise, Dita.. Both of them have unique voice\" \"OMG, Jinny got this YG's rap style...It's cool for the rookie GG\" A lot of people think the attention only came for Dita. Some believe that the popularity will die out soon, using the example of CLC\u2019s Sorn and how she was popular in Thailand for only a short while, but some argue back that BLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa and GOT7\u2019s BamBam has found success in Thailand, so the same can be said for Dita in Indonesia. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say about that, but go check out \u2018Who Dis?\u2019 ",
