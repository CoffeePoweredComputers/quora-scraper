            "answer_text": "Sleep paralysis for most people will usually give you scary visuals because of the fight that is going on in your brain. During sleep your body is naturally paralyzed in order to protect you from mishaps. On occasion (mostly because of genetics or sleep deprivation, but sleep apnea can play a role) the conscious brain may attempt to wake up. This usually occurs during falling asleep or waking up. You can find yourself lost in the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d between sleeping and wakefulness. This can lead to a feeling of being trapped \u2014 slightly aware but unable to move parts or all of your body. That is where the terror begins and you may experience the feeling of someone/something sitting on your chest holding you down. Scary hallucinations may occur, such as the archetypal vision of an old woman or dark figures in the room with you. You are trying to move and wake up but the paralysis is holding you back. You are fighting subconscious \u201cghosts.\u201d But there is good news \u2014 you don\u2019t have to stay in that state. I and many others who have told their stories on Quora have found sleep paralysis to be a jumping off point for \u201clucid dreaming\u201d where you feel aware and in control. You may experience the ability to fly at will or change the scenery in your dream. You say, \u201cHonestly speaking I would rather have some hot girl doing imaginary sexual activities with me\u2026\u201d Such an experience may be possible in lucid dreaming. I have never wished for or encountered that specific scenario but I would think it would be possible. Google \u201clucid dreaming\u201d and you will find some instructions on how to increase the possibility of achieving it, with or without sleep paralysis. Check this link as a starting point: How to Encourage Sleep Paralysis as a Gateway to Extraordinary Dreaming. ",
