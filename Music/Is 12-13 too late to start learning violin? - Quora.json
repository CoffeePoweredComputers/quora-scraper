            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s definitely not too late. In fact some teachers almost prefer students of that age, for many different reasons: While most young children will be \u2018steered\u2019 (or persuaded, or even, in some cases, forced) to play an instrument by their parents, adolescents probably make the decision themselves to start learning. This means they are enthusiastic and motivated.Teenagers are able to read, follow instructions, understand well what is being said to them, and may indeed already have the basics of music learning from another instrument. Therefore a teacher doesn\u2019t have to do everything from scratch and lessons and practice sessions may well be more productive.Teenagers have stamina so the more physically demanding aspects of playing aren\u2019t as daunting to them as they might be to younger students (or indeed to older students).Teenagers are often very intellectually and emotionally curious and by channelling this into instrumental playing can achieve very musical results - they tend to \u2018express\u2019 their feelings in music (which smaller children can\u2019t in the same way, and which adults often find more inhibiting).It\u2019s not all good news however. The downsides are that adolescents are often very busy with other things - other interests, friends, socializing, schoolwork. All of these things are really important aspects of a teenager\u2019s life so they have to continue. Unfortunately acquiring the necessary skills to play the violin needs practice - students actually do have to spend hours in physical contact with the instrument. So an adolescent needs to decide if they have time and commitment for that. We\u2019re not talking hours and hours a day at first - but a little regular daily practice will yield far better results than a few sporadic burst here and there. Also - well, let\u2019s be honest, some teenagers just think the violin isn\u2019t very cool. There may be peer pressure from friends to do other things. So \u2026 one way around this for adolescents is, as quickly as possible, to find a means of integrating instrumental playing into social life. My advice to an adolescent learner would be: \u201cJoin an orchestra (depending on where you live, you may well find a training orchestra that accepts relative beginners) or play with friends. Anything that can alleviate all that time spent practising on your own in your bedroom. Music is above all a social thing so as soon as you can, you should get out there and do it.\u201d I learned as a very small child and reached quite an advanced level. Then I gave up because it caused me grief (for reasons not really connected to the instrument itself) - and only as an adult did I return to it. I\u2019m so glad I did; it gives such a lot of pleasure and enjoyment. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. I started playing the violin when I was 13 or 14 years old. In my experience the progress was really fast. At that age I was old enough to talk to my teacher and understand his instructions. Also, I think the time spent during the lessons were more productive maybe because I was old enough to stay focused. The best part was that I could help choose my recital piece given that my teacher would have had to access if it was possible at my level. ( I chose Czardas btw) However, just a fair warning that at any age learning any instrument needs dedication and commitment. As a 13 year old you need to be able to understand that you need to make time to practice. That means sometimes you can\u2019t go out with friends because you need to stay at home and practice because you need to show your teacher your progress the next day. That doesn't mean that you have to be reclusive and forego going out and having fun but you need to be diligent. Also, theres the need to balance it with studies. So, you will really need to find the method and time management that works for you. ",
