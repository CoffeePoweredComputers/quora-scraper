Our tech is weirdly both more primitive and slightly advanced compared to theirs.I\u2019m pretty sure our population density is quite high compared to a number of planets.We aren\u2019t unified like so many other planets seem to be are constantly fighting among ourselves.Honestly, she\u2019d just think Earth is a really weird planet. If there is one thing that she would be interested in, it\u2019s our art. An artist like her would likely be interested in the work of an alien culture like our own. ",
