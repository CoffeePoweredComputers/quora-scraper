            "answer_text": "There are several and because they were/are amazing pieces of work. Many have found this true with these 2 albums particularly: 1 - PINK FLOYD = Dark Side of the Moon 2- Dream Theater = Images and Words I have added to that list 1- ZEBRA = ZEBRA 2- ZEBRA = 3.V 3- Def Leppard = PYROMANIA 4- BOSTON = BOSTON 5 - BOSTON = Don\u2019t Look Back 6 - JOURNEY = Raised on Radio 7- SADE -Diamond Life 8 - SADE - Stronger Than Pride 9/10- KITARO = Tenku + The Light of the Spirit 11 - Leann Rimes = BLUE 12 - HIROSHIMA = EAST 13- EPICA = WE WILL TAKE YOU WITH US 14- NIGHTWISH = Dark Passion Play TOO MANY MODERN/PROGRESSIVE JAZZ ALBUMS TOO LIST AND TOO MANY SINGLE SONGS TO LIST. THERE ARE ALSO CONCERTS 2 OF WHICH I WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH HE BANDS THEMSELVES SO THEY HAS ADDED MEANING BUT ALSO WERE/ARE EXCELLENT CONCERTS: THESE CONCERTS ARE BOTH AT YOUTUBE. 1 - NIGHTWISH LOWLANDS 2008 Only 2 weeks following that concert the band made a sneak (secret) appearance at a event in the US called ProgpowerUSA where I worked an supported 12 years. I was told to re-arrange ALL the dressing room assignments which was a HUGE ordeal since there were only 2 main ones and 2 secondary ones with 20 BANDS IN 3 DAYS TO BE SCRAMBLED THROUGH and here I was at zero hour having to leave off the dining room set up to do that and it almost killed me. THE BAND AT THAT TIME I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH AS THESE GENRES WERE JUST COMING INTO THE US but the band itself wanted me to advise them as that was my reputation in the industry for years and it started with me being their personal guest at dining and then personal guest at stage for the show and that show was an exact duplicate of the one at Lowlands 2 weeks before. Later that same year they returned to Atlanta on their way out of the country and did another surprise show at a 2nd local venue and I was asked to be their stage guest there as well. THE END RESULT WAS THEY COMMITTED TO ANETTE OLZON AT THAT TIME WHICH BEFORE HAD BEEN HIGHLY IN QUESTION. Anntee Olzon to this day is a highly loved singer. I will note this concert i have listened to 150+ times so far. 2 - EPICA =PINKPOP 2014 The following year that band that I have had a close relationship with since around 2004 when they had just started out, did an amazing concert as noted and then later maybe 8 months later were in the US and at a local venue where I was invited to be their guest for the show. SINCE I REALIZED IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SET LIST AS THE PINKPOP CONCERT WHICH I HAD MEMORIZED\u2026. I LITERALLY MC\u2019D THE CONCERT FROM THE FLOOR AND THE BAND WOULD WAIT FOR ME TO ANNOUNCE THE NEXT SONG. That was super cool. I WILL NOTE THAT I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS CONCERT 100+ TIME SO FAR. Some of those albums listed I may have listened to 100 times as they are simply that good. Once you start the album before you know it you are at the end and can not understand how that happened and this is because these albums are spiritual experiences. ",

I suppose what album truly opened my eyes and helped me become a better songwriter was Joni Mitchell's Blue. I could listen to this album from beginning to end. Over and over. And I have! My favorite song is Blue from the album. Haunting, prolific and simple in a way\u2026all at the same time! Joni Mitchell is constantly challenging me, making me look at things in a different way, making me look at myself. I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way. She is timeless. Truly a pioneer, one of my idols and I am certain, even during a time that I do not understand a lot of the popular music out there these days ( boy I sound old\u2026) she will stand the test of time. She will always reach people. There will never be another Joni Mitchell. ",
