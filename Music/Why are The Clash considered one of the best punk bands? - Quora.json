            "answer_text": "They were by far the most commercial punk band and the one that easiest fits into the conservative Classic Rock mentality of many rock fans. But they were also really, really good. IN my opinion there is a positivity to the Clash that reminds me of the Beatles. It\u2019s not that their music really sounds like the Beatles, it\u2019s the fact that they all \u2014 all four of them, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, and Topper Headon \u2014 fired on all four cylinders all at once. They all sound like they are trying their very hardest. Also Joe Strummer\u2019s abilities as a angry, spitting punk poet \u2014 he was constantly writing verse, compulsively \u2014blended perfectly with Mick Jones\u2019 song-craft and innate production/arrangement abilities. Topper Headon, his background in progressive rock, is one of the greatest drummers ever, in my opinion, and a talented multi-instrumentalist in his own right. Paul Simonon\u2019s simple but effective basslines, amazing good looks and designs brought a sexy and tough glamor to the band. Live, at their height they were amazing: tight, incredibly energetic, musically good, visually exciting.  ",

            "answer_text": "Punk rock really only lasted from 1977 to the early 80s. During that time lots of great bands made great music, but most faded really fast.   The Clash were the first punk band to have an impact in the US. And they put out 2 amazing records, 2 more good ones, and then some subpar offerings that still are worth listening to. Most other punk bands really just had 1 impactful recording, sometimes just a song, and those band were mostly finished by 1980 (though some were just getting started). As well, The Clash were one of the few bands talented enough to participate in the full essence of punk. That is, most people only identify punk as fast, sloppy three-chord songs with angsty or non-chalant lyrics. Bands like The Ramones, Sex Pistols and the Dead Kennedys mastered that style of punk. But there was also the eclectic avant garde punk of bands like Talking Heads and the Sranglers and the more introspective bands like Television. The Clash were able to span that entire spectrum, with some of the best three-chord shouters (\"White Riot\"\"Bored with the USA) and some much more eclectic fare (\"Lost in the Supermarket\" \"Straight to Hell\"). Joe Strummer and gang also evolved as a band, basically inventing pop-punk, scoring 2 big hits (\" Should I Stay\" \"Rock the Casbah\"), and prodicing the de facto anthem of their hometown (\" London Calling\"). Another significant detail was their fomenting of the bond between British punk and Jamaican music, covering a few classic Jamaican songs, composing their own ska and reggae tracks and working with Lee Scratch Perry, and by being part of the rockabilly revival (\"I Fought the Law\" \"Brand New Cadillac\").
