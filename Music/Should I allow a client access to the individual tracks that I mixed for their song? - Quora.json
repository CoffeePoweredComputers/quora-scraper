            "answer_text": "I can answer from the perspective of Engineers/Producers and Major Labels and Music Business Affairs in the UK. Assuming they paid for the recording then, by law you have to supply the flat multitrack parts. So that means Bar 1 WAVs of the multitrack, or a clean (No mix information) Pro Tools / Logic /Whatever session. You also have to provide them with the mixes. So if they have paid you and asked for an Instrumental, an Acapella etc\u2026 then you have to supply that. It sounds like they are asking you for \u201cStems\u201dMark Bowyer's answer to Audio and Acoustical Engineering: What is a vocal or instrumental stem? (mixed audio elements) of every single audio track for the entire song. Given the amount of time and effort that would take, it would be extremely unreasonable to ask you to give them these for free! If they are happy to pay for them, then sure, go ahead. You aren\u2019t giving away any \u201csecrets\u201d and that is a good half days (at least) work. I kindof understand why you wouldn\u2019t want your mix deconstructed, but you aren\u2019t really going to be losing anything except time creating these parts\u2026 If they want them badly enough, they should pay you well enough for you to get over the \u201cdiscomfort\u201d. Just FYI: Stems are now part of all major labels in the UK (and I think US) deliverables. So you have to send them, but only because they are in the contract. Although they are far more reasonable. Like just 8\u201320 per track. Drums, Bass, Perc, Keys etc\u2026. I can\u2019t see a time you would ever be asked to deliver \u201cevery single audio track as a stem\u201d. That just isn\u2019t realistic. What you don\u2019t have to give them is your mix multitrack session. That is your intellectual property and they have no right to it whatsoever. No-one in the UK would insist on it, and they wouldn\u2019t get anywhere legally either, unless you had signed a contract saying you would. As for me. Sometimes I do give away my session and lots of \u201cbig name\u201d engineers aren\u2019t precious about them either. I\u2019ve trawled my way through Tony Maserati mix sessions, Jaycen Joshua mix sessions, Rich Costey\u2026 lots of people. Eye opening stuff. But largely useless for ripping their \u201cstyle\u201d off! That said, there are a couple of Mixers I\u2019m aware of that refuse to give even stems away, but these guys are \u201csuperstar\u201d mixers so the labels let them slip by. It\u2019s not like them seeing how I De-Essed the drum room is going to unlock my mixing skills for them, and they wont have my hardware so it\u2019s not like they can fully recreate my mix. It really depends. I don\u2019t normally, but if they have a good reason and aren\u2019t huge a-holes\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am not a music lawyer so please don\u2019t take the following as legal advice, I do however deal with issues like this for projects I work on. Furthermore, I can\u2019t really speak on mixing music for individual music clients, but I have extensive experience producing, composing, and mixing audio for commercial use, and the following concepts may apply to you \u2013 not necessarily in this case, but certainly for future projects. Short Answer: Q: \u201cI mixed a song \u2026 who technically owns those tracks?\u201d It depends on your initial agreement with the client, but if it is not your music, i.e., you did not produce it, compose it, or arrange it, it isn\u2019t yours. Most recording and mix work is done on this basis. You do the job, get paid, deliver the goods and move on. Also, to be honest, if a client is asking for individual tracks of an already mixed track you probably don\u2019t want credit for what they are going to do with them anyway\u2026 Furthermore, if you have done a good job mixing, the processed, individual tracks probably sound like ass on their own, so maybe explaining that to the client (using less vulgar terminology) will sway their request. Longer Answer: Q: \u201cWhat is the norm in the industry?\u201d For freelance commercial audio - pre-post and post-production - almost all work is done on a work-made-for-hire basis, especially when dealing with \u201cbig\u201d clients. What that means is you do the work, they pay for it, and they own it outright. They can do what they like with it. No residuals, no royalties, no credits (unless otherwise stipulated, and even then not usually given). This is often offset by an inflated flat fee to compensate for future \u201clost\u201d revenue. Q: \u201cWho technically owns those tracks?\u201d The person paying for the work, not you, is treated as its author. Work Made for Hire: What It Really Means Essentially, if the client paid you to mix something, and that is your only contribution to the project, it is their prerogative to do what they wish with any finalised material you hand over, even have it mixed by someone else \u2013 it\u2019s their property. Unless you have negotiated a clear and legal stake in the work, or added significant artistic content (like re-writing lyrics or musical parts, amongst others), any issue with client requests is like being a mechanic getting angry at a customer for wanting their car back after a tune up. Q: \u201cIs there any reason to or not to give him the tracks?\u201d Mr De Gonzaga Sevilla brings up a good point about being very clear on what it is you are being paid to do \u2013 if the client paid for a mix that is what they get, if they want stems or multi tracks at the end of the session they must stipulate that, and you must agree (or not) before work commences. It is also more workload, so fees go up. You\u2019d be amazed how rapidly client requests abate once added fees are mentioned\u2026 Finally, I cannot stress how important it is to get all work agreements in some form of writing - the humble e-mail. While not legally watertight, some form of \u201cagreed in writing\u201d is pure CYA (Cover Your Ass) for scope creep. Scope creep (also called requirement creep, function creep and feature creep) in project management refers to uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in a project's scope. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered harmful. - Scope creep - Wikipedia So for example, now that your client is asking for multitracks you can go back through your e-mail chain with them and point out that in such and such an e-mail, dated xx xx xxxx, you made it clear that no multitracks would (or could) be delivered, only a stereo premaster at xx levels and mixed down stems of predetermined groups (like EFX, Voice Over, and Music, as a plastic example). Without that e-mail the client can claim you did agree, but just forgot, and it becomes a he said she said scenario. Always ugly. Actually, by using your own statement, \u201cI don't want CLIENT (\u201cHim\u201d) taking parts of my mix and using them without giving credit.\u201d you have a basis for part of your \u201ccontract\u201d with \u201cHim\u201d, and somewhere in e-mails with him you should have this explicitly mentioned. (Although, this wording means as long as he credits you, you\u2019ll hand over the multitracks, so be careful. What do you really want to have? Control over your final mix, or that you are credited fairly?) Personally, I do not hand over bits and pieces to the client, they get a polished stereo premaster, unless otherwise requested, and all of that is fleshed out in documentation and meetings long before work even starts. My resources, responsibilities and deliverables are very clearly outlined from the beginning, and such methodology largely mitigates issues like the one you are having. Congrats on getting some paid work. I know the info here might not help you right now, but I hope some of it aids you in your future endeavours. ",
