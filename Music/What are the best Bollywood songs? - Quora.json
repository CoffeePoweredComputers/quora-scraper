            "answer_text": "A2A There are more than 10 songs I love. More than the music, more than the beats, what I love in a song are the lyrics. My list might not be everyone\u2019s favorite, but just because the lyrics are outstanding, I can\u2019t get over these top-10 songs in my life. I can have nothing in my phone, but these songs are something that I need like \u2018air\u2019. #1 Aye Khuda (From Murder 2, starring Emran Hashmi and Jacqueline Fernandez) - The lyrics of this song just pick you up from air, and throw you at the ground. You realize how insignificant you are compared to the world. How your life will end one day and what will remain are the memories of you\u2026  #2 Zindagi Ke Safar Mein (From Aap Ki Kasam, starring Rajesh Khanna) - Again, the lyrics are mind-blowing!  #3 Kal Ho Na Ho (From Kal Ho Na Ho, starring Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Priety Zinta) - The lyrics teach you, how to live your life!  #4 Khawahishein (From Heroine, starring Kareena Kapoor, Randeep Hooda and Arjun Rampal) - It\u2019s about your dreams, wishes and how your life is passing in all this ruckus of fulfilling your wishes. You are not living in real sense, you are just running from one wish to another.  #5 Kuch Na Kaho (From A Love Story, starring Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala) - It\u2019s one of the most romantic songs in my opinion. The lyrics and the theme on which it is built, are both simply beautiful!  #6 Ik Pyaar Ka Nagma (From Shor) - This is the song I\u2019ve grown up listening to. It\u2019s my dad\u2019s favorite, and it\u2019s lyrics are simply unparalleled. The best line from the song I feel is \u2018Do pal ke jeewan se, ik umr churani hai, zindagi aur kuch bhi nahi, teri meri kahani hai\u2026\u2019 (Translation: From this life of two moments, you have to steal an age. This life is nothing else, but a story of you and me\u2026)  #7 Yaaro Dosti Badi Hi Haseen Hai (A Solo sung by KK) - This song takes me back to the school time, and the lyrics can\u2019t be any more truer! Friendship indeed, is beautiful\u2026  #Bhar Do Jholi Meri (From Bajrangi Bhaijaan starring Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan) - This is not exactly a song, but a qawalli, but the lyrics are superb!  #8 Aashiyan (From Barfi, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Ileana D\u2019cruz and Priyanka Chopra) - Not only this movie was highly emotional and meaningful, but this song has a life of it\u2019s own. Every word of this song is meaningful! However, there\u2019s one line which touches my heart the most \u2018Na ho koi takrarein, arey masti-thahake chalein. Pyaar ke sikkon se, mahine ka kharcha chaley\u2026\u2019 (Translation - There isn\u2019t any dispute, but only fun and laughter. With the currency of love, the monthly household expenses are met.)  #9 Mere Mehboob Qayamat Hogi (From Mr X in Bombay, sung by Kishore Kumar) - This is the \u2018breakup\u2019 song from your grandparents\u2019 time! The lyrics are beautiful. To know anything more, just listen to it! Many top bollywood singers have done cover of this song, but I like the original one the most.  #10 Tere Bina Zindagi Se Koi (From Aandhi, starring Sanjeev Kumar and Suchitra Sen) - The lyrics. The lyrics. THE LYRICS! Not even one song so far has matched the level of this song.  Although the lists doesn\u2019t end here, and I can easily mention fifty more songs which are fabulously written, but these are the top ten of them! Purposely I included both new and old ones. Let\u2019s not undermine the talent of this age either\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "OMG! There's a bollywood channel I can follow! Okay so first off, all my friends find it so weird that I'm like the only one in my group that would be singing Bollywood songs on top of my voice ( sometimes it's my own versions too lol\u2026my Hindi is not all that great, but I'm teaching myself lol so gimme a break lol) Here's my top 10 (Note I didn't add any fancy pics or anything to this list\u2026.also, my spelling may be wrong so bare with me) 10 - Tu Hi Rab - Rahut Fateh Ali Khan This is my wedding song lol. I translated the lyrics to see what it meant in English\u2026at first I thought it was a bit stalkerish\u2026but I now think it's amazing. 9 - Humdard - Arijit Singh Ek villain is the movie that started my love for Bollywood. Lol, I hate to admit, but I cried like a baby for the train scene! Humdard was the song that played in this scene! *hides my face* 8 - Galliyan - Ankit Tiwari and Shraddha Kapoor I know the Ankit only version is the more famous one, but I think Shraddha sang this song very well. So I prefer the unplugged version over the main version 7 - Tu Tu Hai Wohi - Jonita Gandhi This isn't a very famous song! But TRUST me\u2026 listen to it! Yeah\u2026thank me later 6 - Kaaye Chhed - from Devdas This song is so cool I learned all the lyrics and people give me the weird look when I actually sing it out loud \u2026.also\u2026dixit! 5 - Te Amo - Mohit Chauhun I swear this song almost has a Spanish salsa vibe to it. 4 - Zarooritha - Rahut Fateh Ali Khan The love was necessary..and the separation too. One of life's very difficult truths - what had happened was meant to happen. 3 - Suhani Raat -Aakash Ghandi Apparently this is a really old song, but I heard Aakash Ghandi\u2019s version and was blown away! 2 - Kabhi Jo Badal - Shreya Ghoshal Shreya\u2019s version is amazing! I prefer it over Arijit Singh\u2019s version even! 1 - Tum Hi Ho -Arijit Singh This song will always be my top song. Probably because my ex and I had a major fight, then this song came up and for some reason, the fight ended and we apologised (true Bollywood style lol\u2026you had to be there) Hope u enjoy!!! ",
