            "answer_text": "There are many ways to look at the evolution of artistic style. For this question, I think that the framework developed by Wylie Sypher in Four Stages Of Renaissance Style is extremely useful. It\u2019s also consistent with the overall view of representation that Gombrich develops in The Story Of Art. Let\u2019s take as a starting point the notion that art is a way of representing and transforming reality, and that artistic styles represent different ways of doing that. Egyptian art had a well-developed set of artistic canons that served it well for nearly 3000 years, with a brief hiatus in the Amarna period. Medieval art, too, had a distinct method of representation, every bit as sophisticated as any other style. We can say that the distinctive stylistic break between medieval and Renaissance art comes with the rediscovery of vanishing point perspective with Brunelleschi in the 1420s, and the rethinking of a painting as capturing a single moment in a precisely defined illusionistic frame. This can fit any number of styles or subjects. Crivelli\u2019s Annunciation of 1485 is one example with a jeweled style that owes much to medieval illumination:  Masaccio\u2019s The Tribute Money of 1427 is an example with a less decorative style:  As is Perugino\u2019s Delivery Of The Keys of 1481\u20131482:  All isolate the dramatic moment, but with balance and repose. This is what Sypher calls the first stage of Renaissance style. (I am not attempting anything here except a very high-level series of stylistic examples. There is a great deal going on in each of these paintings as well as the single dramatic moment, but that is the focus. How do we inject energy and movement? That problem leads to the second stage, mannerism, which introduces dramatic contrasts and distortions of various sorts. For example, there is the swirling energy and dramatic distortion of Tintoretto\u2019s The Translation Of St. Mark (1562\u20131566):  Caravaggio intensifies the contrast between light and shade, chiaroscuro, with distorted figures as well in Judith Beheading Holofernes, c. 1600:  Or El Greco 1577\u20131579 Assumption Of The Virgin:  The restless energy of mannerism creates its own problems; it feels too unstable within the confines of the frame, just as the early Renaissance style lacks energy within the frame. The next phase is Baroque, where the energy remains but the figures are placed in enormous volumes of space. For example, from the 1670s, there is Gaulli\u2019s decoration for the Chruch of the Gesu in Rome, like the cupola:  And the Triumph Of The Name Of Jesus:  Another example is Ruben\u2019s cycle about the life of Marie de Medici, 1622\u20131624, now in the Louvre and ignored by many who just run in and out of the gallery with La Gioconda down the corridor. This is one of the 24, The Disembarkation At Marseilles, lavished with allegorical figures:  Tiepolo\u2019s Allegory Of The Continents in Wurzberg (the largest fresco in the world), 1752, and very late Baroque, is another example:  In England, there is Thornhill\u2019s Painted Hall at Greenwich, 1705:  These last two shade into the last phase of Renaissance art, the late Baroque, in which the energies of the Baroque become more purely decorative and controlled. After the late Baroque, new styles emerge\u2014neo-classical and Romantic\u2014marking the end of Renaissance art. I find this a compelling way to look at the evolution of style over the period between the beginning of the 15th century and the early part of the 18. The Baroque is not reaction, but evolution. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very good question: it what ways can the Baroque be viewed as a reaction to the Renaissance? I\u2019m sure you are aware of the German philosopher Hegel who posited that many theories and events occur in a sequence of action, reaction, and resolution. From a very great distance, with the mid-sixteenth century followers of Michelangelo considered part of the Renaissance, the writers of the Baroque period such as GiovanPietro Bellori said that the early Baroque artists, the Carracci and Caravaggio, rejected the works of their predecessors and returned to nature. They used deeper, more saturated colors, and made the narrative clearer and easier to read than the mid-late 16th century works by Michelangelo and his followers. They rejected nudity (which the Renaissance adopted from studying Greek and Roman statues, which kept being found in Rome and other towns when people dug to erect new buildings. Instead, they strove to carve figures in draperies that revealed the anatomical structure underneath without being immodest. ",
