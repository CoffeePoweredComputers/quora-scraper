            "answer_text": "We could build a machine to play guitar faster than any human who ever lived, but so what? Speed does not magically translate into artistic quality. Why does anyone even care which guitarist has the fastest fingers ever? Not to knock Eddie Van Halen, but there have been many other guitarists who, like him, combine speed with musical genius. Check out John McLaughlin and the late Allan Holdsworth, for example, and Django Reinhardt and the Gypsy guitarists who followed him. You want speed? I\u2019ll leave you with this clip from the amazing Danny Gatton:  All these players were about lots more than just speed. ",

Identifying \u201cthe\u201d fastest is impossible (plus pointless; there is such a thing as \u201ctoo fast\u201d), but just to name two great fast players, I\u2019d like to shout out Michael Angelo Batio (author of \u201cSpeed Kills\u201d), and the late Shawn Lane.

I believe the title used to belong to Steve Vai, but most pros don\u2019t really pay attention to who's the fastest as the goal is to make beautiful music and get out what's in your head. Melody is always paramount, and speed is very low on the list of priorities. ",
