            "answer_text": "It depends on what you're going to do with it. If you're buying it to noodle around on at home\u2014Les Paul. If you're looking to gig around and try and scratch out \u201ca living\u201d with it\u2014Strat. Let me explain: Both guitars hold, if not slightly increase their monetary value over time. Play style is player dependent, not guitar dependent (there have been numerous guitarists across a multitude of genres that have enjoyed success with either/or/both a Les Paul and/or Strats). A Les Paul will hold its relative monetary (which [depending on model] can be thousands) over time, yet it diminishes if worn from excessive use, and/or damage. In addition, the chances of damage increase with each successive use. The type and extent of the damage that could occur increase with environments it's introduced to, and the hazards present in that environment. A hypothetical example\u2026a bar/club. Set a Les Paul down even briefly, and you risk a topple and snapping the signature, ever fragile, poorly angled headstock (though I hear they really find their sound after the second headstock repair), you risk theft, gouging, beer spills, burns, etc. All of which are diminished returns on investment.  Those mic stands alone\u2026sheesh. So, if you plan on playing in the relative safety of your home/\u201djam space, etc. (Which I would hope had a lower hazard rating than your standard bar), and can afford one\u2014a Les Paul. It sounds good, holds its value, and looks pretty on a wall. A Fender Strat is privy to all the same hazards (save the headstock, as a Strat\u2019s is more sturdy and more or less flat on straight), however\u2026should you incur damage to a Strat, you can easily replace most of its components yourself. They can also cost a bit less than a Les Paul (depending on model, of course). A cost difference that can be made up with gigging, should you so desire to do so. Plus, should you desire a pickup change; it can be done with little effort (depending on body routing of course), just remember to keep all the original parts and the overall value shouldn't dip near as drastically as that of a Les (should you choose to mod a Les, you should do the same). Now, a good overall plan, that worked for many a guitar player I knew back in the day, was to gig enough with the Strat to buy a Les. Eventually, you can get a \u201cbest of both worlds \u201c with that deal, though\u2026watch that headstock. Yikes. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the other good answers, both guitars suffer from different design flaws; however the flaws of the Strat are much easier to fix. Strat design flaws: The floating tremolo can cause tuning stability issues. This can often be fixed with a good setup and can always be fixed by adding more springs to the underside of the bridge, essentially creating a fixed bridge (you won\u2019t be able to use the vibrato arm anymore, but your guitar will stay in tune). Les Paul design flaws: The Les Paul frequently suffers from tuning issues due to the headstock design. Fender headstocks allow the string to travel in a straight line all the way to the tuner; Les Pauls pull the strings away from the nut towards the tuner. This angle creates friction and can cause the strings to stick in the nut, making the guitar hard to tune. This can often be improved by having a luthier replace the nut. The bigger flaw for Les Paul\u2019s is the backwards headstock angle. It is necessary to apply downward pressure across the nut, without which, the strings would flop around out of the nut. Fender does this with a string tree \u2014 a more reliable design. The Les Paul headstock\u2019s angle weakens the area where the headstock joins the neck, and increases the likelihood that the guitar will land on the headstock if it falls backwards. This can be a recipe for broken headstocks. It\u2019s worth noting that other manufacturers (PRS comes to mind) use a downward angled headstock, but with a less drastic downward angle; which seems to remedy the problem.  Straight string pull with string tree for downward tension  Angled string pull with backwards headstock for downward tension  You can find plenty of vintage Les Paul\u2019s that look a bit like this. The Les Paul is a gorgeous work of art and a beautiful instrument \u2014 but it demands to be treated as such. If you think this guitar is going to take a beating, you might want to lean towards the Strat. ",
