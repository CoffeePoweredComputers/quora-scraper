            "answer_text": "Some technology:  wah-wah: A rocking pedal moved with your foot while playing. It has a sharp midrange eq boost that changes frequency as you move the pedal, giving a vocal sound. (Crybaby, Morley) fuzz: A device that overloads transistors with excess signal. It adds sustain to notes, dynamic compression, and makes a more aggressive tone overall. (Fuzz Face, Big Muff, etc) overdrive: A device similar to a fuzz, that works by passing signals through diodes for clipping. Less aggressive than a fuzz generally. Meant to emulate the sounds of an overdriven amp at lower volumes, or get more overdrive from an amp. (Tube Screamer, Distortion+, Rat) Leslie: An organ speaker cabinet with two speakers that physically rotate at different speeds, creating a doppler effect with pitch-shifting vibrato. Not very practical onstage, but widely used in the studio.  Phase shifter: A device to sort of emulate the sound of a Leslie by modulating a phase-shifted signal with an oscillator. Really, a sound in its own right - more mysterious and funky than the Leslie. (Phase 90, Uni-Vibe) Tape echo - A device that creates echoing repeats of notes by recording them on tape and playing them back milliseconds later. (Echoplex, Space Echo) Reverb - Many guitar amps have a reverb device that works by applying signal to springs and then playing it back, mixed in with regular signal. Spring reverb doesn't sound much like an actual acoustic space, but it's a critical part of many players' tones.  Slide - A metal or glass cylinder worn on the finger, used instead of fretting notes to set pitches. This is actually very old technology, as old as recorded guitars, but it was very important to many 1970s sounds.  Amplifiers are an incredibly important part of the electric guitar sound. Guitar amps of that era (and even today) are modeled on primitive vacuum tube circuits from the 1950s, with frequency-limited and inaccurate speakers. Matching the right amp, guitar, and technique is really the core of great electric guitar sounds. Effects are usually an afterthought.  A lot turns on technique, too. Guitar allows a much wider variety of physical approaches to notes than the piano does. Notes can be bent from one to another, hammered-on or pulled-off, whole chords can slide up and down (listen to \"Funk 49\" by the James Gang, with Joe Walsh on guitar, for a complete vocabulary of these sounds).  Another characteristic sound of the 1970s is harmony parts (Brian May from Queen is the absolute master of this). Overdriven/fuzzy sounds and complex chord voicings don't go well together, and can turn into mush. Recording multiple single-line parts in harmony is a way around that, but is a sound in its own right. Some bands used multiple guitar players to get harmonies live (Allman Brothers, Thin Lizzy, Eagles). A classic of that style is the outro of \"Hotel California\".  Great guitar players put a lot of pride into developing a distinctive voice, an instantly recognizable and personal sound. This is often based on preferred effects and techniques.  Hope this helps some! ",

            "answer_text": "The seventies sound was a warm crunchy sound, but still clean, largely influenced by the British Invasion. By that I mean it has some overdrive to it, but the individual notes can be heard distinctly.The best way to explain this is by example\u2026.Listen to most of the songs on Derek and the Dominoes Layla album from the 70\u2019s ( Eric Clapton).There is enough drive to give a nice crunch, buy the individual notes can be easily heard as distinct from one another. Now listen to most of the songs on Surfing with the Alien by Joe Satriani . The sound is heavily distorted and involves the skillful use of harmonics, almost unlimited sustain, lots of feedback, and a tendency for the notes to run together. It takes very good technique to control the sound between the notes and if you are not carefull the sound can get out of control. Think of it as the difference between firing a revolver and firing an Uzi. Both pack a punch, but with the pistol you hear each individual shot. With the Uzi you hear a kind of brbrbrbrbrb were the shots are not so distinct. If you lose control of a revolver due to recoil you will probably miss your target and that\u2019s it. With an Uzzi you will miss your target and the weapon may continue to fire in an out of control manner.Now think of the seventies sound as more like the revolver, as opposed to the 90\u2019s metal influenced  sound as similar to the Uzzi.
