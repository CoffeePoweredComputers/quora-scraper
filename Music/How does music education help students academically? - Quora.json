            "answer_text": "USC Thornton faculty from the Brain Creativity Institute (BCI) released a report on November 13th, 2017 that demonstrates how music education changes children\u2019s brain structure and boosts their decision-making network. In as little as two years of music instruction, music training can: modify the structure of the brain\u2019s white matter, which carries signals through the brainmodify the structure of the brain\u2019s gray matter, which contains most of the neurons that are active in processing informationleads to greater engagement, boosts the ability to focus, and inhibits impulses when young musicians perform an intellectual task\u201cTogether these results demonstrate that community music programs can offset some of the negative consequences that low socioeconomic status can have on child development,\u201d - Assal Habibi, lead author and an assistant research professor of psychology. Music education is essential in K-12 schools. Children are left without when underprivileged schools remove music education. Although community music programs help, they are not always accessible to low income families. USC Thornton launched two new master\u2019s programs in July 2017 to transform the landscape of music education programs: Master\u2019s of Music in K-12 Contemporary Teaching PracticeMaster\u2019s of Music in Community MusicI hope this information helps!

            "answer_text": "Students who participate in a music program will tend to score 50 points higher one standardized tests. ()% of those ion a school music program go on to college. The norm is 50%. Music creates maps from constellations in formed in the brain from practiced behaviors. Neurons that fire together wire together. So, daily reinforcement of the playing of music will strengthen these neural pathways. With sleep we prune that which is considered unnecessary. A decision made in the brain stem and limbic system. So, if we do not practice daily (vacations are good, too, so I recommend six days a week) Then the maps needed to understand and behave at a high standard of playing crumble or never form. Learning music gradually develops these maps, creating the environment for release of feel good neural chemicals (adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, etc) so that learning can and does take place. In order to effect this growth, we must discipline ourselves, apply determination, diligence, persevere, learn patience, time management, study effectively and a lot of other transferable skills. In short the discipline of learning music spills over to other life behaviors. We use 21 areas of the brain to make music, more so than any other activity we engage in. Imagine the coordinations. ",
