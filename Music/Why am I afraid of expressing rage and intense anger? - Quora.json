            "answer_text": "When we get angry and give voice to our frustration and rage, it frightens others, even our loved ones because anger and rage is not far from violent behaviour in our most primitive of responses. Perhaps this is why this reaction makes you afraid or possibly you feel by getting angry your losing control of your emotions. Maybe thats not the type of behavior you feel is appropriate to display around others. Perhaps as a child you had a parent or authority figure in your life who felt getting angry was disrespectful because you were a child. Its difficult to say as I dont know you and there are quite a few reasons you may feel this way. If you feel its causing a disruption in your life as far as your relationships are concerned, you may want to consider talking to a therapist. Before I let this go I wanted to return to your question, you asked about expressing intense anger and rage. Lets start at a calm demeanor at level 0. Ok you stub your toe on a bed post and get angry, lets put that at 4. Someone backs into your car at work and dents the fender, thats about a 6. I would put intense anger at around 8 and rage at 10. Getting angry is normal, lets say to a level 7 at its highest, so if you react at an 8 when it should be a 4 or 5, theres something that needs attention and maybe thats why your afraid to express yourself. You could be all too aware of how you react, so you try to control it but its difficult so youve gotten to the point of actually being frightened of your own response and reaction to what angers you. As I suggested before you may want to talk to a therapist about how to safely express your anger and how to control it when you do. I feel it may help you find a more relaxed future. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because you are wise. Expressing rage and intense anger is a good way to end up arrested, fired or divorced. No want wants you to vomit your negative emotions on them. They have problems of their own. So, see a therapist and work out your issues or when you decide to express your rage, you might take a bullet or a nightstick across the head. I\u2019ll never understand why the idea took hold that adults can do this. Self-control is underrated. ",
