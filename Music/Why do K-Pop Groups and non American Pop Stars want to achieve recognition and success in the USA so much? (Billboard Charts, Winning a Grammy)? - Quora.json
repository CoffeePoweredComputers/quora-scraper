            "answer_text": "It's not obsession to want to be recognized for your hard work. I'm not a fan of the other 2 groups so I can't speak for them, but I believe it's safe to say that my awnser can be applied to all artists. Besides, the word \u2018obsess\u2019 is too strong to be used in this context. Being obsessed with winning the award they would talk about constantly, bringing it up wherever they go and exude behavior that screams desperate to gain what they want. Using the same reasoning, go ahead and tell Drake to go back to Canada. Taylor Swift and Beyonce both to pack it up. Harry Styles to go back across the pond. See how that goes. They are known internationally, so then they too would be considered \u201cobsessed\u201d. Hmm, so it seems my awnser was taken as if I was offended. No matter I shall clear up a bit ~ If you (readers) are reading it with that thought in mind, please read my answer again. It's meant to be in a conversational/serious voice. again I can't speak about BP or Exo fans. I can only speak about BTS fans. Not only is a lot of promotion done by armys, but we also have to sometimes fight for BTS to not be taken advantage of. For example, just recently Jason Derulo collabed with 3 BTS members on a Savage Love Remix. The song was only doing so well and mostly only known as \u201ca tiktok song\u201d. After the collaboration the track rose on the charts, streaming stats went up. Instead of celebrating with the BTS members who collaborated with him, he also didn't credit them - Hoseok, Yoongi and Jungkook didn't get recognition for their own work on the song. He also celebrated the original song when it was the remix that was gaining numbers. That's why it may seem as obsession. Armys promote and do their best to make sure they're treated like they should be. Also it may be your TL.I'm open to edits, if you the reader has a better wording I may use then just comment in kind. I do try my best to sound as impartial as possible while trying to give \u201cwhat if\" and \u201cturn it around\u201d as to give perspective when answering questions. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is so funny ,how\u2019s a group like EXO that has never stepped foot in US promoting or doing anything that could be even considered slight promo ,be obsessed with achieving recognition in USA?? Wouldn\u2019t they have to target the market first to begin with (which would be normal btw not obsession) ,then if they start doing over the top shit we could say they\u2019re obsessed! But fact they did non of that \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d bruh I wished they did normal promo to begin with in markets they\u2019re already familiar in ,such as Chinese or Japanese etc ,but fact they haven\u2019t last era was lowkey it was actually annoying ,yet they\u2019re still grouped with other kpop acts that your question could be applied for!! This is frustrating :/ But anyways targeting markets happens both ways ,cooperations gotta profit ,if they think they can make more money in US they can go for it, if they think Asian market is best then why not ,I\u2019d say tho ,I do see the obsession with US market & I noticed couple of companies are basically losing money with the way they\u2019re pushing their groups towards that market ,just to be recognized in US & nothing else ,so that\u2019s questionable, but again maybe it\u2019s a long term plan ,we also gotta understand US market is a western market ,so at the end of the day ppl would die to be more known there even if it doesn\u2019t earn them much money!
