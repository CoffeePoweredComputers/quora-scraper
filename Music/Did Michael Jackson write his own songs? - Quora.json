            "answer_text": "Yes, he did. And their entire arrangements as well.  Michael Jackson couldn\u2019t read nor write music. He could play several instruments a bit like keyboards, synthesizer, guitar, drums and percussion, but not proficiently. However, Jackson could hear and compose songs, including their arrangements, in his head. Then what he would do was \u201csing\u201d every note of every instrument to a top team of engineers and producers who would work on the tracks. Rob Hoffman, sound engineer, described the process: \u201cOne morning MJ came in with a new song he had written overnight. We called in a guitar player and Michael sang every guitar chord to him. \u2018Here\u2019s the first chord, first note, second note, third note, etc. etc. \u201cWe then witnessed him giving the most heartfelt and profound vocal performance, live in the control room through an SM57. \u201cHe would sing an entire string arrangement, every part. He had it all in his head, harmony and everything. He would actually sing the entire arrangement into a micro-cassette recorder complete with stops and fills.\u201d During the \u201cDangerous\u201d court case when songwriter Crystal Cartier sued him for plagiarism, he was asked to describe his songwriting process in court. \u201cI\u2019ll just sing the bass part into tape recorder\u201d, he said between snips of sung melody, totally pitch perfect. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that\u2019s what inspires the melody,\u201d he explained, before beat-boxing in court. On \u201cBillie Jean\u201d he said, \u201cListen, you\u2019re hearing four basses on there, doing four different personalities, and that\u2019s what gives it character, but it takes a lot of work.\u201d Of course, you don\u2019t need to be formally trained in music to be a successful artist. And Jackson was an example. He created some of the greatest pop anthems of all time without knowing how to notate. And that he was able to do that in an amazing way and with brilliant results, only adds to the sense that what MJ had was a really special gift. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson, like every mainstream professional performer had many song writers in his camp but with so many years in the music and entertainment industry under his belt, he must have penned a few of his own songs or at least been an influential part in the song-making process. John Lennon once famously said, that no-one over 30 has ever written a song worth listening to. Truth is, some people are wonderful song writers but almost never perform themselves (Dianne Warren and Kenneth Babyface Edmonds, for example) but have an incredible number of hits. Others are great musicians, well known in the industry for their prowess on their particular instrument (Paulinho da Costa, Nathan East to name but a few) and having played on thousands of recordings but never receiving the accolades that the frontman of the group usually gets from the fans. MJ\u2019s strength came from his being an overall performer, the presentation and delivery of his songs being his specific skills. As such, I am sure he played a big part in making those songs work for him. ",

Once he broke away he was allowed more creative control of the songs he wrote and the albums he released. The first album he made after breaking away from Motown, \u201cOff the Wall\u201d had 3 songs written or co-written by him and they were co-produced by him along with Quincy Jones. The following album Thriller had Jackson write and co-produce 4 songs with again Quincy Jones. The hit song \u201cBillie Jean\u201d almost never made it on the album due to a dispute between the 2 about the intro as well as royalties. Thankfully they patched things up and the rest they say is history. As his career progressed so did the amount of songs he wrote under the advice of Quincy Jones after he was dealing with personal turmoil. Bottom line, he wrote his own songs. ",

Some of the most famous songs Michael have ever written for himself include Beat It, the legendary Billie Jean, Black or White, Dirty Diana, Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Heal The World, and The Way You Make Me Feel.  Not only that Michael wrote tunes for himself alone, but he also showed that he could be a very good songwriter for others. He co-wrote We Are The World by USA For Africa with Lionel Richie, which now became one of the most famous world peace anthems of all-time besides Imagine by John Lennon. At the same time, he also helped to write Don't Stop The Music by Rihanna, which turned out to be a massive hit in 2007. ",

He would often cut tracks of this and then leave it for musicians and producers to fill in actual instrumentation where his hums stood.  He also would use mumbling in place of lyrics..   I feel that each of his songs were essentially cowritten with others due to this process and since he didn't really play any instruments himself he can't really be considered the whole author (but legally he can because of course everyone was paid so it seemed that way).  I would also suggest that Michael Jackson while probably writing most of the choruses of his songs probably had help in the verses.  I've seen dozens of interviews of the guy and he never seems quite as sophisticated as some of his lyrics. here is a link that gives a peek into his process The Incredible Way Michael Jackson Wrote Music | NME.COM  Here is an article that is rather interesting, that I agree with wholly   Who Really Wrote Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\"?

Quincy Jones was credited but it was Temperton who did most of the work . Thriller and off the wall were Temperton compositions but for some reason Quincy Jones was given more credit for Jacksons music than Temperton . American bias at work for my money. Just like the Beatles a revolution in music from the UK not america . Blue Suede Shoes , Hound Dog . Elvis versions were cover versions . Carl Perkins and Big Momma Thornton were the originals . Not an Elvis fan as with Queen and Freddie Mercury over rated for me . ",
