            "answer_text": "The key feature in choosing a digital good for you to start into entrepreneurship is to make sure, that it has a low error rate. When you are new to a market, you can\u2019t afford to get back every second sold product due to warranty or guarantee claims. Make sure, that if you buy digital goods from China, that you check these before hand, it is by far cheaper for you to check all your devices for two hours, than have the faulty ones returned to you, including shipping costs both ways and product handling costs. Second thing is the availability of the market you want to tap into. It can either not exist yet or be saturated. You want to absolutely avoid saturated markets, as you might have difficulties selling anything, without going below the prices of others (and you don\u2019t want to start fighting on prices with established companies, as they can often last /live longer on dumped prices than you). Entering a non-existing market can be hard, as you will need to first convince people to buy your product, as they most likely don\u2019t know it yet. This involves a higher marketing and commercial budget, that startups often don\u2019t have. The solution? Try tapping into a starting market. A product, that costs between $10 and $30 (so shipping costs won\u2019t matter too much, don\u2019t sell items for $0.10 with $2.90 shipping), has low potential to fail on you, has only a few people offering it, with worse conditions, less service or higher prices than you can offer.

If so, as a new entrepreneur interested in selling digital goods, I would recommend that you sell e-books, courses, videos, blogging services, graphics, and things of that nature. ",
