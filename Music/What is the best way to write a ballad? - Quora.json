            "answer_text": " Image: sk: Homemade almond extract and cherry pit vodka | CC BY-ND 2.0 Judging by the words of popular ballads, it helps to be rollicking drunk. One associates drinking songs with beer, but a jug of applejack will do. So would a wee drap of single malt scotch. The same goes for brandy and tequila. Legend has it that Janis Joplin wrote her best songs after swigs of Southern Comfort. When you\u2019re all set, hide your car keys, pour yourself a shot and listen to inspirational music to get in the mood. My former in-laws lived below the Mason-Dixon line, and liked songs like, \u201cThe year that Clayton Delaney died.\u201d I\u2019m partial to AC/DCs \u201cHave a drink on me.\u201d Whatever works for you should do it. The rest is easy: Grab a pencil and paper and channel those bat-winged phantoms flapping through the damp corridors of your brain. Good luck in your career as a balladeer. ",
