            "answer_text": "Take voice lessons. Inquire at your local music store if they have a contact for a teacher in the area. Inquire at a local church if the Music leader offers lessons or knows anyone who teaches lessons. If you are in school or college get into the music department and ask to take lessons. If they are full, ask if you can pay them to teach you on the side. You need lessons. You need someone who is trained in voice who can listen to you sing and tell you what you need to change to sound better. Even a few voice lessons will make a big difference. Another thing you can do is sing a lot. If you get lessons practice as much as possible (don\u2019t overdo it, be reasonable). If you don\u2019t get lessons, then watch professional singers on youtube. Listen to their sound and try to replicate it. Figure out what part you sing and find songs that are in that part. Try to follow the tips listed below to make your sound better. Open your mouth, drop your jaw. It will feel awkward but it makes the sound so much betterBreath from your diaphragm. Ever played a wind instrument or know someone who did ask them to teach you how they breathed.Don\u2019t sing through your nose. You do not want a nasally sound instead let the sound pass out of your mouth.Be confident. If you make a mistake fix it work on it keep going.Warm up. Find warmups on youtube that will warm up your voice and exercise it.I hope this helps! -Logan ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m always suspicious of questions like \u201chow long, how many hours, how many years\u201d. If you need an answer to \u2018how long\u2019 before you can commit to singing, find something else to do. Music, singing, self-expression/communication through your chosen art, are lifelong pursuits. If you\u2019re looking at your watch or your calendar to find out how much longer you have to endure the agony and tedium of self-improvement, this is not the life for you. This is not a frozen pizza: 35 minutes at 450\u00ba, and you get a nice, piping hot, powerful voice. You gotta make this from scratch. And you gotta learn to roll out the dough. And you gotta prepare the pizza sauce. And slice the ingredients. And grate the cheese. How short a period of time? Until your goal has been met. ",
