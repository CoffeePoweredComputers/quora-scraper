            "answer_text": "In m opinion these are the top 3 best rap albums of all time in no order: Efil4ZagginSlightly mysoginistic.Too many skits and long intros.Introduced G-Funk in the mainstream.Kind of dark, and intentionally messy, but a masterpiece.IllmaticNo complaints, but not crazy in any aspect.Villain in BlackInsane lyricism, and very dark.G-Funk type beats.Here\u2019s a song on each: N.W.A. - Niggaz4Life  I rate this song 10/10. The whole song is loaded with wordplay, facts, cases of racial profiling, and reality. This song discusses why N.W.A. call themselves \u201cNiggaz Wit\u2019 Attitudes,\u201d and will continue to call themselves \u201cniggaz\u201d \u2019til they die (even though Real Niggaz Don\u2019t Die). Each verse tells a new story or reason, similar to a debate with the public who disagrees with their logic. \u201cWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me? Because police always wanna harass me Every time that I'm rollin They swear up and down that the car was stolen Make me get face down in the street And throw the shit out my car on the concrete In front of a residence A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President\u201d Nas - Halftime  Personally, I\u2019d say this is the best song on Illmatic, but others don\u2019t agree. This song sounds fantastic, it\u2019s got great delivery, and dope lyricism. Out of 10, I\u2019d give it a flat 9/10. \u201cI used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5 I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\u201d MC Ren feat. Bigg Rocc - Mind Blown  This song Ren displays great flow, lyricism, and has a similar sound to What\u2019s Beef? by the Notorious B.I.G. This track I give a 9.5/10, because it\u2019s dug very deep. It predicts that the rap game will be filled with artists who don\u2019t put effort in their songs\u2014who just dream one night of being a rapper and drop a song the next morning\u2014Ren describes how he tortures them in his distinct, dark, lair. \u201cI'm shockin motherfuckers like water and a live wire Makin niggas feel the fire like Richard Pryor The Great Elephant, the Bitch Made Nigga Killa I'm steppin\u2019 on you niggas like a Godzilla\u201d That\u2019s what I think. Obviously, music is subjective. Hope I helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Best is pretty subjective so you\u2019re bound to get a gazillion answers. If you mean single (and not album), one of the most impressive (and underrated) singles ever issued on Sugarhill Records was The Mean Machine\u2019s \u201cDisco Dream\u201d (1981). The composition is tight, the rhymes are on time, and the recording captures the spirit of audience participation which, at that point, was a hallmark of the scene as it had been developing. Peace!
