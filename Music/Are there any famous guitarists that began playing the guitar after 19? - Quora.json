            "answer_text": "Well, he isn't all that famous but his guitar playing is very,very well known. I mean so well known that you would have had to spend your whole life living in a bunker that was a mile beneath the ice sheet in Antarctica and also be deaf to not have heard his guitar playing. His name is Tommy Tedesco and he played on countless famous songs. Everybody has heard his guitar work. Whether it was from a tv show theme like Bonanza or Green Acres or from the scores of songs that he played on in the 60s and 70s such as Good Vibrations or...the list is too long so you can look him up if that interests you. Anyway he was 23 or something close to that when he first picked up the guitar. He was a member of a group of studio musicians that were unofficially called The Wrecking Crew. It also included drummer Hal Blaine, Bassist Carol Kaye and guitar player extrordinaire Glen Campbell. Yes that Glen Campbell. They were like the west coast version of the Funk Brothers, who were the backing band for basically every old Motown song you've ever heard. The Funk Brothers had what many people consider to be, myself included, one of the best bass players to have ever lived. James Jamerson. I don't know what their ages were when they learned to play their instruments, but I do know this. You are young. You can pick up a guitar at 30,40,50 or 60 and still get good. You are just barely out of diapers. So don't let your age be an excuse, because honestly, if you are dedicated enough and willing to put the practice in, you could be a great player by the time your 21. It's true and all up to you. I'm sure there are a few people who are just naturally gifted, but the vast majority of us were awkward clumsy spastics when we started. So don't get discouraged. Just power on through and you'll get good. I promise. ",

I find that guitarists (especially guys) have this crazy competitive streak in them and are approaching music from the wrong angle. They want to 'get there' so badly that they miss the whole point of making music in the first place. Maybe this isn't you, maybe you're just researching guitarists for interest's sake, who knows.  If you are feeling down on yourself though, relax dude! This may sound lame, but really, after wasting many years of playing anxiously, hoping to impress others, I look back and say to myself, 'Why didn't I just have fun with it?!' You're in the position now to do that - don't miss it.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is more about how hard you work than at which age you start.  As an example it is amazing how Pat Martino re-started his guitarist career after losing playing ability due to a brain aneurysm. It took him 4 years to play again and 3 more to record \"The Return\", his comeback album. This happened when he was 40. Later he released an album dedicated to Wes Montgomery as a tribute to the music that helped him come back. The key point is how much time you can/will dedicate to practice. A good teacher is also a must, only the naturals can progress efficiently without some coaching. ",

If you do not have that then you cannot play or convey through an instrument any feeling or evoke emotional response. I like excellent guitar playing and simplicity as well. I tire of the competitive types who  exhibit what Frank Zappa called \"lick spewage\".  A dozen white middle aged men playing blues is interesting only to themselves and they think the world loves it. Gramps With Amps I call it. If you want to learn you will but the hard work is turning you off  so I suggest that you pack it in and not waste your time, there are many things to do in life and playing uninspired music is not one at the top of my list! Go to youtube and watch Richard Thompson play \"Vincent Black Lightning\". That will either make you quit or get busy, it is up to you. And forget about fame. ",
