            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request and would gladly answer this question to the best of my ability. Crap, why did that sound so professional wtf, cough, anywho lets begin RM\u2019s Solid Blue Blue is the color of trust and peace. Also loyalty and integrity, conservatism and frigity. i dont know if they just chose random colors, but I mean I would think they mean something to them, and I know trust and peace means alot to RM. From a color physcology perspective, blue is reliable and responsible. (this is speaking RM already) You can rely on it to take control and do the right thing in difficult times. (claps hands together) well that cant get true enough:)  , Jin Hot Pink Glitter Say no more. Jin is the literal definition of pink. we all know this man loves his pink. I think a part of it is its his favorite color! Boy With Luv has proved pink aint just for woman anymore, Jin has taken it over lol. He really kills wearing pink, really pink has become a unisex color and hey thanks to Jin fanboys are probably more comfortable wearing it! For the actually meaning of the color he has, the more root definition. Pink is a combination of red and white. One cannot make pink without the other, they need each other to reach potential and success. It is the passion and power of the red softened by the purity, opensess and completeness of white. The deeper the pink, the more passion it has. I think im more leaning towards he chose it cause he loves pink haha  Suga Pitch Black I have to say, It suits him. Very well. Its our boy Suga, we definitly cant see him coming out with bright yellow or something like that now can we. Black might seem boring, but remember, the stars shine brightest the darker the night is:) I think Suga has a meaning behind the color he chose, although I know 75 percent of his wardrobe consists of black clothing\u2026but besides the point! Black is the color of the hidden, the secretive, the unkown, mysterious, it keeps emotions bottled up inside! Creating a barrier between itself and the outside world, providing comfort to those it cares about while protecting its emotions and feelings. hides its insecuritits, vulnerablities, lacks self confidence. Wow, we went pretty deep their. i mean it sorta sounds like suga, just not so dark haha. He is more quiet and doesnt let his emotions show much and is loving towards people he cares about:)  J-Hope Shimmery Silver Although I would think orange or yellow would fit our sunshine Hobi better, silver is great also. White silverish suits his pure image, but when the light hits and reflects the shine, it shows bad boy Jay comin through lol. The meaning behind silver is with its reflective and sensitive qualities, it also inspires intuition. It reflects back any energy given out, wether its positive or negative. It also seen as a glamorous color, also sophisticated:)  Jimin Gold Gold=Expensive. Not only expensive in a materialistic way, but also its whole existence is worthy. Jimin is that one person everyone needs in their life and wants. He is the dream best friend people crave. That supportive friend that hypes up every members ideas to make them feel worthy and amazing and needed. This sounds so much like Jimin. Gold was the color for him definitely. Gold is the color of success, achievement. and triumph. Associated with abundance, luxury, and quality. Value, elegance, and extravagance. Yup. That's our mochi:)  V Jungle Green Green, our nature boy Taehyung. Growing up in the countryside with his grandma, no wonder he loves nature so much. It can be seen through his photographs, and how he loves throwing his shoes off, cause hey its more comfortable lol. The deep root meaning of green is growth, the color of spring, renewal, and birth. It renews and restores depleted energy. it is the sanctuary away from the stresses of modern living, restoring itself back to a sense of well being. People this is why we are surrounded by green, we need it. There is so much of this relaxing color on this earth and it needs to stay that way.  Jungkook Plum Purple The color of BTS, I honestly was surprised he didn't pick a color like red, but after you read the meaning of what purple is, it makes way more sense. The color purple relates to the imagination and spirituality. It stimulates the imagination and inspires high dreams and wishes that they are determined to fulfill. (ahh making more sense) It's a introspective color, allowing us to get into deeper touch with our thoughts. The color relates to the fantasy world, a common daydreamer that loves to escape from reality. (that's why jungshook was born everyone)  So yeah! I hope everyone liked my answer, and it was interesting. Interesting was what I was going for haha so I hope u enjoyed it. Thanks for the request:) Ava ",

            "answer_text": "Both my parents are singers. And my dad has even been a part of a band for a few years. The secret behind why they have different mic colors.. ready for it!It\u2019s because they need to have it that way because they are in a group. Yup, that\u2019s why folks. So when you are a group and don\u2019t have much money you actually can\u2019t afford to get different colored mics. But they are very necessary as each singer has a different voice, tone, loudness, and quite a few other things that factor into the microphone and its little microphone settings. Normally, when you don\u2019t have a bunch of money for custom microphones and cases you can lug around the world with you everywhere. You can put a little piece of tape or a little tag on your temporary microphone that has been customed tuned as best it can to your settings. Now sound engineers will do this for you as they attempt to get the settings as good as they can in the little time they have to get to know you. But yeah since there are seven boys with seven different voices and tones they do this so that they know and the sound guys know whose microphone is whose. Have you ever noticed that when a microphone dies and someone lends someone else their mic instead that it sounds off, or not as good? That is because the microphone is tweaked and tuned specifically for that person's voice and preferences. So while the mic works for another person, it just won\u2019t ever sound as great. And the thing is it takes sometimes days or months to figure out the tuning and tweaks to make a microphone your own. And you don\u2019t want to have to reset that up every time. So the fact is they bring their own mics with them. And these mics are set up perfectly to match their voices. So that they can sound the best they can be on stage. To do this and make the best possible performance for you guys they have to have some way to differentiate their microphones apart. So they use colors. A very standard practice in the industry. So with how rich they are, they have fully colored mics so that there will be no confusion on this matter. Some people who don\u2019t have as much money can use electrical tape, colored rings, colored covers, handle wrappers, or microphone jewels. These colors themself is something BTS picked probably based on their own preferences\u2026 But the meaning behind them all having their own different colored mics and not all say white or black is literally so Jin doesn\u2019t take Tae\u2019s mic or vice versa. Actually a fun example of this if you ever want to keep an eye out for it is. if you ever see a bunch of idols on stage and someone goes and starts talking then looks confused and looks at their mic, then another idol comes up to them and hands them the mic they have. Yuppers you guessed it, they stole each other's mics and are probably thinking, WTH is up with my mic. Artists trading mics. 99% of the time this is because they grabbed the microphone that was calibrated for someone else voice. the other 1% of the time is if the mic is dead. Most of the time when this happens they just laugh it off and thank each other especially if they are int the same group. It\u2019s not a big deal after all. So the answer to why they have different colors. Is because they are rich they can afford to differentiate their mic in a pleasing way for themselves but that is noticeable for the workers/staff and other members there too. Fans can just enjoy the visuals though and think about the fun color-matching to their personality instead. Because it is true they probably all picked colors they like. But, Yeah, ALL singers would have custom microphones if they could afford them. Because it is necessary for all singers to have one if they want their voice to sound the best it can be. Of course, they can use a standard mic set to any setting, but it just isn\u2019t going to sound the same. I hope that helped answer the question. XD ",
