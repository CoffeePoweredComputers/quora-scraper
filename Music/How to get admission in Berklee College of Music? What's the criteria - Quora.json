You can actually get the most updated edition requirements from their website. Berklee College of Music One suggestion, though. If you\u2019ve never taken any formal music instruction before, I would suggest that you take some classes at a local community college near you. Or, at the very least, find a private instructor to work with for a period of time. The work can be very difficult if one is in used to study music in a formal environment.

Are you someone that can learn, grow, be molded, but also break the mold and make your own? Are you a worthy investment? So yes, be good. Work your butt off before you get there and while you\u2019re there. But in my personal experience, they want someone who will find their Berklee experience invaluable because the school was able to unlock a whole lot of potential that the student (and others) may not have even known was there. It\u2019s abstract, I know, but I think it holds true. They will invest in those individuals who seem to have a lot of potential. They\u2019re not always looking for perfection. ",
