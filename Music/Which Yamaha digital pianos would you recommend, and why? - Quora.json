            "answer_text": " Yamaha has over a hundred different electronic keyboards, and we included 5 in our recent review of about a dozen digital pianos - Best Portable Electronic Piano Keyboard To keep this answer brief, here are our top 2 favorites, and you can read more about them in the article link above. Yamaha P115 88-Key Weighted Action Portable Digital Piano ($600) - this one has just about everything you\u2019d want whether you are a beginner or an accomplished player. It\u2019s suitable for home use and professional performances. Some high lights for this piano are: \u201cGHS\u201d (Graded Hammer Standard) weighted 88-keys \u2013 heavier in the low end and lighter in the high end, just like an acoustic piano.\u201cPure CF Sound Engine\u201d for acoustic processor where sampling is based on Yamaha\u2019s acclaimed 9\u2032 CFIIIS concert grand piano.\u201cPianist Styles\u201d which can turn your simple chords into accompaniment tracks.192-note polyphony, 4 demo songs and player recordable 50 piano songs (100 KB per song, approx. 11,000 notes).Another favorite is the Yamaha P71 88-Key Weighted Action Digital Piano ($400) - it comes with the same keyboard action (\u201cGHS\u201d), but a different sampling process for it\u2019s sound. Still very good, just different - so you may prefer the P71 to the P115. At about $200 less, you get few features: 10 different voices, 64 polyphonics; Reverbs (4) and the 1 Metronome. In the review mentioned above, we have a great video to compare the P71 and the P115 to see which may be best for your skill level, requirements, sound preference, etc. Give this an Upvote if it helped you out - many thanks from Team SourceTech411 ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of musician and Pianist are you? What experience are you in piano? Beginner? Intermediate? Hip Hop Producer? Film Score Composer? Enthusiast? Do you intend to use the keyboard to play covers to popular Top 40 songs or to practice ridiculous Scriabin Sonatas? What's your price range? Are we talking CPX, Disklavier, or Clarinova systems? Also, just in general, why Yamaha (Yamaha is great, but depending on your needs, there are other brands and models at dramatically different price points to consider.)? Given the range of Yamaha\u2019s line of digital and acoustic instruments, you'll need to clarify some of these specific aspects. If you do that, I'll do my best to update this draft with something that adequately answers your question. ",
