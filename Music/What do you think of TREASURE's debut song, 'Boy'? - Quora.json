            "answer_text": "Ok first of all, I am a VIP, Blackjack, BLINK, and IC. I did not watch the Treasure Box show so I only looked at the MV itself and I also listened to Bang YeDam's WAYO and I liked it. When I looked at their MV I wasn't impressed. Nothing and no one in particular stood out to me. It was nothing new or different. There was no unique choreography despite having 13 members. And the chorus/EDM drop sounded way too much like BLACKPINK's How You Like That. But I can admit it was quite a bop and would actually add the song to my playlist. I hope YG will not mismanage this time and I also hope that they will have more comebacks in the future, unlike BLACKPINK. Tbh, no hate but I don't like the group's name and debut song because it was too generic! When people who haven't heard of the group will think of TREASURE as Bruno Mars' song, Treasure. ",

Well personally I wasn't expecting this type of debut song but this song was literally above my expectations. The thing which was the best I like was that their own rap line ( Hyunsuk, Haruto and Yoshi ) has written this song. The lyrics are so beautiful. I am totally impressed by their debut song.
