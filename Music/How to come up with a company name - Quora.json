            "answer_text": "I'll take this question literally, and assume that the question is asking *how* to come up with a name, as in what method should one use, rather than how do we decide if a name is good. 1. I strongly recommend starting with good old fashioned research. Make sure you know your business, your region, the competitive landscape, your one ideal target customer, your relationship to this moment in time, and your company's \"personality,\" before you think about a name. The more you fill your brain with relevant information, the better your search for the right name will turn out. 2. Consider hiring outside help. I admit I'm biased, both because of how much problematic naming I see and because of how I've seen improved naming help to turn around faltering businesses, but I really do believe that this is one of those steps that has such long-term effects that it's worth not going it alone. Like accounting. Or insurance. Or medicine. Only in the case of naming, everyone thinks it looks so easy that anyone can do it well. A great name is a leg-up in the early stages and your first and best advertisement for the life of the business. Like your graphics, your interiors, your coding, your packaging, etc.... it's worth having professional experience on your side. 3. The main answer for you (and for the professionals you work with, if you do) is brainstorming. Write down everything about your company. About your vision, your mission, your goals, your \"big picture,\" your attitude or vibe, what's good about your field of work and bad about it, your snarky opinions of the competition. Write down everything you want the company to be now, everything you're aiming for it to be in five-ten-fifty years, everything you hope will make your customers most happy about working with you, everything you know they want and want to pay for... keep going in this way, using #1 to make your brainstorming list just as long as you can.  Then put it aside for a couple of days. A week, if you have the luxury of time. Look for the things that grab you\u2014that evoke emotion\u2014pain, joy, a fit of the giggles... the memorable, distinctive, descriptive words or phrases that could only apply to you (your company).  Begin to make the name more clear, so anyone can understand what you do. Make it even more evocative, so a brand-new customer will know why they want what you have and why they want to buy it from you. When you've pushed the process as far as you can and you have 3 fantastic names, start getting outside opinions from likely buyers. You may wind up right back at the drawing board, but you'll know exactly why\u2014people love to give their opinions. You're done when your name pushes buttons on the right customers, and gets those customers to take the next step to learn more about you, walk in (or click through), and consider buying from you.  P.S. I rarely link to my work outside of Quora, but in this case I'll make an exception because I've explored naming in much more depth on my blog: I've been told that the articles in my Naming Your Business 101 series have helped readers and clients a great deal when they're working on new business/ service/ product names. If you're working on a new name, those articles may give you some new tools for your brainstorming arsenal. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll show you how I did it. First, let\u2019s do a word association exercise. Write a list of words, ideally 3\u20136 characters per word, that associate with the product or service your business will be offering. Let\u2019s say your product allows users to book flights online (as did mine). Your word list might look something like this:  Got your word list? Good. This next step isn\u2019t a must and you can avoid it if you don\u2019t find any utility within the idea. But personally, I think the new trend of suffixing or prefixing your word with a small number of characters is quite a powerful idea. Think Spotify, Bitly, Mashable, etc. This isn't just to follow the trend, rather it will help you find a name that isn't taken. Write down a list of as many as you can think of. I got the following:  Take as much time with the above two exercises as possible as they will feed directly into the quality of name you come up with. Once you have the two lists, you can simply try combining the words and prefixes/suffixes to create portmanteaus. The short character length constraint I specified at the start of this answer helps ensure the new words aren\u2019t too long, remain pronounceable, and are also relevant to what the product or service is about. In my case, I found the following four names to be the most promising that were still available as .com domains.  Once you\u2019ve got your final list of names to chose from, you should come up with a criteria to rank the names as objectively as possible, and so that you can keep your personal preferences out of it. The following criteria was most important to me and is therefore what I used:  The Result: Wayhopper.com To conclude, I\u2019d say that it is surely possible to come up with greater and greater business names the more time you\u2019re allowing yourself to spend on it. There is no doubt that if you spend 6 months just on coming up with a name, you will have the best name around - but a competitor who spent less time on the name and more time executing the idea might well get a lot farther ahead. If you\u2019re just starting a business it\u2019s also worth keeping in mind mostly no-one is going to hear about your idea for some time anyway. Companies with millions of users have managed successful name transitions so what makes you think the name you select as a start up with 0 users has to be permanent? It is most important that you move fast. ",
