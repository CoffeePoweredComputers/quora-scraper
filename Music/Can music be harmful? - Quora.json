            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean. 1.) If you mean music with lyrics, certainly a given song might be interpreted by a dangerous person. Charles Manson referenced my favorite band, the Beatles, viz. \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d as predicting the inter-racial war he sought. Now in truth we can\u2019t say it \u2018caused\u2019 anything - Manson was already set on the idea before the White album, but it may have acted as a catalyst. I love the song - it is arguably the first \u2018metal\u2019 song - it certainly paved the way for heavy metal and would have sounded very extreme at the time. So, music can bring out all kinds of emotions, but in fairness, it\u2019s not the song\u2019s fault that it quickens the revealing of evil.  2.) Without lyrics, there is a very real danger with any music that is played too loud for a long time: Hearing damage, which cannot be reversed. So, music itself certainly can be dangerous, as with any loud sounds. 3.) On a more disturbing and (admittedly) speculative note, loud music on headphones, usually metal, has been used by various states when torturing prisoners. Hearing damage aside, what I propose as dangerous is the psychological conditioning as a side effect. An ex-prisoner may react in completely unpredictable ways if they hear similar music in the \u2018normal\u2019 world, which they invariably will at some point. I\u2019d be interested if anyone is aware of research into this. ",

            "answer_text": "That is quite a question. Subjective of course. \u2026 it has saved my life, and I have a relationship with music. Can it be dangerous? Let\u2019s break that down. We have 5 senses. -smell, taste, hearing, seeing, touch Let\u2019s start with smelling. It\u2019s an honest sense, of you smell something bad. It is bad. Right? Taste, a little less honest with the \u2018foods\u2019 nowadays. Seeing. Not so honest. Red berries look amazing, but, occasionally are poisonous. Look in nature to see how sight can be misleading. Touch. What do you think? I would say honest. If it hurts, your body is warning you. Yes, some of us enjoy pain etc. so I guess this is open to interpretation. (As everything is) Hearing. Honest. If you hear a lion raw you know you in trouble, your instinct tells you that. Now, can music be dangerous? I guess we can ask, cab silence be dangerous? I think music is a gift and a comfort. Even with an obsession with music or a song, I\u2019m trying to think how \u2018music\u2019 it\u2019s self is dangerous. Long answer\u2026 no. I don\u2019t think music is dangerous. Oooo, wait, side note. In medieval times. Things seemed to be based on fear, and tradition. Formalities one might say. Some of the musicians who were ahead of their time, challenging the current musical boundaries were hung, and heart at the stake, for incorporating a flat fifth into their music. Which sounds really evil, but is commonly used in jazz music. Google the devils tri-tone if you are interested. ",

At night you shouldn't be listening to music because it makes you less aware of your surroundings like if there is a fire, you wouldn't be as attentive. If you are listening to loud music, it can hurt your ears and possibly make you deaf. Also some music that has language can affect your actions. Finally listening to music while walking outside if very dangerous because with your headphones on, you're less aware of your surroundings.  ",

            "answer_text": "Walking alongside a crowded street with headphones on can be more dangerous than not having them on, even if they're not excessively loud, just because of the decreased situational awareness. Blaring the music in the car can make you miss sirens, or distract you from what should be your main task, driving. Music can also be used as an appealing \"hook\" to something more sinister, such as propaganda or psychological manipulation. It's not the fault of the music, but we can find ourselves in worse positions because someone uses our love of the music against us. ",

            "answer_text": "Music becomes harmful when it departs from classical principles, and is heard loudly. The human ear works best at inputs of 45db, and with peaks at 65db SPL. Music heard through ear pods violates these principles and damages hearing. Damaged ears will not be felt initially but the volume levels will rise slowly further damaging your organs including the nerve array, and brain processing mechanisms. These are irreversible processes, which means you will never enjoy music in its raw form again! ",
