            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the problem that frankly I've become annoyed with. People are constantly complicating classical music. They\u2019re so hung up on classical form and making music unique with and making their music so atonal that it\u2019s no longer is music. That\u2019s why i like this question. You see, the question is, \u201cWhat can classical music teach you?\u201d. lets look back at the great composers of the 18th and 19th centuries. they took very simple yet beautiful melodies, and through harmonies and repetition, they create masterpieces. Take beethoven\u2019s 5th symphony, an iconic piece that\u2019s bound to send chills down your spine, but when you take it a part for what it really it, it kind of seems comical and painfully simple. It\u2019s two different notes being played over and over and over and over again, but it is how he develops his melody with those two seemingly simple notes that is ingenious. He layers harmonies and melodies and more melodies on top of each other until the orchestra explodes in immense power, with every instrument in unison. Beethoven composed for orchestra like it was one instrument. His music was not annoying or atonal in any way. It was simple and melodic, yet it didn't lack dissidents and power. Classical music teaches us that simplicity is key and that through repetition and development, beautiful melody can be achieved. ",
