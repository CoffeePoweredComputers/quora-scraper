            "answer_text": "Yes, but no. Traditional horns are almost never used in marching bands. Their circular shape and special method of holding them make them very difficult to march with. But, there are two instruments that I\u2019ve seen that are used in their place. My high school band marched mellophones, which look a bit like a large trumpet. They\u2019re slightly different in fingerings from the horn, but they\u2019re in the same key and sound quite similar. My university band uses marching horns, which are similar to the mellophone but are a little bigger and use a horn mouthpiece. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes except in marching bands they don\u2019t use the normal french horns that are circularly shaped. They use marching horns which are more like large trumpets and have mostly different fingerings from a regular french horn (I\u2019m pretty sure). Also they kind of need french horns in marching bands for there to be a balance in the sound because if you have too many woodwinds, your sound as a group is more \u201ctop-heavy\u201d so ideally you want more brass players to even out the sound.
