            "answer_text": "Jazz is complicated music, so if you want it to be authentic there isn\u2019t a simple answer. But if you\u2019re just trying to give it a jazz flavor, there are a few things you can try. Pop/rock/blues/folk music uses a lot of triads, simple major and minor chords. Jazz uses next to none. So use maj7 chords instead of majors, and m7 chords instead of minors. The chords with tension in most styles of music are simple dominant seventh chords. Jazz tends to use a lot of altered dominants\u2026 so instead of using a C7, you can use C7#5, C7b5, C7b9 or C7#9. Only the 7#9 is used in any rock music - Hendrix used it frequently, and a few other bands have used it sporadically. Those will give you more of the harmonic feeling you get from jazz without having to learn tons of theory - it takes years of woodshedding to really \u201cget\u201d jazz harmony. But with those chords as a starting point, you might want to ask what kind of jazz you want to sound like. Guitars in big band style jazz tend to play on the beat, and they play \u201csmall\u201d voicings - it\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cFreddie Green style\u201d of guitar, after Count Basie\u2019s guitarist. Freddie would typically play just three notes. If it was a C7 chord he might play 8x89xxx (C-Bb-E). Modal styles of jazz often use two chord stabs to the bar, with one placed in between beats - play on the \u201cone\u201d and then the \u201cand\u201d of two (or the \u201cand\u201d of three). Fusion grooves might use odd time signatures, like 7 beats per measure. And in some styles other chord structures will be used - if you\u2019re trying to sound like McCoy Tyner or Chick Corea, you might use a lot of 7sus chords. So take those tips, listen to a lot of jazz that appeals to you, and experiment. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not just about the chords, but about the structure of the progression, the tensions and the passing chords. In this post I\u2019m just going to talk about the structure. There are many ways to think a chord progression, I\u2019m going to tell you just one of those many ways. Modal implication One of the things that drove me crazy when I was a student was the common answer that some teachers gave to every question: \u201cJazz is modal\u201d. Oh, I see that there are many songs that really take modal composition techniques. But how to understand songs in which there are perfect cadences, the chords are related with orthodox tonal relations and there\u2019s tonal unity? Well, one of the ways to understand some of those pieces is that they are tonal but with strong modal implications. In classical music the main phrase of a theme usually starts on the I (or i), so by closing with a perfect authentic cadence to I, classical themes have a strict tonal structure. This is not necessarily the case of jazz music. Let\u2019s put it in this way: you can start a jazz progression in any chord degree of the scale, but at the end of the main theme you are going to close it with a V-I cadence. When working this way, jazz musicians usually avoid the V in the first downbeat of the theme. So let\u2019s say you begin in ii, but you finish it with a cadence to the I. So you have a tonal progression but the theme has a modal implication (because the basic idea is in a dorian form). Let\u2019s see an example\u2026 This is the chord progression of the first 16 bars of Satin Doll: Dm7 | G7 | Em7 | A7 | Am7 D7 | Abm7 Db7 | Cmaj7 | Em A7 | Dm7 | G7 | Em7 | A7 | Am7 D7 | Abm7 Db7 | Cmaj7 | % || Please look for the standard in any Real Book that you have. The theme repeats in bar 9, and the only difference between the first time and the repetition is the turn around in measure 8. So what do we have here? Some people would explain that Dm7 is the i, but that doesn\u2019t explain the tonal unity of the piece. A better explanation is that the basic idea starts in the ii of C and we have a cadence to C in measures 6\u20137 and 14\u201315, so the song is in Cmaj, but the theme begins in a dorian form. So let\u2019s analyze the theme: Measures 1\u20132: Basic idea Measures 3\u20134: Repetition of the basic idea in a model-sequence repetition (everything is transported: the melody and the harmonic progression) Measure 5: Fragmentation: The harmonic rate is duplicated, instead of one chord per measure, now we have two chords per measure. Measure 6\u20137: Cadence using tritone substitution. Instead of playing ii - V, the chords are substituted with those at a distance of a tritone: bvi7 - bII7. Anyway, the bII7 represents V leading to tonic. Measure 8: Turn around: You need something that takes you back to measure 1 to start the theme again. A ii - V progression to Dm will do the trick. Measure 16: As long as you are not going back to Dm, you don\u2019t need a turn around anymore. To stay on I is a possibility that works well as a more definitive ending. Do you see how it works? Do you see the geometry of the structure? This is important: The main idea last two measures, then it\u2019s repeated, so we have an initial structure of 4 measures. On measure 5 and 6 the harmonic rate doubles. We can clearly divide the first 8 measures in two phrases of 4 measures each, and we can divide each phrase in two segments of two measures each. The structure of the main theme of Satin Doll is called Sentence, which is a very common thematic type used profusely by classic and romantic composers. The structure of a sentence is the following: A two measures basic idea that last two bars.The immediate repetition of the basic idea in the following two measures. The repetition can be exact or transposed; the melodic contour can be transposed or adapted, but it\u2019s a repetition.A fragmentation of the idea in measures 5 and 6.A cadential closure.But a Jazz Sentence has some other features: You can begin on any mode of the tonality, but usually you\u2019ll avoid the V in the first downbeat.As long as you don\u2019t begin in tonic, a turn around that takes you to the initial chord is welcome at the end of the first time the theme is played.A turn around is a progression that leads to the initial chord, commonly the turn around finishes with a ii - V progression.Chords that have a strong pull to the next chord (dominants, secondary dominants and diminished chords) are usually placed in weaker beats or weaker measures than the resolution. Weak beats are weak in relation to the resolution (i.e. the third beat is weaker than the first beat; a second measure is weaker than the 3rd measure). This is not a rule of thumb but let\u2019s say that it\u2019s a common feature of most jazz songs.So here you are. This is just one example of one thematic type. There are many other structures, but you can apply this concepts to build some cool progressions. Good luck ",
