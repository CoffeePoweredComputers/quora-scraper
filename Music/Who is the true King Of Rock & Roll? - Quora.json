As to who really started rock and roll, there are many candidates, from Buddy Holly to Chuck Berry to Little Richard to Eddie Cochran. My vote, it I had to pick one, is CHUCK BERRY. He started it all: Songwriter: Wrote intelligent, even poetic, teen songs. Performer: Sang his songs very well, using the ELECTRIC GUITAR for strumming and solos. He really set up the rock and roll sound and song style as we know it. He played guitar in a way approaching today\u2019s rockers, and this was in the 50\u2019s. He strutted across that stage, he sang about school, dancing all night, guitar players, rock and roll fans etc. CHUCK BERRY. \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d and \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d are songs for all time!!! ",

            "answer_text": "There is only one. The one and only Elvis \u2018the Pelvis\u2019 Presley, long considered the King of Rock & Roll. My favorite singer as a youth, which hasn\u2019t truly swayed any other way, though my tastes have changed. He was the first to bring rock n roll mainstream, with legions of fans, and Col. Tom Parker running his show\u2026\u2026he skyrocketed to the top where he stayed more or less until his death\u2026\u2026.he may have gotten tubby in his later years, but his voice never left him\u2026\u2026.was hard to watch at the end somewhat, but not to hear. He was an exciting sexy man with a voice to die for with a sense of humor to go with his karate chops. Elvis Presley is the King of Rock & Roll. Thats why Michael Jackson took King of Pop, cuz rock was already taken. ",
