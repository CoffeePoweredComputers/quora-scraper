            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably that with age you have developed the patience needed to appreciate the classical works. Typical \u2018pop\u2019 tunes only last around three minutes, and listeners become accustomed to that pace, so when they\u2019re faced with classical works that may take far longer than that just to get through the introduction, they just don\u2019t have the attention span to appreciate the more expansive themes. Classical works also tend to deal with more complex and nuanced emotions, that involve different areas of the brain. The aim of classical works is often totally different from popular music, although there is a place for both. To paraphrase Leonard Bernstein, pop music is in the entertainment business, whereas classical music is in the beauty business. While that is an oversimplification, it\u2019s more or less accurate. One thing is fairly certain though \u2014 it\u2019s probably not just a phase. Once you\u2019ve found the pleasure of classical works, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll ever lose that appreciation. What you may find however, is that your taste may continue to develop, to include other genres and new composers. For example, it\u2019s often noted that Brahms\u2019 music in particular, may not appeal readily to the young but is typically appreciated more deeply later in life. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is a question of maturity. Look at it this way: you start out in life, as a kid, reading comic books. Some people never get past this phase. Others begin to branch out- they start reading magazines and books. Some others begin to enlarge their horizons. They start reading the classics of literature- Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Hemingway, and countless others. They have left the comic book readers far behind. Some others discover Shakespeare, and they find Hamlet or Macbeth enjoyable and thrilling.I think in your case it is a matter of maturity and intellect. Maybe this example will enlighten you: often, when I have had occasion to visit a scientist or a professor in his or her office, and the radio was on, they were more likely to be listening to classical music rather than hip-hop. Maybe now you know why. Good luck.You have a wonderful voyage of discovery ahead of you. ",
