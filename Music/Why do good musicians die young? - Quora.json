            "answer_text": "Good musicians are good musicians for a reason. Good musicians do not simply play music. They feel. Passion is something that any good musician will have. Without passion, there is no drive to create the expressive and powerful music that they do. Think of your favourite song. Why do you like it? The most likely answer is because it makes you feel something. It could remind you of the best day of your life, or a loved one. It could even remind you of one of the most horrible experiences you\u2019ve ever had, because that musician had done their job so well that they had made you strong enough to overcome that experience through the artistic expression of notes and lyrics. In order to write and perform as passionately as they do, musicians must go through enough difficulties and obstacles themselves to truly feel the pain, exhilaration, anxiety or any other emotions influenced by life experiences to trigger them into writing that song. These life experiences are likely to take a toll on their health, mainly through stress. The stress could pressure them into drug or substance abuse, depression, chronic stress could even lead to anxiety with heart and nervous problems. This could explain why many of our recent greatest musicians have died heartbreakingly young. The stress from these life experiences had pushed them beyond their limit. For these artists to connect with their listeners as best they can, they must have gone through incredibly difficult experiences to be able to create a piece of music that will be able to touch the hearts of so many people. Simply put: Good musicians die young because the experiences they had to endure to produce their music can be deadly. The silver lining is that generations of people will be able to appreciate the silver lining of what these experiences have created: glorious music to bring people together. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. I have an approximate theory. For one, musicians are typically young adult males who are predisposed probably for hormonal reasons to die young as a demographic. Dopamine may play an important role. I\u2019m a fairly shy/to-myself, but creative dude. It often takes what seems like dopamine for me to become disinhibited enough to share things. An example is this Monday I used sleep deprivation + high insulin (a lot of chocolate) to keep my motivation high. Like alcohol, dopamine can increase motivation + disinhibition in useful ways but has the potential to lead to really bad choices in life etc. It could potentially spiral into addiction. There may be a link with creativity and mental illnesses (known as \u201cschizotypy\u201d). Shy or overtaxed performers with anxiety issues sometimes basically try to hack dopamine levels to do their thing better, but this can be risky especially as seen with benzos or similar drugs (or usually bad drug combos in general): Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, MJ, Elvis, Prince. RIP. Perhaps this prosocial thing gone awry, dopamine, could also relate to some other weird celebrity things like Bowie's Nazi phase, Elon Musk calling good guys pedos on Twitter (in retrospect Ambien may have played a big role), maybe some guys with alcohol problems being abusive like Johnny Depp.  ",
