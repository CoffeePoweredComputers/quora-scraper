            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll Ty and narrow it down: (In no particular order) The messages and substance of their music. Ever since their debut they have addressed social and political issues in their lyrics (Eg. The harsh education system, the gap between rich and poor, the pressures placed on our generation, mental illness, struggling with identity - but ultimately spreading the message of chasing your dreams and self acceptance/love.) This is an incredibly rare occurrence in Korea and even in Western Societys. This has had a positive impact on so many people\u2019s lives,leading them to feel more connected to their music.Their involvement in the creative process. (I know this can be said for other Kpop groups as well but not the majority) The members are so involved in the writing, composing, producing and even choreographing for the majority of their songs. (Especially seen in the Rapline, who have hundreds of songs under their name - with help from their company of course) Many of the other popular Kpop groups are from bigger industries who tend to place more restrictions and have specific standards for releasing music. (This ties in with PT 1 - their music seems more genuine)The access to personalities and lives of members. I think this is a crucial differentiating factor (between casual listeners and avid/loyal fans) Because fans are able to have so much access to the members lives (through Bangtan bombs, Run eps, Bon Voyage, Summer Packages, Talk Shows/Interviews etc.) We are able to get to know them as people and develop a stronger connection to them. You get to witness their bond as a group, see how humble and down to earth they are, see their silly sides but also their vulnerable sides. They aren\u2019t seen as the \u2018polished and proper\u2019 celebrities like others in the industry, but more like everyday people.Their Journey. They debuted from a small and unknown company. They have encountered many hardships throughout their earlier careers because of this very reason. (Getting told they wouldn\u2019t succeed, being cut out of shows bc they weren\u2019t popular enough, all sleeping in the one tiny room, not having the budgets for Music videos and promotional activities) Many of the popular KPOP groups come from the big 3 companies, (YG, SM and JYP) and debut with an already large following, and all the resources needed to gain fame. The fact that they worked their way to the top from humble beginnings, makes fans feel a sense of pride in their achievements.Their bond as a group; Family. All of the members are so genuinely close with one another, having lived with each other for more than 5 years. (Some other groups have members living elsewhere) There are many other Kpop groups where members don\u2019t really get along (Esp with larger groups where I think personalities can inevitably clash) Each member has such a distinctive personality but it somehow works perfectly. Watching videos of them, you can really see the familial bond (Eg. Jin saying he gets nervous when he isnt around his members. Eg. Yoongi saying he wishes they\u2019d remain close until they\u2019re old. Eg. Taehyung saying that sometimes when they don\u2019t see eachother for a few days, they miss the others)I think these are probably the main points. Feel free to add anything if I\u2019ve missed it. This is also what really annoys me when people dismiss BTS as being \u2018a manufactured boyband who sing rlly upbeat songs with no substance and have an annoying fanbase\u2019 because, there\u2019s so much more to them than what people perceive.

            "answer_text": "I think every group is different to one another, every group have their friendships and music and so. what\u2019s make them different is a lot of small things. Remember that I do not know all kpop groups. They have gone through a lot together and that\u2019s why they are so close. Don\u2019t understand me wring, almost every group are close and the members are their closest friends. But BTS have gone through a lot since an early age and thought of quitting sometimes, but it was the members who held them back. I am not saying they are the group who are closest to one another but probably among them, of the groups I love they have the closest friendships.They were early with having meaningful lyrics. It\u2019s becoming more popular to sing about meaningful things but BTS\u2019s debut song was not about girls or love and that was in 2013 when I feel like it wasn\u2019t that common. They have love songs but almost all of them can be about friendship or even yourself.Even their albums seem meaningful. Their names of their albums, The most beautiful moment in life triology, Love yourself triology and now Map of the soul. Most groups don\u2019t think that much about how the name of their album can have an influence. Most albums are called similar to their title track and even though groups like Stray kids have albums like I am not, I am who and I am you, which is about finding who you are, it still feels like BTS put more effort into it. Their latest album is also about finding who you are and they named it Map of the soul. When no one thought it could be more meaningful than Love yourself they somehow did.They are open about insecurities and everything. Some people might find it annoying and I know people who doesn\u2019t listen to BTS because they think BTS are too much about being deep and depressed, but that\u2019s why I love them. Them saying that they have insecurities makes me feel like nobody is perfect, they are people with so much pressure. They make me realize the value of hard work, passion and so much more that I needed when I first listened to them.Bts are more than music. Some people can probably listen to them and thinking they have good songs. I, on the other hand, can always hear their emotions and their meanings. They have helped me and so many others to overcome depression and anxiety, it\u2019s not 100% them but they help us in the beginning or in the middle or to keep us from going back. I don\u2019t know about other groups, I think a lot of Stray kids fans feel so about skz too, but I know everytime you hear ARMYS talk about BTS they always mentions how much help they have been in their daily life.They are producing and writing their own songs. Not 100%, but they are always apart of the process, sometimes they are only helping a little bit and sometimes it\u2019s mostly them (idk if they have a song where it\u2019s 100% them) which means they will never sing a song about something they don\u2019t agree with/want to.It\u2019s a lot of small factors that makes them different. Remember! This does not mean other groups or artist are not as talented/good or that BTS is superior or that all other kpop groups are basically the same, everyone is different but BTS were early in being different in some things (I might be wrong about this but all meaningful songs I\u2019ve listened to is much more new).

            "answer_text": "They are real, that\u2019s what makes them different. I\u2019ve never seen celebrities that I could actually relate to on a personal level. And the funny thing is, is that they don\u2019t seem like celebrities because they don\u2019t act like celebrities. They are just people who so happened to accomplish their dreams. That\u2019s why they can proudly say they\u2019d marry a normal girl, because of how humble and how real they are. I\u2019ve never seen a celebrity cry because they thought they weren\u2019t good enough. When I saw Jimin cry, it broke my heart because it saddens me how hard he pushes himself. And it angers me how people can say he\u2019s self absorbed. I\u2019ve never heard a scandal from them, I\u2019ve never seen anything that\u2019d make me turn the other way. Their music is so inspiring and helpful to people in so many ways, their songs are like a therapy session. It\u2019s funny because they just tell you that it\u2019s alright and you\u2019re never alone in this world. They tell you that it\u2019s not wise to run from your past, instead you should keep it with you and learn from it. I respect them so much because of how helpful and how loving they are, it\u2019s almost like you can feel the love they put into their songs. I\u2019ve never seen any celebrity cry on stage about how they love their fans so much and thank them because they wouldn\u2019t be there without us. Boys who have come from shitty backgrounds; from a poor company; from other idols talking shit about them because of their circumstances, they were able to make it to the top. Even now people still slander them, but they use that slander and turn it into something good. Raw talent is what I see, there\u2019s nothing fake about their personality at all. You see their dance practices and how they sing offstage, it\u2019s the same as if it were a music video. The way they act on their videos, it\u2019s the same people. People who used to work with them said they act the same way they act in their videos, nothing fake about them. Apart from inspiring people with their music, they also make a difference outside the studio. They donated 100 million won to the 4/16 Sewol Families for Truth and A Safer Society which was connected to the Ferry incident a few years ago. That donation was actually made in secret, but someone found out about it. I hate when celebrities make donations and brag about what they did. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t do it for the cause, they only did it for publicity. BTS actually made a secret donation. Their message is Love Yourself because if you can\u2019t love yourself, how can you love others? You have to take care of yourself and fight your battles, so you can learn from that experience and help someone else fight theirs. I could go on and on and on, but BTS is different because they are genuinely good boys. Fighting! ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, so, saying this I may come off biased. And honestly, that\u2019s okay! I don\u2019t expect people who don\u2019t stan BTS (although I definitely think they should) to think of them in the same way I do. But anyway. They don\u2019t look the part- BTS came from a tiny little company, BigHit entertainment. A company which had previously been involved in a terrible, terrible scandal with their girl group GLAM (read here for some information about that whole fiasco- GLAM's Dahee and model Lee Ji Yeon sentenced to one year in prison for attempting to blackmail Lee Byung Hun). But anyway, when they formed the group (around RM, previously Rap Monster, or Kim Namjoon), they didn\u2019t look for visuals. In k-pop, the way they look is very important, almost as important as the music itself. But BigHit didn\u2019t care about that. They looked for talent, finding it in six of the members. (Though I do want to add this: Korean beauty standards, even for men, are incredibly, incredibly strict. I, for one, find Bangtan to be some of the most physically attractive men in the world, but they weren\u2019t seen like that in Korea.) Jin (Kim Seokjin, 25), was recruited for his looks, however (and he was street scouted by SM Entertainment, too! He just thought it was a scam and didn\u2019t go). And guess what\u2026 he couldn\u2019t sing a note! And that brings me onto his second point.Their hardwork- Jin trained and trained and trained. He couldn\u2019t sing, he couldn\u2019t dance, Hoseok (J-Hope, 24) was a rapper and he didn\u2019t know how to rap or produce music, RM and Suga (Min Yoongi, 25) couldn\u2019t dance either. They would work for hours and hours and ours. Hell, at age 14 Jungkook was sent to America for an entire year to learn how to dance. That\u2019s not to say all trainees don\u2019t work hard, they do, but BTS and their hardships are worth mentioning.Their concepts- it\u2019s beautiful. When I first listened to their songs, I watched the MV for Blood, Sweat and Tears, the title track of their Wings album of 2016. Everything, every single thing is gorgeous, their looks, their vocals, the set, the aesthetic, the choreography, the music itself, the lyrics. And don\u2019t get me started on the fan theories. Sure, they may read a little far in, yet little hints and suggestions, like the many paintings and references scattered throughout are amazing, as well as the much more blatant things, like Taehyung being the devil.Their lyrics- I am not Korean, nor do I speak the language. But even just reading the lyrics truly, truly astounds you.\"Dreams disappeared, There was no time to rest It\u2019s a cycle of school, Home or an Internet cafe Everyone lives the same life Students who are pressured to be number One live in between dreams and reality.\" \"Everybody say NO! It can\u2019t be any later Don\u2019t be trapped in someone else\u2019s dream.\" -those lyrics are from their song NO, title track of O!RUL82?, which focuses on the pressures of being a kid. Then there\u2019s lyrics like these from Butterfly, which are simply beautiful, to me anyway. \"You're just like a butterfly,From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect,Your light touches, I forget the reality at once.\" And inspirational lyrics about self love. \"Yeah I hate youAlthough you leftThere hasn't been a day that I have forgotten youHonestly, I miss youBut now I'll erase youBecause that will hurt less than resenting you\" -Spring Day. That\u2019s certainly not all, honestly. I could go into depth about personality, struggles with mental illness, lack of support from their family, but that\u2019ll take hours to read and hours to write. ",

            "answer_text": " As I mentioned in Why is BTS suddenly so popular? I\u2019m not into Kpop before I heard of BTS but you know how once you view something on YouTube, the algorithms would start suggesting Kpop related content? Suddenly I was thrust into a world of Kpop including the darker side of how labels take the phones away from their trainees, enforced a dating ban, make sure their trainees are no more than 100 lbs no matter their height, control their diet, limit their artistic freedom, make them get plastic surgery, don\u2019t allow them to express themselves on social media and overwork them till they faint from exhaustion. BTS can eat whatever they want. V and his hamburgers. Jin with his recipes and Eat Jin vlogs and the whole gang with mukbangs. I read horror stories where other companies' trainees were forced to go on diets, which almost feel like abuse, but these boys are happily enjoying their food. I read accounts where even passionate dancers lost their enthusiasm because they can\u2019t be themselves, but BTS was free to be themselves. Jimin starved himself based on his own account, not by company orders.  I noticed a lot of other Kpop trainees are also very good looking, hardworking, disciplined, and talented. Some of these other groups have more fluent English speakers too. Comparable or even surpassing BTS, and with even more resources from bigger entertainment companies to go big, so I was curious why they didn\u2019t flourish. I mean all the band members of EXO (especially Kris Wu & Kai), Taemin/SHINee, Got7 (especially Jackson) do not lose out in looks, talent, charisma, etc in anyway at all. I noticed they have an edge to them, alittle bit of danger, darker, savage and a delicious bad boy vibe compared to BTS. In real life, those are more my type of people I get along with. BTS definitely have a more innocent, safer, harmless, clean-cut vibe compared to them. I guess coming from a smaller company, they developed that killer instinct that you need to have in order to reach the top of a survival environment of bigger, draconian company. I mean Jackson Wang and Kris Wu speak Chinese and English frequently- I would\u2019ve thought they\u2019ll be able to penetrate two of the biggest markets English and Chinese speaking effortlessly. Kris Wu left EXO and SHINee has a band member committed suicide. Maybe the group bond and management just isn\u2019t as good as BTS. When j-Hope tried to leave BTS, JK cried and RM went through great lengths to get him back. Their bond is special and endearing, which is what warms our hearts. All 7 band members was there from the beginning and have stayed till now. The other Kpop members don\u2019t have the same bond.   The other Kpop idols feel more vampirish, serious, intense, smooth and sexual. BTS feels a lot cuter, lighter, more wholesome, a little awkward, and more fun.  In other words BTS feels very real with a non-threatening attractiveness about them and like anyone can see themselves hanging out with the boys, therefore BTS appeal to a much wider audience. They have this cute boyish charm, baby mochi faces while the other top Kpop groups I mentioned above do not have these baby faces. Their bone structure is stronger.  The main reason was the sincerity and the freedom to use of digital media to promote traditional old school products of physical albums and live performances. Bang PD didn\u2019t control BTS the way other management companies controlled their artists. He empowered them and gave them space to be themselves. I was searching for hints that BTS went through the dark sides of what I mentioned above but couldn\u2019t find any. Their phones weren\u2019t taken away from them. They could produce solos, mixtapes and was not forced to go through plastic surgery. It is this sharing of their lifestyles and realness that connected outside of work that built one of the world\u2019s most powerful global fandom now known as army. I can\u2019t get enough of BTS outside of their work. I keep binge-watching their travel vlogs, reality shows, BTS Run, interviews, TikTok videos, V Lives, etc. Their personalities are all very engaging even off stage, but for the other Kpop groups, while they are super talented like Taemin and Kai on stage, and I can\u2019t get enough of their dances and singing, I couldn\u2019t finish any media coverage of theirs off stage. I lost interest in their personal lives. For BTS, I went to download their mobile game even though I don\u2019t really play games but I loved knowing the backstory of BTS. ",

            "answer_text": "There are ro many things that BTS have that othee groups don\u2019t. Though I will just say the most obvious ones. They make their own songs. Well there are other grps that make their own too but majority of the popular idols dont. For example, blackpink they are globally famous too but they dont make their own songs too. Exo too is famous in korea but SM doesnt really give them that much freedom (sadt). So tye factor that they MAKE their own song plus their agency gives them freedom is a really great COMBO.BTS just focused on what they do best. They\u2019ve become globally famous just by being themselves thats why ppl love them. They didnt targetted the west. It just happened. So just by doing their thing, theyve achieved so much.They got a really strong bond. Even before, Bang si hyuk always let them to talk about their feelings and sentiments about each other. Maybe the reason why they work better, cause they gkt good relations w each other making them efficient and productive at the same time.Their rap is really nice and has the bait in it. Also the message that those deliver is really different from other rap verses.Bts is really hardworking and down to earth. They attend every award shows they can go to. Im talking about their 2013\u20132015 days. They are not afraid to go to MAMA and not get any award. Thats in 2014 if I can remember. They just really want to perform. Thats passion and hardwork at the same time. They even performed at the red carpet. Some grps from bigger agency wont do it cause for some it\u2019s iust for low rising stars. And they performed at a fashion show too sometime in 2015. Other grps from big agencies wont need to do that cause they got budget. BTS IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ANY CHANCE THAT WOULD BOOST THEM.They interact with fans before through Bangtan bomb, now they got diff videos and variety too. They are not scared to show the real them.THere is so much to say but I guess this is the most important ones. ",

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t :D They did start out differently tho. Big Hit wanted a hip-hop group and went out to recruit real street hip-hop artists (very young ones of course). RM & Suga (rappers) & J-Hope (street dancer extraordinaire) are NOT your typical KPop idols. Their big claim to uniqueness is that they have input into their concepts, & write much of their music (at least collaborate) - that\u2019s due to the vision of Big Hit\u2019s CEO Bang Si Hyuk, a song lyricist himself. It\u2019s a small company as well.This group not only writes their stuff but works on production as well, hand in hand w/the Big Hit producer/CEO. This has impressed Westerners. However, Big Bang led the way there. They set the goalpost. GDragon has written more songs than any other KPop idol. SHINee also had a great songwriter/lyricist among them (JongHyun, RIP) who wrote songs for his group from the start (Juliette, for instance). The fact that SM (evil incarnate LOL) didn\u2019t let SHINee perform all his songs made him sad. SK entertainment companies are VERY adaptive. They made note of how successful BTS has been in opening up the US market, and how the fact the group is involved in the creative process, and all of a sudden many of the baby groups also do this. There are new groups following this example - most notably Stray Kids, who write all their own music AND choreography, but also Astro & Pentagon.BTS are insanely hard-working, talented and creative. But bad news for US entertainment and recording industries - they aren\u2019t ALONE!!!! There are many more KPop groups out there capable of setting teen girls\u2019 hearts afire LOL ",

            "answer_text": "This is the easiest question I ever encountered in Quora. 1.BTS got Namjoon  Kim Namjoon is a great and a responsible leader. Other groups don\u2019t have him that is why BTS is a lot different compare to other groups / Kpop Groups. BTS have the best main rapper and an intelligent leader Kim Namjoon who is fluent in english and is one of the smartest Koreans. Does any other group have a Kim Namjoon? 2. BTS got Jin  BTS is a funny group because they got Jin to give them dad jokes. Although those were corny, yet are funny. BTS is the only group that has a member who is this confident and handsome making Jin the best visual a group could ever have.He is the WORLDWIDE HANDSOME you know. Ohh! He can also reach the highest building with his high notes.Lypsinc isn\u2019t in his vocabulary. 3.BTS got Suga  I could say that BTS is unique because of Suga. He can directly say everything to their antis. Not a question, because he is so SAVAGE. With his rap, antis will rather choose to stay away from bashing BTS or else they\u2019ll die through Suga\u2019s sharp-as-knife rap. 4. BTS got Jhope  Jhope gives the light for his group through his shining smile.He is like a sun that when you look at him, you\u2019ll automatically smile and fade your sadness away so BTS is really different. He is a lead rapper but could be a vocalist. Dancing machine of the group? Jhope. 5. BTS got Jimin  BTS is the only group who got Lachimolala. In each of his performance, he leave everyone \u2018wowed\u2019. He could be hot onstage but he will bring everyone to heaven with his angelic voice. Only BTS got a Jimin. 6. BTS got V  It is undeniable that he is very charismatic that many adore him. His 4D personality will surely capture your heart plus his popular boxy smile that could also be heart-shaped. Call him Taehyung and he will talk to you seriously, call him V and you will like him more. Even if he isn\u2019t the official visual, his handsome face is enough to prove that he is with Jin as the world wide handsome. 7. BTS got Jungkook  Jungkook is one of the most precious persons in the earth. He ain\u2019t called the Golden Maknae for nothing. Jungkook can do majority of his wants. Mutitalented he is.He is the youngest yes, but he really is something that other Kpop groups don\u2019t have. He could be the main rapper, lead rapper, or a dancing machine with a golden voice inside. He looks cute but he is actually sexy. Words can\u2019t describe him unless you stan him. BTS is different because BTS is BTS. ",

            "answer_text": "There would be no one against the fact that now is the prime time of BTS. Let\u2019s talk about what made BTS outstanding so far. BTS is turning into world star as spending 6 months in a year touring abroad and the only continent they have never conquered is Africa. Now, they became not only Korean celebrities, while receiving tremendous amount of interest all around the world. As you know already, BTS won the prize at billboard music awards on May 21 as the first winner that takes place of Justin Bieber. For that fact, they got attention internationally. Then, what makes BTS so different from other groups in Korea? 1. Target American market  First thing first, very different form other K-Pop idols who mainly target SE Asia or Chinese fans, BTS targeted American market directly. Because the half of members are rappers and hip-hop genre is more popular in US than any other countries. 2. Every member is talented  All BTS members are very talented. For example, Rap Monster is good rapper, composer, and also lyricist. Also, Suga and J-Hope started to rap and produce songs since they were teenager. This means that BTS can make their songs and many other things on their own without any help from others. 3. Great synergy effect  Strong synergy effect BTS creates is the most important reason why they got so popular. Members who mainly rap are teaching vocalist members how to sing and vice versa. All the parts of composing and producing music are being distributed to all of members and it creates a huge synergy effect. 4. High quality of music  However, eventually, the final point where fans are crazy about is their music. BTS\u2019s songs range from catchy EDM, hip-hop, trendy pop, rocking dance and various genre. For these reasons, All of their songs are very easy to grab attentions. Additionally, their perfect choreography is the best. 5. Story connoted in music  Songs such as \u2018SPINE BREAKER\u2018 and \u2018DOPE\u2018 including social message based on real problems in Korean society get interests from not only Korean fans but also foreign fans around the world. From foreign fans, they received lots of questions about the reason why they write lyrics about deep social things rather than things related to love, party, and beauty like other idol groups. Likewise, BTS always has been earnest and serious about their music.  Source: 5 5 Reasons Why BTS Is Different From Other K-Pop Idols ",

            "answer_text": "Well to some people it's the music itself, and to others it's the message. BTS has always been about you bettering you. You loving you. BTS has spoken on this many times and if you find the lyrics for the songs you can see for yourself. They make music for Army and the world, they don't make music because they want money or fame or possessions. Those things are arbitrary, just a bonus. They want to spread the message of love. Not only to love what's around you and who's around you, but to look inward and to love yourself for who you are. To stand up as your own person, loving exactly who you are, and follow your dreams. This is something they've demonstrated time and time again since their debut in 2013. The song No More Dream from their album 2 Cool 4 Skool, speaks on how the youth shouldn't just go to school and get a boring job just because they or their parents want them to have an income, but rather that they should follow their dreams and reach big. In his solo song, Epiphany, in the album Love Yourself: Answer, Jin sings the line \u201cI'm the one I should love, in this world\u201d more than once as he talks about finding himself and realizing that he's not perfect but he's still beautiful and he's the one he should loving. It's a concept they\u2019re still bringing forth to this day as you can see in their song Mikrokosmos. They sing about being stars in the night sky and how the only reason the night is so beautiful is because of the stars. Basically, people love BTS because BTS loves people. They love their fans over everything. And they love themselves. That's some for kids and teens and even adults to look up to. An example to follow. ",

A fandom who supports BTS and cheers them on even on tough days. A fandom who\u2019s understanding, respectful, supportive and loving. A fandom who get\u2019s together and makes these amazing ARMY projects. A fandom who will always stay together as a family, and together we\u2019ll stay \u2018Bulletproof\u2019. BTS is different because other groups don\u2019t have the same Kim Namjoon, Kim Seokjin, Min Yoongi, Jung Hoseok, Park Jimin, Kim Taehyung, Jeon Jungkook and ARMY. BTS will always be different and other groups will also be different. But, what makes BTS really different is that they always remind us that: \u201cWe are not seven, with you.\u201d -We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal. - \ua731\u1d00\u1d0d\u1d0d\u026a\u1d07 \u2665 ",

ARMY\u2019s and BTS are always there for each other and help each other grow.They learn from their mistakes. During their debut days, BTS have done some things that were considered misogynistic, racist etc. But they grew from that, apologized and continued to work hard and make good music.They work their hardest for everything. They are always practicing back to back with workout sessions. They practice for hours and hours just to perfect their choreography.They are very open about their struggles and the challenges they faced. They aren't embarrassed by their pastBTS started off with basically nothing. The company (Bighit) they debuted under was literally broke in the beginning. They also faced lots of hate from people when they first debuted because they were different from the other kpop groups. They had to work hard to get where they are at now.BTS writes a lot of their songs and the upcoming album will be completely self-produced and made by them.BTS uses their platform for good use. They get involved in a lot of non-profit work. For example Their partnership with UNICEF for the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign.They have a diverse community of fans, almost from all over the world.",

            "answer_text": "It is honestly all of opinion. Here is why I love BTS, but I wouldn\u2019t say they are seen as \u201cthe best\u201d by the rest of the world. 1. They talk about real problems, not many people do that mostly cause they haven\u2019t experienced it. 2. They can get me hyped up, emotional, chilled and relaxed. Whenever I am doing homework I can listen to their music. Whenever I am feeling sad, their music is there for me, always. Whenever I want something to listen to while browsing Pinterest, drawing, or studying, I can listen to BTS. 3. I love their personalities and their dances. BTS are honestly very unique and I love them. They all are full of surprises and they light up my day. 4. Their lyrics. Their songs can have so much meaning. There are songs that are so comforting to me and there are songs that talk about what they\u2019ve been through but how they pushed through and became stronger. 5. Their relationship with each other. I am being honest, I have never seen a stronger band of friends. I love seeing friends being sweet with each other and them showing their love for each other. 6. Their fandom. Okay I know this may sound super cliche (it all does Alek T_T) but their fandom is so nice and so supporting. A lot of people are willing to comfort you. I think ARMY and BTS have changed me for the better\u2026 And I think they will even more, I\u2019ve only been in this fandom for a few months, and I\u2019ve seen so much change in myself. I\u2019ve loved myself more, other people more, become more confident and open and I not afraid to defend BTS and ARMY when a hater yeets an insult at me and/or my fandom. We are fans from all over the world here to support each other and our boys <3 We are really a strong family. One of my favorite sayings is; \u201cFamily doesn\u2019t have to be related by blood.\u201d I believe this is so true for ARMY and BTS. BTS love us, with everything they have, and ARMY loves each other. Like Halsey said in an interview; \u201cARMY is viewed by the media as crazy, lovesick fangirls but they are actually really intelligent, kind, caring, and amazing individuals.\u201d and also \u201cThey are protective of BTS but they have a reason to be.\u201d We aren\u2019t just crazy fangirls. We are a family of many different genders, identities, races, backgrounds and we are brought together by 7 wonderful boys who love us more than the world and they taught us so well. 7. Their response to haters. They. shut. them. down. 8. BTS humbleness. Okay, starting off with a small thing. Jungkook (the youngest member) joined BTS when he was 14. Fame at a young age can have a negative impact on a child, but he has remained humble. Adding onto this, BTS are multimillionaires, they make a lot of money but they get so excited over a $5 coupon to a fast food place. One of the members (Suga) got so excited when he learned that the prize for a game was a whole comic book collection. This man could get it within 3 clicks of a button but he didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know why, but they are so humble. They even give back by donating to charities. 9. Their fansigns. They love us so much, dude. They get so happy when they get to meet their fans and talk with us. At the Grammy\u2019s, an interviewers asked what they were going to do after the Grammy\u2019s, and they said talk to us on VLive. Excuse me while I cry of cuteness. 10. Lastly; Their love for us. BTS. LOVES. US. SO. FRICKITY. FRACKING. MUCH. OH. MY. GOSH. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, they just love and appreciate us so much ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's the fact that BTS seems to be working more WITH their company while other groups seem to be working strictly FOR their company. Due to their close connection and relationship that they have built with bighit, BTS have much more freedom in terms of the music they make in all its aspects. Other groups that do produce music are usually tied down to a concept that their company sets out for them (with a few exceptions of course.) while Bighit seems to build its concepts around the songs that BTS make. They have so much creative control and the freedom to make whatever they want. I think the main difference between other Idols and BTS is that they're allowed to be raw and personal with their music while a lot of groups don't get that privilege. I don't think any other group would have been able to make something as artistic as Black Swan was, not because they don't have the talent (don't get me wrong the Kpop industry is filled with gems left and right) but they simply don't have creative input. Companies usually don't allow the idols to share their struggles and be personal because of the whole idol culture being based on perfection and idols being superior (sucks to admit) while BTS were much more relatable with their approach which is what I believe to be the reason behind their success.

I can't say much on this because I'm not ARMY but the relationship they maintain with their fans is remarkable. their underdog story. people love to reassure themselves that no matter how hard challenges are hard work always prevails. BTS gives them that hope. the Bangtan Universe. no act has done storytelling as deep, complex, consistent, and with such attention to detail as bts. BU is too big to be told into MVs alone that\u2019s why it has expanded into cross-platform storytelling like books, short films, games, even has a real flower shop, even an upcoming drama. they are revolutionizing multi-medium storytelling. their work often includes references to works of art and literature with themes of psychology, Greek mythology, philosophy, and even politics. and lastly, their mission. BTS\u2019s Korean name is \u2018Bangtan Sonyeondan\u2019 which directly translates to \u2018Bulletproof Scouts\u2019. Though from a direct translation it is hard to understand its meaning, figuratively it means \u201cto block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets.\u201d they have reflected this through every one of their songs. A lot of groups make great music but the ones that transcend time periods provide people with so much more than entertainment, they provide tools to navigate your way through life and manifest a good one. and that is what bts is doing. did I say short? haha sorry about that. once I started, so many things came to mind and I had to write them down. peace ~Ash ",

            "answer_text": "For me, the most special is the way BTS treat each other. For humans, it is normal and good to compete for a greater success. But the form, the style, the manner of competition - that\u2019s what makes the difference. I will never forget Simon Cowell words to the American Idol singers: \u201cYou think, others like you, support you? Ha ha, they hate your guts!\u201d Simon really believes it; in his world, the participants of any competition hate each other and wish each other the worst. I never liked Simon Cowell, but after these words to young singers I disliked him very much. And I do not believe him. BTS guys are normal humans, and yes, they compete with each other and the singers outside of their group. But the way they do it! I admire it. BTS genuinely support each other, they are genuinely happy with each one success, and sincerely worry about each other less than perfect performance. Not just worry, they will actively teach each other, spend tons of time and exercise great patience. Why are they that good? I watched tons of BTS stuff (lots of it is available online for free), trying to understand the team\u2019s dynamics. First I thought that it is all thanks to RM. I still think that RM is vitally important for the team morale, but he is not alone.Then I notice Jimin and his role as \u201cthe heart of BTS\u201d. After I watch the video where BTS told the story of Jimin coming to RM for a serious talk about his leadership style, I decided that it was all Jimin. I still think that Jimin is vitally important for the team morale, but he is not alone.Then I notice Jin \u2026 [Well, Jin became my forever bias, but it is not the point.] I think that Jin is vitally important for the team morale, but he is not alone.Finally, I realized that they all are good people, good to the core. Even the most rebellious and competitive of BTS (Suga and Jungkook) are good and generous in their innermost selves.BTS guys stay gold. I love them. ",

Some people like BTS because they write their own songs/produce them (many groups do this btw\u2026), others like the message they\u2019re trying to give, the storyline, the boys, etc. What drew me in back in 2014\u20132015ish was their concepts, many people find that old Bangtan and their music is cringe-worthy but this was what was popular back then and yet Bangtan was able to bring something new to it. I like/d them because they brought/bring something new to cliche concepts. I will say this, BTS isn\u2019t a 100% what ARMY\u2019s tend to make them seem, they're their fans obviously they see more to them then what others see, what they\u2019re doing has been done before, maybe not like them but it has/is being done, and groups do similar things just like them but BTS was able to grab peoples attention due to always bringing something \u201cnew\u201d within their concepts. TDLR; Most ARMY\u2019s that I\u2019ve met recently (I\u2019m not gonna use ARMY\u2019s that I\u2019ve met back in 2016 and back) say that they like BTS because of the message, music, and style they have.

            "answer_text": "OK SO In the beginning of their career, yes they we\u2019re not your typical boy group. They focused a lot more on hip hop than anyone else at the time and to top it all off, with every song they make at least one member like RM, Suga or J-hope will always have a hand in writing the music which a lot of more popular groups now don\u2019t usually do(but of course groups like i-Kon, got7, etc. still have songs where one of the members have written a song ). BTS has been doing that since the beginning. I\u2019ve noticed more now, though, that due to their overwhelming popularity they\u2019ve lost a lot of their initial hard hitting hip hop flare and are a lot more reminiscent of your average Korean boy group. The songs are a lot more catchy and are less hip hop and more pop. They have become more typical so to speak. Even though BTS is my absolute ultimate favorite group, and I've been following them since early 2015, I can say that they aren\u2019t all that different anymore from any other kpop group at the moment. They give the people what they want! Which truly is smart on their end because it keeps their popularity high and in demand. ",

Yes other groups love their members but BTS\u2019 love for each other is unbreakable and I feel like it\u2019s genuine and heart-felt. The amount of effort they put into everything, it stuns me. Their choreography and how well it\u2019s put together, how advanced it is. Their energy is absolutely something that not all artists have. Their effort to connect with us ARMY, they support many youthful issues such as bullying, they look after us. Their variety of music and the fact that the messages they convey through their music are down to earth and just something that not only our Youth but people older as well can enjoy. Their Genres are a whole range from Ballads, to Rock, Hip-Hop, RnB , they\u2019re truly talented men and I\u2019m glad I stan them. ",

            "answer_text": "To me what makes BTS different are these 3 things: They write and compose their own songs, and usually the lyrics have deep meanings and/or written based of their experiences. Here are some in this link \u2192 Deepest BTS (\ubc29\ub2e8\uc11c\ub144\ub2e8) lyrics \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 | ARMY's AminoThe bond between ARMYs and BTS. I mean its amazing. BTS wrote songs for ARMYs and AMRYs wrote songs to BTS. AMRYs do their best to protect BTS. Like ARMYs holding up a purple ribbon in the airport themselves so BTS had a save path out of the airport. And I see loads of people saying that BTS and Army have a relationship that no other fandom has. I saw someone say something like this \u201cBTS and Army are more than just Idol and fans, we are family.\u201d And it\u2019s true.Their bond as a group. You can tell that BTS are like brothers. You can see how much they love each other (as friends/brothers. Guys don\u2019t get the wrong idea\u2026) Like when I watch fanmade videos, Run BTS or Bangtan bombs I can clearly see how close they are.I hope this helped lol! ",

The members of bts are also very open to fans when it comes to their own issues. They also choreograph, write, produce and sing all of their own acts with little help from others, there are several kpop acts who do this as well but not as many who do all three. And lastly BTS come from a company that was unknown and very low budgeted. Bts was pretty much the last resort for Bighit ent. Due to Bighits first group being a complete flop (one member left, another got into legal issues and went to jail, and bighit was forced to disband.) It was a surprise to many (bts themselves included) when the group almost was even more famous internationally than in south korea. Bts has also performed for the president of South Korea. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I don\u2019t think so, though I am happy for those who think this way. I\u2019m not a huge army anymore but it\u2019d be absurd not to acknowledge that BTS has greatly pushed the Korean wave forward in the west. At the moment many outsiders or new fans think of them as \u2018the face of kpop\u2019. I greatly disagree but that\u2019s beside the point. Since the newer kpop fans that are flocking in this year have only heard how special bts is- why would they listen to other artists when they\u2019ve been told bts is so different from the rest? So of course bts would be considered special, what is there to compare them to! Many fans have said bts stands out because... They self-produce! This is great, but we could acknowledge that many other groups also self-produce. Such as stray kids, highlight, EXID, wonder girls, pentagon, g-idle, got7, cnblue, ect..They are hilarious! Humor is subjective but of course there are at least a few other groups that could make you laugh. Maybe watch some videos of got7, exo, pentagon, target, myteen, highlight, khan, ect.. as they are very funny.They are very sweet guys! Again, many other groups have proven themselves to be kind. Like ACE, myteen, the ark, pentagon, ect..They sing about important issues! Yes I love them for that and I agree its become rare to see groups talk about important issue but that doesn\u2019t mean bts are the only one. Mamamoo sings about how their weight wont determine their value in \u2018yes I am\u2019 and 3racha literally brought up suicide rates in \u2018+-\u2019, made a whole song on global warming (\u201cdomestic banana\u201d), and there are at least 4 songs about the extreme focus east Asian countries put on academics.They have a good rapline! You could check out 3racha, yong junhyung, e\u2019dawn, jeon soyeon, or king G-Dragon.Visuals! It\u2019s pretty much a requirement to be attractive to become an idol. Look at eunsu from myteen\u2026 whatta guy.Bts has much going for them and i\u2019m glad they\u2019ve done so much for kpop but anything you find in one kpop group you will be able to find in another. I absolutely love a group called highlight, mainly for their live vocals and the fact they self produce. I think they are different from some idols in that respect, however they are not any different from a group called pentagon that also self-produce and sings well live. So it\u2019s a matter of what groups you compare bts to that will either make you think \u201cThey are different from any other group!!\u201d or \u201cThey are a special group for me because I know they are talented! However, they are similar to this other group in terms of what makes the two stand out.\u201d It\u2019s just a matter of rationalizing so don\u2019t attack me :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's their lyrics . They also have a very unique storyline . Unlike majority of the other groups , their message and lyrics to the listeners are very inspiring and thoughtful . They use genius allegory in their music videos . Other than these things their choreography and music can really move people hearts but can also make you dance . It's like a whole lot of styles starting from hip-hop to the most beautiful melodious song . It should be noted that out of the seven members 2 used to be underground rappers and had been making music even before their debut . Also other two has experience in dance , one of them was a locally known street dancer and the other is a top student in contemporary dance in his arts school . And also nearly all of them can produce their own music. So in conclusion this is what makes them different from other groups and artists but that doesn't make the other artists any less greater . ",

            "answer_text": "I am an ARMY myself since 2015 so I am very proud how far BTS have come in their careers. What I believe is very different from BTS that makes them more special than other groups is that they have a heartwarming message in their music and they taught us persistence. Of course, everyone probably knows about the message in the eras like Love Yourself and others but I want to focus more on the earlier eras and some background about them. BTS debuted in 2013 from Big Hit Entertainment, a small company which has not been recognised, and they were set to be just a game and a tryout group instead of an actual big deal and they were actually going to debut as a successful group. In the earlier eras, they differed their music from time to time from We Are Bulletproof Pt2 to songs like Butterfly. They might sound like completely normal songs and they were very hype to listen to, but really the message behind them always touch people in a lot of different ways. For example, in the song Butterfly, the lyrics read \u201c\uc190 \ub300\uba74 \ub0a0\uc544\uac08\uae4c \ubd80\uc11c\uc9c8\uae4c, \uac81\ub098 \uac81\ub098 \uac81\ub098\u201d. (If I let go of your hand, you\u2019ll fly away and break,I\u2019m scared scared scared of that). This part of the lyrics implies to a deeper meaning of friendship and love, it talks about people who are looking for someone they can trust, someone they can love and not lose them simply. This is just one example, but all of BTS songs has a deeper meaning in it and they will always touch you despite if it\u2019s a sad memory or a happy memory. As I have mentioned before, BTS came from Big Hit which was a small company at that time. They were not told to be successful and treated as some of a joke. In the earlier eras, they have mentioned that performing in front of 100\u2013200 was already beyond their dreams. In these 7 years, they aren\u2019t just doing that, they are performing in front of millions of people sharing their music. In multiple times, they have thought of quitting when times are hard, but what did they do? They continued, they persisted and they didn\u2019t give up. Since I have followed them for 5 years, it is very surprising to see that a lot of people are touched by their messages and people are starting to realise their talent and telling their story. Before you come at me and say other groups have these, I just want to say, NOT ALL HAVE THESE. A lot of big groups like TWICE, BLACKPINK, EXO all came from the big companies and they are treated like a real group since the very beginning of their careers. However, BTS didn\u2019t, they had to fight their way onto the top, fighting off all the haters who believe they are just useless and untalented people. I\u2019m not implying that groups like TWICE and BLACKPINK aren\u2019t good groups though since they are amazing, however, I\u2019m just stating the fact that they needed to climb their way without loosing hope for 7 WHOLE YEARS really gets me emotional seeing how far they come. Thank you for reading, I hope you have a great day. I might come back to add more information and edit it a bit but thank you :) ",

Many groups write their own music but BTS have a way of writing that is vulnerable, personal, and relatable. They have a genuine bond that they can easily share with the world. I dont feel like the company gave them personas to play out, I think they just are who they are. Again, other groups have fantastic bonds but it isn't translated or communicated as effectively or effortlessly. They broke the kpop mold and challenged the existing paradigm by creating a successful career despite the odds being stacked against them. Before BTS, it was Big3 ft. A couple other companies but now groups from smaller companies feel encouraged to really strive for success. ",

To answer your question, BTS is great because they\u2019re not a typical kpop group. Their style of music is very unique. Each rapper has a style, and each singer complements the rappers beautifully. their message is always deep and meaningful because the members are active in the writing and productions of their songs. Personally, I don\u2019t really like the feel of their more recent albums. I feel like they shied away from their hip-hop style and put too much strain on the singers to do a pop style because they came to America. it\u2019s not who they are. I recommend all albums up to wings if you like a hip-hop feel. ",

            "answer_text": "Their innocence , honestly and vulnerability even when the world is against them is what truly sets them apart from other artist. They are a gem one of its kind and very rare to find in this world. They are exceedingly genuine people and you can see it in their face and behavior. To be fair, there are other groups that is equally good or way better in some aspects then BTS (vocals/songwriting/dance/etc) but what they dont have is the deep bonding of brotherhood, the love and care for each other and the vulnerability, humbleness as real as you can get. I truly believe that as human, we want to believe in goodness-no matter how bad a person we are, there is a small part deep inside of us, we sometimes wish that we can be a better person - and that is what BTS represents.

All of them are handsome, cute, awesome, amazing and PERFECT. Not to mention they blesses our soul with their beautiful visuals and angelic voices but that even leads us to mental break down. They are the reason of many people\u2019s happiness including me. They have a great impact on many people\u2019s life including mine. In conclusion, they are all different and unique in their own way, all of them are talented and PERFECT. Its just my opinion so I don\u2019t know if it was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "All that i say down below is my personal opinion. I'm not saying that another group hasnt worked as hard as BTS or anything I'm just taking them how I view them. BTS was my first K-pop group I listened to and instantly stanned. It was completely new to me, but my first video was \u201cBoy in Luv\u201d and I was like wow, this is catchy, they're all attractive men and their vocals and flow of rapping went well, and my growing interest went on from there. Then, I realized the hard work they put into who they are. They didnt come from the main 3 companies(YG, JYP, and SM) so it was harder for them to gain popularity. They had to go through so many things to be able to get out there, and almost lost the band themselves during N.O era which was heartbreaking to find out. But, fortunately they pulled through and showed the world how passionate and hardworking yet caring, selfless, and humble young men they were. They dedicated their lives to this work. Even if they have little personal dreams(like Hobi wanting to debut as a singer) they pushed them away for what was good for the group itself. Growing up in America, you dont see that utter kindness around a lot, and I think that's another reason why I have a deep love for these boys. They really deserve the world and all the awards and publicity theyve been given these past 2ish years. Again this is just my personal opinion. I'm not saying groups like EXO or GOT7 from the big 3 dont work hard for what they have because they do, I'm just telling my outlook on just BTS. \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 ",

I mean if you like music and especially R&B and EDM and pop so BTS is perfect preference and even if you are not into these genres , then too you will like their music. Also if we look on the message they give through their songs and music and the way they inspires people it's just , amaazzzzziiinnngggg!!!! I am an ARMY and I am not just saying this because of I am one of Army, the way they deal with the problems faced by people , teenagers & young people in their songs Do reflects the problems faced by all people , it really does and it shows that they have gone through it too and they are trying to help others out of it now . They are just amazing!!! ",
