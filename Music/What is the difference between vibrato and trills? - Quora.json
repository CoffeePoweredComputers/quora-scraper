            "answer_text": "Whether in vocal or instrumental technique, the distinction that I perceive is in the degree of pitch variation. Vibrato generally suggests a narrower range of fluctuation from the pitch being sung or played at a given moment. Of course, certain types of singing such as opera tend to feature a dramatic vibrato applied to the central pitch but not necessarily a wide deviation from that pitch. Trills, on the other hand, indicate a clear change from one discrete pitch to another and in the practice of western art music, at least, this would mean a deviation of at least a semi-tone and therefore a much greater pitch variation than any vibrato. In vocal application, the swing between the two discrete pitches is quite fluid (like a rapid sliding). In my experience, both trills and vibrato are produced by the vocal folds, not the lips or tongue, in spite of the existence of vocal exercises for the lips or tongue that might be labelled \u201ctrills\u201d. This example from Bach\u2019s St. John Passion, \u201cEs ist vollbracht\u201d, shows both the application of vibrato on single pitches and various ornaments such as trills where the pitch distinctly changes; the score in the video can help to point out the latter.

            "answer_text": "Vibrato: A slight oscillation of pitch where there is the perception of a single pitch. Ideally it should be in the \u201ccenter\u201d of the oscillation frequencies. In music post 1900, it\u2019s a somewhat pervasive feature of most concert voices and instruments. Pre 1900 it was not used as much; rather more as an ornament or effect. Trill: an alternation of two adjacent pitches. Post 1800, it tends to be a rapidly executed ornament or decoration of a long note . Generally, pre-1800, it should always start on the upper (non harmonic) note; it tends to be relatively slow - depending on tempo - to highlight the non-harmonic upper note at the cadence, or wherever it occurs. See the wikipedia articles on vibrato and trill for more info. ",
