            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a classical musician and no expert on the popular music business, but I\u2019ll try to give some ideas since I was asked. In a nutshell, in no specific order: Initial fan base, often built by performingOnline presenceNetworkingTrainingA job to get income. When you are starting out you will need to invest and you will have more costs than you make from gigsIf you want to get known more than just locally in the area where you live, you need online presence. Many bands start out by building the initial loyal fan base by doing lots or gigs. When you have material online, they can start spreading the word by sharing it to their connections. In the beginning you can try to build your fan base with live gigs, social media presence, and publishing recordings made by yourself. You can get started in the social media that is free or has very reasonable costs (like Facebook ads), but at some point you will need other professionals to help you. Solo gigs are of course easy to do, but to make the songs sound more complete you will probably need more instruments (unless it\u2019s all electronic) for your recordings, maybe also for gigs. Try to network with other musicians in your area, see if there is an open jam or something. Social media groups are one way to reach like-minded people. The little bit of luck that can make the difference is often that the right person hears your music, likes it and wants to help or work with you. It would be great if you found some producer that would be interested in your material and working with you and help with the recording process. Or found a more well-known band who likes your material that could take you to their tours as an opening act. It\u2019s good to have some kind of a day job to support yourself. When you want to take your artistry to a more professional level, that creates some costs that probably aren\u2019t covered by doing gigs. For example professional studio recordings, promotional materials like professional photos, and a proper web site. Touring can easily cost more than you get from the gigs, especially if you have other musicians performing with you. When you have a professional quality recordings of some songs, then seek advice about how to spread/distribute it to get it played on the radio or get some record label interested (I have no clue really about that process). I think it\u2019s good that you find you could benefit from training. Find out if there are educational programs you could apply to, or just take private lessons for those areas you feel need to be worked on. A good teacher can make a different in your singing and playing, and an outside perspective could help you with songwriting skills too. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first of all, you have to actually possess the talent to sing. You can\u2019t just wake up one day and decide you want to be a singer, BUT\u2026 If you already possess the talent, you can\u2026 Practice daily. Find your vocal range, and try all types of genres of music to sing, until you find one that locks you in.Make every song your own, do NOT sing any song like the actual artist does. For instance\u2026 If you like the song \u201cHello\u201d by Adele, do NOT mimic the way she sings it when you sing it. Put your own tone of voice to it.Practice your writing daily. When you get Writer\u2019s Block, do not force yourself to write something, or you\u2019re gonna end up writing the wrong song. Think and brainstorm about something in your life that you know you could possibly write into a hit song.Make everything unique. From the lyrics, to the story the lyrics tell, to the background music (I\u2019m assuming you know you can make your own background music and or use copyright free music)Make sure that nobody else has written the same song as you, because yes, people do sometimes mistakenly, unintentionally write the same song as someone else, then have to go back and reedit the song.Take vocal coaching, no matter HOW talented you are or how talented you THINK you are, it seriously will get your voice into the right tone. There is Alto, Soprano, Second Soprano, Contralto for women. For men, it\u2019s Tenor, Bass, Soprano, Alto. There are others, I just can\u2019t think of them at the moment.Source: I\u2019m an aspiring self-made musician with a SoundCloud page, lyrics up the wazoo written and saved on my computer by me, been playing the piano, singing and writing since age 3, been rapping since 2017. Practice is EVERYTHING. No matter how many times you\u2019ve practiced, it\u2019s never good until you know in your heart it\u2019s really good. And when it\u2019s really good, you know. Hope this helps. Drink a lot of water between singing songs, and give yourself time to rest your vocals. Check it out, I just found this for you on YouTube. Click on it and follow the instructions in the video. This will be fun for you. It\u2019s how you can find your vocal range. Let me know how you liked it and what your vocal range is. Also, if you ever do record something, I wanna hear it. You can email me. Just let me know, and one more thing. NEVER STOP SINGING and a lot of people like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston got most of their vocal training by being in a church choir. That\u2019s how both artists got started. They sang in church choir. Start singing in church. You\u2019ll find your voice, but in case you need assistance in this subject, click on the video below and write down your vocal range. Write down which note you can sing the highest without damaging or straining your voice, and write down which note you can sing the lowest and keep it with you.  ",
