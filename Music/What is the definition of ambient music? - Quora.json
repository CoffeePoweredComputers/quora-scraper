            "answer_text": "Ambient music can most concisely be described as sonic wallpaper. It does not demand your attention and focus in the manner pop music does; rather, it eschews conventional songwriting form in favor of using textural layers of sound to evoke an atmosphere or mood without using words or prevalent musical tropes, rewarding both passive and active listening. In the words of Brian Eno, the composer often credited with inventing the genre, \u201cAmbient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\u201d While most ambient music listeners often listen passively (while reading or focusing on unrelated tasks, for instance) and enjoy the music\u2019s ability to be evocative yet unobtrusive (i.e., the \u201csonic wallpaper\u201d metaphor), active listening reveals many subtle nuances undetectable when the music isn\u2019t given the appropriate amount of attention. There\u2019s no wrong way to listen to ambient music. The genre has grown to cover a lot of ground, including minimalist composers such as Daniel Lanois and Harold Budd, contemporary classical composers like Stars Of The Lid and Rachel\u2019s, heavily electronic musicians such as Aphex Twin and Autechre, the lo-fi drone of bands like Flying Saucer Attack and Loscil, the psychedelia-tinged, guitar-centric music of bands like Windy & Carl and Landing, and the highly synthesized power drone of bands like Growing and Emeralds. With such a vast variety of music and sub-genres that fall under the umbrella of \u201cambient music,\u201d it can be difficult at times to discern exactly what constitutes as ambient. The key element all these varying musicians have in common is experimentation in instrumental music which falls under the descriptions in the above paragraph. They all function as sonic wallpaper in their own unique, distinctive flavors. Ambient music challenges or alienates listeners as often as it makes fans of them because of its commonly slow-moving and abstract nature. Many people are of the mindset that ambient music equates to soundtracks, that it only has context when coupled with film and that it\u2019s not a valid or complete art form when taken on its own. In response to this, I quote avant-garde composer John Cage, whose words render this train of thought invalid and closed-minded: \u201cIf you develop an ear for sounds that are musical, it is like developing an ego. You begin to refuse sounds that are not musical and that way cut yourself off from a good deal of experience.\u201d The same can be applied to becoming accustomed to common, conventional songwriting structures & production methods and refusing anything separate from them, including those employed by ambient music.

            "answer_text": "To cut to the chase, ambient music is simply music without lyrics playing in the background while you are working or studying or reading. From my own experimention and experience since the early 90's, Baroque, Classical and New Age music selections are the best. These are my personal favourites: 1) For reading and writing, plus studying/revision/exam preparation: - 'Relax with the Classics', with its entire library of music selections from the Baroque and Classical era, published by the Lind Institute, San Francisco, USA;- any of the anti-frantic music selections from Stephen Halpern, e.g. 'Crystal Suite', 'Spectrum Suite', just to name a few; 2) Creative thinking and Problem solving, e.g. with Mathematics and Physics; - metamusic selections from the Monroe Institute, USA;-  any of the New Age music selections, as long as there are subtle  variations in the amplitude and tempo, e.g. Ray Lynch, van Gelis, Yanni,  Ravi Shankar, Kitaro (except his noisy drums);  Enjoy your listening!
