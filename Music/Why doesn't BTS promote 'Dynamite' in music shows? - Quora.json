            "answer_text": "Dynamite is an English single which was promoted in the West. Although Dynamite has around 18 wins in Korean music shows, it wasn\u2019t promoted there as it wasn\u2019t a Korean song. It\u2019s a surprise that a non-promoted song which wasn\u2019t even performed on the shows is getting so many wins but that\u2019s facts. Have a nice day\u2026 :) ",
