            "answer_text": "Nope, it\u2019s missing a lot of features compared to industry standard DAWs, for example decent automation editing and stable VST support. Tracktion 7 is pretty objectively a better free option. I used LMMS as a first DAW, but that was years ago when it was the best thing available for free. Things have changed a lot since then. If Tracktion 7 doesn\u2019t float your boat, you may want to check out Cakewalk by Bandlab, which in my opinion isn\u2019t as well refined, but it may suit your needs. You\u2019ll want to try T7 first though. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, it\u2019s one of the best free ones I think! Even though it does lack some features, it won\u2019t prevent you from completing a track if you only intend to use digital audio and not live (you can\u2019t record live in that DAW). It has come a long way and is open-source, so I think it will be going a lot further. Here is a tutorial to not only help you get started but to check it out so you can see if you like it.  ",
