            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a singular \u2018best\u2019 site for last-minute tickets. Tickets that are listed on resale websites are generally the same inventory being populated across multiple platforms (StubHub, Vivid Seats, SeatGeek, TickPick, etc) due to ticket resale software. A ticket broker will have a ticket broadcasting platform service that will enable them to list the same ticket across multiple sites at the same time. As a result, the same ticket may be seen and available on many websites all at once, so it\u2019s hard to differentiate inventory between one resale marketplace to another. More often, you see differences in available inventory is when tickets are being listed by individuals, or ticket brokers are excluding/not listed on certain ticket resale websites. This is where you may find potential \u2018best\u2019 inventory and pricing on certain resale websites over others. Think about it from a consumer standpoint - which resale marketplace makes it the easiest to list tickets/which marketplace do consumers trust the most? Generally speaking, this is StubHub and Vivid Seats (for the US at least). As a result, you may see a lot of inventory being listed on these websites that may not exist on other marketplaces. HOWEVER, this is not always the case. Some sellers may prefer to list their tickets on TickPick or SeatGeek, or other resale platforms. As a result, it\u2019s good practice to start with looking at your favourite ticket resale marketplace as a starting point, but then check out a couple of others to see if there is similar/different inventory available across each of them. When i\u2019m looking for tickets myself, I generally start all my searches by going to the box office website (ie Ticketmaster) and then using that as a comparison to StubHub. After that initial comparison, I will get a general idea of how much tickets cost across different websites, and then I will do a check for inventory across other platforms to see if there is similar/different inventory. Once done that, the important thing is to see if any of the resale websites have any promo codes that you can use to help reduce your price, and that will influence where I end up making my final ticket purchase. Vivid Seats will offer credit if you make a purchase through their app, StubHub and others will run various promos throughout the year, and then just always jumping back over to TickPick to see what the prices are over there since they list ticket as all-in pricing (to show \u2018no\u2019 fees). I have also done a YouTube video on how to buy last minute tickets below:  I also like to recommend using any cashback portals if you can when buying tickets to save yourself some additional cash such as Rakuten or others. Anything to save you some money! Be sure to take a look at my profile to learn more about me and subscribe to my YouTube channel where I post weekly videos on everything about tickets and how to buy them!
