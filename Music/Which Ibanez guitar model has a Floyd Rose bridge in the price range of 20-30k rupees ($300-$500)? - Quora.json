            "answer_text": "Ibanez grg270dx is the one that fits right in your budget. But as someone else has already mentioned, Floyd rose bridge on a budget is not that good, you'll have a tough time tuning it. Ibanez grg170dx is the same guitar with FAT10 floating bridge which will be easier to tune than the Floyd rose. And it's a really good axe you'll love the slim neck profile with jumbo frets and low action. I set up my own guitar and it's never a problem, I usually lock the bridge and make whatever adjustments necessary. Goodluck! ",

            "answer_text": "Ibanez GRG 270. It costs around INR 21K. It's pretty shitty though (as are all low budget Floyd Rose tremolos) and a nightmare to set up. I think I spent more time tuning my guitar than actually playing it when I owned one. If you can't extend your budget, you'd be better off getting a fixed bridge or a regular tremolo. Floyd Roses are pretty much a novelty in most genres anyways. ",
