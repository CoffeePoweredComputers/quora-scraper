            "answer_text": "I am answering this question because i thought i can help. I actually did a search and found this question to give answers :) According to me : parts of writing good lyrics Understand the basics : Like format of songwriting e.g verse chorus verse chorus bridge chours. Learn rhyming methods: eg AABB ABAB ABCB and so on. Listen to various songwriter who are known for good lyrics : bob dylan, joni mitchell, jhonny cash, lou reed, david bowie, tom waits. Read: Most budding songwriter think most of lyrical idea comes out of a melody but it actually comes out of the material you read and brainstormed along. Reading poetry literature and news not only gives you ideas and inspiration but also builds your vocabulary. And also subject matter for your song gets variety. Also paintings, art work, design, particle physics\u2026lol yeah go for theae subject matter as well. Experience : All the reading and learning basics will facilitate you to write songs, try combining your musical style. And see what you come up with. Record it on your phone, listen to it, make others listen to it ask them what they think. At this phase u might me getting serious feed backs and so take them seriously. Dont get dissapointed if people did not like it. Improve with Paitence: Keep writing songs, change your lyrical style, musical style, change rythm, change instrument, keep changing and keep experimenting , fuse concepts of lyrical styles, use serious metaphor along side wit, use similie along side cliche, make it ovious but make people guessing. Keep experimenting and finally out of pool of many songs you have wirtten select top 5 and rec them. P.S lyrics is like telling a story. So try and live a few life and translate that with tools i have mentioned above. P.P.S and do not forget to take rest some people think writing is lesuire. Not if u want to be good at it. Take few breaks and get back at it agian. Hope these advice can help u write good songs. ",

            "answer_text": "What an awesome question, which I wish many more lyricists were asking. 1) Learn all the old formal esthetics of rhymed and metered poetry. You don\u2019t have to follow those rules, at least not all the time, but they\u2019ll surely help you get the effects you\u2019re after. For example, listen to Nat King Cole\u2019s \u201cWalking My Baby Back Home\u201d and notice that word-phrases line up with note-phrases (dum-diddy-dum, \u201cGee but it\u2019s great\u201d) and the use of internal rhymes, to give the whole thing the gait of two people walking home, half-dancing, not caring if they get there soon. Or Dylan\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d with all those long vowels placed on a line that\u2019s virtually on one pitch (\u201cwhen your rooster crows at the break of dawn\u201d \u2014 ooo oh ay awww) Old-style poetics is where you start paying attention to what the words sound like, and sound is the critical thing in lyrics. \u201cBefore this river becomes an ocean, Before I pick my heart up off the floor, I\u2019ll reconsider this foolish notion\u201d \u2014 sure, Ocean and Notion rhyme, but did you catch the assonant rhyme between river and reconsider? 2) If you\u2019re writing after the music is composed, think about syntax and phrasing. Try to get the important words onto the places where the music stresses them. Remember that singing is, in a good measure, acting, and help the actor out by positioning phrases to take advantage of the tones and rhythm of the music. Listen to Sinatra\u2019s \u201cIn the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\u201d; it\u2019s a guy who lost a girl feeling bad about it at 3 am or so, and do you hear that every breath he takes is a forced sigh? That was written in the syntax and phrasing; the places where the singer takes a breath and hesitates are there in what the words do with the music. Or listen to any decent Irish band do \u201cThe Black Velvet Band\u201d and notice how all the sarcastic words about the guy\u2019s hard luck are on the UNemphasized beats; it\u2019s like he\u2019s muttering under his breath about the whole stupid situation that got him a seven-year-sentence, because the pretty girl he was hitting on turned out to be a pickpocket. 3. Have a few real feelings and see if you can make the song catch them exactly. Too many songs are just commercials for a hot-button phrase (\u201cI Write the Songs,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the Way I Like It\u201d, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d), or pulling up the nearest available rhyme (\u201cThe moon shines above, we\u2019re falling love\u201d \u201cYour charms, you arms\u201d that kind of thing), or maybe worst of all, leaving everything up to the listener to make sense out of. Since I mentioned \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right,\u201d compare that with \u201cJust One of Those Things\u201d, \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d and \u201cMrs. Brown You\u2019ve Got a Lovely Daughter.\u201d All four have narrators trying to stay cool and classy while their hearts break open, but it\u2019s four very different narrators \u2014 Dylan\u2019s is bitter but won\u2019t say so directly, Porter\u2019s is flippant and refusing to get sucked in to regret, Parton\u2019s is letting herself feel everything and insisting that her ex-lover know it\u2019s there, and the Herman\u2019s Hermits song is more worried about hurting his ex\u2019s feelings than he is about expressing his own. Precision, precision, precision, what feeling exactly are you capturing? Don\u2019t settle too easily. 4. While we\u2019re at it, can you make your narrator a precise someone? Who\u2019s telling this to whom? \u201cThe Streets of Laredo,\u201d Marty Robbins\u2019s \u201cRunning Gun\u201d, Elvis\u2019s \u201cIn the Ghetto,\u201d Scarface\u2019s \u201cSeen A Man Die,\u201d are all about a man dying too young for something too small, but the narrator is (in order) a casual acquaintance who just met him, the dying man himself, an all-seeing being outside the story, and a deeply understanding witness trying to report the truth. All four have the narrator they do for a reason; have a reason for your narrator too. ",

            "answer_text": "The history of human culture is essentially a hall of mirrors -an endless array of stories, themes and ideas, mounted and waiting for you to step up and consider the fascinating ways they each reflect your own distinct & intimate experience of being. All good songs capture either a reflection of broader humanity within which we can find ourselves or a reflection within ourselves wherein we can find a broader humanity. My personal favorite method to find ideas for good lyrics\u2026 Look for a story, myth, or legend to which you find yourself joyfully, strangely, or curiously attracted. Find a character, icon, or archetype with which you feel some identification, understanding or relationship. I.e. If you were a mythological character, who might you be? If you were living in an old movie or book, what story is it?Now notice experiences, arcs, or ideas lurking in the weft of your story or archetype that resonate with your own experience or that of a human you can solidly imagine and deeply empathize with.NOTE: For most writers trying this out, I recommend working from the perspective you know best: Your own. This can also be a poetic or archetypal \u201cyou\u201d -an exaggerated facet of yourself that you can imagine acting with freedom beyond your typical limitations. Keep in mind, though, that the advantage that abides in \u201cwrite what you know\u201d is likely a deeper authenticity in your consideration and an infusion of greater Truth into your lyrics.Now re-imagine the story as if your life is simply its reflection through the ages, as if any of your moments could be captured in its allegory, as if it is no less than a legend of you -all the little details and distractions, all the momentary concerns and nagging bullshit blasted away. What remains waiting to be recognized? What remains waiting for a reckoning? This is the substrate of profound poetry and epic lyric.Write your song. Rock your song.Go to Step 1.For a couple of personal examples, I offer\u2026 \u2018Dirty\u2019 -recorded by my band, Letters From Traffic. Narrated in the first person by the Devil (who is never overtly identified), Dirty reconsiders this character as fundamentally misunderstood -and a little frustrated that humans keep blaming him for their poor behavior and choices.\u2018Minotaur\u2019 -also recorded by Letters From Traffic and the inspiration for the \u2018Icarus Iterations\u2019 album. Narrated by a modern day incarnation of Icarus -then a successive Icarus in the second verse who sees the first one fall on the news. These iterations of Icarus continue to make the same mistake over and over again, flying and falling, dying and being reborn, struggling to find a lesson that will break the cycle. But they keep fundamentally missing that it\u2019s not an issue of flying too high. It\u2019s that some problems cannot be resolved by running away.The Minotaur is in all of us. It is our shadow, those un-integrated parts of Self that we project into the world as the prime model of monsterhood and villiany because we cannot tolerate the idea that we might have them inside us.",

            "answer_text": "Here, I am referring to lyrics of both songs and poetry to provide a better idea. Expand your vocabulary- read books and other stuff to get used to more and more words and find excellent rhyming for your creation.Do what your heart says- Lyrics of a song/poetry comes right from the heart. Try combining your heart's thoughts along with your expanded vocabulary and reasoning skills.Listen to other songs and poetry- This will provide you an opportunity to get acquainted wuth new words and will clear your \u201cwhere to use what\u201d kind of confusions. (Try not copying entire lyrics though)Using choicest words- Make sure your lyrics are meaningful and the words you use match the overall idea of your song/poetry. Try avoid using vulgar lyrics if you are going for the first time. They can ruin the overall mood of the song.Remain in sentence length- Try to make all the lines in your creation take equal time to recite. If it is a poetry, you can adjust the recital speed however, in a song, you need to follow the metronome. So, try lengthening your lyrics accordingly. Happy Songwriting\u2026 _R\u00b0N_ ",

            "answer_text": "I agree, lyric writing is really hard. The thing to know is that sites like RhymeZone.com and Thesaurus.com are your friends. Writing lyrics is all about expressing your emotion in a way that fits the formula, so sometimes the word that you want to use isn\u2019t actually the best word too use. There\u2019s also a lot of rearranging sentences. One word might not have a lot of rhymes, so you have to reconfigure the sentence to put an easier word at the end. You might have a syllable requirement in order for it to fit within the tune of the song. Maybe a sentence just doesn\u2019t sound right with the movement of the song. Don\u2019t be afraid to make sentences a little bit ridiculous too! I mean, there are some sentences that are grammatically correct that you wouldn\u2019t want to use because they sound weird, but many that would be weird in normal conversation are okay in normal music. The final thing is that, as much as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it, practice! It doesn\u2019t come easily to a lot of people, but it\u2019s a great emotional outlet and you should keep trying at it. I hope this helps! ",

Every melody ought to give an alternate turn or point of view to the idea.  4)Write verses about something you have perused about in a daily paper or magazine. Alternately maybe something you saw on television.  5)How about buzzwords? Simply turn on your radio and you will hear the same prosaic being rehashed again and again. In the event that you utilize these same prosaic you won't see much achievement. ",

What happened to your life, happy or sad, will be the point you can start from. First, determine the excerpt of your feeling. Choose the deepest feeling as the main idea. Start to imagine the story\u2019s beginning. Second, keep the story line simple. The complicated one will have not-focused end. Not only ambigous, but doesn\u2019t make sense as well. Third, insert your own or other\u2019s experiences to complete the story to make it lively. Don\u2019t feel guilty to write something dramatic in your text, whether it is real or imaginative. Imagine that your (future) song listeners expect some new experiences. Fourth, make sure that you rely on certain story ending and the text not to long. Brief song is more likely easier to remember.

If they are not it might be disturbing for some people.Usually rhymes are key for good lyrics. Check out the link for different types of rhymes. Types of RhymeIf you want to have a chorus, make sure that this part is easy to remember and also catchy. (I would repeat the chorus at least 2 or 3 times).If you have already written the music (if you want music of course) make sure the lyrics go along with it because you probably dont want to have two different styles.These are my thoughts, I hope its helpful.

For example, in my case, i pick up topics which will send a message through an overall song. I prefer topics like war, soldiers, addictions, famous personalities, life, death. You can pick up ideas for writing a lyrics even while walking down a road. Look at the things not through your normal eyes but through the eyes of lyricist. For example, walking down the road you see an isolated tree which surrouneded by cars, pollution and all garbage. This can give you the hint to write a lyrics on how to fight alone or how environment is affecting our nature or about the tree with the title of the lyrics as \u201c I am the elder tree and i have seen it all, from the big bang to dooms day call\u2019.
