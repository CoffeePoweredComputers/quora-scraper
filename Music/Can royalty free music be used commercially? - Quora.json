            "answer_text": "Royalty-Free music means you are not paying a per-use fee, once for each display to a different person. It means you are paying a flat fee, possibly as low as zero. Thus it is different than \u201cfree\u201d. You can use that music in accordance with the terms of the use license that is given to you. Hopefully you are getting one that matches your planned use.  It is not uncommon for some recording artists to allow their music to be completely free to people that are not using it commercially, and then to ask for a single upfront fee to get a royalty-free license that allows commercial use. If you\u2019re making money, they want to make some money. Really, that\u2019s only fair. But again, the terms of the use license are the deciding factor here, not how much you paid. ",
