            "answer_text": "Traditional form is a bit flexible depending on the sub culture.  For instance an opera seria in France includes a ballet... usually end up being 4-5 acts... comedies are usually shorter but that's a relative term.  The generalized form would be 3 acts  devided into Act 1: introductions/presenting lovers ect. & a sneak peak at the villan.  Act 2: Major confrontation with villan. Act 3 Fallout, last love duet and a death or two....Consider that th\u00e8 opera is the evening out. So 4-5 hours isn't do long when you're drinking and commenting with your friends during scene changes... sitting quietly for hours at a time is a relatively new concept.  Opera Composers have been breaking any \"rules\" as fast as they could get away with it. So while the structure exists,  it's been a adjusted so often as to be irrelevant. ",
