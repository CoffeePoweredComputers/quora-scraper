But guy can\u2019t move on he can\u2019t love someone again maybe. He still loves her. \u2018\u2019Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt youBut ain't nobody need you like I do\u2019\u2019 This lines kinda reminds me of my furst breakup. I never cared of her when she was with me. She used to do special things for me. I tried to push her a little by little. She still tried to stay with me. She realised she can\u2019t hold any longer and brokeup with me. Now I miss her alot and begged her to come back she loves someone and is happy with him. It\u2019s kinda hurting. I want her back. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no official video of the song \u201cHappier\u201d by Ed Sheeran. The video which appears as the top result stars Chris Evans and Alice Eve. It is a very well-crafted compilation of clippings from the movie \u201cBefore We Go\u201d. I too was intrigued by the video at first and wasn\u2019t able to decipher what it is trying to convey. I had to watch the movie to understand the context. The movie is a good watch so instead of reiterating the story, I\u2019d recommend watching the movie. ",
