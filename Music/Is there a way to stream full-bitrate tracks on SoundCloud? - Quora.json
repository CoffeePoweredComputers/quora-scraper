            "answer_text": "SoundCloud permits higher bitrate downloads IF the user posts them. Higher bitrates such as 1411 Kbits/sec wav or higher are fine but unnecessary. Check out this article - http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/emperors-new-sampling-rate/365968 - in which a group of \"discerning listeners\" (sound engineers, audiophile nuts, classical music appreciators, etc.) were tested to determine if they could discern the difference between 320 Kbits/sec mp3 and 1411 Kbits/sec wav. The results were 50 % accuracy which is no better than a coin toss or an untrained monkey performing the test. In other words, they were guessing. Chances are a \"bad\" quality mix is either intentional, commensurate with a genre, or it is the result of poor mixing decisions, choice of sounds, composition, arrangement, improper microphone phase switch position as recorded to a digital recording medium (or tape - if your old school), or too much or too little compression. Therefore, there is not much point in providing a higher bit rate (and depth) than 1411 Kbits/sec at 16 bits. But it is nice to have the choice. For a more heady explanation check out this interesting, coffee drinking guy (Monty Montgomery) on YouTube -    - especially 8:30 to 11:40. Processing audio is a different story which explains why most Digital Audio Workstations perform calculations in 24 bits or 32 bit floating point (more dynamic range than you'll ever need, no loss of dynamic range, period). By the way the reason why CD's sound louder if played on a DVD Blu-ray player is because the movie industry uses a (more dynamic range) different audio standard that mimics an audio metering system, these days, called K-20 Metering which allows 20 dB dynamic headroom. Music audio is generally mixed way higher than that due to \"loudness wars\" (which should have been over by now) or it is has had a compressor applied to the signal (usually multiband). ",

            "answer_text": "As much as I can understand your desire for this, as a producer I hope this doesn't happen: people rip audio from soundcloud in a variety of ways (easiest being recording what's coming out of your speakers or recording your soundcard output).  If people can stream at 320, all original content on soundcloud can be stolen.  At the moment only low quality versions can be taken. ",
