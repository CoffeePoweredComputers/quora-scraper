            "answer_text": "That is both an easy and complex question, so let\u2019s do easy first. As a rule, in the United States the terms lawyer and attorney are interchangeable. Now for the hard answer. It\u2019s hard because we have to go back a bit in history to understand the distinctions. The term \u201clawyer\u201d was generally used to refer to any person who has studied and been trained in the law. The lawyers of the early US nationhood are a good example. Someone like John Adams or Thomas Jefferson were not only leaders of the American Revolution but they also were lawyers. An interesting note on Adams career is that he actually provided a learned, principled and successful defense of the British Soldiers accused of crimes arising from the \u201cBoston Massacre.\u201d His reason was the same that many criminal defense attorneys cite today for their own careers. Every person, no matter how they are seen by the general public, deserves a zealous and competent defense (something we now find in the 6th Amendment of the Constitution). As education in the US improved, and law began to become its own discipline, the term attorney at law (also attorney-at-law) was created around 1768. For a short time there was an effort to distinguish the two terms. The lawyer was one who studied and graduated after studying law, however, they were not necessarily seen as someone who had passed the bar; therefore they did not \u201cpractice law\u201d before a court. Even today we see that one can graduate from an American law school, thus becoming a lawyer, but not passing the bar exam. Without the passing score on the bar exam one can\u2019t be admitted to practice law in the jurisdiction (state or federal). The attorney at law, which was later shortened to just attorney, was used in some instances to mean a professional who is qualified to give legal advise and to represent a party in court. Eventually, the early form of the law degree (which was considered a professional degree much like that for the ministry or medicine) evolved to a point that it would require a much higher level of education in order to be reasonably qualified. Today, the terms attorney and lawyer are used interchangeably, mostly because the need to distinguish the right to practice law became so well defined with the expansion of the individual jurisdictions judicial system and also because the qualifying degree today to sit for the bar exam is a professional doctorate degree; usually the Juris Doctorate or JD. There are still those who graduate from law school but never sit for the bar exam. The law degree is an excellent degree which can be used in many areas of business and government work other than the practice of law. Thus, the concept that one is a lawyer by virtue of the law degree still exists, it is just not enforced at enthusiastically as in the 19th and early 20th centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "Claudio, I have read many answers to this question, and my head is spinning. The difference between an attorney and a lawyer is none; they are interchangeable, at least in the United States. The word lawyer doesn't sound as professional or distinguished. I don't understand why the previous answers would even be addressed if the law is in another country. The law is already incredibly confusing and complicated in the United States. The fact that so many other answers are also addressing the law in other countries, is only adding to the confusion, and isn't answering the question- \u201cWhat is the difference between an attorney and a lawyer?\u201d. The person who asked the question, and I'm assuming that he/she lives in the United States of America, would be referring to the US. The definitions that are used in foreign countries, shouldn't even be addressed in this answer, because they don't use the terms of attorney and lawyer. It's hard enough to distinguish between the fact that we have 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands; and then, on top of that, the laws differ from state to state, province, and the islands. According to many different sites on Google and the internet, the research is abundant and, surprisingly, hypocritical. \u201cGenerally speaking, an attorney, or attorney-at-law, is a person who is a member of the legal profession. An attorney is qualified and licensed to represent a client in court.\u201d By most definitions, an attorney may act on the client's behalf, and plead or defend a case in legal proceedings. A lawyer, by definition, is a person who is trained in the field of law, and provides advice and aid in legal matters. Because a lawyer also conducts suits in court proceedings, and represents clients in many legal instances, the term has expanded to overlap the definition of attorney. An attorney and a lawyer both have to go to undergraduate school for 4 years. Then, they both have to attend law school for an additional 3 years. An attorney cannot practice law in the US, until he passes the Bar Exam, and be sworn in to uphold the law. And, even after 7 years of school, and passing the Bar, they are only allowed to practice law in that state. This next part is tricky, when I stated that different sites were being hypocritical. A lawyer, who has also taken and passed the Bar Exam to obtain the license to practice law, is basically indistinguishable from an attorney. Not all lawyers may choose to take the Bar. In the United States, attorneys and lawyers are normally considered to be synonyms. \u201cAlthough the terms often operate as synonyms, an attorney is a lawyer, but a lawyer is not necessarily an attorney.\u201d. This is still going towards the hypocrisy of the law, or of the information provided on several sites of the internet. \u201cMostly it seems to be a matter of semantics, at least in the US. Technically, one can be a lawyer by graduating law school, even though they are not licensed to practice law\u201d. The US is challenging enough, so the definitions of barrister and solicitor only further complicate the question. Those two terms would be better served in a different question. Each and every state has their own set of laws. Someone mentioned something about the history of law in the US; and almost everyone had something to say about other countries' laws. That's why I felt that it would be easier to keep it within the US. An attorney and a lawyer are, for all intents and purposes, the same. Attorney sounds more formal; however it does not negate the fact that a lawyer is equal, and can represent you in court, have Power of Attorney, etc. There is one technicality between an attorney and a lawyer. All attorneys are lawyers, but all lawyers are not attorneys. Several attorneys and lawyers who answered this question do not differentiate between the two. Upon further research, it appears that an attorney is permitted to do anything under the law. However, the same isn't true for a lawyer. A lawyer usually means that he has graduated law school, but he hasn't taken the Bar Exam. If he hasn't taken and passed the Bar Exam, he isn't permitted or allowed to practice the law. He cannot represent you in court. I would be just as confused about the difference, after reading most of the answers. It may be that the person who was confused about the difference between an attorney and a lawyer before, may be even more unsure about the question after having written in. I am not an attorney nor a lawyer; I am not giving you or anyone else professional advice on any case pending or otherwise. I hope that you have found an answer to your question, by all the attorneys, law students, and everyone else who has written in. The history of the law was extremely educational, informative, and an accurate description of how the law came into being. I was also impressed that so many of you were, not only educated in the US law, but also in the legal terminology and process of England and the UK, as well as the definitions between a Barrister and a Solicitor.
