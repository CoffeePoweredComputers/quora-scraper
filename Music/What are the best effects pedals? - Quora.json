            "answer_text": "I'm a guitar player with 22 years experience. I don't know if there is one \"Best\" pedal builder. There are countless pedal builders, from major manufacturers like Roland and Dunlop to the smaller ones like Wampler and Dr. Scientist. Each and every one of them does some amazing things. The \"best\" to you is different than the \"best\" to me.  Personally, I'm a fan of MXR effects and have a number of them, but I also have Boss, Ibanez, Maxxon, Line 6 and others in addition to some I have have had custom made to suit a purpose. The best thing to do is try everything you can get your hands on for a particular function and let your ears be the judge. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you want to do. People\u2019s favorites tend to reflect what they like doing and how cool/unique or helpful the pedal is to their playing style. There are tons of big companies like Boss, MXR, and TC Electronic that make all types of pedals but also hundreds more small companies making boutique pedals and pedals for budget musicians. There are fun pedals like loopers, delay pedals, reverb pedals, modulators and fuzz. These are the best pedals for people that want to push the envelop and be creative and experimental. Then there are also practical pedals. If you just want a couple pedals to keep it simple, you might think a solid distortion or overdrive pedal, compression pedal, tuner, volume pedal, or equalizer would be the best pedal for you. I wrote more here: What Guitar Effects Pedal Should I Buy? There\u2019s a ton of pedals on that site that are relatively cheaper than big-name brands like Boss or TC Electronic. You can also go the used route - check out craigslist or reverb (the website) for used pedals. Good luck! ",
