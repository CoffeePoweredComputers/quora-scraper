            "answer_text": "The whole thread is turning into debate of who are better looking - Light skin or darker skin? Trust me there is no Indian actress better than these 2, because beauty of actress (& a lady) is not only in sense of her face but also personality, intelligence & poise.  Sharmila Tagore & Saira Banu Sharmila Tagore \u2013 Sharmila Tagore Far beyond any one can debate on! You can call her Audrey Hepburn of east. The elegant, beautiful, chirpy girl with dimples. She is beauty queen in every sense. Gave many super hits & made many songs legends. The most iconic were from Aradhana \"Mere Sapno Ki Rani Kab Ayegi Tu\" (The Blue snap) & \"Kora Kagaz tha ye man mera\". Even now in the old age she looks magnificent. But in her earlier days she was just like an angel on earth. On google there are very few snaps from her stardom days. Someone actually need to see her movies to see her that beauty. Married to late king & best Indian cricketer of of that time, HM Masoor Ali Khan Pataudi aka Tiger Pataudi. She is Her Majesty Sharmila Tagore Pataudi.           With her husband.     (present day) Saira Banu - Saira Banu Grace Kelly of Bollywood. Acted in many Bollywood movies between 1960 - 80. Been married to the best actor or you can say King of Bollywood is not the only reason which makes her queen. Born in India in elite family, brought up between India and UK plus Switzerland's finishing school gave an ultimate product which is as heavenly as the flower bud of Kashmir. Padosan, Junglee, Purab Paschim are just few names of hit movies she acted in. Her songs are just what she is. Beautiful. When she wore that rose pink kashmiri outfit and danced in Junglee in song \"Kashmir ki kali hun main\" it made her iconic figure. Even today when Kashmir comes in discussions (in context to Bollywood) some one will surely start humming her this famous song. And so the other song \"unse mili nazar ke mere hosh ud gaye\" is total statement of condition of man who seen her. She is really that persona which will make any person speechless. She is Saira Banu.          ",
