            "answer_text": "Because your blood pressure is a lit bit higher than usual during the mornings. When you blood pressure is higher the music would sound slower to you. You can try it during a gym session; listen to a song and then run and listen the same song again, you will notice the difference. I am not exactly sure why this happens though. It could be the hormones like adrenaline to help you realize the environment and danger (although there is no danger at all) as it is. Maybe you have experienced such thing like when someone asks you a question you don\u2019t know, you get firghtened and stressed, you could feel your heart beating faster because your heart is pumping your blood to your brain to make you think more to find the answer. Adrenaline can cause your blood pressure to be higher and maybe the higher blood pressure can trigger a bit of adrenaline. Or maybe you just need more blood to pumped to your brain and to other muscles/organs during the mornings to get you ready and steady after a long rest/sleep. I think this option is a bit more relevant and reliable. :) ",
