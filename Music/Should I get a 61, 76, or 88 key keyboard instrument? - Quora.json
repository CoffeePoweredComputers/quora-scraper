            "answer_text": "This will depend on your genre. It will also depend on what functions you will need for your style. An upscale keyboard can do basically anything an entire band can do such as play VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS VIA KEYBOARD. Also sound effects, background sounds and such all play into this. This is also why guys like Geddy Lee of Rush have a STACKED KEYBOARD set up with each keyboard having a specifically designed and set up function so multiple keyboards can be worked simultaneously each with a different sound and result function. A 61 is basically an electronic PIANO. The other add on keys as FOR FUNCTIONS. I know guys who always use a keyboard for the functions only and I know guys who play them as an actual portable piano. I would urge you to go to a pawn shop where you should find a decent selection of them and examine the added keys. This may be too complex for a beginner level. So then you will know to go simple. ALSO I have seen some stellar deals on pro grade keyboards at pawn shops and I am talking Yamaha concert grade boards for $200 OR LESS. ONE OTHER THING TO KNOW\u2026. 61 IS A BASIC AND WILL HAVE LIMITED INTERFACE PLUGS. The more advanced the keyboard is the MORE INTERFACE PORTS THERE WILL BE ON BOARD and I have seen panels on the back side of these with many input and output ports. That if you are trying to start a band will be crucial, ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a contrarian view. While 88-key keyboards are more flexible by definition (more keys mean more range in playing), stages tend to be tight and 61-key keyboards take up less space. I play bass and keyboards, with my equipment taking up a lot of real estate on stage. I have one 88-key, two 61-key and a midi workstation for my \"rig\". I may drop the 88-key to make my life less cumbersome. But the downside is fewer keys, so some songs will require two separate keyboards programmed with different octaves. That's a nuisance. And as many keyboardists will tell you - the more you have to change parameters between songs, the more opportunity for screwing it up. And you usually learn of that mistake mid-song. That's especially hard to correct on the fly when you are also singing. The complexity, though, is part of the fun! ",
