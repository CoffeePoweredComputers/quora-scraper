Usually copyright is owned by the symphony organization or an appointed representative. This case was unusual. In this case, the copyright was owned by each member of the symphony with no assigned representative. In order to use the music he would have had to get a copyright license from each individual musician. Disney ran into trouble using \u201cThe Lion Sleeps Tonight\u201d. In that case they obtained license from the person who had been duly authorized to grant license for the song. However the agent and Disney lawyers overlooked South African laws that granted the agent rights for a limited number of years, and they reverting back to the original composer. The agent had supposedly failed to realize he no longer had authority and Disney went ahead with the assumption he was the authorized agent and used the music in good faith. Good faith or not, this resulted in a lawsuit by the composer against Disney. . ",

If you paid attention you\u2019d see how the songs used in the movie are permitted without penalty. The movie crew is trained to do all that is necessary to secure all rights needed for each use of any creative work presented in a movie. You get permission to use any copyrighted work by asking nicely in a formal letter. There is likely to be a fee charged. There is a risk of rejection if the composer, artist or holding company does not approve of or like your movie. ",
