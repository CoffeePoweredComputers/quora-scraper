            "answer_text": "(I have been working at Deezer in 2012\u20132013 and now work at Spotify) Where does Deezer stand in it\u2019s competitive landscape? By counts of paying subscribers, Deezer is still within the top players of the music streaming market. Spotify now has 60M paying subscribers, Apple Music has 27M, the chinese Tencent has 15M (paying a low price though), and Deezer comes fourth at around 6M, above Pandora (4.4M) and way above Tidal (about 1M) or other local players (KKBox in east Asia, Saavn in India, Anghemi in the Middle East, etc.). Amazon Prime Music is the dark horse in this race, as it comes with Prime membership and no Music specific numbers are disclosed. How is Deezer doing? Deezer\u2019s staff is currently at around 450, and has been growing steadily from what I can tell. This mostly Paris-based team keeps on developing the product to keep it competitive. It is investing in the personalization trend with personalized artist radios and the Flow product, keeps a strong editorial voice throughout the product, and has dramatically improved the UI over the past years. Deezer is surely outpaced on many topics by a six-times bigger headcount at Spotify, but still does better than a bunch of its competitors. In Jan 2016, Deezer secured $110M in funding in a serie E round, which gives it some time and room to compete. It also re-assured on Deezer\u2019s financial profile after an IPO that was rolled back at the last minute, and what appears as stalling growth. Internationally, Deezer has historically had an aggressive strategy of opening in almost every country in the world to get a first entrant advantage. This strategy has proven efficient in some Latin American and European countries, but a lot of foreign offices have been closed over the past 3 years. The service is still available in those countries, but the focus has been reshuffled to key markets and specific entertainment verticals, like sports partnerships or podcasts. Hope that sheds some light! ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I am aware, Deezer is moderately successful and growing. However, they have clearly lost the internet mindshare war to Spotify and Apple at this point. If you like their software the best, or at least are comfortable with it, then I think you\u2019re probably fine to stay with them for now. I can\u2019t guarantee they will stick around forever, though. Internet sectors tend to be winner take all (or at most support duopolies) and all of these services are predicated on high growth. There have been a string of high-profile executive departures from Deezer in the last year, and where there\u2019s smoke\u2026. ",
