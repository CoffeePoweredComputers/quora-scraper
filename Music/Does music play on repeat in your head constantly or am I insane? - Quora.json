            "answer_text": "No, you are not insane. In musician\u2019s circles, this phenomenon is called, \u201cearworms.\u201d We accept it as a natural consequence of life in the music lane, often joking about it. Somebody might play an annoying little musical phrase and with a squint say, \u201cHere\u2019s your earworm for the day,\u201d as a teasing jab. If in fact, you are insane, then join the club and we\u2019ll swap stories about the most vexing little earworm we\u2019ve ever encountered. True story: Last Sunday, I was going over my final preps for a 250 mile motorcycle day trip. I wanted to be sure I had adequate food, water, camera batteries, money, driver\u2019s license and so forth all accounted for and stowed on the bike. Checklist complete, it was time to roll. Ooops! I was fully suited up and ready to press the starter button when I realized I\u2019d forgotten something. The irritating little musical theme I\u2019d heard on You Tube an hour earlier was still playing over and over in my head. It was a horrid little ditty. Off come the riding gloves and belt pack to access my iPhone and do a quick search for \u201cfilm score music.\u201d The first thing to pop up was the opening theme for \u201cChronicles of Narnia.\u201d Good enough. Fifteen seconds later, I had a nice melody planted in my head to take with me for the ride. Hang in friend. Our brain has evolved with some peculiar little quirks that we just have to deal with. ",
