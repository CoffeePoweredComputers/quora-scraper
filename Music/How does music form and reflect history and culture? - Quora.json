            "answer_text": "Any given kind of music is a reflection of the socioeconomic, cultural, and technological forces which have given rise to it. I\u2019d consider this to be a fundamental feature of music, not something tangential; for me, it\u2019s just as critical to the nature of music as any sort of theoretical analysis. Even though I do appreciate and genuinely enjoy it sometimes, still I find something a little repulsive about EDM on the whole. I can only handle it in small doses. The way I interpret it \u2014 and certainly this is subjective to a large degree, as it would be for anyone \u2014 is that EDM embraces the fast-paced, highly sensory-stimulating, relentlessly (and, one might argue, somewhat thoughtlessly) forward-moving pace of \u201cModern Life.\u201d That\u2019s one plausible example of how EDM reflects and celebrates our current historical/cultural coordinates, including our increasing reliance on computers.  Being a misanthropic and capital-R Romantic sort of personality myself, most comfortable when surrounded by piles of books and papers I pretend to read despite the dust, or perhaps in a deep forest or on a desolate beach with not more than one or two other humans anywhere in sight and yet with a smartphone in my pocket, the aggressively metronomic quality of synthesized dance music is not endearing to me. I can dig it now and again, (and how!), but it never really feels like me. My ooms, ooms, ooms-ing has tight limits, even when listening to what I consider to be the primo stuff. Some people have comparable reactions to (Western) classical music, particularly post-Bach and pre-Beethoven, the capital-C Classical Era. Beautiful and genius or not, Gl\u00fcck or Haydn just sound like snobbery to them. Again, that\u2019s subjective, but also rooted in actual historical/cultural circumstance. This was relatively tidy music of the princely courts, after all, and not intended for the likes of you lot with your boring worldly troubles, so scram on back to the salt mines before we have you beheaded. Now, I don\u2019t experience Mozart in that way, socialist farmboy though I am \u2014 I find within his music a great deal of depth and beauty and a vast emotional range \u2014 but I do understand the association and its legitimate origin. Perhaps this Sch\u00f6nbrunn artifice, unbearable to some, reads more to me like a beautifully crafted story enjoyed at bedtime in childhood; I don\u2019t know. I love to play Mozart. But I only truly have fun with him in a tank-top and flip-flops. Puffy shirts and breeches, not so much.  Furthermore, consider that the Renaissance emergence of instrumental music as a detailed and complex art form was intimately tied to a decline in power of Catholic Rome, for whom sacred choral music needed to be kept under constraints so as not to offend the Lord and overexcite the congregants. Naturally it speaks to the concomitant rise of the mercantile and noble classes who were busy sponsoring this newfangled flute-and-fiddle mess as they kicked their nosy, needy cardinals down the lane. In this way, instrumental classical music and its aesthetic values represent the rise of humanism quite directly, documenting a changing economic and intellectual landscape. That\u2019s the backdrop for Henry VIII\u2019s ugly divorces and Bach\u2019s beautiful Lutheran cantatas. Think of the bebop jazz practiced by Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Clifford Brown, and so many other amazing musicians in the 1940s and 1950s \u2014 simplistically, the movement was a reaction against boring, schmaltzy, commercialized crap (jazz as pop). It was also fairly explicitly a rebellion by genius black musicians against white, moneyed, lawyered songwriters and publishers. That\u2019s why the college kids loved it so well, as many still do. Rock and Roll was at its core a democratizing trend. Few can soar as Bird did on the saxophone, but pretty much anybody could buy an affordable electric guitar from Sears or somewhere, plug it in, and wreak havoc on three or four chords all night long out in the garage. Beyond this, its twang, electric passion, and lyrical content tell of a culture on the cusp of a sexual revolution \u2014 while subtextually broadcasting America\u2019s troubled relationship with civil rights in an era of manicured lawns and torturously inventive Jell-o molds. Music doesn\u2019t always participate in the culture by celebrating it, of course; sometimes its role is to run the hell away. This was largely the case with nineteenth-century European Romanticism, which flourished in opposition to industrialization, urbanization, and the unreasonable demands imposed by collectivist social contracts. Romanticism in music, art, and letters was a kind of anti-Enlightenment: Byron running off to Greece instead of getting a job somewhere deep within in the Heavenly Clockwork Corporation like the rest of us. Schubert lived most of his life on other people\u2019s couches. Liszt started as a playboy and ended up a priest with his own castle.  The question is a fine one, but expansive! Have fun investigating the historical/cultural substrates of many different individual flavors of music \u2014 you\u2019ll learn a lot and gain a greater appreciation, for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I\u2019ll try to separate what is sung (text only) and what is played (instruments sound and, in most of the cases, melody from what is sung). Analyzing technically what is played, here are some topics we can consider: Different modes can achieve different feelings or impressions from the composer which could denote a society characteristic or a historical moment. Modes also can be peculiar from a specific music style from a specific place evidencing the tradition and historical culture from where it came.Music texture is also very important. Some music styles are defined by how their tempo are built and the way how they\u2019re constructed and structured. A great diversity of rhythms is perceived on different cultures. The instruments timbre can also identify the characteristics of a region due to the way how these instruments are built and by the types of materials used in their construction.Theme, motif and specific melody constructions also can connote and directly express the composer feelings. Some composers could built a very unique melody style, like Chopin, for instance. His melody style strongly represents his period, the romantic era.Music (played part) can easily make history and form culture mainly once it innovates. The New Russian School (The Five) or even Les Six are good examples of innovation and construction of a new musical culture. About the text part (what is generally sung) we can say that it can directly reflects a historical moment, a particular feeling, a cultural moment, a strand etc. Is hard to see a music that\u2019s not contextualized. The anthem of a nation shows it identity and build their population values, for example. A lot of Rap music talks about society problems and helps to develop social consciousness. Music can educate, motivate, destroy, discipline, thrill and sensitize a lot of other human specific characteristics. ",
