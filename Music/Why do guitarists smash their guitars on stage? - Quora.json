            "answer_text": "To smash a guitar on a stage being watched by an enthralled audience is something to behold indeed.  It's seen as a fitting, blunt \"period\" at the end of (what is hoped to have been) a cataclysmic denouement.  It's a thing of beauty that can cement a band's performance in the hearts and minds of everyone that witnesses it.  It's destroying something beautiful (like being the first to walk in new fallen snow). It's also, yet another reason why I love a cheap guitar.  Smashing a $40 Strat copy against a home town stage is...cathartic release. Years ago, musical performance was seen and performed as a polite, polished act.  You walked in, shuffled quickly to your places, thanked the audience for allowing you the pleasure of performing for them, then, the performance commenced. Nothing audacious or \"outside the box\" would be tolerated, no, no.  Musicians were to be heard not seen.Then, everything wound down.  The conclusion was reached, everyone stood, bowed and shuffled back stage to break down their instruments and afterward either bussed out of there or went home. Rarely was anything \"too flashy\".  Should it be seen as such, you might not be hired again.  The \"flash\" was usually left up to the singer. As Mr. Cab Calloway can easily demonstrate...    And that's how it went for a while, the singer standing out doing his \"thing\" while the musicians (guitar player included) sat humbly to the rear providing the backdrop.  Then came the electric guitars and the amplifiers.  Electric guitars and their amps allowed the guitarist to finally be heard on an equal footing with the drums and horns.  Things changed after that.  Guitar playing started to edge it's way into the spotlight and it's been comfortable in it ever since. Why am I telling you all of this?  Because it ends in a smashed guitar. Although the first guitar smashing, for the motivations we're talking about, were probably out of frustration, their impact was immediate.  Nothing like that had ever happened before.  It shocked. It startled and drew attention. And for the first time, it gave the guitarist something a singer couldn't top.  So, for some it became a gimmick, but, as with all thinks artistic it was used in different ways with varying degrees of success.  Pete Townshend is believed to be the first in the \"smashing for art\" arena.  He also invented distortion according to him (I always thought it was Dick Dale but, who knows.)    Today, guitar smashing is seen as a running out of a really, really great and energetic show.   The mood just hits you.  Imagine, maybe as the thunderous end of some tune you were playing came off amazing. Your band brings it to conclusion; the guitar's final chord hangs in the air, the bass is ringing out on the low end, the drummer rumbles on in an impromtu drum fill/solo and right at that moment...that great and wonderful guitar amp starts feeding back; it's scratchy drone coming in low and starting to rise.  A calamity of sound swells. Everyone is watching with anticipation that something, ANYTHING is about to happen. All eyes are on you and boom.     What better way to bring everyone down from the amazing heights you've taken them to musically than with the bombastic devastation of the instrument that got them there?  End it with a bow? I think not. ",

            "answer_text": "At its core, Rock & Roll is about energy, rebellion and defying the status quo. The act of destroying a guitar on-stage, especially as the finale for a show, embodies that spirit for many, and it is as iconic a Rock & Roll image as a Marshall stack. Sometimes bands do it in a celebratory manner, getting so caught up in the moment of playing to a crowd and feeding off their energy and the music's energy that it crescendos into the beautiful chaos of smashing their instruments, and sometimes it's out of frustration after (or even during) a bad show in which the sound is handled poorly, the guitar doesn't hold its tune properly, or the band is just off their game as a whole. The negative part of it is when it stops becoming a natural part of the set, when bands begin doing it so often that it becomes expected of them and audiences go home disappointed if there isn't any instrument destruction in the finale. For instance, Kurt Cobain had a slew of cheaper Mexican- and Japanese-made Strats and replacement necks that he took on tour with him specifically for the instrument destruction finales - they were later salvaged and their usable parts pieced together to make new Strats for him to break all over again. At that point, it becomes a mockery of the act, a cliche, and bands like Nirvana will understandably get burned out on doing it. More often than not, it's a waste of an instrument, though when the pieces of a guitar destroyed by a famous player get tossed into the crowd, they become treasured collector's items and often get circulated around through auctions that raise money for people in need of it, so some good comes out of it.
