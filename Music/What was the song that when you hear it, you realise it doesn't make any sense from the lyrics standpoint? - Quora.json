            "answer_text": "I would say my favourite example of this is Inside, by Stiltskin. The lyrics are total nonsense but sound cool: Swing low In a dark glass hourYou turn and cowerSee it turn to dustMove on a stone dark nightWe take to flightSnowfall turns to rust Seam in a fusing mineLike a nursery rhymeFat man starts to fallHere in a hostile placeI hear your face start to call And if you thinkThat I've been losing my wayThat's because I'm slightly blindedAnd if you thinkThat I don't make too much senseThat's because I'm broken minded Don't keep it...InsideIf you believe itDon't keep it all inside Strong wordsIn a gangja skyI have to lieShadows move in pairs Ring out from a blues postcardIn the shooting yardLooking through the tearsOut of a black slate timeWe move in lineBut never reach an end Falling along straight downAs the ice comes downRivers start to bend And if you thinkThat I've been losing my wayThat's because I'm slightly blindedAnd if you thinkThat I don't make too much senseThat's because I'm broken minded Don't keep it...InsideIf you believe itDon't keep it all inside..
