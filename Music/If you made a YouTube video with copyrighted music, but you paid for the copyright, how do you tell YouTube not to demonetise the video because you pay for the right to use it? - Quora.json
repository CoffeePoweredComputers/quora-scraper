            "answer_text": "All (almost) of the audio and video on YouTube is copyrighted. You hold the copyright on all your original content, for instance. YouTube has no rules against using copyrighted content. You probably did not purchase the copyrights to another person\u2019s work, but rather you paid to receive a license (permission) to use a copy of the work. That license will grant you permission to use the work with certain limits. For example, presumably you obtained a license that contains language that explicitly gives you permission to use it in YouTube videos. For a lots of commercial music, sometimes there are a multiple licenses required (permission to use the music, permission to sync it to music, permission to use the lyrics), and sometimes these are bundled together. YouTube has a system that compares audio from uploads to a library of audio fingerprints uploaded by copyright holders. If it find a match, it sends a notification to the copyright holder and to the user to inform both parties that a match was found, and the copyright holder has 30 days to decide how they\u2019d like to proceed. The possible infringer is also given the opportunity to respond. One of the options is to claim that you have a license to use the music. Most places will give you a reference number or code for the license, and if you use it in your response, the claim will be cleared. Smaller outfits won\u2019t, and you need to put a simple statement like \u201cI licensed use of the work for $X from Y (somebody@somewhere.net) for use on YouTube\u201d, and if they do not refute it, the claim is dropped. I once had an artist that released a work under creative commons attribution who later released a derivative work not under Creative Commons. YouTube detected the former as the latter, and I simply responded, I have a license to use the work under creative commons and provided a link to the page where I downloaded the work from. That cleared everything up. ",

            "answer_text": "When you are hit with the copyright strike or copyright claim, you appeal that action on the video\u2019s edit page. In that appeal, you send them the paperwork that shows you have permission to use that music. Can I clear up something though? \u201c\u2026you paid for the copyright\u201d isn\u2019t a thing. Hopefully you mean, \u201cI paid for a use license from the owner of the copyright.\u201d Because no one sells their copyright to someone else. That\u2019s not how musicians use their own music. When you are appealing your copyright strike/claim, you send them your use license, which should be a contract explaining exactly what the rules are for your use. Hopefully you don\u2019t mean that you bought the music on iTunes or on a CD. Because paying so you can listen to the music is NOT a use license that allows redistribution. ",
