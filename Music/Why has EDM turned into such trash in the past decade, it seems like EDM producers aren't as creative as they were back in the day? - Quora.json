            "answer_text": "I hear this question all the time and I cannot figure wtf people are talking about. EDM has never been more alive, accessible and unique. The answer is, You are just listening to the wrong artists. If all you listen to is David Guetta, ghost-produced Tiesto, Afro Jack, Steve Aoki and the plathora of other mainstream \u2018DJs\u2019 then yeah I agree. It\u2019s all trash that has been done a thousand times. You have to dig deep into the underground scene and see the beautiful music that people are creating. Like Porter Robinson, Seven Lions, Illenium, San holo, TroyBoi, Droeleo (this dude is so creative!), autograf, Odesza (Have you heard Odesza??), Said the Sky, Mako, Jaymes Young, ARIZONA, Armnhmr, Momes, Kungs, blackbear, Zhu, The Him, MitiS, Tchami, BUNT., graves, Away (if you want creative..AWAY!!), William Black, Ella Vos, Alina Baraz, Emmit Fenn, Echos (Echos is phenomenal), Ameria, Lauv, Seeb, Duke Dumont, Skott, Sublab, Grey, And there\u2019s plenty more. As for why are they not as creative as before..well the producers \u2018back in the day\u2019 were inventing the genre from nothing. And all the technology was just coming out in those years. So it seems as if those producers were more creative but it was just good timing for them. And now it\u2019s even more difficult because so much has been done already. People say the same thing about HipHop and it\u2019s far more true for Hip Hop, as that scene as crumbled into nothing but total garbage. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm far from a fan of EDM, I can answer the last question. It's hard to be creative when almost everything that can be done, has been done. The same issue plagues almost everything creative, and will never not be an issue. That aside, there are select few EDM artists who I enjoyed, and can say helped me a good bit when I sunk into thinking some dark things. Stan SB (now known as Fox Stevenson) has a song named \u201cDead\u201d which, to this day, I adore.Tristam has less songs I'd personally listen to, but \u201cFrame of Mind\u201d was one if my favorites for a while.Marshmello (real surprise, I know), in general I just find his stuff pleasant.You can find good music in any genre, you just gotta look hard enough.
