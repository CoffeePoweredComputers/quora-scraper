Quite hard to define what is EXO's Thunder, but I think also pop, just with a lot of sfx samples (like breaking glass sound). ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, all of these are pop songs. They can pretty much all be considered Kpop, also, but some of the songs are sung in other languages. Replay by SHINee is sung in Korean as well as Japanese. Most, if not all, of EXO's music is also done in Mandarin. DBSK, when they were around, sung in Japanese and Mandarin if I'm not mistaken. I don't know them well enough to know which songs were sung in what. The rest of the groups and people on the list sing in Korean, or at least the ones that I recognize.  TL;DR the list contains Kpop, Jpop, and Mandpop as far as I know. ",
