            "answer_text": "Well, I dunno why it is for you, but, I could give you my POV: Instrumental music or music with just not much text does have a habit of not forcing a meaning unto you and instead you can add your own, typically derived of a situation you heard the specific track in or just a specific feeling/mood you had when first listening it. Music as a whole has a habit of \"triggering\" memorys. Also, the songs you linked in the description are both from Soundtracks--the first a remix, mind you, still--so, you might just get emotional because they remind you of the emotional parts of whatever the songs come from... Haven't watched Cowboy Bebop--never sounded like something I'd care for--but I do have played Undertale, so, with the remix of Bergentr\u00fcckung it very specifically could be because the moment the track plays is rather emotional--I mean, I remember sitting there, staring at the display, having no clue what to do as the game just fucked me over and I genuinely didn't want to hurt that stupid goat, and I am known in real life to be stoic to the point of appearing emotionless--so, that might just be a memory floating into you via the music triggering the emotions of that moment. That and thirdly, art as a whole as about the closest, if highly imperfect, means of communicating emotion we have--as in sharing the emotions with others, not just informing them about them... ...and of pretty much all the forms of art, music seems to be the most visceral and direct way to do so. Guess communicating with you is just somewhat easy--as far as \"easy\" is a word even useable in this context--in that regard. Lastly, you simply could be a rather emotional person. ",

            "answer_text": "Because, this is what music does: It appeals to our emotions. Music conveys emotions. Music engenders emotions. Music sustains and augments some emotions while lessening certain others. Ever tried having a heated argument with Yakety Sax going on in the background? Yeah, it can't really be carried out. Because that certain track augments and appeals to our light-hearted, happy emotions. You probably wouldn't have great success in making tender love with Magrudergrind as a musical backdrop, because that kind of music appeals to our hostile, nihilistic emotions. If you get too emotionally carried away by listening to instrumental and light vocal music, try pushing your preferences in other directions. There are worlds of music out there, waiting to be discovered. And no matter what you're into, there's always gonna be something related that you're gonna like as well. Keep an open mind. ",
