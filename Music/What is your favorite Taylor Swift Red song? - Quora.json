            "answer_text": "I want to say All too well but that would be unfair to rest of her songs\u2026cuz every song in the album has got it's own meaning and feeling and it's pointless to pick a favourite outta them. It all depends on my mood\u2026 when I'm happy I prefer listening stay stay stay, starlight, holyground or may be 22. And when I'm in not-so-good mood I usually play sad beautiful tragic, treacherous, or I almost do. Well, these days I keep playing state of grace (acoustic version ) on repeat\u2026 so deep and calm. It's melody works like a lulaby to me. It's like she's singing live\u2026 that too in my ears!!  P.S. This is my version of state of grace. I sang this on smule sing quite a while ago and it's nothing like hers version\u2026 but I did my best!! ^_^ State of grace acoustic on Sing! Karaoke | Smule ",
