No need to try and push your studio time to breaking point, not when so much is done inside the computers. Turn up, record and release. But\u2026. Who released singles without including them on their albums? The Rutles. Whoops. The Beatles. It\u2019s not a new thing at all. An album was either a collection of singles or a collection of new music. Like a photo album is a collection of photos. There may be a concept, a theme, a thought out running order. Some bands might have treated the single as priority, some the album. And that\u2019s not changed. Some artists look to the singles, others the album. Newer artists might not even have an albums worth of material. Others may already have hundreds of songs. Some may hate the idea of albums, others have sketched out the gatefold. ",

            "answer_text": "I think these things go in cycles. Also, genre of music has to do with how it\u2019s marketed. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, there was certainly a focus on singles. There were certainly albums of note (think Revolver or Pet Sounds, just to name a couple). As someone mentioned, the Beatles released singles not on original albums, but Honky Tonk Women never appeared on an original Rolling Stones album. By the 1970s, many rock bands considered an album to be a musical statement as a whole, made to be listened to in one sitting. Prog Rock brought this to a whole new level. Consider this: Stairway to Heaven was never released as a single. By the time the 1990s came around, a $20 compact disc had to be purchased by some people who maybe were only interested in one or two songs. It was rare that an album had several hits. Margins were much larger. ",
