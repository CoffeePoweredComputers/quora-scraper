            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for the request. Personally i love all BTS rap lines song. I love rap so much and for me all of their rap songs have unique and special style in it. But to choose the ultimate one is \ub561 aka Ddaeng. This song is very goooooooooddddddddddddddddd. It was produced by J-Pearl along side our beautiful Raplines. The first reason on why i love this song is because of the way they include traditional music in that magnificent song. That is a brilliant idea in letting people know that you are proud of your origin and are proving that you are not being westernised. Secondly, i love the way they express their thoughts about the haters and how grateful they are for their presence. The skill in rapping also was very good as you can see how Namjoon (RM) rap by stuttering without flaws and that my friend is called a good freaking skilled rap. Last but not least, I admire the way they used the word \ub561 to express all the discrimination and negativity they have faced until now. Ddaeng means wrong or incorrect in korean. As you can see in Hoseok\u2019s (J-Hope)line Hip-hop? ddaengRap style? ddaengJust rapper, ddaengBangtan = ddaengBut reality, bangWorldwide, bangAbove chart bang bang, ddaeng This lyrics is telling us how people react to them right after their debut. All the criticism they faced just because of their passion. BTS debuted as a hip hop group which is something rare under kpop and them majoring in rapping is something not normal so they received so many backlash and some were even telling that they will not make it to the end. It really amazes me to see the way they respond to it in such a cool way. For those who never heard this song, go and check it out cause you are missing a bop. Hope this is enough :) \u1104\u1162\u11bc - RM, SUGA, J-HOPE ",

            "answer_text": " UGH! This song has to be one of the best tracks on Map of The Soul: 7. They weren\u2019t kidding around when they were making this album. The gunshot in the beginning only gets you ready for the hype in this song. It really helps you catch your attention in the beginning. The rap line was unbelievably fast and strong and this song really just flexes how good they are at rapping. Suga\u2019s raspy and frustrated voice fits so well with the song Hobi\u2019s part has got to be the best part. It was so cool when he got gradually angrier and angrier. He really wasn\u2019t kidding. When one member was rapping, another would add sound effects in the background and it mixed in together so well. Namjoon has the strongest voice in BTS so you would imagine how good he would sound in an equally strong song. The lyrics were also so smart. When it starts to bite, boom boom boom It becomes the neighborhood drum, boom boom boom Rage? Of course you need it When it burns up there's always a reason Which one is rage, you know? Pretending it's rage and killing, real rage Fed up, the countless number of people You\u2019re not just killing me (you're not) We\u2019re used to stepping on sh*t (we are) This world, it is taken over by rage It seems that nobody can live without rage Raging, again raging, and raging Going insane, like UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH! There are tens of thousands of reasons to be raging This song is just the purest form of anger Lesson from this: don\u2019t underestimate the rap line. ",
