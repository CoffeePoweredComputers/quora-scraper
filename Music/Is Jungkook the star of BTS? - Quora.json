They work all of their asses off, but no one can see that. Doesn't mean Jungkook is the main vocalist does not mean he is the star of the show (questions like these literally break up bands). Don\u2019t get me wrong he is talented but so are all of them. I don\u2019t know where you gotten the idea that JK is \u201cthe star\u201d but I\u2019m shutting that down. Like what if your in a band and some idiot asks if one of the member is the star. I don\u2019t no where your from, but that is called being offensive. So chill the hell out with these questions. So Jungkook is not the star. (Do you ever wonder maybe BTS will read this question) ~Elise \u270c ",
