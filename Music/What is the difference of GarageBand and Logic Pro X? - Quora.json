            "answer_text": "The main differences are in fine-grained control, and some pretty important basics missing from GB. Not knowing anything about you, I\u2019ll just say that if you have a moderate amount of experience, and certainly if you\u2019ve ever worked, even casually, at a studio console- you wouldn\u2019t be happy with GarageBand. On the other hand, if you are a beginner, and/or doing very simple recordings, GB may be just what you need. The biggest things which kept me from playing with GB are the lack of aux sends/returns, no effects on the main outs, and the lack of detailed audio or MIDI editing (compared Logic or Cubase and the like). So (forgive me if I\u2019m telling you things you already know), in GB you can\u2019t have a \u201cdrum buss\u201d. You can\u2019t use a send for reverb on 3 (or whatever) background vocal tracks. You can\u2019t do relative operations on MIDI data. Most of the plugins (instruments and processing) in GB are watered-down versions- like dynamics, which is pretty important to me. If you don\u2019t know what any of that is, and just want to record yourself singing and playing guitar, then GB is fine. I can\u2019t remember if you can edit an audio file at all, but if you can, it\u2019s nothing like in Logic. One good thing about GB is that since it supports AU plugins, a $200 plugin will run in Logic or GB, and GB costs less, if money is a primary concern, but you still want, for example, a really nice compressor. Lastly, (I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots others can add) with my audio interface, I can record 16 tracks at once (sounds like a lot, but if you record a band, you need at least 4 for the drums alone). I\u2019m pretty sure GB only supports 8 simultaneously. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are serious about making music, whether as a hobby or a career, it\u2019s time to pick up Logic Pro. Garageband is easy and fun but it\u2019s incredibly limited in what it can do. One thing to keep in mind is that any serious recording software is going to have a bit of a learning curve. You may install the software, open it up, and have absolutely no clue where to start. That\u2019s okay, any recording software (a.k.a. Digital Audio Workstation, a.k.a. DAW) is going to take some getting used to. There are a TON of resources on the internet that will teach you how to use Logic Pro X and many of them are free. I say go ahead and get Logic Pro! ",
