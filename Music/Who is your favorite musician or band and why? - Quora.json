            "answer_text": "Awesome question! Not as easy as it seems either, so here it goes\u2026 10. Metallica- Though they\u2019ve faltered a bit during the latter stages of their career, they are the band that really ignited my passion for music way back in \u201988 or \u201889, when I was just a wee little kid looking for my own sound to love. Their run of albums from their debut Kill \u2019Em All up through their self-titled \u201cBlack Album,\u201d is legendary, and they deserve a top-ten spot. 9. Pantera- Hearing Pantera the first time was like a punch in the gut; they were so good, and so heavy, that it hurt. I instantly recognized that my childhood heroes Metallica had a fight on their hands, and this came to a head when I saw Pantera in \u201896, and Phil Anselmo had the crowd cheering \u201cMetallica sucks\u201d after voicing his displeasure with the direction they were heading in following the release of Load. I still feel guilty about joining in on that chant, but Pantera were definitely the new kings of the metal scene as they proclaimed. In many ways, I still consider them to be the heaviest to ever do the damn thing. Absolute metal legends. 8. Behemoth- It took me a real long time to get into death-metal, mainly because I found it hard to tolerate the \u201ccookie-monster\u201d vocal approach of many bands in the genre. What I finally realized, however, was that I was missing out on some insanely talented and technical musicians, and once I fully grasped this, the vocals not only didn\u2019t bother me any more, but they truly added to the aesthetic of the music. Poland\u2019s Behemoth is one of the heaviest bands I\u2019ve ever heard, with an unwavering love for everything Satanic, and over the past few years they\u2019ve really gotten some well-deserved recognition for their hard work, spanning nearly 30 years now. The album Evangelion is blackened-death metal perfection, and heavy as hell. The albums The Satanist and I Loved You at Your Darkest are a bit more accessible if you want to check this group out, but I love all their material, and if you\u2019re at all a fan of the genre, or merely intrepid of extreme music, you will too. 7. Death- The pioneers of the genre that bears their name, Death is the band that personally got me into this style of music. I had plenty of experience with other extreme bands that were sometimes categorized as death-metal, or at least used elements of the style. But when I first listened to Death\u2019s debut album, Scream Bloody Gore, I immediately recognized the elements that constituted \u201cdeath-metal,\u201d and that made their debut the first quintessential album of the genre. I listened to this album with the sole intention of getting what it meant to the history of the genre, and I really wanted to embrace this and have a sound foundation of understanding them and their contributions. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Death is masterful, and one thing that really stands out to me about them is the progression and the maturity that they went through with each and every release. Musically, lyrically, and conceptually every record exponentially expands upon its predecessor, culminating in their final disc (before lead guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s untimely death), 1998\u2019s The Sound of Perseverance. Boasting some of the baddest musicians in metal including bassist Steve DiGiorgio and drummer Gene Hoglan, not to mention Chuck himself, Death shouldn\u2019t be missed by fans of technical, extreme music. Sheer brilliance. 6. Bluetech & Spunkshine- Ok, so by including two acts here I recognize that I may be cheating a bit, but since these two artists are among the very few electronica artists that I listen to, and they\u2019re both phenomenal, they both get a nod here. It\u2019s also difficult for me to say that I like one over the other, as they both have such different approaches to their craft. Bluetech\u2019s electronic music is transcendent, often taking me to other internal worlds and dimensions, with lush, multi-layered and textured songs that beg to be repeated and re-explored. I can say with certainty that every time I listen to Bluetech, if I\u2019m really paying attention, I will discover something new each time, maybe a bleep or a bloop that I didn\u2019t hear before, or a pattern that perhaps eluded me on previous listens. Spunkshine, on the other hand, is a little more straight forward, but no less impressive. While his music can still transport you to other inner landscapes similar to Bluetech, it also can be way more lighthearted, at times having more of a party atmosphere to it, and a certain, undeniably charming sense of humor as well. I actually surprised myself by including these artists so high on my list, but since I listen almost exclusively to them while I read (and I read quite a bit), they are more than deserving of a spot based on the sheer volume of their music that I consume. It also helps that they are highly skilled, and deft in their craft. Don\u2019t pass them up. 5. Pink Floyd- My father\u2019s favorite group, some of my earliest music memories include Pink Floyd\u2019s timeless tunes. I remember vividly the joy my Dad got (and still gets) from listening to Pink Floyd, and I knew they were something special. They also sounded completely different from anything that I was hearing on the radio at the time, so they always had an air of mystery to me. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I discovered just how deep their discography ran, and how varied their music had been. I was used to hearing Wish You Were Here and Dark Side of the Moon, but I had no idea about earlier work such as Meddle or Atom Heart Mother, two albums that my best-friend and I became very familiar with, as they often played as the soundtrack during nights when we were experimenting with the different states of our consciousness. Pink Floyd is simply a legendary rock band, and their music to me still remains to be among the most emotion inducing, mind-bending, and thought provoking I\u2019ve ever heard. David Gilmour\u2019s soaring, squeaky clean play style is instantly recognizable, as are Roger Waters\u2019 thematic veins that run through his songs. Floyd\u2019s music may be pushing the 60 year mark by the middle of this decade, but they will always be timeless to me, and millions of others. For the longest time they were my favorite group to emerge from an era before my time, but as I\u2019ve gotten older one band as usurped them in this regard\u2026 4. Rush- Before I really got into Rush, I had heard their radio hits somewhat frequently. I was familiar with \u201cTom Sawyer,\u201d \u201cLimelight,\u201d \u201cSubdivisions,\u201d and \u201cThe Spirit of Radio,\u201d and while I thought they were pretty cool, I wasn\u2019t exactly blown away by them. The first time I thought Rush could be a band I really liked, I had heard \u201cYYZ\u201d at a job I had doing warehouse work. \u201cThis is pretty cool,\u201d I said to my boss at the time, who was about 10 years my senior. \u201cWho is this?\u201d \u201cWho is this?\u201d he replied, apparently offended that I didn\u2019t know. \u201cThis is Rush, man.\u201d After I admitted my admiration for the song, he proceeded to \u201cschool\u201d me on how awesome they were, citing many songs off their classic album, Moving Pictures, strongly recommending that I check them out. This was in 2006 or so, so I started looking for some of their music on iTunes, but I didn\u2019t really know where to start, and I wasn\u2019t yet ready to fully appreciate their awesomeness, so whatever I found didn\u2019t overly impress me. Then about four or five years later, now working for the U.S. Post Office, a coworker (also older than me by about a decade) told me I must listen to the album 2112, that I was sure to love it, and never look back. So, I ordered the CD through the mail on his glowing endorsement, and when I got it, I was impressed, but again, it didn\u2019t fully grab me. It was cool, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I simply wasn\u2019t there yet. But then I watched the documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, and I found it so compelling that I decided to try once more to find something that really spoke to me. I went back to iTunes, and downloaded the album Hemispheres. Cautiously optimistic, I put some headphones on and lay down, ready to give this album my full attention to see if this was the one to bring me into the fold. And holy smokes, did it ever. I was instantly hooked. This was the record I\u2019d been waiting for, the one that made me look at, what I knew was a beloved band, and deservedly so, with new eyes. Everything about this album jumped out at me: the time signature shifts, the knotty, intelligent compositions, the lyricism, and above all, the sheer joy of the musicians themselves. This to me was an album that you could just tell they loved writing, and adored executing. Every song on this record just oozes with craftsmanship, virtuosity, and unbridled passion. To this day this album is my favorite work by Rush, though that margin has certainly gotten tighter as I explored the rest of their discography, and expanded my appreciation and understanding of who they are and what they do. I love almost everything they\u2019ve done, with really only one album out of their nineteen that didn\u2019t do much for me (that album being 1987\u2019s Hold Your Fire; I appreciate them embracing the times, but it just sounds too light to me, though it still has some good tunes). When we got news of Neil \u201cThe Professor\u201d Peart\u2019s passing last week, I actually shed some tears, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done for any other musician. His legacy as one of the greatest drummers of all time is undeniable, and his mastery of the English language in his lyrics cannot be overstated. The man was simply a genius. Perhaps Rush being a three piece added to the magnitude of his passing; being retired since 2015 is one thing; passing is finality. It really hit me hard to contemplate that this band, ranked third behind only The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in terms of albums sold, was no more. I could only imagine what his band mates and brothers, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, must feel. Thankfully, we have nineteen studio albums, and many live albums and documentaries to indulge in, so this unrivaled, prolific group will live forever through their incredible body of work. If you\u2019ve not yet really delved into the magic that is Rush, stop reading this list and go check out ALL of their work. They are inimitable. 3. Tool- Like many bands on this list, my relationship with Tool was not love at first listen. My introduction to them was the music video for 1993\u2019s break through song, Sober, and the creepy, clay-mation visuals combined with the dark, brooding song definitely got me interested in them. But when I borrowed the CD from a friend at school, I felt a bit disappointed. It seemed Undertow underwhelmed me. Three years later I decided to give them another shot, and without hearing anything off of their latest release, Aenima, I decided to purchase it. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this album. From front to back, this disc was weird in the best of ways, with some really brilliant songs on it. \u201cStinkfist,\u201d \u201c46 & 2,\u201d and the title track were early standouts, proven by their rotation on radio stations at the time. But what I really loved about this disc, were the longer, proggy epic tracks like \u201cEulogy,\u201d \u201cPushit,\u201d and \u201cThird Eye.\u201d These songs made me look at this band like my generation\u2019s Pink Floyd, a connection that I still see today, and that has only strengthened with each successive release. By the time 2001\u2019s Lateralus came out, I was a full-fledged Tool fan, and this album was the first one that I really anticipated by them. And much to my satisfaction, the album turned out to be an awe-inspiring masterpiece, boasting some of their finest musicianship to date, incredibly spiritual concepts, and consciousness expanding artwork by psychedelic artist, the brilliant Alex Grey. Seriously, this album is something very special, not just by Tool, but in the history of music, period. Not before, nor since, have I really seen or heard an album that approaches holy realms as much as Tool\u2019s Lateralus. The jaw-dropping artwork, beautiful lyrics, and universal human concepts all combine to create such a complete, cohesive piece of art, that in its totality, it has become my favorite work of art. It\u2019s music, but it transcends music and approaches something so much bigger, so much deeper, that words like \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201choly\u201d are the only adjectives appropriate to describe it. Favoring quality over quantity, we\u2019ve only seen two releases by the alt-metal group since 2006: that year\u2019s wonderful 10,000 Days, and 2019\u2019s triumphant return record, Fear Inoculum, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts despite having exactly one song under the 10-minute mark. It seems Tool still has the capacity to demand attention, 30 years into their career. If you\u2019re not familiar with their work, jump on board, because there\u2019s no one quite like these guys, and their brand of poly-rhythmic, primal perfection. 2. Faith No More- When I first heard the song \u201cEpic\u201d way back in 1989 in it\u2019s music video on MTV, I fell in love with this genre-defying band immediately. I actually thought that I was a fan of rap thanks to them, because no other singer that I had been listening to at the time came close to what vocalist extraordinaire, Mike Patton, was doing on this track. Sure, he sang the chorus in his young, nasally voice, but the verses were spit like bars from MC Hammer or something. I was a bit confused, but also highly intrigued, and for Christmas that year I requested, and received, Faith No More\u2019s breakthrough album, the brilliant The Real Thing. The rest of the record proved to be every bit as much of an enigma as \u201cEpic,\u201d shifting from alt-rock (\u201cFrom Out of Nowhere\u201d and \u201cFalling to Pieces\u201d), to rap-rock (\u201cEpic), from lounge music (\u201cEdge of the World\u201d) to straight heavy metal (\u201cSurprise! You\u2019re Dead!\u201d). It had bizarre tunes (\u201cZombie Eaters\u201d and \u201cWoodpecker From Mars\u201d), and a touch of progressive rock (\u201cThe Real Thing\u201d). It moved in many different, diverse directions, and I loved every single one of them. They even covered Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cWar Pigs,\u201d and when my father heard it he told me about Sabbath, and I was delighted to have another musical connection with him that we could share. As a young hard-rock and metal fan, Faith No More\u2019s The Real Thing taught me that I could appreciate music outside of whatever my \u201cnormal\u201d parameters were, which turned out to be an extremely valuable lesson to me not only in the music world, but as a metaphor for life, too. It taught me greatly not to care what other people thought; if I liked something, I could like it without fearing rejection or ridicule or whatever. My grandfather used to say, \u201cto thine own self be true.\u201d I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Faith No More used their inimitable approach to music to teach me the same lesson. My love of this band also stems from the fact that they are the first group I feel I really discovered on my own, and I looked at them as \u201cmy band.\u201d My Dad introduced me to Pink Floyd, my uncle to Metallica, my older cousins to Guns \u2019N Roses. But I found Faith No More. Or perhaps more accurately, they found me. After the huge commercial success of The Real Thing, FNM returned with the highly anticipated follow-up, 1992\u2019s Angel Dust. Talk about an album that is next to impossible to describe. Any hopes of a continuation of the sound of The Real Thing were quickly dashed, save for the undeniable weirdness that was part of their trademark. This album had metal influences, country influences, industrial influences, Asian influences, and others that I\u2019m probably not hip enough to fully grasp. At the time, critics dubbed the album \u201ccommercial suicide.\u201d Clearly FNM didn\u2019t care; they created the record they wanted to create, and remained true to their art and their vision. How can you not respect that about a band? Faith No More\u2019s discography is immaculate, going all the way back to We Care a Lot up through 2015\u2019s surprise reunion record, Sol Invictus, an album that released 18 years after it\u2019s predecessor, the humorously, yet accurate titled Album of the Year. They really haven\u2019t released a bad record. If you\u2019re not acquainted with this brilliant band, do yourself a favor, and change that. They have one of the best rhythm sections of the last 30 plus years, and Mike Patton is a true genius, and highly critically acclaimed vocalist with incredible range, and a rich, deep croon sure to give you the feels every time he belts out their awesome tracks. FNM are a must listen. Honorable Mentions: Before we take a look at No. 1, lets name a few bands that are right there, and sometimes may even rotate in and out of the Top 10 at times, depending on my mood. Iron Maiden, Between the Buried and Me, Gojira, Lamb of God, Black Sabbath, Mastodon, Radiohead, Baroness, Giant Squid. Number 1. Meshuggah- Of all the bands I\u2019ve listed so far, and all of the hundreds and probably thousands of times that I\u2019ve spun their records, probably none have been played as frequently, or intensely, as the \u201cdjent\u201d Godfathers themselves, Sweden\u2019s uncompromisingly heavy and heady, Meshuggah. Together now for over 30 years, Meshuggah is a group that must be listened to to believe. The complexity of their music, the concepts and themes of their lyrics, and the execution of their incredibly groovy and relentlessly heavy songs, Meshuggah have carved out a path in the heavy metal landscape that only a few have attempted to follow, and none of been able to mimic. When I first heard them over 20 years ago, a musician friend of mine gave me their breakthrough album, the awesome, jazz infused, technical metal masterpiece, Destroy Erase Improve. Again, like Rush mentioned earlier, I could recognize their talent, but I just didn\u2019t get it. I was too into Pantera and Sepultura and Metallica, and this disc just seemed a bit, advanced for my tastes, and I justified this because my friend was a musician, which I was not yet. I figured he just knew better than I what the hell it was that this band was doing. I passed them up. Somewhere around 2005, I heard the song \u201cFuture Breed Machine\u201d again, and I dug it so much that I went out and finally bought Destroy Erase Improve. If I played it 10 times, that was a lot, because I still wasn\u2019t ready to fully grasp their brand of metal, and I put the CD back on my shelf, unsure if I was ever really going to get into this band. Same thing happened a year later when they re-released their incredible album, Nothing, this time re-recorded with 8-string guitars instead of 7-string guitars. I was intrigued about this, and I had read interviews about how this re-release was how they always envisioned the album, but there were no 8-string guitars back in 2002 when the album was originally released. The band was so far ahead of its time, the technology hadn\u2019t yet caught up to their vision. That should tell you something. The first thing I noticed when I played the album, was the tone of the guitars; they were absolutely guttural. By this time I was already into bands like Mastodon and Lamb of God, but I hadn\u2019t heard anything quite as heavy as this record yet. Even so, the compositions and the arrangements of the songs were such that, I just couldn\u2019t decipher what they were doing. Meshuggah operate more on the percussive side of things, with very little melody to speak of in their entire catalog, so all of these songs, to my ears, kind of just sounded the same. The only thing I could really differentiate from anything else, was the last few minutes of the track \u201cStraws Pulled at Random,\u201d which is probably the most melody they\u2019ve ever used before or since. Once again, my attempt to break into Meshuggah\u2019s mystery was thwarted. The next album that I came across was also given to me by a buddy, the massively ambitious Catch Thirtythr33, one, continuous song broken into movements over 13 tracks. If I didn\u2019t get Nothing initially, I didn\u2019t stand too good a chance at getting this one either. Without really giving it a fair chance, I listened to it once, maybe twice, and returned the CD to my friend. It seemed that Meshuggah just wasn\u2019t for me, but I knew there was something there, if I could only figure out what it was. They were so critically acclaimed, I felt the fault of not getting them was squarely on my shoulders. Then, in March 2008, Meshuggah unleashed obZen on the world. Here was another chance for me to figure out this elusive, metal machine that everyone in the metal world was talking about. I kept hearing about the song \u201cBleed,\u201d and what a thrilling piece of extreme music it was. I reluctantly drove myself up to Best Buy to purchase what would be my third Meshuggah album, and I figured if it didn\u2019t grab me, it would probably be my last. This album didn\u2019t just grab me; it wrapped its mechanical, maniacal hands around my throat, lifted me off the ground, and shook me till I nearly shit myself. Yeah, it was like that. The opening track \u201cCombustion\u201d came roaring through my speakers like every beloved thrash song I ever heard, except this one was coked-up, on steroids, and drunk on Red Bull. It was fast, ferocious, and filthy heavy. The next track, \u201cElectric Red\u201d slowed things down a bit, and actually upped the heaviness as a result. And it included a syncopated middle section that blew my mind then, and continues to do so with every single listen since. The last groove they go out on in that song is pure, groove-metal bliss. Then \u201cBleed\u201d came on, the song everyone was raving about, and it was immediately apparent as to why. I\u2019m not even going to attempt to put into words the sound of this song, but I remember thinking when I heard it, \u201cwhen is Tomas Haake gonna let up on that bass drum?\u201d (Hint: he doesn\u2019t). Withing the first 12 or 13 minutes of this album, I was converted to a full-fledged fan of a band I simply didn\u2019t get just a few short months before. I now had to re-listen to all of the other albums I owned from them. I now had to buy all the albums from them that I didn\u2019t already own. I now had to go see them live first chance I got. Meshuggah actually ruined me for anything that wasn\u2019t Meshuggah for about two or three years; everything else I listened to just sounded so simplistic, and I felt like nothing was challenging enough to demand my attention. Looking back, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly a good thing, but I really felt I had no choice. Meshuggah were just so cerebral, that they felt like the only band worthy of my time and mind. I have since let go of my obsession with them, but I still listen to them rather frequently. More importantly, while they were not the first extreme band I listened to, they certainly are the most influential to me. Thanks to Meshuggah, I have the courage and confidence to go into every encounter with new, extreme music, hopeful and fairly certain that I will find something of value. And that\u2019s a great gift to receive from any band. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this group. If you\u2019ve never heard them, strap in; you\u2019re in for a wild, unflinchingly heavy, psychedelically tinged journey to musical realms you\u2019ve probably never embarked on before. Every album of theirs is incredible, and I\u2019m never at a loss of awe for how many patterns they are capable of coming up with within the framework of their familiar sound. Check them out, but be wary, and be patient. You might not get it at first, but when everything clicks, oh what a glorious kick in the teeth it is. So there you have it. If you\u2019ve stuck with me for this long, wow! Thank you, thank you, thank you for your time. I realize this is really long, and I hope you recognize the passion with which I came up with this list. I could talk or write about music forever, it truly is one of my greatest joys in life. Beyond anything, for those of you who\u2019ve got this far, I hope I\u2019ve given you something of value here, and maybe piqued your curiosity enough to go scope these bands out. Many are on the extreme side of things, but from a musical standpoint, they are very intricate, cerebral, and, ultimately, rewarding. Music of course is subjective, and we can\u2019t all like the same things, but I think this list contains some real \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d bands on it, and if you spend some time with any or all of them, I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll agree. Cheers, and happy listening! -Mike ",

            "answer_text": "Ben HowardI have a rule when it comes to music; it has to be good enough to make a grown, battle hardened man cry. I also tend to favor very atmospheric, lush, moody music. The kind that you can listen to on a rainy day while sipping a hot cup of tea and just staring at the rain or your loved one. Ben Howard makes music like that but on PURE OPIUM. It\u2019s really hard to describe his music but I will say that you can tell that every note is crafted with the utmost amount of care and thought. Ben Howard is most likely your favorite musicians favorite musician. He\u2019s that incredible. My favorite songs by him are \u2018\u2018Small Things\u201d \u201cThe Fear\u201d \u201cI Forget Where We Were\u201d and \u201cShe Treats Me Well\u201d 2. Bear\u2019s Den Speaking of lush and atmospheric but with a little more energy, these guys had the most incredible concert I\u2019d ever witnessed. Their music is kind of like driving down a highway while watching the most beautiful sun set in front of you as you think about the great life your friend lived because YOU JUST CAME FROM HIS FUNERAL. It\u2019s a great mixture of texture, color, melancholy, and energy that I\u2019ve never really heard in a band before. My favorite songs by them are \u201cGreenwood\u2019s Bethlehem\u201d \u201cSophie\u201d \u201cA Year Ago Today\u201d and \u201cRed Earth and Pouring Rain\u201d 3. The National Speaking of melancholy, if you are into moody, mournful type music, then this band is for you. Another male led band, their music is beautiful and perfect for getting you into your feelings. My favorite songs by them are \u201cCarin At The Liquor Store\u201d \u201cI Need My Girl\u201d and \u201cStart A War\u201d 4. Daughter Oh man. If you\u2019re listening to daughter, then you\u2019re just begging for a weeping session. Their music is slow, soft, atmospheric, and tortured. A great glimpse into the shy and quiet soul of the female lead singer. My favorite songs by them are \u201cLove\u201d \u201cSmother\u201d \u201cMedicine\u201d and \u201cLandfill\u201d 5. Birdy Birdy is somewhat of an outlier for me because she\u2019s gradually making her way towards pop but her pop is different. It\u2019s more meaningful, encouraging, and in my opinion, better crafted. My favorite songs by her are \u201cWhite Winter Hymnal\u201d \u201cYoung Blood\u201d \u201cPeople Help The People\u201d and \u201cWild Horses\u201d 6. Magic Man Now for some uptempo stuff! Magic man is my go to work out music. Fun, high energy music that you can just dance to. My favorite songs by them are \u201cParis\u201d \u201cChicagoland\u201d and \u201cEvery Day\u201d 7. Noah Gundersen Thought the uptempo stuff was going to last didn\u2019t you? Sorry to disappoint but Noah Gundersen doesn\u2019t care that you want to dance. His music is deep, lush, and pain-filled. Lots of heartbreak here. My favorite songs by him are \u201cDay Is Gone\u201d \u201cLedges\u201d \u201cGarden\u201d and \u201cFamily\u201d 8. Trevor Hall Trevor Hall makes music for the beach hippie in me. The kind that likes to spend my days surfing (I really don\u2019t surf tho) in Hawaii and my night staring at the ocean pondering the existence of things/ chanting hakas with my indigenous Hawaiian people. My favorite songs by him are \u201cOrigami Crane\u201d \u201cParachutes\u201d \u201c The Return\u201d \u201cVolume\u201d and \u201cWell I Say\u201d 9. Mree Music Mree Music is the definition of lush and atmospheric. Almost all of her songs remind you of a barren winter landscape so quiet you could hear the snows fall. My favorite songs by her are \u201cThe Search\u201d \u201c Of The Trees\u201d and \u201cMonster\u201d 10. The Helio Sequence When you hear this band\u2019s music for the first time, you\u2019d be shocked to learn they are only composed of two people. They\u2019ve been able to find that elusive middle ground between big power anthems similar to Imagine Dragons and soft intimate music in the vein of Bon Iver. My favorite songs by them are \u201cHallelujah\u201d \u201cDownward Spiral\u201d \u201cOctober\u201d and my all time favorite by them \u201cShed Your Love\u201d Honorable Mentions Gabrielle Aplin - \u201cHome\u201d \u201cRomeo Must Die\u201d \u201cOut On My Own\u201d \u201cWaking Up Slow - Piano\u201d Illenium - \u201cWith you\u201d \u201cReverie\u201d ",
