            "answer_text": "There are much easier ways to make money. If you don't trend towards the type of personality who already begged their parents for a guitar/piano/trombone/whatever and practices every day without being told simply because you want to be the best, then music as a career probably isn't for you. If you're not easily first chair or improving rapidly and on your way, or if you feel like you're stuck on the same problems every lesson (if you're taking lessons, which you should be), then music is probably not for you. There are an enormous amount of musicians with Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees pumped out by our University system every year. 3000-ish, if I remember correctly. Not all of them are in direct competition with you, but of course, cumulatively, for any given job you'll be competing against at least 100\u2013500 other guys/gals who are just as qualified, talented, and maybe better looking than you (not that that should matter but it sometimes does, unfortunately). And that's just classically/jazz trained musicians. If you're talking about the pop/rock industry, good luck, because unless you've been training as hard as classical musicians do, have an absurdly unique voice, or know the right people/are rich already, you'll be hustling and hustling from one bar to the next for years, maybe decades before you \u201cbreak through,\u201d and even then the number of people who get signed is infinitesimally small compared to the amount of people who want to. And guess what, those classically trained musicians are typically better songwriters and musicians than your average pop star, and some of them are competing with you as well, \u00e0 l\u00e0 Lady Gaga and Jordan Rudess from Dream Theater. Now, if you read through all that and didn't just skim saying \u201cyeah yeah music's tough,\u201d and you still think you might want to try out the music business, then maybe, just maybe a music career is worth it for you. Because I can't tell you how many people didn't give serious thought to what the vast majority of their lives would look like before they potentially made it big in music. It's long lonely hours in a practice room, or at a desk studying and emailing for gigs, or writing, or working for little to no pay while doing a day job, or taking on way more debt than you can realistically pay. It burns a lot of people out and leaves a lot more very disappointed with their choices. But if you have grit and persevere through all the hardships, and more than your fair share of talent and work ethic in the long term, then sure, it will be worth it for you because you'll have at least tried your hardest, and most people find their niche in the musical world eventually, even if you're not the next Pavarotti or MJ.

            "answer_text": "Compared to what? The professional musicians I\u2019ve met and worked with \u2014 successful or not \u2014 just about all recount not even giving it a thought: this was simply what they knew they had to do. How do you say whether what\u2019s your life\u2019s intended purpose is worth it? Being a musician is hard work, and it\u2019s invariably going to mean frustration and disappointment, at least sometimes. If you\u2019re smart enough and willing to work hard enough to Ben a professional musician, but you aren\u2019t completely dedicated to it, then those disappointments and frustrations are going to make it seem not worth it, compared to other things you could be doing. Every time that happens, if you have what you think are good options, you\u2019ll be thinking of quitting, and you\u2019ll probably do it a time some point. If you are truly driven to be a musician, this sort of thing will instead seem like just any other unavoidable life disappointment\u2014devastating or not\u2014and the thought of quitting is much, much less likely to even occur to you. It all sorts itself out, and there aren\u2019t many \u201cjust in it for the money\u201d people around after a couple of big disappointments, which will certainly come for everyone (though what\u2019s disappointing for, say, Mick Jagger in 1973 is a lot differently from what is disappointing for a beginning bluegrass banjo player this year\u2014but they\u2019re both disappointing). An interesting variant is the capable musician who has chosen to do it all part time and have a \u201creal job.\u201d They may do well, musical-career-wise, and they may avoid some real-world problems (inability to pay bills, too much travel, and routine humiliating circumstances, mostly), but they also invariably will not be the musicians they could have been, and that will mean its own frustrations. I guess what it all comes down to is this: if the question even occurs to you when you\u2019re deciding what to do with your life, then that means answer almost certainly is going to be no. ",
