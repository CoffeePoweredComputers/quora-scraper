            "answer_text": "Look for an experienced violinist who will accompany you to a reputable violin dealer. Explain your circumstances to the dealer, including the most you'd like to spend. The dealer will present you with a selection of instruments within your price range, (and likely a couple beyond your price range). Ask your violinist friend to play the same melodies and scales on each instrument. Listen carefully for tone, timbre, and definition. Though you may not be experienced, your ears will hear the differences between the instruments. Let your impressions guide you, along with the impression of your violinist friend. As a beginner you will need a guide through the process, someone interested in you getting what you need, and someone to help provide you with insight and experience you do not yet have. Look for that person. ",
