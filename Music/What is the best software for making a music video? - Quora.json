            "answer_text": "IF you mean to say Audio video editing apps that would be more specific. Adobe Premium Clip - Free Adobe Premiere Clip is one of the big names when it comes to video editor apps. It has a laundry list of features, including the ability to auto-generate videos using your images and video if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself. If that\u2019s not your thing, you can edit your video manually using a variety of tools, effects, and music. The app boasts that you can use your own music but some users have found this process to be difficult. It does sync and work with Adobe Premiere Pro so you can start a project on one and continue on the next one. However, you'll need an Adobe Creative Cloud account to make all the syncing work. Free Video Editor - Free Free Video Editor is a lame name for an app. However, it's still one of the better video editor apps. It\u2019s a simple video editor that lets you do the basic stuff like trim video, organize your clips, and add music. You\u2019ll also find some additional features like the ability to add emoji and text to videos and a variety of video effects to make things a little more fun. It\u2019s great for stuff like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, but it\u2019s not powerful enough for bigger productions. At the very least, this one is completely free to use. Funinmate Video Effects Editor Funimate is one of the surprisingly popular, but not overly powerful video editor apps. It bills itself as being a great app for making music videos or simple videos out of the stuff you already have on your device. There are 15 video filters that you can play with and the creation process is fairly painless. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to use on a serious video. It does have 15 video effects to spruce things up a bit. You can download it for free to try it out yourself. You can also check among the 13 best Video editing apps. Audio Editing Apps Audacity Not sure if its free or has in-app purchases but its really a great app for audio editing. Audacity is a great open-source audio recording and editing program compatible with most operating systems. The software lets you record live audio through a mixer or microphone; you can also import MP3, WAV, AIFF and OGG file formats -- then, digitize previous recordings, edit them and export. It comes with an array of effects, from Equalization to Bass Boost, and lets you remove superfluous background noise. There are keyboard shortcuts to optimize your workflow, too. And the best part? It comes with automatic crash recovery. Audio Tool AudioTool is a great beat-making app, similar to GarageBand. It has a simple, visually pleasing interface, and lets you create complex audio arrangements with more than 14 effects. AudioTools also has a helpful Wiki page that teaches you how to perform actions; for example, how to set up your MIDI controller or use the Splitter tool. When you're finished making a beat, export the audio as an MP3 file. Check it out in the Chrome Web Store. Click audio editing applications for more. ",
