A consistent plan of musical experiences (practicing, listening, reading, writing) with the proper constant guidance should do the trick. Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Try HDpiano(dot)com if you want to learn accompaniment real fast. FlowKey for solo piano. I learned best by learning different styles of music. Example: New age piano music strengthened by fingers and developed my sense of Melody. Favorite new age pianists Ludovico Einaudi and Helen Jane Long (although the web says she's classical but I think her music sounds new age-y). Classical taught me sight reading and structure. I like Haydn and Chopin. Accompaniment taught me chords, inversions, progressions, rhythm. Pop and rock songs are my favorite to play. I exercised my fingers a lot to develop agility and stamina. Rolling a rubber ball between my fingers helped, and also scales and hanon exercises. But I believe if you want to learn something fast, start with accompaniment (chords, rhythm). HDpiano is a great website to learn your favorite pop and rock songs that you want to sing to. Check out my Instagram @mraebermudez. I learned to play piano last year. I started with accompaniment then as you'll see in my videos as I moved on to new age and solo piano. Good luck! ",
