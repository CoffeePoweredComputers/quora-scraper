            "answer_text": "Now let me ask you this. Do you think V has a sense of self importance. If you know him well, you will know that he is anything but humble, selfless, and kind to everyone, especially to his fans. Although he is self-aware of himself, doesn't mean he only thinks of himself. He is considerate of others as well. He loves and cares about the members. He preaches the equality between all the members by telling the fans to love all the members because BTS is made up of seven guys. He is also a family oriented person, so he loves his family more than anything, and it must've been hard for him to reveal to everyone his struggles he was facing. Yet, he knows how to set boundaries, but addressing to saesang fans about stalking them and invading their privacy. He talks with his fans on Weverse whoever he can and as a way to calm him and distract him form his problems. He is dedicated to his fans and has even made a Purple Heart as a way to express his love to his fans. The Purple Heart means that he will love and trust them for a long time. Now how is that self important in any way. Secondly, do you think he has a lack of empathy? Because he is more emphatic that you think he is able to understand his members on a deeper level, especially Jimin. He helps make them better by putting on a smile for them, and hid bubbly personality to brighten the mood. With him, there is never a dull moment. He never seems fazed by anything not because he doesn't have any empathy or consideration for other people, it is because he doesn't care about what other people think about him. He is expressive about his feelings, meaning if anyone can understand how someone feels about another person, it is him because he can empathize with them with their experience with it. When he was reading his letter to Jimin about their long lasting friendship he began crying and getting emotional. The letter was his way of baring his soul out to his friend who he has had established a bond since high school and since then have only gotten stronger than ever. He considered his feelings for his fans, apologetic towards him for always being on the receiving end, but Jimin quickly comforted him by telling him he learns many things from him and that V also helps him as much as he does as well. the fact that V would think that even if Jimin doesn't see it that way, tells you just how considerate he is of the people he loves, including his members and Jimin, his best friend and soulmate. Third of all, do you think he has a need for excessive admiration? Like I said, he is humble if anything and has never tried to get attention to himself. Have you seen him ever do that? Many people have said that he is getting attention by telling his fans that his grandma died. Now, how is that getting attention? Instead of thinking about difficult it must\u2019ve been for V to ever reveal us and cope with the grief, and how devastated he is about the sudden passing of his grandma who has taken care of him since he was little, people just assume that he was trying to gain attention. Have they not considered how he would even feel through this entire ordeal. Have they ever thought that perhaps, V thought this was something that fans deserved to know after they have been worried about him for so long. This was V\u2019s chance to be vulnerable and open up to his fans about his personal things, which means he loves them enough to tell them about something intimate about him, and people just ruin that by making a baseless assumption about his actions. He has every right to tell them what he wants and shouldn't be our right to judge him for those decisions. Lastly, do you think he believes that he is unique and that he should get special treatment. I don't know about him personally, but I know enough to know that he wouldn't think that he should be treated differently than anyone else. Like I said, he wants nothing but for his members to be treated equally by fans because he cares about them so much like friends, brother, and family. They have become important people in his lives, and he has mentioned that he cannot live without them. Again does that show that he wants special treatment. It is not bad to think that you are unique because you are, so if V ever thinks that way, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But what's wrong is bragging other about how special they are and deeming others inferior to him and belittling them for their worth. It is when they make everything about him, and from the way he talks about his members, it doesn't seem he is condescending or full of himself. Also, have you seen how he treats his fans at fan sign events. He treats them like friends, being playful with them with care and doing anything he can to make them laugh and happy and to feel comfortable in his presence. Sometimes, being around your idol might become awkward and uncomfortable because of the unfamiliarity of the situation. But he does anything to make them feel like friends, like they are just talking to a normal human being that they admire and look up to and have a liking towards. He makes them comfortable around him. Especially when a fanboy came to a fan sign once since it is not common of them to come, he was taken aback and surprised yet, he was still happy and treated him with the same respect and love and care as other fans as well. He doesn't care about their gender they care about who they are as a person, which is important to consider when you first meet someone. He is open to meeting new people and he is considerate towards them. He treats them with care and love and he would never tried to degrade them for their worth. I think although I don't know him personally and he doesn't reveal more than he lets on, I think he is genuine towards others. There is only so much he could hide about himself before they begin to show and if his actions were insincere, then it would start to show. But it didn't, meaning he truly does treat others that way to others without putting a phony facade about his treatment. So tell me now, does he seem narcissistic to you because if he does, then I think you just don't like him and if you don't then, it\u2019s fine, but I think you should keep that to yourself and not try to use it to make assumptions about him that aren't true. But, if he doesn't then, I hope you will try to see him in a more positive light and get to know him more for the beautiful soul that he is. ",

            "answer_text": "The study behind narcissism is that people who are narcissistic, are actually happy to say they are a narcissist\u2014they know that and appreciate it in themselves.  Taehyung knows he is attractive, but that doesn\u2019t make him narcissistic. That said he, like most people, looks at himself in most reflective surfaces to check his appearance and has been voted as \u201cThe Most Handsome\u201d which is where some begin to think he is narcissistic. But, Taehyung is not egotistical about his visuals and does not talk about them in the same sense as a narcissist might. In my opinion, I think most people are a little narcissistic and it\u2019s a good thing. If you don\u2019t love yourself a little, who will? TTFN! ",
