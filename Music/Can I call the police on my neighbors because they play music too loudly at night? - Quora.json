            "answer_text": "Yes, you can call the police, but whether the police do anything about your neighbour\u2019s music depends upon: Whether the police are responsible for enforcing the local noise bylaw (for example, that responsibility might belong to a city by-law officer);Whether the police (assuming they are in fact responsible for enforcing the noise bylaw) actually have resources available to investigate your complaint, relative to their other calls that night; andWhether your neighbour is actually in violation of the relevant noise bylaw. This may depend upon the time of day/night and day of the work, plus the noise level of the music (as measured in decibels) relative to the limits imposed in the noise bylaw.",

A lot of times people honestly don't think they are disturbing others and are more than willing to oblige if you ask. And then there won't be any animosity between them and you for calling the police on them. I know I would absolutely turn it down if asked and would certainly appreciate it if they gave me the courtesy of asking me first. The last thing I want is to disturb others. ",

Please ask a question that hasn\u2019t been asked yet\u2026\u2026.. UK - no, we already have enough to do!! Police don\u2019t have a power of entry because someone is playing loud music!! Ask your neighbours to stop first and explain why - trying to get to sleep/study etc. Are they the house owner? If not, complain to the landlord or the council. Playing loud music isn\u2019t an offence unless dealt with as antisocial behaviour. You need a lot of evidence and it may take a while. Keep a diary of events - days/dates/times/what happened. ",
