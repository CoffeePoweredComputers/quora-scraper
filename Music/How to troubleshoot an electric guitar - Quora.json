            "answer_text": "When looking for no volume or a pot/switch not functioning I troubleshoot using a Greenlee multimeter. But\u2026I had a Stratocaster I built for a customer and it had no volume whatsoever. I removed the pickguard around 10 times, checked everything, scratching my head. I finally left it plugged-in, the amp turned on volume at 3 or 4 and began removing the pick-guard. When I lifted the pickguard at the area where the switch was located the signal made it to the amp. Problem? The 5 way switch was shorted-out to the body shielding as I had shielded this guitar body using the conductive paint, the pick-guard was shielded with copper foil. My solution was a thin rectangular plastic piece of .050\u2033 thickness under the switch attached by contact cement. I placed a plastic piece under the switch in the control cavity on every Strat or Tele I built from then on. Anything can be wrong, it just takes being a detective and following your \u201cgut\u201d feeling of where the problem may be. ",

How to troubleshoot it will depend on what the issue is. You really need to first know what you want to fix or improve upon. It is something totally different to troubleshoot a guitar that won\u2019t stay in tune good enough, to fret buzz issues, to a truss rod that won\u2019t move, to strings slipping off the fretboard edges, to sound dropping in and out, to unwanted noise (like hum), to problems with the finish, binding etc. If you know, specifically, what the issue with your guitar is, you can ask a specific question about it here. Better yet, you will likely find the answer by using the search feature here or searching online. Most of the time you will find YouTube videos demonstrating how to deal with different electric guitar issues. ",
