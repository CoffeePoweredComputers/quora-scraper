            "answer_text": "#1 - you need to have access to a piano, or a keyboard (most have keys the size of piano keys, and a detachable sustain pedal). If you don\u2019t have one at home, try your school or church or a friend\u2019s house, but you will need to spend a good deal of time there, so make sure they know it\u2019s an every-day sort of thing! At home, find some time when your playing is comfortable for the rest of the family (a separate room is best, but pianos have a tendency to find their way into the living room). There are many ways to approach learning. One that I do not recommend is the YouTube thing where you watch someone play an easy piece, and you put your fingers where they put their fingers. You will learn how to play a few pieces - maybe - and nothing else at all. Typically, a student learns from a series of lesson books, which begin at the complete total beginning. You learn what a key is, what a note is, how the timing system works, and how music is written down, and you will learn to write it yourself, or play what others have written. Lesson books don\u2019t just teach familiar songs, but have a lot of songs of all types - much as when you learn to read, you don\u2019t read the same stories your mother read to you, but you go out on whole new adventures. Learning piano is not that hard, if you are willing to take it at your own pace, and don\u2019t get too anxious to play difficult pieces quickly. You do most of the learning yourself. Even if you have a teacher, that\u2019s just a half-hour a week, while you might spend 5 to 10 hours practicing. During that time, you are inventing ways to help yourself learn the progressive lessons they offer, as well as exploring other music that is not in the lesson books. You can sing while you are playing - it is as very good thing to do, to help your mind feel the relationships of the keys and the tones they produce. You can also learn to play \u201cby ear\u201d - hearing songs and trying to match them on the keyboard. Some people are very successful at this, especially if they learn \u201cchords\u201d, which are set patterns of tones, much like the chords guitarists use. But sometimes if you begin with the chord approach, or the \u201csound-it-out\u201d approach, you may end up never learning notes, which are the key to being able to play just about anything (just as you learn to speak by sounding out the words, but you are enabled to learn a whole bunch more if you learn letters and words and sentences and grammar).

            "answer_text": "The obvious answer is \u201canything with a keyboard\u201d, but in terms of sound, a piano is a percussion instrument with resonant strings determining pitch (chordophone) and an acoustic amplifier made from a thin piece of wood (membraneophone). The closest instrument in this sense is a hammer dulcimer. There are a wide variety of plucked string/sound board instruments with percussive sound: harp, lute, guitar, mandolin, zithers like Koto and Guzheng, Tar, Sitar, Kantele, Rhebab, Shamisen, Pipa, etc. Really, the piano is unique in the extreme number of strings, the resonance, the mechanism and the power. It is a massively polyphonic instrument able to keep up with a full-bore symphony orchestra in concerti. The only other instrument in this regard is pipe organ, but it does not have the visceral impact like piano, with the sound leaping to life when ten or more hammers strike at once. ",
