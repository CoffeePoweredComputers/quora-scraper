I got used to it. I remember when songs from as far back as 1964 were popular and played regularly on the radio. One song for example was \u2018Love Child\u2019 by the Supremes. Since then I remember what year it was and what I was doing at the time I first heard it on the radio. Some songs really invoke some dear memories! ",
