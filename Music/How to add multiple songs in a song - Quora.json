            "answer_text": "By using Virtual DJ app or software Well... Its been 3 years that iam using virtual DJ as my song customiser and now i have become expert of this software. Its an amazing platform by which you cam not only make your own song which is cocktail of many songs and you can also become your own personal DJ by mixing audios the way you want. How it works?  There are two decks, put one song on red one and other on blue one.There is a equaliser in between by which you can switch to both decks for example if equaliser is on red side then you will only hear song on red deck.You can also resonate both songs by taking equaliser in between.There are many effects which you can use:OverloopFlangerFlippin doubleSirenReverbBeatgridSo if you have laptop download its software and for mobiles download its app.Become your own David guetta or Alan walker, they also started thier carrier with this software. Hope it helps. Thanks for reading. ",
