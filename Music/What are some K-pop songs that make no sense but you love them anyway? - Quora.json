            "answer_text": "Let me give it a go!  Zimzalabim-- RedVelvet The only vibe this song gives me is alien abduction. I don't really understand the lyrics and what the hell does \u201czimzalabim\u201d even mean! Still bop to it tho. Edit: wtf I just saw this! Who else sees Yeri floating in thin air?!  BTS-- IDOL Ahh the song that got me into kpop, throughout November in 2018 YouTube wouldn't stop suggesting it for me and I gave in! If I didn't know the back story to this song (talking about haters) I would've never been able to tell what its about. But the song is fire!  Ddu ddu du-- Black pink Well other than talking about you being a savage what else? Honestly it sounds like a simpler version of CardiB. I loved the visuals tho and that electronic sound!  Bon bon chocolat-- Ever glow I'm sorry I just don't get this song, \u201cbon bon chocolat\u201d (if my French isn't rusty) would mean \u201csweets chocolate\u201d or \u201cgood good chocolate\u201d. So then they'd be saying \u201csweets chocolate, go up to the sky!\u201d I really don't get it:( still easily their best song:)  love shot\u2014EXO I don't know if I remember correctly the lyrics to this song, but from my memory it never seemed to make sense to me. But nonetheless a good introduction to EXO in my opinion.  Hard carry-- GOT7 Not even the name made sense. Seemed like a good reason to yell and look badass B) Couldn't stop playing it the day I first heard it:) Hope you enjoyed my list:) Quora's best friend ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s one I can think of- Bar Bar Bar by Crayon Pop. Iconic? Yes. Catchy? Yes. Did it make sense? No. It sounds more like an anthem thing than a k-pop song. Not gonna lie, I do love it and it is a bop. And those outfits?  Meh\u2026.Iconic and cute but a little cringe. Also I\u2019m going to take advantage of the Crayon Pop subject and say: I\u2019m happy for Soyul! Her daughter is so cute. Anyways\u2026.yeah, this song makes no sense. \u201cThank you to my mama and papa!\u201d (English translation) It reminds me of that line in that one Itzy song I\u2019m pretty sure was sang by Ryujin. (Honorable Mention: Red Flavor by Red Velvet. Either it\u2019s about fruit and summer or there\u2019s a deeper meaning\u2026.we may never know.) ",
