If you couldn\u2019t sing when you were younger, it probably hasn\u2019t gotten any better, and if you could before, you probably still can (with some age-related vocal deterioration). If you\u2019re enjoying this hobby with your contemporaries, look at it this way, they probably can\u2019t even hear you that well, anyway! ",
