            "answer_text": "Having several of each, more or less the same thing as any other scale length bass is for. They tend to be a bit lighter and of course the shorter neck can be helpful for people with short arms and/or smaller hands. Certain techniques (such as slapping) can be difficult on a short scale bass. It\u2019s a string tension issue. But other than that, the notes are the same and there are some good short scale basses out there. In my collection: Gibson \u201cSG\u201d bass (early 2000s, the first year re-issue). very deep classic Gibson sound, not quite as muddy as the late 60s models. Good for retro-SF sound bands, etc.Fender Mustang (2013 model \u2014 the new ones). P-J pickup configuration with decent output. The old Mustangs had a relatively low output P pickup with the plastic cover similar to Mustang 6 strings. It\u2019s a great beginner bass for sure, but I also use it otherwise. I can play this a long time with my short arms and somewhat chubby fingers.Gibson SG fretless - 1978 model single pickup. Very interesting sound, combining the mud of earlier Gibsons with the fretless sound. I don\u2019t have a double bass, so I use that sometimes to cover where I might really use a double bass if I had one. (Contrast that with one of my I\u2019ll never give this up fretless Fender P of the same vintage. Both fretless, but a totally different sound.There used to be a stigma against short scale unless you were a kid or just learning. Even then, they\u2019d say get a full size bass and grow into it. A lifetime of having a bad shoulder is my advice to not listen to that advice. I\u2019d play a modified P-bass (and on 6 string a heavy old Les Paul) back when I was 15 - 17. That weight combined with hours of practice standing and then being in a band did a number on my shoulder. Trouble is, back then there weren\u2019t the serious short scale options you have now and I used the heavy LP clone because I couldn\u2019t afford a much lighter but a lot more expensive SG 6 string.
