            "answer_text": "One thing I haven\u2019t seen much mention of in this thread is that the Stones, in particular the main songwriting team of Jagger/Richards, were never able to meet with similar levels of success in their solo efforts. There is something about the tension between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards that makes them far more effective musically together than either has been able to be separately. Both of them have had solo recording and side projects, some of which have even found some success, but Jagger or Richards alone just somehow always end up sounding like\u2026 less. The whole is greater than the parts. The Beatles, on the other hand, were all able to enjoy fairly successful solo (or non-Beatles) careers. Paul, on his own or with Wings, churned out a succession of hit songs through the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, and even in recent years has managed to create new material that is found worthy of airplay on radio. George had the misfortune of becoming a very talented songwriter while in a band with Lennon and McCartney. Freedom from the Beatles enabled him to grow as a performer and songwriter in ways that he never would have been able to within the band-leaving the Beatles enabled George Harrison to be even better than he was within the band. John Lennon also made music outside of the band that was more suited to what he was feeling, and was pretty successful artistically and in terms of sales with the music he created beyond the Beatles. Also, Lennon was able to withdraw from the insane fame cycle for a few years, sort out some issues in his life, and focus on non-musical goals with his family in ways that would never have been available had he still been in The Beatles. (in my opinion) Sean Ono Lennon is a far more sane and stable person than the offspring of John and Yoko would be expected to grow into, given the reputation of both his parents. Ringo also was able to make a decent musical career post-Beatles. He managed to enjoy some solid hits as a solo performer, and the apparently never-ending touring of Ringo\u2019s All-Starr Band has enabled him to keep playing music and making a living doing it. No member of the Rolling Stones has produced work outside of the Rolling Stones that can match the the individual output of anything each of the Beatles was able to produce individually. This is not necessarily a fact that makes the Stones inherently less than the Beatles. There is much to be said for being able to maintain the core relationship of the Rolling Stones over all of these decades, and maintain some degree of artistic integrity through so many personnel changes. It\u2019s not better, it\u2019s not worse, it\u2019s just different. ",

            "answer_text": "The Rolling Stones and the Beatles were both \u201cBritish Invasion\u201d bands but The Stones have kept performing while the Beatles were done by 1970. What was the difference? As other\u2019s have said, the dynamic in the Beatles was always centered around John and Paul. They were best mates in Liverpool, founded a predecessor band and then the Beatles. There was a lot of personal infighting between them, especially centered around Cynthia, Linda and Yoko. Ultimately they couldn\u2019t stand to be around each other and the band split. While they still had great affection for each other, they just couldn\u2019t get over the hurt and animosity each had caused. John was happy to continue on solo or working with Yoko until his death in 1980, while Paul again found success with Wings and worked off and on with the two other surviving Beatles. The Stones never really went through what the Beatles did in regards to being based off of just two personalities. While Mick Jagger was the front man and the voice of the group, the were an ensemble and knew that the sum total of the group was greater than that of the individuals. Each member has done solo projects over the years, but they have always remained tight and have continued to produce new albums and tour, continuously being one of the top grossing acts on the road. As to why they do it, the answer is really quite simple. The boys genuinely like each other and what they do. Here is a Tweet done by Keith Richards shortly before they announced the last leg of their world tour. I Think it answers your question best and it\u2019s right from the source. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished yet. It\u2019s still too early to talk about the Stones\u2019 legacy. There\u2019s one thing that we haven\u2019t yet achieved and that\u2019s to really find out how long you can do this. It\u2019s still such a joy to play with this band that you can\u2019t really let go of it.\u201d @officialKeef pic.twitter.com/I4C3UA9KIL\u2014 The Rolling Stones (@RollingStones) February 25, 2018\n ",
