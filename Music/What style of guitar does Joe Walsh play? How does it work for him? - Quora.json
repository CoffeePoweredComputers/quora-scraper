            "answer_text": "If you see Joe Walsh playing with the Eagles, he\u2019ll place several different guitars in one concert. I seen him play a Fender Stratocaster, a Gibson Les Paul, and some model Rickenbacker on one night. Walsh rocks. It\u2019s a bit of classic rock mixed with the blues, country, and more. You can definitely tell that he was inspired by some British musicians from the previous generation. ",

If you're asking what instruments he likes, he's most known for playing Gibsons, but he plays and has played many brands over the years including Carvin. Walsh, by the way, also plays piano, though he's not as known for it. ",
