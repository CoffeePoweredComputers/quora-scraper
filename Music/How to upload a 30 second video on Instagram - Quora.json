            "answer_text": "To upload to Instagram, the video file must be on your phone. As an editor, you will need to export your video, then compress it for your mobile device. Finally, you will send the compressed mobile file to your phone and then upload to Instagram. That may sound complicated, but it\u2019s very easy to do. Instagram Video Aspect Ratio Instagram will allow you to display your video with a 16:9 widescreen ratio or with a square 1:1 ratio. So, what does that mean? How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: Instagram Ratio To those of you with experience working with Instagram, you may remember that the canvas size was once 640 x 640. While that holds true for mobile, Instagram can now be viewed from a desktop at a max size of 1080 x 1080. A good rule of thumb is to always use at least a 1080 canvas. Instagram will automatically convert the footage for you, so it\u2019s best to max out the size to get the best look. Let\u2019s assume you are working with HD 1080 footage. That means Instagram can display the video at 16:9 (1920 x 1080) or 1:1 (1080 x 1080). In reality, Instagram will automatically adjust the video size for the type of device. A 1920 x 1080 video will play on a desktop at 1080 x 680 and on a phone at roughly 648 x 365. 16:9 Instagram Video Upload 16:9 Videos to Instagram. Step by step directions on The Beat: A Blog by PremiumBeat - | Music: \u201c60\u2032s A Go-Go\u201d by Olive Musique #VideoProduction #VideoEdit As you can see above, the 16:9 aspect ratio acts as a traditional video. It allows you to fit more information widthwise. You can achieve this look by uploading a regular 1920 x 1080 video. The downside of 16:9 is that you will not take up as much valuable retail space on a user\u2019s phone. If you are creating an advertisement, you will want to take as much screen space as possible. That is why ads tend to use a 1:1 ratio. 1:1 Instagram Video Upload 1:1 Videos to Instagram. Step by step directions on The Beat: A Blog by PremiumBeat - | Music: \u201c60\u2032s A Go-Go\u201d by Olive Musique #VideoProduction #VideoEdit The 1:1 aspect ratio is much larger heightwise, but it crops so much detail from the sides. This format is preferred because it allows you to add more large legible text on screen. This is great for videos that are trying to educate you on a topic. Think of all the quick cooking recipe videos you see. The 1:1 aspect ratio gives you more room to write down the steps and recipe. The 1:1 ratio was achieved by uploading a 1080 x 1080 project file. Once you decide which ratio suits your project best, then you will know what canvas size you should set up in your NLE. Non-Linear Editor Sequence Settings The first step to editing a video for Instagram is setting up your sequence. Just make sure your final product is under 60 seconds, as that is the max time allowed by Instagram. For 16:9 \u2013 edit your video normally as 1920 x 1080 For 1:1 \u2013 set your sequence to 1080 x 1080 Quick note: 1:1 will give you a perfectly square canvas. If you are using 1920 x 1080 footage, be sure to watch the whole clip and make sure everything you need stays in frame. As a regular 16:9 video is still 1920 x 1080, the following steps will focus on creating 1:1 videos at 1080 x 1080. 1. Adobe Premiere Pro How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: 1x1 Sequence Click Sequence > Sequence Settings Change the Video Frame Size to 1080 x 1080 (1:1) / Leave at 1920 x 1080 for (16:9) Click OK Now edit your project as normal \u2014 add any transitions, text, and graphics. How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: Compress Encoder When you are finished editing: Export the sequence Open Adobe Media Encoder and import the file you just created Open the Preset Browser Apply the 1080p preset for your device (Android, Apple, Mobile) Compress the video file \u2014 Note: This will always export a 1920 x 1080 file. That is not an issue. 1. Final Cut Pro X How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: FCPX Instagram Sequence Window > Project Properties (Command + J) In the Inspector window, click Modify Settings Change the Video Properties Format to Custom  Change the Resolution to 1080 x 1080 (1:1) / Leave at 1920 x 1080 for (16:9) Now edit your project as normal \u2014 add any transitions, text, and graphics. When you are finished editing, you have some options with Final Cut Pro X. You can Share to an Apple Device or Send to Compressor. In this case, using Compressor is overkill since we are only using the video file on mobile. That said, you can still use Compressor if you want. How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: FCPX Instagram Share Share to an Apple Device File > Share > Apple Devices 1080p (The Apple Device preset will work with some modern Android devices.) Click Share \u2014 Note: This will export a 1920 x 1080 file. That is not an issue. Transfer to Mobile How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: Transfer to Mobile Image via Shutterstock No matter if you used a 16:9 or 1:1 ratio, the final compressed mobile video will be 1920 x 1080 \u2014 this won\u2019t be a problem. When you upload to Instagram, you will choose crop settings. More on that later.  Now that you have a compressed Instagram mobile file, you will need to transfer the file to your phone. For Mac/iPhone users, the best way is to use Apple AirDrop. For Mac/Android or PC/Mobile you can use programs like Google Drive or Dropbox. As a Mac/Android user, I personally prefer using Google Drive since it\u2019s faster. Apple AirDrop Mac users with iPhones will find it easiest to send files using AirDrop. You will just drag the compressed Instagram video file to your iPhone. On your iPhone, you will now find the file under Photos. How to Upload 60-Second Videos to Instagram: AirDrop Instagram Open a Finder Window Click on AirDrop Drag and Drop the compressed Instagram video file to your iPhone On your iPhone, open Photos and verify the file transferred Google Drive Google Drive works for both Mac and PC and will transfer files to iPhone and Android phones.
