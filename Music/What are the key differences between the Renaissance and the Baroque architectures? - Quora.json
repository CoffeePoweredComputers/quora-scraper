            "answer_text": "AqArchitectural styles have evolved over several centuries, several countries, and it is quite frequent that the same building includes more than one style. Wikipedia includes detailed description of both styles. If you are interested in the Renaissance, you should look on Quora for my answer to \u201cThe term \u201cRenaissance\u201d means rebirth. What was reborn in Europe at this time?\u201d I want to show some typical churches of various periods, and HOW THE CHANGES OF THE CHURCH ARE REFLECTED IN THE VARIOUS STYLES. HAve a look at a famous Roman style Basilica : Notre Dame la Grande in Poitiers. Outside it is massive, with little, small windows but very rich decoration. It is characteristic of the 11\u201312th centuries : people were not familiar with the stories of the Bible, did not know how to read and write and often were not baptised, so couldn\u2019t enter the church. Outside : a the wealth of the sculptures and the richness of the entrance .  Inside the lack of large windows is compensated by decorated colums, and a sober atmosphera. The Church wants to convert the flock to its message by sermons.  The following period is called \u201cGothic\u201d (actually a derogatory term adopted many centuries afterwards, because for the Italians the Goths were barbarian German tribes). A typical example is Chartres (beginning of 13th century). The triomphant Church as well as the progress of the architects is expressed by the UPWARD MOVEMENT of all lines - towards God. Also you will find a lot of inside light due to beautiful glass windows and a cross shaped basic design of the building. (see at the end of this Quora answer)  The next period is called REnaissance or rebirth, because the artistic world re-discovered Greek/Roman statues and tried to imagine the architecture of that period (while scavenging antique buildings for their marble). Simplicity, sobriety are the best way to describe the interiors of that period and Brunelleschi was the Gehry of the epoch (1350 - 1550) Incidentally the protestant movement had already started to question the statues, pictures of the Catholic church, which however balanced interior simplicity with outside rich decoration. (The inside of the Medici\u2019s family church, San Lorenzo of Florence is the best illustration, see above. ) For external richness, an incredible harmony of white, green and red marble and an explosion of statues, decorative motifs see the Florence Santa Maria del Fiore hereunder  The baroque period corresponds to the time when the Church decided to react against the Protestant movement. Since the Protestants wanted to respect the Bible\u2019s commandments not to represent people or objects, the Council of Trente (1545\u201363) recommended that the faithfull should be overwhelmed by the magnificence of church decoration. Baroque is sober in the exterior, unashamedly beautiful on the inside. The Church withdraws in front of the attack but does not follow the trend defined by its conpetition. Rome has many baroque buildings, but in my view the most typical is in SOuthern Germany : the Wysskirche. Here what it looks from the outside :  Now when you enter, this is what you discover :  Just for comparison, this is how the Chartres cathedral four centuries earlier managed to convey the message of the Church by sober lines and straight lines :  ",

            "answer_text": "The terms themselves provide the basic differences. The root word in Renaissance is naissance, which is French for birth. So the Renaissance was a rebirth (in perception) of an earlier (Greek & Roman) classical style. Now look at the Baroque. This comes from the French word of the same spelling & is the name of an imperfect pearl. Look at a baroque & you will understand the style of art after which it is named. Renaissance: Classical Architecture & Design as well as style of art. The goal being to imitate the style of classical Greek & Roman art & architecture. Baroque: The embellishment of an extremely ornate and expanded version of the Renaissance's classical style. Note that the Baroque period developed as an ornate embellishment of the Renaissance style. It is, in effect, a descendant. The next round of great art would be named the Neoclassical style, which was a rejection of the Baroque and a reversion to the classical style evoked in Renaissance art. Sub-note: It is believed that with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 that many classical texts which were lost to the West (western 1/2 of the old Roman Empire) were rediscovered when they were carried by refugees of the final collapse of the last vestiges of the Eastern 1/2 of the Roman Empire. Thus, the spark of the Renaissance was ignited by this rediscovery. ",
