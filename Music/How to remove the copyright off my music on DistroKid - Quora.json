            "answer_text": "If you are doing cover songs, you must purchase a license allowing you to perform covers before uploding them to any digital distributor. If you have placed your music into Distrokid\u2019s Content ID Program and are getting claims against your music on your channel, unless you are large enough to directly monetize with YouTube\u2019s Partner Program, you don\u2019t want to remove the claims. Those claims are making you money; which you will find in your Artist dashboard under income. If you are large enough and wish to apply to the YPP, then you must exit the Content ID Program under Distrokid, and give up the ad revenue it was bringing you. ",
