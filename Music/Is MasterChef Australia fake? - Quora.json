            "answer_text": "I worked on Kitchen Nightmares, which shares some crew with the MasterChef series. I answered this question about that show: How real/staged is Kitchen Nightmares? I can answer about contest shows in general also. Judges don't always pick the most talented person. They may pick the person who is more interesting or who has the better story. But life is like that. Just look at the Oscars. Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for \"Crazy Heart,\" a movie we have all forgotten about, over Colin Firth in \"A Single Man,\" a movie that still haunts me. Bridges has had a wonderful career that deserves an Oscar, but that was one of his less memorable movies. He won because he was Jeff Bridges and people decided he should win one already, not because his was the best performance of that year. I have never worked on a reality show in which the judges were consciously choosing the lesser contestant because they felt pressured to pick the more dramatic one, but when a dude shows up five minutes before auditions are over and he's got a leather vest and no shirt and is talking a million miles a minute and is charming as hell, sometimes he just wins you over with his story more than with his work. The judges are human. ",

            "answer_text": "I am South African. I have never been to Australia, nor do I know any Australians personally. I have had no contact with Masterchef people. (MC is abbreviation for Masterchef). I must say though: I love MC Australia. And sorry to say this, but I despise MC USA.  Regarding USA, I'm not sure that I have anything positive to say. I truly feel that there is loads of room for improvement there. I don't dislike Americans, but I am referring to this particular show. I truly feel the Americans have much to learn from the Australians regarding Masterchef.The Americans, I think, are masters of the entertainment industry, but fail at Masterchef. Masterchef Australia:   \u200b\u200b\u200b1) is more educational 2) the number of episodes are more 3)  the contestants are generally sweet towards each other and appear more knowledgable and insightful regarding food than the Americans. 4) the judges are excellent. They are very knowledgable, professional, well-travelled in the culinary world, experienced, eloquent in speech (especially Matt)...and they are human. They really care for the wellbeing and growth of the contestants. They actually joke at times (when appropriate), they can laugh, they are firm when it's necessary, but are never harsh. They appear to me to be both realistic and sincere; there is no put-on there. Their judging skills are superb. You never get a sense that they are biased in any way. You COULDN'T ask for a better team. I have only positive things to say about them.   \u200b\u200b\u200bThe further one gets down the line regarding seasons, the more seasoned the amateur chefs appear to be. The reason for this seems clear: applicants obviously have watched and studied the previous seasons. They know what the pitfalls are, what the judges like or dislike. They follow the trends. They study famous chefs (many famous chefs make their appearance on MC Australia). So i certainly get the sense that applicants not only prepare themselves, but are progressively more informed. So when all has been said and done, I don't think Masterchef Australia is fake in any way.  \u200b\u200b  PS: I am not the only one who thinks the above.
