            "answer_text": "Not it is not bad\u2026But it is mainstream\u2026. Let me tell you my story..How I gradually shifted my music taste.. I am an Indian Citizen..So as a Child I only listen to my own Hindi Songs..Soon Enough the Western music dawned my place and we started English music although we didn't understand a word..But it became trendy among my friends circle..Not so long I started humming certain tones of the songs..and one fine day I become a regular listener of English Music..Started with Pop,I Spent 2 yrs listening to Akon,Enrique,Taylor Swift,Rihana unaware of Some other musical bands\u2026.Giving halt to that I shifted to listening some Rock Bands like Maroon 5,One Direction,Coldplay ..These all were famous at that time and We are always fascinated towards popular contents..But As I go further into the variety of music,I came across Linkin Park(one of my favourites)..and I reached to the hardcore part of the music\u2026Then I searched a lot of Rock bands..Vintage bands like Queen,Rollimg Stones,Metallica etc\u2026Now I have listened to all the famous Rock bands and Currently I changed my Genre to Blues.. So listening to some Musician is not bad..But Listening only to that Musician is bad and You can't say which one is good unless you try variety\u2026 ",
