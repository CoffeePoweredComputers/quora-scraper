            "answer_text": "\u201cBefore\u201d? We stayed primitive until about 1920, for some definition of the word.. Look, it all depends on what you mean by \u201cprimitive\u201d. We certainly imported many social advances from further south, such as the concept of a state with an administration and permanent taxation (as opposed to asking for contributions to a war). Society was always more egalitarian up here, and we didn\u2019t have the resources to spare for a class of philosophers or even skilled artisans. But we had a fully developed tribal society, with laws, art, and poetry. We had innovators, although they tended to be more engineers than theorists (and still are, to this day). Most of what they achieved has perished; you don\u2019t want to live in a stone house in this climate unless you have central heating, so the architecture was based on wood; without solid houses to store things in you don\u2019t have much need for paper to write things down; archaeologists have to dig very carefully to uncover traces of what they did. Pre-Christian Scandinavians were, in many ways, similar to the various Greek societies in antiquity, except that we had engineers instead of philosophers. (Don\u2019t forget that the Greek philosophers generally hated people who wanted to use their theories for any practical applications whatsoever.) ",
