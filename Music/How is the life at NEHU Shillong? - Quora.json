            "answer_text": "NEHU is a well planned University with it's vast campus and beautiful infrastructure. Life in NEHU is pretty cool. There is a lot of place to hang out,. Students' dhaba being the first choice. Wanna go on a date? There is a water fall in the NEHU campus. If you have friends in NIT Shillong you can meet them in NEHU as they provide accommodation for NIT students as well. Faculty members are just one call away. Most of the teachers are provided with accommodation in campus itself so you can clear all your doubts without the fear that the teacher would be annoyed as he is getting late. If you are planning to get admission in NEHU, I suggest you it is a great idea. ",
