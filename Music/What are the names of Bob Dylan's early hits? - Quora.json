            "answer_text": "By early Bob Dylan hits, I am assuming releases from the 60\u2019s. There are only 2, neither of which made it all the way to Number 1. The iconic \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 back in September 1965, as did \u201cRainy Day Women #12 and 35\u201d in May 1966. But he\u2019s never reached No. 1 on any individual chart until recently with the weird \u201cMurder Most Foul.\u201d The Bob Dylan penned \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single by the Byrds was released in April 1965, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second single \"All I Really Want to Do\", also a Dylan cover, was moderately successful. ",
