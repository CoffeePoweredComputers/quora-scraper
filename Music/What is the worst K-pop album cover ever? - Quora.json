            "answer_text": "Hmm\u2026There are a few that come to mind. Granted, there are many embarrassing covers that could simply be understood as being \u201cof that era\u201d and excusable on those grounds (such as several from the mid-1990s on to the early 2000s that went overboard with intentionally overexposed images\u2026and everyone\u2019s noses disappeared!). Just the same here are the ones that stand out in my memory. Excuse me for adding a few pre-1992 creations to the list. The biggest boyband hit of the late 1980s, with fashion from the \u201cPierrot-meets-military-rule\u201d school of haute couture : \uc18c\ubc29\ucc28 2\uc9d1 (1988) . Yes, even superstars can bring the cringe: \uc774\uc2b9\ucca0 2\uc9d1 (1990) . Not that bad, eh? That is until you see how the liner jacket (if you ever find a copy) had a lazy and hastily rehashed cover image\u2026with his head chopped off and placed in an upper corner, body in the lower corner. \uc2ec\uc2e01\uc9d1 (1991) . To be sure, the second LP release by \uc2e0\uc2b9\ud6c8 stands as a legendary pre-1992 release, ballads like \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0ac\ub791 and all. But shooting an album cover with the man\u2019s face sharply illuminated by the sun, featuring the cafe chain\u2019s name on the window, and calling the album a rather confusing \u201cVol.2\u201d (as if it were a compilation) had so much wrong with it: \uc2e0\uc2b9\ud6c8 2\uc9d1 (1991) . Great. Noise was of the most popular boy groups of the early to mid 1990s (all under \uae40\ucc3d\ud658's insanely successful Line Productions label), and you award them by omitting the handsome fellows and instead putting a silly animal comic graphic on the cover of their third release?: Noise/ 3rd Revolution (1995) . It admittedly doesn\u2019t feel right for me to post this one, since \ubc15\ubbf8\uacbd is such a wonderful soul and I have had nothing but very pleasant interactions with her over the past 20+ years. However, Line Productions really messed things up with the cover of her most popular release and I have to include it in this list. Just read everything as printed the cover out loud to hear how wrong it all is: \ubc15\ubbf8\uacbd 2\uc9d1 (1995) . Psychedelic eyesore from summertime\u2019s forever best sellers: \ucfe83\uc9d1 (1996) . What\u2019s wrong with this picture? BASIS was always a trio, but the two female members who both sang and played violin on the first two BASIS recordings (sisters \uae40\uc544\uc5f0, \uae40\uc5f0\ube48) left after the 2nd album. And so, the lone core member \uc815\uc7ac\ud615 put out this 3rd BASIS release with a mildly awkward framing of the cover. The title of the album is what makes the cover of the album all the weirder, considering that he\u2019s now a solo act: \ubca0\uc774\uc2dc\uc2a4 3\uc9d1 FRIENDS (1997) . A chopped off face on top of your head is never a good idea, and oddly placed color points on a black and white layout can be remarkably distracting, no matter how intentionally done: Position 3\uc9d1 (1998) . Funky layout and bad text placement: Baby Vox #3 (1999) . Ew\u2026why? The early 2000s was a weird time for everyone after the IMF era, namely for there being less money floating around to produce and promote. Admittedly, Turtles were the best hybrid trot-dance team made for the masses, and were mad catchy on the first two albums. But c\u2019mon (RIP Turtle Man) : \uac70\ubd80\uae30 2\uc9d1 (2003) . The visual J-rock concept taken to the local extreme (and Eve being rather successful at that). But putting your record company\u2019s URL on the cover?: \uc774\ube0c2\uc9d1 (2001) . One of the last successful guy/gal quartets, albeit with covers like this: \uc0f5 3\uc9d1 (2000)  . In the post-LP market, the freedom to leave the square-shaped release brought about a good amount of creativity with layout. Unfortunately, some look really weird both from a distance as well as up close. Mind you, there was an alternate for this one used as well, sans invisible name and apparent Pinocchio nose: \ubc15\ud654\uc694\ube44 6\uc9d1 (2008) ",

I always think it\u2019s uncreative and boring when kpop idols just are plastered on the cover of their album. I know what they look like and unless the picture is really cool and artsy it looks kind of lazy.The colours are ugly and honestly don\u2019t fit the concept of the song. Why\u2019re there random splashes of yellow and green light?They don\u2019t look lik dreamcatcher. I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is, but something about their faces looks kind of distorted? They\u2019re so much prettier irl, I don\u2019t know what happened to this album cover",
