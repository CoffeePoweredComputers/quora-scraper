            "answer_text": "You can sync your Kindle account to upto 5 devices. For example, your home laptop, office laptop, phone, Kindle 1 and Kindle 2. All these devices will have all books that are synced to your account. So, the books on Kindle 1 will be available on Kindle 2.  However, if you want to share your books to another Kindle user who has their own account, you can loan such books for 14 days. Here's how to do it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_rel_topic?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200549320 And of course, if you want to share eBooks that are not purchased from Kindle, I'd recommend using a USB cable. :) ",

If they are on the same account, all the books that could be shared are in the Archived Items on the home page. If they are not registered in the same account, it is possible to share the e-book by enabling a loan for the title. ",
