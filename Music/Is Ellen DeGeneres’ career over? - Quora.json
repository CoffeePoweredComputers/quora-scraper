            "answer_text": "As she knew it it is over . God k own she has enough money to live out 10 retirements . And she\u2019ll always be able to do some kind of tacky infomercial , but there is another way\u2026. When you have lemons , make lemonade, ie turn a disadvantage into an advantage\u2026. She hasn\u2019t worn the black hat yet , but don\u2019t shun it, embrace it . First of all she should go all Michelle Rodriguez and get a couple of DUIs . Next , date a couple a porn stars , not just any but a couple from the sleazy side of Bi porn, guys and gals both , and dye that mop jet black . Speaking of Rodriguez, she had her genes done and damn if that sassy Dominican didn\u2019t have like 25 percent African blood . Ellen could do the same , then start all jive taking \u201c Laquishwa , mu main mane my main man\u2026\u201d walk all slinky and low to da ground and shite . She could parley this thing by playing a Quintin Tarentino Villan in his next flick, opposite Dennis Rodman who she would get preggers by. I\u2019m not sayin this is gonna happen , just sayin other peeps a turned their career in a dime, look at Bruce Jenner , would u have predicted that ? She could go into her shell then BURST back in to the seen as a controversy queen , dropping L bombbs and lettin it fly \u2026 oh and she should not pin her ears back but Enhance them, go totally freak !
