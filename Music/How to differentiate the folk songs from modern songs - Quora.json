            "answer_text": "Folk songs are traditional songs of a particular culture, handed down from one generation to the next, with no clear author credited for the work.  These songs often tell a tale containing a moral lesson or they can be just for fun.  There can be many variations of the same with no actual right way to perform it.  Folk songs are usually perform on the traditional instrument of the culture they originated from.  Modern folk music can resemble traditional folk music in style and structure but these songs can be traced to definite author and a date of origin.  Many of these songs represent the modern struggles for social justice.  They are so powerful that they have become permanently imprinted onto our culture.  Pete Seger, Peter Yarrow, and Bob Dylan are examples of modern folk singers.  Their music will live on long after we are gone and sung for generations to come. ",

            "answer_text": "There are modern folk songs. Not just on a technicality, but folk the same way it's always been. Then there's modern pop. That said, in the context of history, I'd characterize modern pop music as \u201clate 20th and early 21st century acoustic/electric folk/colloquial.\u201d So basically, it's just expansion on the same formula. Easy to learn, inexpensive instruments (guitars, bass, keys) play chords to backup a lyrical singer. ",
