            "answer_text": "Pay close attention to the words: the problem asks for the \u201cpercentage difference\u201d. In order to get a difference you need to subtract two values: You always subtract the reference value (you call it \u201caccepted value\u201d) from your measurement. If your measurement is larger than your reference, you\u2019ll get a positive result; if smaller, you\u2019ll get a negative result. OK, we got the difference. How do we find \u201cpercentage difference\u201d? Percentage is really the ratio of two values, multiplied by 100. Guess what two values we\u2019ll use: One is the difference we just calculated. The other is the reference value, again. You divide the difference by your reference value, and you multiply by 100. What all this calculation does is tell you how much your measurement differs from the reference value, as a percentage of that reference value. And, if it\u2019s a positive value, your measurement is larger than the reference; if it\u2019s negative, your measurement is smaller than the reference by that percentage. OK, enough talk. Let\u2019s do one example: Get the difference: 9.97\u20139.81=0.16 Find the ratio: 0.16/9.81=0.0163 Convert to percentage: 0.0163x100=1.63 So, for your first measurement, the percentage difference from the accepted value is 1.63%. It\u2019s positive, so your measurement is larger than the accepted value, which you can also easily confirm by comparing the two. Now you can do the rest on your own. ",
