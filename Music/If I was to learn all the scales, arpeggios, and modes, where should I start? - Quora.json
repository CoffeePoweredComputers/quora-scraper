            "answer_text": "By the humble C major scale, of course, also called C Ionian mode (C D E F G A B C) Then keep the same intervals but start from D (D E F G A B C D). That's D Dorian mode. Keep going\u2026 start from the next interval (E F G A B C D E), that's E Phrigyan for you. Next\u2026 (F G A B C D E F) And here we have F Lydian See the pattern? G A B C D E F G is G Mixolidian A B C D E F G A is A Aeolian aka the natural minor scale B C D E F G A B is B Locrian Then take the root of all these modes that you now completely master around for a spin in all the 12 possible semitones and you'll know all the possible modes of any possible scale. Then you might want to get a grasp of the augmented and diminished concept, if you're still hungry for musical theory knowledge. Cheers. ",
