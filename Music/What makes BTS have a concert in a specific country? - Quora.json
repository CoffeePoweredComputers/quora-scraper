            "answer_text": "Hi, I'm gonna try to answer it bcs in college I've worked on some occasions organizing \u201cconcert\u201d and music gigs. I know it's not gonna be credentials bcs the scale is so much different but basically it's all the same. BigHit as agency will always give out the bare minimum requirements to promotors, as the one who will help BigHit to organize the concert at certain city or country, in order to guarantee that one show will run smoothly. One of it will always be the minimum amount of concert attendees. BigHit now always go for very big venue with so many numbers can attend and remember not all countries have good or proper venue let alone stadiums. And it will always go back to the promotors either they're able to fulfill this requirement or not. Promotors also need to think how they can sell out the venue. Take a sample in my country, we have giant numbers of army but promotors need to consider how many armys are willing to give out money to see concert, will this big numbers are enough to sell out stadiums? Safety of one city or country always takes count. One always have to make sure that as long as the boys stay at one country or city there will be no any incidents that endangered them and staffs. For me, these two are the main issues. What makes some countries are not yet announcing the tour dates is negotiation always take longer time bcs remember that our boys now are big stars with so many staffs, managers, dancers and also production crews who also join them in one show. Money can't be gambled here. ",
