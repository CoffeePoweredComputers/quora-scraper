            "answer_text": "There are many reasons you may be interested in learning how to teach yourself to sing. Maybe lessons are too expensive, or you are not entirely sure singing is your passion. Maybe you\u2019re embarrassed about your singing level or you feel like you are behind and want to kickstart your singing. But is it actually possible to teach yourself to sing? Yes\u2026 and no. Read on to see what we mean\u2026 You Already Sing! Singing is part of our everyday lives. It isn\u2019t like learning something completely new, such as an instrument or learning how to drive, because singing is simply an extended use of the voice. You are already halfway to singing when you speak. So, you\u2019ll want to work on the techniques of using your voice that will improve this skill you already possess. The techniques you will want to begin with include: Vocal PitchVocal PowerVocal RangeVocal Pitch Vocal pitch is one of the most important areas of singing. When you work with a vocal coach, your pitch may be one of the first things they talk about. Singing off-pitch is what causes most singers to stop singing, or listeners to think someone sounds bad. When you are learning how to teach yourself to sing, you will want to establish a good warm-up and exercise routine to help with this technique. Pitch matching \u2013 reproducing tones you hear with your voice \u2013 is probably the simplest exercise you can work on. This involves not just working with your voice, but your ear as well, as your ear is an important key to vocal pitch. All you need for simple pitch-matching exercises is a tuner, a pitch to match, and your voice. The pitch you match could be the built-in pitches in a tuner, a piano, or even a YouTube video or virtual keyboard. The best technique, however, is using a piano, because it trains your ear in the same way you would in professional lessons. Play a note, such as a C, and sing it back. This is where you will want a tuner to tell if you are truly matching pitch. Vocal Power The next step in the journey of how to teach yourself to sing is to work on your vocal power. To begin, vocal power requires proper breathing and diaphragm control. Add some breathing exercises to your daily warm-up, and pay attention to correct positioning of your jaw, mouth, and body to help with this. A lot of breathing exercises incorporate singing different sounds on pitches and working up and down the scale. Making sure you breathe from your belly and support your voice through the entire exercise is the key to power. Sequences such as \u201cMi Me Ma Mo Mu\u201d up and down the scale will give you practice in opening your mouth, relaxing your throat, and supporting your sound. You don\u2019t want these notes to sound nasal, but rather supported and steady. Vocal Range Vocal range goes hand-in-hand with vocal power. Once you get your breath support under control, you can begin exploring your range. The ability to relax your throat and support your voice will give you the power needed for the wider range in notes. There are several great range exercises to try as you\u2019re working on scales. For an example exercise, check out the video below. These exercises should be part of your warm-up before working on an actual vocal piece. Video: Recap of Pitch, Power, and Range Learn how to sing on-pitch and with power, as well as improve your range, with these extra tips and vocal exercises by online teacher Liz T.: Intro to Vocal Pitch, Power, and Range  Additional Resources There are tons of great supplemental resources on how to teach yourself to sing, from the Internet to the library to your local music programs. You can practice any of the warm-up exercises you find on YouTube, as well as match pitch through standards and common folk songs. Often you can find sheet music online or in your local library or these sorts of songs. While you can teach yourself to sing the basics with these resources, if you want to sing well, working with a vocal teacher is extremely important. Your teacher will be able to notice and correct bad habits that can lead to injuries or those that may be affecting your sound. Plus, the motivation and inspiration you can get from this type of guidance can make a huge difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer:Find the right guru (music-teacher). It's not as easy as it sounds, though :) Long answer:All the technicalities aside, every human being can sing very naturally, aesthetically pleasing or not! However, I feel there are 3 aspects to learning to sing in an aesthetically pleasing manner: (a) developing a diet (music one listens to in general) and (b) the art of imitation, (c) heart (giving it your everything when you're singing). (a) Developing your musical diet:If you like to travel, you'd know that the sound of native music changes every 100 kilometers. There are thousands of styles of music that exists, and each of these have a unique style of singing associated to it. From Hindustani classical to Tuvan throat singing, the basic definition to what's 'aesthetically pleasing' changes, and you do not need a trained ear to spot the difference in most such cases. For another example, in some styles a vibrato is 'not acceptable' and in some, it's a must. Naturally, therefore, what you listen to growing up shapes you as a singer. I feel it might help to check some of what's going around out, and in the process find your voice. A good musical diet will also help you develop a strong sense of music too! (b) The art of imitation:The idea of learning from a 'guru' is common across many cultures around the world. This usually starts at a young age because children imitate better and internalize faster. Even if one has no teacher in the formal sense of the term, almost everybody has had influences. My friend had once said, \"you're the average of the singers you cover/pick\". I kinda agree to that theory. Please note, the idea here isn't to become v2.0 of somebody else. (c) Heart:This is what finally makes you a 'singer'. Have a heart, you must! Singing is all about rendering an emotion using your voice. It might help to understand the lyrics of the song, then capture the philosophy it's trying to convey - what's the song talking about? Do you want to tell that story? If no, choose another song. If yes, you must now own the story. And you must feel the story. And that you've felt it, must be felt by the people listening to you. Watch any singer you love, see how they express while they're singing, and as mentioned earlier, try and imitate. I feel these pointers should be a nice starting point. Happy singing :) ",
