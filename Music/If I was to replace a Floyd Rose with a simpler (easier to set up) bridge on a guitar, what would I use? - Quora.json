            "answer_text": "A good Floyd Rose should be an easy to maintain, reliable tremolo as long as you understand its idiosyncrasies (like don't take off all the strings at once). However, there are a lot of \"licensed\" designs out there on budget guitars that aren't so great. Sorry to hear you're having problems. First, you might take the guitar to a reputable mom & pop luthier in your area and ask for a tune-up on the tremelo. Might cost you between $35 and $100 for his time, and he'll basically smooth and polish the hinge points on the anchors and plate, clean and lube all adjustment points, and perform a setup of the entire instrument including trem adjustments. It's often miraculous what an expert touch will do to even a mediocre-quality instrument. If you really think it's beyond saving, then I'd either look for a better quality replacement FR, or trade in the entire guitar. A Floyd Rose tremolo is practically integral to the body of the instrument; so much has to be routed out to fit the rotating bridge and its spring set that trying to put in anything else is a fool's errand. Even a hardtail mod isn't going to help sustain and tone as much as you might like, because the replacement bridge plate is going to sit over a huge hole in the guitar. If you're going to replace it, I recommend an actual Floyd Rose. They're expensive (between $200 and $300 for the Original or Pro series, about $100 for the \"Special\" series and again you get what you pay for), but the cost of anything less is about 80% licensing fees, which comes out of the available money for materials, machining and QA. So, it's worth it to get a \"real\" Floyd. ",

            "answer_text": "I get the feeling that you don't use the tremelo very often, don't enjoy the additional time it takes to change strings, or it gets in the way of your playing somehow (like sounding out-of-tune when you palm mute). I understand. I play on hard-tail/tune-o-matic equipped guitars more often than not. My suggestion to you is not to replace the bridge, but to block it off to where it can no longer move and it will act as a hard-tail does. You can do that yourself by cutting down some wood to size and installing it inside the cavity to where the tremelo ceases to move. There is also an aftermarket device called the Tremel-No. It installs inside the tremelo cavity and allows the user to choose between three settings: completely off, fully on, and down only. They are sold at Musicians Friend and the cost is comparable to what one might spend on a new bridge. If I were in your shoes I would definitely go with the Tremel-No. There may be other mechanisms available. Just do some research on-line. I noticed in a response to your question that the Tune-o-matic was suggested as a replacement solution. I implore you to disregard that suggestion because it is far from ideal in your situation. The Tune-o-matic has two pieces (think Les Paul) and it won't cover the tremelo hole. Additionally you would need to install four posts. It's just not a good idea. Whatever you decide to do, don't forget to take off the string locks. You don't really need to replace the nut unless you are getting some buzz. ",
