            "answer_text": "This question actually has two answers.  In February 1991 Queen released Innuendo.The record was sort of return to Queen\u2019s roots - A hard rock sound with complicated yet playful compositions, lots of effects, and an epic single even longer than Bohemian Rhapsody. It was their best selling album in the US in seven years. The record had some hang-ups, however; The band wanted to release the album in time for Christmas season 1990 but had to slow down their pace just a bit to accommodate Mercury\u2019s health. Speaking of his health, rumors that he now had AIDS had begun to spread leading up the album\u2019s recording. Mercury refused to comment on the matter, privately telling people he didn\u2019t want Queen\u2019s records to sell out of \u201csympathy.\u201d Nonetheless, reports swamped his home and wherever they thought he may be (read: Recording studio) in a chance to harass an answer out of him. This lead the band to flying out to Switzerland to record the album. Around the time sessions for Innuendo was wrapping up, Mercury decided to record vocals for songs which the rest of the band was supposed to complete in the event of his death, having vowed to \u201ckeep working until I fucking drop.\u201d He ended up recording vocals when his health allowed for it up until around May of that same year. He died on the 24th of November, 1991 - about nine months after the release of Innuendo.  Now it was up to the band (minus Mercury, of course) to go into the study and make songs out of the vocal takes he had left behind. The problem was that they didn\u2019t have nearly enough to make an album out of (about three of them were made into songs.) Together, with producer David Richards, the band assembled various vocal takes Mercury had recorded for solo records or, really just whatever hadn\u2019t been released on a Queen album already, and constructed different songs around them with new instrumentation they had written. That album was eventually released in late 1995 as Made in Heaven.  So which one was technically Queen\u2019s last album? If you\u2019re picky, you could argue that Made in Heaven isn\u2019t technically a \u201cproper Queen studio album\u201d and more of a Frankenstein monster. If you\u2019re not as picky you can argue that 3/4ths of Queen recording new music is still a new Queen album, even if the other 1/4th of the band\u2019s contributions to the album come from sources never intended to be used in this way - And what\u2019s more, Mercury had explicitly told the band to basically do something like this after his death. Which side is right? Which album is Queen\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d album? That\u2019s for you to decide. ",
