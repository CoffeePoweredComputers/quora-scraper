            "answer_text": "Well there are variety of ukes around. Many varieties. Hope you know that ukuleles were supposed to be toys in past but artist like Jason marz gave the respect that it hold till date. Concerning the choosing of uke, it depends whether you're a beginner, amateur or professional. There are standard ones, concert ones, tenor and baritone. All varying in lengths and tuning methods. Over all, you should choose ukes whose neck should be made out of rosewood. And you will get two types of body for this amazing instrument. Solid wood and laminated. If you're in search of high quality long lasting ukulele, then solid wood is your destination. Laminated ones could crack and split in no time( depending on your flow to play). Two kinda shapes for you, either figure 8 or pineapple. If you find the guitar look alike uke, it's figure 8 and if you fall in love with the Hawaiian ukulele, it's the pineapple. Your choice. Best uke in standard is rogue models. Best in concert martin models. Best in tenor is nohea. And best in baritone is every Oscar models. I have electric acoustic Luna baritone and it's best in its kind. If more doubts, please lemme know. I'll help you out with farthest concern. Hope this helps! ",
