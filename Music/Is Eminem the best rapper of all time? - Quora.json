            "answer_text": "Of course he is. I could write a book on Eminem if asked to, that\u2019s how big of a stan I am. Trying to take as neutral a stand as I possibly can, EMINEM IS THE BEST RAPPER IN THE HISTORY. To honestly answer this question, let's break down the different components of rap. We can divide it in rhyming, punch lines, multis, metaphors, wordplay, references and FREESTYLE. OK so that's the written aspect or the technical aspects of rap. Then comes the performance part that includes delivery and flow. Hoping I'm not missing anything, let's rate Eminem using these parameters. If you actually listen to Eminem, you can easily tell that he is the best with rhyming. Like he can literally rhyme any two words. Punch lines, ugh.. He doesn't give a lot of punch lines in his songs but since we know that he is from an underground battle rap background as portrayed in his movie \u201c8 mile\u201d, we know he is damn good at these. He has also had pretty nice punch lines in his songs, for example, he has said some things like, \u201cMy rhyming skills got you climbing hills, i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills\"; \u201cSince the burial of Jesus, fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases\"; \"And when I'm goin' to Hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave, Ima put air in a bag and charge people to breathe\"; \"I walked into a gun fight with a knife to kill you, and cut you so fast that when your blood spilled, it was still blue\"; \"I get imaginative witha mouth full of adjectives, a brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives. Shittin' on rap\"; \"Tell Lady Gaga she can quit her job at the post office cause she's still a mail lady\"; and many more. Ok if you actually read all these, then you are pretty serious about this question and you completely understand why Eminem is the king of punchlines too. No. 4 is my personal favorite though as its kinda scientific and hits the science part inside of me lol. The only guy who can MAYBE (a very big maybe) beat Eminem at punchlines is Tupac. Ok. So moving on, Now talking about multis, multis refers to rhyming multiple syllables of different lines. So instead of like just rhyming the ending words of a line, u rhyme like the last 3 or 4 words with the last 3 or 4 words of another line. The best example and I would say the RECORD multi belongs to,\u2026you guessed it, Marshall Bruce Mathers III. I want all the readers to PROMISE me to go and listen to the second verse of \u201cStay Wide Awake\u201d by Eminem and be mesmerized by it. To cut this already long answer short, listen to any album by Eminem and you will find multiple world class examples of references, wordplay and metaphors. He absolutely kills it with the metaphors. So the performance part of the rap. Eminem is kinda like FLOW LESS that makes him FLAWLESS. Like give him any beat, and he will rap to it. Change a beat mid-track, and he will adopt and transition soo smoothly that you will wonder if he is even human. Like he actually rapped to EDM beats recently in a song titled \u201cWhy Again\u201d ft. The Weekend. When a guy does that, you just have to give him the title of THE RAP GOD. Freestyle is an art that only a few rappers have been able to master over the years and Eminem is one of the best at it. It requires constant brainstorming, practice and a huge vocabulary. Eminem reads the dictionary often and thus, has almost all the words at his disposal when freestyling. This makes his freestyles unique all the time and even more impressive. So concluding it, EMINEM lacks NO skill that a legendary rapper must have and is the best at most of these traits. It's TALENT + HARDWORK. Coz even though he failed Grade 9 multiple times, he was always good at English. So Eminem indeed is THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!! ",

            "answer_text": "YES TECHNICAL RAP Eminem is certainly the greatest technical rapper to ever touch the mic. His multis, metaphors, and wordplays are just out of this world. He may not be the best at each of those indvidually but he was certainly one of the best in all those categories. Rappers like Royce da 5\u20329\u2033, Nas, Biggie Smalls, Canibus, and more recently: Joyner Lucas and Kendrick Lamar, come close but not quite like what Eminem does. STORYTELLING Storytelling is a very important (if not THE MOST) aspect of any art, and Eminem excels at it. Eminem has had a rough life. His father left him and his mother at a very young age, he was bullied throughout school life, his mother was an abusive one and also had a drug addiction, he had a love-hate with his wife Kim, he struggled to raise his daughter Hailey due to poverty before his success and also his relationship with her mother Kim. He has also been sued several times by people including his mother, and wife. All this added fuel to his rage and made his stories much more interesting. Many argue that Tupac was a much better storyteller but I feel that\u2019s a biased answer as Tupac\u2019s songs were relatable to black people living in poverty and facing racism everyday, whereas Eminem had a much more personal to which most people cannot relate but the way he told his stories was way better than Tupac. Tupac was more direct and real, while Eminem is more imaginative. He usually conveys his messages through fictitious incidents and even when he narrates real incidents he adds a few imaginative lines just for the sake of rhyming and entertainment. At the peak of his career, Eminem was struggling with dangerous amounts of drug abuse and even almost died once. The drugs may have made his imagination more violent and creative so he owes some of success to drugs. BEEFS It is almost impossible for humans to not develop a rivalry with other humans during the course of their lifetime. The same is seen in the hip hop industry as well. Beefs have played a major role in influencing the industry. Eminem started his career as a battle rapper, plus, he is the GOAT so he always has an advantage in beefs. But most importantly, he has already stated his weaknesses in his songs so his weaknesses cant be exploited anymore. Some careers Eminem has ended with his diss tracks: Mariah CareyNick CannonBenzinoJa RuleJessica SimpsonCanibusEminem doesn\u2019t even respond to diss tracks unless it\u2019s about his daughter(and bringing a man\u2019s family into a rivalry isn\u2019t a very manly thing to do, so that\u2019s an instant loss) Some other important beefs: JayZ-Nas, Tupac-Biggie Smalls, etc. SALES Souce: Forbe\u2019s article Over the course of the last twenty years, Eminem has established himself as one of the biggest selling artists in both hip-hop and music at large. Eminem is the highest selling hip hop artist and 2nd highest across all genres. He now has 107.5 million certified units, surpassing the pop star likes of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to become the second-most successful singles act in RIAA history. Mathers reached this career milestone with new certifications for fan favorites like \"Kill You\" and \"Stan,\" as well as fresh multi-platinum nods for previously awarded singles including \"Without Me\" and \"The Real Slim Shady.\" So with all that said, Eminem is THE GREATEST TO EVER TOUCH THE MIC.
