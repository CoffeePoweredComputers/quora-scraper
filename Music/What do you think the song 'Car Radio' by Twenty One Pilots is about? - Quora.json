            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is actually a lot simpler than one might think. Tyler Joseph wrote the song about the theft of his Car Radio and the aftermath. He is an emotional person, and was struggling a lot mentally at the time. Without music to drown out his thoughts, the silence forced him to face the things that scared him. He has stated, however that it helped him in the end, and he thinks everyone should take time to sit in silence and think once in a while. Source: There is a Commentary on Twenty \u00d8ne Pil\u00f8ts\u2019 album Vessel on Spotify. In it Tyler Joseph shares a lot of cool information about his songs, including Car Radio. I highly recommend you give it a listen. ",

            "answer_text": "Car Radio is about needing a distraction from your mind. When Tyler ( the singer) talks about the car radio, he\u2019s literally talking about a car radio, or just music in general. He says \u201dsomebody stole my car radio and now I just sit in silence.\u201d He is talking about the absence of sound and distractions. It\u2019s about how being left with your mind and thoughts is dangerous. He doesn\u2019t want to look into his feelings and think about all the bad things in life. If avoiding that means suppressing feelings and ignoring things in your life, then it\u2019s worth it because of the pain that thinking brings. The hopeless confusion of your mind and the seemingly endless torture of self hate is arisen without distractions. This line in specific illustrates what the song is about fairly clearly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we know why were here. Oh my too deep please stop thinking. I liked it better when my car had sound.\u201d He starts thinking dark thoughts and then catches himself and desperately wants something to take his mind off of these thoughts. ",
