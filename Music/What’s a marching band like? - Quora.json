            "answer_text": "A high school marching band is an extra curricular activity that most band students will take part in. As a member of a marching band myself(percussionist), we always accompany the football team to games where we perform our show at halftime. A marching show is essentially music that is added to a drill design to create a dynamic performance on the field. These shows often take months of rehearsal and work to create as we performers need to learn both the drill and the music. There is also the competitive aspect of marching band that most people overlook. There are many invitationals and championships that marching bands across the United States participate in to showcase the show that we spend months trying to perfect. The most prestigious of these is the Bands of America Grand Nationals which is held in Indianapolis each year. A marching band will only perform its show during the fall season and will retire indoors for the concert season for the rest of the year. Thanks for reading! If you have any questions regarding the particulars of a marching band whether it be about the show design, rehearsals, the musical aspect, the visual aspect or anything in general feel free to ask in the comments.

            "answer_text": "It honestly depends on the size of your marching band I feel like, but I've noticed that every marching band I've seen or heard about has had a family-like presence throughout the season. Let me explain. The 2017 season of marching band was my first year as a sophomore and I was in colorguard, despite any stereotypes, our colorguard was pretty close with the band, as most of the people in guard are or have friends who are in band. During band camp, we have no stress from school or other obligations, as we'd spend 11+ hours together at practice every day of August. Through this time, we learn music, how to march/spin, we do fun team building activities and games such as spirit week and pool parties at night, and we become close as if we are family. When the school year starts we'd have practice after school 3\u20134 days of the week depending on if there was a home game. Now, this may seem like a lot of hours and a lot of commitment, but in marching band, no matter how much you may complain about heat or time, you always end up coming back again, year after year. Here, we create lifelong friendships with students of all ages, teaching younger students, learning from older students, and joking around together. And from the amazing love and support we have in my area from marching band, we have grown big and gotten far. Here is our first place state championship video, build with love, hard work, sweat, and tears, this show was created for us by our band director and instructors, built by us, and will never be performed ever again.
