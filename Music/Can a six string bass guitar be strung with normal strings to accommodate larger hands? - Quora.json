            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming, after reading some answers here that by \u201cnormal\u201d strings you mean regular guitar strings strung on a six string bass because you want to play a regular guitar but feel like your hands are too big. The idea would be to have an instrument with a longer scale and wider string spacing to accommodate your particular hands. After 20+ years of teaching guitar and seeing many hands and fingers up close, I would say that there is a certain small percentage of people who have hands entirely unsuitable for standard guitars. I would also suggest that if you\u2019re seeing a violinist or some other instrumentalist playing successfully, you\u2019re seeing a person whose hands are suitable (at least close enough) for their instrument and they\u2019re not playing pieces their hands can\u2019t perform. You\u2019re not seeing the number of people who didn\u2019t make it, gave up or switched to another instrument because of hand issues. So, the people I have seen with hands unsuitable for regular guitars include: hands that are massive- it\u2019s not so much the hand size that\u2019s a problem but fingertip thickness and string spacing. The fingers are too thick to be positioned so that adjacent strings can ring clearly. My dad is one of these people- he can play limited things on a classical guitar but his hands are actually ideal for bass guitar. My mother has slender fingers so I got a combination of big hands with slender fingers. I also got a \u201cshort\u201d pinky which causes me some problems. It\u2019s not really short but rather set lower on my hand.Fingernails that can\u2019t be cut short enough. Some people have nails that when cut as short as possible they still stick out past the fingertip. This creates enormous difficulty for the left hand (fretting hand). A scalloped fretboard might be a solution as well as bass guitar if the hands are big enough. Bass strings are thick enough that some extra nail length won\u2019t interfere so much with the left hand.Also, I took lessons with Peppino D\u2019Agostino years ago and he was touring with Seagull steel string guitars. I asked why he used that instrument and he told me it was because they made the string spacing wider than normal and that was the only guitar he could play with his \u201cfat fingers\u201d. The thing about guitars is that buying guitars is kind of like buying clothes- manufacturers make instruments that are sized to be close for fitting a majority of the population. People on the extremes of that range have difficulty. Ideally, instruments would be custom made to fit a person\u2019s particular hands. I\u2019ve done this myself- my pinky finger is set a little low on my hand and my middle and ring fingers are long, making it difficult to do some things in the higher register on my classical guitar. I had a guitar hand built by Thomas Humphrey because his standard design for classical guitar has the neck raised above the fingerboard, making it easier to reach the higher registers. His guitar is a much better fit for my particular hands. There\u2019s things I play on that guitar that are much easier than on a standard concert guitar and there are things I can play on a cutaway guitar that are easier than those. While I like your creative idea, stringing a six string bass with regular guitar strings will be problematic. The scale length is much longer on a bass, it may need a new nut to fit the smaller sized strings and it won\u2019t really play like a guitar. It may be worth trying though you\u2019d have to figure out what tuning the strings will allow. If I were you, I\u2019d do a few things. Check with a guitar teacher to make sure your hands really are too big and that you\u2019re not making some other error making the problem worse (posture, hand position, how you hold the guitar etc). Have he teacher also check the guitar\u2019s setup as the setup has a big influence on how guitars play. Try some existing options for guitars as guitars do come in various scale lengths etc. Baritone guitars are bigger but still feel more like a guitar than a bass. They are tuned lower, which means you\u2019ll have to take that into account depending on the music you\u2019re playing. If none of that works, I\u2019d look into getting a custom instrument. It\u2019s possible that a slightly longer scale length with wider string spacing may work for you. The problem with this is a custom instrument will cost more and you won\u2019t be able to try it before hand. There may be a luthier who has experience with this and can measure your hands and maybe give you some specific advice based on those measurements. The other option is to just switch to bass- you may find that you like bass a lot. You could get a bass like a six string or seven string which would give you more strings for soloing in a higher register. Consider that good bass players are always in demand on the music scene. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with several answers below, but agree that overall the bass restring is not a good idea. In addition to tuners and the like, one would have to replace the nut and bridge to accommodate skinnier strings and variation in scale length that compensates for different tensions. Also, the pick-ups are designed for a different frequency range. Using a bass with different strings does not mess up the pitch intervals. On a standard guitar, each fret going up is in the same ratio to the remaining length of the string as the next fret. The ratios apply to all scale lengths including kiddie, regular, baritone, and bass guitars. As an example for string fatness, changing from DR Drop-Down heavy strings to Ernie Ball Super Slinkys does not change the pitch intervals. Some guitarists do have very big hands. Terry Kath from Chicago (RIP) had large hands, but sure could roll through those jazzy arpeggios. Just listen to the intro to \u201cQuestions 67 and 68\u201d. While you\u2019re at it take note of the rich full bass tone that Peter Cetera produced. I\u2019m told that Andy Summers of the Police would use wide chord frettings (that few others could reach) on purpose so his stuff would be difficult to replicate. Form the chords that Summers picks in \u201cI\u2019ll Be Watching You\u201d (at least I had trouble with it). Just work with that guitar you have. It will pay you back. A baritone, as suggested, might be an idea. ",

            "answer_text": "First, even large hands would find a bass guitar scale length too large for guitar playing. The frets are too wide to make barre chords and certain shapes too difficult than they should be. What I\u2019m saying is that one should instead practice on the instrument regardless of the hand size relative to the fretboard. Ukulele and violin players don\u2019t have issues with it, and others shouldn\u2019t as well. Theoretically though, no. Guitar strings are typically too short to actually reach the pegs. If they do, there\u2019s not enough string to wind them. Add to that the problem of the actual tuners. They have different gear ratios to guitar machine heads. Unless you find a suitable replacement which will most likely involve rigging or replacing the headstock, tuning the strings would present problems instead. Add to that the increased tension on the strings. Because of the scale length, one would need to tune up a string with more tension, which can become uncomfortable. If one wants to find a longer scale length to work with, then a baritone guitar might be suitable. It is tuned lower than a guitar due to its length, but it does provide wider frets. The only catch is, if you wanted to play in the register of the guitar, you would have to access upper frets anyway, negating the advantages of wider frets. ",

Maybe you\u2019re asking if you can throw acoustic guitar strings on a bass guitar. In that case, you\u2019d be a pioneer. Normal strings doesn\u2019t confirm any kind of musical instrument string.
