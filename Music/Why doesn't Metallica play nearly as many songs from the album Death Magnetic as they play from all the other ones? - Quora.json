            "answer_text": "Metallica concerts are usually filled with fans that are about the same age as the band onstage. That is to say that most Metallica fans have been Metallica fans since the old days and as such, when they go to a Metallica show they want to hear the classics and the old repertoire. Metallica just simply hasn\u2019t released any solid albums after the Black Album and their concert setlists show that the band believes this too. They plug the new album that they\u2019ve just released by playing a few songs from it and then it\u2019s back to the classics for the rest of the show. Just buy Megadeth tickets instead. They\u2019re cheaper and the band can still play. ",

            "answer_text": "They know it was a pretty weak album, and there apparently is not much fun pressure to play songs from that album. Audiences for bands like Metallica come for the great classics, some deep album tracks from the classic albums and they tolerate some new songs of the current album. Nobody comes to a live show for the songs from the \u2018filler\u2019 albums. ",
