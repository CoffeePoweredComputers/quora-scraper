            "answer_text": "I have purchased lots of guitars from GC and yes they do some setup work. A student luthier made me an archtop guitar but it sure needed neck and fretwork to be playable. He works for GC now. I have spent as much as $200 to have a Guild Guitar neck with a complete fret and neck job. It would have been at least $300 or more if I went to an instrument store. I do not know if GC is yet in that level of work. Yes the neck on my 1990 Guild brand new was so far off I quit playing it until a couple of years ago. At the time I purchased my two guilds 1987 and 1990, there were some changes going on in the guitar industry. Both Guilds have show stopping good looks and were made with an arched back to eliminate additional bracing and project sound better. Unfortunately Guild quit making this remarkable model. Schmitt Music was so impressed when I ordered the 12 string in 1987, that they immediately started selling guild guitars in their stores. However that was decades ago and alot has changed. Today, most guitars need neck work to get them to play at a pro level at least acoustic ones. Around 2\u20133K they come pretty much close to the money. In the China made 500\u2013700 dollar range most are going to require some neck work to get them into the pro playing range. On many guitars I have owned I purchase a new nut and saddle and spend hours getting them adjusted to play. However if the neck is twisted and the frets need adjusting well that can only be performed by a luthier cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they do. Or at least, the ones in my region do. (They have dedicated techs, btw\u2014it's not the salespeople you see on the floor who are doing the work.)Cost, obviously, depends on the work you need done and the area of the country you're in. Talk to them. They'll let you know how much before they do the work.I loved their communication in advance, and I loved the work I had done on my electric, so I'd call it good. But you're probably not going to my GC, so that's not likely to be too relevant for you.IIRC they had some sort of guarantee on the work, too.As you would with any work being done anywhere on anything, make sure you talk to them in advance and feel comfortable with the way they do business. My only reservation about Guitar Center would be if your guitar is extremely valuable\u2014then you might want to take it to someone who's a specialist rather than affordably-priced generalists, which is probably what you'll find at your GC.

I have no idea how well trained they are (I knew one of them 2 years ago, but he\u2019s gone), and I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot. My first choice for anything serious would be to go to a local guy with a good rep. For just a bridge adjustment, or new nut or saddle, maybe I\u2019d take a flyer on them. Cost tends to be on the low end of the spectrum, I believe. ",

Anything beyond that, they\u2019d yet take it but will send your guitar off to a luthier they have a deal with. When I called, they told me that. Luckily I found out a friend, and excellent guitarist, was also a trained luthier. I got to him for all things guitar. ",

The work is generally not as good as a \u201creal tech.\u201d Guitar Center\u2019s techs are minimally trained and do a lot of learning on-the-job. GC will back up their work to a degree, but it takes a long time, and the results will rarely be as good as a reputable local technician or luthier. ",
