            "answer_text": "It sets you free\u2026 Not clear enough? I will elaborate\u2026 You are a regular joe going through the grind of life earning your daily bread or learning to eventually do the same. Your actions have all fallen into neat patterns which define the directions and flow of your life just like a mud embankment guides the water channel. You eat the same food, wear the same clothes meet the same people day in and out and continue to do so afraid of upsetting the status quo. The unfamiliar and the uncertain are often scarier than the listlessness and moroseness that come with such bland regularity\u2026. It is at this point that you need a break. A release valve. An escape. The ususal means are not available to you. You cant go for that trekking you had planned because the car is in the garage (Or your friends are too busy right now). You cant go out for too long because you cant stay away for too long (You have been there. You know it). There is not even a good movie out there. And there is nothing on TV (when is the next sesaon of GOT coming???) For you the easiest option would be to go on a pizza binge and watch youtube videos till you weep with desperation\u2026or\u2026 You can try listening to music\u2026. You lie down in your room with the curtains closed. Your eyes shut off from the world and ears trained on the music being played on the Music systems speaker (Or you can use headphone as well, whatever works for you). In a hummingbird\u2019s heartbeat you are transported to a dusty field in rajasthan surrounded by people looking expectantly towards the sky (Ghanan ghanan from Lagaan), Into a helicopter flying over fileds of paddy and an M60 in your hand (Ride of the Valkyriee, Apocallypse now), In the foothills of himalayas (Yeah haseen vadiyaan, Roja) and so on and so forth\u2026 It is that release that frees you from your earthly worries and pains completely even if only for a moment. What\u2019s your favorite song to escape to? ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't been asked this question ever even though I roam about the city confessing my love for it. So I'll try to write this one as I think. For those who love to listen: It's like my gateway to a just and fair place. I listen only what I want to listen. What gives me peace and happiness. It's one of the few things I do for myself, without caring about the judging eyes and ears of someone. Like when I'm low, I listen to old Hindi songs to remind me of the better times, happier times. It gives me strength to look for the silver lining in every cloud. When I'm angry, I listen to the loudest possible tracks and my mind calms down because I realize a noisy you will only find noise in anything anyone says. You need to be calm to find music in the noise around you. When I'm happy, I listen to classical music that make me appreciate my achievement even more, and yet keep me grounded. This is one sphere of my life that I own and no one and where I don't need anyone else but me. For those who love to Sing: I can't put to words the joy it brings listening to your own voice taking the roller coaster ride across all the scales and pitches. Sometimes I sing like no one is watching or listening. I'll hum my own tune, even dance to it. Just to feel free. Sometimes I sing when everything in life is falling apart and I feel good for nothing. In those moments I know this is the one thing I can never go wrong with. It gives me immense confidence. Sometimes I sing to make others happy, like the ones I love. That's probably the only time I get appreciated too :D But it's the smile on their faces that's my reward. And well sometimes, I just SING without reason. For me, it's the Beatbox to my life. My heart may forget to beat someday but I'll never forget the rhythm to which it did:) ",
