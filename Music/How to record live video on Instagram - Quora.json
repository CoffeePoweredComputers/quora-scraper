            "answer_text": "Hi there! Isn\u2019t it amazing that Instagram has now also caught the live broadcast fever and just rolled out their own? That\u2019s two thumbs-up from me for this visual content-loving platform because the option for more direct interaction has just gotten more exciting! Yey! To use the new Live Instagram feature, you just start by tapping Your Story or the camera icon on your insta screen. After that, you can choose between several recording formats such as Normal--for regular photo or video, Boomerang--a GIF-style composed of different photos that goes on a loop, and also Live that broadcasts on a realtime manner but also disappears the moment you stop--this is the one you are looking for based on your question. Before you tap Start Live Video, check your setting first and make sure you have enabled some options such as hiding the live video from specific people or if you are allowing direct messages or comments. Then tap Done once you are satisfied and then Start Live Video. Live broadcast is limited to one hour only. Just like with Facebook, the moment your broadcast starts, your friends who are online will be notified that you have a live video going. With the settings you have chosen, you will be able to receive hearts and comments from those who are watching and appreciating your live video, you can also directly interact with them by commenting back or acknowledging their comments. To maximize your live broadcast, make sure to mention the purpose and importance of your video and what you are doing it for since others might tune in late. Promote your live video a few days before the date you are going live to get the attention of more audience so they can fit your live session into their schedule and listen uninterrupted.
