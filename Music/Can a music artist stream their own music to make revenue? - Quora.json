Most also contain \u201ccontrolled composition\u201d clauses, which exercise a similar control over the composition. If there aren\u2019t any contracts, certainly the artist could build software to stream it to other people. Otherwise the label can issue DMCA takedown notices if it chooses. ",

You can add audio ads, but will people stay then? So, again, you \u201ccan\u201d stream but whether people will pay may depend on hundreds of different things. ",
