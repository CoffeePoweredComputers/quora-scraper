            "answer_text": "It is important to know what happiness really is .  According to Bhagvat Gita there are three types of happiness Sattwik happiness (Happiness in mode of goodness)  When we try to take the name of God or follow his orders, initially it is full of struggle but when we attach to God then it is like nectar. Sattwik happiness is achieved when we gain Knowledge of the divine. Rajasic happiness (Happiness in mode of passion)  When we attach to material things , initially it gives us pleasure like nectar but end is like poison cuz everything gets separated from us in the end. If you want to get rid of this type of sorrow that arise from Rajasik happiness then stop getting attached to material things slowly and steadily . Tamasic happiness (Happiness in mode of ignorance) \u201cThat happiness which both in the beginning and afterwards deludes the self, arising from sleep, indolence, and negligence, is declared to be tamasic\u201d (18:39). Krishna describes tamasic happiness \u2013deluding, addicting, and confusing\u2013arising from sleep, idleness and outright laziness , negligence and confusion .  Krishna says ,\u201cFirst reach to sattwik guna by keep remembering me and eventually you will cross satvik guna too , just by thinking of me, you will reach transcendental stage which is above three gu\u1e47as.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "One can convert sorrows to happiness through the realization of the Truth. When you realize the Truth, that you are the manifestation of the Divine, there is no sorrow. Sorrow disappears, the triple suffering, physical suffering of the body, misery of the mind and agony of the ego, it all just disappears, because you realize that all this is transitory, this is not the reality, the reality is something else. Suffering is the projection, and because we live as the body, as the Mind and Ego, the ME, we suffer. The moment we realize we are not this, we are that, we are the Divine Soul, all suffering is converted to bliss, eternal joy and everlasting peace. But as long as we don't realize the Truth, as long as we aren\u2019t enlightened with the Truth, we will continue to suffer. ",
