            "answer_text": "Annyeong~ Blackpink has 2 sides and an improved version of 2ne1 , i guess thats y. But just because they are amazing doesn\u2019t mean they are the most succesful. Ofc, thats BTS but then there are the nations gg and bg , EXO and TWICE. They always use a formula that has an EDM based beat which is catchy and cool, their merch is also nice. Their songs are always or mostly a bop and get tons of views by starving blinks. THATS ALL Have a bacon  bye~ ",

            "answer_text": "Nice Question! First of all the group has amazing members. Also all the members are beautiful. They were from the incredible YG entertainment where G-Dragon, iKON, BigBang, Yang Hyun-suk, Treasure, 2NE1, CL, PSL, Teddy Park. There entertainment has a lot of really good artists. Blackpink is also in the YG family which has a lot of artists of YG counting G-Dragon! They are also really good because dduddudu has 1.3B viewers and they\u2019re youtube channel has over 50M Subs or more or less I could be wrong. Last but not least they are all really nice. ",
