            "answer_text": "It\u2019d be Wanna One. I might be biased, but until now, there are no rookie that could do it big like Wanna One. Coming from survival show Produce 101 Season 2, 11 boys formed into one group and promoting for 1,5 years in contract. Each of them has their own appeal, and each of them has big fandom to combine. Each are talented in their own way, and I am so proud to call myself as a Wannable. Here is some fact about Wanna One\u2019s debut: They debuted in August 7th, 2017 in Gocheok Sky Dome, holding an audience for approximately 20.000+ fans. It\u2019s still the biggest debut showcase in the K-Pop industry (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, though).They are the first K-Pop group that holds 100M views for their debut MV on Youtube (see Energetic). Nu\u2019est is following behind with almost 100M now (as in 23 April 2019) for their Face MV.They won 15 times for Energetic, their song debut. No one holds that record.They actually held a record for fastest win in music show before, but now it\u2019s been hold by another rookie group (Itzy, I think?)They did a full world-tour (not just a showcase) in the span of 1,5 years of promoting. No rookies did that.This is probably biased too, but people from Twitter are saying that you could not escape from Wanna One. They are on TV. They are on the CF. You see their cardboard on stores. You see their banner in streets. You see their ad in subway, in buses. You see them on product packaging. They\u2019re literally everywhere, as a national boy group. And for that, I am really proud of Wanna One. ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite debuts were BlackpinkTwiceItzyCherry bulletGfriend(Yes I'm a gg stan) Blackpink Omg I loved their songs so much! I just didn't expect this sound. Their dances were amazing and different, really awesome and badass with a little bit of sexy. I loved the powerful sound of boombayah and the calm butsassy sound in whistle and to this day these are still 2 of my all time fav songs. (This was also the first debut I was actually hyped for ever since leaving the kpop fandom in 2014. Blackpink was also the group that got me back into kpop with this debut so yehh) Twice Even tho I wasn't there when they debuted, I did watch sixteen afterwards. To this day i still adore this song and it is one of the best debut songs ever in my opinion. I liked the concept, I liked the mv, loved the styling and adored Momo's blond hair. They really gave every member a chance go shine and I loved that. Itzy Maybe this is just me but I loved their concept. The cute and different side bit all of a sudden there is this rap part that sounds very girlcrush to me. The choreo was amazing and they were so synchronised, like how?? I also loved their vocals and rap. The most beautiful part for me however was the mv. The colourful mv completely represented their personality and the sound of the song! Cherry bullet I actually clicked on their mv by accident but the song was so catchy! I started googling them and they had just debuted ! I was surprised because they sounded so good and experienced to me. After watching Q&A I immidetly downloaded every song they had and flowed them ever since. Gfriend omg, I stan them. They are amazing. Their sound is so differed and beautiful. I love classical music and pop and this is the perfect mix. Their vocals are so good, but then you realise this is a group which focuses on dance! Omg I loved their debut and still listen to that song everyday! It's still one of my favs. Stan Gfriend ",
