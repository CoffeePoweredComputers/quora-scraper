            "answer_text": "He actually sang and he\u2019s not bad by any stretch of the imagination, just restrained and polite. He sings like someone who\u2019s studied a bit and does it for fun - pitch and rhythm are good, but style, tone, and projection are a bit lacking and his range isn\u2019t fully developed. He sings well enough to carry the scenes when he\u2019s singing so it isn\u2019t anywhere near the kind of awkward-to-watch let down like when actors do a bad job of faking an instrument If you listen to a trained operatic tenor you can hear the clear difference it makes to spend years honing the technique to be able to project over an entire orchestra in a 2000 seat hall and do it musically. In some episodes they enhanced Picardo\u2019s singing to make it sound fuller and more extroverted than it was, but his sound and style are both generally pretty cautious. Here\u2019s an example using the same piece: listen to them one after another then listen to them both a second time Jussi Bjorling  Robert Picardo  Picardo\u2019s no slouch but he doesn\u2019t have the zing, musicality, or diction that trained operatic tenors have. He\u2019s also more of a baritone than a tenor. The piece is in B major, but he sings it down a 3rd in G major because he doesn\u2019t have the range for the actual piece. You can actually hear near at about 1:12 that his voice starts to give out on a high E but he covers it well. If he had a more full operatic sound and handled the cadenza, ending on a high B (or G in his version) after sedating Tuvok it would have been icing on the cake ",
