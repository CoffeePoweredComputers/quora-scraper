            "answer_text": "One of my favorite songs right now, and has been for some time, is Things Behind the Sun by Nick Drake. Nick Drake is an English guitar and singer-songwriter who had relatively no public appearances or knowledge about him before he died early on in his life. The lyrics of the song are not only perfectly written and beautiful, but are truly thought-provoking. Here are the lyrics: Please beware of them that stare They'll only smile to see you while Your time away And once you've seen what they have been To win the earth just won't seem worth Your night or your day Who'll hear what I say. Look around you find the ground Is not so far from where you are But not too wise For down below they never grow They're always tired and charms are hired From out of their eyes Never surprise. Take your time and you'll be fine And say a prayer for people there Who live on the floor And if you see what's meant to be Don't name the day or try to say It happened before. Don't be shy you learn to fly And see the sun when day is done If only you see Just what you are beneath a star That came to stay one rainy day In autumn for free Yes, be what you'll be. Please beware of them that stare They'll only smile to see you while Your time away And once you've seen what they have been To win the earth just won't seem worth Your night or your day Who'll hear what I say. Open up the broken cup Let goodly sin and sunshine in Yes that's today. And open wide the hymns you hide You find renown while people frown At things that you say But say what you'll say About the farmers and the fun And the things behind the sun And the people around your head Who say everything's been said And the movement in your brain Sends you out into the rain. These lyrics perfectly encapsulate the reclusive life of Nick Drake and, in a way, explain the emotions he must have been feeling at the time. The music is simple yet sublime, with only a guitar and voice. The song is minor in key the entire time, until the very end when it turns to major key. This shift in mood perfectly symbolizes the life of Nick Drake. He suffered from major depression throughout his life and retreated from the public eye. He refused to be interviewed or play live, and never found great commercial success in his lifetime. He died at the age of 26 due to a suicidal drug overdose. However, his music gradually became more appreciated after his death to the point where there are documentaries and biographies being released about him today. His life was grim for quite a while, but ended with a happy conclusion and continues to be appreciated today. This song carries so much meaning and I love listening to it. Nick Drake  ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I like \"Jessica\" by Major Lazer and Ezra Koenig at the moment.  The lyrics indicate a person who is in lopic with a person named Jessica, yet that's on the surface. Fake German words, the usage of a Porsche as a bathing suit dryer, and the ignoring of a \"mother crying upstairs\" gives an odd, yet intriguing character who could be interpreted in many ways indeed.  Also, the music is very unconventional; it's a combination of rock, reggae, and electronic (but not electronic dance), and its tempo is slow but loping, making its instrumental as intriguing as the lyrics. And yes, it sounds great too! ",
