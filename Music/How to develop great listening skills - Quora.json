            "answer_text": "By learning to shut up really . Because when we actually shut up we tend to actually\u2026listen. Here's a list. When someone wants to speak to you you should remove all distractions. Put your phone away, turn off the the tv, close the book you're reading, etc. Why? Because this shows you're actually going to give them your full undivided attention and that's the first big step of listening. Those who are decent observers will even take notice of this and appreciate it as it shows real effort on your part to actually listen.Fix your body language. What I mean here is certain body language looks bad because it's indicative typically of feelings of apathy and boredom with what the speaker is saying. So you first of all, turn your entire body towards them, not just your upper body, your whole body, this shows even more so you're giving full attention. Next you show open body language. This means you show body language that shows you're friendly, approachable etc. This is done by not crossing your arms or legs, moving in closer to the speaker especially when they're telling you something very important. Keeping eye contact and blinking so it looks like you're \u201chome\u201d, and slightly tilting your head to either side as it shows deeper fascination with what the speaker is saying. Nodding at the right times is also important.Don\u2019t you ever interrupt when it's not your turn to speak unless it's an emergency or you have to go. The emergency will rarely come so you will have to use this principal a lot. Nothing turns off people more when they're cut off or have their sentences finished. Even I have trouble sometimes not finishing people sentences even though I'm right most of the time. Here's a rule, wait 2\u20133 seconds after the last thing they said to finally know it's your turn to speak. First no one will really notice the few seconds you were quite so trust me you'll be fine t won't be weird. Also some great listeners say to use the 2\u20133 seconds to give a facial reaction to what tehy just said expressing a mood when their last sentence. It's really up to you but I follow the facial expression followed by what I'm going to say back.Ask to clarify what they just said and follow it up by good feedback. So this is where it's a tad harder for people because it requires a bit more than just sitting there and thinking a bit and actually demonstrating you've listen. So for example let's say your friend Carl has been telling you about his dogs and his new tricks he's teaching him sonit goes like this. Carl- yeah I'm so excited tomorrow I'm gonna teach him to finally catch. You- from what you've been telling me he seems kkke a smart dog he\u2019ll probably learn it in no time. Carl- I know! I wonder what else I could teach him besides the basics. Me- You should look it up if you really are curious and what other basics have you taught him? Cause he could be so good he's could enter competitions. Carl-You're so right I think my dog would be top 3. But I've taught him how to sit and bark when taking orders. You see how I was saying made sense as it pertained to what was coming out his mouth what's even better is when you ask questions to show how active you're in the listening.Make the entire conversation about them, ask questions of who, what, where, when, how. This is done to make the person really talk so then you can do the listening. People love talking about themselves and the person who asks the questions has the power in the conversation. Asking who, what where etc can't be answered with a simple yes or no which is why they're better for conversations and listening.Just because people want you to listen doesn't mean they want your advice. I learn this one the hard way due. Point is, lots of people simply want to be heard, they want to feel like someone cares about their problems enough to listen to them but this doesn't always mean they want to hear you advice if what they're speaking about sounds like a topic they need advice in. Why? Many consider it condescending or annoying because they never ask for it. That's what's key here, don't ever offer advice unless it's understood tacitly to or they explicitly ask you. More so the latter. Being explicitly asked is always the best sign to give advice otherwise you probably shouldn't whem actually trying to listen to others. Some would appreciate the advice even if they didn't ask but those who really want it will more likely ask for it explicitly.Don\u2019t judge or criticize them. Seriously this a big no no. The better you apply the rules the more people will open up faster and they'll tell you many times deep, personal stuff. I've been told about miscarriages, rape, really juicy gossip, insecurities etc. When people tell you this stuff, feel lucky because odds are you're one of the few who know this about them even if you don't agree with it or you think it's nit as bad (their situation) just listen to them. If you attack people while you're listening it's a quick way to get them to get resentful and stop talking even if you do everything else right, it's just no one likes to be judged especially if they're revealing a lot because they've lowered their guard and are being vulnerable so please dont criticize in any way unless asked for some constructive criticism.Other things include use good time and reassure others that their secrets are safe with you or that you enjoyed listening (even if you didn't).  I know it sounds like a lot but trust me it becomes second nature to do all this the more you practice. being a good listener is a good skill to have as you can open people up and connect on a deeper level and those will find you more charming and charismatic as well.

            "answer_text": "I read somewhere that Listening is \u2018 Wanting to hear\u2019 . I thought it to be the most succinct definition of listening. So focus on finding a reason to \u2018want to hear\u2019 and you will automatically become a good listener. Notice how crowds throng to hear preachers, motivational speakers and stand up comedians. The motivation the audience has is \u2018wanting to hear\u2019. To enhance your listening experience and to get the most out of what you hear, form the following habits: Where ever possible, when listening make jottings of a sentence, an example, a thought that captures your imagination. You can always review it later and capture the essence of what you listened to. Be careful not to make elaborate notes or you will miss out on important points being made by the speaker.Mentally summarize the key point that a speaker is making. Paying attention to the example or joke made by the speaker would be easier to recall and based on that you can often recall the point being illustrated.Suspend judgment when listening. Do not let our bias, our prejudices and/ or our differences with the speaker clutter our listening. If we listen with intent only to rebutt, we would possibly miss out on listening to some valid arguments of the speaker. It is also possible that we hear only what we want to hear and not listen to the speaker from his/ her perspective.Responding to the speaker is a motivator to listen more. Response comes in the form of eye contact (not staring), smiles (not smirk), non verbal clues (like a nod, clapping, thumbs up ). Remember that even if the speaker may be biased in his / her viewpoint being expressed, very rarely are they completely wrong.Attend with a mindset of an explorer not that of a prisoner. If you attend a lecture because you need the attendance, you are prisoner of the lecture. However, if you tell yourself that with no choice left, let me explore what the lecture has to offer, you will definitely find something meaningful and relevant in the lecture.Focus on \u2018wanting to hear\u2019 and then adopt the above habits and you will become a very good listener.

            "answer_text": "Practical Steps For More Effective Listening 1. Talk less  One of my students used to say that when she facilitated classes she always told her students that God gave you one mouth and two ears \u2013 that should tell you something. 2. Get rid of distractions  If it is important for you to listen, do everything you can to eliminate internal and external noise and distractions that interfere with careful listening. 3. Don\u2019t judge prematurely  All of us are guilty of forming snap judgements and evaluating others before hearing them out especially when the speaker\u2019s ideas conflict with our own. 4. Look for key ideas  We think much faster than people speak. To help focus attention (rather then drift off in boredom) extract the central idea. 5. Ask sincere questions  \u2018Devil\u2019s advocate\u2019 questions are really statements or criticisms in disguise. Sincere questions are requests for new information that clarifies a speaker\u2019s thoughts or feelings. 6. Paraphrase  Reword the speaker\u2019s thoughts in your own words to make sure your interpretation as a listener is accurate. 7. Suspend your own agenda  In other words, while you are listening, concentrate on what the speaker is saying not what you think. 8. Empathic listening  Empathic listening is knowing that given the same set of circumstances you might have done the same thing. It is the ability to experience the world from the other\u2019s point of view. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you agree, but that you understand. 9. Open your heart with love  Often we listen to score points and make ourselves right and the other person wrong. When we open our hearts to each other, we do so with the belief that we are all the same. We have the same feelings, fears, and hurts: doing the best we can with what we know.

People who have a habbit of interrupting are generally the ones who don\u2019t have listening skills. They want to stop others and want themselves to be the center of attention as quickly as possible and which is where they fall off.If you don\u2019t have a habbit of giving equal importance to the other person, then listening skill might not come to you easily. So, think about it!Collect your thoughts, don\u2019t be impatient and wait for your chance to speak.",

            "answer_text": "May I presume that your question relates to listening as part of your interpersonal skills? As in any form of auditory participation it is important that your input channel is undisturbed. Beyond the mere absence of external noise it requires to silence your internal dialogue (or chatter). Furthermore it is paramount that your intention to really listen is pure. That means you are fully committed to fully grasp what the other person is expressing. Sometimes people pay only limited attention whilst they are already thinking of their next sentence. A good way to practise is \u201ccontrolled dialogue\u201d where you paraphrase the other person\u2019s message until he or she is fully satisfied that you perceived the message without mixing it with your own intentions. Keep practising and good luck ! ",

(I came to understand that when someone is saying something wrong, we feel the urge to interrupt and correct him/her, but that can wait till he/her has finished talking).. Also, instead of just sitting and staring at the person, or into open space while he/she talks on, you can give nods or sighs, this will help to let the person know that you are actually listening and also help you to listen more and be interested..

Interrupting the conversation is rude and disrespectful. (3) Appreciate the speaker When the conversation ends, take a few minutes to appreciate them. This shows that you enjoyed speaking to him/her.
