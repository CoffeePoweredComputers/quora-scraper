            "answer_text": "You have a few routes to go here. Two possible pathways could be: Make an appointment with your PRO rep. If you don't have a PRO (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) then get yourself setup. Take a collection of your work to your rep and if they think you'll be a good fit with a publisher, they could help you get to know them. Your publisher could be a gate-keeper to licensing your music with other artists/performers. Research music libraries, sync or publishing houses that have placed music like yours in TV, Film or Advertising. Put a collection of your music together and send an email or call them up. Lots of these companies take online submissions. Many others can really only be approached once you know them. No one has the best route for you. Those are just a couple of suggestions to get you thinking about your options. Many times, these relationships happen more organically though. Play shows in your town, network with other musicians, always be supportive of your scene and work to become sharpened by it. Becoming excellent amonst your peers and respected by them, cool things are more likely to come your way than an anonymous subscription. Good luck! ",
