            "answer_text": "First of all, try to think of mixing as a software independent exercise. Essentially, when you learn to mix you should be able to replicate it on any system. I'm guessing that you have an instrumental track that is compressed to hell. If that's the case you will need edit the vocals and then to match the compression and then adjust level. Then balance with eq. You can add some effects: a touch of reverb and delay. Experiment with other effects but don't over do it.  Note: I assuming you have some knowledge of where the effects are and how to add them remove them etc. Editing: involves removing unwanted sounds before or after important lyrics and also creative arrangements.Compression: If mixing with a highly compressed instrument track use a compressor with a fast attack <=10ms/11ms for rap vocals something slower for slow sung vocals between 20ms and 50ms adjust makeup gain and threshold to affect the amount of compression EQ: is based on the type of vocals; deep voice, mid tone or high compared to the instrumentation. Remove all frequencies below 70-100 Hz the reason for this is unless it's a bass instrument it's virtually useless and can cause muddiness the hallmark of the amateur sound, Also deEss basically controlling the \"s\" sound and \"tch\". Also makes sure to control the highs frequency try a gentle roll off at about 10-15kHz. Experiment with mid frequencies you may boost 1-2kHz to create a roomy sounding vocal also boosting 3-5kHz (only if you recorded in very dampened room/booth) If not you may want to cut the 3-5Hz, Depending on the vocal deep; you want to control the lower end 250-500Hz. Generally, experiment alot with eq until you achieve balance. Effects: Delay and Reverb are the most common types of effects. Start with these first. Send the compressed and Eqed vocal track to a Bus channel with a Reverb on it then adjust the return to optimal level. This is a taste thing. Same with Delay experiment with the amount of delay slow 1/2-1/4 to fast 1/8-1/32 etc. If the whole send and return is confusing just render the compressed and Eqed vocal track alone and import it to a separate track with only Reverb or delay and adjust the levels (it has exactly the same result as send & return). You can have multiple of these tracks but generally their volume is going to be low.Also don't hesitate to pan from Left to Right the effect tracks just make sure the overall track is balanced (not to Left or Right heavy) As you experiment you will learn lots of stuff but know that you can do this on any other system; Protools, Reason, Ableton, Big consoles with outboard gear. The principles are the same.

            "answer_text": "As often the case with Quora questions, a very broad request! There is no rule book on these things, when voices and the tracks they are used on vary so much, as do the results the mixer is trying to create. Most people would say you need eq and compression as insert effects on the track. Reverb is also useful, but don't overdo it except as a deliberate effect. Try a compression ratio between 2:1 and 4:1 and tweak the threshold to see how that feels.You can't talk about specific frequencies, but play with the upper mids to bring out what sits with the track or cut anything that grates.Try changing the order you have the eq and compression in. You can drag the plugins up and down the strip. When you have a combination that works, you can click on the channel setting button and save it.If you have a lead vocal that will work best centred, though doubles can be panned.I suspect that many rap vocals these days have minimal reverb. Try using a small room or ambience setting, on a low send, to keep the vocals up front. Many people do not know that you can get impulse files of different reverbs to load into Space Designer in Logic, including from top studio hardware such as Lexicon or Bricasti. Do a google search for \u2018download free impulse response files\u2019 and you'll find loads of useful stuff which can help your mixes.Do t forget that automation of levels can really help emphasise words or phrases at specific points in the song. Likewise you can automate reverb or delay sends.",
