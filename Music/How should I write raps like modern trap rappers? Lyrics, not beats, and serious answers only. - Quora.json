You can pick any content and make a trap song from it. Learn the Triplets This is the biggest component of any Trap song. What are Triplets? Basically all classical rap lyrics go like this. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..rhyme\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026rhyme snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare The Triplet flow goes like this. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026rhyme\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 rhyme\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026rhyme\u2026..(yeah!) snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..snare Ad-libs Once you write your lyrics with Triplets and flow you will notice a lot of empty spaces i.e the gap in your flow. You should fill it up with ad-libs that hype your song up. These sound especially good on a Trap Beat. Hook This is the part that will make or break a Trap song. Finding the right melody for the hook part of the song is extremely important. Try to hum a melody while the beat plays and keep fitting words and phrases to your melody. Finding the right melody does need a good ear and some talent however the beat will usually carry you if you come up with a half-decent melody. There you go. Drop a link in the comments if you get around to recording and putting your song on Youtube. Good luck. ",
