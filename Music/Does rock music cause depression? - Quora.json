            "answer_text": "Rock music is depressing, by design, for a number of reasons, many of which your unconscious is unable to ignore. It's culturally appropriated art that's watered down to be sold to kids by industry. Its subject matter is usually something hinting at depth but representing it poorly (eg relationships, drugs, politics). Its artists are usually terrible people interested in making money and garnering fame. Basically, rock music is the same thing as actors talking about politics: nonsense. Nonsense that you know society accepts as common knowledge. It is depressing. Rock music is as close to supporting a cartel as many kids will ever get; rock music is the product that represents the misplaced artistic aspirations of generations. Rock music is how the system trains kids to become consumers, ie adults that don't know how to play by any rules except the system's. Imagine a world where everyone with a message purposely obfuscates the words with organized noise, in order for the aesthetics, the medium, to become the message, the content. That's rock music, and it's literally auditory fascism. If you're listening, it's for you. (Taken from a comment below) Rock and pop music (they are the same, no I don't make the rules) are the equivalents of Hollywood movies. They are products, designed to sell more products. (If you don't believe me, replace \u201crock\u201d with \u201ccountry\u201d and take note of how suddenly you agree with the exact same argument) When the first android phones came out, Eric Clapton and Fender teamed up to make the most Rock 'n Roll phone ever, IIRC it was one of the first to have a dedicated Facebook button on it. Something that's artistic is made to say something, and something that's pornographic is made to sell something. Most popular music (of which rock is a category) is made to sell stuff. That's why it's put in easy to parse categories, purely so people don't go hearing things they weren't ready for. Heck, music and Hollywood both cannibalize themselves. Look, I could go on all day. Just look up culture industry and pop music. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a paper on this in undergrad (actually on aggression and violence, not depression). I\u2019m sure I would die laughing if I read it now, though the theme I was finding among research on the subject is that it can increase aggression in people who AREN\u2019T fans of it, on the other hand, in fans of metal, it either has no effect on aggression and arousal or even has a diminishing effect (it soothes). One citation\u2014there are more if you want to look around (google scholar is an easy option): William Neil Gowensmith, Larry J. Bloom; The Effects of Heavy Metal Music on Arousal and Anger, Journal of Music Therapy, Volume 34, Issue 1, 1 March 1997, Pages 33\u201345 I was a depressed teenager. Metal music was an outlet. Definitely only helped as far as I can tell. In fact, it inspired me to learn to play the electric guitar, and eventually I moved into classical guitar as well. These are skills I may not have picked up otherwise and which I pride myself on today. I think people who are depressed may seek this type of music out because the themes are relatable. Also, I have found metalheads to be, overall, very friendly and accepting people. This isn\u2019t universal of course. But for some, the community provides a network of support and camaraderie. I still listen to very hardcore metal music, including bands which sing about the most gruesome things imaginable (granted, I don\u2019t typically listen to the lyrics), I am generally not overly depressed, and certainly not aggressive, violent, or whatever negative trait people associate with it.

Because if you are listening to loud music it might start making you angry and frustrated.. You might like it in starting but once you listen to it regularly, it comes in your daily life and you are over energised and then that energy is supposed to be taken out somewhere..

Take Coldplay and Green Day for example. Both Coldplay and Green Day are consider to be Rock, but they are both very different. Coldplay is more alternative rock, with electronic sounds and upbeat melodies. Green Day has mostly stuck to the basic guitar, bass, drum formula and have a more punk sound. What I'm trying to say is, it's probably not Rock that makes you depressed, but a sub genre of it. I would suggest listening to a some other genre of Rock and see if you feel the same. ",
