            "answer_text": "She was famous when she was alive. That fame contributed to her death, in a way. Her success brought her celebrity, which stimulated her drug use and desires to emulate her heroes. She loved jazz. Some of her heroes overdosed. Eventually Amy Winehouse's abuse of drugs, culture, celebrity, romance, and sex ended with an overdose. She was an exceptional musician prior to her death. She was an accomplished musician, not just a vocalist. She played guitar, chose chords and melody structure, wrote lyrics, arranged, and performed. Had she not overdosed I awould have continued to follow her musical evolution. Unlike a lot of pop, she wrote with depth, authenticity, and vulgarity that others shyed away from. Her acclaim likely would have grown. Her catalog may have received more attention after her death but it was a matter of catching up to her talent, more than being undeserved. Consider that Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain all died young after making a mark on the musical world \u2013 that mark was created before death, and took time to propogate to its full influence. They were all deserving of their influence, regardless of death. ",

            "answer_text": "I seriously wish she never came to exist. Because of her fame, her music came to be the emblem of poor taste. I listened to her in my time and by my judgement, though she may not be in my top 10 favourite singers, she had talent.The point is that nowadays women who think they can sing always try and do her songs.Now I am not against people trying but then you have to comprehend why things as such can just lead someone to cringe, cringe, cringe. It\u2019s sad really. The skill that comes from someone from her caliber can never be done justice by most female vocalists, perhaps because A) they think that since she doesn\u2019t have a high tone, then her songs are just perfect; B)because if you don\u2019t then you are nobody.Simply put, when an artist becomes famous they inspire people to render an homage to her/him, good and bad alike.It may be that her style is just unique and it can\u2019t be broken down into definite factors as to why she was successful. We can\u2019t know.All I do know is that sometimes covers sound like a sorry excuse of an imitation which makes you wonder why anyone liked her in the first place. Perhaps this was what you meant when you asked why she is/was so famous?Or not\u2026(If someone argues that I haven\u2019t really looked out there for any decent covers I actually would like it if he/she posts a link with a nice cover :-) ",
