You can create a video with this background music before uploading to Instagram. To avoid need to create content by yourself, you can download and use content under various types of creative commons licenses: Videos - Creative Commons It is also reasonable to adapt this video formats to Instagram platform formats - because they uses very different (square and vertical) formats as compared to TV or Youtube. So, it is better to reformat that output video into portrait (vertical) orientation before uploading it to Instagram The easiest way to do this is using online tools. For example, Tappable Vertical Video Maker - Crop & Blur Videos To Fit Social Media is a free tool that converts horizontal video content into a vertical one. 1080X1080, 1080x1350 (4:5), 1080x1920 (9:16) vertical video formats are supported for output.It is mostly focused on content creators and videographers to create better video content for Instagram and IGTV.
