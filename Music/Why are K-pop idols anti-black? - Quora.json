            "answer_text": " Well just to clarify from the start, I highly doubt Kpop is anti-black. Seeing from the aforementioned article photo above, black aesthetic, culture, and style has somehow taken up on Kpop aesthetics. Whether they\u2019re appropriated or appreciated is not known unless the stylist or idol was personally interviewed on their knowledge on the black accessory or terms used in their concepts. That being said, Kpop is far from being anti-black. They\u2019re much more fascinated with it than weirded out. Of course like any place else, there\u2019s always going to be more xenophobic citizens and people, or isolationists that are in South Korea, but it\u2019s not hated at all. A lot of the styles used in Kpop songs and raps, hairstyle and costumes are influenced by African American culture\u2026take hip-hop, dreads, box braids. These and many more have been used.     Again whether these are appropriation or appreciation we\u2019ll never truly know unless we ask the artist and stylist about it. But this shows that kpop is not anti-black. Even South Korea in general is not anti-black. Today there are many Blacks who have a residence in South Korea, and they get by well. You also have to understand that South Koreans aren\u2019t used to seeing foreigners so to them a foreign person would be considered as somewhat of a shock to them, but they wouldn\u2019t ever directly disrespect the culture or color. They\u2019re still getting used to it and in 2020 it\u2019s gotten so much better.  I bet you all would know this very popular dance studio in South Korea that holds a very popular YouTube channel with over 15 million subscribers. The reason I\u2019m mentioning this is because from the very start their music and dances were influenced by black artists and African Americans all over the world. They even invited black dancers and choreographers to join them in sessions.                all these songs were sung and rapped by black legends, 1 Million dance studio had prominently started off with hip hop dances and songs, but later evolved into many diverse genres and music to resonate with each type of dance. It became open to many cultures then. This is like the pattern Kpop and Korea went through. so in the end, kpop is not anti-black. Though there will always be xenophobia in every country, the majority over kpop and South Korea has a certain respect and interest in Black culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Most idols are definitely not anti black. The same way black ppl can seem \u2018anti-asian' cuz of jokes or ignorance but arent intentionally racist, kpop idols can also be ignorant asf. But there are numerous of idols who openly admire black culture and black people. Rm from bts for example has said ignorant comments like using \u201cblack voice\"but it's the way he speaks and his experience with hiphop yet he openly says he credits black OG artists and american /western media for certain things like friends sitcom. Many idols just need to be told once to not do certain jokes and they understand. They dont make comments to be hurtful, many arent exposed to black culture enough and go by what the media says. Also the music that trends alot is hiphop and hiphop artists are mostly black, so koreans also pick up what they hear in the music. Blacks and the western culture are stereotypical too towards asians but when asians and blacks come together they admire and respect each other. There are idols who are racist and antiblack though. Not everyone is simply naive. There are idols who are secretly hateful or prejudice. But for the most part I can say that many koreans say the newer generation is more openminded than the older generations. But it doesn't mean koreans seniors are all racist or rude towards foreigners. Now the whole cultural appropriation in kpop does get out of hand. Many just follow what their labels or stylists come up with though. ",
