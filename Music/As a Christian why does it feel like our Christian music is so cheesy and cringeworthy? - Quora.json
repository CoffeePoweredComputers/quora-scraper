            "answer_text": "If its true, its because pop is so cringe worthy. I think in order to narrow in the question itself, its necessary to get some perspective and perhaps some self-reflection: What specifically in the music are you taking issue with? What about the lyrics or the music?Can\u2019t that be said of pop music too?How much Christian music was produced last year?How much got radio play?What percentage of that are you taking issue with?Can you name 5 tracks that you are taking issue with?I feel like any critique of a genre of music is a little half-baked until one reflects on those questions or questions like them. Its just far to easy to cast stones, if you don\u2019t have any specifics, its not particularly helpful or insightful. Also, Taylor Swift it right: Haters gonna hate. Its true of lots of art and creativity. Besides, this from Need to Breathe is pretty good:  Theodore Roosevelt, also had his own version of \u201cHaters gonna hate\u201d which is this: The Man in the Arena ",

            "answer_text": "I think I can help with this question, but if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to address it from the perspective of how the music business, religion and human nature are intertwined. I\u2019d also like to go at it only addressing the \u201ccheesy and cringeworthy,\u201d styles because there\u2019s plenty of high quality Christian music on the rosters and in the archives. I get it! It\u2019s not cheesy and cringeworthy because it\u2019s Christian. Why is this a real thing, and why is it predominant in the Christian broadcast and distribution industry? Human Nature, Creativity and Creative Environments: The most creative and innovative musical personality types are very often the outliers, the ones who push the boundaries, the ones who are insatiably curious about what lies beyond the threshold of the unknown, the ones who are always reaching for more. They can often be the lonely genius types as well. None of these personality types are well suited for restrictive religious environments. Naturally, the lonely, genius types are neither attracted to nor comfortable in an intensely rich, community environment. Naturally, the outliers are not searching for a tribe, a people, or a closely knit community environment. Naturally, those who are insatiably curious about what lies beyond the unknown won\u2019t find a happy home in many churches. The questions about what lies beyond the unknown have very clear and precise answers that are expected to be agreed upon and adhered to. A high proclivity for pushing the boundaries is not a good fit for many church environments. Music and Religion: As far back as we can go, there has been music and religion and the two are intertwined. As often as not, there is a tension between the music and the faith. The inspired and revered great composers of 16th century Europe were often sponsored by a branch of the Roman Catholic Church. In those traditions, there were specific chord voicings that were permissible and others that were strictly forbidden. Major and minor triads as well as dominant seventh were permissible while extended chord voicings such as sixth, major seventh, ninth and thirteenth were strictly forbidden on the basis that they were far too sensuous and seductive. It was believed that these voicings would subliminally draw congregations into sin and out of devotion to God. In some of the Old Order Anabaptist traditions, hymns and the human voice are highly cherished while instruments of any kind are entirely forbidden. I once had a friend who was an upper middle age Old Order Mennonite. Sweetest gal you\u2019d ever want to meet. Upon learning I was a musician, Sweetest Ol\u2019 Mennonite gal told me of the most heartbreaking moment of her life. The elders of her church had decided that instruments in the home would be forbidden, so her father loaded up the family piano and took it to the pawn shop. She\u2019d grown up to love spending hours upon hours every week, playing the piano with the family gathered around, singing old hymns. It was her greatest joy in life. Gone. Sweet Ol\u2019 Mennonite gal carried the pain for the rest of her life. Sad. Renowned guitarist, singer, songwriter, Phil Keaggy, describes himself as, \u201cToo worldly for the faithful, too faithful for the worldly.\u201d Phil has spent his life\u2019s work and natural gift standing at the boundary between creative innovation and the belief system he ascribes to and promotes. Moving across the continuum, I\u2019ve seen many instances of a strained relationship between \u201cthe music and the message\u201d (the sermon). In many of these circumstances, the music is described to as the \u201cfluff, the candy,\u201d or the unfortunate necessity of serving as a \u201cdrawing card\u201d to bring people in so that they might hear the message. In one particular example, I have a close friend who is a Music Professor, Orchestra Director and very talented violinist who played voluntarily in a church worship band where the worship leader opened the service by praying that the congregation would not hear the music so they could focus solely on the message. Most in that congregation were strongly agreed with the worship leader\u2019s sentiment. My friend was deeply hurt by this event. I also know many musicians who side wholly with the worship leader in this. At the far opposite end, we see the African American Pentecostal traditions of the deep South where the music is everything. The worship band plays for hours as the congregation dances and parades around the church expressing their joy in the Lord. As a musician myself, the first time I saw one of these services, my brain silently shouted, \u201cNow THAT\u2019S my kind of church! I\u2019ll post a link at the end of this answer. Music, Church and Business: It\u2019s no secret that religion is a hotly contentious topic and music can be a somewhat contentious topic. We\u2019ve all heard about the family rule that dictates, \u201cNO politics or religion at Holiday meals.\u201d Whatever may be the money driven excesses of the Christian Music Industry (and they are certainly part of the equation as are addictions, fraud and sexual escapades), let\u2019s give \u2018em a break at least enough to say, \u201cthey gotta eat.\u201d To do that, they\u2019re between a rock and a hard place. The imperative becomes, first and foremost, how not to offend, followed by how to survive in business, followed way behind by how to create the best possible, most innovative and inspiring music as an art form. Tough call. Really tough call. So they feed us highly inoffensive \u201cfood for the soul.\u201d Baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, stewed potatoes, potato soup, potato salad, potato casserole, potato\u2019s au gratin, potato cakes, twice baked potatoes, crispy potato wedges. Oh, and not to forget a favorite popular dish, \u201cCheesy and Cringeworthy,\u201d potatoes. For their own survival, they have to draw the line on anything that might trigger \u201cfood for the soul sensitivities or allergies.\u201d If my overview has left you feeling a little vehement or glum, please enjoy this short excerpt from a worship service featuring The Campbell Brothers.

            "answer_text": "Other answers described very well the reasons that make not just Christian music, but virtually any large-scale, massified musical industry sound superficial, cheesy and facile. That\u2019s especially in the last decades, when that issue became even more pressing as access to music became increasingly popular - and pop-like -, enhancing the demand for easy, catchy, almost instinctively exciting melodies that can be rapidly consumed, discarded and replaced in a mass production system. That\u2019s not just about Christian or more broadly religious music, it\u2019s a feature of these times. However, I must say that there is no way that I think one can describe all Christian music as \u201ccheesy and cringe\u201d, especially if you consider the history of classical music since its very beginnings, which actually took place inside churches and monasteries. In fact, a disproportionately large proportion of the best pages of the history of Western music (including most of its early evolution and the creation of a technical study of music), as well as of the best musical artworks throughout the long history of classical music were deeply associated with Christian themes - and not just in the past, even nowadays some of the greatest classical pieces have been composed with some religious, more specifically Christian purpose in mind, as several works of Arvo P\u00e4rt, the genius El Ni\u00f1o of John Adams, and many others. The collection of best classical works is full of masses, oratorios, choral chants, requiems and other sacred works. Here are just two examples separated by almost 300 years, Dixit Dominus by H\u00e4ndel and the Requiem by Timothy Hamilton:   But the important role of Christian music is not just restricted to classical music. The African-American negro spirituals, as they used to be called, are almost universally about Christian religious themes and are anything but cheesy. Lyrics and melody-wise they are often very deep and captivating, musical works of real artistic value. I don\u2019t know much about other genres, but I\u2019m pretty sure that other excellent works can be found as part of the legacy of Christian-themed musical pieces.  But I honestly wouldn\u2019t expect to find them in the \u201cusual\u201d sources that most people get stuck at and think they couldn\u2019t know any better: the disposable output of a musical industry that depends increasingly on fleeting successes, things like hits, virals, instant celebrities, and so on. Dig a bit more, and you\u2019ll find a lot of Christian music that is not cheesy nor cringy. Whether it\u2019s secular or religious, sacred or profane, most of the mainstream massively popular music will probably sound a bit superficial and cheap if you put too much thought into it. Maybe you\u2019re expecting to find apples amidst the oranges. Just saying. ;-) ",

You have to identify a market and sell to it. Christian music isn\u2019t created because of some upwelling of Christian faith, it\u2019s created because Christians are willing to pay for it. Because of that, it doesn\u2019t make sense for it to contain any specific doctrinal details. It\u2019s going to be as non-denominational as they can make it. It\u2019ll be full of hearts on fire, and love for Jesus, and the feeling of being loved by the god, but it\u2019ll all be very superficial and artificially emotional. Seriously. Listen to any of it. Is there anything in there that isn\u2019t vague? Is there anything that corresponds to a specific doctrine that\u2019s unique to your flavor of Christianity? That\u2019s what the market will buy, and that\u2019s what it gets. ",

Songs are spiritual and our sensitivity to the Holy Spirit can make them seem \u2018chessy\u2019 or \u2018cringe\u2019 if we have a hardened heart, it can make us more critical of human imperfections in their art and expression. But sometimes over-hearing (hearing it too much) or trying to make songs produced or sound a certain way to fit a style, can make it \u2018cheesy\u2019 as it is done for popularity or man\u2019s \u2018sheepish\u2019 nature. It is the same with heavy metal or rap though. I used to love heavy metal music, now it just sounds \u2018cheesy\u2019 and \u2018predictable\u2019 and \u2018false angst\u2019 to try to hype up the crowd. I had a dream some years ago and Jesus sung to me. I woke up and fell from my bed to the floor weeping for 3 hours. His voice goes through you and you feel His love wash over your soul. His voice echoed and reverberated through the heaven and was perfect in sound. His words are living and you feel His words. I have never heard a song being sung on this earth that has affected me like hearing the songs that Jesus sings. Shalom ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is supposed to be worship but comes across as entertainment and like we are trying to imitate the vibe of the world. This isn\u2019t the way Christians are supposed to live. It\u2019s like we have no identity, direction and personality of our own. The singers come across as secular artists because their whole personalities are formed by sin and the world rather than God and it trumps any of the lyrics they sing- in fact it\u2019s at dissonance with the words they sing. I saw this movie called Margo who would get out and energize a crowd with his singing and preaching. Then it would show him through the week taking drugs, having sex etc. I am not saying all artists are this blatant in their sin, they in fact are probably worse, because they probably only commit socially acceptable sins like having sex with their girlfriend or drinking alcohol, which is legal etc. etc. But they think that no one can see what they are really like as people just because they are Christian singers, but who they are is more obvious than the lyrics they sing. If they were truly connected to God, their songs and music would have a completely different sound than the world. It wouldn\u2019t touch our emotion, but it would touch our soul, it wouldn\u2019t feed our flesh but would feed our faith. I personally don\u2019t experience Christian music like this. I don\u2019t mean to sound judgmental because we are all sinners, but Christ removed our sin and gave us a new spirit. It\u2019s the new spirit we should be sharing. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. At least not to me. The Christian music that is getting played these days at our parish here in a rural spot of Switzerland is neither cheesy nor cringey. It is just mostly old! And some things just cannot improved upon. Try improving Swiss Chocolate! The old works of European sacral music is something of timeless beauty. The old, traditional Catholic hymn book is still in use here, and those old hymns are actually those, which the faithful are able and willing to sing along with. Those \u201cmodern\u201d compositions all too often try to cover up their lack of beauty and ambiance with complicated arrangements and hard to sing notes. Churchgoers often wish a soothing atmosphere in Mass or service, not some \u201cupbeat\u201d tunes no one knows and you need to attend a workshop for being able to sing along. Here, at our town of 7000, our parish church of some 400 seats is packed with people to capacity and beyond twice in December, when the traditional Advent concert is being held. Mostly old music, sometimes seldom played, not all from Europe, either. A well-played pipe organ, the original baroque instruments, our local choir, reinforced with a few professional singers for the solo parts and you as a parish give some of the best Christmas presents for your community. People from all walks of life attend, even the younger crowd sets foot into the church. This is of course a superb \u201ccommercial\u201d for Midnight Mass on Dec 24th. There is nothing cheesy about those beautiful old Christmas songs, and no one is going to cringe when the whole building sings \u201cSilent Night\u201d in tune, with a candle in their hand. Some things are best left the way they are. The mere fact that something is new does not make it necessarily better, and not everything that is old is automatically outdated. Christianity by definition has a conservative trait to it. Some teachings are not going to change, while the community wants to remain Christian. There is nothing like age-old music that was played in the same way some 500 years ago to underline this timeless-ness of the Church - and God. ",

            "answer_text": "I imagine there are countless ways to answer this question, but I'll give my take. Somewhere in Christian music history, the Christian music industry must have written a policy that says, \u201cour lyrics always have to provide clear-cut answers to spiritual questions.\u201d While we can provide answers as God's people, I think many Christian songs are written like a Brady Bunch episode, where all problems are solved before the closing credits roll. It's OK to ask honest questions without providing answers in every song. Traditional worship songs can be awesome, but people also want authenticity. ",

The problem is that the world, in general, doesn\u2019t appreciate Christian music. Therefore, the budget becomes substantially smaller. Therefore, the quality becomes substantially worse. I personally think most popular Christian music is indeed cringeworthy and cheesy. There\u2019s a Blimey Cow parody of how to write a worship song that is disturbingly accurate. However, there still are artists and arrangers and writers who truly want to glorify God and write solid, meaningful, doctrine-filled music. I recommend the Pettit Team (Heart Publications), the musical groups from West Coast Baptist College and Lancaster Baptist Church, and SoundForth for incredibly meaningful, beautiful, deep and precious music.

On of my favorite new Christian songwriters is Stuart Townend (note: no \u2018s\u2019 in the last name\u2014there\u2019s an actor named Stuart TownSend.) He writes some songs that you would swear are very old hymns, with really solid theology and beautiful music. \u201cHow Deep the Father\u2019s Love for Us\u201d is a favorite of mine. There are other really good Christian artists out there. It\u2019s just a matter of sifting the proverbial chaff from the wheat, y\u2019know? ",

Also, Christian musicians are always (rightfully) fearful of being distracting or misleading. In this sense, the art must never attain the status of its subject - that would be idolatry. Hence, Christian music - even the very best, like Bach - is always unfulfilling. The insufficiency of our music-making can serve as a reminder of the greatness of its origin to which we attempt imperfectly to return it. Music always fills us with longing. It never satisfies. Not until we are included in the true source of its transcendent beauty - and that will never be in the stuff itself.  As a trumpet player, I always struggle not to cry while playing as the most profound cadence in western harmony precedes the coronation chorus. ",

Contemporary Christian pop is musically and theologically bankrupt (Trust me on this; I\u2019m trained in both) Happily, that stuff is only a small percentage of Christian sacred music. Familiarize yourself with the classic hymns (the English ones are particularly good), the great sacred choral works by Bach, Mozart, Rutter, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Faure, Duruffle, and Beethoven. Check out motets by Thomas Tallis, Palestrina, and Welliam Byrd. Listen to Gregorian chant, and American shaped note hymns. If all you\u2019ve heard is the so called \u201cpraise music\u201d favored by post Vatican II Roman Catholics, and Evangelicals, you don\u2019t even know a small fraction of the sacred musical repertoire.

As great as the music is from those eras, when I listen to it now, it's crystal clear that they focus on, and sometimes idolize, the values of the world that are the opposite of what God wants us to focus on: our lives dedicated as a sweet-smelling sacrifice to Him. With praise music, I know that the message is about God, how to live for Him, or how He empowers us to His glory. I still enjoy \u201cretro\u201d pop music from time to time, but my awoken ears don't enjoy it as they did back then when my heart was empty (because the Holy Spirit was not yet dwelling there). ",
