            "answer_text": "You can, but people wouldn't like or buy it. It would be like buying a book that's just one long run on sentence that doesn't really have a point and just rambles on. Structure allows a hook (lyrically, or melodically) to stand out. Without structure, the song wouldn't have any direction. It would be hard to perform live. It would be hard to listen to. There's nothing there to focus your attention. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. It\u2019s not advisable if you want an audience, but it\u2019s doable. Prog and/or jazz is notorious (note-orious hurhur) for throwing song structure out the window. Personally, I love those genres bc I\u2019m obsessed with polyrhythms and \u201cwtf this chord progression sounds good and theory says it shouldn\u2019t\u201d but I\u2019m also the only person I know who\u2019s into that Pop music is 3 chords played for a thousand ppl. Jazz/Prog is a thousand chords played for 3 ppl ",
