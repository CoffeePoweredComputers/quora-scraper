            "answer_text": "Cones direct sound, not amplify. Think of sound as an energy source, one that typically radiates outward in all directions. When you put a cone in front of the sound source it acts as a guide so more of that energy is sent in the direction of the cone. A cylinder acts the same way, but instead of allowing spread outward it sends the energy straight. You can demonstrate this principle with paper. Have someone speak when you stand in front but offset from center, you\u2019ll hear it but maybe not well. Add a paper rolled into a cylinder (or a cardboard tube for better results since its thicker) and you\u2019ll hear a different volume. If far enough from center it\u2019ll be quieter. Now try it with a cone and it\u2019ll be louder. Repeat with you standing center (right in line with the cylinder) you should notice that the cylinder is loudest because its more direct. ",

It merely concentrate the sound production from a normal punctual (a point) position to many concentric circles, to a concentrated region (the internal volume of the cone) which concentrate or compress the sound (else perceived as louder) hence the output thought of being amplified which is not.
