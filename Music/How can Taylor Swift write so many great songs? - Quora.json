            "answer_text": "Taylor Swift songs definitely comes from experiences she has which is a great way to relate to others. Add that she knows how to translate her emotions into a song and her lyrics really appeal to people who are struggling with the same issues. Her strength in song writing is, for the most part, relating to people who are in similar situations. Every good songwriter does have a team. That doesn't discount anything that Taylor Swift puts into a song, but it is important to suggest that a song crafted for a perfect sound is far better than someone who belts out a few words. Even though she is young, her team is solid and fans should expect that she will continue to create hit after hit.   ",

I figured I was dead anyway\u2026 \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 is actually a spectrum analysis of my personality it makes me trackable online, and it also brought my old self from 1987 back from the dead as if per a True Ressurection spell. It\u2019s what I wished for as a child, because my child personality wanted to live in an adult body in middle age because it would be \u2018different\u2019, and another adventure. Definitely is very different! My friends don\u2019t recognize me any more and my ex thinks I\u2019ve gone full delusional, and he doesn\u2019t trust or believe me at all. He says my personality has totally transformed in under a year, and he hates the independent thinking and acting woman I have become. I like my child-personality, it is significantly stronger, and I have no plans on returning to the weak, needy, and broken thing I was just a few years ago. ",
