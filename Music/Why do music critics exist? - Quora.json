            "answer_text": "When I was a lot younger I used to read the music press. I had a rule: if a record got two or more positive reviews it was almost certainly going to be worth hearing. Sometimes I would buy records on this basis and it very rarely let me down. I listened to the radio and heard friends\u2019 purchases but that wasn't always enough, because there were certain artists that wouldn't get on the radio and others that my friends hadn't heard of. This is where critics came in. In addition critics were usually enthusiasts that knew more than I did and wrote in entertaining ways about the music they, and I, loved. George Bernard Shaw is supposed to have said \u201ca critic is someone that knows the way but can't drive the car\". Well, those back seat drivers directed me to places I wouldn't have known about if I'd been left to my own devices. Critics are a good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Why does music exist? Why do people have thoughts about stuff? Why do people make judgements about the things around them? What does it mean when people value music? How does music work? What is music for? The existence of these questions are reasons for the existence of music critics.  Music critics exist because: Music exists, and;Most people don\u2019t understand it.Music critics can enlighten them. Whether they actually do or not depends on the critic, but as long as people have brains and listen to music, there will be music criticism. ",
