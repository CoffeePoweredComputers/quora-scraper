The prediction segment is called Falit Jyotish. Kundali Analysis gives us numerous speculation about ourself or about the person whose Kundali is being analyzed. In conventional Vedic Astrology there are 12 houses (Bhava) and each represents some attributions.  Mostly the Tenth house (lord of the tenth house, the planet in it, aspects of the tenth house) influences the profession of a person while the other house 2nd, 5th, 11th, are also seen for analysis. Here your question is \u201cwhat career should I choose\u201d, well there is no perfect answer I can give here, and even if someone is giving you should not believe in that.

Some positive or negative effects get canceled out by some specific combinations. So Kundali analysis is necessary. Pt.

            "answer_text": "Dear Sameer, The significance of the 10th house takes us to the realm of career and status in life. It displays fundamental possibilities. The 10th is a Kendra and as such, any planet located here will be prominent, powerful, and influential all through life. As this is an upachaya house (attributes that grow with time and effort), any possibility indicated by an occupying planet will grow in strength as life progresses. This in effect also gives great strength in overcoming all kinds of obstacles. The house indicates our ambition, status, profession, father, fame, recognition, foreign travels or affairs, political power, authority and many others. But very importantly, it signifies our determination, self-reliance and patience. The 10th house reveals holy pilgrimages, as well as good and charitable deeds, compassion, etc. Father's reputation is also signified by this house. A strong 10th house will give the person a position of power in career and fame. Different planets may fare in a very unique manner in this house, irrespective of their lordship. Let us see how they fare and how it affects our career or 10 th house significations in general. I will start with the Sun, as it is the most important of all planets. The Sun is a great planet, but it is a natural malefic. All malefics thrive in an 'upachaya' house so by the virtue of this tendency, Sun does well when located in the 10th house. Sun in the 10th house is an excellent placement for career and the person may get success in all undertakings. The Sun is the significator of the 10th and hence gets digbala, or directional strength, when located here. Astrologers often conclude that it is its best position in the horoscope. The person is career-minded and easily rises to a position of authority in his chosen profession. Fame and popularity are associated with this signature and these yield great power. As Sun aspects the 4th house, there may be difficulties in relationship with the mother due to this, but wealth is favoured and a beneficial relationship with the father, who may be wealthy and prosperous, is also indicated.Moon is a neutral planet but it is a beneficial planet as well. Its location and aspect produce calming and soothing effect always. When Moon is located in the 10th house, career matters are highly enhanced. If the waxing Moon is in the 10th house, the person is very fortunate as the significations of both the Moon and the 10th house flourish. The person is sure to enjoy fame and success from a very young age. Moon's location in the 10th house induces the person to love his/ her profession and to be sincere and diligent in efforts.Mars is natural malefic like the Sun and Saturn. The 10th house is one of the few houses that utilize this fiery energy of Mars to good effect. Mars gets digbala or directional strength in the 10th , often making this its best placement in the horoscope. The person is efficient and enjoys success and achievement all through life. The person is highly ambitious and may wish to be a ruler of some sort. Mars aspect on the 4th house may indicate ups and downs in relationship with mother and some amount of unrest in the domestic scenario. But overall, this is a fine location for Mars and makes the person 'a go getter' in his/ her profession.Mercury is a natural benefic and if Mercury is in the 10th house, the person has a successful career and a good reputation. The person has the capacity to earn plenty of wealth. It is necessary to consider the aspects to Mercury - alone and un-aspected in the 10th . If this is true, it can indicate great intellect and involvement in a career connected with communications. Mercury rules commerce and trade, so this placement can mean a very successful person in business. Mercury's aspect on the 4th house indicates a fine education and happiness at home. The person also enjoys fine conveyances and all kinds of comforts and luxuries; a good relationship with mother and benefits from her are well indicated as well.When Jupiter is in the 10th house, the person will enjoy a successful career and will know his purpose right from a very young age. His or her professional activities will succeed almost immediately, and there will be honor and fame. The person may also choose a career, which greatly benefits the public. He or she will especially be attracted to work involving higher knowledge. Jupiter is known as the great benefic and even when it is the lord of inauspicious houses, its location and aspect produce some good somewhere; just as there is some unfavorable hidden in Saturn's blessings.Venus is a natural benefic and like the Moon, it has its wonderful attributes. Its energy is beautiful and its placement in the 10th house makes the person bring joy and happiness to the public and all his or her associates. This is one of the most common placements of successful actors, artists, musicians, and performers. It is also found in the horoscopes of people who make their living selling jewelry, photography, cosmetics, sweets, arts and crafts, fine cars, and other such luxuries. The person enjoys great popularity and has a natural flair for making wealth. The person is lucky in life and makes many lucky contacts with people through his/ her profession. The person is happy and content, as Venus is powerful and prominent in this Kendra, throwing its benefic aspect onto the 4th house. The person gains great wealth and enjoys fine cars and conveyances.Saturn is a natural malefic and is greatly feared by most. When Saturn is in the 10th house, the person normally possesses great ambition, leadership ability and power. However, Saturn in any kendra gives major ups and downs in life and therefore, career successes may fluctuate. The benefits of this malefic's location in the 10th house has its benefits too, though. Saturn in the 10th gives the tendency of leadership and a highly disciplined approach to one's profession. However, the rest of the horoscope should be analyzed to confirm whether a leadership position is likely or not. Otherwise, the person's work may be connected with construction, mining, or any career involving manual labor, like steel, iron, coal, etc. Saturn's aspect on the 4th house is not good and may affect relationships with mother and also cause domestic unrest and sometimes native education is also affected.Rahu is a malefic but the 10th house is one of the finest placements for Rahu. The person is likely to have a powerful and renowned career. Career will flourish most if the person is connected with the masses. Many politicians have this placement. Influencing the masses or selling to the public is the key note of this placement. As Rahu essentially generates ambition, the person may live with insatiable career ambitions, changing career many times. If other houses and planets placements of the horoscope are harmonious, the person's work and effort greatly benefit society. The person will easily reach a position of authority. Money power comes early in life and may help support parents.Ketu is also a malefic and is a profound energy of the unknown. Because malefics in upachaya houses produce good results, Ketu in the 10th gives excellent career success. But generally career is out of the ordinary. The sign placement is also very important as Ketu may cause problems if it is in an inimical sign. In such a case, the person could experience strange difficulties in career. The most common of the troubles caused by Ketu is enmity from unknown and behind-the-scene activities against the person in terms of his/ her career. This can become very troublesome in the career path as well as the person's general success and happiness.When considering matters related to the 10th house, one must never forget that success relates to the status the person is born with. A very good 10th house in a pauper's horoscope may not mean that he/ she will attain royal status - it indicates a status that is better than that of a pauper. But with malefic or Martian attributes, the person may even turn dictator and overthrow the government. There are some subtle significances that must also be understood before any conclusive significance to this house can be attached . The religious philosophy of a man is dharma and dharma without any significance or connection to karma is empty. The 10th house astrologically suggests the fruitification of the 9th house. Dharma must set a certain Karma without which it would be an empty profession, devoid of any significance. It is for this reason that we find planet connections between the 9th, 10th or Ascendant. The 9th and 10th create Raj jog. They are connections that can turn a pauper into a king or a sceptic into a great guru. When we consider the career aspect, it is not only just one or two houses that can be analyzed for a perfect picture. Career is connected with finance, vocation and ultimately, gains and self- satisfaction. If we just consider the 10th house for career, or the 6th house for service, or the 11th house for gains, or the 2nd house for conserved wealth, the analysis will remain half-hearted and incomplete. All the four have to be considered together and analyzed for just how well they are adjusted with each other's planetary energies. Then alone will the true essence emerge! Thank You ",

Therefore, concluding one single profession of a person is not possible. Still, we have concluded a few points which must be considered while finding the profession. Before heading to Vedic astrology, first find out about the following things: Choices of professions as per the education background or skillsChoices of professionals as per family background or hereditaryNow are some Vedic astrology based points which all the astrologers keep in mind: Look for Artha Trine which is 2-6-10 to know the strength of career in one\u2019s horoscope.Study strength of 6th house in comparison with 10th. If 10th is stronger then the person will have an independent business and if not then he will stay in a job.Look for planets that are related to 6th, 10th house and Saturn. The choice of career will be related with the planet.Study the strength of 10th, Sun, Moon and Saturn. Their strength will be directly proportional to the growth in power and position of the native.Determine relationship with 4th, 9th and 10th.",

There are some sction of astrolgers who consider the 6th for employment and the 10th house for entrpreneurship. Actually it becomes very difficult to pin point the vocation, as there are many types of professions. Going by the basic rules and significations, Jupiter for example, may indicate a profession related to teaching, or priestship, primarily. But, it seldom happens that only a single planet is empowered to deicde what job the native does. In fact, this happens for almost every aspect of the native\u2019s life, as planets, seldom act single.The stronger of the plantes, that is giving imapct on the house concerned or on the planet concerned may give the clue to the vocation of the native. Here, commonsence and the socal conditions also paly a very vital role. ",
