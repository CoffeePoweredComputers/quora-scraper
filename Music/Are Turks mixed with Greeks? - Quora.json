            "answer_text": "I guess, yes. Well, since I am a Turkish guy, I wondered our genetic resemblance with surrounding countries and made a research, the result I saw was something I expected. Our genetic resemblance with Creteans are %80, whereas a bit lower with Greece and interestingly South Italy. But Turkish genetic resemblance with Armenians, Persians and Syrians are high as well. Though the highest is Cretans, Greeks and Armenians. The resemblance with Italians are above %60 so this shows that Turks got Greek a bit. Since we knew from the history, MesoSouth Italia was inhabitated by Ancient Greeks once, that's the only explanation we could find in TurkoItalian similarity. And Eastern Anatolians share the gene of its neighbours. Armenians was already largely existent until 1920 in Eastern Anatolia and Kurdish are the mix of PersoArmenian race so maybe this high percentage is stemming from them. ",

For centuries Turks have spread to many regions and established relations with the peoples there beacuse of this many Turks in Turkey dont look like totally Turanid but still they have highly that genes also if you look carefully most Turk have Turanid phenotypes still. also check how this phenotype looks ;Turanid race - Wikipedia it is already Caucasian phenotype having Mongoloid admixtures.

The people who now identify themselves as Greek or Turkish were, about 950 years ago, all either \u201cGreek\u201d or Armenian. The reason I say \u201cGreek\u201d rather than Greek is that until very recently the people we call Greek were actually Roman (and are still to an extent called that in Turkey). Two thousand years before that that the peopleof those regions were Achaean, Doric, Phrygian, Bithynian, Hittite, Hurrian, Mittani and more besides.

So it is no surprise that our genetics are similar.Adding to pt 3, Ottomans ruled Anatolia / Turkey, Greece & the Balkans for centuries. They liked mixing, migrating people inside the empire for whatever reasons. Which all things considered mixed the genetics even further.

Both religions do not accept to be same religion so Krishnamurti was right in saying that religion is the basic factor that separates man from man, if we put Jesus Christ in the game as a religion maker and not as the Son of God which He is. So a Greek as an anti-Turk Christian, that means a sinner, and a Turk is an Atheist. ",
