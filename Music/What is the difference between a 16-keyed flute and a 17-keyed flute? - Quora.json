            "answer_text": "There are basically two different kinds of modern flutes (besides the alto and bass flutes), those with a C foot and those with a B foot. The C foot looks like this:   (Image by stevendepolo on Flickr\u2014CC licensed) http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevendepolo/3830814124/ Notice it has three keys that can open or close three tone holes (two tone holes are facing the camera, and one is on the other side). All student models and a few professional models use a C foot.  Professional models usually use a B foot, which is a bit longer and can play a low B. (Obviously!) It contains an extra tone hole and key to close it, but often there is an extra gizmo key. The gizmo allows only the B tone hole to close (instead of the C and B tone holes together) which is meant to help the fourth-octave C speak easier.   (Image by Guillaume Laurent on Flickr\u2014CC licensed) http://www.flickr.com/photos/glaurent/5355032689/ So if my count is correct, flutes with a C foot have 15 keys, and those with a B foot have 16 (or 17 in you count the gizmo key).

            "answer_text": "Both are Boehm flutes, one with a an extra B key. I disagree that a B extension versus a C extension affects the general sound; however, there are some avant garde effects that one can do with the B-foot (17 hole). The sound of the flute is 95% a result of the player's embouchure and technique. At the highest levels, a few percentage points are gained by playing a Powell or Haynes rather than an Armstrong. True tone difference comes to the fore when one plays a traverso one-keyed conical bored instrument made of wood, as opposed to the metal Boehm flute. To hear Bach or Telemann played on the baroque one-keyed flute is to be awakened to this difference. ",
