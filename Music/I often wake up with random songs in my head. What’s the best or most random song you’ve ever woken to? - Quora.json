Whatever channel i fell asleep to at night would turn to infomercial sometime early in the morning. After a week of the Ninja blender commercials, one morning I woke up and just had to have one. I almost never buy stuff from infomercials, and i didn't even cook at the time. it is a really nice blender though. ",
