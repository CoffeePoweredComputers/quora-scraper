            "answer_text": "The best Ibanez electric guitars, are the ones that fit your style, both sound and playability-wise. I'm particular about playability, so after years of buying different Ibanez models, the Steve Vai autograph JEM 7V is the best Ibanez guitar for me, up to date, for Rock-related material. The S models are good for playability as well, and they're extremely light for mahogany. Herman Li's EGEN18 is probably the best of the S models. It's definitely the most expensive. For Jazz, the GB10 and GB200 Jazz hollow bodies are the best, though I like the GB200 a little more (I have both). It's a full sized jazz box that's a little more resonant than the GB10. It seems slightly easier to play, IMO. It takes YEARS of trial and error to find the \u201cbest Ibanez electric guitar.\u201d Even then, something else might pop up and rock your world all over again. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Whichever model fits your style best. But if you have the budget for one, buy a Prestige japan-made model, they are certainly worth the price hike. I have 2 Prestige RGs and a J-Custom RG, and even if the J-Custom is arguably nicer and has even better attention to detail, I don't know if the price hike is really worth it if you buy it in America or Europe, prices are tipically over-inflated because it's grey market. But just in case, if you happen to travel to Japan, I'd definitely suggest that you look for a nice J-Custom. The prices are incredible there, and if you present it at customs saying you're a pro musician and that it's your personal instrument when you get back, and don't forget to take any price tags and invoices out of the case, they very probably won't ask you anything further. That's what I did, by the way, and I'm very happy I did, but if they ask you direct questions DON'T LIE, the fine isn't worth it, and your fraud attempt might be on file forever. Cheers. ",
