            "answer_text": "There\u2019s been quite a few similar type of questions about rhythm and how we do or don\u2019t react to it. My answer thus reflects how I see/feel the reason. Everything that has a heartbeat has a rhythm, but it varies. So also(I presume) these carriers of heartbeats have bodies and minds that by default strive to be in equilibrium in some way. Inside with mind, body and soul. Outside with whatever is the surroundings. Things that are in sync works. There needs to be a balance. Too much or too little of anything leads to a problem or uncomfortable situation. Mostly you\u2019ll find yourself having a specific liking of music/rhythm which your body craves to move to. I cannot get myself to move to music which is not of a certain style/rhythm. We just want to be part(be it in movement) of what our bodies and minds(even souls) perceive to be in pace with. It feels good, it\u2019s natural. It\u2019s needed. ",

            "answer_text": "You got it backwards. Humans found out that certain rythms and sounds make them move, and they called that music. Why do some sounds make us move? Probably because the sounds evolved as a mating ritual. Whoever could dance was fit and strong. Humans evolved the ability to dance because their ancestors that could dance got laid a lot more than those who didn't. ",
