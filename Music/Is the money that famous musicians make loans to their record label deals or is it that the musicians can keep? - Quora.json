            "answer_text": "Hi there, You\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense...for the artist. The lion\u2019s share of deals are not very artist friendly. There are many musicians that have platinum hits that never see any money from their record label. Almost all platinum level recording artists have income outside of their music. They make business deals, do movies, own real estate and find ways to cash in on their celebrity. This money that is not affiliated with the label will not be touched by the record company. When an artist gets an advance from a record label, it is essentially a loan. Anything the record company pays for will get reimbursed from the artist royalties. Not from the sale of the full album, but from the artists royalties. For artists who get signed, but fail to recoup expenses, they will be \u201cin the red\u201d. They will not have to reach into their pocket to pay back the label, but that debt will transfer to the next album they make. For instance, let\u2019s say you get a record deal. I\u2019m going to go with some general numbers here to make it simple. The label gives you $1,000,000. Your lawyer negotiates you a rate of $1 an album. You sell 1,000,000 records at $10 a pop. Awesome. Your record sold $10,000,000\u2026your royalties are $1,000,000. Whoo hoo! You should see a check soon right? Well, it depends on how your money was spent and managed. Here is what you, the artist, will be paying back out of your royalties. I may be missing a few things. Studio time. This includes not only every minute spent in the studio, but all those times the record label bought you lunch and dinner. Guess who is paying for that? You. Out of your royalties. Even gifts, transportation etc. Record company sent you a limo? Congrats, your paying for that too! Mastering. Producer Fees. If you got the hottest producer of the moment, there is a good chance that the theoretical $1,000,000 you earned has already been eaten up. Music Videos. Hope you had fun filming on that yacht with the underwear models. That is coming out of your royalties. Expenses include catering, makeup artist, stylist, underwear models (they make good money), location, production crew. If you have the \u201cit\u201d director, the fees could be high. Packaging and Distribution. Your CD\u2019s, vinyl, artwork all come out of your $1 royalty. Your digital royalties will most likely be very small, as will your streaming revenue. Promotion. To get your music on TV and radio, an entire team of PR professionals must be hired to put your music into the hands of the decision makers at the various outlets. Wine and Dine business meetings. Meals that are bought by the record company where the goal is to make a business deal on your behalf is expensed to you. This includes when they take you out. There are other expenses, but the above is the bare bones of it. It would not be unusual for the above expenses to outweigh what you, the artist actually made. For the sake of keeping the numbers simple, let\u2019s say the entire project cost $2 million dollars to launch. You, the artist now \u201cowe\u201d the record company $1 million dollars. The record company has $8 million (they of course have plenty of expenses to keep their business running, so it is not all profit for them but they did just fine.) The good news is that no, you will not have to cough up $1,000,000 out of your bank account. The bad news is the record label now must find another way to recoup that money. Depending on what kind of contract you signed, if you signed a 360 deal, the label now has access to your touring, merchandising, possibly your publishing. That one million dollar deficit will be added to the next album if it is not recouped. So how do you make money? Hopefully, you have good business manager who told you before you even went into the studio to diversify. If you\u2019re Justin Beiber, your modeling in your underwear for Guess. If you\u2019re Jennifer Lopez, you are putting out a film every couple of years. If you\u2019re Madonna, you write children\u2019s books (years after your \u201cSex\u201d book). If you\u2019re Sammy Hagar, you have your own tequila to sell. If you\u2019re Snoop Dogg, you\u2019re pimpin\u2019 (allegedly). The record company can not touch the money that is made from these ventures. The brand recognition that the record companies bring to these artists, however, makes it possible for these artists to engage in these opportunities in the first place. So in the end, it kind of works out. If you don\u2019t recoup and you are dropped from the label, you are kind of starting all over again. Several years back, I had a meeting with a business manager who had several platinum artists. The first thing he told me was to start going on plenty of auditions to drum up acting work because artists don\u2019t make money with their record labels. I was on a small label, with major distribution. While I did get some advances for living expenses, I never once saw a dime from the record label as we did not recoup our expenses. My band actually made more money when we were unsigned. What I did get out of it however, was a bit of a \u201cshortcut\u201d to certain gigs. It was easier to get certain industry people to call me back. I was hired to sing on other projects. I did some vocal coaching, had a couple of film/TV placements, and made a couple of cameos in other people\u2019s music videos/indie films. It was all on a much smaller scale, but with the same principles. While I didn\u2019t make any money from my record, I do feel the financial compensation from these other avenues made up for it. It can be a complicated, messy business. It is great for some artists and a total nightmare for others. Some are living the dream, while others will say getting signed was the worst thing that happened to them. It truly runs the gamut. Additionally, remember that the artist has an entire team to pay outside of the record label. They employ managers, business managers, talent agents, lawyers,etc. Everyone is taking a cut. The payroll can be quite enormous. The flip side, is that one hit song can bring in money for decades to come via radio royalties and licensing. So to answer your question, these pop stars are bringing in a vast amount of money for various sources, but there is a constant ebb and flow going in and out. Their living expenses can get quite high, as they now have to hire security as well and live in secluded areas reserved of the rich and famous. If they are not managing their money properly, they can actually get into a lot of debt. A broke pop star can be just as common as a rich one. It is truly a different case scenario for each artist. I hope my breakdown was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Record deals can be incredibly complicated in finance terms. If an artist signs up to a deal with a major label, they will get advances, which have to be recouped from their earnings. Obviously, putting albums together takes time, so the earnings from them will not be seen for some time after that. There are all sorts of sneaky little things that labels put into contracts which are designed to drag out the whole business. An artist can end up still paying off the costs of their first album with their third album. Remember there are more ways for artists to earn than simply from music sales - there are live performance, merchandising and product endorsement (all those hiphop artists with branded headphones, or clothing ranges) I\u2019m not going to try to spell deals out for you, as it\u2019s so complicated. The best source for details on this is Moses Avalon\u2019s book \u2018Confessions of a Record Producer\u2019, which lays out how the business really functions. There is a YouTube interview with him here: Music Industry Consultant Moses Avalon Confessions of a Record Producer Look for his book. It\u2019s very entertaining, as well as grittily factual. As an example of what labels can be like, here is a true story from the UK music business, which happened to a friend of mine a few years ago. He\u2019s a very experienced sessions player who has worked with many world class artists, and had at the time done some national TV work. He and another player of similar stature, both good songwriters too, were invited by a major label to produce a second album for a woman singer/songwriter on their roster. Starting a production partnership seemed very inviting, so they accepted. They were to receive some money upfront, but were relying on the album sales for mechanical and songwriting royalties, as well as the boost it would hopefully provide for their careers. They dropped all other work opportunities for several months and duly produced an excellent quality album. The label said thank you and took the album master. My friend and his production partner waited. And waited. And then realised they had been duped. The artist had been signed by the label with the promise that she could record two albums for them. The contract did not say that the albums would necessarily be RELEASED. By recording the second album, the contract was fulfilled, and she could safely and legally be dumped, with the album master sitting on a shelf in a store room somewhere. Why would she be dumped? Often the case is that someone in the label\u2019s A & R department gets enthusiastic about an artist and signs them to a deal, but in a few months moves on to another label. The artist then has no champion at the label. A new A & R person may see them as a liability, someone they have no interest in spending time on, as they want to find the Next Big Thing themselves and not have some other person\u2019s hand-me-downs. Can you see why Prince was so strong on control of his own music? ",
