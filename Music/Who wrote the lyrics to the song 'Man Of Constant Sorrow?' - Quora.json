            "answer_text": "\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\" On October 13, 2009 on the Diane Rehm Show, Dr. Ralph Stanley of the Stanley Brothers, born in 1927, discussed the song, its origin, and his effort to revive it: \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" is probably two or three hundred years old. But the first time I heard it when I was y'know, like a small boy, my daddy -- my father -- he had some of the words to it, and I heard him sing it, and we -- my brother and me -- we put a few more words to it, and brought it back in existence. I guess if it hadn't been for that it'd have been gone forever. I'm proud to be the one that brought that song back, because I think it's wonderful.\" There is some uncertainty whether Dick Burnett himself wrote the song. One claim is that it was sung by the Mackin clan in 1888 in Ireland and that Cameron O'Mackin emigrated to Tennessee, brought the song with him, and performed it. In an interview he gave toward the end of his life, Burnett himself indicated that he could not remember: Charles Wolfe: \"What about this \"Farewell Song\" -- 'I am a man of constant sorrow' -- did you write it?\"Richard Burnett: \"No, I think I got the ballad from somebody -- I dunno. It may be my song...\" Which means he stole it and wanted credit. If Burnett wrote the song, the date of its composition, or at least of the editing of certain lyrics by Burnett, can be fixed at about 1913. Since it is known that Burnett was born in 1883, married in 1905, and blinded in 1907, the dating of two of these texts can be made on the basis of internal evidence. The second stanza of \"Farewell Song\" mentions that the singer has been blind six years, which put the date at 1913. According to the Country Music Annual, Burnett \"probably tailored a pre-existing song to fit his blindness\" and may have adapted a hymn. Charles Wolfe argues that \"Burnett probably based his melody on an old Baptist hymn called \"Wandering Boy\". So, since this tune appeared in \u201cO, Brother, Where Art Thou\u201d in 2008, I have to go with the most popular version\u2026it\u2019s actually Allison Krauss & Union Station, but I\u2019ll go with The Cohen Brothers every time\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": " It was collected on 17 Aug 1918 by Cecil Sharp from Mrs Frances Richards (pictured above) at St Peter School, Callaway, Franklin Co. Virginia. Sharp\u2019s music book, lyric book and diary don\u2019t say any more about possible origin. However, I suspect Sharp would not have noted it down had it not been the product of oral transmission - the then \u2018definition\u2019 of folk music that Sharp in particular espoused. Franklin Co. was in those days a relatively remote area with good preservation of oral culture - which is why Sharp was there. So I reckon it\u2019s safe to classify it as \u2018trad\u2019, \u2018PD\u2019, and \u2018folk\u2019. The picture is from the EFDSS \u2018Full English\u2019 archive, which I highly recommend. ",
