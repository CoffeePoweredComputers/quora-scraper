            "answer_text": "Obviously, it's Taylor Swift. I'm not joking, sometimes I chose \"celebrities\" as a topic in small talks. I often got this reaction when I mentioned Ariana Grande, \"Is she famous?\". It's not so surprising. There are logical reasons behind this. Note : I'm not going to talk about them in \"real life\", simply because I don't know both of them. I'm just going to talk about something that I can clearly see from the internet. So here's why it's Taylor Swift. The most logical one is that Taylor Swift started her music carreer in 2006 (it's when her first song, \"Tim McGraw\", released) while Ariana Grande started her music carreer in 2011 (it's when her first song, \"Put Your Hearts Up\", released). Taylor had gained popularity and fame (in U.S.) at least 5 years before Ariana Grande even became relevant. You can tell by looking her Billboard Chart History on Hot Country Songs category. \"Tim McGraw\" peaked at #6 and stayed for 32 weeks in the chart. By the time Ariana Grande released her first album, \"Yours Truly\", Taylor Swift had already released her 4th album, \"Red\". One of Taylor Swift's single from that album, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", even peaked at #1 on Billboard 100 category. ",
