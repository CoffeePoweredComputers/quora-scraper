            "answer_text": "This question gives me the opportunity to extol the virtues of largely ignored prog rock band, Flash, again\u2026 Whilst liking the idea of progressive rock musicians having the freedom to do almost anything, I was a big critic of the genre as it progressed through the early 70\u2019s. Bands such as Yes quickly left behind the early promise of tight, well written songs such as Survival from their self titled debut album in favour of vast landscapes of self indulgent nonsense such as Close to the Edge and Tales from Topographic Oceans. In between they came up with stuff like Starship Trooper and Yours is no Disgrace from The Yes Album which are fine tracks and for me, where they peaked, just 3 albums in. The appearance of guitarist Steve Howe on this album meant that Peter Banks had gone and he would go on to form Flash with keyboardist Tony Kaye who was still with Yes when that 3rd album came out in 1971. Flash debuted in \u201972 and with vocalist Colin Carter sounding not unlike Yes frontman Jon Anderson, they were accused of being a poor man's Yes. But if you look deeper, the songs on that album were excellent. Small Beginnings, Children of the Universe and Dreams of Heaven are superb examples of prog at its best. Yes they were complicated with unexpected changes of direction (that's what prog was all about after all\u2026) but they were also accessible with loads of inspired ideas. They don't, however, contain long, improvised solos which should be kept for the gigs if they're played at all. They continued the good work on their 2nd album, In the Can, with Lifetime and There No More, and again with the 3rd, Out of Our Hands, which is consistently good thoughout. None the Wiser, Man of Honour and Psychosync are among my favourite tracks from the band but sadly, there was no more, just the 3 albums. Another band who I felt were more accessible than most but did actually go on to great things was Genesis. Favourite tracks were Stagnation from Trespass, The Musical Box from Nursery Cryme and the epic Supper\u2019s Ready from Foxtrot. They were strong on melody, had some truly bizarre lyrics, and dozens of great musical ideas which provided the platform for a long career even after losing charismatic frontman Peter Gabriel and guitar virtuoso Steve Hackett.
