            "answer_text": "I think Joan Hoffman gives a really good answer, but I disagree that it\u2019s unlikely that the U-2 spy plane program and incident played any part in the inspiration for the name. In fact, I\u2019m going to say the following two somewhat opposing statements: Without the U-2 spy plane, the band would never have been named U2, andThe U-2 program was not the inspiration for the band nameHow can these two diametrically opposed viewpoints both hold true??! Why, let me explain\u2026 Based on the band\u2019s first 2 names \u2014 Hype and Feedback \u2014 it\u2019s obvious they were going for a metaphorical name that would relate to the band in some way (the legend of a band and the alchemy-like, unexpected sounds that come as a result of a band playing together). The thought that a band would change gears so drastically to name themselves after an airplane is a bit wacked, especially considering they never used any kind of plane iconography (until All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind and its accompanying travel themes) which would have been so natural. So as I mention in #2 above, the U-2 program was not the direct inspiration for the name. As per my #1 above, and as Joan points out, Bono\u2019s friend Steve Averill suggested the name U2, and all interviews with the band and Steve seem to support the idea that the name was supposed to be intentionally vague, meaning nonsense (U2), meaning inclusion (you too!), and possible being somewhat combative (hey, you two!). Could even have something to do with a female sheep, but let\u2019s not go there\u2026 The point is, Steve and the boys weren\u2019t interested in the plane at all, but the flexibility and Judo-like qualities of the name. HOWEVER, to bring it around to my #1, I am 93% certain that if there HADN\u2019T been a U-2 program, then the name would never have been dreamt up and suggested by Steve, nor adopted by the band. It\u2019s not like they chose NE1 or something. Not something completely nonsensical and made up. They chose U2, a somewhat widely known military spy plane that played a dramatic and important part in a global chess match between the world powers of the West/US and Russia. So the term came to Steve\u2019s mind because it was a known quantity, but yet not so remarkably famous that it\u2019s the only thing people would ever associate with the word. Making it both familiar and ambiguous. Remarkable! My best proof for this assertion is that early on in the band\u2019s career, show promoters would often incorrectly spell the band\u2019s name as \u201cU-2\u201d on posters \u2014 which means even the promoters were thinking they were named for the plane! (I tried to find an image quickly but couldn\u2019t with limited time\u2026) So in summary\u2026 I assert that the notion of the name U2 came to Steve only because of the spy plane, but the inspiration behind choosing the name was its flexible and ambiguous meaning.

            "answer_text": "YES I KNOW IT WAS. This band was under a new theme and sub genre known as CONSCIENSCIOUS and was as much of a MOVEMENT as it was an actual sub genre. Only a few bands delved into that and even fewer really made there but for those they made it really big. REM from rem sleep mode was so big at a certain point they they managed to dwarf Micheal Jackson and that was no small deal.\u2019 Even today U2 is on a level so far above most bands that the scale simply no longer applies. On a lessor note, MIDNIGHT OIL from Australia and MISSING PERSONS also tried this theme and they did well with it and Missing Persons is classic but those just never quite hit that mach zone of U2 and REM. SO why name a band after the U2 program? THE U2 PROGRAM WAS ALL ABOUT AN AGE, A TECHNICAL ERA, AND A GLOBAL MINDSET ALL TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME TO CREATE A TIME CAPSULE. The band wanted to capture that in theme and feel. Many more intellectual based bands opt for that type of feel and purpose from their name and is why the guys from Canada during the DRUG INDUCED 1970\u2019s CHOSE TO CALL THEIR BAND = RUSH. ",
