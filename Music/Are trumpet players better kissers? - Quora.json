            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a flute and whistle player and have tried sax, trumpet and clarinet. Flute players: excellent kissers in general, but some jazz flute players may have short attention spans. Irish whistle players: excellent kissers, with a strong tendency to go for very long kisses Reed instrument players: it depends. Their lips may be OK, they may be very assertive in expressing sensual experience, but some may be highly aggressive and they may expect a kiss to turn into a bite and a meal. Some are known to high egocentric obsessions around date time. Generally good kissers, some being comedians, and some being cannibals. Trumpet players: they\u2019re used to a lot of obstruction around the lips, and while they put up with resistance well, they are not used to the texture changing or the notes coming back to them from another player. You may entirely freak them out if you give them the sensation that what\u2019s on their lips is alive and moving, or different than the two custom mouthpieces they ordered from England a couple years ago. Yamaha and Bach do not make a \u201cKissing Trumpet\u201d mouthpiece. They may start crying if they realize they can\u2019t control the instrument any more. They may feel lost and need guidance and reassurance that the world isn\u2019t ending, or that they will need to stop trumpet and take up drums. It all depends. I\u2019d say that kissing, for a trumpet player, is a good character test. Test out a few hundred. Look for the ones who play happy music with a lot of range of expression. Beware the ones who play only very serious music and have extra-expensive trumpets. Note: while testing out kissers, beware of transmittable diseases, so keep it dry. That may be tough with flute, whistle, sax, clarinet and even trombone players, who are definitely drawn to sharing full uninhibited wet kisses. Then of course, we have the double reed players, and almost all of them are cannibals and highly aggressive once you break through their calm outer surface. Worst kissers in the orchestra, but they can get the cap off a bottle of beer with their lips quite effortlessly. Good company when camping, as long as you have police with you! ",

            "answer_text": "You must have heard that old joke? Three university freshman girls had heard that brass players are better kissers because of their lip control, so each one arranged a date with a different brass player to test their theory. They gathered in their dorm afterward and compared notes. The first one dated a trumpet player. \u201cSo, how did he kiss?\u201d her friends asked. \u201cNot so great. His lips were like wood and he held the back of my head and pressed in way too hard.\u201d The second one dated a tuba player. \u201cIt was gross. All that saliva, and so blubbery and loose! Also, his cheeks bulged.\u201d The third one was asked how her date who played the french horn kissed. \u201cHis kissing was fine, but what I really liked was how he held me!\u201d (Of course, absent from this joke are the trombone players, because everyone knows that trombonists are the sexiest brass players of all! I have to keep telling myself that, over and over again\u2026) ",
