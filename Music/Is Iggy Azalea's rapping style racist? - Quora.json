            "answer_text": "Yes. Iggy Azalea--which isn't even remotely close to her real name\u2014has been criticized by a number of black artists, who accuse her of cultural appropriation and of performing in blaccent. Rapper Jean Grae went as far as to call Azalea's performance \u201cverbal blackface.\u201d It is highly offensive that a non-black person is adopting a distinctive black accent and manner of speech in order to perform. This suggests that black identity is inauthentic, just an act that white people can put on for the entertainment of (largely) other white people. That's the very definition of a blackface minstrel act. Azalea's voice while performing is completely different from the one she uses offstage, which offends a lot of authentic black artists. Her performance suggests that a white person can adopt and slough off black identity and authenticity at will. This is racist. Azalea's music is no less offensive than Hank Azaria, a white man, voicing an \u201cIndian\u201d character for years on The Simpsons. Hank Azaria's performance consisted of adopting an exaggerated Indian accent and playing it for cheap laughs. Thankfully, the character was eventually written off the show and Azaria took some level of responsibility. So why is Iggy Azalea not being held equally accountable? ",

            "answer_text": "No, In our culture, we like the tough, stereotypical rap style that most artists into rap do. Do you want to hear some wack Australian rappin. Well, it would be interesting, but rap, admittingly, is j thought of as tough or emotional. Which is where the voice comes from. ",
