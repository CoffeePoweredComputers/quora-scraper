            "answer_text": "One way to go about is to separate what you are currently doing into two parts: Recognising notes on a stave, andRecognising notes on the keyboard via their note namesTrying to match the note as its represented on the stave to a key on the piano may not be something that you or your daughter finds intuitive at first - I know I didn't! Reading Written Music A super simple and easy way of remembering notes on a stave with a treble clef is by using word cues:  For the notes in the spaces: F A C EFor the notes on the lines: Every Good Boy Deserves FruitVisually:   Source: Can I Read Music? Everyone uses a slightly different phrase for the notes on the lines. The one above is the one that I learnt; you can use a different phrase if that one doesn't really stick for you. At the start, you can stick with just reading notes within the stave. Don't worry about anything that happens above or below it - the scale repeats up and down the piano, so once you can comfortably read what's going on within the stave, reading the rest of it will be easy-peasy! Note: As far as I know, this method won't work as well if you're using the solf\u00e8ge method to read pitch. I learnt to read music using letters, so I'm not too knowledgeable about how people go about learning to read music in solf\u00e8ge, but I assume that rather than splitting the notes up into lines and spaces, you would just learn the whole 8 note scale in one go. That's my guess! Identifying Notes on the Keyboard I have a very vague memory from when I first started out piano. My sister and I started learning at about the same time and our lessons were back to back so our teacher would give each of us a laminated print out of one octave of the piano (similar to the one below) to occupy us while the other was having their lesson. The idea was to drill into our minds the 'names' for each key on the piano. This could work for you! Another way is to put temporary stickers on each key on the piano with their note names written on them. This will work with both letters and solf\u00e8ge. Use different colours for easier differentiation and extra fun!   Source: Printable Piano Keys with Notes I suggest just focusing on the white keys first. The black keys (sharps and flats) can wait until you after you know the white keys like the back of your hand. Practise, practise, practise! Unfortunately, the only way of putting these two parts together is through practise. You might find that you are picking one up a lot faster than the other: You know exactly which key on the keyboard is which but the stave still looks like a bunch of dots and lines; orYou can read the notes on the stave with the same ease as a sentence in your favourite book, but you just can't seem to remember what key that corresponds to on the keyboard.If the former is happening, then write the letter names above the notes on the stave for the ones that you have the most trouble with. The contour of the melody should provide a good enough visual indication of what note comes next. Overtime, you should find that you do not need these cues. Also, a great online resource that you can use to check your speed of note identification is this exercise on musictheory.net: http://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note If the latter is the case, then put temporary stickers on your piano keys with the note names written on them (like I mentioned before). With more and more practise, muscle memory should kick in and the stickers won't be needed. This concept is similar to touch-typing I suppose! If, like me, you have little patience for constantly bobbing your head up and down to look up at the sheet music and back down at your fingers on the keys, it helps to be familiar with the melody you are playing first so that you can at least use some of your own intuition to figure out what comes next rather than solely relying on the sheet music. If you can, try and find a recording of the piece you are playing to familiarise yourself with what it should sound like before you start learning it. I hope my suggestions help and all the best with your future piano endeavours! ",

            "answer_text": "Start by memorizing where middle C is.  Why middle C (as apposed to learning where the 'A' note is) you might ask? Middle C is usually directly below the first letter of the brand name printed on the piano.  For example, on a Yamaha piano, look at where the \"Y\" is, middle C will be right below the Y.  This is true for most pianos.  From that reference point, you can then continue on with D, E, F, G, and then A and B, back to the next C. Also, C is always the white note just to the left of the group of two black notes.  The pattern repeats all throughout the keyboard. The piano is basically a \"C\" instrument (all the white notes in in the key of C major).  Middle C on the written music staff is usually the first note a new student learns. Once the student learns one octave (from C to C), the pattern keeps repeating.   Also, please note that the student should really only worry about learning one or two \"new notes\" per week before going on to learn all the notes.  One doesn't graduate high school by skipping from First Grade right up to 12th Grade.  You get there one grade, one year, at a time.  Learn about one or two notes a week.  When that note is learned and memorized on the piano AND on the written music staff, THEN learn another note and master that one before continuing on to more notes.  There is so much to learning piano, and it all takes time and practice.  No need to jump right in and have to know all the notes at once.  Because after then notes are learned, there's still a LOT more to learn.  So take it one step at a time. ",
