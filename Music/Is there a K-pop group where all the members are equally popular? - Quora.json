            "answer_text": "Simple answer, no. Good question though, nice intention I see there. Popularity is subjectively measured, meaning there's no unit (like km for distance and kg for mass) to measure someone's popularity, we just assume it whether it is domestic (Korea) or international, subconsciously concluding on the group's chart performance, MV numbers and social interactions with fans. Many K-pop groups are huge, like plentiful of them have more than 7 members. It is kinda sad but in no version of universe ever all the members of such big groups will be equally popular. It is literally impossible. Take BTS for example, 7 members, no doubt at all that Taehyung is more popular than Jin. Consider IZONE now, Sakura is more popular than Yena in the 12 member group. The bigger the group, the lesser the chance of it being your question's answer. Ok now consider small groups. Like 4 members? BLACKPINK. Here, Jennie excels Rose, again not all equally popular. MAMAMOO? Hwasa is undoubtedly more famous than Wheein, again not equal. 3 member groups? Sub-unit doesn't count as a K-pop group as they really are just an incomplete version, mostly consisting of the group's most popular members. But still, let's for the sake of answering consider Orange Caramel, which to be honest is also a subgroup. Here, Nana again triumphs the other 2. There are many more original trios but unfortunately they're not widely known, no offense directed to anyone. Hence I won't name further. However if you relax your 'equality' to a certain extent then I think we might be able to compromise somewhere. This is something we notice in small groups when compared to big groups, small and big as in member count. There still is gonna be some error but not as much. For e.g. this is IZONE. Observe the variations  This is BLACKPINK, again observe the variations and compare with IZONE  Another example being MAMAMOO.  The popularity doesn't become equal but more 'uniform' if you come from a large member count group to a small member count group. Which is understandable. Another thing to note is that this definitely doesn't consist of all the fan votes, these are by fans who cared to do so. And I'm mentioning this here to give an example of \u2018uniformity\u2019 against 'equality' in K-pop group member \u2018popularity\u2019. The authenticity of this may or may not credible, nor it is to be believed as a rockstrong. There's a reason why K-pop groups have so many members, they want to attract as many audience as possible. More diverse fans, bigger audience, bigger comebacks, more money for the company label. Hence there always will be someone who's more adored or popular than the other in the group. It is almost impossible to have an absolutely correct answer to your question. ",

            "answer_text": "There are always going to be more popular and underrated members but a group where a good proportion of fandom is considered OT would probably be Mamamoo- In general people may think that Hwasa overshadows the group but you\u2019ll realize that fans love everyone equally and all members shine equally. Wheein may be considered a little underrated as she is a very chill person whereas Hwasa has now become sort of an icon,Moonbyul stands out because of her rap,being Colleague 1 on Solar\u2019s YT channel, Solar has been known to be genuinely dedicated towards the fans and wholeheartedly tries to reach out to moomoos and make them feel close. Despite the fact that Wheein promotes considerably less she does not get completely overshadowed by the other three. Each member is a Billboard charting soloist-their solos sell well and chart well. Other groups would be Monsta X , BTOB , Got7 simply because you can\u2019t imagine how the group dynamic will change if one member leaves even though we have all seen them without some members. We saw Got7 without Jackson,JB,Bambam, BTOB with their military services and Monsta X without Wonho, I think monbebes,melodies and ahgases will understand this. Theirs fans are dedicated towards the group rather than a member. Solo stans are respectful and never drag down the group. In terms of solo projects all Exo members do very well, Chen who is underrated in the fandom is known by Korea because of his OSTs. His solo album swept the charts not because of fans but because of Koreans. Every member has a handful of solos,dramas and collaborations. Exo members do have longevity in the industry despite Sehun,Kai, Chanyeol and Baekhyun being the seemingly most popular or rather their stans are more active all members have a considerable following. Even the ex-members are enjoying a stable and successful solo career. l feel the perfect answer to this question would be Mamamoo. ",
