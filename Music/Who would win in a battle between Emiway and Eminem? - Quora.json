            "answer_text": "Now what I think is emiway is a pretty good rapper with catchy lines and sick flow but you really must be kidding to ask such a question. It\u2019s like comparing Albert Einstein with his own pupil. I\u2019ll show you why I think so: Eminem has deepest lyrics in the rap game and widest range of vocabulary(reads dictionary like a novel). The diverse words themselves would kill Emiway lyrically as I personally think Emiway is lyrically not so deep.Check out some of Eminem\u2019s freestyle raps on youtube and you\u2019ll yourself recognize that he is pretty quick in spitting dope lyrics.Also both these rappers rap in different languages. Emiway also raps in English but still this would again be an advantage for Eminem.Eminem is known for destroying many careers through his words, so I don\u2019t think Emiway would like to be one of them by pulling off a beef.Many consider Eminem as the greatest rapper alive and Emiway has still much more things to learn and hope so we will see him among the tops.Also Eminem\u2019s fanbase is pretty vast and deeply rooted, say some words against him and they are onto you. So you would have to face the fans first and then him, the best example of it is MGK.So there you have it, the rule to rap battle Eminem: \u2018Don\u2019t let him go first, don\u2019t let him go second, don\u2019t battle with the rap god.\u2019",

            "answer_text": "I guess It is very difficult to say who will win in a rap battle as we know they both rap in different languages. Both are genius in their own game. If we talk about Emiway he has lots to acheive yet. He has good rhyming skill. He can rap faster.He delivers what people want to listen plus he has very wide subjects or topics to rap about. He is not limited to one subject. And If we talk about Eminem he is in the rap game since 2000s. He has made songs about everthing from making fun of celebrities to inspirational songs. As he is getting older his music is gettting better with time. So, I think It would be difficult to say who will win in a rap battle. But If they both are gonna battle in English rap undoubtfully Eminem will win. ",
