            "answer_text": "Kirk met Antonia while horseriding on a Spring day near his uncle\u2019s barn in Idaho, eleven years before being swept into the Nexus in 2293 (78 years before 2371, the year in which the main bulk of the film, as well as DS9 Season 3 and VOY Season 1, takes place). This puts his meeting with Antonia in 2282; between The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan. Star Trek: The Motion Picture picks up only a few short years after the original TV series, at least two-and-a-half years after the end of the five-year mission, despite a whole decade having elapsed off-screen. The Wrath of Khan took a different tack, acknowledging the passage of time and dealing with Kirk\u2019s mid-life crisis as he reaches middle age. Generations establishes that between the two films, Kirk temporarily retired from Starfleet and had a relationship with Antonia, but chose to leave her and return to duty, preparing her favourite meal to \u201csoften the blow.\u201d Non-canonical tie-in novels have named the character Antonia Salvatori after the stunt actress Lynn Salvatori, who played her, and have offered differing accounts of the relationship (David R George\u2019s novel The Star to Every Wandering is inconsistent with David A Goodman\u2019s The Autobiography of James T. Kirk, for example). ",
