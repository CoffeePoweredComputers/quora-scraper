            "answer_text": "A2A. There are several dishes that come to mind. Since they are very different it is hard to pick one over the others. Let\u2019s see what pops up from the depths of my memories. The corned tongue I got in Montreal was amazing. In Taiwan I was served some fried pigeon wrapped in lettuce leaves that was wonderful. In Stockholm I had a reindeer steak smothered in a dark sauce with mushrooms at some place in the Gamla Stan which was so shockingly good that it ruined my taste for the wild venison that came off the farm for a couple of years. I thought of joking and saying just about anything from France because they are so darn good with almost anything but they way they do duck, frog legs, and sweet breads really stands out for me. There\u2019s a Mexican whole fish called Mojarra that I really like even though it is just a common lunch item for them. In Japan there is a ubiquitous lunch dish call Tonkatsu which is just simple, thinly cut and pounded pork deep fried. Nice crunchy coating with an intensely flavorful sauce for dipping. I can get it here now but it\u2019s a long drive. The chicken version is available locally and while I like it the pork speaks to my palate more fluently. I haven\u2019t looked up what the base of the sauce is, my mind just calls it \u201cJapanese Sweet Baby Ray\u2019s\u201d. I regret that I have yet to visit Portugal, Spain, the other Mediterranean states, the Middle East, Africa or South America so I don\u2019t want to include them only based on what our local restaurants offer. I am a huge fan of lamb souvlaki on pita freshly made on a clay heater, though. Sounds like a couple of bucket list trips to me. I\u2019ve stared at this list for way too long now and I really can\u2019t pick a favorite. Heck, with luck I will run across something new I haven\u2019t tried yet and hopefully be able to add another memory. Thanks for a question that made me salivate! ",

            "answer_text": "Fleischsalat. It is a German breakfast spread made of ham and pickles, and a quark sauce. (Sorry I still don\u2019t know exactly what quark is to be able to explain it). You put it on bread and it is a savory, salty taste that I can not find here in the USA. If anyone knows how to find it in New England, please let me know. I miss is so much since ending my exchange to Germany.  Also I love currywurst. It is the most amazing combination of wurst sausage and ketchup with curry powder. It\u2019s tangy, delicious and really easy to make! Make sure to get good sausage though. I recommend eating it with pommes/fries.  As you can tell I love German food. The next food is also a breakfast food. Every breakfast on the weekend, most Germans eat freshly baked bread. This breadroll / brotchen is baked in the way a croissant is, so the bread is layered and soft. The outsided is crispy and hard. It is so good. Sorry I couldn\u2019t find a picture of it. ",
