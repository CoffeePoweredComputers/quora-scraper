            "answer_text": "The movies gross only includes the theatrical gross. It is the most important criteria psychologically and PR wise but ultimately it doesn't mean anything other than a non huge budget film. For a movie older than 8 years ago, you can generally divide the gross by half to show how much the studio-distributor takes home. Back then, there are other huge revenue streams such as DVD sales, premium cable, other tv and intl sales to contribute another hundred of millions for a mobster hit. The importance of the movie gross is generally tied to what gets backend deals - the studio doesn't share the other revenue. The movie budget is essentially meaningless as the studio starts a running total on the muffin the producer ate 11 years ago when he said, we should go a movie about _________. Same with ad dollars which includes free ads from partners which they count against the film but ultimately costs the studio nothing. By studio accounting, the Harry Potter movies are like $500 mm underwater \u2026 The numbers are diff now. ",

            "answer_text": "It shows how much money has been made at the box office in general. The budget is listed elsewhere or as an extra. In case of The Dark Knight, you have to subtract the budget from the gross. . . . Aaaaaand then you also have to subtract the costs for advertisment and such stuff. And in terms of these costs, the studios often don`t tell us what they have to pay for trailers or TV Spots. For blockbusters they are often estimated about extra 50 million dollars and sometimes even more. All in all you can say, The Dark Knight made at least 700 Million dollars just on the box office alone and that is a hell of a money. ",
