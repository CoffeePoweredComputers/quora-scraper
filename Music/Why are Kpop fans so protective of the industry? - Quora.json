            "answer_text": "Why wouldn't we be? As fans, we should respect and support our idols. And love them as they are. The companies they work with try their best and the idols try their best too but as they say, you can't please everyone. Take BTS for example. They literally starved themselves because some so called \u201cfans\u201d were saying they were fat and ugly. I love them all to death. I will do almost anything for them. It makes no sense to me to criticize them when they try so hard to make us happy. I want to get into the music industry when I get older. When I do, I will take the time to show the people who criticize what that does to you. It's WRONG! It shouldn't be done by ANYONE for anything!!!! It literally makes me sick! So if you don't understand why we are so protective, I hope this helps you out. ",
