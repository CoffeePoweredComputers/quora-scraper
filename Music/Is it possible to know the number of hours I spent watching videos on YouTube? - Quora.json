            "answer_text": "Before you proceed, please make sure you have the latest update of the YouTube app on your smartphone, whether you\u2019re using an iOS or Android app. Check the Time To see how much time you\u2019ve spent on YouTube videos, follow these three steps: Open the YouTube app on your smartphone.Tap the \u201cAccount\u201d icon with your profile image in the upper right corner.Tap \u201cTime watched\u201d.Here you can see your watch time for today, yesterday, and the past seven days. Another pretty useful statistic is your daily average, which can be an indicator of whether you\u2019ve been spending too much time watching YouTube on a daily basis Please keep in mind, that if you\u2019re using YouTube Music or YouTube TV, these times won\u2019t be factored in the \u201cTime Watched\u201d feature. Besides this limitation, the watch times are calculated from all other YouTube products you\u2019ve used to access the video content. Things to Note In order to allow YouTube to calculate your watch time, you have to be signed in to your account. That way, everything you watch is kept in your Watch History, which is the main database for the Time Watched feature. If you delete a video from your watch history, it won\u2019t count in your watch time. Also, any views recorded in Chrome\u2019s Incognito mode, or any similar feature in other browsers, won\u2019t count either. That traffic doesn\u2019t get registered to your watch history because of the privacy security such modes provide. One thing to consider when using this feature, is YouTube\u2019s Autoplay option that automatically plays video after video. If you have it turned on and leave YouTube playing while you\u2019re not watching the videos, all that will be included in your total watch time as well. Also, Google points out that there\u2019s a known issue existing in this feature. It affects the time watched on your computer, which isn\u2019t reported correctly in Time Watched. More Options Besides the statistics mentioned above, this feature also gets a couple of other tools that can help you optimize your watch time. Remind Me to Take a Break This option allows you to set a reminder that will appear while watching videos. In order to effectively remind you to take a break. When the time comes, it will automatically pause the video for you. Of course, it won\u2019t force you to stop watching YouTube, since that wouldn\u2019t be in the platform\u2019s best interest. Because the reminder appears in the form of a notification, it goes away when you dismiss it or simply resume playing the video. This feature uses a timer that counts the time only when watching YouTube on your smartphone. If you pause or close a video, it pauses the timer as well. In turn, the timer resets each time you close the YouTube app, sign out, switch devices, or pause the video for more than 30 minutes. The timer doesn\u2019t work for offline videos, as well as when you\u2019re casting from your smartphone to another device. Autoplay Next Video On/Off When you finish a video, another plays automatically. When choosing which video to play next, YouTube bases these recommendations on your watch history. If connected to a mobile network, after 30 minutes of inactivity, Autoplay will stop. For Wi-Fi connections, the limit is four hours. Both of these limitations prevent you from either spending too much of your mobile internet or having your computer work for hours on end. Scheduled Digest This feature takes all your daily push notifications that you would normally receive to your mobile device, and delivers them to you once a day. The default setting is at 7 PM, but you can change it to whichever time suits you the best. Please note that while this feature works on both Android smartphones and tablets, it\u2019s currently available only for iPhone, and not for iPad. Disable Sounds & Vibrations You can also set all your YouTube notifications to be silent, without distracting you with sounds and vibrations. You\u2019re also able to choose the time when these will be silent, with the default setting having them turned off in the period between 10 PM and 8 AM. Just so you\u2019re aware, this feature won\u2019t prevent notifications from getting to your device. Also, it doesn\u2019t affect the upload notifications, which are delivered silently by default. And as with the Scheduled Digest, this won\u2019t work on your iPad as well. Keep Your Watch Time in Check Having so much content to view on YouTube, the Time Watched feature is a pretty good addition. It helps you track how much time you actually spend on videos each day. And if you accidentally get carried away with cooking tips or watching how the internal combustion engine works on the inside, you can have the app remind you it\u2019s maybe time to hit that stop button. Do you find this feature useful? Were you aware of how much time you spend on YouTube each day? Care to share your daily average? If so, please leave a comment in the section below. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201cTime watched\u201d section in the native iOS application (it\u2019s probably available in other places too) will let you see how long you\u2019ve spent watching YouTube videos in the last seven days. It will also let you know how much more/less this is than the previous seven days. I assume you\u2019re looking for something that covers a longer time period. I made a free iOS application called Sownata that is designed to help people visualise the usage data that platforms like YouTube allow users to download. If you use Google Takeout to download your YouTube data it *will* give you your viewing history but it doesn\u2019t tell you i. how much of the video you actually watched (you might only have watched 10 seconds of a 10 minute video) or ii. how long the video is. Now you *could* lookup each video and see how long it is but this would be a pretty arduous process. It would be nice if Google gave you this data via Takeout; I would expect that it\u2019s something they know. The best I could do was to just count each \u201cwatch\u201d event. That is still pretty powerful when trying to understand your viewing habits. The chart below shows (a slightly anonymised version of) how many YouTube videos I have ever watched (broken down by channel)\u2026  ",
