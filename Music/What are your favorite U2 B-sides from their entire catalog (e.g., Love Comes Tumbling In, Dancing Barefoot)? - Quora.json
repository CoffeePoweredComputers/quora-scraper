            "answer_text": "\u201cDancing Barefoot\u201d, by far!!! I mean\u2026by very far!  The story goes way back in 1989, when the song was issued as one of the \u201cB-side\u201d tracks of the \u201cWhen Love Comes To Town\u201d maxi-single. The frenzy about U2, after their landmark \u201cJoshua Tree\u201d album was at its height globally. Following the \u201cRattle & Hum\u201d double LP, the madness continued; thus, this maxi-single was issued also in Greece:  \u201cWhen Love Comes To Town\u201d - U2 (maxi single, Island 4903, 1989, GR) (source: Discogs: U2 - When Love Comes To Town). Things went like that: a little older she-cousin, very influential on me about rock music in my teenagerhood, came home holding this one on her arms, excited about their hit self-titled tune. She was (and still is) a strong Beatles fan (that reminds me of someone else, hmmm\u2026) but, during that period, she was under the spell of Bono and his mates. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to listen to this, young man!\u201d she shouted fully thrilled almost the moment she entered into our home, coming directly from a local record shop. As far as I can recall, it was a hot summer day in Athens, we were on summer vacations, old enough to enjoy the company without parents around (which were on work that morning, anyway). Before I realized it, the brand new record was on the turntable, iced-coffees were made, some cigarettes were lit (parents were not home, mind you) and the party had begun. \u201cWhen Love\u2026\u201d started blasting out (loud!) from the speakers- and it was a total killer! I already knew it from the radio, but it was a real pleasure enjoying it home, coming directly from my humble \u201chi-fi\u201d system! It must have been also my early introduction to the \u201cB.B. King\u201d sound and name, as well. OK, it was fantastic, but no surprise here. Nevertheless, I was ready to repeat the track, when my cousin asked to \u201clisten to the whole thing, I\u2019ll leave it here for a few days, you can play it as many times as you want later\u201d. OK, I succumbed, a bit reluctantly - these B-sides most of the time doesn\u2019t mean that much (except when coming from a Beatles\u2019 single, I guess). \u201cIt\u2019s your record\u201d, I thought, \u201cand it\u2019s brand new, let\u2019s give it a spin\u201d. And there it came! I was instantly enchanted from the very first chords of Edge\u2019s guitar. Bono added more magic when came singing \u201cShe-is benediction, she-is addicted to he\u2026\u201d, the rhythm section entered, the song immediately developed fully and I was blown! What, for God\u2019s sake, is happening here?! Is this a B-side?! No, this is a masterpiece, it felt almost otherworldly. I was left ecstatic and also wondering: \u201cWhy did they leave this one out of the album? Do they have better tracks than that?\u201d To cut a long story short, I played this gem to death that day. And the next one. And the next-to-next one. Then, I taped it - and almost destroyed the tape form the repeated playing. I had two pals called home to have it a listen - and they were blown away, too. One of them left my home directly for the record shop to buy the single! It was the \u201ctalk of the day\u201d in our (small) rocking guys company for days. And we all agreed that these days, U2 were \u201cthe biggest band on the planet\u201d! It took us a while to discover that it was a cover - we were that thrilled. Indeed, the song is written by Patti Smith and Ivan Kr\u00e1l. Originally, it came as a second single from the Patti Smith Group from her fourth album \u201cWave\u201d (1979). I discovered the original cover years later and I was also blown away. The song is a musical, melodic masterpiece, enhanced furthermore by the almost whispering, hoarse voice of Patti - while the rest of the band is on top form! To be fair, I also post the original cover here:  \u201cDancing Barefoot\u201d, Patti Smith Group, 1979 Funny thing: coincidentally, I\u2019m very into Patti Smith Group\u2019s records these days, being constantly amazed by the artistry and personality of Mrs. Smith! What a performer! But, for all the memories I wrote above, between the two, I am still in favor of the U2 cover. The original is brilliant, as well - but the cover was like \u201cfirst time, first love\u201d; you can\u2019t beat that. That\u2019s all! Now, I\u2019m gonna spin that U2 maxi on the turntable once again! PS: Source for the songs: YouTube. I own no rights for the songs, images and artwork, whatsoever. ",

Here\u2019s what Mr. The Edge had to say about it - \u201cThere was a song called \u2018Lady With the Spinning Head\u2019 which we were really struggling with. It eventually ended up as a B-Side. But we tried and failed to develop it so many times. It actually spawned three different songs, \u201cThe Fly,\u201d \u201cUltraviolet (Light My Way)\u201d and \u201cZoo Station\u201d. If you ever listen to \u201cLady With the Spinning Head\u201d you will hear elements of all of those songs. \u201cZoo Station\u201d was a version that we took in a more industrial direction. Danny provided an incredibly mad intro which sounds like a keyboard but is in fact guitar on which I\u2019m creating strange textures.\u201d ",
