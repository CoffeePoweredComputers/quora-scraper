            "answer_text": "Because he had just bought his family home, and only a half bottle of wine was found, and the death occurred on the exact date of his close friend Chris Cornell's birthday, about whom he may well have known why he might have been murdered, if he was, and wouldn't likely kill himself on Cornell's birthday, if he was merely hit hard by his friend's death \u2026 and Cornell had spoken in an interview about how much he realized his son needs him and was very natural emotionally, but also Chester had Clinton Foundation / Haiti connection, because there is a possible Podesta sex crime knowledge, while Chester's official dad was in a police sex crimes unit: there is a good, even handed YouTube video discussion about how Podesta knew his mother and seems to have abused him; Chris even looks uncannily like Podesta, so maybe he was his son. The YouTube video is called, \u201cChris Cornell and Chester Bennington: What did they know?\u201d, and the thinker's channel is, \u201cHigher Truth\u201d. (Moreover, Chris had mentioned Paul McCartney's death and replacement in 1966 as a fact, in passing, and probably would have gotten some fans contacting him about what they'd assume was a joke, and he might well have begun afterwards to say no, it's relatively widely known and/or discussed in the music industry, or even begun, behind the scenes, to make ripples about telling). \u2026 At the very least, we must say the deaths seem to be linked, and what the likely causes are. But we will likely not get confirmation. RIP both, no matter what. ",
