            "answer_text": "Before I answer this, I\u2019ll begin with a disclaimer that I like trap music overall, and some of the criticisms I\u2019m going to mention are not necessarily my own, but rather just things that I\u2019ve heard around the way. Also, much of the criticism directed at trap music is a result of it being immensely popular, which is consistent with all forms of newly popular music. Be it crunk, bro country, dubstep, emo, or even teen pop, whenever a subgenre of music breaks into the mainstream, it will face heat and hate from all sides. Trap is just the latest music form to crash the pop party. And on that note, let\u2019s look at a few common criticisms from hip hop fans. Generational gap Trap music has been around for a long time, but the modern version of it is different than what was around in its origins in the mid-2000s (and arguably earlier). The original form of trap music was a subgenre of Southern rap notable for songs about the life of crime, particularly in the drug trade. The new generation of trap music is more pop-oriented party music. This change underscores the issue that longtime fans of trap music have: there is a generational divide in which the new version of the music is different from the original music in terms of lyrical content and productions. Nonsensical lyrics The most common criticism of the new generation of trap music is that it is lyrically lacking. Rap music allows for eloquence, mind-bending lyricism, and vivid storytelling among the best artists. But many trap songs feel like brand idolatry, hedonistic non-sequiturs, and random, excessive cursing. While many of the songs are by skillful rappers, the songs lack content. They aren\u2019t really about anything. Where first-generation trap music offered great depth even when talking about the world of crime, the new stuff just glorifies drugs and partying without any examination. It\u2019s fantastic party music, but it\u2019s not good listening music. Rapper-Singers I often hear complaints about the singing. There are many guys like Lil Yachty, Young Thug and Fetty Wap (example below: \u201cTrap Queen\u201d) who sing almost as much as they rap, or rap in a way that blurs the line with singing. This is nothing new in hip hop music: from Bone Thugs N Harmony and Andre 3000 to Pharrell and T-Pain, there are plenty of rappers who have done this. But trap musicians often sound a bit too untrained and unpolished. The singing is melodic and catchy to some, but amateurish and grating to others.  Mmmummmmble Then there is the mumble rap. Mumble rappers are the guys whose drawls, lack of enunciation, new-school slang and overall flow render their lyrics nearly incomprehensible. These guys are some of the most polarizing figures in hip hop. For people who like to understand what their rappers are saying, mumble rappers REALLY make you work for it. Some people just don\u2019t have the patience. Trapsaturation I mentioned above that trap is popular, but that may be an understatement. The signature sounds of trap - the hi-hats, synths and 808 bass pumps - have made their way into R&B, pop and EDM. It has also made it\u2019s way into rock. One of the big hits of 2016 was Panic at the Disco\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Bachelor.\u201d The song is deliberately eclectic, mixing Sinatra-style crooning with a trap beat. It\u2019s an awesome song, but it also is a sign that trap beats are so ubiquitous that the genre is now unavoidable. Pop music is saturated with trap, and only half of it is from rappers. It\u2019s on the verge of getting played out.  SKRRRT!!! Onomatopoeia is largely associated with trap music, and it drives some music fans nuts. Onomatopoeia is the use of sounds to phonetically imitate something else. Trap rappers do this a lot, especially guys like The Migos. Listen to a song like \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d their hit single that reached No. 1 on the pop charts at the start of the year. Try to count how many times they do a dog bark, pigeon coo, or screeching tires (otherwise known as SKRT SKRT) in the background. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s often. The \u201cSKRT SKRT\u201d sound has taken on a life of it\u2019s own because so many rappers do it so frequently. We\u2019ve arrived at a point where it\u2019s featured on t-shirts and other swag because it has become so popular. You could blame trap for that. This also falls under the category of nonsensical lyrics, but it\u2019s so unique it deserves its own mention.  To Summarize Most criticism of trap music is about the fact that it just isn\u2019t listening music. It\u2019s mostly party music with fantastic beats, so when it plays in the club or while driving in your car with the (rain drop) drop top down, it sounds fine. And because it\u2019s so popular those trap beats are everywhere, so the party will follow you wherever you go. Just don\u2019t expect much outside of the party jams. Lyrically speaking, trap - as a whole - falls short. ",

            "answer_text": "Current popular music has no soul. We have technology to thank. This is the tragedy when Silicon Valley boys create cold technology which is utilized by profit driven interests who then capitalize and create an inferior product. Both groups have zero comprehension of what it is to be hip, emotional, soulful or perform artistically. Their approach is destructive and void of musical creativity. My childhood is etched in musical richness. I was raised to enjoy and appreciate all genres of music. From classical, jazz, Rock, Global, Euro, Techno, House, R&B, Pop, British New wave, Disco, grunge, HipHop and 3 plus decades of Rap. Every decade would usher in a new sound. Every new sound would produce anticipation, excitement, cultural and societal shift and dramatically alter fashion and dance trends. Emerging music trends rattled the establishment, the result of which produced great music. Music that unites, protests, experiments and inspires. Older music had richness, diversity and a variety of genres.There were so many different artists each with their own unique sound. Some of the greats - Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Beatles, Bob Dylan, Motown, The Supremes, Jimmy Hendrix, Joanie Mitchell, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Quincy Jones, MJ, Bowie, Grace Jones, Prince, Nina Simone, Patti Smith,Lou Reed, Sade, Cat Stevens, Steely Dan, Led Zepplin, Crosby Stills, Moody Blues, Rolling Stones, Rush, Pink Floyd, Karen Carpenter, Teena Marie, Biggie, A Tribe called Quest, Eminem, Mettalica,\u2026.I could go on.. Too many to list. We have been so fortunate to have had some of the most talented, well produced, polished musicians and producers to grace the planet for nearly 3/4 of a century. Unfortunately great things do end. Turn on top radio today and you may need an extra large vomit bag. Technology affords the average person global information in a split second however the same technology caused the unfortunate death of musical artistry. Current rap, hip hop and pop music is inferior and expectations for quality music are lowered. Current music is an example of societal dumbing down. It's not just the simple, moronic lyrics - ((Drake\u2019s , Wah wah wah, I'm a baby, Lil Pump repeating Gucci Gucci Gucci, but several reasons: No Bass. No instrumentals. With the increase in technology (inception of the Roland 808) recording musicians have become obsolete. This is to be expected. However, everything being electronic there are many options to orchestrate various sounds. Trap uses only a synthesized, simplistic, repetitive beat instrumental (cymbal) without change up throughout the entire track. The beginning of the track sounds like the middle which sounds like the end. Quality music takes you on a journey. Instrumentals, whether acoustic or electronic, add dimension, orchestration, layering and movement both grand and subtle. Where is the soul, funk, grove inspired bass, piano, strings, sax, complex drum beats\u2026? Current music is reduced to a simple formula that goes nowhere.2. Obsessive use of Auto tune. If the entire collection of mainstream performers are using robotic voice alteration where are the performers who dare sound different? Trappers sound nauseatingly mainstream using autotune because it is used in every single snipiet of millenial pop tunes. Cher introduced the unappealing sound in the late 90\u2019s with\u201d I Beleive\u201d(a terrible song) which set off a cascade of obsessive application. Katy Perry could easily produce a rap song. Everything in hip hop, rap, trap, pop and country sound alike. Difficult to differentiate. 3. Inability to evoke emotions. No soul. Current music is one dimensional and therefore unable to engage listeners. One dimensional music has no intro, complex rhythm, quality back up vocals, harmonizing or song sampling. It is simple, thin, dull, low on creativity, generic, watered down and mind numbing. The only emotion it may produce in a listener is \u201cResting Bitch Face\" , boredom or emotional constipation. The exceptions being Childish Gambino's,\u201d This is America,\u201d both song and video, Kendric Lamar\u2019s music and Jayden Smith. The rest is agonizing. 4. No vocal command. Old school rappers such as GrandMaster Flash, Dr. Dre, Notorious BIG, Tupac, NWA, House of Pain, Nas (The world is Yours), Eminem, to name a few, empowered a generation with a clear , confrontational vocal command which inspired listeners to pay close attention. New rappers have as much presence and command as a tasteless saltine cracker. The message isn\u2019t clear nor interesting and without substance. Of course a new generation of artists need to seperate themselves from previous artists however this attempt to do so is a very poor one. The combination of autotune vocals mixed with unintelligible lyrics produces a flat, inauthentic sound. They are not worthy of wiping the ass of the originators of rap. 5. Lack of authenticity. Old school rappers were fresh, bold and innovative. Almost all came from difficult lives of poverty and drug culture which served to bolster their emergence. They created a whole cultural trend that largly influenced society including fashion and lifestyle. They had a persona that shaped their musical creation and many created their own record labels to gain control of their craft. Trap crappers are given record deals not for talent or originality but to feed the tasteless preferences of a generation of digital junkies that failed to create new, exciting culture changing music the way previous generations have. Trap and pop is the slop the masses are being served by the music industry business interests. Today's selection or creation of music is based on computer algorithms. These studies show that sheeple prefer mundane, simple, repetitive music because it reinforces feelings of emotional safety. The music industry prefers low risk and minimal expense which means zero cultivation of talent. It is more efficient to dissect your listening habits. Where is that barf bag? Millennials, take a moment away from Twitter to grasp your willingness of being a control lab rat. HandMaid Tale brainwashing of mediocre music, written, crafted and engineered by business interests. Perhaps you should demand better. It may grease the wheels of change. Unfortunately I'm not hopeful. The music business is determined to undermine the art. 6. No social value. Not speaking to the exceptions listed in #3 but for to the majority of current performers, their content lacks substance and value. Music with depth becomes timeless and aging generations hold onto it because it contains a blueprint of sound and memories. Previous generations of artists speak through their music. This communication is most effective. Music doesnt always need to have a meaningful message but when it does it serves to move us forward even if it makes some uncomfortable. \u201cThis is America\u201dcaused everyone to pause and think. The only thing remembered by lovers of current music will be: Can you believe we thought that was good? Today, anyone without talent is capable of producing a top selling song armed with a laptop, dribble cup, nursery rhymes and a simple back beat. Dumbed down music loses the ability to hold a platform for the next generation to creativly evolve the art. Let rap Rest In Peace. The peak for this genre was reached 20 years ago. The following is a quick rhyme starter that could possibly earn me millions if I'm a 20 year old talentless male who traded sexual favors for short lived stardom. You may apply any current trap beat slowed down or sped up! Yo yo here we go- Ennie meenie minee mo, catch a rapper wit his ho, if he holla, yo yo yo then give dat rapper lotsa doe (I may have just given Lil Pump,his next song inspiration) Any beginning nursery rhyme will do- Mary had a little lamb her fleece as white as snow or Yabba dabbado My Ho be feelin' blue\u2026.ect.. Current music is neither intellectually or creativley stimulating. I, along with my peers, cling to the past but also starve for a new and exciting sound because as listeners we've been spoiled long before now. Sadly, good, accessible music is becoming obscure while bad music and mediocre performers,created by image makers, -thrive. Bad music appeals to dim witted, unsophisticated, technologically distracted people. The same ones attending a dance event obsessively taking selfies yet barely dancing. Our computers are getting warpspeed smart while the human brain is not empowered, utilized or researched enough. Increased automation in every aspect of life creates a dull, lazy, unproductive society. If you want to be inspired and get back some IQ points do not watch the news, do not watch network TV and don't listen to current popular music. ",
