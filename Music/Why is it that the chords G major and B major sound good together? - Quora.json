            "answer_text": "Hold on. \u201c sound good together , as in played at the same time? Played sequecially, you can do anything in this day and age. it just matters what you do to resolve it, etc. where you go with it. Gmaj and Bm remain in the scale , and generally considered to sound pleasant but it is opinion when G and B sound good together. it is an opinion and no rights or wrongs. Are you sure you\u2019re a playing 1 3 5 degrees in both Chords? If so, in a trational sense, that wouldnt have been something to do. That was not a sound a human was accustomed to hearing. A Tritone was \u201cthe devil is music\u201d Such as Wagner\u2019s \u2018'Tristan chord\u201d or Italian 6th and German 6chords. We were not accustomed to hearing chords rsolve that way. beethoven\u2019s Eroica changed music forever including a note in the opening theme considered a sour note and it was not in they key. But that creates tention and demands resolution which is pleasant. BuT it has become normal and sounds good to us. Back then? No. Then, people like Igor,Stravinsky, Charles Ives\u2026. All brought sounds that were offensive to most ears. Schoenberg atonal music and tone rows? No one is tapping their their toes whistling the catchy themes. This was about doing something new, condering music as a \u201csonic event for contemplation.\u201d So \u201csounding good is opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I do not agree. If you play those together (= simultaneously) they sound awful, and that is because played together you get the notes g b d d# f#, and the d-d# is an awful strong dissonant. Also, those chords do not \u201cbelong\u201d in the same key even. In the key of G I would expect a B minor chord, not a B major. G and Bm sound very good together, just like C and Em or F and Am - etcetera. In fact, playing those chords simultaneously gives you the major 7 version of the first chord: G-Bm > g-b-d-f# (g-b-d is G and b-d-f# is Bm) = Gmaj7 If you meant to ask why it sounds good to play a B major after a G major, well, I\u2019d say that is your perception. Others may not find it sounding particularly good, or they may choose other major chords that are a third apart, such as C and E, or F and A, or even Bb and D. Those chords can sound good in a progression because it is sort of an unexpected sidestep from the actual key. It can add tension and interestingness. ",
