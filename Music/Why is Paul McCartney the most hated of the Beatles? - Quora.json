            "answer_text": "I am sad to write this, but it was John actually the most hated of the Beatles. He was insolent, made stupid declarations, awakened controversy and even hate whenever he opened his mouth after 1966 and finally he was\u2026 killed by a hater. Paul is alive and he still fills stadiums. John could not even get a record company release his last album Double Fantasy, and once the album came out it had mediocre sales. Death benefited John because people love martyrs. After his death, Double Fantasy went back to the charts, and gave John his only number one single ever (excepting Whatever gets you thru the night, an Elton John song, who was in the zenith of his fame at the time) and DF became a classic and John was taken to the altars. His death represented the end of a dream and a romantic era. But it was not like that when John was alive and made his bed- ins, appeared naked and drunk in the cover of his solo \u201calbums\u201d, and abandoned his son and wife for his lover \u2014and later wife\u2014 Yoko Ono. No disrespect to Yoko. No one liked John when he spent months drunk and stoned in the company of Nilsson and friends. Films of John Lennon walking in 1980 in NYC show that people simply ignore him. What would they have done had Paul McCartney of the Wings appeared shaking hands in 5th Avenue? As for hate for Paul, who in the world said he is hated? Let\u00b4s see the statistics, the multiple number one singles and albums, and the concert tickets sold, and compare them with the other beatles (God bless Ringo, no offence to you). Now, if people hate McCartney, then they have a strange way to show it. Ah, but it\u00b4s \u201ccool\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d to say that Lennon was the \u201ctrue genius\u201d of the Beatles, and it\u00b4s \u201ccool\u201d to say that Paul only wrote silly love songs and was just the pretty face in the band. The truth is Paul was, since their first massive appearance in the early 60s, the most loved beatle (and don\u00b4t forget Ringo). John\u00b4s mystic began on that horrible day of December of 1980.

            "answer_text": "I think that Paul is becoming relatively more popular with the passing of the generations. Many from the Silent and Baby Boom Generations first knew Paul as a Beatle. Those who came to love The Beatles during the 1960s wanted a semblance of the group in the 1970s when Ringo, John, Paul, and George went about the their artistic ambitions. Paul was the first to release a solo album after Abbey Road, The Beatles\u2019 last all-group effort, in 1970, and his next outing in 1971, Ram, identified his wife, Linda, as his collaborator. Many will say that it was because of Linda that Paul was momentarily the least liked, because she was perceived as a bit of a hindrance to his creative genius. In retrospect, I have wondered about that, since John was already doing pet projects with Yoko before The Beatles broke up. I would concede that George\u2019s solo material was most in line with the roots of the Fab 4. He made frequent homages to blues artists from the very start of his career to his death. If there was any change on his part, it would be that Bob Dylan became more of an influence; however, that did not seem to substantially change his style of play or the kind of company he kept. When George was at his best, he was brilliant; even at his worst, he was still pretty good. As for Paul, I feel that the older audiences looked to him primarily to somehow continue The Beatles\u2019 sound. However, I believe that Paul was the one to distance himself the most from what fans and critics expected. And guess what. Paul McCartney ended up becoming the most successful ex-Beatle. In fact, he won new followers; even some who did not like The Beatles in particular found a love for Paul McCartney and Wings, and Paul McCartney the solo artist. All in all, I would say that Paul was the most hated of The Beatles, because he was also the most popular. Sometimes the most popular winners in life are also the ones most people want to see lose. As time has passed, those who did not like Paul then seem to now be singing a different tune, so to speak. When many of them hear what is played on radio stations today, they will respond, \u201cThis is a number-one hit? Really?? I will choose the worst of Paul McCartney over this garbage any day!!\u201d ",
