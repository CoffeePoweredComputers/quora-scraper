            "answer_text": "Nothing. I ignore them. To each his/ her own. This question is provoking more hate talk. There Are those who accuse others of being haters when in fact they like Michael\u2019s music but they do not like a lot of the decisions Michael made in life, especially with the drugs, which of course ended up killing him. I am not sure this is a sincere question as one of the answers is a directed personal attack on people \u201cwho ask and answer their own questions and are twisted wanna be psychologists\u201d . I\u2019m pretty sure the questioner Marina is referring to me, as this has become a vendetta, but I am not a wanna be. I was a nurse, and a psych nurse as well, thankfully retired. I didn\u2019t see that she had any credentials to ask and answer this question which is exactly what Marina has done here. Then she answers with her usual hostility and disgusting language to other Quora users. I don\u2019t think Michael would have liked it . It means she is provoking people on Quora and using Quora as a personal debate and attack site. Below is a screen shot of the log where she asks and answers her own question here which is merely provoking other users to engage in hate talk . It\u2019s available to everyone under Stats. I don\u2019t understand the benefits of personally attacking other users or being nasty and vulgar to them in the cause of loving Michael Jackson. I read a comment on another question where she attacked another user( not me) of \u201cwriting and reading about mj and pretending to like him but hates him because he is a legend and she is a NOBODY\u201d . When the person complained of the hate talk Marina commented \u201cI was right you are a NOBODY \u201c Quora is an information sharing site, not a fandom site so this line of questioning is not appropriate. If you want to trash other users go to a fandom site. People who talk like that to others create a toxic fan community that's best avoided, which is why I do. A lot of people you think are haters just disagree with a very toxic fandom community that had sprung up around Mj deification . So i think its time to take a break as personal vendettas on a topic are boring and pointless. I met Michael Jackson briefly twice in life. I was married to someone who worked in theater in NYC for 22 years who introduced me . Michael didn\u2019t seem hate worthy, he seemed kinda sweet if you met him briefly in a casual way, but he did seem a bit crazy. But so do half the people in NYC so not exactly a big deal. Below are the stats. Provoking others     Speaking of haters..this is no way to answer a question. What a hypocrite!!! Damn!!      Haters:   ",

            "answer_text": "Haters gonna hate! I don\u2019t mind if people don\u2019t like his music, everyone\u2019s got different tastes. But I just HATE it when: you present them with factual evidence and they just deny it. Stating their one and only argument \u201coh but you think it\u2019s normal for a grown ass man to sleep with children on the same bed\u201d it\u2019s like they refuse to look into both sides of the story, instead, they stay entitled to their own opinion.Some of them go to any length to ridicule and trash him, by making offensive memes, films (u know that scene in SM3) videos, video games (u know what I\u2019m talking about) to creating sites that are dedicated to prove his guilt (again, u know that one). I get that you think he\u2019s guilty, you have your reasons, I have mine, but it hurts to see people making a joke out of him. It\u2019s unecessary.They\u2019re calling us -fans- peadophile enablers/ apologists, when they\u2019re the peadophile enablers themselves. Believing in Michael\u2019s guilt, is believing in Victor Gutirrez\u2019s narrative of normalizing peadophilia, and thus, supporting peadophiles.When asked about Michael Jackson, they only recall bad things. I\u2019m pretty sure that the only images printed in their head about MJ are the tabloid edited ones, in their mind, he\u2019s a freak, a monster, w**ko j**ko, a weirdo\u2026So sad. Get a life and stop hating.The \u201cI used to be a fan but after watching the doco I can no longer defend him\u201d folks. No, just no. If you were a true fan, you would at least try to look into both sides? Do some research instead of jumping to conclusion? Whatever, glad you left the fandom, we don\u2019t need tabloid hoarders like you anyways.They only think of Michael as a paedophile who got away with it. They act as if they know Michael personally and are 100% sure of his guilt, they\u2019d be like \u201che did it, it\u2019s hard to believe but I\u2019m certain he did it\u201d wtf? How would you know that? Your guts? Unless you have some strong evidence that you won\u2019t mind sharing with us? Meanwhile, we are 100% sure of his innocence, and that\u2019s because we have all evidence and facts to back it up.Then there are those who hate him because of his appearence, eccentric behavior\u2026regardless of false charges. I don\u2019t deal with those people, and I don\u2019t have to. There\u2019s no point in arguing with them or forcing them to like MJ no no no. Michael made mistakes, yes, some stupid mistakes. He\u2019s no angel or saint, he\u2019s not a devil either. He\u2019s a human being. You can say whatever you wanna say about him, just don\u2019t accuse him of molesting kids, you\u2019re striking a nerve there. (For me at least) ",
