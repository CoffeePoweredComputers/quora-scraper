            "answer_text": "TL:DR - Use Chord Pulse and Audacity. I have created some tracks for existing songs:  As well as original backings:  And even some unique compositions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9l9Ioehnachttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fryBPfUTR9s So, if you want to have backing tracks for singing or instruments, follow different YouTube channels (including mine haha) and download Chord Pulse. You can always find backing tracks on YouTube or record your own instruments. You can search for the backing track without a specific instrument or vocals, or you can search for something called master tracks - if a song has bass, two guitars and drums alongside with vocals, you can search for separate master tracks for bass, one guitar, the second guitar and drums, download those with a YT to MP3 converter, then combine them in a software like audacity. You are essentially doing a puzzle and it takes some time but it gives much better results than simply using a software to remove vocals which kills the quality of the overall song. Now, maybe you want to create your own backing tracks with only software. One really good and easy software for that is Chord Pulse. You can choose the chords, tempo and tonality and set it up to be exactly as the song you want. Then you can choose from preset styles which change the instruments. It is really intuitive and easy to use if you have very basic musical theory knowledge. ",
