            "answer_text": "Clarinet players are lucky. They are under no pressure to use vibrato. The clarinet player gets to decide when vibrato will make things sound better. If you listen carefully you will notice that clarinet players use vibrato very tastefully - and usually one note (or less) at a time. In contrast, string players and opera singers seem to be taught that vibrato is good and more vibrato is better. If you enjoy vibrato for the sake of vibrato, I am not going to tell you to stop enjoying yourself. I happen to prefer the clarinet-players\u2019 approach to vibrato. ",

I feel that too much vibrato can get boring but I remember using it when I played but it was never expected of me. ",
