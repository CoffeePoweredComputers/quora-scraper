            "answer_text": "Freddie Mercury did not tell his bandmates about his HIV/AIDS diagnosis for two years. According to several sources, Freddie told his Queen bandmates about it over dinner in Montreux in May 1989. Jim Hutton: \u201cSomeone at the table was suffering from a cold, and the conversation got \u2018round to the curse of illness. It was then that Freddie, who still looked fairly well, rolled up his right trouser leg and raised his leg to the table to let the others see the painful, open wound weeping on the side of his leg. 'You think you've got problems,' he told them. 'Well, look at this.' Then just as quickly as he had mentioned it, Freddie brushed the subject aside.\u201d Brian May: \u201cWe kind of knew for a long time, very, very gradually, because the signs began to be there, and there came a day when he just said, 'Look, you've probably figured out what I'm dealing with. I have this thing, and as far as I know there's no cure and I only have a certain amount of time left. I want to have this conversation, I want life to carry on exactly as it is, I want to make records, I don't want anyone to know, I don't want anyone to talk about it from this point forwards and that's it. He knew that if he did announce it his life would become a circus and he would be prevented from going about his business, which was making music. He wanted it to be business as usual until the end.\" Roger Taylor: \u201cWe knew he was terribly ill; it was really only a confirmation of what we'd guessed. But actually hearing it was an appalling thing. For quite a long time we tried to tell ourselves it was other things.\u201d Brian May: \u201cHe never asked for sympathy from anyone else. He was a very strong person and always liked to be in control of his own destiny. He knew that if he did announce it his life would become a circus and he would be prevented from going about his business, which was making music. He wanted it to be business as usual until the end. There was no drama, no tears in his eyes. He was incredibly self-contained. We didn't feel we could speak about it to anyone. It was particularly hard lying barefacedly to our friends. And, of course, we had to stand by and watch this incredibly talented, strong man, in the prime of his life, gradually wasting away. There was a terrible feeling of helplessness.\u201d Speaking to the Sunday Times Brian May said: \"Freddie Mercury didn't want to discuss his condition with the other memebers of the band initially - but they were aware of the gravity of his illness\". Brian's interview to the Daily Mirror in May 2002:\"And the memories of those times when he was in pain have faded a bit. He coped incredibly with his illness. He never, ever complained about it in my hearing. He was always, like 'Oh, f*** it, this is what I have. Don't let's talk about that. We'll get on and do some music.\" At the same time Freddie parted his close friend in 1990 after a question about AIDS. Peter Straker recalls: \"We had lunch and he was quite blotchy and he had make-up on, and we went upstairs and we were sitting down watching telly on his bed and I said to him, 'Have you got AIDS?' and he said, 'No, I haven\u2019t got AIDS!' And I said, 'If there\u2019s anything wrong with you, I\u2019m always here for you,' and we parted that evening. That was the last time I saw him.\u201d \u201cWe all knew there wasn\u2019t much time left,\u201d May told The Telegraph in 2013. \u201cFreddie wanted his life to be as normal as possible. He obviously was in a lot of pain and discomfort. For him, the studio was an oasis, a place where life was just the same as it always had been. He loved making music, he lived for it. He was pursued by the press and curious people. He just wanted peace and quiet, to be able to get on with what he did. He just kept saying, \u2018Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.\u2019 He had no fear, really... We were all wondering if it was an illusion and he was going to be cured. You can\u2019t really take these things in properly. Then we got the phone call. It was surreal. Even though we had been preparing for such a long time, it still didn\u2019t feel possible. We all got together and talked and had a drink and then saw it announced on the TV. Strangely enough, that was when it seemed real for the first time. You thought, \u2018Oh my God, he really has gone and everybody knows now. It can\u2019t be taken back.'\u201d ",
