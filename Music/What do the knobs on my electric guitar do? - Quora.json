            "answer_text": "I presume you\u2019re referring to the knobs on the BODY of the guitar and not elsewhere; I\u2019m repeating the previous answers by pointing out their technically correct functions as represented on MOST guitars: volume and, possibly, tone. To be strict, the knobs actually don\u2019t DO anything - you have to turn them and their effects are only apparent when the guitar is plugged into something and you can hear amplified output - either through speakers or headphones. Almost all guitars will have at least one VOL knob. Traditionally this is attributed to adjusting the VOLume of the guitar signal - the amount of signal going to the amplification system. You, the player, control it. What I mean by \u201cAlmost all guitars\u201d is that, in some special cases, there are guitars without a volume - they\u2019re \u201cwired wide open\u201d for specific purposes usually to do with studios. Most guitars will have at least one TONE knob - a way to adjust the frequency spread of the signal going to the amplification system. Similar to a TONE adjustment on radios, stereos, other things; it usually is a means to adjust how much of the higher frequencies are sent to the output. Rolling the knob \u201cback\u201d will reduce the higher frequencies and can help make the guitar sound less \u201cshrill\u201d if it exhibits that tendency. Here\u2019s another way to look at these knobs: \u201cVOL\u201d has many practical definitions: VOLume of Annoyance - it\u2019s a way to adjust how much an (involuntary?) audience is subjected to the sounds of your guitar. Dial it up, the more annoyed they are. Remember that you\u2019re also a member of that audience.VOLuntary arrest: when the volume-of-annoyance has passed a sufficient threshold, authorities tend to show up and pass \u201cfriendly reminders\u201d to you about the cost of said annoyance.\u201cVOLuptuocity\u201d - a whack term where, upon mastering the subtle effects of changing the volume, the resulting desired effect on the target of your playing - possibly a love interest.\u201cTONE\u201d is really mislabeled - \u201cTON\u201d might be more appropriate: TONs of shrillness - sometimes a really \u201ctrebly\u201d guitar sounds cool. Most times it just makes people want to shoot you.TONal Annoyance - see number 1.TONight it\u2019s on - manipulating the TONe knob along with the VOLume knob can assist with the VOLuptuocity intent.FInally, remember that your IMPACT is always greater than your INTENT. Use VOL and TON wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, they are for volume and tone. Most of the time the volume knob will be closest to the bridge pickup/playing position. If a guitar has only one knob, it is almost always a volume control. If it has only two knobs, they are most likely a single volume and a single tone control behind it. For Stratocaster type guitars, there are three knobs; one volume in the aforementioned position and two tone controls behind it. On a Gibson type (like the Les Paul, 335 or SG) there are four knobs, one set of volume and tone controls for each of two pickups. The top two are volume and tone for the neck (Rythm) pickup. The bottom two are for the bridge (Treble) pickup. In the middle switch position, both sets of controls are available. If you have a Gibson type with three pickups the control layout can vary from instrument to instrument. The Epiphone Les Paul SG with three pickups has three volumes (one for each pickup) and a single (or master) tone control just next to the output jack. The Ace Frehley Les Paul (3 pickups) layout is such where the neck (Rythm) pickup is controlled by the top pair, the bridge (Treble) pickup is controlled by the bottom pair and the middle switch position activates the bridge and middle pickups that are controlled by the bottom set (Treble) of knobs. Hamer guitars generally have a 3-control layout. That is a volume control for each of two pickups and a single master tone. The first volume knob is for the neck pick-up. The middle knob is for the bridge pickup. Behind that is the master tone. In the middle switch position all controls can be used. I don't have time to list every possible control layout. If I haven't covered your guitar type, send me a message as to what guitar you have and I can reply to you the control layout you have. ",
