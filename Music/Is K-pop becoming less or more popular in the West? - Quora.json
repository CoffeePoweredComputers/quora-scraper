            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s coasting at the moment. The wave has been coming for a while, and I think when BTS blew up internationally, that was when it truly hit. Now the door\u2019s open for other groups/idols to become mainstream. The BTS hype has hit its peak, as people globally have recognized their talent and success; they\u2019re household names, not an interesting side note at award shows. I mean, did you see their appearance on Jimmy Fallon? They\u2019re actually being taken seriously and respected now. Of course, now that we\u2019re in a pandemic, I don\u2019t think Kpop is going to do much for the next few months. I think the fans that exist will stay fans, but I don\u2019t think more people will get into it in the West; they have much bigger concerns at the moment. My guess is Kpop is going to stay about where it is right now: recognized and (somewhat) respected as a genre of music with global fans. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any bigger, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lose popularity (especially with TikTok.) Cheers~! ",
