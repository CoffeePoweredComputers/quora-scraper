            "answer_text": "A startup is one of the most valuable experiences you can make. If you can and want to do it - go for it.Discuss this with your parents. They probably want to make sure that this does not negatively impact your results in school. Make a plan together so they will support your adventure. It will be a lot easier with them having your back.In most countries you have to reach a certain age to officially found a company. In addition, you will get involved in a lot of boring stuff, like accounting and legal terms. I suggest you avoid these hassles for the first experiments to make sure you really want to do this.Also you should avoid risking investments you can\u2019t recover.I suggest the following approach for the first couple of \u2018customers\u2019: Focus on private customers. You can\u2019t issue invoices which businesses need.Consult them what they need and the best computer setupHave THEM buy the components and ship them to you (so you don\u2019t have to spend the money).Assemble the computers and bring them to them, helping them with installation and training.Ask them for a voluntary \u2018donation\u2019 instead of a service payment. This way you are not officially a business. Be prepared they will ask you what you would consider appropriate. Keep your price very low. You are not yet here to make money, but to get experience and make yourself known. You can introduce prices later on.Once you have the first orders under your belt, decide if you want to go on.Happy starting up ",

            "answer_text": "If you plan to form an actual company that will be buying and selling, it may be worthwhile incorporating. There may also be some liability questions. Which means talking to a lawyer who can draw up the appropriate papers for your jurisdiction. A 13 year old is still legally an infant almost everywhere and you may need a trustee or guardian for the assets of the company. At 18 some jurisdictions would consider you an adult, while others would want you to be 21 before you can control your own company. But if this will be a hobby business, print up your business cards (or do whatever you think is the social media equivalent) and go to it. Some kids at your school are landscaping, you are tech support, have fun and make money. ",

So technically at the age of 18 you can own your company, indeed be a Director. However if the company is not Limited (incorporated) then I beleive the age is 16 for what we call a \u201cSole Trader\u201d (small. unlimited[by shares] business). ",
