Crazy, I know right? And all this time we thought he wasn\u2019t pure (\u2026he still isn\u2019t) Expensive Girl is actually a cover he sang, it was originally made by Pharrell Williams with the original name of \u2018Take It Off\u2019. So BTS members might question RM\u2019s choice of cover song BUT he nailed it and that\u2019s that :) ",
