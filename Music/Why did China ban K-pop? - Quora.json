            "answer_text": "Actually China banned all the activities involving South Korea like Kpop, Korean products, Dramas, and movies which are produced on mutual banners (China - Korea productions) . There are many dramas and movies which are kept on hold to release in which Korean artists are involved. It also banned streaming of South Korean shows & dramas in its country. The main aim of China is to make South Korea economically weak by banning Korean activities in the country because China has huge contribution in South Korean entertainment and product industry. China is not happy about Washington\u2019s agreement with Seoul to build a missile shield system, known as THAAD, in South Korea to protect the close US ally from North Korean attacks. Since South Korea and China share same air and water space, it felt that it would be used against them in future and was completely against it. Other than issuing angry statements, though, China actually can\u2019t do much to stop the installation of the THAAD system. It\u2019s taking its anger out on Korean pop culture instead. From TV dramas to fried chicken, South Korean products are especially popular among young people in China. They\u2019re also one of South Korea\u2019s biggest exports, earning the country a record $5.3 billion in 2014. China is tapping into that popularity in an attempt to hurt South Korea economically.
