            "answer_text": "If you are a radio station broadcasting with the standard broadcaster\u2019s license then you can broadcast songs of any duration. With this license you just pay a monthly fee and then make a record EVERY song you play and how many times you play them. The royalties are distributed to these recording artists based on how many plays they got. But you don\u2019t have to record songs you played less than 30 seconds of. These artists don\u2019t get paid. It is this industrial standard that leads to the general public thinking that they too can use 30 seconds of a song for free. But they can\u2019t. And it isn\u2019t really \u201cfor free\u201d to have the right to do this either, since you are paying your monthly license fee whether you do this or not. Nothing about the radio license affects any other use. You cannot put 15 seconds of a song into a YouTube video, you cannot broadcast 25 seconds of a song on your late night TV show, you cannot perform this song on a stage (unless that stage has a paid \u201cperformance license\u201d).

            "answer_text": "Can you? Yes. Is it legal? Only if you have permission. US radio stations can use short clips from songs without having to pay a royalty. This isn\u2019t because of any law, though: it\u2019s because their contracts with the US agencies that collect song royalties say they can. In other words, they have permission to do so, via those contracts. Unfortunately, a lot of people have heard that radio stations can use a few seconds of a song without having to pay a royalty, and not heard or not understood that this is because of their contracts. They\u2019ve come up with the misinterpretations that (1) there\u2019s a law that allows this (you\u2019ll sometimes see \u201cthe Fair Use Act\u201d mentioned; there is no such thing, Fair Use is part of the Copyright Act) and that (2) this applies to anyone. And then, of course, since specific rumors tend to survive better than general ones, people come up with various numbers of seconds and attach them. So, no. The idea that there\u2019s a certain number of seconds that anyone can use of any song is an urban legend. In actual court cases, people have been found to have committed copyright infringement for using as little as three notes of a particular song. ",

A copyright claim is not a problem. You cannot ever monetize a music video you don\u2019t own or license. However 20 seconds could be fair use, depending no how it\u2019s used. I would upload it and see what happens. It\u2019s it\u2019s blocked, make it private. You can still share it with up to 25 people. ",
