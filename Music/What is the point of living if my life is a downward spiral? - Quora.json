This reality is an illusion of life experienced as separation. \u201cThe world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, \"Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?\" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, \"Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.\" And we \u2026 kill those people. \"Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.\" It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok \u2026 But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride.\u201d - Bill Hicks \u201call matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.\u201d - Bill hicks ",
