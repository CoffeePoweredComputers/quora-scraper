            "answer_text": "A combination of too many songs for one album and an unwillingness to edit them down is the reason it became a double album. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison found not much spirituality but a lot of inspiration in India with the Maharishi. They came back with armloads of new songs. They had enough clout to record and release whatever they wished, and a double album was just what they wanted, a rock-star move if there ever was one. It was also the beginning of the end for the band\u2019s cohesiveness. Before the trip to India they had recorded a few songs to tide over the market while they were gone. Lady Madonna and Hey Bulldog were both put in the can in these sessions. The production staff later said that this was the last time the Beatles really worked together as a band in the studio. The give and take collaboration and joy they found in making music together was still there. It was also the first time Lennon brought Yoko into the studio, much to the others\u2019 annoyance. The White Album was a symptom of the growing independence of the members. Lennon and McCartney weren\u2019t collaborating much anymore, just presenting their already finished songs for the other to critique. Harrison was increasingly frustrated by the lack of access his songs had. McCartney was becoming insistent about how his songs were played, which ticked off everyone. Lennon\u2019s drug habit included heroin by then. Even Ringo walked away at one point when his drumming was criticized. Despite all of this, maybe because of it, the album turned out gloriously disjointed, with wild changes of mood and downright weirdness that doesn\u2019t exist on any other Beatles album. I think it\u2019s fantastic. ",

            "answer_text": "Why indeed. The short answer is that the Beatles were, at that point, powerful enough to release whatever the hell they wanted to release, and neither their producer nor their label had the power to stop them. By this point in their career, they\u2019d ceased to function as a regular unit, which is why you get silly songs like \u2018Bungalow Bill\u2019 and \u2018Rocky Raccoon\u2019 and Ringo\u2019s forgettable \u2018Don\u2019t Pass Me By\u2019 alongside casual masterpieces like \u2018Long Long Long\u2019 and \u2018Happiness is a Warm Gun\u2019. I think it\u2019s notable that nearly all the best tracks on the White Album came about when they were able to work together: \u2018Happiness is a Warm Gun\u2019 is, in my view, one of the best things they ever did, and it was recorded live in one take; they didn\u2019t record the different parts separately and edit them together. That took serious teamwork. But, they spent a lot of the rest of the time in a huff, working on their own or with one other member, and so there\u2019s a lot of material that would not normally have passed quality control. I am, however, one of the few people who would not want to be without \u2018Revolution Nine\u2019, which for its sheer perversity I think is another of the best things they ever did. The Word of God (and his helper) answers, transcribed from the Beatles\u2019 Anthology documentary, are: George Martin: When they did the White Album\u2026I thought we should have made a very, very good single album out of it, rather than making a double album. Ringo Starr: Well, no, I agree, we should have put it out as two separate albums. The White and the Whiter Album. George Harrison: But, you know\u2026what do you do when you\u2019ve got all them songs, and you wanna get rid of them so you can do, you know, more songs? You know, there was a lot of, uh, you know, ego in that band, and there was a lot of songs that should have just maybe been elbowed or made into B-sides. Paul McCartney: Well, you can always say that, I mean\u2026say, perhaps\u2026I\u2019ll go with\u2026not definitely. I mean, in fact, I think it\u2019s a fine little album. I think that the fact that it\u2019s got so much on it is one of the things that\u2019s cool about it. Cause they\u2019re very varied stuff, you know, \u2018Rocky\u2019, \u2018Piggies\u2019\u2026\u2019Happiness is a Warm Gun\u2019, that kind of stuff. I think it\u2019s a fine album. [pause, smirks] You know, I\u2019m not a great one for that, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s too many of that\u2019, look, what do you mean, it was great, it sold, it\u2019s the bloody Beatles\u2019 White Album! Shut up! Edit: For what it\u2019s worth, my own opinion is that it\u2019s no use wishing history had gone differently. ",
