            "answer_text": "Drown With Me by Porcupine Tree   In short, the song is just beautiful.  To describe it further, it isn't as depressing or sad as it is dark and disturbing with sinister undertones; the creepiness of it is only magnified by the song's cheery and upbeat music. Like many other songs by Porcupine Tree, this one too remains a bit ambiguous about the whole premise and the meaning could be open for interpretation (Steven Wilson usually remains tight-lipped about the meaning of his songs). But in my opinion, on a literal interpretation, the lines are probably from the point of view of a psychotic killer/stalker who wants a girl (with issues) to be dead, drowned under the water, almost as if he'd be happy to liberate her from her woes. When you consider the verses below,   You're drowning in family thereWhen will you come up for air Don't feel you let 'em down'cause they have already drowned it could be assumed that the person is a serial killer who has already \"helped\" some girls before. Or it could be thought that the person has drowned some people who were the cause of the girl's depression and is telling her not to worry about them any more. In either case, it seems like the person is comforting the girl by pointing out that she won't be going alone. Alternatively, the song could be thought of in a positive light from the POV of the girl's lover, coaxing her to forget about her rues. But somehow, I'm not inclined to think of it that way. It doesn't really fit in with the theme of the album. Judge for yourselves. So you have been of useAnd you have been abused You know you look pale todayYour lipstick has gone astray You sold out and lost your looksYou gave away all your booksYou should drown with me Your coil has been wound up tightUnwind it with me tonightYou should drown with me Tyre tracks fresh on the groundWhere she will be found(Held under the water)Resting there in a stream(View from the cold water)Buried in greenOrange filter sky You're drowning in family thereWhen will you come up for airYou should drown with me Don't feel you let 'em down'cause they have already drownedYou should drown with me ",

[Verse 1 - Charlie Scene:]Gone too far and yeah, I'm gone again,It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends,One's a bottle of pills, one's a bottle of gin,I'm 20 stories up, yeah, I'm up at the top,I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,I bet my mamma found my letter, now she's calling the cops,I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,I never bought a suit before in my life,But when you go to meet God, you know you wanna look nice. [Charlie Scene:]So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. [Chorus - Charlie Scene:]My legs are dangling off the edge,The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,My legs are dangling off the edge,A stomach full of pills didn't work again,I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. [Verse 2 - Johnny 3 Tears:]We hit the sky, there goes the light, no more sun, why's it always night?When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,When you can't dream, well, what's life mean?We feel a little pity, but don't empathizeThe old are getting older, watch a young man die,A Mother and a Son and someone you know, smile at each other and realize you don't,You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,Now Mamma feels guilt, yeah, Mamma feels pain,When you were young, you never thought you'd die,Found that you could but too scared to try,You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,Climb to the roof to see if you could fly. [Charlie Scene:]So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. [Chorus - Charlie Scene:]My legs are dangling off the edge,The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,My legs are dangling off the edge,A stomach full of pills didn't work again,I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone. [Ava, Johnny 3 Tears' Daughter:]I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,Like a bird so high,Oh I might just try,I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,Like a bird so high,Oh I might just try,Oh I might just try.
