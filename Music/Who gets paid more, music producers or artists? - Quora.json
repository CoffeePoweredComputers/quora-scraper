            "answer_text": "Woohoo this is a great one! See, it all sort of depends on the Artist at the end of the day. Producers can make a nice chunk of change doing an Album for an Artist. You are looking at a Minimum cost of $25,000.00 If you want a Professional job done. If you want them to actually actively PRODUCE you are looking at $40,000.00 easy. So, if an Artist Invests 35 thousand Dollars into a Project and comes out at a loss, who wins? And that\u2019s only talking Music. Generally Artists now are making money through Merch and Ticket Sales. Streaming Royalties are not going to cut it unless you are streaming World Wide. Being an Artist really is a Business. You have many ways to make money with your work out there, but if your work isn\u2019t taking hold, you need to keep trying. Or in the End, the Producer makes out and you foot the bill. With the Right Team and Deliverance of the Release their chance of success is greater. But as they say, and it\u2019s oh so true: It Takes Money To Make Money And Dedication. Hope this helps a bit!

            "answer_text": "On the top level Max Martin makes the same as Katie Perry or Taylor Swift. Their net worth is around 350+ million. Artists on the whole probably make more. The control over intellectual property is where much of the wealth is. Copyrights and sound recordings ownership etc. As far as \u2018paid\u2019 more\u2026 A-Artists usually go into the stratosphere for an appearance or collaboration. A-level producers when you can get them - maybe 20-$30k to produce a song. On the lower level most artists make more by gigging than new producers - because they have to establish themselves more. The big difference is as an artist you are more or less your own product - A producer might have a much better guarantee of success because they can switch artists or produce multiple artists. ",
