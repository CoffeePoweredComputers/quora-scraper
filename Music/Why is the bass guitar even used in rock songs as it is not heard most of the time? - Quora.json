            "answer_text": "Maybe because many people do not know what an electric bass sounds like. But bass is there in any song. I had a friend who said he didn\u2019t like Come Together by the Beatles as much as the Aerosmith cover because the Beatles version \u201cdidn\u2019t have as much bass\u201d. I was taken aback by that. The Beatles version is all bass, and the cover has more guitar. So he played both for me, and I noted how much more bass the Beatles song had. He said \u201cno, that\u2019s guitar, that fuzzy crunchy riff in Aerosmith\u2019s version is the bass\u201d. It turned out that he had always heard hard rock and metal had a lot more bass so he had just assumed the overdriven guitar riffs he heard in those songs were the bass. And because in the Beatles version Paul is playing in the upper registers, not the low boomy notes, he assumed it was guitar. Now some other people associate bass with the super heavy and booming bass synth. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that either. It\u2019s quite a versatile instrument that can be used in a variety of ways. Any why use it? It provides a strong low end sound to counter guitar and vocals, it can play with the bass drum to tighten the rhythm, it can play bass lines the drive and move the song, it can even solo. While it may not be as obvious in music as a guitar solo or loud drums, it plays a vital part holding the band together, giving a low end punch, keeping the rhythm and providing a unique and enjoyable sound. To hear the bass in action: Come Together by the Beatles (as mentioned above, its not your typical bass line) Bernadette (the 4 Tops) - James Jamerson set the standard for how bass was used, a great, dynamic bass line Shake Hands with Beef (Primus) - not your typical bass playing Heaven and Hell (the Who) - Bass sets the rhythm and takes on the lead Call me Al (Paul Simon) - a funky line with a classic bass solo ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure if you have really bad headphones or speakers or you just don\u2019t have an \u2018ear\u2019 for music. Go to a rock concert and the bass guitar is the thing that makes the whole place shake in a visceral way. The kick drum has a similar but different effect. Synthesized bass lines like in dub step and a lot of modern music replace the bass guitar itself, but they have a similar sound and fill the same part of the audio spectrum. The bottom note on a bass guitar (E) has a frequency of 41.204Hz A lot of modern music goes down to a B below that (30.868Hz) Your average home hifi speaker doesn\u2019t go that low. The response of the speakers often gets quieter from 70 or 80Hz down. Same with cheap ear and head phones (like the ear buds that came with your mobile). Even if speakers/earphone/headphones say they go down to, say, 20Hz, they always allow for a drop-off at the lower frequencies, 10db is usual. So that means 20Hz loudness is about 8 times quieter than maybe the 80Hz signal. They might produce a sound at even 15Hz but it\u2019s so quiet you can\u2019t hear it so they draw the line at 10db drop off usually. So it\u2019s entirely possible you have never heard the lower 2 strings on a bass guitar (it has 4, the second lowest one is A at 55Hz). And newer music has those even lower notes. Take for example Sorrow by Pink Floyd (from way back in the 90s) from the Pulse live album. I saw that live and the intro synth notes were so loud and low that I remember my clothes vibrating against my skin and you could feel it in your throat as well as (obviously) in your stomach. Over many years I\u2019ve played that same track on many, many systems and not heard those thunderous low notes. Then recently I gave my wife a pair of Sony XB650BT headphones and listened. Suddenly the notes were back! I tried listening for comparison with Shure SE215 ear phones, earlier Sony headphones, Sennheiser headphones (not top of the line ones), Sony home theatre (with sub woofer), car stereo (Audi 2016 with Bang & Olufsen sound system & sub woofer), my pc speakers with Jamo subwoofer and in none of these others could I hear (or feel!) the notes. So a key part of the music was completely missing! So you\u2019re right in thinking you can\u2019t hear the bass guitar a lot. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an important part of the music, it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve been missing out. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve seen everything in black and white and you think that\u2019s normal and people should get rid of these \u2018colors\u2019 called red and blue etc as you don\u2019t see them and figure they can't be useful. But try seeing the world in color and you\u2019ll realise what you\u2019ve been missing! That\u2019s just an example, but most pop/rock music (including metal, dubstep, dance etc) these days (as in the last 30 years or so) has these low notes - and bass guitar has been around since the 1930s and bass cello (the double bass, which it replaced) has been around for 400 years. The production studio and musicians didn\u2019t usually put in those low notes (lower than the bass guitar) in the older days as no-one could hear them except if you went to a night club (that has decent speakers) or a live concert (the Pink Floyd example above was an early exception). Now with better sub woofers and headphones end users can hear those notes so now they\u2019re being used in the music. A chicken and egg problem. There is also a small possibility you have a medical condition (otosclerosis) that means you cannot hear the bass notes, though this is pretty rare. EDIT: Some people have noted that the bass guitar can produce harmonics at higher frequencies that can be heard by your average speakers. This depends on how the string is plucked, what effects pedals are used, and what amplification is used. The original double-bass was always finger plucked and hence had very little in the way of higher frequency harmonics. Bass guitars are often played with a pick which induces (predominately) odd harmonics that can be several octaves higher - this is often enhanced by modifying the settings of the bass guitar amplifier or at the mixing desk (when playing live or in a recording studio) to increase the higher frequencies (6kHz or higher) which makes the bass guitar sound \u201cbrighter\u201d and \u201cmore clear\u201d. Then if it is plucked but allowed to hit the fretboard in a percussive manner (\u201cslap bass\u201d) then even more higher frequencies are produced. Finally, distortion pedals and amplifiers that impart distortion are common today. These add frequencies right up to 2k, 4k and even higher. Bass plucked with fingers (not plectrum) has a \u201cround\u201d or more mellow/smooth/muddy sound with few higher harmonics. Examples are Keep the Faith by Bon Jovi where the bass is the primary instrument for the first 30 seconds. Another is Glasgow Kiss by John Petrucci where the bass is very lively and a critical part of the music but is virtually inaudible above the fundamental notes played. Happy Little Pill by Troy Sivan has synth bass that is initially \u201crounded\u201d and inaudible on lesser speakers until the 40 second mark when it becomes distorted, adding upper harmonics, and hence becomes more audible. Try listening to Walk on Water by 30 Seconds to Mars with sub 80Hz removed by parametric equaliser (or cheap earphones) and it becomes very \u201cthin\u201d as the synth bass using sub bass guitar frequencies is key to the musical content of the whole song. The other extreme is Tool (Sobre or Vicarious as examples) where the bass is distorted and covers a much broader range of the audio spectrum. There are many, many more examples of course: these are but a handful to exemplify the points made. Note also the use of so many different words to describe the sounds of the bass. The same sound can make very different impressions on how it is perceived by different people. Hence some might call a bass guitar with few upper harmonics \u201crounded\u201d some might call it \u201cmuddy\u201d and other might call it \u201cquiet\u201d. It\u2019s the same sound, but what you\u2019re used to listening to affects our perception. Guaranteed when a bass player listens to music they will pick out the bass line and be very aware of how it is being played whilst another person may not even notice it at all. It\u2019s still there and still a very important \u201ccolour\u201d in the total musical \u201cpicture\u201d. ",
