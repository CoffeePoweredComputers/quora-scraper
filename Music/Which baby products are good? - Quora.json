            "answer_text": "Regardless, you generally need the best for your infant. Directly from the diaper, the infant would wear to the school the individual in question would go to \u2013 you generally plan the best for them. What's more, with regards to picking child items, picking only one is so befuddling. There are various brands selling baby care items, each professing to be the best \u2013 it's anything but difficult to get confounded. You all of a sudden end up going to an ocean of online audits, posing inquiries in gatherings, counseling specialists and taking proposals! Indeed, let me make your life somewhat simpler! Here's a rundown of the best infant item I would suggest Bey Bee and Oyobaby Brands products for your baby. Rash cream: Buy a good quality diaper rash cream and keep it handy. Use it based on instructions from your baby\u2019s pediatrician.Wet wipes(Water wipes): Cleaning your newborn baby\u2019s bottom needs to done gently and hygienically. Wet wipes let you retain the moisture in your baby\u2019s skin while leaving the area clean and smelling fresh.Mosquito net: You can never be too careful when it comes to mosquitoes around your newborn baby. A mosquito net along with an ultrasonic mosquito repellent can protect your baby from bites and diseases.Baby monitor: If your baby has a nursery to sleep in, you will need a baby monitor from a good company, which will help you keep an eye on your sleeping child. Ensure it is the rechargeable kind, which is more long-lastingDisposable diapers: Avoid buying diapers in bulk. Instead, buy sample packs of 3 brands and try each on the baby. Depending on the most comfortable brand, buy the remaining in bulk for your newborn baby. These diapers come in handy during outdoor visits.Cotton nappies: Reusable cotton nappies are a safe option on sensitive baby skin. However, these nappies need to be changed soon as they are soiled, which requires you to stock up on them so that you don\u2019t run out before you can toss them in the laundry.Baby wash & shampoo: Tear-free, mild, fragrance-free shampoos and baby wash is a must-have. Buy a small bottle and check how it reacts with your newborn baby\u2019s skin before stocking up.Massage & hair oil: You can use traditional oils such as almond or coconut oil to massage your newborn baby. If you are buying bottled oils, get the gentle, organic-based ones, or check with your baby\u2019s doctor for recommendations.Baby cream: Moisturise your newborn\u2019s skin with a good baby cream that needs to be applied after every bath. Do a patch test on your baby before applying it all over the body.",

            "answer_text": "No matter what, you always want to choose the best for your baby. But when it comes to selecting baby skincare products, picking just one is so very confusing. You unexpectedly find yourself turning to a sea of online reviews, taking recommendations and consulting doctors. Well, allow me to make your life a bit easier. Here are a few tips for you before you start shopping a skincare product: Read labels very carefully- Labels should be read carefully to make sure the Baby skin care products do not contain fragrances, dyes and chemicals. These can irritate a baby's skin and impact baby\u2019s breathing.Opt for Natural and organic baby skin care products-Natural and organic skin care products are the safest and healthiest for your little ones. They are extracted directly from plant products as opposed to being produced synthetically.Prefer \"hypoallergenic\" products-Hypoallergenic means that the product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. These products are therefore, gentler to the skin than non-hypoallergenic skincare products.Look for phthalate- and paraben-free products- Phthalate and Paraben are chemicals that are harmful for the skin of the baby and have been linked to a number of serious health concerns.Nuluv has U.S baby skincare brands that are natural, organic, hypoallergenic, phthalate and paraben free; not comprising fragrances, dyes and chemicals. Baby skin care products Here is my list of essential baby products: Baby Wash Make baby\u2019s bath time fun by using a tear-free body wash. The body wash should be free of chemicals and should cleanse the baby\u2019s body naturally. You should look for natural ingredients that gently clean and simultaneously moisturize your baby\u2019s skin. Baby Shampoo Your baby\u2019s shampoo should be like the body wash; safe and tear-free that gently cleans your baby\u2019s scalp and hair. A baby shampoo with organic ingredients is chemical free, safe and natural and leaves scalp and hair shiny and clean. Baby Lotion For restoring and replenishing the natural oils of the baby\u2019s body, baby lotion needs to be applied after bath. You should pick an effective baby lotion having richness of ingredients like chamomile, calendula, Shea Butter, Olive Fruit Oil and Vitamin E. All of these combat your baby\u2019s dry skin and restore the lost moisture, keeping the baby\u2019s skin smooth and soft. Natural Baby Powder Your baby\u2019s folds should be kept dry for preventing them from rubbing and causing skin irritation. Choose Organic Aloe and Chamomile based talc-free baby powder which is safe for your baby\u2019s skin and keeps your baby dry and cool. Diaper Rash Cream Every time diaper of your baby is changed, you need to make sure diaper rash cream is applied. Diaper cream protects the baby\u2019s bottom from allergies and rashes. An itchy and sore bottom can make the baby uncomfortable and cranky the entire day. Diaper cream however; acts as a protective barrier against skin infections and wetness. You should look for the presence of Zinc Oxide in diaper cream because it is natural and it acts fast on rashes. Natural Sunscreen The American Association of Pediatrics recommend the usage of sunscreen for babies below 6 months and older. Apply natural mineral-based baby sunscreen specially formulated for babies. Also, check the ingredients to make sure that the sunscreen is organic. Your baby\u2019s skin being delicate needs to be protected against harsh environmental conditions. At Nuluv, we ensure your baby\u2019s safety by providing the best skin care. We have chosen the U.S skincare brands, Babo Botanicals and Nature\u2019s Baby Organics, for your newborn\u2019s skin care safety. Both these brands have natural and organic products comprising certified ingredients to ensure your baby\u2019s delicate skin is well-shielded against allergies, and remains healthy forever. ",
