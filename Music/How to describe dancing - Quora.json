            "answer_text": "Dancing is made up of very liberating movements. Every type of dance is creating a certain kind of illusion for the viewer. Dance is 80% confidence. I can do the moves but personally really sells the performance. Personal Anecdote: I have always loved hip hop like thug hip hop if that makes sense because I was a Tom boy. When I came out as gay, I started being girlier again. My favorite thing became learning very sexual dances because I am learning them in an environment where I won\u2019t be objectified. It felt so empowering. When someone dances in a sexual way, I don\u2019t think about I want to bang that person, I think that person has successfully created that illusion or persona or I think that person loves themselves like is truly feeling themselves.

            "answer_text": "To describe dancing is easy for me because I love dancing! Listen to the music, let it go through your body, feel it in your soul, and your body will get the hint and move to the music. I would also describe dancing as a great workout, extremely fun to do, it burns a lot of calories, makes me smile, puts me in a good mood, raises my vibration to bring more positivity into this world on this earth, act as a show of celebration, and much much more. I suggest that everybody go dance their asses off! ",
