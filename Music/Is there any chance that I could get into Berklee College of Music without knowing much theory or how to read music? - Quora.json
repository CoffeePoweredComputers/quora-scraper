            "answer_text": "It\u2019s definitely possible. As far as I remember, there is no music theory entrance test. You\u2019re only tested after you arrive at Berklee at the beginning of your first semester to determine what level of theory/harmony class you should be placed in - and there are theory classes that start at the very beginning. Sight-reading, however, is tested at the entrance audition, and Berklee considers it a fairly important skill. Thing is, Berklee is open-minded. They know there are amazing musicians out there who don\u2019t know how to sight-read. Not to feed the stereotype, but usually they\u2019re singer-songwriters who aren\u2019t classically-trained, or they\u2019re rock/pop/electronic musicians. Berklee wants a healthy population of singer-songwriters and rock/pop/electronic musicians, and they know that they often haven\u2019t had formal instrumental or theoretical training, so they tend to make allowances for those types of players and accept them. However, you should know that Berklee rarely affords such musicians any kind of substantial scholarship, unless they\u2019re a ridiculously stellar performer. Barring that, unless you\u2019re willing to work VERY hard and learn quickly - you will lose respect at Berklee. There\u2019s a veritable army of untrained musicians who lose patience with Berklee\u2019s insistence on their learning theory and the clear low priority they hold among the student body - and they usually end up dropping out after the first year or semester. That, along with the high cost of attendance, is why Berklee has such a high dropout rate for a music school. By all means, audition, and do your best. If you\u2019re good, you\u2019ll get in. However, be aware of what environment you\u2019re entering. If you rise to the challenging work Berklee gives you, if you can deal with not being at the top of the hierarchy at first, and if you can take the acquisition of theoretical knowledge seriously, you\u2019ll become an exponentially better player before you know it, and you\u2019ll become a thriving member of a huge community of inspiring musicians. Berklee is, after all, one of the greatest music schools in existence, despite its inconsistencies and injustices. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth the try. PS EDIT - Just watched your Instagram video of you on the guitar. You\u2019re a sensitive player with good tone. You\u2019ve got a good shot. And yeah, you could learn a lot at Berklee. All of the above still applies, but it\u2019s definitely worth it for you to apply and audition. Best of luck, man. ",

            "answer_text": "You definitely can get into Berklee without previous study of theory and reading. However, be prepared to learn it there in record time. If you can, get your hands on notation books and try to get someone to give you some tutoring before you attend. Having more musical knowledge helps you stand out as a musician and there is a sightreading aspect to your audition that will help you just that much more if you do well. But Berklee is looking at the whole picture - what you\u2019ve done, how you sound, how you play, and what your goals are. A drummer who is going to be music production or music business has less worry with regard to music theory than does a pianist or horn player who wants to be a film scoring major. But EVERY student needs to gain these skills and fast once enrolled. ",
