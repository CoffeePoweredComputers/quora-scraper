But I think that the most likely reason of all May have been that his heart was two sizes too small. How the Grinch Stole ChristmasStraight from the Doc, that\u2019s the most likely reason. Now, as an exercise on its own, there\u2019s other opinions to be had- the Jim Carrey version added a contrived love triangle angle, the Cumberbatch one had a more relatable Grinch who seemed to mostly hate the overbearing cheer- and to be honest, I tend to quite like the idea that the Grinch is too cynical to think of Christmas as anything but sheer crass materialism until the climax of the story when the Whos celebrate with nothing.

In the movies, its been tinkered with. In the 2000 Jim Carrey movie of the same name, it was suggested that he had antisocial tendencies and after a severe public humiliation, became the evil outcast of Whoville. In The Grinch, its back to being about a heart two sizes too small. And about him being lonely. Christmas became the focus of his animosity because that was the one time when he was the least part of humanity. And the best time to to get even. ",
