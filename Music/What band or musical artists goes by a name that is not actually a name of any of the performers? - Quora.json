The name came from a rumor that Paul McCartney checked into hotel rooms with the name \u201cPaul Ramone\u201d.Alice in Chains was a bunch of guys who weren\u2019t named Alice. And none of them performed in chains.Jethro Tull was named after an 18th-century agriculturalist. Sadly that agriculturalist didn\u2019t live long enough to play in a rock band.Bathory was named after Elizabeth Bathory. But the band has no blood-bathing Hungarian countess in its lineup. Instead, it\u2019s mostly the work of Tomas B\u00f6rje Forsberg, AKA: \"Quorthon\",The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza had nothing to do with Tony Danza or tapdancing.",
