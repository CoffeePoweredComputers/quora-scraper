            "answer_text": "The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a given trading day; for example, the National Stock Exchange opens at precisely 9:15 a.m. The price of the first trade for any listed stock is its daily opening price. The calculation of prices is completely automated, software driven, and anonymous at both BSE and NSE, and the price is calculated by electronically matching bids and offers for a particular share recorded an electronic limit order book (ELOB). When you place an order to buy a share at a certain price that is called your \u201cbid\u201d and when you place an order to sell your shares at a certain price that\u2019s called your \u201cask\u201d. The ELOB contains all the bid \u2013 asks for a particular share and the system matches the best bids and asks to execute an order. The price at which a transaction is executed is called the last traded price (LTP) and that\u2019s what you see on TV screens. From the NSE\u2019s website \u2013 let\u2019s take a look at an example ELOB to understand this process. ",
