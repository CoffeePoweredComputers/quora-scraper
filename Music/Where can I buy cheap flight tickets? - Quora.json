            "answer_text": "I alway start with the travel aggregators. My favorite is SkyScanner at the moment, but have also had good luck with Kayak. From there, you can add your starting location and destination, and they will search a lot of the major airlines, as well as other OTAs (online travel agencies). Usually just doing that will get you 90% of the way to the cheapest price. On top of that, I would search for the budget airlines in the location that you\u2019re flying. Sometimes their prices and routes don\u2019t appear on the travel aggregators because they don\u2019t want to give up any commissions (which keeps their prices lower). Those budget airlines vary all around the world, so do some research about your location and then get to it. This might get you another 7% to the cheapest price. Finally, you can see if there are any price movement predictions. Kayak has a good tool that tells you the probability of the price rising or decreasing in the next 7 days. These price prediction services come and go because there\u2019s a lot of interesting data science going on in the background, which is valuable. If the probabilities work out in your favor, then you might be able to get to that extra 3%, on average. And don\u2019t forget about the tradeoffs: Are you really trying to get the cheapest price? If so, will you accept a flight with 4 layovers that takes 59 hours? Maybe not, but perhaps a single layover is acceptable, or maybe 2 because you\u2019ll have the perfect book to read all day long. Or do you really care about travel times? Would you be willing to fly from 1:30AM to 5AM to get the cheapest flight? Or would you prefer to fly during reasonable daylight hours? I\u2019ve seen all of these scenarios recently. I tend to look for the right combination of cheapness, direct-ness, and during reasonable hours. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not just a goal to find cheap flights, it's a goal to find cheaper travel, period. Sometimes people focus just on \u201cflights \u201c but in actuality flights is just 1/3 of travel costs. For instance I travel to southern California quite a bit. I travel for sporting events such as bowl games, March madness etc. Even though an event may be in Los Angeles, flights to LA that weekend may be extremely high if the event is big enough. So I fly into San Diego, spend the night, then take a train up to LA. Another example, did you know it's cheaper to fly into LAX and Uber to long Beach than it is to fly directly to long Beach Airport? Or leaving a day earlier can save you a ton? You'd need to understand all these things, before you go searching for that rock bottom fare. Website services like scott's cheap flights will give you a good starting point, but you still need to flesh out the best possible rates for your circumstances. Scotts is a service I live by. But in order to take advantage of Scots travel I need to First be willing to be flexible with my travel Arrangements. Also I need to understand how to use travel booking and fair research sites such as momondo and Google flights. Once Scotts Flags a flight that interest me, I go to Google Flights and search every possible combination within the range I gotta find. A good example would be a trip from Hawaii 2 Rome. Scotts identify the price up around $416 round trip which is about as good as it can get. Then I went 2 Google flights and spent about 45 minutes changing dates and departure airports and arrival airports and utilizing different websites before I settled in on two round trip coach tickets to Rome 4 $479 on dates that were perfect for me. I just looked and the same flight I'm taking in August are now going for $1,700. The point is getting the best possible fare usually starts with a tip and there's a ton of leg work that goes into into it after the fact. If you really wanted to get into the low price game, start by watching some videos on how to use Google flights and Scott's travel. That alone will get you thinking the right direction. ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a lot of different ways how to buy cheap flight tickets. One that is obvious is when you happen to land on an online booking website that has the cheapest offer for that specific flight. Since cheap flight tickets are really hard to find and flight prices vary from time to time, and due to the fact that there\u2019s a lot of factors to consider to be able to get one, the right question to answer is where to find websites or travel agencies that offer cheap flights. If you know the right strategy of finding those then searching for a cheap flight to buy for your next travel would be a lot easier. The key is to know where to find them before getting what they can offer. Now, you may think that Google is the best place to go to find those websites and travel agencies that offer real-cheap flight tickets regardless of destination. Although Google is the most powerful online search engine and it crawls fast, it cannot guarantee that it brings the right result. Google\u2019s number one factor to treat search queries is the relevance of the keyword being used by the searcher, and note that keyword could be abused or manipulated to generate traffic to a website but it does not mean that a website content brings the right information. For example, searching for cheap flights in Google would only lead you to websites like Momondo, Kayak, Skyscanner and other giants in the industry because they\u2019ve already positioned themselves long before in front of Google crawler and they\u2019ve already established a Google-friendly identity being online for many years. But whether or not they are really offering the cheap flights tickets, I\u2019m sure not at all. But when it comes to relevance, yes, their content matters and it is relevant to what the searcher searches but obviously not the solution to the burden carried by the searcher. In short, it does not help. This is actually the reason why many travelers are still searching for the right place to find a cheap flight ticket when scheduled to travel abroad. In fact, Google really does not care, and remember that Google is an engine or a robot that does the work based on the algorithm or program, not based on how a person feels. From the standpoint of someone who understands SEO, Google is not the answer. The thing is, there are some unique places online that really do the work of finding the cheapest flights tickets and low airfare providers. Some of them are unlucky when it comes to ranking on the first page of Google and Google might have not really seen them. But when it comes to the relevance of the search query when someone searches for cheap flights tickets, for example, those guys simply do what they said. So, where can someone really buy real cheap flight tickets? The answer is, by using a unique flight search engine that specializes in crawling the web, searching for cheap flight tickets available regardless of airline company and destination, you can really have the cheapest airfare no matter where you want to go. So, you may just click that link above to visit that flight search engine also known as budget airlines flight search engine, where finding the cheapest airfare online is their real business. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget about it.   There will ALWAYS be someone who has paid less than you.   You need to concentrate on value not price.   Is it worth $10 to take two flights instead of a non stop?   If you fly on an airline that offers 28\" pitch would you pay $20 to fly on one with 31\" pitch (I would but then I'm 6ft 2in).   Do you have to go to an airport that costs $10 more to get to just to save $5 on the fare? There are all sorts of theories about when to book.   People claim you need to do it on Tuesday, others say book months in advance while a different group will say wait until the last minute.    You're up against an airline revenue department.   These guys really know their market.   They price based on data you might never consider.   For instance, suppose you live somewhere with a large ethnic population.   You want to go to Washington DC.   There's nothing special on in Washington, it's late January who wants to go to Washington?   Ah, but your ethnic neighbours want to go home because there's a religious festival you've never heard of they want to attend.   The only flight to their home country goes from Washington.   If the revenue manager knows that will he try and sell tickets for higher amounts to people heading to the festival via Washington or a peanut fare to you just to get to Washington?   It's a real nighmare, festivals, public holidays, conventions, sports events, stadium concerts and who knows what else are fed into the revenue mix. There are a few guides.   Airlines apply seasons to some international routes so find out about the seasons and pick the cheaper season.  Midweek travel is usually cheaper - on the Atlantic, for example, Tuesday and Wednesday quite often have the lowest loads so they're trying to drum up business. ",

Kiwi.com | Find Cheap Flights & Discover New Destinations The Best Deals on Hotels, Flights and Rental Cars. All of the above search engines will find cheap flight options for you. However, bear in mind some airlines are not covered. For instance Southwest Airlines would not show up in the results. Skiplagged: The smart way to find cheap flights is also a unique search engine in that it gives you flight options that might have hidden cities (a particular method of finding cheap flights). United Airlines even tried to sue them as they produced unbelievably cheap flights but skiplagged won in the court case. Also, Human-Powered Flight Search is an online travel agent that you could go to where you can either present what you found (on for instance Skyscanner) and they will try to beat your price or you can just request them to find cheap flights to your destination for a price. In the first option, if they cannot beat your price (by the amount of the fee depending on the flight ticket type you are requesting them to beat your price), they will refund you all of the fee you paid at the start. And so therefore, you will be well off either way. In the second option, you inform them of the details of your flight request (route, date, class etc) and they will find a cheap flight ticket you can book. For this you pay a set amount of fee first.

            "answer_text": "I would re-command these tips for cheap flight tickets #Befriend budget airlines Budget airlines offer significantly cheaper tickets than their full-service counterparts. It should be obvious, but this comes with compromises such as less leg room and no \u201cfree\u201d food/drink on-board (which by the way, is normally covered in your higher-priced ticket with full-service airlines).Below is a comprehensive list of budget airlines around the globe. Red indicates true budget airlines while blue implies the cheapest companies available where budget airlines don\u2019t exist or aren\u2019t plentiful. But First\u2026 A NOTE ON BOOKING BUDGET AIRLINES. Always read the fine print and do the following: Check where the airport location is (some budget airlines fly to airports further out of town). Ensure you\u2019ve booked & paid for your luggage allowance. Adhere to restrictions on weight, height, and # of bags allowed. Some airlines (e.g. Ryanair) will charge hefty fee if you\u2019re over. Remember, paying only for the exact luggage space/weight you need is how budget airlines keep their prices lower than traditional airlines! Read the fine print. The best example is that Ryanair WILL CHARGE A FEE if you do not print your own ticket or adhere to their strict luggage weight and dimensions. A warning of this fee is clearly stated in all capital letters in the first sentence of your e-confirmation. In a nutshell, always read and follow instructions! Remember, if you want to book the cheapest flight possible (not service-of-the-year-award-winner), be adaptable, do your research, and know the budget airline\u2019s requirements & restrictions. Use Twitter, Facebook or regularly check budget airline web pages to keep you in touch with specials before they sell out. Air Asia, Jetstar, Tiger Air and Ryanair are especially good at having regular deals. #Book connecting flights yourself for less If you\u2019re flying somewhere that involves a transfer, say from Canada to Australia which typically involves Canada to LA, then LA to Australia, consider that it may be cheaper to book these two legs separately on your own by adding another destination to your trip. It should go without saying that in doing this, you should not book tight layovers. I repeat: do not book layovers that are hours apart! This approach is for those who want to create an additional destination of a few days or more, before catching their next flight. The one exception is when booking with Kiwi.com | Find Cheap Flights & Discover New Destinations, who offer their own guarantee on making connecting flights even when not with the same partner airlines. First, do your research: are there budget airlines unique to the country you\u2019re flying out of and where you\u2019re headed to? Booking with a budget Australian airline (Jetstar) from Sydney to Honolulu, then an American one from Honolulu to Montreal saved us over $400 each when flying back from Australia to Canada earlier this year. This allowed us to create a thrifty five-day stopover in Hawaii on our way back, which was less exhausting and a lot cheaper! Kiwi.com | Find Cheap Flights & Discover New Destinations and AirWander are both great search engine for revealing cheaper routes like this that involve multiple airlines. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not just a goal to find cheap flights, it's a goal to find cheaper travel, period. Sometimes people focus just on \u201cflights \u201c but in actuality flights is just 1/3 of travel costs. For instance I travel to southern California quite a bit. I travel for sporting events such as bowl games, March madness etc. Even though an event may be in Los Angeles, flights to LA that weekend may be extremely high if the event is big enough. So I fly into San Diego, spend the night, then take a train up to LA. Another example, did you know it's cheaper to fly into LAX and Uber to long Beach than it is to fly directly to long Beach Airport? Or leaving a day earlier can save you a ton? You'd need to understand all these things, before you go searching for that rock bottom fare. Website services like scott's cheap flights will give you a good starting point, but you still need to flesh out the best possible rates for your circumstances. Scotts is a service I live by. But in order to take advantage of Scots travel I need to First be willing to be flexible with my travel Arrangements. Also I need to understand how to use travel booking and fair research sites such as momondo and Google flights. Once Scotts Flags a flight that interest me, I go to Google Flights and search every possible combination within the range I gotta find. A good example would be a trip from Hawaii 2 Rome. Scotts identify the price up around $416 round trip which is about as good as it can get. Then I went 2 Google flights and spent about 45 minutes changing dates and departure airports and arrival airports and utilizing different websites before I settled in on two round trip coach tickets to Rome 4 $479 on dates that were perfect for me. I just looked and the same flight I'm taking in August are now going for $1,700. The point is getting the best possible fare usually starts with a tip and there's a ton of leg work that goes into into it after the fact. If you really wanted to get into the low price game, start by watching some videos on how to use Google flights and Scott's travel. That alone will get you thinking the right direction. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart ways to book cheap flight tickets. 1. Be flexible with travel dates You might have come across websites claiming that booking flight tickets on a Tuesday or travelling on a weekday would save you big bucks. But that\u2019s not always true. So, we suggest, you check out the prices for the entire month. This way, you will get a clear picture of days that are cheaper for your destination. Where do you check the month prices? Browse through Google Flights, Skyscanner or Hopper. Either try it on the website or the mobileapp. What you have to do is simply feed in your departure and arrival cities. First, check for one-way fare. Click depart, do not enter a date, instead select the whole month. Then, click - search flights and you\u2019ll get to know the date which offers the lowest fare. Now, follow the above steps for your return flight to get the cheapest fare. If you\u2019re booking on the mobile app, you can view the price chart and book accordingly.2. Go for local airlinesMost of the search engines do not show local airlines. This happens mostly in case of remote places or less popular routes. If you\u2019re flying to any such destination, we suggest, you search on Google for the local airlines. Then, visit the local airlines website and check for any offers or deals. This will definitely help you, book your flights at a lower fare.3. Use incognito when searching for flightsHave you noticed that, each time you search for your flights, the fare prices increase in your web browser? Well, that happens due to the cookies in your browser. The website increases the fare after repeated search, so that you book your flight, then and there. You begin to anticipate that prices will increase further. Hence, we advise - when you search for flights, do it in the incognito mode. Each time, open a new incognito window before you begin your search. This way, your previous searches won\u2019t be stored, and you won\u2019t see raised flight fares. Other alternatives include browsing from a different laptop/computer or clearing your cookies to get lower fares.4. If possible, make payment in a currency cheaper than the Indian rupeeMany travellers use this option to get cheaper fares. Most of the airlines ask you to make payment in the currency of the country you\u2019re travelling from. The next time, when you\u2019re booking your flight tickets, check if you can pay in any other currency which is cheaper than your own. A word of caution here - If you\u2019re making the payment through your credit card, your credit card shouldn\u2019t levy foreign-transaction fees. Then only, go ahead and book your tickets.5. Book your flights well in advance If your travel dates and destination both are fixed, we suggest - you book your flight tickets right away. The reason being - as your departure date approaches, the airline fares will only increase, exceptions are very few here. By booking your flight tickets well in advance, you can save big and utilise the savings for other enjoyable experiences.6. Set fare alerts When you visit airlines pages, do remember to set fare alerts. By doing this, you will get to know about the special offers, before they sell out and enable you to book cheap flight tickets. You can also follow pages of budget airlines like GoAir, Air Asia, Jetstar, Indigo and SpiceJet on Facebook and Twitter to learn about various deals and offers.7. Identify the cheapest place to travelIf you're itching to travel but don\u2019t have any specific destination in mind, then this trick is for you. You can use search engines to find out which places offer cheap flight fares, then accordingly freeze your holiday destination as per your interest. Thinking which website to visit? Well, you can try Skyscanner. Simply, enter your departure city and hit the search for cheap flights to anywhere in the world. Then, select the destination of your choice from the list of cheapest places to fly and book your tickets. This smart move will help you travel to exotic places and satiate the wanderlust in you.8. Make use of flight pointsIf you\u2019re a frequent flyer of a particular airline, you certainly earn air miles points as part of the loyalty program offered by the airline. For instance, Jet Airways offers JetPrivilege Miles wherein, depending on your miles, you can use them to get cheaper flight fares. You can make most of these points while travelling to domestic destinations. However, if you earn more points, you can also qualify for an award flight to your favourite destination.9. Compare and buy flight tickets Most of the travel search engines have inflated flight fares as part of taking a cut from the airlines. So, we suggest you try search engines like Google Flights, Skyscanner, JetRadar and Airfarewatchdog where you can get lower flight fares. What you have to do is try each one of them and compare the air fares for different airlines. Go ahead and book your flight tickets which offers the cheapest air fares.10. When booking connecting flights, do it yourselfMany a time, we have connecting flights and have to change from one plane to another on the way to our final destination. For such journeys, we suggest you visit the AirWander website. This search engine will offer you cheaper routes with multiple airlines options and save you more money.11. Book on the cheapest day If you\u2019re a night owl, then this trick is for you. If you aren\u2019t, then it\u2019s time to be one! You ask: Is it applicable thorough out the week? Unfortunately, no. According to research, if you book your flight tickets at midnight - Monday through Wednesday, you get cheaper air fares.",

            "answer_text": "Hey one of my Quora Friend recently spent a year traveling to 43 countries across 6 continents. I took over 60 flights during that period - and I almost never paid more than $200 per flight! How? Here are the exact steps I use when I search for airfare: 1. I clear my browser's cache because airline sites sometimes use it to track your purchases and charge you a higher rate!2. Then I go to to Google Flights. I've tried a LOT of different flight search programs and I've personally found that Google Flights has the best fares about 90% of the time.3. I then use the calendar feature to explore possible dates for cheaper fares.4. If I'm flexible on my destination, I click on the \"Explore Destinations\" feature, which opens up a map that will show you the prices for a ton of different destinations based on your selected dates and departure city.5. Google Flights will then send you to the actual booking site (it searches a bunch of them), where you can complete your purchase.6. Before actually booking though, I also quickly Google to see if there are any budget carriers that serve my destination. Some of them, like Southwest in the USA, only publish their fares on their own site.Remember that if your flight runs through the United States, in most circumstances you are entitled by law to a free 24 hour cancellation period (so if you see a cheap fare but need to confirm some other travel details first, you can snap it up and cancel later that day if it doesn't pan out).If you're an American, be sure to consider whether it make sense to try to earn free flights through credit card sign up bonuses.Hope this information was very helpful for you.

That money saved could be allocated to more important things and or more fun, I mean it is your Vacation for you to enjoy. That being said you definitely don\u2019t want to squander. My close friend\u2019s just came back from Disney and he said he regretted spending so much on airline expenses, transportation as well as hotel. He said that he wish he did more research and planning before instead of assuming that he would find a good deal when he got there. Every time I take my family down I make sure to plan it out. I find out the cheapest most cost effective as well as the best quality for the price or best bang for my buck. I look for a flight hotel as well as a car or family van, beforehand in order to A: ensure we have a great time and not spend our we\u2019ll deserved vacation time stressing over money that was wasted and not having a good time. B: not worry about Murphy\u2019s law because it WILL happen lol and C. SAVE MONEY!! This the best part. You will really enjoy your time if you know that you are not being scammed out of your money and your family will be happy because that money saved can be spent on them haha :) Yeah so saving on little things here and there can make a big difference at the end. The last time I traveled I used this site called Travelo ill link it below. It really took care of everything for me and made it easy. My friend put me on to this website, and for some reason he told me to keep it a secret. I think he thinks he will be missing out on the deals if more people knew about it lol. ",

            "answer_text": "I. Budget first approach Use websites which calculate the total trip price (Transportation + Accommodation) like Trip Composer. It will allow you to know the exact budget in a minute like on this acreen shot: Create various itineraries and optimize the number of nights, cities and the order of visiting.According to our research in European travel you need to use open-jawvapproach. It will be cheaper in multi-city travel.The example: you fly from NY to Rome,Then travel across Italy to northFly back from Milan to NYWhen you come up with the best itinerary, reduce your flight ticket price with some travel hacks. For example use my article How to Use VPN to Save Over 10% on Flight Tickets .II. Destination first approach 1. Travel in an optimal time frame \u2013 on the border of the low and high seasons Each destination has its high and low seasons. Also there are major holidays like Easter or events like a European Football Championship, which may increase flight prices significantly. If you\u2019re flexible on the dates, then do the following research: Use a metasearch website such as Skyscanner with a nice low fare calendar and long term statistics on flight prices. You can find the lowest priced month to travel and compare it with the high season. For example, in Italy it is January:  Compare the average prices with high season. Usually, at the beginning of the high season (for Italy, it\u2019s the end of March/ beginning of April) the weather can be fine but the prices are much lower. The same goes for the end of the high season. 2. Do not rely too much on well-known global websites There\u2019s huge competition in air travel search, so obviously there are a lot of websites you haven\u2019t even heard about. However, it is obvious that no global provider can do as good of a job as a talented local provider, especially when we\u2019re talking about the hot deals or special offers monitoring. I would list the following features as total must haves for the modern meta search engine: Ability to search flights using nearby airports options. For example, you can set the radius of the departure/arrival airport as 250km.Ability to set several departure/arrival cities.Multi-City itinerary search.Cheap fare calendar with accurate prices for your country/region. The international service may just have a lack of inquiries on the destinations for your countryNice to have a dedicated page with a list of special offers, discounts and limited dealsA nice example for European travel is Kiwi.com | Find Cheap Flights & Discover New Destinations:  3. Ensure that you have the optimal time and device for search Airlines websites use dynamic pricing, which means that different users will see different prices. To get the best price do the following: Use a PC laptop or an Android mobile/pad deviceSearch on the lowest priced day of the week \u2013 for the US it\u2019s Tuesday at 3 pm Eastern TimeChoose a flight on the low price days of the week \u2013 for the US it\u2019s Tue, Wed, SatIf you\u2019ve noticed that the price you were searching for just changed after you\u2019ve checked it 4-5 times, continue searching from another device (e.g. from your Android pad or phone).Alternatively clear your browser cookies and use incognito mode on your browser to get the maximum fair prices4. Use a VPN to get a 10% discount and more on airline tickets To demonstrate the power of the VPN, I used the popular European lowcoster WizzAir. The first search was made under Kyiv, Ukraine IP address (my current location):  The same flight but under Indian an IP address via the VPN (Price drop by -15%):  Read How to Use VPN to Save Over 10% on Flight Tickets to get the full information \u2026 More travel hacks in my article The-ultimate-guide-on-getting-the-cheapest-airline-tickets .

            "answer_text": "The first thing you want to do is actually find the cheap flights. There are websites, such as Skyscanner and Google Flights, where you can set up alerts when prices drop for a certain destination. Another great way to avoid constantly checking online is to subscribe to flight notification services. I run a site that sends out alerts for cheap flights out of Texas almost daily. Like mine, some are 100% free, however, the majority will require some form of payment to get notified ASAP (typically an annual fee). Keep in mind that you don\u2019t always HAVE to fly straight to your intended destination. EX: If you\u2019re wanting to head to Munich, but the flights are $2000 roundtrip, but you see a great deal to Prague for $400 roundtrip, then take that flight instead. Once you\u2019re actually in Europe, you can catch a train for less than $50 to Munich, and many other places.Try to be open to the idea of driving to an airport in a neighboring city for a great deal. I live in Texas, and most deals, when they do pop up, are out of Houston and Dallas, neither of which I live in. Something I always tell my followers is that cheap flights don\u2019t wait for you, so jump on those opportunities as they come your way. Finally, see what credit cards offer great points programs. The Points Guy is a great resource to compare all the different credit cards with points programs that are available. My personal preference is the Chase Sapphire line because the Ultimate Rewards program is incredible for frequent travelers. ",

I wish I could save as my friends do. I started exploring N number of websites and strategize an appropriate way to save more on flight tickets.

It helps you in finding raw deals and you can enjoy the benefits given by websites to their new users.Some flight search engines like Google Flights, Crystal Travel (UK) display the best fares for most of the time.Use calendar feature of Google Flights, Skyscanner or \u2018Flexi Dates\u2019 option available at Crystal Travel\u2019s website to explore more and find least possible airfare available near your date band. Flexi Dates\u2019 options or calendar feature displays airfare of various ranges.Always use coupon codes, you can subscribe newsletters of various airlines. Usually, flight search engines or airline services provide great flight deals in their newsletters.If you are flying to any popular destination, search for nearby airports which are less popular and accessible from your destination.Connecting flights are cheaper than direct flights.Always find shoulder season for your trip where you can save more on flights and accommodation.

            "answer_text": "I would recommend the following strategy\u2026. 1. compare between websites such as Expedia, Travelocity but also with local companies which have most of their business in your area (Western Europe, Eastern USA, Western USA\u2026 there are companies that focus on their specific regions and do a lot of business there\u2026 ), I would also check with the airline online as most give the best price on their own website. Sign up with a number of airline frequent flyer programmes, even if you only fly once or twice a year\u2026 the airlines look after their own and will send specials throughout the year which can be very affordable. Some airlines get underrated\u2026 I find Turkish Airlines a solid middle of the road airline with comfort, good entertainment, acceptable food and the right pricing. If I was to fly other European airlines, I would have to shop around\u2026 An example: Lufthansa fantastic reliability, new planes, reasonable entertainment\u2026. however generally more expensive than other airlines, average to poor quality food, limited choice of drinks but in all fairness they have superb flight attendants who are highly experienced in their job. BA is also reliable and maintains its standards, however beware if you sit next to a drunken lout on a full plane\u2026. their handling of that particular experience has left a major impression on me regarding the airline. In conclusion shop around, check out the airline and their reputation and pricing. Remember prices fluctuate depending on the time of year! If you want to fly out of Europe during July and August prices can increase dramatically. If you can leave a little earlier or later, prices will drop\u2026. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Traveling all around the world seems like a lot of fun. Be it flying to an international route or domestic destination, finding the air tickets at lowest rates is one of the tricky task. Expensive flight tickets tend to put a hole in our pockets, thus, if you\u2019re looking for economic and budget-friendly travel, then use flight booking coupons to lower down your expenses. Apart from this, there are several ways which can make you get air tickets at lowest prices. For your convenience, I have mentioned some tricks to get flight tickets at lesser rates in further section, keep on reading. While traveling solo might be a tad bit economical but the vacation with family can take a toll on your bank account. Thus, finding air tickets at lowest rates can sort that concern. There is no dearth of discount and deals on online flight booking sites, you can refer to those websites before bookings. Adding on, if possible try to avoid weekends and festive dates for traveling. Because on these days there is so much rush and rates are also on high because of tickets scarcity. Another trick for getting air tickets at reasonable rates is to try to book tickets in advance at least two or three months before the traveling date. Booking tickets in advance can make you catch deals and discount on your tickets. But sometimes, last minute bookings can also help you to save more with \u201clast minute deals on the flight\u201d. This fortune happens seldom so, try to book in advance. One more advice is- book non-refundable tickets because of non-refundable costs less than refundable tickets. The thumb rule of booking flight is the compare and compare. Before the final decisions check out all the online travel portals. Because there are huge chances that the prices will differ from one to another. Otherwise, you can also look out for different routes to your destination. There are possible chances that you can get cheap tickets for any other alternative routes. You can also subscribe for email alerts for getting notifications regarding various offers and deals. However, at times, these email alerts do turn out to be beneficial. From news of flash sales to new routes with a special discount, and last minute low flight fares, you get instant alerts about such deals. So, by putting a simple effort you can get your air tickets for your preferred destination at very affordable rates. ",

            "answer_text": "WestJet is currently the second-largest Canadian air carrier, behind Air Canada. It began as a low-cost alternative to the country\u2019s competing major airlines. What people are quickly realizing is that Canada\u2019s second largest airline. WestJet has one of the best rewards programs of any airline. In this WestJet Rewards review, I\u2019ll break down everything you need to know about the program and it right for you and maximizing your benefits from the program. WestJet Rewards program is a cash-back program. Let\u2019s get that straight. Cash back programs is something I always love, you don\u2019t end up with stupid points and converting them while redeeming to cash value. You have to note this point though as a WestJet members you\u2019ll get rewarded in WestJet dollars which can be then spent on various WestJet services with no blackout dates. Meaning, there will be no seat restrictions, and no advance bookings required. Redemptions start at just $15 WestJet dollars. Isn\u2019 that great! How to earn WestJet dollars \u2013 WestJet Rewards Review As a WestJet traveller you spend money on the WestJet flights, WestJet vacation packages, or cars and hotels booked on Book flights and vacation packages. The amount you spend will earn between .5% \u2013 5% cash-back in WestJet dollars depending on the tier. This may sound complicated, but it\u2019s pretty straightforward since everything is tied to tiers. Tiers are structured around how much you spend in a 12-month qualifying period. The more you spend, the higher your tier status becomes. The higher your status is, the better your rewards are. Teal status earns you 1% in WestJet dollars up to $2,999 in spendSilver status earns you 3% in WestJet dollars from $3,000 \u2013 $4,999 in spendGold status earns you 5% in WestJet dollars from $5,000 \u2013 $7,999 in spendPlatinum status earns you 8% in WestJet dollars and kicks in one you spend $8,000One of the major improvements to the WestJet Rewards program is that you now maintain your status for the following year. You do need to maintain the qualifying flight spend in each successive year, but you no longer reset to teal like before. Recently in the month of December 2018, Platinum tier status was added to the WestJet rewards program. One other thing to note here is that the spend threshold to reach Gold was reduced; which is good for people who spend a lot on WestJet flights. WestJet Rewards Tier Information and Flight Benefits screenshots below \u2013 More Information can be found here \u2013 Tiers | WestJet Add-On benefits with WestJet Rewards With the expansion of WestJet Rewards reciprocal frequent flyer agreements, you can now book flights from Air France, Delta Airways, KLM and Qantas Airlines and earn reward dollars as cash-back.

            "answer_text": "Somebody of you may know that Tuesday is the magical day to book flight tickets, but there are some hacks that depend on timing, travel itinerary and the tools you use to book tickets. The following points explains below. TimingBook your flight at the right time: 47 days out is considered the best time to buy for any domestic flight, while international travel varies by destination and should be purchased further in advance of your preferred departure date.Don\u2019t book too early: So you know when and where you\u2019re going\u2014but don\u2019t get over-exited! The average domestic fare found six months before a desired departure date was found to be 19% higher as compared to fares searched for a month in advance.ItineraryGo multi-city: Once upon a time, a round-trip ticket into and out of the same city was the cheapest.Go one-way: Two one-way tickets may in fact be cheaper than a full round-trip ticket, so don\u2019t forget to check just to see. The work will be only booking two tickets.Check one-person flights first: Even if you\u2019re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines would hike up prices when you\u2019re buying many seats.ToolsVary your search: Check the individual websites of the airlines you are interested in, sometimes direct airline websites will have the best deals.Use the right tools: There are various tools available to book cheap tickets for flights but choosing them wisely will save you some money. There are tools with predictive features built in. You can compare prices for different trips and dates, and can also set alerts for particular routes and dates.Trade your points: Points Loyalty Wallet allows you to exchange, buy, and sell points from various loyalty programs. Trading or buying a few extra miles might be all you need to earn a travel reward.See it all in one place: There are tools like ITA Flight Matrix that collect flight information from every service provider and also allows you to sort results by location, cost per mile, date ranges, and more, and lets you reset your sales city to see the potential for altering your point of sale.Source: Hacks for Finding Cheap Flights Cheers, Clarke ",

Look here for safety ratings Airline & Safety Ratings - Airline RatingsIf you want to check a bag make sure that it is included in the fare. Some low cost airlines really sting you there. Add that to the ticket cost.Meals on board. 25 euros for a tray meal is not unusual. Sure, you can take sandwiches but after ten hours or so they will be looking a bit sad. Not a problem for a short flight.You might want a drink. Will it be included in the fare? No? That's another addition.Seat selection. Most cheap rates don't allow you to choose your seat in advance unless you pay extra. Anywhere around 25 euros per leg. So, on a return flight with one change of aircraft each way that's 100 euros more per passenger. That's an ordinary seat, not wider or more legroom. You might get lucky anyway when you check in, but don't hold your breath.While we are talking comfort, take a look at the seat layout, especially the seat pitch. This site will show most aircraft configurations. Airline Seat Maps, Flights shopping and Flight information- Best Airplane SeatsHow many changes? How much time to spend in an airport where you will inevitably end up spending money? Or a very short connection, rushing around getting to the gate. Ok, if it is a same airline same ticket connection they should make sure you don't miss your onward flight, but it is still a pita.Dispatch reliability. Look at where you need to change flights. Make sure it's the same airport, as a minimum. Preferably the same terminal. Some airports are very large, and you may need to catch a bus or even a train between terminals. Good luck with that if you are travelling with children.Geography matters too, as weather can cause delays. Moscow in December? Hmmm.Catch that flight at 03:00? Unless you are really close to the airport or have some very good friends then factor in the cost of a hotel or some airport parking, as there won't be much public transport around. Same goes for an arrival at stupid o'clock.Good luck and enjoy your holiday! ",

(doesnt cost them anything , and theyd prefer a company to keep using the airline ) I think thats an old one though .

            "answer_text": "Hi, Being a Travel Junkie, I suggest you following mechanism to get cheapest Air Ticket - Though success rate is mere at 40%. Thumb Rule is you plan your journey in Advance - As Airlines Fares changes as per algorithm with respect to availability of tickets i.e. If a flight has 180 Seats & 175 Ticket already sold out in a week time, then Fare charges will shoot up. The mechanism is very complex, thus best to book ticket in advance atleast 45\u201360 days (While booking never book non flexi tickets i.e. those tickets in which changes can not be made & you will lose all your ticket fare, since In 2 months changes in your plan or travel may happen)Use Meta Search Enginer - Skyscanner, Kayak & Wego - They provide rate comparison from different website for bookingSome of the best Websites for Ticket booking are : http://www.flyrrr.com - I booked from this website, I saved few bucks $5 per ticket, though the web does not provide Least rates as Leas is provided by HappyEasyGo - their problem is they will give your money back if you made changes in ticket or cancel it. Happyeasygo is very harsh on it, difference between HappyEasygo rates and Flyyrr rate is in between $1 or $2 per ticket, thus i choose flyyrr, the company is more trustworthy and transparent.",

Anyway, my two personal favorite sites are Secret Flying and Flight Deal. If you have a set agenda the ITA matrix, Google flights, and Momondo are very good. Some people like Scott's cheap flights, I do not. If you want to fly on points contact me again. The best times to fly are the shoulder seasons, spring and fall. The prices are lower, accommodations are cheaper, and the crowds are much thinner. Plus the summer heat sucks, I far prefer more temperate seasons. The times to avoid are mid summer, and all major holiday seasons. If you must travel during those times, arrange it far in advance for the best prices. ",

Few \u2018cheap ticket/destination finder\u2019 website have calendar search for the whole year, but I would advise you to start planning your holiday by visiting one of these sites at least 6 weeks before the desired departure date as reservation sites offer the lowest price in this period of time. As the date is getting closer or the popularity of the route is increasing airlines tend to raise the price so they can reach maximum profit. My favorite one is TravelFor.Me | Search and Compare Flight, Hotel, Car Rental, Activity Prices which is an easy-to-use website. Their search forms and blog helps you find the best destinations with as low price as possible. Here is what you can do:A) Just choose your destination airport and click \u2018Search\u2019. B) Scroll down and browse the calendar to choose the lowest costs or you favorite airline. THEN: You will be redirected to the oofficial website so you can add extra services or additional luggage. All in all, The Travel Planner is the one that has always helped me to plan my holidays (I've booked my previous travels/holidays on their site because they also offer hotel and car-rental search). and to search and compare ticket prices of airlines.

You might save some money, but there is a good chance that you will have to compromise your time/energy/your plan etc. Your time worth a lot more and the plan being ruined by unexpected delays/cancellation won't be fun at all.

However, if something happens to your flight (i.e.: cancellation, delay) some airlines won't touch your ticket to rebook because it wasn't booked with them directly.  So what I do is go to one of those travel websites and search for flights - have them do all the leg work. From the results I identify the flight I want to take, then I go to the airlines website and book it. Often, you can find the very same flight at the very same price.  ",

With the different websites on the roll, it has been quite confusing for the person who is booking a flight ticket.

When I have to answer, my personal preference has always been the merchant or the seller site without involving any third party. Booking directly through the service provider\u2019s website will provide you with a number of benefits. To enlist, the following are few of them\u2014 You would come to know directly about the existing offers on special dates or eventsYou would always be knowing the company\u2019s policy and the steps taken to improve the customer serviceYou would be well aware of the launch of new services and promotional eventsThere are at times when the service provider gives special benefits on booking through their websiteYou will be entitled to the company\u2019s newsletter and other subscription and would be notified whenever such things happenMy personal piece of advice to the people looking for tickets has always been to book air tickets on the carrier\u2019s site directly.

IN any case, I always go to such places as Kayak which yes prices from up to five companies that look for bargain flights. You can request flights from lowest to highest cost or vice versa. Once I identify a good deal, I then go to the airline site to see if I can get anything better there. Once I have my deal, I book it, making sure that I can cancel within 24 hours (you can nearly always do this when booking from the airline or sites like Travelocity etc. Definitely check for better deals the ext day. If you find one, cancel the first ticket and rebook. If it is a pricey long-haul flight, insurance is well worth the price just in case you will need to cancel later. Happy travels ",
