            "answer_text": "Because Summer Sixteen wasn't successful enough.  The way that Drake makes his albums is he basically invest into it like he's telling a story. All the songs are connected and pre-planned as going towards the final idea he's trying to get across and the only other way to get on the actual album is for the song to be incredibly successful like Hotline Bling was.  Otherwise you wouldn't be able to differentiate it from the other 14-16 to non-mixtape songs he dropped since Nothing Was The Same.  ",
