            "answer_text": "To answer your question. The best free DAW for Windows PC's in my opinIon is, ironically, Linux Music and Multimedia Studio or LMMS. It's a free (I believe open source) DAW that originated on Linux and was then ported to Windows and Apple later. It has ALL of the features of the big name DAW packages except it's totally free. You can use the same plugins, the same MIDI hardware, import and export audio in the same formats, it's got an intuitive workflow, and it's got the same basic learning curve. Why more people don't use it is beyond me. I use Sonar but that's really only because I learned it and have followed it through it's versions and improvements and don't want to now fully learn all of the intricacies of another one during which time my productivity will be dismal...but if I was starting out again right now, I'd definitely give it a go!

            "answer_text": "A2A There is no best DAW for Windows, but I won't be one of those people. This list seems to sum it up: http://routenote.com/blog/the-10-best-free-daws-available/ Very good list of stuff. In my humble opinion, LMMS is trash unless you're making video game trance music. Puu puuu puuuuuu! Pow pow. Arpegiators! Lol. Audacity is good if you're doing recording based work, (I.e. Editing audio files). I personally own and use REAPER, (and many other softwares) and although it's on the list, it's not actually free. I believe it's free for 60 days, then you have to pay 60 bucks for small business use. Another thing to watch out for is REAPER comes with no sounds. At all. So be ready to invest in some good VSTs if you want to make any music. Hope this helped! ",
