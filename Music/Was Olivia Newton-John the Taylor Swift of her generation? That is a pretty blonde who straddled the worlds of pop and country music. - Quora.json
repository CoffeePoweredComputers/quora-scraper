            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Like many other\u2019s have posted, things get rather dodgy when comparing people and their accomplishments from different eras. Being attractive female singers is about the only attribute they share. One of the main differences was that Olivia Newton-John came of age when recorded music was the prime enterprise. Selling vinyl records (or tapes) was the main revenue generator. Music videos were still several years off. If you wanted your own copy without paying for it, you could borrow it from someone and record it to tape but there would be some degrading of the recording - no digital file sharing. Also, they were prone to get damaged or worn out and you had to buy a replacement. Concert appearances were just an add-on, usually coinciding with the release of an album. With the advent of on-line music and file sharing, most of Taylor Swift\u2019s income is from concerts and not music sales. Olivia Newton-John arrived just as television was starting to become an important component to promoting any music act. She, like Taylor swift, was beautiful, photogenic and telegenic. Weekend television had big music shows broadcast late at night - Midnight Special, Don Kirschner\u2019s Rock Concert, In Concert, etc. With only three networks, these had a wide audience, particularly with the high school and young adult population, but they were at the whim of the producers. Taylor Swift has YouTube and can produce her own material. As with any visual medium, beauty (particularly in female singers) began to take on even greater importance. In fact physical beauty is now important than voice. Think Carole King, Janis Joplin, or Cass Elliot would have made it today? Olivia Newton-John did not write her own music or play an instrument. However, she did not have the benefit of Auto tune. You can criticize its content but Taylor Swift does write a lot of her own music but her appeal is singing, not playing an instrument. In ONJ\u2019s day, music was not so homogenized so it was easy to have a distinctive voice and style - the industry was more accepting of risk. So much of today\u2019s music by female singers, Taylor Swift\u2019s included, sounds very similar to one another (at least to me). The perceived or real stakes of a failure seem much higher these days so everyone in the industry plays it safe. Also Olivia Newton-John had a film career. Not great movies but have over time become cult classics - Xanadu and Grease. Taylor Swift\u2019s appearance in Cats doesn\u2019t seemed to have helped her career but it could become a cult classic, too, in a few years. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes there are similarities but comparing the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s to the 2000\u2019s is apples to oranges. Seems like most of the responses are a little bias toward Taylor. Well, if you are under 40, that\u2019s understandable. Another way to frame this is whether Taylor would have made it in the 70s. I say probably not. Singers of the 70s had to have strong enough voices to sing loud without over production on stage or in the studio with auto tunes. Olivia was a huge powerhouse back then. Instead of social media there were tv specials. She had no less than 5 prime time tv specials including one for her physical video album concept that was a top 10 ratings hit. She remains the number 20 biggest singles artist of all time according to billboard and The record company rso that released the Grease soundtrack stopped submitting riaa certification requests in the 1990s. Including soundscan sales Grease is estimated to have sold closer to 30 million albums worldwide. She had huge success in the USA, Canada, Japan, U.K., Australia and some South American countries like Chile. So now the question, to be fair, whether Olivia would have bern a success starting out in the 2000s. The answer is a resounding NO. Olivia never speaks ill of others or trashes other artists. I\u2019ve met her a few times. She has a genuine spirit and is heavily engaged in philanthropic activities with fundraising walks and performing for her fans in Vegas even when in immense pain so she wouldn\u2019t cancel and disappoint fans. She has never compromised integrity in her career. I\u2019m disheartened by all the social media bashing today most music artists engage in as another means to relevancy. Olivia has had a great and rewarding career simply being true to herself and her fans. I would take that anyday over 50 million more sales. and let\u2019s not forget she was the biggest female singles artist of the 70s. And physical is ranked the number 1 single of the 80s. If it weren\u2019t for Olivia Newton John there would have not been your the one that I want. Or hopelessly devoted to you in Grease. Her songwriter wrote those songs. Olivia has always been underrated as one of the original pop princesses. You have to have been around in the 70s and 80s to understand it. ",
