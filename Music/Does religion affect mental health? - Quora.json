            "answer_text": "I think that the correlation may have to do with the support system that belonging in a church can provide. Also some religions offers hope and can help with struggles in mental illness. Religion may be an important part in a believer's treatment plan, but it is not a magical cure for mental illness. It is part of a treatment plan made with a client which may include therapy and medications. I would like to let people know that expecting a person to be to \u201cpull themselves up\u201d to \u201cfixed\u201d purely by church or religion when the person is mentally ill does not believe so can make that person feel badly. They must agree on the treatment plan too. ",

And a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of hypertension, depression, and clinical delinquency.  A meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better self-actualization.  Finally, a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that \"the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, drug/alcohol use/abuse.\" Source: Happiness  ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to say, honestly. The correlation between religion and mental health varies significantly by religion, as well as by region and culture. There are enough factors that go into mental health statistics that it\u2019s frequently hard to pick out what effect religion has. For example, traditionally, being highly religious has meant being part of an organized, robust and involved community, leading to more social activity, public engagement, and both practical and personal support, which are all things that correlate highly with good mental health. On the other hand, if someone is so religiously extreme that they cut off contact with most people around them (for fear of being corrupted) and become isolated, that\u2019s bad for mental health. Note that all of this is true long before you take any consideration of the personal and spiritual implications of belief, or your adherence to the principles of any religion, let alone any question of whether or not the religion is true. Reality is, humans are complex, mental health is complex, and figuring out what factors impact it is actually a really tough statistical puzzle, most of the time. ",

People moderately addicted/devoted to religious dogmas are better off than the non-believers, by and large.This is because they take refuge in the religious halo for much of their anxieties and fears.On the negative side excessive/wrong religious indoctrination can cause deleterious mental health. For example a person inclined to a religious order may ignores his day to day duties. Another example unacceptable religious constitution can be seen in the human suicide bombers/death squads of 'terrorists' so common in the world scenario these days.\"Religion is the opium of the masses\".",

            "answer_text": "Is religion detrimental to mental health? Seems unlikely. Born-again, committed Christians, who worship regularly, enjoy better mental health than average, including less depression, stress and suicidal thoughts. They also enjoy happier and longer-lasting marriages and even better sex than average! This is not surprising. The Christian gospel includes: - forgiveness of sin - letting go of resentments and unhealthy ambitions - a sense of purpose - valuing things that are more important than money and status - developing beneficial traits such as kindness and compassion - building community (both in church and outward social efforts) All of these things benefit mental health. The flip side is that atheism can increase depression, as one believes that there is no purpose to life and that everything is meaningless, whilst cultivating tendencies that lead to increased alienation and isolation (support for divorce, reduced community spirit, lower barriers to infidelity, etc.).

To simplify some of life's questions with the presence of a deity or parental archetype that knows and sees all, may help a person who lives in a chaotic place mentally find something to grip onto. Almost like AA can help some addicts find a group to relate to and find peers that have shared experiences, to assist them as they attempt to fight urges. Do I think that religion actually does help cure mental disorders? No. I think indoctrination into religion creates its own mental disorders and those who are imbalanced who join aren't being cured, they are joining more unbalanced people and feel at home. ",

Not all of these I am sure we're done by those who truly believed their actions were just, many I am sure we're pressured or given no choice, but it happened none the less. Religion it self is not the problem, humans are not machines though, they all think, feel, and act differently for different reasons, so following any path no matter how well intended will differ from one person to the other.
