            "answer_text": "My favorites albums are: Grimes - Art Angels (2015) This album is the reason why I started listening to music seriosuly, especially indie. It is so intense and different, the use of loud guitars and the strange lyrics can be surprisingly enjoyable;  Radiohead - In rainbows (2007) It is a recent discovery. The band covers different genres and intensities, without losing consistency. My favorite track is \u201cAll I Need\u201d;  Beach Boys - Pet Sounds (1966) I describe this as the best album in history. This masterpiece (with a terrible cover) is truly immersible and a complete experience. Some tracks have harps or even bicycle bells. \u201cI could try to be big in the eyes of the world; What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl\u201d - That\u2019s not me.  ",
