If it\u2019s an emergency, like you found his wallet, you\u2019ll find a way. If you need Dre call Eminem. But seriously if a Dire emergency of yours or his, contact Shady Records/Aftermath Records and explain the severity of reason and if it is seriously an issue someone will make sure it gets to him by chain of command. Good night. ",
