            "answer_text": "Most of Taylor\u2019s 1989 album is about him, scratch that pretty much all of 1989 is about him. Style-This song is obviously about him. She talks about their rocky relationship and how when it kept failing she knew it wasn\u2019t the complete end, that there were still feelings there. She also describes him in a few lyrics; \u201c\u201cyou got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\u201d if that doesn\u2019t describe Harry what does, \u201cyou\u2019ve got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt\u201d, Harry has long, slick hair and how many times has he worn a white t-shirt in the past. There\u2019s also the name correlation. out of the woods-this song was inspired by a snowmobile accident they got into in Utah. She also tried to make the song portray the anxiety she had throughout the relationship and how the media was trying to tear them apart. The infamous lyric \u201ctwo paper airplanes flying\u201d is a reference to the paper airplane necklaces they both wore. All you had to do was stay-in an interview she said this song was inspired by a dream where her ex came to the door asking for a second chance and all she could say was stay. I\u2019m not certain this song is about him but it most likely is considering they broke up multiple times in their relationship. I wish you would-this song is about how after the relationship they stayed friends until he bought a house in LA two blocks away from her house. He also admitted that he drove by her house every night and wanted to come in and see her but never did. This is shown in the lyrics when she talks about the headlights showing in her room and thinking about him. wildest dreams-while being interviewed she said this song was about how she would go into a relationship hoping it\u2019d work out, but if it didn\u2019t she hoped that person would think of her well. Harry has mirrored these lyrics in his songs \u2018Olivia \u2018 and \u2018walking in the wind\u2019 how you get the girl-Taylor said this one is about a guy who broke up with her and wanted to date around but then realized what they had and went back, but he was 6 months too late. Harry was seen kissing models in early 2012 when they were supposedly secretly dating (I\u2019ll explain later) so he was cheating on her but then went back. Taylor explained how in this song the guy must do all those things to win her over. This love-this song was the first one she wrote on the album. She mentioned that it\u2019s about when you care about the person enough in the relationship to let them go, if the timing is right they\u2019ll come back. clean-Taylor said that she wrote this song when she was in London a while after her relationship with someone (Harry) has ended and realized she had been in the same city as him. Harry lived in London and still does. The song as a whole is about finally getting clarity. I know places-Harry and Taylor went on a famous date in Central Park where she was photographed wearing a Fox sweater. In this one she sings \u201cthey are the hunters we are the foxes\u201d which is also a reference to the media who was trying to rip them apart which caused them to hide. She also mentions his green eyes. Wonderland-in this one she mentions his green eyes again and his treacherous cat\u2019s smile. The song is about how they connected and went down a dating path that was exciting yet anxiety filled because of the public. In her album red her song I knew you were trouble is also about him. I originally thought it was about John Mayer until she was told she had a lot of energy performing it at one award show and she responded by saying it\u2019s easy when the person it\u2019s about is in the front row watching. Harry was there in the front row, John was not. This hints that they dated for longer than people thought until they were caught. ",

            "answer_text": " The three most clear songs that are about Harry Styles are I knew you were trouble (IKYWT), Style and Out of the woods. We know that IKYWT is about Harry because when she was accepting the VMA for best female video for IKYWT she publicly thanked him for being there and being the inspiration behind the song.  Style is pretty obvious, the song is called Sytle he is called Harry Styles, also the lyrics \u201ctwo papers airplanes flying\u201d is said to be a reference to the paper airplane necklace that Harry Syles freaquently wore and Taylor Swift wore once while they were dating. and Out of the Woods with the lyrics \u201cwe were built to fall apart, and fall back together\u201d, are said to reference their on and off relationship, while the lyrics \u201cremember when you hit the brakes too soon\u201d are about a snowmobile they had while they went on holiday in Utah together.
