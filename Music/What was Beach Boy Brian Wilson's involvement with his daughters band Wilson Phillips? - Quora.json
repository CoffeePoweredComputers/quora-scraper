            "answer_text": "None. They made it more or less on their own, having been blessed with musical parents and talent, especially as singers. Brian did not have much clout in the industry in the late 80s anyway. A book written by Gary Usher (The Wilson Project) regarding his brief collaboration with Brian in the late 80s, indicates that Marilyn Wilson (Brian\u2019s ex-wife and the mother of the girls) categorically did NOT want Brian (or his controller Eugene Landy, whose clutches he was deep within at the time and who was crazier than Wilson) involved in his daughters' career. And she was very strong in asserting that, using words on the phone to Usher that I will not rewrite here. Later, there was a sort of soft pop album that Carnie and Wendy did (i.e., without \u201cPhillips\u201d) in the mid nineties called The Wilsons. Brian sang/arranged harmonies on four songs on that and co-wrote two of them. One of them, \u201cEverything I Need\u201d was co-written by Brian and Tony Asher, the main lyricist for Pet Sounds and it is one of Brian\u2019s best love songs, actually. He produced the basic track with old members of the Wrecking Crew in true Pet Sounds style, but unfortunately producer Joe Thomas re-produced it for The Wilsons record giving it a sort of slick adult contemporary sheen, all \u201ctasteful\" nylon stringed acoustic guitar and big wet echoey woodblocks and drums and generally drowning everything in an ocean of trebly reverb. Brian\u2019s version was never released, much to the chagrin of the Wrecking Crew members and himself, but a rough mix is on youtube:  Brian later wrote this in his memoirs, I Am Brian Wilson: \". I remember cutting the track for it and how comfortable it felt. Hal Blaine was there, drumming. Carol Kaye was there, playing bass. Tony Asher was there. I scored a cool vibe those few days in the studio, a real sense of the old days. When it came time a few years later for the song to go on an album\u2014one by my daughters Carnie and Wendy, who were recording as the Wilsons\u2014things changed. I was going to record and produce the album with them, using some of the new songs I had written with Tony. But the girls were young. They wanted a vibe and a feel that I couldn't deliver. I got the idea I should just wish them good luck and bow out. And when I bowed out, things changed. Things changed with the song I had written. There was a day when they were overdubbing strings. When I got there, the string players were already cutting. They weren't using my arrangement. I had a twinge, remembering how it felt to have my music taken away from me. \"I don't want it to happen again,\" I said. I wasn't sure who was listening. I put my foot down, but I was unsteady on it.\" And this little story, by the way, pretty much characterizes at least half of Brian Wilson\u2019s solo career. ",
