            "answer_text": "Co-ed schools are actually far more better than single sex schools because a child gets more opportunities to interact with the opposite sex which helps a child to develop and be more comfortable with the opposite sex. Children from single sex schools don't get much opportunities to interact with the opposite sex which makes them shy and uncomfortable in working with the opposite sex in a work environment. ",
