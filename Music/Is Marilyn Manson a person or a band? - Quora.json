Every band member had a pseudonym composed by the first name of a super model and the second name of a serial killer: Twiggy Ramirez (bass), Madonna Wayne-Gacy (keyboards), Sara Lee Lucas (drums), Daisy Berkowitz (guitar) and Marilyn Manson, the singer (his real name is Brian Warner). Then, as time passed, the Marilyn Manson character got more attention than the rest and they shortened the band\u2019s name to Marilyn Manson.So now, when people and friends address the singer, they call him \u201cMr. Manson\u201d.
