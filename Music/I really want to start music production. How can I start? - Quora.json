Alesis q49 An audio interface allows you to plugin your mic or guitar or any other instrument, and send the audio signal to your computer that can record it. A midi keyboard, is a device that you use to input data into your software that triggers sounds if various instruments. You can go and watch how they work on YouTube. It is very simple. After this, learn to use a digital audio workstation(DAW). A daw is a software that allows you to compose, arrange, record and produce music on your computer. There are various DAWs to choose from like cubase, Ableton, Logic Pro, reaper, fruity loops, etc. Pick one of these and focus on getting familiar with it as much as possible. In the beginning try to figure out how to record multiple layers of audio into your software. Learn how to copy paste them, loop them, etc. Learn to use equalizers, compressors and audio effects like reverb, chorus, delay, etc. Download libraries of VST instruments which are musical instruments that have been sampled so that their sounds can be played using your midi keyboard. Read about sampling and how to use it. Watch tutorials on how to operate different sound libraries. Learn how to record instruments like guitar, drums, vocals, etc. This would require you to learn micing techniques to get the best sound out of your instrument or vocals.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start by defining the process of music production by separating it into six basic stages: SongwritingArrangingTrackingEditingMixingMasteringSONGWRITING  What it does it mean to write a song when so much of today\u2019s music is wordless? This is a great question for another article. But for our purposes, let\u2019s say that songwriting is the process of putting musical ideas together to form a larger structure of coherent melody, harmony and rhythm. It\u2019s the process of brainstorming that results in a beginning, middle and end. What makes a good song? This is also highly debatable, but a question I\u2019m more willing to take on. A good song in terms of content will depend on the listener and what they\u2019re drawn to. It\u2019s totally subjective. However, a good song in terms of craft can be identified more objectively, and will usually have all the elements listed above (i.e. melody, harmony, rhythm, beginning, middle, and end) and will be put together in a way that\u2019s pleasantly recognizable while still being creative and true to the message of the music. When it comes to lyrics, I like to think of prosody \u2013 how the lyrics and music work together to support each other. It\u2019s not enough to have good lyrics from a literary perspective. They also need to sound musical when the singer sings them. A good song will develop as it goes along, taking us on a familiar path littered with surprises along the way to make sure we\u2019re listening. The melody (what the singer sings) will fit with the harmony (what the guitars, bass and synths mostly play) in a way that\u2019s pleasing to the ear, using repetition to help the listener get used to the chord progression before transitioning to the next section and a different set of chord progressions. A good song will also have a good sense of rhythm and can make your foot tap with the groove, whether or not there\u2019s a drummer playing. For many people the songwriting process is tied into the tracking process as they start with a drum loop and build from there, recording new ideas on top of each other until they end up with a finished song. Even though this may be a different method than the singer/songwriter who sits with their guitar and notebook to sketch out a tune, the result should still be evaluated according to the same guidelines: Are the melody and harmony catchy enough to stay in your head after the song is done? Does the track keep your attention with new ideas as it develops? Does it groove? Taking away all other aspects of the production, if you had to play the song bare with only one instrument and a vocal (or just an instrument), is it a good song? If not, the rest won\u2019t matter very much. But get this one right from the start and the rest will roll out with ease. ",
