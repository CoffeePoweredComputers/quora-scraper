            "answer_text": "Fail? That's not the appropriate words to be used for a person who is madly in love with music. the actual word is \u201cstrive\u201d. They might fall down but they will sooner or latter get back up and give the hell out of them. Regardless, the few who achieve a long-term career in music are those who, at some point, grow up and become adults. Meaning: they take responsibility for themselves, they do their homework, they plan and prepare, they follow through, they show up. So many musicians are flakes \u2014 it\u2019s as if there\u2019s no competition if you treat your career, at minimum, like any other day job in the world. The fact remains, the music industry is a terrible place to earn a living, especially if you\u2019re a musician. It\u2019s the law of supply and demand. Too many musicians and no demand for them. There is, however, demand for a few remarkable musicians. And even if their original creations can\u2019t find their way to a general audience, they can usually achieve base financial survival by doing clinics, lessons, recording sessions, instructional videos, and playing in sophisticated bands for 20 drunk dudes eating potatoes in a barn in North Hollywood. And it still won\u2019t be easy, even for the greatest among them. The rest of the so-called musicians are NOT motivated by survival in the adult world. It\u2019s hard to do rational, everyday business with them. Go ahead and try. They have such a strange relationship with money that even the mention of it can trigger spasms of paranoia and self-sabotage. Yet\u2026 musicians are motivated by money \u2014 but only large, lump sums of it. It\u2019s easier to seduce them with these things: 1.) Freedom. They don\u2019t want to care what time of the day it is, or even what day it is. That\u2019s where the large, lump sum of money helps. 2.) Fame / Glory. They\u2019ll only do things that their heroes did. \u201cPaul Gilbert went to Musicians Institute, therefore, if I go to Musicians Institute, I am Paul Gilbert.\u201d It\u2019s called the Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle, and it applies to everything in the music industry: venues, record labels, magazines, joining established bands, etc. 3.) Sex. Because they figured out way back in high school that playing music was the only way they\u2019d be at all tolerable or attractive. Yep, they\u2019ll take action for those things, but not much else. They won\u2019t take a job or gig that requires sustained action or steady commitment. They don\u2019t want to work. Meaning, they don\u2019t want to have to trade goods and services with other members of society in order to support their own survival. They think they\u2019re special. They expect to have all of their needs met by the world in return for playing, which is a convenient term to use here. In a lot of cases, they either hated or were, at the very least, disappointed by their parents. And often subconsciously, they made the choice that being an adult would automatically make them like those people. Those miserable alcoholics, those losers who never followed their dreams, those boring mowers of lawns. Musicians are often those teenagers who used their guitar as an escape pod. And they were lucky. At the time, it was their only hope for not becoming their parents. They just don\u2019t realize they don\u2019t need to spend the rest of their life in it. Later on, it manifests as needing to prove to their parents and everyone else that they can have a job that\u2019s \u201ccool.\u201d In extreme cases, they move to Los Angeles, The Peter Pan Syndrome Capital of the World. Hollywood itself is a big, dirty Disneyland for perpetual teenagers. Kinda scary to see how many people are sucked into and drown in the \u201cmaking it\u201d quicksand. So many poor choices they make\u2026 But they do have the choice to learn and grow, to continue along the natural path of maturing as humans\u2026 to become powerful, wise, strong adults. The secret is to try something new: overcoming the fear of responsibility. To avoid that is truly pathetic. look where Bryan Adams is today after having a super flop start of his career, yet he dint stop. People thought he failed, but only he knew that the card he was playing was the I AM WINNING card. The rest is history\u2026\u2026.. Happy reading! Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, before I answer the question, you really need to define \u2018failure\u2019 first. Different musicians have different goals; some only want to learn music so that they can play or sing their favourite songs to entertain their fellow friends or family members, while others want commercial success or see it as the only thing they are really good at. Accordingly, people define failure (and accordingly, success) differently, which is why this can be a rather broad question to answer. That being said, if \u2018failure\u2019 in your eyes is lack of commercial success within their respective styles, then these are some reasons I can think of: Lack of an \u2018x-factor\u2019. Having talent is only winning half of the battle when it comes to commercial success in music; possessing an \u2018x-factor\u2019 that gives you a distinctive niche from others in the market is the other half you need to win. Josh Groban is commercially successful for his distinctive, classically-trained voice that separates him from other mainstream singers; when we hear his songs such as To Where You Are and You Raise Me Up, we can quickly associate them with him even if we might not know who the singer is. Taylor Swift, as another example, is not the most flawless pop singer in the business and is often criticised for her very out of tune live performances, but she for sure makes it up with her songwriting and marketable image.Not knowing who to contact or associate one\u2019s self with. Connections with other musicians/talent agents are extremely important for mainstream success; ultimately that is how a musician finds support, obtains feedback to improve, and eventually earns his or her exposure needed for the desired big break.Being difficult to work with other people. You can be one of the most talented guitarists, vocalists, or drummers around, but if you are hard to work with (and this often applies to extremely arrogant musicians), expect lesser people wanting to create music with you.Maybe just lack of talent altogether. Watch every American Idol or X-Factor audition episode where tons of contestants sing (or more accurately, yell) off-key and do not even know they are singing the wrong notes as an example - enough said.",
