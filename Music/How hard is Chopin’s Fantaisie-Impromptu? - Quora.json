            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer from my perspective. I\u2019ve played by ear my whole life, never took piano lessons ever. I learned to read music by playing Oboe in middle school and high school, and eventually translated that to learning to read piano sheet music. Eventually I sucked it up and googled the fingerings for scales and started practicing those. I\u2019ve researched some technique, and it\u2019s definitely helped me become a much better pianist. But again, never took 1 minute worth of piano lessons. That being said, I sat down and took a stab at Fantaisie-Impromptu. It sounded intimidating at first. But, the version of sheet music I had put the finger numbers over each note. So I basically just used the fingering suggested, and within like 2 weeks, I could basically play it, albeit not at performance level. I still mess up certain passages a little bit, but that can mostly be attributed to rushing and sloppiness. To be honest, I\u2019ve played much more difficult pieces than this, most of which aren\u2019t even classical. I don\u2019t know why this ends up on like top 10 lists and everything of \u201chardest songs ever\u201d. One particular reason I\u2019m always dumbfounded by this claim is that if you pay attention, there is not one single chord played on the right hand, until the last measure. This means after every note, you have more (feasible) options of what finger to choose for the next note. Songs become much more difficult when you\u2019ve got multiple melody lines with chords and arpeggios mixed together. Fingerings become awkward, and achieving the desired dynamic can be really challenging when you\u2019re fighting that. It\u2019s not really as much of an issue in this song. tl;dr: From my perspective as basically an amateur who never took real lessons (but can read music and plays for fun), this piece isn\u2019t as hard as it might seem. There are no chords on the right hand, and if you get a version with the fingerings written in, just follow that and you should be able to play it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the answer is that if you have to ask that question, then you\u2019ll find it very hard to learn to play Chopin\u2019s Fantaisie-Impromptu. It\u2019s like somebody who asks \u201cHow difficult is it to understand Einstein\u2019s Maths ? Well, for me it\u2019s simple. I can look at a page of Einstein\u2019s maths and I see that it\u2019s all a con. Einstein was a big con man. His theory of relativity is an amazing use of the mathematical language in order to dupe people. The collective almost religious conviction that the World is going to end soon might have been put into jeopardy if people had known that it is perfectly possible to produce spaceships that travel at thousands of times faster than the speed of light. Einstein intended to make everybody believe the easier option that there was no wonderful future for Humanity, all through his theory of relativity. Of course, it\u2019s very difficult to get a spaceship through the light barrier but it\u2019s not impossible at all. It doesn\u2019t need a Warp Drive or anything like that, but it does need incredibly powerful engines, an alternating states mechanism for the interior of the spaceship to stop people from being liquified by the acceleration, and it needs a very special hull to stop the spaceship from \u201cstreaming out\u201d, which is what would happen if things went wrong. If things were not perfectly done the whole spaceship would disintegrate, meaning it would stream out in an intense beam of blue light and nothing would be left of it ,and its occupants would suffer hideous pain for several long minutes as they were transformed into the beam of blue light. Obviously this would be mortal for them. Actually producing interstellar spaceships, the first generation ships would take at least 70 years of non-stop work, by tens of millions of workers including hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers. Therefore it\u2019s simply easier to believe Einstein\u2019s theory, which is simply poetic mathematics. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is all pure mathematics that has no relation to reality. You can have an almost infinite number of hidden dimensions in Nature, and many zillions of hidden dimensions have come to exist without anybody noticing it in this dimension here. Nature comprehends all existing Universes and all things that will exist and ever have existed. Time can run at different rates in each parallel dimension and therefore Einstein\u2019s space time theory is all a load of unscientific garble. A load of nonsense in other words. Einstein made clever nonsense but it remains nonsense just the same. People have before theorised that it wasn\u2019t possible to go through the sound barrier and before that people even wrote theories that said it wasn\u2019t possible to exceed 60mph in a train without disastrous effect for the passengers. Of course it was relatively easy to prove those people wrong. But, it really would need a big effort to prove Einstein wrong. One common aspect of Humanity is that its members prefer to believe lies than the truth. Human beings are simply made like that, in this Universe here. They were made like that for a specific reason. In other Universes there have been very truthful Human beings, who had extensive knowledge of Nature. So, I\u2019d guess that if you are a pianist asking how difficult it is to play that piece of Chopin -the Fantaisie-Impromptu-, you aren\u2019t capable of playing it all that easily. It\u2019s difficult to play it well, I remember. But, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth trying to play it just the same. ",
