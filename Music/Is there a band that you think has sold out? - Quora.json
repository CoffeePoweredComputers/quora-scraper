            "answer_text": "Maroon 5  Now I\u2019d first like to clarify what I interpret selling out as.I think of \u201cselling out\u201d as when a band or musical artist changes their sound in order to sell to a more mainstream audience. I don\u2019t think the punk version of selling out, signing to a major label, is actually selling out, as signing to a major label does not necessarily mean the musical artist has changed their sound in anyway. Now to Maroon 5. When Maroon 5 first formed they were actually a grunge band called Kara\u2019s Flowers.  I\u2019ve listened to them when they were a grunge band and they actually weren\u2019t bad at all. However, when they released this album and their follow-up album, The Fourth World, grunge was on its way out of mainstream popularity and thus Kara\u2019s Flowers did not achieve much commercial success and later disbanded.A few years later the members of Kara\u2019s Flowers got together after having gone their separate ways and decided to form a new band\u2014Maroon 5.During their time apart, each of the members listened to a wide array of music ranging from blue-eyed soul to funk and created a new unique sound for Maroon 5\u2019s debut album, Songs About Jane.  With Songs About Jane they found instant success. The album went platinum across the world and soon Maroon 5 songs such as \u201cThis Love\u201d and \u201cSunday Morning\u201d were all over the radio. I believe the primary reason this album went on to become as popular as it did was because nobody had ever heard a band that sounded like Maroon 5 before. Its unique blend of musical sounds in a commercial pop sound made Maroon 5 stand out among their peers. The band maintained their unique sound for several years and incorporated even more sounds in their follow-up albums It Won\u2019t Be Soon Before Long and Hands All Over. But I believe the band started to show signs of selling out when they released this single:  I personally enjoy Moves Like Jagger, but it is interesting to note that compared to the rest of the songs on Hands All Over (the re-issue) this song sticks out like a sore thumb. Whereas the majority of Hands All Over sticks to Maroon 5\u2019s original sound, Moves Like Jagger is an electronic-influenced dance-pop song similar to other songs released in the early-2010\u2019s. Not to mention this song was among the first the band co-wrote with \u201chit-making\u201d producer Shellback (they would also go on to co-write with another hit-making producer, Max Martin). I believe this need to stay dominate on the charts is when Maroon 5 started to show their true intentions. On Maroon 5\u2019s next album, Overexposed, they went further into the synth-pop based direction they had shown with Moves Like Jagger, and nearly half of that album was co-written with either Shellback, Max Martin, or Ryan Tedder. Critics began to take notice of this attempt to maintain a more mainstream sound[1]. On the next Maroon 5 album, V, they went even further with this electropop sound and hired over 15 producers to produce this album to pop perfection. Again, critics took notice of the band trying to sound like whatever \u201cthe kids\u201d are into today[2]. I think the band reached it\u2019s most blazingly obvious point of selling out with this album:  Everything about this album is the definition of selling out. The kids are into Snapchat these days? Let\u2019s make the album cover pictures of our faces using Snapchat filters. The kids like trap artists like Future and Kendrick Lamar? Let\u2019s feature them on our songs. The kids like Chainsmokers-sounding house/EDM music? Let\u2019s make this album a complete rip-off of that sound. The point I\u2019m trying to make here with this is that after a certain point Maroon 5 have done everything in their power to try and stay relevant by following whatever trends are going on in popular music. And I think that in their pursuit of maintaining popularity they kinda forgot who they are as a band. Although they now have 7 members, they don\u2019t sound like they do. They don\u2019t sound like a band anymore. That\u2019s all I have to say about them, but just listen to their music relative to what time it was released and you can tell they have sold out.

            "answer_text": "Without knowing very intimately what was in the hearts and minds of various musicians over time, it\u2019s very difficult to argue that they \u201csold out\u201d. I mean that, while we might assume that when Journey was focused on creating complex fusion music, that they were driven by a purely artistic vision, with no interest in popularity or financial remuneration. But how can we be sure? For all we know, this is what the band thought would sell the most records. Or, they could have had a deliberate strategy, such as, \u201clets get some artistic credibility going by creating this artsy, complex music out there, and then once we\u2019ve done that, we can move on to more commercial music\u201d. If this is true, then the band didn\u2019t sell out, because it never had any real integrity in the first place. Is a band to be respected more if it never had any integrity? But even if some bands started out with a tremendous amount of integrity and authenticity, and then over time became greedier, and progressively \u201csold out\u201d, I think it\u2019s a mistake to judge them for it. Because, if you knew more about what was really going on even in your favorite band, you would probably realize there\u2019s an awful lot you could judge. We\u2019re talking about human beings here, not martyrs or saints. Imagine you have this band, and you\u2019ve put out several albums of complex or challenging music which is satisfying to you creatively, but isn\u2019t selling well. You feel great about the music and enjoy performing it, but when very few people are buying your records or showing up at your concerts, and it\u2019s getting more difficult to even remain viable as a band, wouldn\u2019t you begin to question your commitment to authenticity? I can easily imagine \u201cselling out\u201d as a musician. In a way, I personally have done the ultimate sell out. Instead of ever pursuing music as a profession, I chose to do music solely as a hobby. So I play guitar just for fun, and I can play whatever I want, whenever I want. Most of my hours are dedicated to working at a normal job. Why isn\u2019t this a valid decision for musicians? They can play complex fusion music, or whatever, in their free time, and play commercial music as their \u201cday job\u201d. By the way, there is no segment of the music world more competitive than commercial pop music. People can judge all these bands who sold out, but it\u2019s practically every band out there really, who didn\u2019t break up or have key members die. And again, we don\u2019t really know that they weren\u2019t \u201cselling out\u201d even when they were making music we really love and see as crucial moments in the history of music. One might assume that if a band is playing something other than pop music, they have more integrity. I believe this is blatantly false. Since pop is the most competitive genre of music, many bands may have quite reasonably decided to sell out (make music to make money and gain fame) in a different genre. If I open a restaurant, purely to make money, I might be smart not to open yet another pizza restaurant. I believe that many bands have deliberately put out albums that were designed to be highly artistic, but were actually \u201cstrategic moves\u201d which were intended solely to please music critics. The albums were not actual products of inspiration and authentic musical discovery, they were self-conscious, contrived products made solely to impress critics and to establish musical credibility. And in many cases, this has worked well. If I were to name some of these albums, you would think I was crazy, but this is because people generally believe in critics far more than they do in their own sense of what is really good. My point is that there are many ways to \u201csell out\u201d, and even music which is bizarre and hard to like can be designed to make be more successful in the long term. If you look at even the best bands of all time, and focus on the musicians\u2019 hair clothing, jewelry selections, etc, you would see that very few of them tried very hard to be different from what was expected of them in their time. In the late 60\u2019s, how many rock musicians had short hair, wore ordinary clothes, etc? Why isn\u2019t it seen as \u201cselling out\u201d, that they conformed to the obvious stereotype of a cool, authentic hippie-musician? At some level, weren\u2019t they catering to the demands of a consuming culture which expected musicians to look and act a certain way? Wouldn\u2019t it have been more authentic if they didn\u2019t conform to these stereotypes? I have massive respect for Jimi\u2019s music, but was it 100% authentic for him to dress this way? Didn\u2019t these cool hippie threads help make him more popular and successful? Didn\u2019t it help his career to continue playing his iconic right-handed Stratocaster, when he could have his choice of great left-handed guitars?  ",
