            "answer_text": "This is not an \u201cofficial\u201d definition, but then again, genres and rules are all made up anyway. But, I define Synthwave as a type of Retrowave. Meaning, Retrowave is the genre and Synthwave is the sub-genre. Personally, I define Retrowave as any modern music made to sound like it\u2019s from any past era, but most commonly the 1980\u2032s, 1990\u2019s, and 1970\u2032s. And I personally define Synthwave as being Retrowave music that is synth-heavy or focused on the synth elements. So, this is music that sounds blatantly 1980\u2019s, but features a lot of synth as (one of) its main element(s). An example of Synthwave would be:   In the 1980\u2019s, synth elements in music were quite common and synthwave as a genre likes to put heavy focus on this, but a modern song can still sound 1980\u2019s without being Synthwave. For example, THIS is a song I would classify as just general 1980\u2019s Retrowave:  It has a 1980\u2019s aesthetic feel to it and sounds like something Kenny Loggins might have done back in that era. It\u2019s not really electronic in nature, but grittier and more rock-ish almost. This song is definitely NOT Synthwave, but it\u2019s definitely 1980\u2019s in sound.  Again, I am no genre stickler and I just kind of break down genres based on how I understand them as I hear them, so this information might not be widely agreed upon, but it makes sense to me. ",
