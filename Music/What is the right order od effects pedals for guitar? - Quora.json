            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cright\u201d order of effects pedals for guitar. Ask anyone who does gain staging using pedals and you\u2019d get at least 3 different answers. At least. And that\u2019s not even considering the actual sound they want from the pedals. And then you have your tuners and wah pedals and modulations and delays and reverbs. It gets even more complicated when you throw in stuff like bit crushers, synths, and even the f*king Dalek box (ring modulator). There is, however, a general starting template for someone to put their pedals in order before they move it around to get the sound they need. TunerCompressorSynthesizerOctaver/Pitch Shifter/HarmonizerWah/Envelope FollowerOverdrive/Distortion/FuzzModulation (Chorus/Phaser/Flanger)Weird sh*t (Bitcrusher/Ring Modulator)BoostAmp (if there is an effects loop)Time (Delay/Tremolo/Slicer)ReverbDo know that even this order will be something a lot of guitarists will disagree with! For example, guitarists who do gain staging will put the Boost before the last Overdrive/Distortion pedal (they usually have more than one). Some guitarists put the Boost after the last OD/Dist to get a clean boost of a distorted tone for more volume but no change in compression and tone. Some people like me put the boost after the weird stuff to accentuate the effects during a solo. Some guitarists will put the Modulation effects after the amp in the effects loop. The Ring Modulator is another thing, as some people will consider it a tone shaping tool which will be modified by the Modulation effects, and some will put it after Modulation or Time effects to get extra grit. Most guitarists usually put the Volume pedal before Time based and Reverb effects to get a trail effect, which is especially popular in worship. Some guitarists put it after reverb so that they can also cut the tails for a gated sound. So you see, everything is really up to you! ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t really a \u201cright order\u201d to how you order it. Different guitarists order their pedals in a different way for a different sound or effect (for example, I put a volume pedal after my gain stages because volume can affect how much drive the tone has, some people put it before for that exact reason). While there isn\u2019t an exact order, here\u2019s somewhat of a basic guideline that plenty of people stick to: TunerWahPitch shifterGain/drive pedals\u2014ranging from a compressor that\u2019s always on to fuzz or distortionVolumeChorus/flanger/phaser/tremolo (I don\u2019t really know what order those should go in. Really, whatever works for you)DelayReverbLooper pedal, if you have oneAlso keep in mind many guitarists prefer to use an effects loop instead of putting all their effects in front of their amplifier. I normally do everything before the time-based effects (chorus, flanger, delay, etc) in front, with everything else in a sort of effects loop (my amp doesn\u2019t have an effects loop, but I use a stereo system from the headphones out so I wire it all in series).
