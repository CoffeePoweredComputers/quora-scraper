            "answer_text": "Woah, A2A\u2019d for my own question, wonder how that happened (Thanks Anna Sharudenko ) So I like primarily 5 genres that I\u2019ll consistently listen to, some more than others. It turns out that now I\u2019m on a Hip-Hop binge. The five genres, from all time favorite to least is Metal. Especially melodic death metal (After the burial, Children of Bodom, Kalmah, Born of Osiris).Classic Rock. Especially Jimi Hendrix, and other 60\u2019s classic rock. 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s are good as well.Hip-Hop. 90% of what I listen to is pre 2004. This includes NWA, Wu-Tang Clan, Biggie, Method Man and RedmanElectronic Music. I listen to this when I\u2019m gaming. This ranges from chip tunes to house music.Classical. When I study. Funny enough, I started listening to classical music because I was a dumb college freshman who believed in the Mozart effect - Wikipedia. I thought that was the reason that I did well on that economics test lol. But yeah it pretty much stuckNow in terms of specific songs I like now, here\u2019s another list: Metal Listen to those harsh vocals and clean voice. A combination which showcases her talent. Broken down like a court case none the less, the harsh voice is the prosecution, the clean is the defendant. Pretty creative IMO. Hip-Hop He rhymes Orange with things, that\u2019s pretty damn impressive Classic Rock Could play this song\u2019s solo live with his teeth\u2026 WITH HIS TEETH Electronic music This song incorporates a sound bit from a game I play, Hearthstone. The \u201cGet Down\u201d voice is from the card \u201cNoble Sacrifice.\u201d You can see why I like this song for gaming. 5. Classical. While I\u2019ve been doing work I\u2019ve been listening to this compilation.  This compilation got me through undergrad and grad school. I\u2019ve listened to it 100\u2019s of times but still come back for more. Thanks for the A2A again :D ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a medley of three songs that I found on youtube \u2014 Half-breed; Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves; and Dark Lady. All by Cher of course. She\u2019s singing them live in the video. I\u2019m a big fan of narrative songs, and all three of these are narratives. I\u2019m also a big fan of 70s music, which I didn\u2019t really get into until I pretty much gave up on contemporary music in the early 2000s. A lot of the stuff from the 70s is new to me. I\u2019ve listen to this melody four times today. Twice when walking my dog, once when making dinner, and I\u2019m listening to it as I write this.  ",
