            "answer_text": "Better? Or just different? Let\u2019s look at \u201cLayla\u201d, original and unplugged. Very different in presentation, soloing and vocal attack. If I want a song to get my heart pumping, it\u2019s definitely going to be the original Cream version. If I\u2019m just walking around doing things, I probably would prefer the unplugged version. If your taste in music leans more to the ballads or soft pop, I can understand your point of view. But generally I just view them as a different song. Not better or worse than the other. Just to be fair though, I have heard acoustic versions that I did like better but it was do to really not liking the song in the first place and the different arraingement made it more to my liking. But I still think of it as a different song. ",

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. Not in my opinion anyway. A good rock song is exactly that - rock; play it acoustically and all the life and joy and power is sucked out of it. I tried watching the MTV Unplugged series (back in the days when Music TeleVision actually played music - remember those?) and was completely at a loss to understand why it was so hugely popular. Don\u2019t get me wrong - I adore acoustic guitar music, own a beautiful Taylor 614ce and play in an acoustic duo (as well as having many electric guitars, too many amps, and play in two rock bands) but there are very few, if any, rock songs that sound good acoustically. But as I said \u2026 purely my opinion. ",
