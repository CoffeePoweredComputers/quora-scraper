            "answer_text": "French. But English beats both. If you are reading this, of course it is not an issue. :-) German is spoken in just 2 countries: Germany, and Austria. Some part of Switzerland also talks German, it is one of the three official languages. Other than that there isn't any single country speaking German. Germany was never a colonial empire, so there isn't any country that speaking German as a second language. But if we take a look at French, French speaks French. Some part of Belgium speaks it, and again some part of Switzerland. But when we get to the colonial part the picture really changes. Most Africa, Lebanon at Middle East, some Far East Countries, Quebec of Canada, some minor islands at the oceans speak France as their preferred or second language. Another advantage of French is that it is easy to learn Spanish and Italian as both these languages are close relatives. For me, I worked in a German company for 5 years. The company is a German company but its official language is English. I never needed to speak German. In meetings where I was the only person who could not speak German, they all spoke English, the company language was then and still is English, not German. French companies do not have such an approach. Answer: If you are planning to live in Germany or Austria or German cities of Switzerland, learn German, if you are planning to live in France, Belgium or French cities of Switzerland or want to make business with Africa, Lebanon or Far East, or want to work in French companies learn French. For Latin America of course Spanish beats them all. My brother - he has business with North Africa, is trying to learn French diligently, as he thinks that English simply not enough, I worked in a German company, during that time visited Germany several times, and never thought seriously about learning German. OK? ",

            "answer_text": "French is more logical language than German and it is easier to learn also as it is quite similar to english. Plus, the vocabulary of french and english is also somewhat similar (I dont say that because i know french, i am saying that because i have felt that when i started learning french). German grammar is very difficult, and Frenchvocabulary is quite similar to English, so that makes it easier as well. So take the language YOU are more interested in; it would be difficult to learn a language you don't like, even if it is \"easier\". I vote French, but my lessons did used to be shocking. Now if you are taking only about german and french so i would tell only between these two languages - Whereas german has only 90 million, french has 274 million speakers. So, french is the more widely spoken language. French is one of the very few languages spoken all over the world, ranked the sixth most widely spoken language after Mandarin Chinese (over a billion speakers), English, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic. There are currently over 220 million French speakers worldwide, including 72 million so-called partial French speakers. Europe accounts for 39.87% of the French-speaking population, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean for 36.03%, North Africa and the Middle East for 15.28%, America and the Caribbean for 7.66% and Asia/Oceania for 1.16% (OIF, La langue fran\u00e7aise dans le monde, 2010). As a result of population growth, the OIF estimates that the number of French speakers will rise to over 700 million by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa. This would take the proportion of French speakers in the world population from 3% to 8%. French is one of the working languages of the United Nations alongside English, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese. French is one of the three procedural languages of the European Union, along with English and German, and the sole language used for the deliberations of the Court of Justice of the European Union. NOW COMING TO THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE : French shares with English the distinction of being taught as a foreign language in the education systems of most countries around the world. French is thus the second most widely learned foreign language in the world, with almost 120 million students and 500,000 teachers. So, now you can decide by yourself which is more useful to learn. BONNE CHANCE!!! ",
