            "answer_text": "Yes. Kanye West is a musical chameleon. Whether it be the lush and orchestral textures of Late Registration or the minimalist landscape of Yeezus, he dares never to work with a comfortable and proven formula. He\u2019s always challenging contemporaries. Challenging listeners. Challenging popular music. And challenging himself with an amorphous musical philosophy. He is not in the business of communicating his art through a prism of conventions; in a method true to him, he demonstrates an obsession to destroy them. Releasing eight solo albums, including four in four years, with moderately to radically different musical backdrops in just over a decade, Kanye West is Beatles-esque in his ability to stand emphatically in popular music while remaining the world\u2019s premier nonconformist. Something I would like to add about West that I do not think gets mentioned enough: he boasts maybe the most extensive and diverse collaborator list ever. Electro/House duo Daft Punk, record producer Rick Rubin, film score composer Jon Brion, RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan; and on the performer side, Neo-Soul Singer-Songwriter Sampha, Electro/Indie Pop Singer-Songwriter Sia, Chris Martin from Coldplay, Justin Vernon from Indie Folk band Bon Iver, Adam Levine from Maroon 5 and many more in and outside Hip Hop can say they have had prominent features in his music. And these features from these many performers are not weak, frivolous inputs. They are commonly solid and even eclectic, with some even stealing the show from Kanye himself. This is a hallmark of a great music producer in another sense\u2014here West finds, in this endless sea of musical and thematic shifts, a way to optimize said collaborators talent. I have forgotten the litany of instances in which I have learned of an artist through a standout performance on a Kanye West song, only to refer to their underwhelming solo work. His ability to discern, and more importantly showcase talent\u2014more than the artist themselves realize, is remarkable. Whether it be offering to produce Paul McCartney\u2019s album, not even rapping for the entire duration of 808s & Heartbreak, or recently expressing desire to link up with Bob Dylan, West has redefined what it means to be a rapper and musician by operating in his own vein; one that is without mold or boundary. Though he may be the most divisive man of his day, make no mistake about his musicianship. A resolute exploratory figure, he is the most important artist of the 21st century. And he is a genius. Kanye's been playing the long game all along, and we're only just beginning to see why. \u2014Elon Musk ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to go out on a limb here and say an emphatic YES. Before anyone reads a different meaning into my answer, let me clarify- Kanye West is not a lyrical genius in the same way that Jay-Z, B.I.G., Nas, Eminem or Big Pun are. He is not as technically gifted as they are (although he has absolutely improved in this regard compared to his college dropout days). However, his lyrics always manage to strike a mind-blowing level of honesty and a ridiculous level of observational detail. He is also somehow able to make people from completely different backgrounds love his music and actually know and recite his words. People don't like Kanye West because he is able to come up with lines like: Too many Urkels on your team that's why your Wins-low  But because time and time again he says things like: They say I talk with so much emphasis/Ooooooh they sooo sensiitiveee  Seriously who says this? We all think it, but he's the only one that managed to put it in a rhyme)  What's a black beatle anyways? A fuckin roach? I guess thats why the put me in fuckin coach  Face it Jerome, get searched more times than Brandon/ Look all through my bags act like its random These are lines that even a ten year old can understand. The honesty, simplicity and all around accessibility of his lines will win over a crowd way more times than a more technically capable rapper.  See this friendly battle with Mos Def   Notice how Kanye gets more people laughing and more into his rhymes than the obviously more technically impressive Mos Def. Make no mistake, this is a lyrical skill and it is certainly as genius as it gets (\"Can you please donate sex to the poor\"????).  I will also go out on a limb to say that the more technically capable rappers can not rap like Kanye West. On the other hand Kanye West has become more technically adept over the years and feels right at home on a song with any of the best rappers (Jay-Z pretty much admitted to Kanye's verse being better than his on Run This Town). When it's all over and the curtains are drawn, I really do hope that people pay him his due and recognize that he is not just a great producer that raps. I hope they realize that what he does lyrically is truly special. ",
