            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about refusing, but there are plenty of artists that simply wouldn\u2019t ever need to use autotune. I once stood and watched Lady Gaga while she sang some a capella stuff for a fan and have them a few vocal tips \u2026 she wouldn\u2019t even need amplification in some venues, let alone autotune. I was about 20ft away but, in addition to being perfectly on pitch, the power and just sheer volume of air she can move when she sings is insane. There are plenty of opera and musical theater singers out there that are still another order of magnitude above any pop singer that\u2019s ever been on the Billboard charts in terms of vocal skill and intonation. I\u2019ve heard that smaller theatres sometimes use live autotune for chorus lines and such nowadays, which is disappointing to hear about but I\u2019ve never seen/heard direct evidence of this. I would generally say any singer who has years of training and has put in lots of hours of practice time over those years wouldn\u2019t ever need to rely on autotune \u2014 unless it was to use it as an effect. Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, don\u2019t use autotune for pitch correction \u2014 but similarly, they\u2019ve been immersed in music since they were toddlers and they each have quite a few years of choir singing/training on top of that, so I can\u2019t see them ever needing to use those sorts of filters. This Rolling Stone video shows the lengths they went to just for the vocals on Billie\u2019s hit, \u201cBad Guy\u201d.  ",

            "answer_text": "I would guess that autotune is used in the studio a lot more than the public realizes.  However, it's not something that an artist is going to freely admit to. I disagree with comparing it to steroids in baseball.  It's cheating in baseball because baseball has rules.  There's no official rule book for making music.  Does it really matter if a singer makes a \"perfect\" compilation of 50 takes, or just does two and uses some autotune? I agree that the ability to sing in perfect pitch is a talent, but I don't believe in putting down those who choose to use autotune.  Just remember that if you want to be anti-autotune, for consistency in your beliefs, you should also be against fretted instruments.  Clearly, playing a fretless guitar requires more talent than the common fretted one. For me, what matters is what the finished product sounds like. ",
