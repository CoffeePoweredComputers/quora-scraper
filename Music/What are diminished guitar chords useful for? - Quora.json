            "answer_text": "Diminished chords are often used to enhance a sense of poignancy. Poignancy is an emotion of sadness, pity, sorrow, etcetera. It can express the mind of feelings, anxiety, and even physical pain. It can also describe agreeably intense stimulation, delight, and passion. When a diminished chord resolves (moves into) a dominant or tonic chord the tension, for better or worse, intensifies or abates. A good example of diminished resolution is the early movie dramas involving the helpless woman tied to a railroad track. In the early ages of movie-making, diminished chords in the soundtrack would create extreme anxiety for the victim and intense poignancy for the audience. When the hero enters the scene at the last minute, a fight ensues and the hero finally triumphs, but the damsel in distress is still in great danger because the train is speeding down the rails. More tension there and the audience cringes. In the last seconds, the hero unties the woman and sweeps her out of harm\u2019s way. That is where the anxiety and fear resolve for both the heroine and the audience. A diminished chord is unique because each note of the diminished chord can have a turn being a root note. If a diminished chord evolves through its full cycle it creates more intense poignancy (again, for better or worse). The diminished chord evolves in minor thirds. This creates more harmonic motion as well as three versions. When the full run of the chosen diminished cycle ends, the tonic chord becomes the musical hero because it absorbs both the tonal energy and emotional stress of the diminished chord. What makes diminished chords work is the presence of the tritone intervals. Diminished chords rely on the tritones, their inversions, and resolution into dominant or tonic chords. Similar conditions apply for the augmented chords (augmented chords are cousins of the diminished chords). Augmented chords evolve in major thirds. Each note of an augmented chord can become a root note and the augmented chord can evolve through three versions. Augmented chords can resolve into dominant or tonic chords also. I know that the question was for popular music but the early movie example seemed to be the best way to communicate the content. If it wasn\u2019t for Sweet Sue, the intimidating villain Snidely Whiplash, and the hero in the white hat, the diminished chord might have been out of a job! ",

            "answer_text": "Diminished chords are the ultimate passing chords. What\u2019s a passing chord you ask? That\u2019s the connective tissue between chords. Let\u2019s say you start with C major and want to move to D minor. Throw a C# diminished chord in between and presto: Instant harmonic motion. Basically a diminished chord a half step under your target chord will always sound correct and create a sense of resolution. B dim > C, F# dim > G, D# dim > Em (yes it works with minor chords as well). Diminished 7 chords go even a step further. They act as 4 chords in one. B dim = B D F Ab D dim = D F Ab B F dim = F Ab B D Ab dim = Ab B D F See what I mean? It\u2019s the same 4 notes inverted. When it comes to chords the sooner you realize they do not need to be played in simple root position at all. These 4 chords above are all the same chord but also 4 different chords depending on where they resolve. Diminished 7 chords are really dominant 7 b9 chords. That\u2019s why they resolve so nicely to major and minor chords. They act as a V7b9 chord. Expanding on that last point you can see that a diminished 7 chord will yield a dominant 7 chord by lowering any one note. B dim = B D F Ab Bb7 = Bb D F Ab Diminished chords connect any chord with any other chord. Try it out. EDIT: please note that diminished chords are useful on their own as well, as they create wonderful tension. My answer is geared primarily towards beginner and intermediate musicians. You could write a book about these incredible musical wonders. ",
