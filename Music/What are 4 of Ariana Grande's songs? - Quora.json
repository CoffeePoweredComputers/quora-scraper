            "answer_text": "This has to be split into the albums. To be clear, I love Ari. I\u2019m a huge fan, even though my friends make fun of me for liking a basic VSCO girl artist. Also, I like her songs now and her old songs equally, but it\u2019s for different reasons. Her older songs use more of her vocals, and they lean more towards the pop side of the spectrum. I love her voice, especially her impressive range. Her newer songs (aka the Sweetener and thank u, next albums), are leaning more towards hip-hop and trap. Although it doesn\u2019t use as much of her vocals, I really like the lyrics and the messages. They expand more than the past albums have. I gotta say, my favorite album is thank u, next, with the exception of the more popular songs, which I will explain later.  Yours Truly: Daydreamin\u2019, The Way My Everything: Break Free, One Last Time Dangerous Woman: Into You, Thinking Bout You Sweetener: breathin, no tears left to cry, goodnight n go, sweetener thank u, next: imagine, bloodline, bad idea, needy  Ok to clarify: I like every single song on thank u, next. But if I had to say which song I like the least, it would be break up with your girlfriend, i\u2019m bored. It\u2019s just really repetitive in terms of lyrics, and it doesn\u2019t say anything really meaningful to me. The beat is nice, though, which is why I can tolerate it, and I like lip-synching along to it. thank u, next is just extremely overplayed everywhere. It\u2019s a powerful song. It\u2019s very personal to Ari. It has a great message of self-care and being aware of your own interests are most important. But after it came out it was played e v e r y w h e r e which turned me off a bit. 7 rings is a bit cliche for me and it\u2019s too much of a flex for me. The concept behind the song and the beat is addicting. I really enjoy some of the other songs better, especially the more lowkey songs because they really say something. They\u2019re super personal to Ari and it speaks of her pain and her conflicts. So that\u2019s what I got to say about Ari guys hope you enjoy <3 ",
