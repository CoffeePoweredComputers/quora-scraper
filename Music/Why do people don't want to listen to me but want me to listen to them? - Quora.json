            "answer_text": "People tend to pay attention to what they consider important and beneficial to them. To consider something important, it is necessary to first understand what is being said. Now if this is happening only within a group of \u201cpeople\u201d, you may need not worry a lot. If this is happening everywhere, or almost all the time, even with strangers, we need to analyze it further and find the reason\u2026 why? It could be an issue with communication skills that may need to be improved. Communication skills matter a lot. It is not just verbal / language part, but also include the way you communicate/gestures, expressions, speed and style of communicating with others. Is your communication style monotonous? Do you speak very fast? In general, I noticed that we Indians have a tendency of speaking very fast or slow?. It is to be noted that fluency does not mean speaking fast. Do you speak clearly with proper pauses, where necessary? Do you give time to your audience to grab the meaning of your sentence before you jump to next one? Is your language easily understood? These are some of the questions that may help you do primary analysis. If there are no considerable issues with your communication skills, analyze whether it could be due to contents? Are your contents relevant and to the point (focused on topic)? Are you using very large sentences which are hard to understand, confusing or making it for your audience to loose track easily? You may get a help from some of your friends or family members to find out the reason. Don\u2019t get dis-heartened and be open to feedback because it may give your a chance to improve where you lack. You may also get a recording (through smartphone) of your communication events to analyze it later and see the possible improvement area. ",

            "answer_text": "A very thought provoking question. Every person in the world has at least a thin streak of egotism in his/her personality. This is a quality which is very dominant, as it is a result of our natural instincts, which tell us to think about our well being, and put ourselves before others. It is also important, as it ensures that you stick to your ideologies and remain steadfast with regard to your principles. But this quality, in large amounts, makes a person \u2018self-centred\u2019. Coming to the question, I agree with Sri Ramojushivakumar when he says that people are more worried about themselves than others. You cannot call this behaviour good or bad, it is just human nature. It is indeed a Herculean task to make people respect your point of view, and yes, you will feel cheated when you listen to them and they don\u2019t listen to you. But look at it this way: you get an additional perspective when you listen to a person, and they lose one when they don\u2019t listen to you, and this works in your favour. Moreover, people respect you more if you listen to them, and you actually may come across some person who returns the favour! Again, the advantage lies with you! ",
