            "answer_text": "I apologize up front for this answer, because you aren\u2019t going to like it. You make a really good song with lyrics the same way you get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice. Or, be born with a natural gift for it. But since you asked the question, the only answer for you is the first one. I can really only address the first part of your question, anyway (how to make a really good song) - my attempts at lyrics have been laughable. I\u2019d say, first decide whether the music or the lyrics is more important to you, and work on that. It\u2019s probably easier to fit a melody to words than the other way around, but that\u2019s just my experience. Words suggest rhythm and melodic contour; melody only vaguely suggests a mood, rarely actual lyrics. Writing a good melody is a mysterious process; ask anyone who has tried it, even those who are good at it. You can try either playing chords and humming along with them, or playing (or humming) a tune - with or without chords, depending on your skill level. It\u2019s important to be patient with yourself and to go with your instincts. If you have some sort of recording device, record everything you try. I have a degree in music theory but I haven\u2019t mentioned anything about using it to help you write music. Whether or not you know any theory, I\u2019d advise you not to rely on it; instead, rely on your ear completely. If you can\u2019t trust your ear, you shouldn\u2019t be writing music. The only tricky thing about your ear is the problem of unconsciously writing something you\u2019ve heard before. That bugs me all the time and I\u2019m always on the lookout to try to avoid using someone else\u2019s tune. Back to the initial point I made, make lots of songs, write lots of lyrics. Most of them will be, uh, disappointing, but with practice (practice practice) - and some fine \u201ctuning\u201d - more and more will be something you\u2019ll want to share. ",
