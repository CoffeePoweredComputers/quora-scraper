I knew I wanted to be a musician but I didn\u2019t know how to play any instrument. When I was 7 I heard AC/DC and I knew I wanted to play guitar. If it weren\u2019t for Elvis I probably wouldn\u2019t be a musician today. I\u2019ve played with many of my musical heroes. Released 5 albums so far. Have toured all over and done a lot of things most people only dream about. I credit Elvis Presley for that. Here I am onstage playing with AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams  ",

It was a very interesting night. Unfortunately, Elvis died three years later. Also, I lived in Memphis as a child, but I never got to meet Elvis. ",
