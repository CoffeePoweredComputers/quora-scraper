            "answer_text": "You pose an interesting question. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Paul evolved through his Beatles\u2019 tenure (as they all did). Paul went from being a broke, diffident, rebellious 18 year old (in 1960) to a wealthy, confident, world-beating 28 year old (in 1970, when The Beatles disbanded). But to answer your question, I think it\u2019s largely subjective. Paul was the \u201cCute Beatle\u201d, though John and George had their female admirers, too. Paul is a handsome man and he cleans up well. I don\u2019t think he looks good in facial hair, but I\u2019m sure there are female fans who would disagree. For me, I think Paul looked his best in 1965\u20131966. He would have been 23\u201324 during that time. But he still looks good today (most recently at the March For Our Lives event in New York City on March 24) at age 75 (he\u2019ll be 76 in June). If any of us look half as good as he does when we\u2019re in our mid-70s, then we\u2019d be thrilled. Paul was blessed with good genes and his vegan lifestyle certainly has contributed to his longevity. ",

            "answer_text": "I thought of course he was very cute in his 20s. But to me his Wings years probably till mid 50s he looked his very best. In saying that I also think that\u2019s the age that most men look the best. They look like men rather than boys. He still good looking today. But the question was which year I took it to mean years. I love the pictures of him with salt and pepper hair. So many men as women choose to die their hair these days and he looked great. As a matter fact when he chose to let it go natural I thought for a little while that he should\u2019ve kept it darker. But it\u2019s really grown on me. And also I like to say Paul McCartney yes he\u2019s a good looking man. But to me there\u2019s a depth that he has of character I truly admire and his astonishing music ability comes through in his appearance. I think we call that charisma. More than charisma with McCartney but there you have it ",
