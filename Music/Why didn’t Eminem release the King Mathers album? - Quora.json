            "answer_text": "The album was a real thing but the title was rumored to be called King Mathers started by fellow Shady artist Cashis and many people online. In between 2005\u20132007 he was recording material. The only confirmed/EXTREMELY likely songs to be on the album are: Careful What You Wish For The Apple 50 Ways Syllables GOAT It\u2019s Been Real The album was never released because in December 2007 he overdosed on pills after becoming depressed from losing his best friend Proof (There were more reasons but that\u2019s the main one) so he was sent to the hospital where he nearly died. When he came back he still struggled with drugs but finally in 2008 decided to go to rehab and get clean. Ever since April 20th, 2008, Eminem has been clean and he basically had to restart his career. Also, he had to re-learn how to rap after he was in the hospital and his body started shutting down. When you are that close to dying you can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t move, etc. This is partly why his voice is different combined with age after his overdose. Moving into 2009 he was clean and had a clear head with new ideas and style musically. He avoided using material from his \u2018dark days\u2019 during his addiction. He completely made new material for his album Relapse. He wanted to make music in his new head space so he scrapped a lot of what he was working on because it didn\u2019t fit his new style, it was low quality, it was made while he was very drugged up, and the music reminded him of his depressing addiction era. For the most realistic recreation of this album (With songs from 2005\u20132007 combined with the leaked songs of King Mathers) check out this! :  ",
