            "answer_text": "\"Johann\" is just John in German.  There are a lot of people named John in the english language corner of the world as well, who have shown some success in their particular field of experience.  Add in some Giovannis, Ivans, Juans, Shawns, and... you will find many fields that have a lot of success under the name.  Alternate forms for the name John  The composers you mentioned are all German. So the reason that there are so many Johanns is because \"John\" was a popular name in Germany at the time, a fairly large portion of the population was named \"John\" , and the occurrence of a successful composer being named \"John\" reflects the name's popularity.  I don't think the name itself granted or grants any magical powers, unfortunately. ",
