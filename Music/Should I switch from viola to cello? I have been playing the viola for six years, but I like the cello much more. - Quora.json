            "answer_text": "Sure! You should switch if you like it better. I don\u2019t know if you just play by yourself or in groups. In my opinion, the cello parts are more interesting in string quartets and n orchestra. I can\u2019t comment on string trios, because I know very little of this literature. Cello is an awesome instrument. ",
