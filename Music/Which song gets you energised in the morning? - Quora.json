Motivation: There are days when I have !important meetings or have to appear for something that's going to change the course of my life.

            "answer_text": "Rain On Me - Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs It's around 6 AM today in Jakarta and I got to admit that I just listen to it 1 hour ago, and I listen to it every single day since it came out. This song is different and new to me. Aside from amazing choreography, the lyrics itself have powerful message in it that the song not only energized me, but encouraging me, and it's really uplifting.  Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande also really personal making this song, as Lady Gaga stated in Apple Music interview: [1] \u201cI remember thinking I had cried so many tears that it felt like an unfathomable downpour from my eyes. But even with that much rain, you don\u2019t have to drown\u2026 Even though it feels like you are, you can still swim. And if there\u2019s a strong current with a bunch of waves and they keep crashing over you, if you keep swimming, you\u2019ll reach the center of the ocean, where it\u2019s calm, still, and peaceful. She was so open to trying things that she hasn't done before. She was [like], 'I'm going to just trust you.' And it was this beautiful, I think, very healing process for me... That woman has been through some really tough, really hard life-testing stuff, undoubtedly\u2026 And then this friendship blossomed and this song 'Rain On Me,' the lyrics that I wrote right here in this studio, 'I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive. Rain on me.\u201d Footnotes[1] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXBF9t32zA&t=2356s",
