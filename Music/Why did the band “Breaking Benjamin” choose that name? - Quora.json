            "answer_text": "Back in the days before their fame, Breaking Benjamin was a band playing in bars at open mic nights. One fateful event, the leader, Benjamin Burnley, asked someone at the bar to borrow their mic, as he hadn\u2019t brought one himself. The man obliged and the gig ensued. During the performance, sir Ben Burnley got so into the spectacle that he threw the mic stand down and the mic broke. The man who lent him the mic berated him: \u201cDon\u2019t go breaking other people\u2019s things!\u201d Sir Ben found that statement to be an intriguing one. He played around with it for a moment, before deciding on adding \u201cbreaking\u201d before his name. Thus was born the name of the band, Breaking Benjamin. (I read this story about 3 years ago, so details are a bit fuzzy in places, but the message remains the same.) TL;DR: Breaking Benjamin came from Ben breaking a borrowed mic. ",
