            "answer_text": "Most of NCS\u2019s uploads are copyright-free EDM songs (Electronic Dance Music). What I quite like about NCS\u2019s videos is that all songs have a colour-coded ring visualiser. The colour of the ring tells you what genre the song is: Red = Drumstep (drum dubstep)Orange = Indie dance (the least EDM-like genre)Yellow = House (by far the most popular and common genre)Mint = Glitch hop (only three songs in this genre have been uploaded as of April 2017)Green = Trap (more melodic in general compared to trap from Trap Nation)Turquoise = Chillstep (melodic dubstep)Blue = Dubstep (varies from melodic to wub-wub-wub)Purple = Future house/Future bass (very industrial-ish in my opinion)Pink = DnB (Drum and bass)White = Hardstyle/Electronic (Electronic songs sometimes belong to other genres but are uploaded with a white ring)Black = IDK (the newest genre which was announced out of nowhere)",

They had been commercialised and sold like Stars. For example the song \u201cFaded\u201d from Alan Walker, existed before it was out under the soo called name. NCS is NoCopyrightSongs (otw: nocopyright sounds), means that they are originaly for the use of everyone. From DJs or SMs who\u2019d better let their work for free to anyone to listen to it, than get famous to make factory product music. NCS is a bit about the electronic music it self. ",
