It is rumored that some other bands dollowed their advice with sucess. Caveat emptor, it is not always to actual sucess in life. The other source of info I might get into is perhaps something on viral marketing. While I have not tried its principles Ryan Holiday's Confessions of a Media Manipulator seems to habe good insights.

So far Max Martin has written 22 No.1 hits but if you consider that he's currently in his prime I think it's safe to assume that he may have a good shot at superseding Paul McCartney in given time.
