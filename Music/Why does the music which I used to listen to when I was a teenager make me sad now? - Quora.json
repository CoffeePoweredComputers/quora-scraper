            "answer_text": "Music is that source with which one expresses his/her emotion at a particular moment. The lyrics of a song at times become the words you want to say but can\u2019t. I am a music lover and it is like the oxygen that sustains my life on earth. I had a few songs that I could relate to my life. There were times in my teens when I used to listen to a song, visualise to the peek of imagination and then sleep dreaming the same. I have heard somewhere that rain comes with all the memories one had in the last drizzle, and I think that the same happens when one listens to a song after years. It drives us through the most beautiful ride of memories and maybe that\u2019s why it makes us sad now. ",
