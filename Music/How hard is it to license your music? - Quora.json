            "answer_text": "It's pretty straight forward. First of all you need a good understanding of the types of license that is normally understood to have a demand for, and the terminology around this. Once you have that grounding you can discuss and negotiate with a common language. While you can license your music directly to markets you can also consider signing non exclusive (my recommendation) agreement with rights agencies who will attract licensors to your music. Plenty of those around online nowadays. ",
