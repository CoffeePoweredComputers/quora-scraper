            "answer_text": "The length, especially the length of the main part of the string vs. the thinner end part. Short scale strings may be too short for the long scale. if main windings of any strings aren\u2019t crossing nut the string might not sound right, could damage nut. Long scale strings might be OK on short scale but cutting through main windings might cause the windings to loosen and fray at the end or not fit into the hole at the center of the tuning pegs. (if you use that) Flatwounds may be more of a problem for coming apart at the end. I find the strings have a more detailed harmonic profile and keep their bright new string sound longer if only the thin part is wound on the peg anyway. Heavier gauges of E long scale string might sound dull, weak or floppy on a short scale bass. If strings are hard to find, buy them locally before you need them, ask the shop to order a set or two or order online. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends a bit on how short is short. I play a bass with a 28\u2033 scale length. I like it. But if the strings you select are on the thin side, they will need to be looser to get all the way down to pitch. (strings get lower by being longer, or heavier, or looser). So you might want towards the thicker side of regular bass strings. There are specials sold. I also play a couple REALLY short-scale, at 20.75 and 22 inches.These do use special strings. ",
