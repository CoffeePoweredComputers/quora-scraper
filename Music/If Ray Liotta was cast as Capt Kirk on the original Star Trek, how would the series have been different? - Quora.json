I\u2019ve mentioned this on Quora before, but years ago I read a collection of short stories with alternate Presidents of the US, both stories where people such as MLK, Patton and others became President, and other stories where actual Presidents pursued other career choices. It was one of the latter in which Jack Kennedy ignored his father\u2019s wishes (or maybe Joe Kennedy never died? don\u2019t remember how the story approached this critical turning point) and spurned politics after his Navy career ended, instead going to Hollywood. He was a B movie actor for the most part, until an opportunity came along for him on a new science fiction series called Star Trek, where he assumed the role of Captain Kirk. Cross one of the periods greatest ladies man with a galactic horn dog like the Kirk character, and that would have been something to see! ",

            "answer_text": "The Original Series premiered in 1966. Ray Liotta was born in 1954. So this would essentially be Lost In Space (premiered in 1965), except that 11-year-old Will is in charge of the spaceship for some odd reason. This tween-oriented TV show would seem like a copy of the original Lost in Space, and be targeting the same audience. On the same network. (With the same first name for the lead character, for that matter!) It would never get past the pilot. ",
