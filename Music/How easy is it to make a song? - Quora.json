            "answer_text": "There are some songs that just \u201ccome to you\u201d and others that take a month. As a sometime lyricist, I have had more of the latter experience. I have spoken to other words people who create songs there are two basic categories of preference. 1. Prefers to pen the lyrics and give to musical writer. 2. Prefers to have the music to put the lyrics to. I am of the former, which I understand to be the minority, in lyric writing. Most prefer #1. I like#2 because the Music Tells me what consonants to use, fricatives, plosives, etc. I am a musician and I put the music before the lyrics in terms of priority of function within the song. (I leave the music WRITING to those who are better at it than I am). My strength is in writing lyrics. So I exploit what I do best. But, objectively speaking- the song is the master, and the music it's engine. The lyrics only compliment them. BUT- without them, none is complete. ",
