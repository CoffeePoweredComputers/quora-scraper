            "answer_text": "There are technical issues that can prevent you from attaining speed. Only a skilled teacher can help you overcome these problems. Speed is not just playing slow and gradually speeding up.Speed can be released through great technique.For example learning how to get one hand out of the way of the other.Moving the hands in and out in relation to the fallboard, Forearm rotation,not twisting or stretching the hands,Developing a solid fingering and sticking to it strictly when you practice a given piece. Grouping of notes,phrasing ,shaping and a lot more.Good technique should feel great and not ever cause PAIN.It should be a delight to play .Hard work but it should feel delightful when playing properly .Whenever I have a problem in my playing a piece it is always between two notes.ButI frequently need my teacher to help me through it.He is a very high level player and he still studies with another more advanced pianist. So I believe that there is no substitute for a good teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "Work at your Sight Reading until you gain proficiency. Scale and arpeggio practice is also valuable, because these are piano foundations, and will help you recognise chord formations and figurations more instantaneously. They are forms of exercises that will give you what my teacher used to call \u201cKeyboard facility.\u201d Other useful exercises include \u201cblind\u201d practice: cover your eyes with a scarf and try to play scales, arpeggios and selected keyboard passages without looking at the keys. It is said that this is how Richter learned Rachmaninov\u2019s notoriously challenging 3rd piano concerto. It is also useful for purposes of memorisation. ",
