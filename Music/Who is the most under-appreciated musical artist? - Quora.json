            "answer_text": "Micheal Kiwanuka.  (From one of his music videos) It\u2019s hard to talk/write about good music, you kind of have to\u2026 well, listen too it. But I\u2019ll try my best. If you\u2019ve never heard of Kiwanuka, he\u2019s a British musician born to Ugandan parents and raised in London. His debut studio album Home Again was released in 2011, and he\u2019s continued creating amazing music ever since.  Even if you\u2019ve never heard his name it\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ve heard his songs. Some of his more cinematic pieces have been used movies and TV such as: Big Little LiesThe Get DownWhen they see usAtlantaShamelessKiwanuka spent his early years taking gigs as a session guitarist, even backing up Adele on her 2011 tour. One of Kiwanuka's first songs to get international attention was Love and Hate, the title track for an album that included many other beautiful songs such as One More Night, Black Man In A White World, and Cold Little Heart.  If these sound like melancholy titles, it\u2019s because some of them are. But, the creativity, originality, and just overall feel of his music is actually insane. Anyway, I\u2019m bad at words, so I\u2019ll paste some quotes from people who are famously good at words, Music Critics and YouTube Commenters: \u201cPsychedelic soul\u2026 gospel rock reminiscent of Marvin Gaye, The Rolling Stones, Hendrix\u201d -The Telegraph \u201cTimeless and contemporary\u201d - The Guardian \u201cThat feeling when your nostalgic for a time before you were born\u201d - YouTube commenter \u201cBrilliant, damn Brilliant\u201d - YouTube commenter \u201cStumbled on one of his songs around midnight it\u2019s now 3am and I\u2019m still going strong lol\u201d - YouTube commenter \u201cThe kind of song you will search for, and feel pure satisfaction when you find it\u201d - YouTube commenter I could go on, but you get the point. If you haven\u2019t already cued up one of his playlists\u2026 cmon what are you doing with your life?  \u2206\u2206\u2206 ",

            "answer_text": "This little list is quite personal. You\u2019re invited to take it or leave it. Lowell George. Nominal leader of Little Feat from 1970 to \u201879, he was a songwriter, singer, guitarist and producer. Little Feat released a string of albums that were critically acclaimed but they never quite hit it big. Sadly, ol\u2019 Lowell died young due, at least in part, to his penchant for self-abuse. Jimmy Page once said in an interview that Feat was his favorite American band. High praise indeed. Here\u2019s a good example of his songwriting, singing and guitar playing skills (on slide). It also showcases what a tight band Little Feat was.  Valerie Carter. A virtual unknown who released a couple of dynamite albums in the late \u201970s that passed under the radar. \u201cA Stone\u2019s Throw Away\u201d (1977) is a forgotten gem. On it she\u2019s backed up by Little Feat and the White Brothers from Earth, Wind and Fire among others. This cover of \u201cOoh Child\u201d shows her in fine form. Coming out of the break she really lets loose. But she wouldn\u2019t play the industry games and so never got the recognition she deserved. Valerie recently passed on and it\u2019s a bit sad that few noted the event. We lost a truly excellent singer.  Jim Carroll. A lot of people liked the movie \u201cThe Basketball Diaries\u201d. But few of those who saw it know who Jim Carroll is, even though the movie was about him. In 1980 he and his band released \u201cCatholic Boy\u201d, a punk rock album with all the energy and angst of the genre, but with tight song construction and lyrics that weren\u2019t just angry, but literary. Carroll went on to become a sort of \u201cStreet Poet Laureate\u201d for New York City. \u201cPeople Who Died\u201d is a punk anthem few other songs in the genre could match.  ",
