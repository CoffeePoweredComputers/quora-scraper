            "answer_text": "Yes, it does. In the past, they have regularly taken an American tune, and altered it, added a new beat or slowed down the tempo, or just used one refrain and made the rest original. However, now, the music industry is more and more international and they are beginning to officially buy the rights for their songs. For Kal Ho Na Ho, they officially bought the rights to \u201cPretty Woman\u201d and for Ra.One, they officially bought the rights to \u201cStand By Me.\u201d The same thing is happening with scripts. There are still plenty of producers who do shot by shot remakes of American films, or are \u201cinspired\u201d by an American film (for instance, Airlift and Argo which I discuss in more detail here). But the rights to Knight and Day were officially purchased for the remake, Bang Bang. And the same director is now working on an official remake of the Rambo films. ",
