            "answer_text": "Since ages, music has been an important part of human life. Music or songs in your case are artworks. Artworks are made by the artists as a way of expressing emotions they couldn't express otherwise. When you listen to different kinds of songs, you feel those emotions. Some songs, you might not be able to relate to, while to others you would relate too much. Some particular songs are not sad or giving out a sad vibe, but you relate to that song so much that you get welled up. For an example when I listen to the song \u201cAe watan\" from the movie \u201cRaazi\u201d, I get welled up. That isn't sadness but the feeling of patriotism for my country. This can also mean that you are an emotionally mature person, who is capable of feeling for others. so next time when this happens to you, look closely, it might just be a fact that you are capable of connecting with the artists expression on an emotional level.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy do songs that aren\u2019t particularly \u201csad\u201d but make me cry when listening to them?\u201d I\u2019ve felt something similar while listening to certain songs. Even if I\u2019ve never heard the song before or have no real attachment to it, even if I think the lyrics are a bit basic, I\u2019m still brought close to tears because of the music itself. As I\u2019ve written about before, there are certain tactics that writers, particularly in movie scores and the CCM genre, use in order to make their music inherently emotional. Swelling dynamics, certain chord progressions, and that sweet sweet drop can bring even make almost anyone feel something about it. I call them tactics because they\u2019re used specifically to make you more attached to the song even if you\u2019re not really into it. That can bridge the gap between the indifferent and their message. They\u2019re essentially manufacturing emotion to get you to buy a movie or tithe, respectively. It\u2019s a bit low in my opinion, but everybody\u2019s got to eat I suppose. Anyway, I\u2019m not sure exactly what type of music you\u2019re referring to, but I hope this (and the other answers here) explain what you\u2019re feeling. ",
