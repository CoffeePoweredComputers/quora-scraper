            "answer_text": "There are many different approach if you are looking for fame. Refining your craft and constantly promoting yourself with your craft and performance is definitely more straightforward way but there's no guarantee and might take some time. Some would engage with more well-known figures constantly from local favorite to paid collaboration. Working as a crew is common in some fields/genres, having someone to support artistically definitely helps and more people mean more information that might be helpful. Making publicity stunt or doing literally anything to draw more traffic is somewhat common also. Instagram and other platform have quite a few. People posting less musical activity but more nudity, rant, and random stimulating contents to draw traffic to acquire fame and profit have been out there forever actually. Some might actually get into music industry more seriously once they acquire enough money and fame, but this practice will limit who you are as an artist and tag of attention seeker will be hard to remove.
