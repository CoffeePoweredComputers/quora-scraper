            "answer_text": "IQ measuring is still a quackery. Most so-called \u201cIQ tests\u201d measure your level of education, your general knowledge, your spatial vision instead of your intelligence. We don\u2019t even have an unimpeachable definition for intelligence. People who lack the interest to learn certain things will score as low on these tests as people who lack the ability to learn them. I know doctors and street-sweepers who love music and play an instrument, and I know qualified musicians, playing in a symphonic orchestra, who never liked music, and play it just because they are too lazy to learn any other trade. I know a \u201cformer\u201d musician who sold his instruments and became a taxi driver, and one who really learned something new and became an electrician. Thirty years ago I played for about a year in a Romanian Gypsy band. I was the only non-Gypsy among them, accepted because I taught them the basics of music notation, some even how to write their own names.Translation: the love of music an the desire to play is totally independent of our current definition of intelligence OR education. It\u2019s also independent of the color of your skin, hair or eyes, your height and width, sexual orientation or religion. And if you lack the ability to learn numbers and names (who cares about history, anyway?), your brain might even \u201ccompensate\u201d this with extraordinary musical talent. P.S. Talent is not enough. You still have to want AND do something (learn, practice, learn, practice and so on) to be able to play. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. Each person who learns an instrument will eventually find their niche where they fit right in. Admittedly many of the most accomplished players are highly intelligent, but for the rest of us, we can still derive much pleasure from learning and playing an instrument. A couple of things to bear in mind though: if a child is in fact mentally challenged (as opposed to just average intelligence) then finding the right teacher and the right instrument is very important. E.g. the child may have a strong sense of rhythm but a poorly developed sense of melody. Then trumpet would not be the best instrument. Drums would be a better fit. Also, watch for signs that the child is really not enjoying learning an instrument - there's no point in forcing something that isn't a good match. Thirdly, specialized individual music tuition is not music therapy. Music therapy is conducted by psychologists who use music as a tool to help people function better. Music lessons are conducted by musicians who use various instrumental teaching methods to help people play better. Regular practicing sharpens the brain, but lessons in and of themselves aren't any more stimulating than say, a Sodoku puzzle. ",

Using a hammer against one\u2019s head on the third beat, every other measure in 4/4 time won\u2019t help. Nor do any of the other drastic things suggested in The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201c(I Know) It\u2019s Only Rock and Roll\u201d (pen, knife in my heart, & etc.). You\u2019ve got to \u201clike it\u201d to play it and enjoy it more. I think there is something to be gained by parents\u2019/guardians\u2019 forcing the early introduction of an instrument upon a child of learning-age. It may pass a shared skill from generation to generation in the family. A duet by a parent and child sharing a piano bench can be fun, like the two playing a song on a couple guitars. Music also has been shown to help the brain develop in surprising ways that other learning doesn\u2019t. I know that that\u2019s not IQ, but it does help the brain grow. See some search results at this page: https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=music+brain+development&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart If guardians don\u2019t help or push when one is younger, but that younger one still thinks of music \u201c\u2026 I like it,\u201d then have at it. Take jobs, save your allowance, borrow an instrument from the band-class at school, place an ad seeking an unused instrument people might have in a closet or under a bed (help them \u201cdown-size\u201d), then take some lessons. Learn some theory that will apply to more than one instrument. Seek a music club where you can play a variety of styles. I hope you enjoy playing your instruments. ",

IQ is about solving silly little puzzles. It has little, if any relevance to daily reality. Music calls into play lots of different brain functions and has a very positive effect on general functioning. This is one reason Music Therapy is being developed more and more, for all sorts of conditions, including dementia and PTSD. Playing music can be a really joyful experience - in fact, if it isn\u2019t joyful for you, don\u2019t do it! I\u2019d recommend anybody to try. Tone deafness is a real thing but is a very, very rare physical condition. Anybody can do something, even if it\u2019s shake a tambourine or bang some hand drums. ",

What turned into a life saving coping skill came out a love in music. I sing and I play some guitar. I'm into Alternative rock and pretty much any rock genre. But, I've heard of a guy from Japan who's an autistic savant with an IQ of 50 who's a progidy in percussion. Anybody can be musically inclined in my opinion it's just up to you the individual to try it. For some it will work others it won't. But I'm going to be attending hopefully a music apprenticeship next year. I hope I get in because music is a big part of my life and I've grown up in a house where it's not looked good upon to get involved with it, but I say screw it. Anyways, have a nice one. ",
