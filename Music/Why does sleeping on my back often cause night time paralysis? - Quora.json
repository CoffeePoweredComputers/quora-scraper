            "answer_text": "The reason for that is because, when you sleep on your back, you are in a more \u201chelpless\u201d position, with the front of your body exposed to any potential attack; so your dreaming brain might dream up a scenario where a malicious entity was holding you down against the bed. This would only happen if you were already prone to sleep paralysis. I used to suffer from very frightening sleep paralysis attacks. This happened sometimes even when my husband was lying right beside me, turned away from me, sleeping soundly. It happened once in the early hours of the morning, while it was getting light outside. I was lying on my side that time. I still sleep on my back but I sleep well propped-up with two pillows, in a half sitting position. Lying too flat makes me feel too helpless. I also wear a cross to bed and have a small seraphin angel on the wall above the bed, plus a small Italian icon of Jesus and Mary next to the bed. All of these things can help to keep those bad hallucinatory SP nightmares away. If you are not religious, good luck to you, if you suffer from SP. Try a bunch of lavender near the bed to invoke pleasant summery dreams; try healing crystals such as rose quartz, clear quartz\u2026 try soothing New Age music; and do not lie too flat in bed. Give up watching supernatural horror films, above all else. They feed the darkness that puts the SP demon into your dreams. ",

            "answer_text": "Sleep paralysis usually happens when you are suddenly woken from REM sleep. It has nothing to do with being on your back, though. As for why it happens? When you enter R.E.M. Sleep, you begin dreaming, and your brain releases a hormone to paralyse you to prevent you from acting out your dreams. This is supposed to happen but if you are woken suddenly from R.E.M. sleep, this hormone does not always stop bejng produced quickly enough, leading to sleep paralysis. It is harmless, though I\u2019m told that it can be scary, especially since you can hallucinate while having sleep paralysis. ",
