            "answer_text": "Richard Wright always sung the vocal for Time live, going right back to when they were performing it in 1972. Sometimes he would sing behind Dave Gilmour on the Versus and then take over for the choruses. The experience edition of Dark Side of the Moon has a live concert included and you can clearly hear Richard sing on time. In fact he sings a slightly altered lyric to the first chorus. Instead of \u201cTired of lying in the sunshine\u2026\u201d He sings, \u201cLying supine in the sunshine\u2026\u201d Richard was so loved for his vocal parts on Time that when he played live with Gilmour, the crowd would cheer when he did his parts. It is true to say that Richard\u2019s vocals diminished on the albums after Dark Side of the Moon. He\u2019s not on Animals or The Wall and was out of the band by The Final Cut and is only on the chorus on Shine on you Crazy Diamond. He doesn\u2019t do much on Momentary Lapse of Reason but he\u2019s making a great contribution in Division Bell. He did vocals live on the end of Dogs. I think what happened was that as Roger emerged as a lead singer, Rick naturally subsided because there still had to e room for Dave, and then Dave subsided too. Until Waters left that is. ",
