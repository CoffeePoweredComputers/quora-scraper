            "answer_text": "Spotify takes up the most market of the streaming music service. Spotify is a Swedish commercial music streaming, podcast, and video service that provides digital rights management-protected content from record labels and media companies. It is available in most of the Americas, Western Europe, and Oceania. Music can be browsed or searched by artist, album, genre, playlist, or record label. If you are Android users, Spotify is great for you. Apple Music is a music streaming service by Apple. Users select music to stream to their device on demand. The service includes the curated Internet radio station Beats 1 and the blog platform Connect for artists to share media with fans. Apple Music provides music recommendations based on user taste and is integrated with Siri voice commands. If you are iPhone users or other Apple device users, Apple Music is ideal for you.

            "answer_text": "I see streaming services like tv channels: they all have good and bad points. I registered to a few because I like to have options. Soundcloud is amazing for unreleased music, getting closer to artists, hear underground podcasts from Meditation to politics. Therefore, I registered to Spotify, Soundcloud, Google Play so far. I\u2019m not too much into Apple Music but heard good things. I\u2019d highly recommend you look into Bandcamp which is amazing for one thing, you can directly be in touch with artists, labels and buy merchandise too. ",
