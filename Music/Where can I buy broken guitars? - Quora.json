            "answer_text": "Facebook marketplace. They have tons of cheap dogshit people are trying to unload. Every once in a while you will find a gem, just in a condition that needs some work. I bought an SG for 450 and re-trussed the neck and set the intonation on the bridge and now its worth at least 1000 bucks. Good luck sifting through the turd pile but if you are patient its well worth it with some really nice payoffs every once in a while. ",

            "answer_text": "Broken guitars can sometimes be found at thrift stores such as Goodwill or Savers. Also if you go to a music store that sells used guitars and asked specifically for parts or broken guitars they may sell them to you very cheaply. Of course you can search Craigslist and find used or broken guitars. ",
