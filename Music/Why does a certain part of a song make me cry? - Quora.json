            "answer_text": "Because your heart connects with it. That particular moment speaks to you and you relate to it. Maybe it reminds you of an emotional time you went through, maybe the instrumentation or singing makes you emotional. My favourite song is Parisienne Walkways by Gary Moore and Philip Lynott. The lyrics describe a love affair in Paris and the instrumentation creates emotion and lead guitar are played with such feel. I\u2019ve never had a love affair in Paris, but for some reason the thought of it and the nostalgia you can hear in the song strikes a chord (eyyy) with me. Also, I appreciate the musicianship and talent that has gone into every millisecond of the music in this song, which makes me emotional. At the end of the day, dont worry about why\u2026 Just enjoy it and if it makes you cry, go for it. :) Imagine never feeling anything when you listen to music\u2026 That\u2019d suck. ",
