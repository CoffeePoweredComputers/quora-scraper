            "answer_text": "You kids are too young to remember this, but back in the 1970\u2019s there was this joke that made the rounds: \u201cI heard this kid say the other day, \u2018Hey, did you know that Paul McCartney was in a group before Wings?\u2019\u201d Nine #1 hits after the Beatles, two big hits with Michael Jackson, one on the best selling album of all time\u2026. Edit: I'm going to re-word this in a way that is less confusing. Once upon a time, there was this group called the Beatles. There were four members, John, Paul, George and Ringo. They were famous the whole world over. Everybody knew their names. ALL their names. All four were equally famous, in the sense that there wasn't anybody who knew who John was but didn't know who Ringo was, or knew who Paul was but didn't know who George was. They were like Eeny, Meeny, Miny, and Moe. They were a complete set. Then, in 1970 or so, they broke up. As years passed, more people in the world got born, and the percentage of people in the world who knew who \"the Beatles\" were shrunk. Each of the former Beatles carried on with their lives, and each earned themselves varying degrees of fame based on their individual accomplishments. It was no longer the case that something that Paul did made John equally famous, and vice-versa. Each of the achievements of each one served to increase their own individual fame. I don't think there is any realistic argument about which Beatle was the most famous as of December 7th, 1980. Paul's solo career was vastly more successful than John's. Paul had more hit songs, including what was at the time the biggest selling song in the history of the U.K., \"Mull of Kintyre\". He had made headlines around the world as a result of going to jail for 10 days in Japan for possession of marijuana. He had toured extensively throughout the decade with his band, Wings. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on multiple occasions. John did none of those things. Then, December 8, 1980, John Lennon was murdered. One could convincingly argue that, following his death, John was more famous than Paul. That was 38 years ago. More than five billion - BILLION - people have been born since John's death. In those 38 years, Paul has continued making records. He has continued to have hits, including #1 hits with both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. One of his duets with Michael Jackson, \"The Girl is Mine\", appears on Jackson's album \"Thriller\", the best selling album of all-time, and which sold millions of copies following Jackson's death in 2009. Paul has continued performing live, touring, appearing on television, and played the halftime show at a Super Bowl, watched by over 100,000,000 people. He closed the opening ceremonies for the Olympic Games in 2012, again an event watched by a hundred million people in countries all over the world. John... well, John has remained dead. There are very few people out there who have heard of John Lennon but not Paul McCartney. There are tens of millions who have heard of Paul but not John. Paul is, far and away, the most famous of the Beatles ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough question because it really depends on during what time period you are referring to. Though you can make a strong case for Paul. Back in the 60\u2019s everyone had their favorite but it was probably John with Paul being a close second. That did change some by 69 though and Paul may have been slightly ahead. When the album and song Imagine came out then John moved ahead a little. Into the 70\u2019s it was definitely Paul as he was in the public eye the most and along with Wings made some fantastic music. By 1975 John ready to take a break not only from music but from life in general and was quiet for the next 5 years while Paul and the others toured and put out albums. December 8, 1980 John became the most famous when he was shot and killed. He had just released Double Fantasy and truthfully it wasn\u2019t doing all that well until after he was murdered and suddenly everyone had to have the album. Fast forward a few years and once again Paul was the most famous. George had the spotlight when he died of course but that is to be expected. George was right up there a few times during his career but I can\u2019t honestly say that George or Ringo were ever as famous as John or Paul and certainly John has been written about more than the others but not always for the right reasons. Currently Paul is without a doubt the most famous of the Beatles and has fans aging from 9\u201390 years old. He has achieved more in his career than any of the other Beatles and is probably the most loved. well into his 70\u2019s he still tours and plays to sold out crowds wherever he goes. He has introduced the music of the Beatles as well as his own songs to new generations of people who become fans. Of all of the Beatles I think I can safely say he Paul is the most beloved. ",
