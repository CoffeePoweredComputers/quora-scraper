            "answer_text": "I like both Elton John\u2019s and Billy Joel\u2019s music. They are both great singers (or at least Elton John used to be), but I think Joel is the better singer overall (just my opinion). As a pianist, I would have to say Elton John is a better musician. Even Billy Joel admits he\u2019s a better organ player than pianist, and as one person put it comparing the two instruments, \u201cPiano acts as an introducer and a leader in a composition, whereas an organ works more as a follower than a leader\u201d(Koshal, 2011), which brings me to my next and more important point\u2026 Both are also great songwriters, but contrary to popular belief, both had a lot of help along the way despite the names that appear on their Albums and the marquees. Most people know lyricist Bernie Taupin was/is a long-time collaborator of Elton John\u2019s, but Billy Joel\u2019s band in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s put him on the map (and kept him there when his label was going to dump him). Musicians like the late Doug Stegmeyer (bass player), Liberty DeVitto (his drummer of 30+ years) et al who helped arrange Billy Joel\u2019s songs. According to other studio musicians, Devitto in particular had a knack for elevating mediocre songs Joel came up with to greater heights. Even some of his most iconic hits like \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d were highly influenced\u2014and made considerably better\u2014by the drummer. As Kenny Aronoff put it (drummer for John Mellencamp et al.), Liberty DeVitto was \u201cone of those guys who made the band he was in. Billy Joel sounded like Billy Joel because of Liberty DeVitto\u2014the \u2018Keith Richards\u2019 of that band.\u201d Similarly, what would Elton John\u2019s songs be like without Bernie Taupin\u2019s lyrics? So Billy Joel and Elton John are both as similar as they are different in a lot of ways. They also both have their strengths and weaknesses (like Billy Joel throwing his loyal bandmates and friends out like they were trash from time to time). Interestingly enough, despite touring together in the past, Elton John and Billy Joel are allegedly bitter rivals since 2010 or so (at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve read). That said, their music will likely outlive us all, and that\u2019s also a testament to the musicians that helped them along the way (and I hope they don\u2019t completely forget that). So who is better really comes down to personal taste. I tend to favor Billy Joel, but that doesn\u2019t make me right. It\u2019s hard to pick between Rocket Man and Just the Way You Are. But if you\u2019re going to hold my feet to the fire, I\u2019m going to say ABBA. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Better at what? If you mean better as an artist it\u2019s down to personal taste. I\u2019m not a huge fan of either, although I have several albums of both. I would generally say I preferred Billy, as I think his songs resonate with me more. As a pianist Elton is better. He was a session musician before he was famous. As a singer Billy has a better voice now, Eltons having been rather wrecked in the 70s. As a song writer Elton has co-written more and more of these have been hits. However, he doesn\u2019t write on his own, he nearly always uses a lyricist (mostly Bernie Taupin), except, from memory, Song for Guy, which is almost entirely instrumental. Billy writes lyrics as well as music, and certainly We Didn\u2019t Start The Fire is one of the cleverest lyrics ever. ",
