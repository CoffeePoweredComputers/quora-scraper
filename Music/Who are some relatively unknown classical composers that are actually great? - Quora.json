            "answer_text": "I have read the other 6 answers to this question. It is possible that there exists music written by a genius on the level of Bach or Mozart, which has never been seen or played, or discovered, by anyone. If so, that is very sad. However, really good music tends to get noticed and played, and once it has been played it will not remain in obscurity if it is great. A large majority of classical music lovers focus all their attention on a very small group of western composers spanning the last 4 centuries, that is true. However, I can assure you that composers such as Janacek, Rameau, Scarlatti, Telemann, Dittersdorf and Bruckner are very well known and played often by orchestras around the world. Possibly with the exception of Dittersdorf, who I am very familiar with because I play viola, all the composers mentioned are part of the mainstream of western classical music performance here and now. IMHO with the exception of Dittersdorf and Bruckner, the composers mentioned are first rate. If you want exposure to a wide variety of excellent music from medieval to the present, tune in to KUSC or WRQR and listen to those stations all day. You will see that the lesser known geniuses of the last 4 centuries are very well represented. ",

            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, but there many composers existing in the world that are as great (or better) as some of the greatest composers, but you will never hear about them. Part of \u201csuccess\u201d as a composer is good marketing and business skills (even in \u201cArt\u201d), and in fact, luck. There are thousands of incredible scores just sitting around that will never get heard nor played just because the particular composer is shy or not well connected or just plain unlucky. Since Art is a subjective thing, who is great to one person may not be to another. We tend to place most value on composers whom made the most \u201cimpact\u201d, which, of course, is certainly important. So if a composer is unknown and dies, it often lies with others to discover them. This is, in no way meant to discredit composers that are successful, in fact they deserve the credit for what IS the very hard work of getting yourself known, and they could not have that success without the merit. In the modern age, more and more people have access to education, and have the opportunity to study composition as intensely as what was once only possible for the privileged few. This combined with the ability to study music more deeply (we have recordings! And now the internet!) and technology (you don\u2019t need perfect ears or piano skills anymore since you can be assisted by a computer\u2014which doesn\u2019t take away from the merit since the quality of composition is the same!) has made a world where classical art music composers have multiplied to the extent much greater than ever in human history. That being said, there are so many composers now, many will never be well known, yes possibly not lost (not anymore at least, since the younger generations are all documenting themselves through the internet.)
