            "answer_text": "The Clash is my favorite band of all-time. You will never see a cooler, more stylistically, globally informative, diverse and highly skilled as them, who embraced so many various genres and produced such stellar music that its only fitting US and UK publications lauded them as \u201cthe only band that matters.\u201d But whereas the Clash navigated endlessly and tireless through the course of the map finding success through their exploration of rock music, the Beatles laid out the blueprints. They hit the waters first, understood the musical landscape and set sailed on a journey no other band was able to take\u2014not at that level. To be blunt, The Beatles set the foundation for other rock musicians to follow. Writing their own songs; playing their own instruments, resisting (as much as possible) to bring any one member anointed as the de-facto leader, creating an image, creating clothing trends, composing songs in different non-rock genres, composing music for other artists, fostering pop culture and finally producing songs that the World loved, the Beatles were what any band would want to aspire to in terms of accomplishment, credibility and mastery of music. I think its almost impossible to compare them with any band. Yes, there are a multitude of artists who had better musicians (The Clash included), could play with more complexity (although the Beatles are greatly underrated for their own) and speed. But no one had the sonic breadth of the Beatles. Not even bands such as Radiohead who gallantly broke all barriers down with KID A and continue to soar with other deconstructionism albums. No one had that gift of entering uncharted musical territories and making it sound brilliant. Subjectively, I prefer the Clash because of their leftist political disposition which brought attention to world oppression, struggles and dire straits during the late 70s and 80s. Their lyrics were seismic drops of reality during an era in which being delusional was popular and trendy as comical as that may sound. London Calling not only touched on English society, but brought attention to the nuclear arms race, the plight of recession and consumerism, which in all its dated time capsule still resonates today; and they did it under the umbrellas of fiery stellar melodic and pop punk bravado. Moreover, this is a band which put out a double-album (London Calling) then followed it up with a studio triple album (Sandanista!). The thought of a songwriter\u2019s mental block was unheard of with the Clash. But in all fairness and great respect to them, the Beatles in essence, were the better band. Almost 50 years later the Fab 4 are still being talked about; still being heralded and discovered by new generations of fans; still being listened too without any interruption, discourse or dissension as to why they are the greatest band in rock history.

            "answer_text": "Both bands are great bands who, notably had talent and made the most of it. They had several talented members, all of whom had distinct personalities and were stars in their own right; and whose talents just harmonized in a way that was far greater than the sum of their parts. The passionate articulate poet of the everyman and the underdog(Strummer), the tall guitar-slinging rock star/pop craftsman (Jones), the punk visual artist with the fashion-model looks,(Simonon) the rat punk junkie drummer (Headon); as opposed to the cynical poet(Lennon), the pretty-boy craftsman(McCartney), the hippie wizard (Harrison) and the ordinary joe(Starr.) I think both bands tried their very very hardest and fired on all cylinders pretty consistently. There\u2019s a certain positivity that both bands have in common and I don\u2019t think that either is better than the other. Both of them also covered quite an amazing amount of sonic ground in a bare few years (7 years or so for the Beatles, six for the Clash if you don\u2019t count Cut the Crap). They are equal. The Beatles sold more. (shrugs) ",
