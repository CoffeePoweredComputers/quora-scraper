            "answer_text": "Not sure if you mean the song or the album? You say song, but you\u2019re getting answers for the album! TSP (both song and album) are quite out of place within the doors catalogue, it\u2019s supposed to be, as the band are experimenting The TSP recordings were possibly the period of time that the doors were at their lowest. Morrison wasn\u2019t all that keen on being a rock star any more. Miami happened. Robby stepped up by providing a lot of songs (and even singing on Runnin Blue) and Morrison wasn\u2019t a fan of some of them (tell all the people for example) This lead to the doors listing separate writing credits for the first time as Morrison didn\u2019t want people thinking he\u2019d written Robby\u2019s songs (this is because he didn\u2019t like those songs, he had no problem with Robby\u2019s earlier songs, like love me two times) 4 people, who weren\u2019t getting along. Stuck in a studio for weeks with a perfectionist producer, trying a sound that they\u2019d never tried before. The end result (although not a terrible record and with some good tunes) was somewhat disjointed, musically at odds with their previous recordings. The title track was a Morrison number, but to many people (we are discussing taste here, so YMMV) didn\u2019t have the bite and intensity of their previous long numbers such as the end, or when the music\u2019s over and was created from Morrison\u2019s poetical notebooks rather than written as a complete piece. In my opinion this shows\u2026 YMMV TSP took 9 months to record. Jim had had to be talking into not quitting the band. The other 3 doors became resentful towards him and his alcoholism. Rothchild had a cocaine problem. It cost a lot of money to make. Many of the hip press that had so championed the doors early records gave it a bad review upon release. In many respects it\u2019s a very good album considering. But the turmoil surrounding its creation, combined with the need to create songs from scratch in the studio (the previous albums had all contained material that predates the band finding fame) just seems to lack (IMHO YMMV) the edge that had appeared on previous doors records. The following albums marked a return to form for the doors, but 1969 really was their annus horribilis ",
