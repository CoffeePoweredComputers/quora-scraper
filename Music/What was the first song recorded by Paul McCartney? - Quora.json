            "answer_text": "That\u2019ll Be The Day / In Spite Of All The DangerRecorded around July 1958 (believed on 12th July) by Quarrymen (The Beatles precursor) at Percy Phillips amateur home studio, in Liverpool. The session attended by Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, Collin Hanton, and John \u2018Duff\u2019 Lowe. That\u2019ll Be The Day [1] (side A) written by Buddy Holly and Jerry Allison. It was a hit and popular song during that time performed by Holly and his new band, the Crickets. Paul and co. made a cover version of this song for fun, as well as demo. In Spite Of All The Danger [2] (side B) is written primarily by Paul McCartney, and George written/played the guitar solo. Credited as Paul McCartney and George Harrison composition.  Both songs recorded at the same session, with only one copy of the original recordings was made. Each band member kept the acetate disc for a week. Paul :\u201cThe idea was that we keep it, each of us for a week. So I had it for a week, John had it for a week, George had it for a week, and\u2026 Duff had it for 23 years\u2026\u201d Paul referred to two of this song as the first song ever recorded by him and/or The Beatles. But mainly he refer to \u2018In Spite Of All The Danger\u2019, because this one also means as the first record of original composition written by him and/or by member of The Beatles, which probably hold more sentimental and historical value. The song was never made to public until Anthology 1 released on 1995, along with That\u2019ll Be The Day. Paul listed \u2018In Spite Of All The Danger\u2019 as part of his encore throughout his 2000\u2019s world tour, and continue to perform it live periodically afterwards. The earliest i can found on Youtube is from his concert at Madrid, 30th May 2004.  Go to 59:47 for the song. Here is video of him gave insight and storytelling about the record to the audience on \u2018Chaos and Creation At Abbey Road\u2019  Go to 17:31 for the story. Note :In 1981, \u2018Duff\u2019 Lowe attempted to sell the record at auction, but McCartney intervened and purchased it from him. McCartney had engineers restore as much of the record's sound quality as possible and then made approximately 50 copies of the single that he gave as personal gifts to family and friends. In 2004, Record Collector magazine named the original pressing the most valuable record in existence, estimating its worth at \u00a3100,000, with the 1981 copies made by McCartney coming in second on the list at \u00a310,000 each. Notable Mention : I Lost My Little GirlFirst song ever written by McCartney when he was 14 years old. Was never made public until McCartney performed it unplugged for MTV, the recording was released at 1991 on his album, Unplugged (The Official Bootleg). Live from MTV Unplugged  McCartney was one of the first in a long line of artists to release an unplugged album, and consequently helped MTV Unplugged [3] program into success and gained much more popularity.
