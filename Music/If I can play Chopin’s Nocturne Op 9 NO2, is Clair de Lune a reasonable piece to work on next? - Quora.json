            "answer_text": "Well, they are both highly recognized by even the most mainstream of listeners. They\u2019re both pieces that highlight the dynamic abilities of the instrument and the player\u2019s competence with controlling and their mastery over those dynamics. They both have a weave of rhythm and counterpoint where the timing of right and left hand parts can come together with subtle and emotionally moving expression. The delicacy of either can be breathtaking when performed well. When played incredibly well, they showcase the talents and skills of remarkably good pianists and allow those who are still striving to reach that level of mastery the ability to get through the piece with what many would still consider to be a solid journeyman performance. One of the key (pardon the pun) things I tend to notice is people who focus so much on the notes that they lose sight of how both are made more powerful by holding back with both their power and their sense of time\u2026. players who allow the music to stretch, breathe and not rush tend to give the more impressive performances (at least to me). As an example, compare Victor Borge\u2019s performance (which is excellent) to that of Kathia Buniatishvili and you may see what I mean. To me, her performance seems to almost form in the air and breathe with a life and emotion all its own. Neither is \u201cbad\u201d, not in the least. But there is clearly a lot of room in the composition where the pianist can express themselves and enrapture the listener.   ",
