            "answer_text": "It is impossible to objectively select the best drummer of all time. When it comes to the subgnere he is most famous for - prog metal- it is safe to say he is the most influential and quite possibly the most technically profficient of all drummers in that subgenre. But it is impossible to compare him to any of the great drummers in classic rock or jazz or any other genre. He is most certainly one of the most technically profficient drummers to have ever played, but best he is certainly not, as there is no such thing as the best drummer. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, Dream Theatre is cool. All them lenghty songs that last for minutes and good music led you to think of this. Sure, he is one the best drummers I have heard about but \u201camazing drummer\u201d is where it ends. Musicians are measured by their influences and how they could change music overall. No other drummer seems more deserving than John Bonham. Back in tge day when Led Zep was \u201cheavy metal\u201d Bonham was (and always will be) a staple of the grassroots of metal. Blastbeats? Started with Bonham. Unusual timings and patterns? 100% Bonham. Fast-paced fills and bass kicks? Bonzo\u2019s got it all. Its just like the \u201cJimmy Page or Jimmi Hendrix?\u201d debate. Page is good and an amazing guitarist but Hendrix made the guitar a more expressive instrument by inventing techniques. Still, the drummer you menrion is a very extrakrdinary drummer. .. ",
