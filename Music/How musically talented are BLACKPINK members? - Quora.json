            "answer_text": "I think they are musically talented at a high degree and have a unique sound and style to their music. Although they might be constant with this concept, it is not exactly a bad thing to continue this concept that they can be able to achieve well and show it in various ways. They have showed us different styles of music throughout their discography, with different beats, and melodies, but it can be sometimes redundant when they continue to stick to the same genre. Although I think they introduce some type of new genre such as Stay, which encapsulated a different mood overall, it felt that they were limited in musical range and they didn't have much musical style to offer, but the way they deliver the songs through their rap and singing is phenomenal and unparalleled to any other. It is the way they perform it with power and confidence that gives it the dimension and layer it needs to bring out the concept and mood of the song. They truly know what they can do and do it in a way that can attract a crowd through just their presence and the change in their aura, themes, backgrounds, and concepts. The colors they use ogive off a certain feeling and how they carry themselves throughout the music video gives them a badass and cool vibe. This is the algorithm and the formula for their group that keeps them rising in international stardom and it seems to be appeal to the audience, and serves them the right content that fans want and are pleased with. They can be able to perform in different musical ranges non terms of style and genre, but were never given the chance or leeway too, because the company usually make the songs for them sand monitors their work. It is not something they can contribute in but rather handed to them, regardless of their input and opinion. They are held at a standard and the way they can achieve and maintain that standard is if they keep releasing new content that they know people will love. In order to know how to appeal and compel the crowd, they have think about what would fans and filter into the minds of their fans and their needs and wants and expectations of the group. It might be different for everyone, but majority overrules the minority, so they usually take in consideration the majority and make the content based on that. Now, I am not saying Blackpink does not have the potential to do different things because clearly, they can. But I hope they are given more chance and opportunities to be able to show their potential and showcase new sides of them. But that is only my opinion and doesn't apply to what the company is allowing them to do, so my opinion wouldn't matter in this case. But I hope they would be able to experiment with new musical styles and allow the idols to do what they want in terms of music and have a say and input about it because they do have the potential to do so.
