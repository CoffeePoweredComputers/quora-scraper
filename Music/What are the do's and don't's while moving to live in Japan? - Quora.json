            "answer_text": "There is nothing called \u201cdo's and don't's\u201d while moving to live in Japan . It is the same as that of your country. For example, basically if you are from North America, Europe, Asia, Australia or some part of Africa. You need to be smart in doing things appropriately. All depends on you and the way you drive it. But do not tease people around you. If \" do's and don't's\" is related to your workplace, be sure to request the e-Learning materials to read it. I am not sure if such a material is viable at your workplace. Generally, it is not (if your work is related with restaurants and hotels, and similar others). And the e-learning kind of thing should be done right after signing the contract with the organization. Such a document will greatly help you to know the details of your work environment, policies and related other things (harassment of any kind and so on). Otherwise, you will be bullied by your boss over and again on any silly matter (typical in Japan, see here: Is bullying in Japanese schools common? and https://www.jil.go.jp/english/reports/documents/jilpt-reports/no.12_japan.pdf ). This is so as there are some who create a rule at an individual level and implement that on you. Then they say, it is a rule of the organization, although it does not really exist! As a foreigner, one should know the stuff given below: DO NOT DO Drunk bicycle riding is prohibited.Riding double on a bicycle is also prohibited in Japan. In Nagano (\u9577\u91ce), however, tandem bicycles are allowed.In some areas, it is also prohibited to ride a bicycle while carrying an umbrella during rainy seasons.Talking on the phone or listening to music while riding a bicycle is prohibited.If there is no sign indicating \u201criding side by side is permitted,\u201d you can\u2019t do so.Don\u2019t bring your bicycle on the train! You should park it at the train stations; unless you have a folding bicycle, you can bring it. Just make sure that you do not take the train during rush hours with your bicycle.Penalties You can get a maximum penalty of 50,000 yen (around 450 USD) and/or three months in prison if you ride a bicycle with broken brakes, or if you ride dangerously.For drunk riders, you can get a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a 1,000,000 yen (around 9,000 USD) fine.If you ride a bicycle while carrying an umbrella, you can face a fine of up to 50,000 yen. You can also get the same penalty if you ride while listening to music or talking on the phone.You can face a 20,000 yen (around 180 USD) fine if you ride a bicycle with a passenger (with the exception of a child below the age of 6).If you do not use headlights and rear lights at night, you can get a fine of up to 50,000 yen.Riding bicycles side by side can make you face a 20,000 yen fine.You can get a 50,000 yen fine for disobeying traffic lights.Also, see the following links:Bicycling in Japan \u2013 Know the Laws https://www.jitco.or.jp/download/data/leaflet_English.pdf Cycling in Japan: Basic Rules, Prohibitions, Penalties, and Safety Tips \u2013 Japan Info ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll add more as I think of it, but\u2026 DO: - learn how to separate your garbage properly. You will make friends easily with your neighbors if you do. It is annoying at first because there are SO MANY rules, but it is worth it (and good for the Earth, too!) DO: - learn some Japanese. Even if you only get to business level, it is important, not just for yourself and your own quality of life, but for safety purposes of yourself and those around you, too. DO: - be yourself. If you were hired for a job and that is why you are moving there, they hired you to be YOU. For your skills and for yourself. You will never be Japanese, so just be yourself (And that\u2019s a good thing!) DO: - understand the reason people don\u2019t eat in the streets is because of RESPECT for life. When people say \u201citadakimasu\u201d before they eat it is because they are giving respect for life. The verb \u201citadaku\u201d is a kind of \u201ctake\u201d and you are taking something\u2019s life when you eat (whether it be a carrot or a fish). So when you walk and eat, you are being disrespectful to life in people\u2019s eyes. So, eat and walk if you like, but understand that you are disrespecting other people\u2019s beliefs, so you have to decide how you feel about that. I\u2019ll edit as I think of more! ",
