            "answer_text": "I upvoted several answers here including Rose Swan, Diagnosed NPD. The answer is yes. The last NPD I dealt with was very critical of my wife and my wife\u2019s family. He said my wife\u2019s family were losers without jobs and too lazy to work. He said they just sit around and wait for wealthy people in the US to send money. He claimed that I said this myself about my father-in-law. But he didn\u2019t realize my father-in-law died 6 years before I ever met my wife. He didn\u2019t realize that all of my wife\u2019s family works hard and is very self sufficient. I found out later that he sends his wife\u2019s family a rather large sum of money every month and that his father gave most of what he had to a girlfriend instead of helping his own family. I found out that most of his wife\u2019s family sits around and waits for him to send money every month. I also heard that they they don\u2019t think much of him except for his money (according to his wife\u2019s own words). He told me my wife was very greedy and lazy and criticized her work ethic. He also said that she was mean over and over again and said that she has no real feelings and fakes being hurt so she can get sympathy. He also said she is a huge gossip. I guess I now know how he sees his own wife. 99% of the criticism from an NPD is projection or DARVO (Deny, Accuse, Reverse Victim Offender). They are experts at role reversal and acting as though you are the one with the problem and they are sane. ",

            "answer_text": "Are Narcissists critical of other people? One can think of Narcissism as a self-esteem regulation disorder in which the person has: An unstable sense of selfUnstable self-esteemA lack of empathy for other peopleThese three traits combine to create a situation that causes Narcissists to be unable to accept the blame when something goes wrong. If they did allow themselves to feel at fault, their self-esteem would dip, their sense of identity would shift into their seeing themselves as irredeemably flawed, and they would sink into a shame-based self hating depression. To avoid this, they shift the blame, and instead become extremely critical of other people. Their basic stance is: If something goes wrong, someone else must be blamed.When they feel unhappy about something, it is someone else\u2019s fault.Other people could be doing everything better.Elinor Greenberg, PhD, CGP In private practice in NYC and the author of the book: Borderline, Narcissistic, and Schizoid Adaptations: The Pursuit of Love, Admiration, and Safety. www.elinorgreenberg.com ",

They are two-faced in public to hide their criticisms but in private, YOU get the brunt of the criticism (and then get accused of not being able to handle criticism!)Narcs are hypocritical too. Their own rules don't apply to them.Being with a narc messes with your mind because their own minds are messed up. If my narc ever criticised himself, it was VERY short-lived before someone was getting the blame instead. ",

They criticize everybody and everyone, even themselves, although they would never say this out loud, and so they pretend - and to some extent even believe - that they have no issues and are the best. They are perfectionists. But generally, they expect more of you than they do of themselves. But then again, it depends how functional they are. The more functional person, the more they are critical with themselves, even though they don\u00b4t show it at all. ",
