            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mainly the keybed with velocity sensitive keys that makes them more expensive to make than a typing keyboard. All the keys on a modern MIDI controller keyboard are velocity sensitive, and this sensitivity needs to be as uniform as possible across all keys. Generally, the more expensive a MIDI keyboard, the more functionality it has, but also the better velocity response accuracy it has, which is important for musicians. Synthesizers are twice to five times as expensive as comparable* MIDI keyboards. Many synthesizers are also available without keyboard - a MIDI keyboard is needed to play them. *Cheaper synths also tend to have cheaper keybeds. ",

            "answer_text": "What is your price range? There are a few keyboards that come for cheap, for example the M-Audio keystation 49 comes usually for $99. Generally, the cost rises with the number of octaves and the other added functions on a keyboard. With 88 key hammer action keyboards, the price is likely to be higher, for example the Akai MPK 88 around $499 (on guitar center). There are a few cheaper ones like the M-Audio oxygen for below $300. A smart to do would be to look for cheap 2nd hand midi keyboards on ebay. You will find them on as low as $100. If you\u2019re lucky, you can even grab an 88 keyboard at a cheap rate, for example I once purchased an M-Audio keystation pro 88 at $150 which was super cheap. It had 8 faders, 24 knobs and a plethora of functions to control the DAW. All these prices are based on the US retailers. I don\u2019t know your location, but you should look on ebay for nearby dealers. Craigslist provides some good offers as well. ",
