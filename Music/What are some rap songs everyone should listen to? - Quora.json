            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been waiting years to answer this question. Here\u2019s the first song. As far as I\u2019m concerned this is the most perfect rap song I\u2019ve ever heard, and I\u2019m a fan. Don\u2019t fast forward, each verse builds on the other.  Fat Cats Bigga Fish Let\u2019s set aside the funky music which is great. The first two verses start as a perfect gangster/hustler rap song. But not on a stolen Bentley, all about the Benjamins level. Two highlights: Rapping about what a great criminal he is: \u201cI\u2019m a hustler for real, so y\u2019know I got the stolen bus pass.\u201dTalking about the wallet he just stole: \u201cDamn this motherfucka had hella Andrew Jacksons!\u201dIf every rap song was strictly these two verses I\u2019d be satisfied. Punchlines. Similes. Voice control. Attitude. I love this song so much I try to downplay it in fear that I\u2019m over selling it. But then he flips the third verse and it\u2019s lyrical and true and insane. Mr Coke said to Mr Mayor: \"you know, we got a process like Ice T's hairWe put up the funds for your election campaignAnd, oh, um, waiter can you bring the champagne?Our real estate firm says opportunity's arousingTo make some condos out of low-income housingImmediately, we need some media heatTo say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet!Harass and beat everybody til they look inebriatedWhen we buy the land, motherfuckas will appreciate itDon't worry about the Urban League or Jesse JacksonMy man that owns Marlboro donated a fat sum\"And he just told a poem in first person about gentrification in rhyme. He built up the biggest player in the hood to explain to you that it is absolutely nothing compared to the real moral crimes that occur over Cuban cigars and champagne. It doesn\u2019t matter what corners you cut or stakes you pull, the game is rigged. Here\u2019s the conversation of the people who rig it, in perfect syncopation. Did I mention I love this song? Every time that third verse pulls the rug out from under me. Cigarettes, the police force, the Urban League, the mayor, gentrification, they all work together, they all feed on each other. And you think you\u2019re a player because you\u2019re out here hustling hamburgers. Again, if every rap song was this song I\u2019d be okay with it. But there\u2019s a second song by Boots Riley that you need to hear as well.  Me and Jesus the Pimp in a \u201979 Granada Last Night Here\u2019s how you know Boots knows exactly what he\u2019s talking about. The last couplet of the first verse, \u201cAin't gonna mash too fast, cause my tags ain't right, Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night\u201d. If you truly are poor, your tax/safety is never updated. And you know any out of line driving, with bad tags it is not only an automatic ticket, but it is also automatic reasonable suspicion, a cop cannot get in trouble for pulling you over, once he sees you have bad tags. This is from experience right here, I\u2019m going to drive as legal as possible, because I know he can pull me over anyway, and I don\u2019t want to draw attention, because then who knows what he\u2019ll find in the car. I have one quibble with this song, he makes the moral explicit when he didn\u2019t need to. I think it is so obvious, making it explicit sort of shows distrust in the audience\u2019s ability to understand the message. I\u2019ve worked through it. This poetry is insane, the word paintings and the storytelling. Please listen to these songs. I really like them and like to share them with people looking for good hip hop. I also think everyone should listen to Po Pimp, by Do or Die. but I think people have heard that one. Boots is someone I think more people need to hear. ",
