            "answer_text": "Oh, this is interesting. Zeus - Bro rock. Gets wasted listening to Godsmack and Pantera, then tries to stick it into anything that moves. Aphrodite - Commercial pop or rap about anacondas. Ares - Hardcore. Always itching for a fight. Apollo - Avant-garde and jazz. The god of music is into bands you\u2019ve never even heard of, darling. Artemis - Punk. Because no one tells her what to do. Hephaestus - Industrial. Because he needs a good rhythm to pound metal to. Hermes - Chopper rap. The silver-tongued god of messengers and thieves has no time to waste. Hades - Blackgaze. A melancholic character who cares for the dead that inhabit his realm. Poseidon - Mykonos deep house. Island-life, baby! Demeter and Hestia - Folk. As the most earthly of deities, they\u2019re into acoustic guitars and fiddles, dancing with bare feet and big smiles. Athena - Post-rock. Because when you are the living embodiment of wisdom and strategy, you need something equally brainy. Bonus: Dionysus - EDM he can rave to with the satyrs and the nymphs. Offers E to everyone at the party. UPDATE: I forgot Hera, because of course. Hera listens to \u201cI Will Survive\u201d and \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d on repeat while crying herself to sleep. ",
