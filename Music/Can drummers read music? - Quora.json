            "answer_text": "Some do, some don\u2019t. That\u2019s the short answer. It\u2019s not necessary to read music if you play in a band with fairly predictable style of music and there is a general understanding when you play an accompanying role and when you can take a more solo position, if you have a good inner sense of rhythm. In those cases there is an inner sense of direction and the music has a kind of improvisatory flexibility that does not depend on following a score. Playing in an orchestra where the composer has carefully orchestrated exactly what everyone plays, and when, is totally different. That requires great skill in following the printed part, counting lots of empty measures and being able to come in at the exact moment required by the score. Of course there are not the melodic notes played by other acoustic instruments, but the style and degree of loudness and how your percussion part fits in to the overall sound is specified in the music. If you watch a percussion player in a symphony orchestra he or she may have a dozen or more sets of sticks, some hard and sharp, others softer and booming, to create different sounds and those may be specified by the conductor. Being a good music reader would only be the most elementary entry-level skill to become such a musician. ",

That\u2019s sort of a cross between a drum \u201ctab\u201d where the individual drums are notated, with standard notation that indicates the rhythm. Many drummers read this well and can exactly replicate drum parts from this notation. And some drummers (believe it or not. .. I know its hard to believe) actually play OTHER INSTRUMENTS, and can read music for those instruments and/or in general. Drummer in my band was actually a highly skilled jazz saxophonist, and could play a little piano. That guy can could read! ",

If I show them a new song they just follow along and we come up with something. I know there's a right way to write songs but I've always been happy with what the guys come up with and my drummer is like a brother to me we all sync well. You'd have to ask a real drummer about reading music for drums but to me it looks like chicken scratches. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, drummers read music at least for percussion. Many drummers have learned to play the drums by learning from other drummers. Other drummers might take classes or use mentors to learn percussion. Professional drummers usually have an academic background in percussion. Percussionists have two basic mediums for reading and writing percussion scores. One type uses a single note rhythm line to indicate the timing and dynamics of composition. Another avenue is to use a percussion scoring staff so a drummer can notate the position of the rhythm lines with indications for the different percussion instruments, cymbals, high hats, snare, tom-tom, and bass drums. The bottom line is that drummers, like guitarists, can be self-taught or they may have academic experience. It\u2019s all good music! ",

If they have classical musical training (which I highly recommend), it\u2019s almost certain that they can read music. ",

That\u2019s the rhythm part of reading music. Since drums ( other than timpani ) don't have notes, that part of music notation may tell the drummer what drum to play on ( eg. small Tom, floor Tom, ride cymbal etc.). So most drummers who have taken lessons have good skill reading rhythms and body coordinations. All genres of orchestra and studio professional drummers need to be very good sight readers. ",

Many years ago I practiced by sight-reading off of a page, and got somewhat decent at playing drum patterns at speed. More often I am trying to figure out music notes from sheet music to play keyboards. I can do it eventually, but not fast enough to sight-read. Right now I am slowly, one note at a time figuring out Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Russian Easter Festival Overture, about 7/8 complete. So I can read music and all those funny symbols on there, but if you are looking to plop a score down in front of me and say \u201cplay\u201d, all you\u2019ll hear is silence. Because drumming is such a feel it thing that many can do without much training, I expect you will find that most drummers that are not trained will not know how to read music. Few would want to do all the hard work when they could play most popular music styles without the effort. Why bother? Still, I think it\u2019s work that will pay off, that\u2019s why I try. ",
