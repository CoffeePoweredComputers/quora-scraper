            "answer_text": "Probably. And perhaps George was hard on Paul at times. It\u2019s well to remember that many of the noteworthy but private moments that went on between the Beatles have stayed exactly that. Private. We have to infer what went on from remarks here and there in interviews. I think it was George himself who said in relation to his difficulties with Paul that it was he that was in the back of a Limo with John and Paul, not other people. By that he means, things were said that were harsher than known to the general public. The rift between the two is simple enough. George wanted more creative input and support. I don\u2019t think Paul had an issue with George writing songs per se, but he wanted to make sure they were high quality. Possibly he resisted George\u2019s attempts at songwriting with passive aggression or lack of moral support in the early days. Very possibly he may have said, \u2018Don\u2019t fuck up the good thing we\u2019ve got going here, we\u2019re the songswriters,\u2019 (maybe even in the back of a Limo). The trouble is, George rated his songs higher than Paul did and probably higher than the public did. A case in point, on the Anthology series George stated that he thought his songs on Revolver matched anything else on it yet (for what populism is worth) few would agree that Love You To or I Want To Tell You come anywhere close to matching Eleanor Rigby or any of Paul\u2019s iconic efforts; though it must be noted that George contributed the essential \u2018all the lonely people\u2019 lyric idea. In my view, if George really wanted to make a case for equal billing with John and Paul the average of two he was writing for Beatles albums should have been two really strong numbers. They tended to be hit and miss and only on their remarkable swan song, Abbey Road, do I think he delivered two tracks matching Lennon and McCartney at their best. Could Paul have helped George more? Probably, Paul is well known for being overbearing and the lack of encouragement must have been disheartening, to put it mildly. But curiously, if you listen to George\u2019s songs it always seems to be Paul who is doing the most to help them along, usually by adding intricate and compelling basslines (doesn\u2019t the melodic bassline on It\u2019s Only A Northern Song all but make the song?) and singing harmony with discernable enthusiasm. Showing off, helping George, or helping the Beatles brand? No 3 for sure, we can speculate about nos 1 and 2. (Off the top of my head I know John helped with lyrics on Piggies and Taxman). If one asks could Paul have gone further than simply being an outstanding session musician on George\u2019s songs and been a friendlier, more helpful and nourishing advocate for George the songwriter the broad consensus appears to be \u2018yes\u2019 but such an answer often carries a simple assumption that that would have automatically translated to a better outcome in terms of quality and quantity. Judging from scant remarks it seems that neither John nor Paul wanted to encourage delusions of grandeur but at least on occasion when Paul saw potential in George he was in fact very supportive, such as in the case of the Inner Light, a song which he thought had a beautiful melody and George felt he couldn\u2019t do justice to. Otherwise, it isn\u2019t easy to identify other times in which Paul might have been forthcoming because the reactions of John and Paul on a song by song by basis are largely unrecorded and something of a mystery. Judging by George\u2019s bitter sense of abandonment John and Paul must have given him nothing more than token support but for all of George\u2019s resentment there is every reason to believe it was Paul and John that pushed George to up his game, even if through neglect. At present there is quite a vocal presence of fans on YouTube leaving comments about how criminally undervalued George was but I suspect the majority of those \u2018fans\u2019 probably don\u2019t know George\u2019s music very well beyond All Things Must Pass. In other words, they\u2019re not putting their money where their mouth is. The fact is the longer George was separated from the quality controlling influence of John and Paul the worse an effect it seemed to have on his output, which declined dramatically in quality as the 70s went on. Admittedly, he came back fighting fit in the late 80s (Cloud Nine, Wilbury\u2019s) but he was a maturer artist who had learnt a bit about commercial realities after a chastening period in which he used up a lot of good will. On the other hand, it\u2019s perhaps reasonable to argue that George wasn\u2019t given enough encouragement at key points in his journey as a songwriter. George Martin is on record as saying that George\u2019s early efforts were poor, but in fact this is a George Martin error and simply isn\u2019t the case. I Need You is an early gem about which very little is said even today. In fact it\u2019s so catchy I could happily accept it as a Lennon and McCartney throwaway written for George. It richly deserves its place on the stronger side of the album of songs included in the motion picture and is not bad at all for a second effort. Likewise, when I hear the demo of Circles I wonder why it didn\u2019t end up on the White Album. I\u2019d take it any day over a couple of Paul\u2019s more irritating songs on that disc. George didn\u2019t just want more songs, he wanted more input into the arrangements of Paul\u2019s songs and this was a sore point between them. He got his own back by criticising Paul\u2019s bass playing on Something but it\u2019s arguably the best bass line in the catalogue, so George was apparently settling a score. (Paul later responded with a sly dig at the style of lead guitar on My Sweet Lord). George obviously had an ego and I think he thought that he deserved an unfairly suppressed musical role equal to John and Paul whilst ironically being instrumental in getting Pete Best kicked out the group. The truth is everybody had an important and vital role to play but John and Paul were the engine behind the Beatles and there is just no way that we can honestly say that George carried the group as a composer or could have. What is more, without John and Paul he would never have had a unique chance to showcase his composing talent to a massive captive audience. On the outside it looks like George got a reasonable deal on the albums and probably would have got a better one had the Beatles stayed together. But on the inside, fighting to get his songs heard or treated seriously and being told how to play his solos (and what to play, sometimes) would have been understandably grating whether or not such treatment was warranted. It was certainly a factor in their demise as a group. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes is the answer. While John Lennon would allow Harrison to weave guitar hooks into his compositions, McCartney would sometime remove Harrison's solos on such songs such as \u201cAnother Girl\", \u201cPenny Lane\" and \u201cHello, Goodbye\".  During The Beatles years, when Harrison started to assert himself musically, he chafed at what he saw as McCartney's dictatorial direction. In The Beatles Anthology, he recalled: \u201cThere came a time when Paul (McCartney) had fixed an idea in his brain as to how to record one of his songs\u2026It was taken to the most ridiculous situation, where I'd open my guitar case and he'd say, 'No, no, we're not doing that yet.'\u2026It got so there was very little thing to do, other than sit around and hear him going, 'Fixing a hole\u2026' with Ringo doing the time.\u201d It had gotten to the point where Paul was telling him how to play his instrument and we all heard him say in the \u201cLet it Be\u201d film: \u201cI'll play what you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to. Whatever it is that'll please you, I'll do it.\u201d And it had gotten to the point where he wanted to leave the biggest band in the world and move on. He had actually walked out of a recording session but was prevailed upon later. In the post-Beatles years, in a Press Conference for his 1974 tour he said, \u201cI'd join a band with John Lennon any day, but I couldn't join a band with Paul McCartney, but it's nothing personal. It's just from a musical point of view.\u201d Was it not really personal? Maybe. But I think if you're an artist trying to express your art and somebody tried to suppress it, you'd have a personal grudge on that somebody. Artists are sensitive people. And how about Paul, was the reason personal why he was hard on George whom he said he considered his little brother? Or was it because of this - a case of elder brother being hard on his younger sibling? I don't think so, he had not targeted him. For Paul, a driven and passionate man, was not only hard on Harrison but equally hard on everybody, including himself. In the book \u201cStill the Greatest; The Essential of the Beatles Solo Careers\" it was written that throughout the Seventies, guitarists for Wings would quit after realizing that they would have almost zero input on what they played on or did not play, which is fine; McCartney's a musical genius and should be able to hire those who will do what he wanted done. And I think there it was, the operative word - genius. They say that geniuses are hard to work with because they hear voices in their head and they'd rather listen to those voices than to people around them. So McCartney could not help himself but be himself. He would not listen to Harrison, he himself told in a video interview that he rejected Harrison guitar work for ''Hey Jude' because \u201cthat's my song.\u201d But Harrison must have his say, for he was not a session guitarist being paid by the hour. He was a Beatle, and an emerging musical giant at that, especially in the late 60s. And so there was the problem. As Harrison himself complained that there seemed to be no more room for a contribution from him because 'Paul had fixed an idea in his brain how his songs must be recorded.' Meanwhile, at that time, he personified what French Poet Victor Hugo described as an idea whose time has come. Something that must be given way for it's hard to stop. And this became obvious when right after The Beatles broke up, his solo recordings were the biggest hits and outselling Paul's. Thank you. ",
