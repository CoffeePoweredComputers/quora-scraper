            "answer_text": "There are two types of conferences in my opinion, breadth and depth. SXSW Interactive is all about breadth. It's mission is to turn you on to things that you might have little access to or emerging ideas that you might be somewhat interested in but maybe need to understand a bit more. I would highly recommend that you pick content sessions based on not only your passions and current role but maybe 2-3 that are totally out of your skill set to pick up new things to incorporate into your every day professional or personal life. I like the site http://lanyrd.com/ - while SXSW's site is good it was nice to be able to sync up my contacts from twitter to look for speakers and content that was relevant to me and the peer group I follow. Beyond the actual official sessions, the meetups and 'parties' are great for meeting people from a wide variety of organizations. Register for a lot of the parties ahead of time on plancast or eventbrite. This way you will have options. I also found that getting to know people in the lobby of the hotel I was staying at was helpful to find sessions that I might not have originally considered. Bring comfortable shoes, in fact maybe a few par, bring plenty of water. As for technology - bring your smart phone (with extra battery or quick charger) and a notepad. I found that carrying around an ipad was pointless so going low tech is better in my option. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest going to events that aren't obvious and in your existing knowledge area.  Some of the real opportunity is to be exposed to all of these people from walks of life that are NOT your own.  Last year, I got to hear about ARGs in public art and interactivity in documentaries -- not my normal bucket of experience.   I'd also suggest taking lots of vitamins and getting lots of sleep before you go...too much to do and not enough waking hours... ",
