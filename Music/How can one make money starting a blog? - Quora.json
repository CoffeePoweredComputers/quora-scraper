            "answer_text": "Great question! I have a simple answer, and it\u2019s not a traditional one. There were many myths out there of what you need to do to get ahead in the blogging hemisphere:  Build a listGrow a followingWrite a lot of content...and so forth. I bought into many of them. But they weren't working for me. I hit a bottleneck. I wasn't getting ahead. Much like you, I was stuck, trying to figure out how I could really start to earn money with my blog.  Then one day, it all clicked.  I discovered how to utilize content in the right way to get ahead. Today, my business earns over $200,000/month with just one piece of content. Just one. Here\u2019s what I learned... Creating content first and then figuring out how to monetize it later is a bad idea and doesn\u2019t work for most people. A better strategy is solving a problem that customers are willing to pay for first and then creating content around that problem.  Here was the key. For months in 2013, all I did was: Zero in on the one problem we were solving.Search for customers with that problem.Refine our advertising and content to speak only to that problem.I tested the messaging relentlessly until everything clicked. When it did, my business went from $10,000 per month to $200,000 per month in just one month and has stayed there ever since. As a result of the problem-first focus and testing, our sales process is extremely simple. We drive traffic to a single piece of content through advertising on Facebook and Twitter, and then invite anyone who's interested in working with us to reach out to a strategy session over the phone to see if we're a mutual \"fit\" for working together. Nearly 95 percent of our clientele have never heard of us before clicking on that first ad, and they make their initial purchase within 48 hours of the first click. None of this would be possible if we had followed the faulty assumptions of the content-first strategy... Faulty assumption No. 1: If you create content, people will consume it.  Source: Adapted from \"Content Shock: Why Content Marketing Is Not a Sustainable Strategy\" The amount of content we all collectively create every year is increasing exponentially, yet our attention spans remain the same. It means that the average blog post, podcast, or video is going to get fewer and fewer views. Bad news for the average content creator. That is, unless you create great content. Doing this successfully takes a huge amount of time, money, and energy. If you're busy pouring your heart and soul into your new business, those three things are in very short supply. It could take a year or two before you start seeing a sizable tribe (and that's only if you're sharing fantastic content on a regular basis). Chances are, you're either spending hours each week struggling to keep up with creating content (which the majority of marketers eventually hate doing) or you're outsourcing the content-related tasks and paying handsomely for it. Either way, you're spending a hell of a lot of time or money now for results that may or may not come years down the road! Faulty assumption No. 2: If you build a tribe, they will buy from you when you release a product. Imagine scaling a tribe for years before finally offering something to them, only to find out your sales aren't nearly what you'd expected. It happens all the time. Just because someone loves your content, it doesn't mean that the person needs your product, is able to afford it, or will choose your product over a better one. You do not want to end up two years down the road, 100,000 tribe members later, with only a handful of sales. It's not worth your time or the risk. When do you want to know if your sales funnel works? Right now! A synthesis of 32 studies on trust and sales clearly shows that consumers would rather buy from a company that has expertise and can solve their problem, than from one they like. A global study of 6,000 sales reps from 100 companies by the Sales Executive Council found that sales reps who focus on relationship building comprise only 7 percent of top sales performers. Bottom line: Just because someone likes you, it doesn't mean he or she is going to buy from you. Instead of building an audience of people who might have your problem in the future, you should seek out the people who definitely have your problem today. Faulty assumption No. 3: Startups should put energy into turning browsers into buyers. The content-first approach implies that startups should target browsers: people who do not want to purchase your product right now, but may want to in the future. A much more reliable approach is targeting buyers who know exactly what problem they're facing, feel the pain of it, and want a solution now. If you treat buyers like browsers, they'll feel like you're wasting their time. When you walk into a car dealership, you don't want a keychain or a hat or a list of The 11 Best Songs to Listen to While Driving-you want a car. Instead of spending months (or years) trying to convert browsers into buyers, you should be laser-focused on buyers and give them what they want now. Faulty assumption No. 4: People won't buy unless you've invested a great deal of time in the relationship. It is an ugly myth that you need to build a relationship with people over months to sell them a product, even a high-priced one. Research shows that 75 percent of online shoppers buy within one hour of being on the site, with 45 percent deciding to purchase in less than 15 minutes. This is no less true for B2B companies that have longer sales cycles: A 2012 MarketingSherpa study shows that 49 percent of B2B sales close in less than three months. Bottom line: When we have a painful problem and are looking for a solution, we prefer to move fast. Seth Godin predicted that permission marketing would replace advertising. It hasn't. The unofficial father of the content-first approach is Seth Godin. His 1999 best-selling book, Permission Marketing, predicted that advertising would be replaced by permission marketing: \"Rather than simply interrupting a television show with a commercial, or barging into the consumer's life with an unannounced phone call or letter, tomorrow's marketer will first try to gain the consumer's consent to participate in the selling process.\" True to Godin's prediction, 16 years later, the entire world of social media is based on the idea of \"following\" others. However, the other half of Godin's prediction hasn't come true. And it won't. Advertising is still the main way that businesses get customers, and it's becoming even more important. It's the main business model of many of the largest internet companies, including Google and Facebook. Last year, Google made a little over $59 billion on advertising alone, accounting for 89.5 percent of the company's revenue. My point? Startups don't need to spend years (or even months) building up permission before they start selling. Content is an effective strategy for companies with a proven product and money to throw around. But for the resource-strapped entrepreneur, it is a dangerous sinkhole. There is a much quicker, better path to your end goal. The problem-first approach Instead of creating 50 videos, blog posts, and podcasts, why not create one phenomenal piece of content that speaks directly to the problem that your client has today, and let that one piece of content do the selling for you? I call this the \"problem-first\" approach. Rather than focusing on creating mountains of content your audience may not need, focus like a laser on what they do need: a solution to their problem. It looks like this:  Bottom line: Not only will you save precious time and money with the problem-first approach, you'll also build a stronger tribe. Instead of your followers being a hodgepodge of lukewarm leads who \"enjoy your content,\" you will have a targeted group with the same exact problem who are committed to solving it, and who have been transformed by your product. Take action Ultimately, you need to ask yourself one question: \"Is it a tribe that I'm trying to build or a business?\" You can build all the tribe members you want, but if you aren't actively selling to them, you don't have a business. You have a following. If you want to build a business, start with the problem first: Discover what your market needs.Help customers identify their deepest frustrations, and understand their problems.Show them that you can get them out of those problems.Paint the picture of how that will transform their life.Ask them if they want help.That's where your No. 1 focus needs to be. Do all these things now. Not a year from now after you've built your tribe. (They may not even have the same problems then.) Not 8 months, or even 4 months from now. Right now. Why wait? People that have a serious-enough problem aren't looking to casually peruse your tribe-building content for eight months to get answers. Here's the ugly truth: If their problem is real and big enough, they want it fixed. If you give them great reading material but aren't fixing their big problem, they'll move on to someone who will. They don't need endless pieces of content. They need solutions. Your solutions. --  This Quora answer is a modified version of a guest post  I originally wrote for Inc. -- Russ Ruffino is the creator of Clients on Demand.

            "answer_text": "THE SPOKE AND WHEEL APPROACH TO HOW I MONETIZED MY BLOG TO MAKE MILLIONS AND YOU CAN TOO In 2009, I saved the planet. Plus I was fired from all of the various jobs I was doing and every business idea I had totally failed. I had no more opportunities left and I had nothing to lose. I felt if I died, nobody would care. I let loose. I started blogging and my life changed after that.  First: The Financial Times stopped printing my column. The Street stopped printing my articles, Forbes stopped printing them, and no book publisher would return my call. CNBC stopped having me on as a guest. And nobody ever wanted to meet me. I felt like my career was over. Every business idea I had turned to shit. Ideas were shitting out of my brain. I didn\u2019t have any friends. My books stopped selling. Five business ideas in a row failed. I wanted people to crowdsource ad campaigns for big brands (JungleSmash). I still think that was a good idea. But divorce got in the way and crying at random points during the day stopped that idea. A hedge fund idea blew up when I invested in Lehman Brothers the day before it declared bankruptcy. A dating site for Twitter (140Love) went against the idea that people cheating on their wives liked to be anonymous. I also made a dating site for smokers. That was a total failure!  I figured if people were advertising on Facebook maybe they would advertise on Twitter and I would set up an ad agency. The Chevy Volt wanted to hire me. \u201cJust come to Detroit!\u201d What? \u2014- Then I started to blog and almost immediately I saved the world. I didn\u2019t make a dime off of it. In 2009, when I walked outside my building, the New York Stock Exchange was right in front of me and an enormous statue of George Washington was to my right. He was inaugurated the first President of these United States right at that point. Every day depressed traders, traders looking down at their feet, traders whose hair grayed with every step, were walking into the exchange at 9:30 am when the worst months, the worst markets, of their lives would keep beating down on them. I\u2019m going to help them, I thought one day. I bought three bags of chocolates. They were small chocolates. Like Hershey\u2019s Kisses. Chocolate boosts oxytocin. Makes you happier. Makes you more hopeful for the future. Women get a big burst of oxytocin during labor. Supposedly it helps them deal with the pain but I think it helps them rationalize the 18 years of hard work and suffering they are about to endure as mothers, right when they have their kid\u2019s bloody heads going right through them. \u201cHere you go,\u201d I said to every trader walking right into the stock exchange. A woman looked up in surprise. \u201cChocolate,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said and took it. Another guy just took it without looking up. The guards squinted at me but giving chocolate away seems safe, although suspect. I am not kidding when I say that day, March 9, 2009, the stock market hit bottom and began to go up and up and up to this day, almost 11 years later. Oxytocin makes you more likely to take a risk. So you feel like raising a baby for 18 years. Traders began taking risks again. And the market keeps going up. But I still had no job, no opportunity, nothing. Nobody. I moved away. I wanted to be by myself. Or maybe I was really depressed and anxious. I was both. For the first time, I had nobody to write for. So I started to blog. If you blog, remember two things: UNIQUE: say something nobody else has ever said YOU: be vulnerable. Tell the truth. Tell a story. And I\u2019ll throw in a third thing. Study good writing. Study, read, read read, and then write. I read every morning Raymond Carver, Cheryl Strayed, Charles Bukowski, Denis Johnson, Celine, Amy Hempel, Miranda July, Sam Pink, Hunter S. Thompson, James Frey - everyone who disguised their own autobiograpihes with a flimsy coat of fiction. Everyone who I think are the greatest writers ever. And then I\u2019d write. I wrote about going broke and surviving. The first time and the fifth time and the third time. I wrote about Yasser Arafat investing in my second company and how I lost $100,000,000 of other peoples money. \u2014\u2014\u2014-  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 I wrote so much about suicide that if you googled \u201cI want to die\u201d I was the first result out of 600,000,000 possible results. I wrote about my biggest teachers being the enormous number of women who had rejected me. I wrote about begging Bernie Madoff to invest in my hedge fund and how he rejected me. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014   (no longer first but on first page). I wrote every day. From 2010 to today I wrote every day. Over 3000 articles. I didn\u2019t have a blog. I didn\u2019t have \u201cjamesaltucher.com\u201d. But about five or six years earlier, someone bought me \u201cjamesaltucher.com\u201d for my birthday. A reader of mine from my financial articles. I never returned his email from five years earlier so I hit reply and said, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll take it. Thanks!\u201d He wrote back right away, \u201cthat\u2019s the longest it\u2019s taken anyone to reply to me!\u201d And he still had the domaine name. Thank you! And now I had a blog and I put my articles there. I read Thom Jones, Matt Ridley, Charlotte Beck, Eckhart Tolle. I read Haruki Murakami, TC Boyle, Ariel Levy. I wrote about losing two homes and how nobody should ever buy a home. I wrote about getting kicked out of grad school and why college was a scam. I wrote about how no war in history was worth it. I wrote about going broke, going broke, failing, losing, addiction, everything. Yahoo Finance started asking me on and some of their videos with me would get millions of views and tens of thousands of comments. People told me, \u201cDon\u2019t read the comments\u201d but I would and then I\u2019d get depressed for a day. \u201cHow come they keep letting this homeless guy on Yahoo Finance\u201d is the type of comment I would get. I wrote about how I bounced back from going broke. I wrote about the people who inspired me and why and how they changed my life. I read Chuck Pahlaniuk. I read James Baldwin. Richard Wright. I read Ramana Maharshi and Paul Bowles and Mohammed Mrabet. I started putting my articles on different websites. I\u2019d write on Facebook. LinkedIn. Entrepreneur sites like TechCrunch. A yoga site: The Elephant Journal. A millenial site: Thought Catalog. A self-help site: Positively Positive. A dozen other sites. I wanted people to feel, wherever they looked, there I\u2019d be. I wrote for Cracked.com, I wrote for a popular men\u2019s site. I wrote for a popular literary site. And on and on. I wasn\u2019t making a dime. One investment of mine from 2007 finally came through in 2012 so I had some money to live. I was getting on more TV shows about my different opinions. I started a podcast and it was ranked #1 in the world the week it was launched. I self-published a book, \u201cChoose Yourself\u201d and it sold a lot of copies. I promised everyone who bought that book they could get their money back if they proved to me they read the book. In the first month I gave about 600 people their money back. 600 people out of 60,000 who had bought it that first month and people have been buying ever since.  I still wasn\u2019t really making money. The book was ok but I had hired a book designer, a marketing company, three editors, an audio book production company, and a company to make a trailer. I wanted to do what I called \u201cprofessional self-publishing\u201d. But I was building an audience. I was going a Twitter Q&A once a week (which resulted a book, \u201cFaq Me\u201d). And I was posting a lot on LinkedIn. In 2015, LinkedIn made me their #4 top influencer. Behind Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and I forget the other one. My social media presence was filling out. People were enjoying and maybe even being helped by \u201cChoose Yourself\u201d. I felt fulfilled. Ramit Sethi, author of \u201cI Will Teach You To Be Rich\u201d encouraged me to start an email list. He said, \u201cYou have to do it!\u201d At first I got 10,000 subscribers. Then 100,000. Then many more. I put each article I wrote on the list. I started another podcast, then another podcast. \u201cHow do you have the time?\u201d someone asked me on a Twitter Q&A. I sometimes would do the podcast while driving in a car and take out my phone, call someone, and record the conversation. Make things easy when you first start something. I\u2019d wake up at 5:30 am and sometimes finish my article of the day by 8am. My articles that were the most popular I\u2019d print up, staple together, and walk around with a very rough draft of a book. Since each article was popular I knew the combination would be popular. I rewrote each chapter to have more information. More stories. I had a point of view. I knew what had helped me bounce back because for 20 years I had been bouncing back. I had an opinion about home ownership because I owned twice and lost big. I knew about college because I could see how many lives it was ruining from debt. I went on other podcasts and that helped me build my audience. I started speaking at motivational conferences and I met a lot of people. I\u2019m an introvert so it\u2019s hard for me to network one on one. But if I\u2019m speaking to a lot of people it\u2019s not so bad and allows me to do \u201cmass networking\u201d. Just like my Twitter Q&As were mass networking. And even the blog comments area was mass networking. Very exciting: I was getting my first death threats but also a lot of people enjoyed what I was writing and for the first time in a long time I was making new friends. You can\u2019t make money directly from a blog, but a blog is just the wheel and you make money from all the spokes. SPOKE AND WHEEL: Blog is the wheel, the money opportunities are the spokes. Podcast. My audience from blog tranferred over to my podcast. One of my podcasts, \u201cQuestion of the Day\u201d was paying me up to $20,000 a month. And \u201cThe James Altucher Show\u201d which didn\u2019t have ads until episode 159 was funding my new business. I have done the absolute basic on monetizing my blog (I barely put ads on and that\u2019s it) and can do much much more. But right now it generates about $500,000 in revenues, give or take, with minimal effort. Some of my podcasts have zero ads. Some have one. Occasionally I have two.Newsletters. I had 16 years experience as a professional investor and writer about investing. I wanted to write about finance again but not really for everyone. I was tired of all the comments I would get. Every spectator has an opinion. Nor did I want to start a hedge fund which would only make rich people more rich. So I charged for a newsletter about stocks. Then I created more newsletters in that business and hired analysts. I wrote about stocks, other investing strategies, etc. That business has done over $120 million in revenues since I started in 2015 and was profitable from month 2.Speaking. I don\u2019t do many speaking engagements right now but I was being paid up to $30,000 per talk. I started out with $4500 a talk. And most talks I still gave (and still do) for free. (talk at Google. Which I did for free) Investment opportunities. Because I was writing a lot about my own experiences as an entrepreneur and I was writing for the popular blog, TechCrunch, I started to get opportunities to be on boards and get stock and invest a little bit of money. Time will tell how they will all do but so far so good.Books. This past year I got an offer to do another book from a mainstream publisher. I am more excited about this book than any book I\u2019ve ever written. It\u2019s what and how I\u2019ve learned by changing careers over a dozen times, some failures, some successes, and how to quickly reach the top in any area that you want to reinvent yourself in. Why do I get a book offer? Because for years I\u2019ve been building an audience with a blog.TV. I was an advisor on one TV show (\u201cBillions\u201d) and I\u2019ve now pitched three other TV shows. \u201cBillions\u201d didn\u2019t pay much ($30,000 for a season) and the other shows are still works in progress but we\u2019ll see. I am able to pitch TV shows because producers can see the strong stances I take on a variety of topics and then ask me to pitch them ideas. When I wrote a blog post about throwing away all of my belongings and living in Airbnbs I got calls from about ten agents and production companies, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s company, Amblin. We\u2019ll see what happens! (my credit at the end of Billions) Merchandise. In the process of setting up a store on Amazon. I have jackets, t-shirts, glasses, etc. I don\u2019t expect this to be a big money maker but I like the idea of having a brand that represents the ideas I share. I\u2019m even working on a game right now. Why not? Patreon. I don\u2019t have a \u201cpatreon\u201d for my blog or podcast BUT I am a \u201cpatron\u201d on Patreon of all of my favorite podcasts. Kevin Kelly has the theory \u201call you need is 1000 TRUE fans to make a living.\u201d Set up a page on http://Patreon.com for your podcast or blog. Give people awards depending on what tier they support you. Have tiers range from $10 to $1000. Once you get 1000 patreon supporters I am sure you will be making a living.Affiliate Deals. Let\u2019s say a friends of yours has developed a diet. You try it for six months and lose weight and feel great. Now your friend has a course he\u2019s selling about the diet. You write about the diet, your personal experience, etc and you link to it. He gives your blog readers a discount if they use a promo code with your name on it. BOOM! Now you split the revenues with your friend 50/50. That\u2019s an affiliate deal. I have never done this with blog or podcast but if I really believe in a product then I have no problem with this. This could be a huge win and make much more than advertisers.Sponsors/Advertisers. I\u2019m not a big believer in these for a blog but have nothing against it for a podcast. I think you will spend too much time chasing advertisers.Subscription Community. For people passionate about the same topic you are blogging about, set up a subscription community. It can be on Facebook, for instance, and before people can join they have to venmo the subscription price.The blog is the center of the wheel, then you find the spokes. Everything you love doing can be the center of the wheel. The money part comes from finding the spokes. \u2014 When Matthew Berry quit writing screenplays in Hollywood, he started writing a blog for almost nothing. He turned that into a community obsessed with his writing. That then turned into a subscription community (a spoke), that he then sold. He then became the first sports anchor ever at ESPN to focus on fantasy sports. He changed his life because his writing was great, people loved his blog, and he created multiple spokes. \u2014 Ramit Sethi started a blog for young people about how to manage their finances. He turned that into NYT bestselling book, \u201cI Will Teach You To Be Rich\u201d, a newsletter, a course company, and various other money-making ventures. If I were to guess, I\u2019d say his business does about twenty to 25 million dollars a year, all because he started a blog for free. \u2014 John Lee Dumas was an early podcaster. He loved interviewing people about businesses. But he also loved the entire field of podcasting. He loved writing about it. He set up a Facebook community all about podcasting. Podcasters could ask questions, help each other, and feel part of the passionate community he set up. To join the community I forget the exact cost but I think it\u2019s $1000 and he has 1,000s of members, which means he\u2019s made millions on it. \u2014- Step 1: Passion. Take anything you love Step 2: Blog. Start blogging about it (or podcasting) Step 3: Spoke & Wheel. The blog is the core of the wheel, now each spoke (the spokes listed above, is a potential money-making opportunity. Experiment with as many spokes as possible. Each experiment will teach you what works and what doesn\u2019t. Each experiment will engage your friends. And the successful experiments will make you a lot of money. ",

            "answer_text": "A blog is not a business Yes, repeat after me: A Blog is Not a Business! Let me explain this further. Information used to be precious like gold. Whoever knows something that most people don\u2019t, win\u2014a few decades ago. It still hold true today. The only problem is that today, everyone knows almost everything. The value of information has dropped drastically over a few decades. While most information on the Internet are free today\u2014like every answer here in Quora\u2014it\u2019s almost impossible for you to simply create some craps\u2014regardless it\u2019s a blog post, a YouTube video, or an info-product\u2014and call it a business. \u2014 \u201cBut Noah, there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers and content creators who are making a full-time income online. What about them?\u201d True. In fact, my business Appsumo and Sumo are operating online and generating an 8-figure revenue combined. Clearly making money online is possible. But before we talk about starting a blog, let\u2019s talk about business. As I mentioned in one of my Quora answer - How can I make a living by starting an online business? \u2026 the formula for building a successful business hasn\u2019t changed for a long time, and there are a lot of consistencies in approach whether it\u2019s online or offline. When you break it down, there are a few critical components for a business to work: A group of customers with a serious problem who are willing to pay someone else to solve a problem.A solution \u2014 product or services \u2014 that solves that particular pain point.A marketing channel to connects the solution to the problem.A payment channel that allows the customers to pay / buy and the solution provider (you) to receive payments.To make money, regardless online or offline, you need to identify a group of audience you want to serve, then spend the time figure out their biggest pain point. An alternative way is to identify a serious pain point, then spend the time figure out the group of people with similar problem. Then, make a hypothesis of the solution to the problem for this particular group of people. This is how you come up with a business idea, create a minimal viable product and validate it. That said, you don\u2019t need a blog to build a business and start making money. \u2014 But you want to start a blog right? Cool! Let us look at a few business models with a blog.  The first business model is widely used by major publications. What they do is that they build a huge group of audiences, then place ads on their sites. However, to generate a compelling income from ads requires a large number of pageviews. Major publications like Entrepreneur and Inc accomplish this by publishing 10 to 50 posts a day, covering a wide range of topics. With this model, every inch of your site is a real estate for ads. You can also partner with brands and products to generate revenue as an affiliate. Here, you promote someone else\u2019s product and get a percentage of commission for every successful sale made.  The next business model is very popular among niche blogs in various topics like self-improvement, weight loss, digital marketing and more. You first need to create content and provide value upfront to attract loyal fans. When your audience reaches a certain size, create products around their needs. With this business model, you get to ask your audience what they need. However, you still need to do research to find out if target audience has a problem that you can solve. What you don\u2019t want is to spend two years building an audience with ZERO interests in buying anything. An excellent example of a blog with this business model is my best friend Neville from KopywritingKourse.com. He builds his blog to a 6-figure business from scratch.  The last business model is very similar to the previous one. The only difference here is that the last business model focuses on creating a solution for a problem first. When the solution (product) gains traction, you then move on to building a blog around that product to attract leads and customers This business model is widely used by SaaS startup and is exactly the business model I\u2019m using for Sumo. In this case, the blog is a marketing arm for our products. \u2014 Now you see, a blog is not a business by itself. To make money online starting a blog, you first need to figure out the fundamentals of your business. Ask yourself: Who is your audience?What is the biggest frustration your audience facing?How can you help them to solve that?In fact, a blog is just one of the many channels available. When you get the fundamentals right, you can pick a business model stated above, and replace \u201cblog\u201d with any content format or platform. One more thing, these business models aren\u2019t stand alone. You can combine them to maximize your desired outcome regardless it\u2019s to build a brand, to create awareness, or to generate revenue. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what you need to make money starting a blog from scratch to finish. Pick a Domain Name. The first thing that you need is a website and a domain name so that people can find you online. I recommend that you create your website using the WordPress platform, it\u2019s best for blog post type of websites. Then you can get a domain at go daddy, Bluehost, HostGator or any other hosting company. There\u2019s plenty of them, you will be lost with choice.After establishing your website, it\u2019s time to build it up and set up everything so that it looks good, presentable and most importantly, it\u2019s user friendly. Here\u2019s a video of how to set up your navigation menus on a WordPress website 3. Pick Your Niche. Choose the niche or the topic of the website. This is what you will write about. It\u2019s usually considered best practice to stick to only one niche per website. In other words, if you decide to blog about gaming equipment then do just that. Don\u2019t make a blog post about the best cooking recipes for cakes after you\u2019ve made 3 articles related to gaming equipment. Stick to one topic for a website. 4. Prepare to Write. Preparing your articles before you write them is important if you want to be as efficient as you can possibly be. Knowing what you will blog about and structuring your article can be time-saving and productive at the same time. Do thorough research on the topic that you will blog about and focus on key factors that people are looking for. These people should be interested in what you blog about, but how do you find what key terms people are searching for related to your niche? 5. Keyword Research. Do keyword research to determine what people are searching for on search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo. For example, if you\u2019ve decided to write a blog post about correct positioning during exercise because your niche is health and fitness, using keyword research tools can help. By using a research tool you can figure out the exact search terms that people who want to know about correct positioning during exercise are typing on Google and the other search engines and add them inside your articles to rank on page one for these specific terms. 6. Write Your Article. Write an article using the above-mentioned steps, and try to be as informative and extensive as possible. Take your time to cover everything that you think is important and be sure to provide lots of value and high quality to your readers. Make it engaging, entertaining and resourceful. Now, keep writing articles and try to do it as often as possible. About 2\u20133 times per week should be enough, but the more you do it, the faster you will see results. How to monetize your articles and blog posts? It\u2019s really easy to do that because when you target a keyword and write content on it when someone stumbles upon it, they will be looking for it. In other words, people will always be interested in what you have to blog about. This increases traffic quality by a lot. The best way to monetize your articles is to implement affiliate links on them. You can Learn Affiliate Marketing For Beginners here. By adding affiliate links onto your content, people can click on them which will lead them onto an offer page with an option to make a purchase. When they do that, you will be paid a percentage of the profits in the form of commissions. You can find different affiliate networks with stuff to promote on websites such as ClickBank and promote them from there. This is a great way to earn passive income as once you get that content ranked onto the top of the search results, your work will keep bringing you results. This can results in passive income online by blogging, which is pretty decent when you think about it.

            "answer_text": " Ok, here you go. This is how you actually make money blogging. First\u2026Yes, you can do it. It\u2019s not too late. It doesn't matter if your not a great writer. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t think you have anything to say. What does matter is that you are willing to put the effort in. Second\u2026Some ground rules. If you are going to be a successful blogger then the number one thing you have to do is JUST GET STARTED BLOGGING. Secure hosting and start a blog today.If you are going to be a successful blogger then the number two thing you have to do is be consistent. You don\u2019t have to blog for 4 hours a day, everyday. Sure you are going to have to put a little more time in up front as you learn a new skill. But after you get comfortable you can realistically run a successful blog for around 8 hours a week.Third\u2026Chose a blog topic or niche. Don\u2019t go after niches or topics that you think will make a lot of money. You are going to be creating a lot of content. Make sure it\u2019s a topic you are interested in. You don\u2019t have to be knowledgeable about it. You can learn, and the write, and then learn, and then write. But you have to be interested in it. Fourth\u2026Find products for sale on Amazon related to your niche. Hint: This should be easy\u2026Amazon sells EVERYTHING. Fifth\u2026Join the Amazon associates program. It\u2019s their affiliate program. When you refer someone to their site\u2026and they buy something\u2026you make a percentage of the sales. Sure the percentage you make from an Amazon referral is a lot smaller than what you make from say a Clickbank sale. But Amazon sales convert. You don\u2019t even need to know how to sell. Amazon does all the work for you. You just have to get them there (ethically.) Remember 8% of something is a heck of a lot better than 75% of nothing. Sixth\u2026Write product reviews. Write honest reviews about products related to your blog. Give the pros and cons and tell people where they can purchase the product if they are interested (hint: Amazon using your affiliate link.) Seventh\u2026Cast your net. Write interesting articles that target a very specific topic. If you start a fitness blog don\u2019t waste your time writing articles like \u201cHow to Get Awesome Abs.\u201d There is a crap load of competition from people who have been doing this way longer than you. Instead focus on articles like \u201cShould I Eat Blueberries or Strawberries on My Granola in the Morning When I\u2019m Planning on Running 7 Miles in the Afternoon?\u201d Ok, that might be a little too specific, but you get my point. Dig deeper than everyone else. And then at the end of the post maybe put a link to a different article titled \u201c3 of My Favorite Pairs of Running Shorts\u201d where you recommend 3 awesome pairs of running shorts that happen to be for sale on Amazon. Just make sure the product review is related to the original article. And that\u2019s how you make money blogging. And as you grow then you can do things like create your own courses and private label products related to your blog and sell them on Amazon. But it\u2019s totally reasonable to make $1200 to $2000 per month, per blog, with only affiliate commissions from Amazon. If you want to scale and grow faster\u2026you might consider branching out to YouTube. A lot of people think you tube is saturated or that it\u2019s too late. However, quite the opposite is true.  Oh and if you like the video, please give it a little thumbs up or leave me a comment\u2026I\u2019d appreciate it. ",

Starting a Blog \u2013 My Journey I started blogging seven months ago in July 2016 and haven\u2019t looked back since then. I am already making a full-time income with my blog, and you can do it too. My journey has been an amazing one from the day one and I totally love what I am doing. Blogging has given me the security of having another income, spend time with my family and pursue my passion for helping others. Coming to the money making aspect, I started making money from my blog in the third month and now I am making over $4000/month from my blog. What I love about this is, it has been mostly passive form of income. All this would not have been possible if I didn\u2019t take the step to start a blog.

In this post, I will show you the step-by-step process of starting a blog to make money and share the tips to grow traffic to your new blog. But first, let me answer some questions which are in your mind. So, What exactly is a Blog? A blog is like a digital journal where you talk about your passions or interests. It is a place where you share and help others with your expertise and talk about what you love. You need to choose your niche and your area of interest related to your blog. My blog, Crowd Work News is all about side hustles, work-at-home jobs and money-making tips. Choosing your niche can be a long process because it has to be something which you are interested in. Use this trick when selecting your niche, if you can come up with around 30 post topics in your niche, then it is a good one. Can anybody start a blog? Absolutely. Blogging is one side hustle where you don\u2019t need any expertise to start and you can still make considerable income from it. Whether you are a stay-at-home mum or a student or a retiree or someone looking to supplement your income, you can start a blog to explore your options of making money online. You don\u2019t need any technical or special writing skills for blogging. Making money from blogging doesn\u2019t require special skills, but it does require the same amount of hard work and dedication as any other work-at-home job. What can you write about in a blog aka blog ideas? Ask yourself \u201cWhat do you love doing?\u201d. I like finding new ways of making money online. I have been working from home for eight years now, so I wanted to help others to choose a location-independent income option. That\u2019s when my blog got kicked off. You should always blog about what you love. So, try to brainstorm what you are good at. Are you good at making desserts or cooking?Do you just love talking about your lifestyle and your mum life?Are you good at organizing things?Do you love money management?Are you a fashion junkie?Are you an expert in Web Design?There are millions of blogs on every topic, so anything is a possible blogging option. How much money can you make blogging? It totally depends on many factors but it is possible to make a good income from blogging. My life totally changed when I started earning in the 3rd month of my blog. Though it was a small amount, it has been growing every day. Now, I am making much more than that. If you use the right strategies, then making money with your new blog is surely possible. In some cases, it might take time, but it\u2019s possible. Check out my previous month\u2019s report to understand those strategies. Of all the side hustles or work-at-home jobs, blogging can give you a great possibility of making money online. Let\u2019s get into the process of start a blog and make money, 1. Brainstorm a Good Domain Name It is the first step you take when you start a blog. A domain name is pretty much like your address on the web. For example, my domain name is crowdworknews.com. Choose a domain name which relates to your niche, and this might take some brainstorming because not all domain names you want might be available. You can register your domain name with any registrar such as GoDaddy, Network Solutions or you can register the domain name directly with Bluehost. I would suggest you go with Bluehost so that it\u2019s not too complicated for you and you have both your domain name and hosting with one company. You get a domain name FREE if you sign up with Bluehost for a 12-month plan. I have signed up for 36 months, as it works out to be cheaper than paying every month. There are free web hosting options like WordPress and Blogger , but if you are serious about making money from your blog, then you need to go with a self-hosted option.Blogger With a self-hosted blog, you monetize it fairly quickly, and you own all your content. If you want to start your blogging journey on the right foot, then go with self-hosted. I have hosted my blog with Bluehost, and I never had any issues with it. It offers the lowest price for hosting, and I am very pleased with their support. 2. Get started After you go to the homepage of Bluehost you will see this screen, click on \u2018Get Started now.\u2019  Then you will come to the web page below, where you have three options for hosting namely Basic, Plus and Prime. I am with the Basic plan and that is more than enough for me. You can always update the plan later if you need.  Another reason why I recommend the 12-month plan is, you save a lot of money when compared to paying month by month. It covers many things along with a FREE domain when you sign up for a 12-month plan, and this is just for $2.95/month! 3. Register or Connect your Domain name Now is the time to register the domain name that you chose earlier. If you have your domain name with other hosting providers, you can always transfer it here.  4. Choose your Package After you have given your details, you come to this screen where you have to choose your package. I started off with a 36-month plan at $2.95 per month. If you don\u2019t want to go for a long-term plan, then you can go with a 12-month plan. It saves a lot of money.  As a beginner blogger, you don\u2019t need to worry about the extras. If you need them, you can always update them later. 5. Install WordPress And now for the best part, Bluehost automatically installs your WordPress after you sign up for hosting so that you don\u2019t need to any techie stuff!  You just have to login with your WordPress credentials. Your blog is ready!! You need themes to make your blog look good. You have to log into WordPress and then go to \u2018Themes\u2019. There will be some free ones that are available to you. You can always use free themes to design your blog, but if you want to go with paid themes, then I suggest Genesis. My blog is with Genesis theme and I highly recommend it if you want to go for a paid one. Time to Start Writing for Your New Blog The important thing I did and would advise you is, have rough drafts of at least ten posts before you launch your website. That way you have your content ready, and you can work on the promotion when the launch happens. Try to understand what your readers want, read their comments and know what they need. Writing and promoting go hand in hand. Writing a post can be relatively easy when you know a lot about your niche but trying to solve a reader\u2019s problem is something which is going to get returning traffic. One thing I do is, go to forums and places like Reddit, Quora. There are discussions here, and they can be a gold mine for your blog post ideas. You can also sign up for Google Trends, you will get top trending news about your niche, which can be good post topics. How to Get Traffic to Your Blog When I first launched my blog, I did follow all the steps as mentioned above and started promoting it heavily, and I ended up getting over 16,000 page views in the first month of my blogging. Content is the king, but promotion is the audience. Here are some tips to start getting traffic right from the launch of your blog: 1. Before the launch, let your friends, family and others know about the launching of your blog. That way, right from the first day of your launch, you can see some good traffic. It is also an excellent time to start growing your list. You can have a landing page where the readers can sign up for your list. 2. Set up your social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram from the start. I started with these platforms and Stumbleupon. Share your blog news on the social media and promote it on all of them at first, to see where you get more traction. Don\u2019t try to be on all platforms; it is going to be very tiring for you. Once you figure out where you are getting most of your traffic, focus more on that channel. 3. Join Facebook groups relevant to your niche and promote. As you have targeted audience in these groups, you can see a rise in traffic. Share your posts regularly on your FB page, and most of the Facebook experts say sharing 4-5 posts shows good reach on Facebook. 4. Use Pinterest a lot. I didn\u2019t focus on Pinterest in the first two months of my blog, but after third month I was using this platform and saw my traffic numbers go up exponentially. Pinterest has been great for many bloggers, and it can do wonders for you as well. It can be very overwhelming to get into the Pinterest game. You can take the help of tools like Boardbooster or Tailwind to schedule pins. I use both of them along with my manual pinning. 5. Always test different social media channels with different timings, types of posts and see what works. I have experimented a lot with my schedules and the types of posts I share. When I first started with Pinterest, the growth was very slow, I researched what worked on that social media and started pinning that content. No two social media channels are the same, and one strategy might not work for another. 6. Getting organic traffic is a more stable way to keep up your traffic numbers. SEO takes time and you need to learn a lot. I am just starting with SEO and will keep you updated about my traffic. Ways to Make Money Blogging There are many ways to monetize a blog such as display advertising, affiliate marketing, sponsorships, product sales, etc. How much you can make from each these methods depends on your traffic and reach. I love affiliate marketing, and most of my blog income comes from affiliates. It is the most passive way to make money with a blog. You have to apply as a publisher with the affiliate programs like iGain, Flex Offers, Shareasale, Maxbounty. Once you are accepted, you choose your brands and start promoting. These are the affiliate programs I am with and I have seen good conversions with them. I will share a detailed post about what are the ways that you can make money from blogging especially with affiliate marketing. You are all set to start a blog now! Blogging is a very profitable side hustle or for that matter a full-time income earner for me. It has given me the freedom to pursue what I love instead of trading my time for work. It has proved to be a very flexible and profitable money-making option for me (I am a total non-techie), and it can work great for you too. Source : Crowdworknews.com ",

            "answer_text": "First, many people have become millionaires through blogging. It\u2019s possible. Some of those people have done it in just a few years. You do NOT become wealthy by screwing people or tricking them. It rarely happens and when it does, it rarely lasts. You become wealthy by creating value in the world, by solving problems. Honestly, while click bait sites are annoying, you\u2019ve followed those links, haven\u2019t you. And you\u2019ve done it more than once. If they don\u2019t deliver on their headline you stop clicking eventually. The best ones actually provide some kind of entertainment that keeps people clicking on them. When you do what you love, money does NOT necessarily follow! In fact, it often doesn\u2019t follow when you do what you love. I\u2019m not saying it couldn\u2019t, but this is simply not good advice. My version of this is: \u201cDo what you love and if you don\u2019t make any money at least you\u2019re doing what you love.\u201d Money follows when you create value in the world that people are willing to pay for. You have to solve a problem for people that they want solved. Ads and affiliate sales are NOT the most profitable ways to monetize a blog. If you have any hope of making real money blogging, then forget ads. You need a very high volume of page views, like about 1\u20132 million per month to generate enough income to pay your bills, let alone become a millionaire.  Obviously, I can\u2019t attest to your abilities or your blog ideas, but assuming both are good, here\u2019s the formula. Understand that a blog is not a business. You\u2019ll never make money from a blog. On the other hand, a business does make money and a blog is a good marketing tool to get new customers. Pick one. Blog or business. If you want to become a millionaire, then understand that you\u2019re a business that blogs, not a blog that does business.Create a product: eBook, online course, membership site, software.Grow your email list. Your email list is your most important asset.\u201cSell\u201d your product. I put sell in quotes because you could sell your product for money or you could sell it for an email address. But understand that the concepts are the same. You create products that solve problems and charge for them. That email address is more valuable in the long run than a single sale for money.Pay for ads to drive traffic to your landing pages where you encourage people to sign up for your email list in exchange for your product.Understand that marketing is a multi-step process. Don\u2019t bother asking cold traffic to buy something for money. Marketing is a seduction. Keep drawing them closer to you with free or small offerings. Your real goal is not to sell products, it\u2019s to build a relationship with them based on trust. Once they know, like and trust you, they are MUCH more likely to buy from you.Sell more expensive products to your list. The best products are online video training courses and/or membership sites.Keep growing your list. Keep creating value.This is a well worn blueprint for becoming a millionaire from blogging. It won\u2019t be easy and it will take some time. The fastest I\u2019ve seen is about three years, but for those who achieve it, it often happens within 5\u20137 years. There are people who\u2019ve succeeded by selling other people\u2019s products rather than creating their own. However, I find that they all eventually move toward selling their own products. The revenue is just way better. ",

            "answer_text": "People here are lying to you and trying to sell you services. The answer is, no, a blog all by itself will make you pennies at best. That\u2019s because of simple math. There are millions of web sites and not that many people interested in reading amateur opinions. Second, it takes thousands and thousands of ad impressions to make a few bucks. Are YOU really going to get thousands and thousands of impressions? Can you live on a few bucks? And, even then, there are podcasts and vlogs, which do better \u2014 if you are interesting, for the former, or good looking, for the latter. And it takes a lot of time to get there. I have a blog-style web site with a real brand and money comes in in dribs and drabs. And I\u2019ve been at it for 10 years. I certainly could not live off of this unpredictable income. Now, if your blog is either of these, it could make money: Hyperlocal (you go to local events and meetings and report on them) and you go to local businesses and sell banner and other types of ads yourself \u2014 don\u2019t use Google, Facebook or other such sites to give you ads \u2014 you could make a go of it. That\u2019s if you\u2019re a good journalist. I know of some people who have made $100,000 a year this way. But it\u2019s a lot of work.Niche multimedia. You don\u2019t just write, but also develop a brand where you have podcasts, sell coffee mugs, promote appearances, etc., etc. You build trust \u2014 no direct ads, but people like YOU and want to support you in some way. Having a niche will make you the expert and like-minded advertisers will eventually support you. For example, if you have a popular guns blog, maybe Smith & Wesson will sponsor it. This also is a lot of work.Neither of these will make you money NOW. It may be years, so do something you naturally love and would do for free anyway. If it works out, it works out. The secret to making money is to not be desperate. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, there\u2019s no way to make money blogging without a web audience. So, before we discuss monetizing your blog, let\u2019s talk about getting an audience. You don\u2019t necessarily need millions of people visiting your blog on a monthly basis. For every 1,000 visitors/month on growthmarketingpro.com, we make $500/month. Still, bottom line: the number visitors your blog has corresponds to the income it produces. In any form of business, you have to win people\u2019s trust to sell them something. The same rule holds for blogging. Offer your visitors something of genuine value. They have to have a reason to come back to your blog frequently. If you\u2019re an expert in your field, be a thought leader and start a blog! Be Active Frequently The biggest mistake many bloggers make in the beginning is not blogging frequently. Being a blogger takes a lot of commitment. Some blogs don\u2019t start getting an organic following for 3-6 months. Only Publish Quality Content A good barometer should be, \u201cwould I read and genuinely enjoy this post?\u201d If you don\u2019t like your own writing, how could some other internet peruser? If you\u2019re going to be a thought leader in your niche space, you better be a really, really quality one. Almost always, I see a correlation between how much time I spend on a post and the amount of traffic the post gets.  If you want Google to rank your content in Google searches, it must be best-in-class. The Google algorithm is very sophisticated. It knows good content vs bad content. Use Social Media Social media is the best place to reach out to the audience that will be interested in your content. Join communities on social media that are relevant to the content and theme of your blog. Interact with people there and ask them to pay a visit to your blog. Provide a link to your blog on your social networking profiles. Doing this will \u201cdistribute\u201d your blog content. This will \u201cput you on the map\u201d so to speak.  On social media: Further cementing your status as a thought leader by sharing relevant and thoughtful updatesInteract with others interestedAttract users with links to your contentUse social media! Your friends and connections will likely be your early readers. Try Guest Blogging Guest blogging is one of the perfect ways to get people\u2019s attention to your blog. Guest blogging means you write a blog post and give it to some reputable and well-known blog to host it. These blogs already have thousands of people visiting them, and so you will have to chance to benefit from their traffic. I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time guest blogging, as you want to make sure your best content is on your blog. But as a way to get your readership and organic traffic off the ground, it can be useful. Design Your Blog in an Appealing Way The looks of your blog can play a huge role in bringing people back to the blog. When it comes to the design, the first thing you want to do is make the content easily scannable. It should be organized and relatively explanatory. Ask yourself, \u201cif I landed on this website, would I \u2018get it?\u2019\u201d Match the color theme of your blog with the mood of the content. Keep the contrasts such that the text is easy to read. Try to make your posts more clickable by adding pictures to them. A Self-hosted Blog Is Better As attractive as it sounds to have a free blog like Tumblr or Medium, but it will not serve you in the long run. For the love of god, start a WordPress blog or some other type of self-hosted blog. First of all, you will not have your own identity because the name of your blogging platform will appear in your domain name. People who visit your blog will see the domain name and realize that you are not serious about your passion. But more importantly, these are not optimal for SEO. WordPress, Ghost and other CMS blogs be optimal for attracting \u201corganic\u201d visitors \u2014 users who simply \u201cstumble on\u201d your blog while Googling \u201cbest way to fix a Volvo\u201d or \u201chow to monetize your blog?\u201d Read choosing the best blogging platform if you still have questions. But, you should probably start a WordPress blog. The Many Ways to Monetize Your Blog 1. Monetize Your Blog Selling Online Courses Selling online courses is one of the most popular ways for bloggers to make money.  You can generate income even with only a few thousand readers by selling online courses. Just make sure you\u2019re niche enough that your readers can\u2019t get your information through a simple Google search. But if you know some things your audience is willing to pay for, you use a tool like Teachable or Udemy to create and sell your course. The idea here is to know your audience and create a course that addresses their particular needs. People will pay for good advice online! An important thing to know here is to realize your authority as an author. Do not underestimate yourself by thinking that you are not an expert. An advantage that bloggers have is that their readers see them as thought leaders. Marketer Neil Patel, is pretty prolific marketing blogger who promotes and monetizes his blog with a combination of online courses and consulting. 2. Monetize with Ebooks Many of the same tactics as above will help you monetize your blog with ebooks. As with selling online courses, you have to write what you\u2019re most passionate and knowledgeable about. You should should make it graphically pleasing \u2014 maybe consider creating some infographics in Piktochart? Here\u2019s an infographic I made about the best blogging platforms.  Assemble the whole ebook in a tool like Apple\u2019s Keynote, a locked Google Doc or in some other format you like. A quick Google search confirms that there are even some options for make-your-own ebook software. Use Canva to make an ebook. In order to collect money from your sales, use PayPal or Stripe or some other digital way to collect payments. 3. Monetize Your Blog by Selling Other People\u2019s Stuff: Affiliate Marketing This has proven to be the most popular and one of the most lucrative ways of monetizing a blog. You can earn a few hundreds dollars a year, or in the case of a large affiliate marketing company like NerdWallet \u2014 which sells leads to credit card companies \u2014 over $100 million. If you\u2019re monetizing your blog with affiliate marketing, you promote certain products or services of a company in exchange for part of each of that company\u2019s sale. If you have bought a plane ticket on Expedia or Search Flights, Hotels & Rental Cars | KAYAK, you\u2019ve transacted with an affiliate. Expedia and Kayak certainly don\u2019t fly your plane, but they do sell you the ticket. They take a cut of every sale. The affiliate marketing universe is huge. There\u2019s literally thousands of companies that are affiliates of other goods and services.  Affiliate marketing works for a lot of blogger verticals: Fashion bloggers who sell shoes or bags to their readership with affiliate partnerships in placeTech bloggers who get a cut of every gadget their audience buys through their linksIndustry bloggers who promote trusted software toolsFinance bloggers who recommend certain credit cardsHow to become an affiliate partner: Reach out to the companies in your niche and build a one-off partnershipMany companies will have a link somewhere on their site to an affiliate page where you can sign upSign up for sites like Commission Junction and browse through all the products you can sellSign up for AmazonAssociates and sell any Amazon product and earn a 4%-10% commission on every sale.If you have a business or product and you\u2019re trying to build an affiliate program so that other people will sell your stuff for you, I recommend reading my Secret Growth Hack to Building an Affiliate Program.

            "answer_text": "There are a variety of ways to earn money online. Having a blog and monetizing it is a great example of earning income and having fun doing so. To earn money through a blog there are several important factors to cover: your niche, website, and dedication. All of them are closely related to each other and are crucial factors if you wish to earn money through blogging. Let's talk about that.  Niche. Writing about things you are passionate about is necessary for a successful blog. However, if writing isn\u2019t your strong side, you can hire someone to write the content for you. Writing good content is essential to attract readers, that's why choosing a niche you like is crucial - your interest in it strongly reflects in your content. Website. Creating a website doesn't cost much. $0.99/mo is enough to get you going. Although, once you start gaining traffic, you will have to upgrade the plan for the best performance. Your website has to be convenient to use and easy to navigate. If users have a hard time doing so, they are most likely to leave. By what attributes do people rate the website? Well, the main ones would be the design, ease of use, and the loading speed. Make sure your website is not overloaded with elements, so it's easy to find relevant content. The website's layout, fonts, and elements have to be appealing to the eye, as well it should be easy to navigate. Your website\u2019s design can be improved using online tools such as heatmap. This tool determines the most eye-catching spots of your website, helping your site become more user-friendly. Loading speed is another crucial part of a website. You don't want to risk losing your visitors, so it's necessary to assure they aren't waiting for your blog to load. The quick loading time depends not only on your web host but on you too. Read how your hosting provider improves its services for the best performance. From your side, you can analyze your website through GTmetrix and fix the issues that are noted about your website. If you plan to use WordPress to create your blog, then be certain the provider is optimized for WordPress as well.  Dedication. Here's the most important thing you must know - results take time to come. Once you have created a blog, you have to start building up the content. To earn profit from the blog, traffic is a must. If the niche you have chosen is oversaturated, it might take a bit longer to get traffic. With lots of dedicated time and motivation, the results are sure to come. Ways to earn money through a blog: Once you have built up your website and started creating content, it's time to learn about earning money through it - monetizing. Affiliate marketing. One of the most popular ways of earning money online. The idea behind affiliate marketing is that you promote a product or service of a company you became an affiliate of and earn a commission. To become a successful affiliate, you need to find a company whose products or services you would like to promote and choose the way you are going to promote it. A few of the things you can do is write reviews about the company's services and products, include affiliate links, or even add videos to your blog about the products or services you are an affiliate of. Ads. Placing ads is a great way to increase your income from a blog. One of the most popular ways to do so is using Google Adsense due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Keep in mind that your website should look decent and user friendly, so don't put lots of ads that would disturb the visitor. Freelancing. Having a blog and built up traffic is a great way to let people know you are up to business inquiries. Whether you are writing about food, travelling, or art, your blog can become your portfolio. People will get to see your skills and send you job offerings if they are satisfied with the experience you have and the content you create. Sponsored content. Whether you wish to find companies that would sponsor you or they find you themselves, it becomes a great opportunity to increase the earnings. Some offers may ask you to share a company's article on your blog, while some may ask you to write one about them yourself. Each company includes different ways to do it, but make sure to choose the one you are comfortable with.  Here are some of the most beneficial ways to earn money through a blog. Keep in mind that it doesn't come instantly, and you have to work hard for it. In the end, the results are worth it. I hope this article has helped you. Take care of your website, and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": " 1billion +. That is the number of total world blog posts. Why is that relevant? Well the world isn't short of bloggers! Information is cheaper than ever now. Even for world class content, most people aren\u2019t willing to pay more than $10 on Amazon for a book. What people want is implementation. People lead busy lives. So the way to use a blog is to pay for implementation. Typical example. You are a lawyer. Even if you offer world class advice, do you think most people would be willing to spend $1,000 on a legal book!? Of course not. Many wealthy clients would be willing to spend that on an emergency though - to implement. If you are an IT security expert, I doubt many people would be willing to spend even $100 on an IT security book. But if there computer has a huge problem? Some businesses would be wiling to spend $10,000+. Likewise, my clients are wiling to pay me well to implement my knowledge to help them make more money and save them time. They wouldn't even be willing to less 5% of that money on reading my book. So focus on what you are good at. Get your name out there. Charge for implementation, not just the knowledge. Also don\u2019t listen to people who say it is easy to monetize with things like Adsense. I have 30,000+ visitors a month, but Adsense would never pay that much. Things like Adsense and affiliate marketing are good for side incomes, in certain industries, that\u2019s all. Your bread and butter should be where you can add value. That is likely to be your day job. This is especially the case if you have specialist knowledge that requires certain skills and qualifications. That is something 95% of those 1billion+ bloggers don\u2019t have.

            "answer_text": "As I\u2019m a professional blogger, I would like to guide you well to make money by starting a blog.  My blogging journey Around 2 years ago I started my blog. I was using a free version of bloggers(dot)com. Then after some months, I moved to WordPress and purchased domain and hosting. Then I started to work on my blog so seriously. I worked on my blog 12\u201315 months very seriously, but I could not get proper results. Actually I had learned basic blogging from YouTube and by reading other blogs on Google. I was experimenting with so many things. But I still did not get proper results. Then finally I did something right which is helping me to grow as a professional blogger and to earn money. So let me share, which things are helping me to make money from my blog. Tip #1 : Approaching the right person to learn professional blogging Many people think that why they should invest money to learn proper blogging. But you know what blogging is not just about writing articles and finding keywords. There are so many other things that one should learn to grow as a blogger and make money from blogging. You may think that you can learn blogging from YouTube. But in reality, YouTubers won\u2019t real all the secrets of blogging. They just guide you basic things they tell you to take their paid course. But all the courses which are available in the market such are SEO course, Digital Marketing course, Content Creation course etc are not good. So you must be sensible to approach the right person and learn proper blogging. I've approached the right person who taught me blogging very well. Within 2 months my many blog posts are ranking on Google\u2019s 1st position. And some posts are ranking as snippets. Now my blog is really improving day-by-day and my earning is also increasing. So I personally feel that one should invest some money to learn proper blogging. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t be a successful blogger if you don\u2019t take training in blogging. But if you don\u2019t take paid services you may take 8\u201310 years to be a successful blogger. But if you learn professional blogging then you will be a successful blogger within 6\u201312 months. And you will be earning so well.  Tip # 2 : Finding a niche is very important Choosing the right niche is really important. In the beginning, I made a mistake to choose the right niche for me. So I was not getting traffic on my blog and I was not making money from my blog. Your 90% problem will be solved automatically if you choose the right niche for your blog. But here many people do a big mistake that they see other bloggers and think that they also write on the same topic. But remember if another blogger is making more money from his/her blog then if you choose the same niche just because to earn money then you won\u2019t be a successful blogger and you won\u2019t earn money. So choose the niche which you really like and then check the competition level. Well, I was also having a problem in choosing my niche. But as I\u2019ve taken professional help, my mentor helped me to choose the right niche for me. So just don\u2019t randomly choose any niche, if possible then take professional help. Tip # 3 : Be consistent in blogging and publish more articles If you think that you will publish one article in a week then sorry, never choose blogging! Well, if blogging is just your hobby and if you don\u2019t want to earn money from blogging then consistency does not matter. But if you are dreaming to be very successful in blogging then be consistent and make more money. You should write and post at least 3\u20135 posts per week in the beginning. And the quality of the article should be good. So give importance to quality as well as quantity. Be a passionate blogger. Don\u2019t just do it for money but you must have that love and interest in writing. Tip # 4: Never ever copy other blogs Never ever copy others article. You will get punishment from Google and your blog won\u2019t rank on Google. Well, there is another term in blogging \u201cautomatic blogging\u201d. If you do all this then you will never rank on Google. Forget about earning money if you are copying other blog articles. Be a genuine and original blogger. Then no one can stop you to earn a lot of money from blogging. Share your own knowledge and experience with the readers. Then only your blog will rank on search engine and you will earn money. Tip # 5: Write a long blog post to make more money! I\u2019ve seen that some YouTubers tell that 500 words are enough. But let me tell you that there is so much competition in blogging. There are people who write 3000\u20134000 words blog post. If you just publish 500 words articles and expect to earn more money from blogging then I don\u2019t think this is the right way. Well, don\u2019t worry you don\u2019t need to write four thousand words article. But write at 1000\u20131500 words. Then you can beat the competition. And you will get rankings on Google. Ultimately you will be earning a lot of money from your blog.  Tip # 6: Use Google Adsense and Affiliate programs to earn money from a blog The first source of income from your blog will be Google Adsense and Affiliate marketing. So use both options. Apply for Google Adsense once your blog is ready. Well, you can apply for AdSense once you publish 5\u201310 articles. Then sign up for affiliate programs like Amazon, Flipkart etc. And you can also join Cluelinks which I personally like. This affiliate program includes many brands and companies so you can opt for it. This is how you will be earning money from your blog.

            "answer_text": "I go over how I managed to make almost $6450 from my affiliate blogs in May 2020 here and that level of income is enough for me to do this full time while I work on scaling it up to earn over $25,000 a month, hopefully by this time next year. Hopefully, the tips and tricks in this answer will be able to help anyone else get started in their blogging journey and have the highest possible chance of success and being able to make money from their blogging project moving forward. Before we get started though, I want to stress that even just getting my own affiliate blogs to $6450 a month has taken more work and effort than I ever thought it would. Even with the things that I share below, it is highly likley that you will still have to put an absolute ton of work into your own blogs to make them successful and be able to earn an income from them. That said though, staying consistent and sticking with your project for at least 12 months following the tips I outline below can offer surprising results and is what I have used to earn a personal best income day of $344.83 from the Amazon Affiliate program earlier this month. I offer a real insight into what you should be expecting as a beginner blogger just starting out for your first six months here as so many people have unrealistic expectations when just starting out. I go over how myself and others have used that same strategy to successfully grow a blog to over $600 per month income within that time frame and stress a number of pointers that you should take on board.  Also, this video goes over an average day in my life as a full-time affiliate blogger and as you can see from the clips, it is pretty standard as I am currently focusing on scaling my affiliate blog income up to over $25,000 a month. There's no sitting on a beach drinking cocktails just hard work and grinding and if you want to try and make a go of this then the video is probably worth watching for a reality check on what the next year might look like while you grow your blog. Choosing Your Blogging Niche The first place where most people seem to fail is that they, unfortunately, choose a niche that they should not be blogging in. I made this mistake myself when I first started and I chased the higher price point commissions to try and make as much money as possible. Not only was the competition extremely high so it was unlikely that I would actually get any traffic, I had little to no knowledge on the subject so the research time per article was extremely high so it took much longer than it should to publish an article. On top of this, it was hard to stay focused on these niches and stay motivated to stick with them and keep churning the content out. This is why I always recommend that you try to make your blogs about something that you are actually interested in and have a passion for. Not only will it help you stay interested in the subject but you are already very likley to have a ton of knowledge on the subject helping to drastically reduce the research time required to actually publish your content. When it comes to making money from your passion niches, there is almost always a way to earn from the content, especially if you think outside of the box but I will cover that in more detail later in the answer. I have seen some bloggers report some pretty unique income streams just showing that niches that you may instantly discount can work. Hosting One area where I see countless bloggers get wrong right from the very start is their hosting. Although there are a number of free blogging solutions, such as Blogger, these have been exploited over the years by the black hat search engine optimization community for quick and easy backlinks. This has forced Google to take steps to counter these tactics and one measure that they have taken is to make it very hard to actually index these free blogs. In my opinion, you should be going with a self-hosted blogging option from the very start as it will make everything much easier in the long run while also helping to increase the chances of you getting traffic from search engines. I would imagine that in this day and age, you could post similar articles on a self-hosted Wordpress solution and a free blogging platform and after a few months, your self-hosted solution will be starting to get traffic while your free solution is still struggling to get indexed. When it comes to a self-hosted blog where you actually pay the hosting company a monthly fee to host your site, the market is a minefield. Many people publish content on how to start your blog and give the impression that they are using Bluehost for their hosting solution when they are actually using another company. This is due to Bluehost offering the best commissions per signup via their affiliate program as shown in the image below.  As you can see in the image above, at the time of writing the Bluehost affiliate program offers their affiliates $65 per sign-up coming in at almost double what the other leading hosting providers are able to offer. On top of this, once you get enough sales, you are also able to negotiate with Bluehost to increase this commission further based on the retention of the people who sign up through your links. The screenshot below is from the transcript of Pat Flynn's \u201cAP 0149: Why Is Your Bluehost Affiliate Income So High?\u201d where he confirms that he has a custom commission rate with them. Although he does not give the exact commission he earns, I have seen people suggest that it is as high as $200 per sign up from the income from Bluehost that he shows in his income reports.   You may have to wait 15 to 30 seconds for the .gif above to load on your browser from the Quora servers. The .gif that I recorded above shows an example of how a blogger is doing this. She has a pretty lengthy guide on how to set up a blog using Bluehost as your hosting provider, I then switch to one of her monthly income reports where she is reporting over $30,000 in commission from the Bluehost and then I switch to a tool to scan the server IP that her blog is hosted on against public records of the server clusters companies own and it would appear that her blog is actually hosted with Steadfast rather than Bluehost. Before going any further, I just want to point out a few things about this, she doesn't actually say she is using Bluehost herself in her guide, Bluehost may be sub-contracting some of their cloud hosting to Steadfast although most use Amazon or Googles solution these days, Bluehost may have recently purchased the server cluster that Steadfast used to own and the public records for the IP of her server have not updated yet, and EIG who are the parent company of Bluehost may have recently purchased Steadfast and not yet released a press release due to many webmasters jumping ship for other hosting options when EIG acquires a company. On the flipside of this though, she might just be hosting her blog with Steadfast and not want to earn the $20 commission they appear to offer per sign up from the image below when she can push her traffic to Bluehost and get >$65 per sign up.  My advice would be to avoid Bluehost and any of the other EIG front end brand names shown in the image below from their Wikipedia page. Due to EIG buying multiple brands per year, it is probably a good idea to double-check their current brands on their Wikipedia page to see if they have bought your potential new blog host.  EIG has a bad reputation for putting far too many blogs on their hosts to maximize profit that ends up slowing your domain down and causing you issues. On top of this, they have apparently started to charge you for access to the backups that they take if needed where as this is usually a free service. They also have terrible technical customer service for their customers too as shown in the screenshot below back when I had some projects on Hostgator that EIG own. There are multiple reports of their customer service being this bad or even worse.  When they finally transferred me to second-line customer support, they fixed the problem within minutes and it was not due to \u201cThe Hostgator having a cleaning with the servers\u201d, my domain had spiked in system requirements for around a minute so they had locked my hosting account without emailing me to let me know. If I did not check my analytics this could have gone on for days without me knowing and my domain being offline. When it comes to my current hosting, I have about half of my projects with Sitegrounds and half of them with Cloudways. In my experience, both of them are solid hosting companies that EIG has not yet managed to buyout that have great performance and customer service. In my experience, Sitegrounds beats Cloudways by a long shot when it comes to their ease of use and user experience for actually setting your hosting up and navigating around their menu so I would recommend you go with Sitegrounds at the time of writing if you are brand new as it is very simple to set up.  If you are on a very strict budget then the special offers section of the Web Hosting Talk forum offers some very cheap hosting as shown in the screenshot above. That said though, these are very small companies that often go out of business after a few months so if you have to use one of these options you should take daily backups of your blog and look to migrate to something like Sitegrounds as soon as possible. Domain Name I have two domains in my network that are both having the same problem right now, their domain name is just too niche-specific making it very hard to grow their traffic with additional content as I have covered pretty much everything there is to cover. I would always recommend that you choose a broad, general domain name so you don't have this problem and that you are able to keep scaling into new niches and sub-niches to grow your blog. When it comes to your actual domain registrar, so many people recommend GoDaddy but this is a similar situation to Bluehost where they have better affiliate programs. I would recommend Namecheap as you get free WhoIs protection with your domain to prevent people from scanning the ICANN database and getting your email or phone number and spamming you with offers of search engine optimization. Although Whois protection is available with GoDaddy, you have to pay for it and they tried to increase the price of their Whois protection a few years back and got some heavy pushback from the community. Namecheap offer it for free and their domain registrations are at a simile if not cheaper price point to what GoDaddy charge anyway. Content Management System I would highly recommend that you go with self-hosted Wordpress, it has an excellent reputation amongst the community and a huge amount of developers release their own themes and plugins for the platform. This means that anything that you may want to do with your blog can usually easily be done without issue when using Wordpress. Although some compeating content management systems such as Wix and Squarespace do seem to be a little easier when it comes to actually setting your domain up initially, the advantages of Wordpress quickly take over pushing it to the front of the pack. I know multiple people who have initially used Squarespace and Wix with their blogs only to flip to Wordpress, some in less than a month.  You may have to wait 15 to 30 seconds for the .gif above to load on your browser from the Quora servers. Additionally, you see so many people recommending Wix or Squarespace to their readers due to the affiliate commissions those platforms offer. The .gif I made above shows a google search for a comparison of the three options, I scroll down past the ads, select the main ranking article and as you can see, he is scoring Wordpress as only 3.2 with Wix and Squarespace being scored much higher. I then view the page source of the domain and as you can see, his folder structure for his website shows the wp-content directory strongly suggestion that is he actually using the Wordpress content management system to run his own website while recommending Wix and Squarespace to his readers as they offer affiliate programs. The wp-content (wp = Wordpress) is the main user-generated content directory for Wordpress installs in their folder structure on the actual hosting. Although there is a small chance the webmaster has migrated from Wordpress to Wix or Squarespace and it has somehow not migrated them over to their platforms folder structure correctly, I think it is safe to assume that the webmaster is just chasing commissions. Should You Use A Free Or Premium Theme Although many people do chase commissions on this one too, there are some situations where you may require a paid theme for your blog. For the vast majority of people though, especially if you are just starting out, a free theme such as Astra should more than meet your needs. It is the best theme I have ever used for a Wordpress blog by far and I have no plans to use anything else in the future. Although there is a paid version of Astra, the free version is all I use and meets my needs. It is highly customizable, lightning-fast for page load times, and very easy to use so it is ideal for the vast majority of people. Although I have not tried it, I have heard that WPOcean and Generatepress offer similar advantages and perform just as well. Keyword Research If you are wanting to go pull organic search traffic from Google then you have to do keyword research, there are no two ways about it. Although I did not invent this method, I have been developing my own way to pull Google traffic to my blogs using zero search volume keywords that is working very well so far and I would highly recommend it for any beginners out there. As you progress on your blogging journey there are more advanced things that you are able to implement in your keyword research strategy but when you are just starting out, the zero search volume strategy should be enough to get you started on your journey of earning money from blogging. Multiple other people have confirmed that they also use the method too giving me confidence that it will be an ideal option for any beginner bloggers out there. One thing that I would say is that there are multiple paid keyword research tools that range from being less than useless to offering the same data you can get yourself with less control over it. I haven't used a paid keyword research tool in about three years now and I doubt that this is going to change anytime soon. I feel that Google offer you everything that you need right in the search engine results page to get the job done provided that you are willing to put the time in. Publishing Content I see so many people who want to earn a full-time income from blogging but don't want to work fulltime hours. Yes, the more advanced that you become with your blogging strategy the amount of time required to grow your site decreases but for the vast majority of people, the first few years are going to take a large amount of time and effort. In my opinion, anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something for their own gain and don't have your best interests at heart. I know I shared this a day in the life of a blogger video back at the start of the answer but I just wanted to share it again to stress that the vast majority of your workflow is going to be publishing content and growing your blog, not sitting on a beach somewhere. Depending on the type of blog that you plan to build, you can format your content in a number of different ways and it is still highly likley that you will be able to rank in Google and get traffic, especially with the zero search volume strategy that I mentioned above. That said, I go over how I format my own affiliate and display ad articles here that may be helpful if you want to see how I try to format my articles for optional income potential. As you are going to have to spend hours churning content out, I also want to bring your attention to this post where I go over a number of tips and tricks on how you can type up your articles quicker. Even if you only manage to save yourself ten to fifteen minutes per article using those tips, it quickly ads up and allows you to churn out more content on your blogs in a shorter time frame. The Google Sandbox  The screenshot above is of one of my affiliate blogs that made me just over $3000 last month from the Amazon Affiliate program and shows its traffic growth from when I started it back in August 2019 so it is around nine months old right now. As you can see, other than the dip in traffic due to the virus lockdown getting people to panic and change their search habits around the end of March/start of April 2020, it has seen pretty steady weekly growth but definitely shows the effect known as the Google Sandbox where it takes months to get decent traffic. I go into more detail about the Google Sandbox here for anyone that is interested but for the majority of people, just factoring in that you will be unlikely to get serious traffic or income for a domain within four to eight months should be enough for most people. In my experience, this is totally normal and to be expected and is nothing to worry about. I have lost count of the number of people who give up in month two or three before their blog has even been given a chance to get out of the sandbox and start of pull traffic. Although your niche and keyword competition will come into play with this, in my experience, it usually takes 4\u20138 months for a domain to leave the sandbox and see its traffic curve growing but I have seen people say that it has taken as long as 12 months for their projects. Provided you are targeting keywords using the zero search volume strategy, you can probably expect your traffic to start increasing within the first four to eight months of starting your blog if you are new to blogging. I would highly recommend that you plan this into your strategy and don't check your analytics each day for the first six months as the lack of initial growth will just get you down. My advice would be to check your Google Analytics once at the end of each month and then leave it. Site Speed Optimisation  Site speed does come into play for your search engine optimization strategy but I think that many people overemphasize its importance but one of the main benefits of having a fast site with quick load times as shown in the image above is it benefits your user. People are busy and there is some research out there about a high number of people pressing the back button on their browser if your domain failed to load in a certain amount of seconds. Rather than type out a few tips that you can use to help keep your page load times as low as possible, I will just link you to this answer about page load speeds that I made for someone else's Quora question last week. The majority of those steps are quick and easy to implement and can help reduce your page load times. Ways to Monetization When it actually comes to monetizing your blog, you can expect drastically different income levels depending on your monetization methods. As an affiliate blogger, I target higher price point items and usually get between $80 and $130 per 1000 views to my blogs. If you are looking to monetize your traffic with display ads then you can likley expect $3-$5 from something like Google Adsense. That said though, there are premium ad networks out there such as Mediavine and Adthrive that can usually offer a better ad rate for your traffic and can partially go above $20 per 1000 hits depending on your niche and traffic locations. Informational content that you would likley use display ads on does have the advantages of usually having a higher search volume and lower competition level though. This means that on an hour by hour basis for you to actually produce your blog articles, you can potentially offset the lower income potential from display ads for informational content by going for higher search volume topics with less competition. Promotion When it comes to promotion for your blog, I will just link you to this answer that I made to another question on Quora about how you are able to promote your blogs online. That said, the first two-thirds of the answer are very similar to the keyword research method that I linked above. Backlinks If you are wanting to get organic traffic from the search engines then off page SEO is likley going to be important for the higher competition keywords. If you are following the tips in the linked keyword research method above then you may not require them though. I have a blog that was making around $300-$400 a month before the recent Amazon commission changes rolled out and I have never built backlinks to that domain. I also have another affiliate blog that I managed to grow to around $800 a month income before I built backlinks to it too. When it comes to the backlinks types that I build, I usually go with the following:- Guest Posts - Guest posts are basically a brand new article posted on a blog owned by someone else, ideally it will have high domain authority and be relevant to your niche. These are usually used for higher income potential pages with the intent of actually passing link juice from the page I post on to the target page on my blog to help it rank higher in the search engine results page. These usually have keyword-relevant anchor texts as it can offer a minimal benefit to your search engine optimization.Niche Edits - Unlike guest posts that are a brand new post made on someone else's blog, a niche edit is where a webmaster will go back to their existing content and manually add a link to the content on your blog. I use these in the same way I use guest posts to pass link juice to my higher income potential pages and hopefully push them up the search engine results page to get traffic.Manual Forum Posts - Although my testing from one of my recent domains suggests that these actually offer some solid SEO benefit as a stand-alone link type, I initially used them to diversify anchor texts and to increase the total referring domain count to my blog. Due to seeing such positive results from my initial testing with this link type, I still use it to diversify anchor text and referring domains to my projects but I also use them as a stand-alone link type for some of my medium-income potential pages to help pass some link juice.There are a ton of articles out there on how you are able to do manual outreach for guest posts and niche edits but it takes too much time so I usually use an agency and just outsource it. The manual forum posts can be made yourself too if you have the time as they are just posts on high domain authority forums on niche relevant pages to your blog but I outsource these too as they take so much time.

            "answer_text": "There are some basic confusions in this quesiton. Platforms like WordPress or Blogger do not pay. Ad schemes like AdSense do. \"Skewed\" is right. The median blog probably makes $0. There are plenty of people who make 6 figures, but they represent probably less than 1% of the blogosphere. If you want to make 6 figures, you have  to pick your topic very carefully for financial potential rather than personal interest, and work at it with the same 90-hour/week drive you'd put into a six-figure paycheck drive.  If you want to write about something you care about (and it's not a self-indulgent personal journal) the typical topic, if blogged well, can probably mature to a $10,000/year income stream at the 10 hours/week effort level. So about equivalent to a low-paying part-time job.   In other words, this is not a get-rich-quick path. The average blog will take around 2-3 years to mature. The fastest ones can mature in less than a year. The slowest ones may take 4-5 or more years even with the best execution. It all depends on the topic. You can accelerate the growth curve in artificial ways, but you'll pay the costs later (by artificially shortening the natural lifespan of your blog). I prefer what I call slow marketing: growing a blog at its organic, natural and sustainable rate of growth. By this criterion, my blog is a pretty slow-maturing one. It is just starting to mature, 4 years after I started. Another way to interpret this is: if a blog is your escape from the grind, start one a few years before you think you'll need the escape pod.  You should also keep in mind that like any other product, a blog has a natural lifespan depending on topic. I've grown mine with the hope that it will live as long as I myself do. So grow your blog at a rate commensurate with the lifespan expectation. If you think the niche will disappear in 2 years, it is stupid to plan a 4-year growth path. Try and optimize for NPV lifetime revenue, not isolated months or time-to-maturity.  There are two broad revenue types, direct and indirect. Direct income derives directly from blog content and requires no additional marketing effort. Indirect uses the blog as a marketing channel for other revenue, and requires conversion costs. In general, direct is much smaller than indirect. I'd say around 20% or less. There are categories where that can be reversed. Direct Direct is a fairly well-understood formula by now. You still have to think, tweak and optimize, but mostly it is execution and avoiding dumb mistakes. The hard part isn't the \"make money\" part here. It is writing (or drawing or podcasting) quality stuff week after week. In the direct game, 90% of success, as Woody Allen said, is just showing up.  For the make-money part, if you are smart, this answer plus a couple of months reading a site like problogger.net is enough. If you like more structured advice, a Dummies book should do it. If you like being spoon-fed, there are plenty of make-money-blogging online courses out there.  The top few, in reverse order of lucrativeness for me personally:  CPC: The baseline way to make money is AdSense. It took me 2 years to get to my first $100 paycheck from Google AdSense. Then 6 months to make my second $100. Then I turned the thing off. It isn't worth it unless you are writing something like a blog about a lucrative product category like digital cameras or the drug industry. You have to experiment to find out whether it is worth it for your blog. AdSense is the major cpc channel. There are others. Be aware that running prominent ads annoys readers, so there is a definite tradeoff.CPM: cpm ads are far less popular at the low end and in fact I don't know of any automated one you can sign up for. I've run a few for about $50 a month each on a few popular posts. The advertisers sought me out. That's typically how this works. Once you hit a certain size, people will start reaching out to you with offers. Most are worthless. Some are fine. This is really worth it only for a very high traffic blog. Or for high traffic corners of medium traffic blogs. Beyond a point, if you want to do it this way, you need to go solicit ads from the right advertisers directly. Relying on the middlemen to find you gets you too little money. I had no energy and haven't pushed this.Tips: I use the \"Buy me a beer\" plugin for wordpress (set to \"coffee\" instead of \"beer\"). There are many other such tipping-based schemes. This is my favorite because the psychology (\"buy me a beer\" instead of \"make a donation\") is done right and is 3x more effective according to the plugin-author's stats. This brings in $30 or so on a good month, $100-$300 in months where I have a viral hit.Affiliate: This is the only channel I've truly stuck with, and only Amazon.com. This channel has grown with my blog, and these days I get somewhere between $80 - $200/month on average. This is because one category (books) is very well-aligned with my site. You have to experiment a lot to hit paydirt here. A friend pulls in more than $1000, also from Amazon. Be aware that currently in California, this program is suspended due to some wrangling between Amazon and the state government. To explore a broader array of affiliate schemes, try shareasale.com. I had no success with it.Sponsorship: You can rig up simple paypal buttons or Amazon donation widgets to ask directly for sponsorship. This is only worth doing once you get feedback from readers that shows that there is significant reader loyalty and trust. They have to believe that you are writing for the sake of writing rather than for other motives. My sponsor page is here: http://www.ribbonfarm.com/sponsor/ ...for 2011, I've gotten nearly $2000 so far. I'll reset the clock in 2012. Think of this as the NPR/PBS approach. Only works if you handle your blog like NPR/PBS.Other: There are other direct channels I've made a conscious choice to not use. The most important one is simply the freemium model, with a \"member's only community\" and extra content. I am fine with this for high-value commodity content (news) or transactional types of content (teaching for example), but for most types of content I think this goes against the spirit of blogging and also makes very little marketing sense. You annoy readers, create an artificial barrier between paying/free members (remember, the value of a reader has almost nothing to do with how much they pay, and everything to do with the thoughtfulness of their commenting, the sincerity and enthusiasm of their support in word-of-mouth, etc.). I do like a version of this though... paid events.I think it is very important to get the direct revenues up as high as possible: it is income insurance of sorts. And the content turns out far better if you try to make it pay for itself (otherwise it inevitably slides down the slippery slope from intrinsic value to content-marketing to open shilling for customers for other products/services). Try to get at least 15% of total revenues directly. Indirect Indirect is harder and more lucrative. The potential upside is limitless, and at some point the blogging might even become a dispensable sideshow. But if you dive into indirect, you're no longer just a blogger. You are running a small business, and have to think like an entrepreneur. A bootstrapped-entrepreneur who happens to be starting with a live sales channel instead of a paper napkin and a pitch deck, but an entrepreneur nevertheless. See Venkatesh Rao's answer to Is it hard to build, market, and maintain a web app that makes at least $1,000 a month for a single, skilled web developer? to understand how to get into this mindset.  I am a relative novice at the indirect game. I've made decent money off 1, 4 and 5. I've done, but not made any money at, 2. I've not yet attempted 3 or 6.   Books: I've written a book. One of the most rewarding things you can do in your life. Financially (especially if you self-publish), spiritually, market-strategically.Speaking/Workshops: I've done a few events. It's a whole other game. A successful blog is your ticket into Level 1 of this game, but then you have to learn this game as well.Teaching: Done well, this is probably the most accessible and lucrative ways to make money off a blog. If you offer a course, virtual or in real life, anywhere from an afternoon to several weeks, you can make lots of money. If you are willing to prey on the gullible, you can practically mint money with feel-good motivational/12-step/get-rich-quick type content. I unfortunately have higher ethical standards than is probably sensible, given my financial situation, and therefore haven't yet come up with anything I'd feel comfortable charging for. I am playing around with a few ideas.Freelance Writing: A blog is evidence that you can really build an audience. At some point, you'll have enough evidence that the freelance writing offers will start coming in. You should get a sense of your writing speed (finished words/hour) and convert everything into a per-word rate. The money can range from less than minimum wage on the low end to probably about $2/word at the high-end (web celebrity, not real-life celebrity, which is worth far more). Most clients pay per post. Some pay per word. Some pay per hour. You can get into this game today and make money immediately if you start with the content farming industry, but that is an extremely dumb thing to do. Freelancing is only worth doing, money-wise and satisfaction-wise (i.e. if you want to actually enjoy the gigs) if your own self-branded writing has a certain amount of validated popularity so you can charge a premium over other equally skilled writers. Even if you don't want your own blog at all (there are no good reasons for a writer to take this position IMO; it's like saying \"I don't want a personal bank account\"), it makes better sense to write quality stuff as an unpaid guest blogger than to write SEO-bait for the content farms. Even if you are destitute and hungry, you should probably try panhandling before writing for content farms. The pay is comparable if you can panhandle with a decent tearjerker pitch.Consulting: this is the most loosely connected channel. The blog serves as a lead generation mechanism and lowers your marketing costs considerably (in business terms, I'd say SAG for a general consulting business probably runs around 25%; with a blog, if the blogging makes enough direct revenue, the lead-generation function is merely a nice free side-effect, and your SAG falls to maybe 10%).Products: your blog's success may, upon analysis, turn out to represent market demand for things beyond writing. In other words, it may be pull evidence for products that don't yet exist. You can partner, or by yourself, produce those products and sell 'em to a ready-made audience. This is basic line extension. This has to be very carefully done, since you may misinterpret your blog's brand position with respect to that demand. If your brand is about unbiased reviews of digital cameras, and you end up with great ideas for the design of a really good new digital camera, you'll have to choose: do you want to give up the brand equity associated with unbiased reviews in order to throw your lot in with one camera? In other cases, things are simpler. If you write about personal financial management and offer a freemium calculator around your own ideas, that should be a natural line extension of the brand.I'll stop here.  Beyond this, you're no longer talking about bloggers, but about general entrepreneurs. ",

            "answer_text": "Many answers that I read here were dedicated to the point that you have to get traffic and then things are going to go smoothly. However, I have begun to understand that collecting visitors without knowing why you are doing it is rather wrong. You don\u2019t want just any audience but a dedicated one, who will follow your projects and support endeavors. So start by thinking what is the higher purpose of the blog: do you want to sell some product or service, or maybe starting a company? Think about business goals, not just traffic ones (therefore, plan not to have 10K visitors but 10K clients or patrons). I stop on ways to monetize the audience you already collected, if you are interested in tips on collecting traffic, there are many good answers already. What is the way to monetize this audience? Patreon Many writers and bloggers struggle with a question: \u2018What to do if my work is not business-oriented but rather creative? I don\u2019t want to sell any products, I just want to write about what I love and earn money. I have readers but I want to convert it all into money\u2019. The way to pull it off is to register on a specially created platform where creators can get paid. I discovered Patreon just recently and was fascinated by it - so many creators are actually supported for what they do. So if you have an audience but just need to convert visitors to patrons, you know where to go. Sell backlinks If your blog is popular, you can take initiative in your hands and contact authors of unpopular blogs with offers of backlinks. Make sure, the topics are relevant to yours, otherwise, you\u2019ll be punished by Google algorithms. Don\u2019t wait for people to contact you about advertising, take initiative in your hands and start looking for potential clients. Sell ads in social media Same as with backlinks, you can contact people who just have new communities and are in need of advertising. Start by doing a post where you say that your community publishes ads (if that\u2019s allowed by the rules of the site) and start contacting people on your own. Of course, there are many other tips but these are the ones you can do literally today. So good luck and just do it! ",

Don\u2019t let the \u2018successful\u2019 blogs fool you. Don\u2019t let the blogging gurus convince you otherwise. To make even a moderate amount of money, it will take you heroic amounts of time and effort to make enough sideline money, never mind main money as a livelihood. Those with extremely good topic focus \u2014 and usually a nose for trends \u2014 will have a better chance. In short, you need talent to make money from blogging. A lot of the \u2018how\u2019 is from some kind of advertising or using AdSense or that kind of thing. Yet somebody\u2019s got to click the wretched ad for something to happen.Then there\u2019s affiliate marketing, which to me is like a joint venture with somebody. What's the orher person selling?Then there\u2019s the old standby of the blog being a front end to a real business selling actual products \u2014 at least this one isn\u2019t selling smoke and pitching fumes.Otherwise, the rest of us (and probably you too because of the necessity of you asking the question) will have to put in the traditional hard work and long hours. And those things don\u2019t necessarily lead to any kind of moderate money-earning success. \u201cBut there are lots of bloggers out there making $50,000 a year! C\u2019mon.\u201d Really? How many? Let\u2019s say 5,000 such bloggers. You might have a superstar blogger as your neighbour too. Depending on what statistics we use (or believe in), there are 980 million websites on the Internet. Out of those, some 100\u2013180 million blog sites, producing roughly 3\u20134 million fresh posts every day. What\u2019s 5,000 profitable blogs out of 100\u2013180 million blogs, right? We draw our own conclusions. ",

            "answer_text": "How I Made My First $200 With My Blog  Step # 1: Picked A Topic I Both Was Interested In and Enjoy The website that I created was on an issue that touched home to me and that affected many other people. It started out simply as a blog for me to express my thoughts on a certain societal issue. I wrote a few articles and posted some of my answer on Quora (Quora is a great place to get traffic for your website) and in just a manner of a day or two, my website was getting hundreds of views a day. And all, just from Quora. Step number one create a blog around something that you talk about on a daily basis. It will make your blogs or articles much more relatable and you will be amazed at how many people will share your work thus increasing your traffic on a daily basis. Step # 2: Pinterest Is Your Best Friend Quora is a great place to get traffic and to also build a substantial following. I am peaking in at around 1.1 K followers with one of my Quora accounts. And it has been less than two months!!!! Pinterest however, will be the steroid injection to your blog. By creating captivating and inserting pins you can drive an insane amount of traffic to your blog. Step # 3: Google Ads Lastly the way that I monetized my website was through Google Adsense. For the first two weeks I was earning around a few pennies a day. Until the 30th of June where I made $6.10 cents.  That may not seem like a lot \u2014 but the going from pennies to dollars was a huge surprise to me. I had soon realized that the reason I was making pennies a day before (to which I now make dollars and it\u2019s growing) was because of how I was using the google ads.  When you create your blog make sure that you go for Native Content Ads. I was only using the Display ads and that was really cutting into my earnings for a day. By placing ads in your article you will be able to potentially get more clicks. The ads you will want to use is the ad with the yellow icon floating. To Monetize Your Site To monetize your site from Google Adsense you must have a purchased domain.

            "answer_text": "To get started it is always a good idea to set up your own blog if you want to freelance.  You can build up a portfolio of articles and people can see your writing style. You can write sample articles that you can send to prospects via a web links.  This is good for people to get a better feeling for your personality and the way you write. Some companies are very specific in the type of writing style they are looking for. It may be frivolous, humorous or deadpan serious. Write how you normally write. Do NOT try and fake it as that will make the job of creating content much harder if you have to write in a specific style that is not familiar to you.  If you do not want to go to the trouble of finding your own business and contacting companies directly, although it is the most profitable, then you can sign up for one of the many  online writing services or outsourcing companies like upwork. The benefit is that they do the marketing and bring in the business for you.  The downside is that a lot of time you might not get the recognition which is not helpful if you want to build your own reputation and a name for yourself in the industry.  You can go direct to companies or websites that are in the industry that you can or enjoy writing about, but this is a hard slog and again, without a few reviews and a history it can be even tougher to get your first big gig.  The key is to offer to write for free or a reduced rate for these websites and companies and, once you have proven yourself, then you can ramp up the price.  If you have a particular skill set or knowledge in technical fields like medicine, health and fitness, trading  or legal for example then that would help you get higher paid work faster.  Upwork - I mentioned earlier, this is a very large outsourcing website. n up and add your profile, skills, qualifications, experience and the service you want to offer.  You can then either search and apply for gigs or wait for them to find you. The former will produce mush faster results but take a bit of time and, as there are a lot of people on the site, it can take a few knock backs before you get the job.  One last tip but a very important one.  Try to specialise in a certain topic or area. You will find it much easier to get work if you let people know that you are a specialist in Dog training or stock market trading.  People are not looking for a \"jack of all trades and master of none\", they want to believe that they have someone on their team who really has an in depth knowledge in their industry and they can trust you to get on with it.  Choose a niche and work with that until you crack it.  If you do want to write in different niches then it might be worth creating different profiles for each niche or subject you want to write about.  Good luck :-) ",

            "answer_text": "How to Start a Blog That Generates $3817 a Month in 2020 Something big has been happening in the world of work. How is it possible that so many people, from all walks of life and all ages, are creating blogs and entire businesses online? Can blobs of text, blended with a series of images really possess superpowers? And, honestly, how many people want to read the scattered thoughts of an average person like you or me? This blog you\u2019re reading gets over 2,436,112 unique visitors a year and generates well over a million dollars a year in revenue. Just look at my revenue stats for a 30 day period:  $381,772 a month is a lot of money\u2026 especially for a blog. Now you aren\u2019t going to generate that much money, but it is realistic for you to make 1/100th of what I am making. Today I\u2019d like to give you every single step that you need to follow to create a blog, growing it AND learning how to monetize it in just 47 minutes. So let\u2019s get started and go over how to make a blog and teach you how to become a blogger. Step 1. Unleash ideas within you If you want to create a blog, you don\u2019t need a revolutionary idea. But, your blog should be focused on something specific. Remember that no idea, no matter how good, is truly unique. But, you have unique experiences. You have a distinct voice. And, you probably have a vibrant personality that will attract others like your family and friends. When it comes to choosing your blog\u2019s niche, there are 2 key questions to ask yourself. 1. Do I enjoy learning about this topic? If you don\u2019t love the topic, it\u2019ll show in your writing. You shouldn\u2019t even start a blog if you don\u2019t love what you\u2019re blogging about. Whatever topic you pick, you need to love it, and naturally curious about it. If not, you\u2019ll run out of ideas quickly. Most importantly, you won\u2019t be able to consistently create content that will build your audience. If you are still lost, think about what your family and friends come to you for when seeking advice? It might be fitness, recipes or relationship advice. You know best. 2. Are there others who are interested in the same things? You might feel like the only 23-year-old who\u2019s obsessed with knitting. But, there are others out there. Do a quick Google search and you\u2019ll find 539,000 results aimed at people just like you.  You might be wondering if your idea is too quirky. Or, maybe it\u2019s too broad? If you want to start a travel blog, stay away from generic words like \u201ctravel.\u201d Choose a more specific topic, like \u201cbackpacking.\u201d I can give you a million examples, but it\u2019s better if I show you. Enter a keyword below and you\u2019ll have a data-backed answer right away. Step 2: Name your blog and get web hosting This is a fun and important step, because your blog name is your brand. It\u2019s how you\u2019ll be remembered. But, don\u2019t overthink it. The key is to take action and gain momentum. When you\u2019re starting a blog from scratch, you need two things. The first is a domain name. This is your blog\u2019s name. For example, mine is knowledge central.com Domain names will run you roughly $10/year but you can get a free domain when you signup for hosting with Bluehost. If you don\u2019t find the right domain name, no worries you can still start a blog and change your name later. The second is web hosting. Web hosting is a service that allows your blog to be accessed through the internet. Without web hosting, your blog can\u2019t be seen online. Without a domain name, your blog won\u2019t have an address. The two are inseparable. There are plenty of web hosting companies to choose from. Prices generally range from $3 \u2013 $1000/month. If you\u2019re just starting a new blog, you should use Bluehost. They are the biggest and most well-known hosting company.  Bluehost Best Web Hosting Company Get a free domain name and the best web hosting for your blog at Bluehost. Signup Now To be honest, you really don\u2019t need anything fancy at this stage. Once you hit over 25,000 unique visitors a month, you can consider upgrading, but Bluehost can scale with you. When naming your blog, you may want to take these tips into consideration. Choose a .com over others. They\u2019re easier to remember.Aim for 2-3 words. Unfortunately, most, if not all single word domains are taken.Try to use a keyword that represents what your blog is about. This helps people quickly identify your blog\u2019s niche and helps search engines distinguish what your blog is about.Avoid using numbers and hyphens. They are difficult to remember.Go for something memorable or catchy.For personal brands, use your name or a variation of it.Try the tool below and see if your domain name is available. If it\u2019s unavailable, you\u2019ll get some relevant suggestions. Search for your Domain Name http://godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search It might take some effort to find the perfect name for your blog, but it\u2019s worth the thought and effort when starting a new brand. Step 3. Install WordPress \u2013 your blogging software You can\u2019t start a blog without blogging software. I run all of my blogs on WordPress because it\u2019s user-friendly, free and powerful. If you decide to make a blog that\u2019s not on WordPress you\u2019ll find that it is much more costly as WordPress offers thousands of free plugins that allows you to modify your blog in any way, shape or form. Even without a technical bone in your body, you can install WordPress in exactly 5 clicks. Here\u2019s how. After you get your free domain and hosting account, you can log in and use your first click on the \u201cInstall WordPress\u201d icon.  Choose the \u201cdo it yourself\u201d version and click the \u201cInstall\u201d button.  Use your third click on the \u201cCheck Domain\u201d button.  Your last two clicks will be for acknowledging their terms of service and finalizing your install.  Within a minute, you\u2019ll have a fully functional WordPress blog up and running. Step 4. Design your blog with a WordPress theme In the blogging world, WordPress designs are called themes. Out of the box, your blog will look something like this:  It isn\u2019t the fanciest design out there, but it\u2019s workable. There are thousands of themes to choose from. But, it can be easy to get trapped in \u201cShiny Object Syndrome\u201d and not walk away with anything. You can swap out your theme any time, so don\u2019t get too caught up with the bells and whistles. First, you need to log into your WordPress admin. You can access this by going to Best Website Builder Online | Your site. Here, you\u2019ll need to enter your user credentials to log in.  If you\u2019re new to WordPress, the dashboard might look a little daunting at first, but you\u2019ll be an expert with a little practice.  To install a new theme, hover over the \u201cAppearance\u201d menu in the sidebar and click \u201cThemes.\u201d  WordPress comes with a few themes \u2013 their \u201cTwenty-[Year]\u201d themes. Instead, we\u2019ll search for flashier themes that will instantly make your eyes twinkle. Click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button at the top to get access to thousands of WordPress themes.  Your taste and mine might be different. Fortunately, WordPress has a \u201cFeature Filter\u201d that lets you search for something that will fit your style.  The 3 categories are \u201clayout,\u201d \u201cfeatures\u201d and \u201csubject.\u201d Here\u2019s what your filter requests might look like.  After applying the filters, you\u2019ll see amazing themes that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars in design fees. Since I like you, it\u2019s free \ud83d\ude09  If you click on the theme\u2019s thumbnail, you can get an instant preview of what your blog will look like. Evaluate if it fits both your personal style and the topic that you\u2019ll be covering. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the sneak peek, click the \u201cInstall\u201d button.  Once the installation is complete, click the \u201cActivate\u201d button and you\u2019re all set. If you can\u2019t find a theme that you like, there are premium themes that you can purchase from sites like: Themeforest.Elegant Themes.StudioPress.Thrive Themes.By now, your theme should be activated and ready to go. Let\u2019s move on to customizing your theme.  Step 5. Customize and optimize your WordPress blog There are endless customizations that you can make on a WordPress blog. We\u2019ll stick with the essentials. Themes are the foundation of your design and include the core functionalities. WordPress also has plugins that can add to or extend the functionality of your blog. For example, you can use plugins to add forums, contact forms or sliders. While they might seem like basic features, they aren\u2019t always available by default. The first step is to click the \u201cCustomize\u201d button on your active theme.  Menu options in the sidebar will vary, depending on the theme you choose. The main category to edit is \u201cSite Identity.\u201d  Here, you can add the name of your blog and a tagline if you wish. When you\u2019re done, click the \u201cSave and Publish\u201d button.  Optimize for Search Engine Traffic Search engine optimization (SEO) is a multi-billion dollar industry. SEO is the process of optimizing your website to be found in search engines for particular keywords and phrases. I attribute a good portion of my success to being easily discoverable for relevant search terms, which has helped me build my networks and net worth. If you\u2019re new to SEO, then this new feat may seem daunting. But, WordPress makes it insanely simple to optimize the technical aspects of your blog. The majority of your SEO efforts will be to create engaging content for real people. Whether that\u2019s through text, videos, or images, your job as a blogger is to spark a relationship with your readers. And, what better way is there than through relatable and informative conversation? You can get started by downloading a plugin called Yoast SEO. Hover over the plugins menu on the side and click \u201cAdd New.\u201d  Search for \u201cYoast SEO\u201d in the search bar and it will be the first result that comes up. Click the \u201cInstall Now\u201d button. Then, hit the \u201cActivate\u201d button once the installation is complete.  You can access the plugin\u2019s settings from the new SEO menu in the sidebar or by clicking the icon at the top.  From the dashboard, go to \u201cYour Info\u201d and set the foundations for your blog.  Make sure that your website name and tagline are correct. Then, identify yourself as a company or person. Click the \u201cSave Changes\u201d button and we\u2019ll move on to the next step.  Next, go to the \u201cWebmaster Tools\u201d tab and click \u201cGoogle Search Console.\u201d Google Search Console is a webmaster tool that allows you to submit your site to their search index and optimize visibility.  Sign into your Google account, whether that\u2019s your Gmail or Drive account.  Once you\u2019ve logged in, click the \u201cAlternate methods\u201d tab and select \u201cHTML tag.\u201d  A new drop-down will appear with your search console meta code. Copy the alphanumeric string without the quotation marks.  Next, paste your meta code into the Google Search Console text box and click \u201cSave Changes.\u201d  Finally, click the \u201cVerify\u201d button.  As you tinker around in Webmaster Central, you\u2019ll gain a wealth of data-driven insight, such as keyword phrases you rank for, errors on your blog and the ability to give Google a nudge when you publish a new post. Next, go to the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab and start the installation wizard.  Yoast will take you through a series of 10 quick steps to optimize your WordPress blog. The first step is a welcome screen that you can skip. In the second step, select the environment that best suits your site. Most likely, you\u2019ll choose the production environment, which means that it is a real website that you intend on driving traffic to.  Step 3 is the website type. Choose blog and click next.  The next step is to set yourself up as a company or person. We already set this up before, so you can skip this step.  In step 5, you can add any social profiles that are associated with your blog. Click \u201cNext\u201d when complete. Step 6 is about post visibility. The default settings are fine to use. Set your \u201cPosts\u201d and \u201cPages\u201d to visible and \u201cMedia\u201d to hidden.  Next, you\u2019ll have to decide whether you\u2019ll have multiple authors or a solo blogger. If you choose to add another writer in the future, you can change these settings later.  If you wish to have the Yoast SEO plugin pull in data from Google\u2019s search console, step 8 is the place to do it. Click on the \u201cGet Google Authorization Code\u201d button.  A new pop-up will appear where you can allow Yoast to access your search console data. Click the \u201cAllow\u201d button to confirm access.  In step 9, you can verify your website name and choose a title separator. The title separator is a symbol used to separate your blog post\u2019s title and your website\u2019s name in the meta title information. This is what Google searchers will see when finding your blog through a search query. For instance, if you found this post in Google, you might have saw \u201cHow to Start a Blog \u2013 Neil Patel.\u201d The symbol is a matter of personal preference. Click \u201cNext\u201d when you\u2019re ready to move on.  The final step is no step at all. It\u2019s a congratulatory message confirming that you have successfully optimized your SEO settings for your budding WordPress blog. XML Sitemaps The last Yoast SEO setting worth configuring is an XML sitemap. An XML sitemap is a file that lists the URLs for your website. It helps Google and other search engines crawl your site for new posts and pages. Fortunately, Yoast has a built-in feature that automatically updates your sitemap, so you can click it and forget it. In the \u201cFeatures\u201d tab, set the \u201cAdvanced settings pages\u201d to \u201cEnabled\u201d and save the changes.  A new group of menus will appear in the sidebar, under \u201cSEO.\u201d Select the \u201cXML Sitemaps\u201d menu.  Select the \u201cUser Sitemap\u201d tab and toggle \u201cAuthor / user sitemap\u201d to enabled. Don\u2019t forget to save your changes.  You can play around with these settings endlessly, but everything that we\u2019ve set up to this point will get you started on the right track. Set up permalinks: Permalinks are static hyperlinks that lead to a particular blog post or page. By default, WordPress sets your permalinks to Best Website Builder Online | Yoursite.  In no way is this sexy and it doesn\u2019t help anyone understand what the page is about before viewing it. The simple fix is to set a permalink structure. In the left sidebar, mouse-over \u201cSettings\u201d and choose \u201cPermalinks.\u201d  There are a few options to choose from. I use the \u201cPost name\u201d structure on my blog which uses keywords from my title to create a unique permalink.  Save the settings after you\u2019ve selected it. You\u2019ll see this in action a bit later. If you\u2019re still with me, you\u2019ve purchased your domain and web hosting, installed a theme and optimized your website to be crawled and found by search engines. Now, we get to the bread and butter of blogging. What are you going to write about in your blog? Let\u2019s find out. Step 6. Brainstorm blog topics On the technical side, your blog is all set up and ready to go. When it comes to topic generation, the world is your oyster. The majority of your blog posts will come from personal experiences, passions, successes, failures and new learnings. People use questions as search queries, like: What should I write about?What to blog about?Should I start blogging?So naturally, you should start off with some questions of your own. I use a series of questions and a systematic process to come up with my blog topic ideas. No need to worry. It\u2019s not complicated and it won\u2019t take very much time. By following this process, you should be able to come up with about 50 working topics within a half hour of distraction-free time. Pull out a pen and paper or open up your favorite word processing tool. The goal of this exercise is to get 10 answers for each question. If you can think of more, note them all. It\u2019s time to look through the lens of your readers with these 5 questions. 1. \u201cWhat excites, intrigues or stirs passion in my readers?\u201d Examples: As a golfer, I get excited by hitting my driver farther. I\u2019m fascinated by mental performance. I\u2019m passionate about healthy living.As a new stay-at-home mom, I get excited by budget-friendly ideas for the family. I\u2019m intrigued by sleep-training. I\u2019m passionate about homeschooling.As an avid camper, I get excited about finding undervalued camping sites. I\u2019m intrigued by survival tactics. I\u2019m passionate about minimalist living.2. \u201cWhat are common challenges my readers go through?\u201d Examples: Golfers might struggle with slicing the ball.Stay-at-home moms may find meal planning challenging.Campers might struggle with packing light.3. \u201cWhat character traits do my readers possess? Example: Serious golfers have emotional stability.Moms are patient and have a sense of humor.Campers are adventurous and resourceful.4. \u201cWhat do your readers love about your niche?\u201d Example: Golfers love the challenge of perfection.Stay-at-home moms love being a part of their child\u2019s mental, physical and emotional development.Campers love time away from the busy city life.5. \u201cWhat do your readers hate about your niche?\u201d Examples: Golfers hate playing with partners who complain all day long.Stay-at-home moms hate being looked down on by others.Campers hate getting eaten alive.You get the point. Now that you have about 50 answers, you can begin dissecting blog post ideas from each answer. The sky is the limit. Here are a few examples you can extract from one answer in your list: Cure Your Slice: The Foolproof Guide To Hit The Fairway Every Time3 Reasons Why You\u2019re Slicing The Ball And One Stupid Simple FixNever Slice Again: 9 Drills To Play Like The Pros7 Training Aids For Dead Straight Ball FlightHow To Shoot Even Par With A Nasty Slice.Try to come up with a catchy headline that will draw your readers in and then throw them a one-two punch in the rest of your content. Step 7. Write your first masterpiece WordPress uses an intuitive editor, similar to your favorite word processing tools. New entries are created directly from your WordPress admin. Click on \u201cPosts\u201d in the left sidebar.  This will populate a list of your blog entries in descending order. Since we\u2019re working with a fresh install, you won\u2019t see anything here. To create a new entry, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button at the top or in the sidebar.  You\u2019ll be brought to the editor and you can begin blogging.  Click the \u201cToolbar Toggle\u201d icon to get a few more editing options to spruce up your posts. The new tools are especially useful when creating subheadings throughout your articles.  First things first. Add one of the titles that you developed in your brainstorming session in the title text box. Immediately after, WordPress will create a permalink based on the keywords used in your title.  You can start typing the body of your article in the large text area and write until you feel happy with your content.  You\u2019ll want to add visual assets to your blog posts as well. Images help engage readers and can often illustrate concepts better than words. To add new images, ensure that your text cursor is in the place where you want your image to appear. Click the \u201cAdd Media\u201d button.  Now, drag and drop your image file into the media box.  After your image has uploaded, select your image and click the \u201cInsert into post\u201d button. You can format sizes and add hyperlinks to your images if you wish.  Your image will automatically insert into your post. Here\u2019s what your post will look like.  After you\u2019ve completed your article, you\u2019ll need to make a few last minute optimizations using the Yoast SEO plugin. Yoast has post specific settings that can be found immediately under the main text area. The 4 main settings are \u201cSEO title,\u201d\u201cslug,\u201d \u201cmeta description\u201d and \u201cfocus keyword.\u201d Completing these settings will generate a preview of what your post will look like when it is discovered in Google\u2019s search engine results. Create SEO titles that are attractive to click and meta descriptions that explain what your post is about. The Yoast SEO plugin will provide real-time feedback, as you begin to optimize your title and description.  Aim for as many green lights as possible, but don\u2019t stress if you\u2019re unable to get a perfect score. If you can get 80% green lights, then you\u2019re on the right track.  Finally, if your blog has thumbnails, you should set a featured image. Featured images are thumbnails that appear above each post. You can set your featured image by clicking on \u201cSet featured image\u201d at the bottom of the right sidebar.  The media window will pop-up, and it\u2019s just a matter of dragging and dropping your photo. Once the upload is complete, click the \u201cSet featured image\u201d button.  Before you publish your post, you can view what your blog post will look like by clicking the \u201cpreview\u201d button at the top of the page.  Before you hit that publish button, you want to make sure that your entry looks and feels the way that you want it to. Here\u2019s a quick checklist to consider, before you hit the publish button: Speak in a conversational tone.Content flows naturally.Easy on the eyes with adequate white space.Use headings to separate sections.Bullet points and lists.Check for typos and grammatical errors.If everything checks out, you\u2019re ready to publish your first blog post. Scroll to the top of the page and click the publish button to post immediately.  And, here\u2019s what my final post looks like.  Congratulations. You\u2019ve successfully set up a blog that looks great and is optimized for search engine traffic. Feels good right? Step 8. Create an editorial calendar One of the fatal mistakes I see bloggers make is to blog only when they \u201cfeel like it.\u201d They forget that new fans want more content and they fail to deliver. Unforeseen circumstances will arise. You\u2019ll let a new Netflix series take over the time that you could have spent blogging. Life will continue to throw curveballs at you, whether you start blogging or not. Consistency is undervalued and it needs to be something you prioritize. I\u2019ve written over a thousand articles and it\u2019s not because I type 7,000 words per minute. It\u2019s because I follow an editorial calendar without compromise. Schedules aren\u2019t just for big publications like The New York Times and the Huffington Post. They\u2019re for regular people like you and me. Think about it like this. If you have a doctor\u2019s appointment in your calendar or even a lunch date with a friend, you\u2019re going to honor it. Worst case scenario, you\u2019ll reschedule for the next available time-slot. Editorial calendars work in a similar fashion. They make aggressive goals reachable in micro steps. They keep you organized. They streamline your social media and email marketing efforts. And, you\u2019ll be surprised at how an editorial calendar can even help you grow in character and integrity. We are creatures of habit. The better you keep your dates, the faster you\u2019ll grow your audience. So, how do you get started and how much will it cost? Nada. Just open up a new Excel spreadsheet. If you have multiple writers, you can share the sheet using Google drive. Start with four columns \u2013 Publishing Date, Title, Keyword and Notes.  Your needs might be different than mine, so feel free to add additional columns as needed. Common additions might include \u201cAuthor,\u201d\u201dCategory\u201d and \u201cPersona.\u201d The simpler you keep it, the easier it will be to digest and follow. Look through your calendar on your iPhone, Android or the one hanging on your fridge. How often can you post? Monthly? Weekly? Daily? Be conservative with your goals, because consistently missing deadlines can lead to quitting altogether. Next, go through the answers that you came up with in your brainstorming session and add them under the \u201cTitle\u201d column. Your titles don\u2019t need to be perfect yet. Throw in a working headline that you can spruce up before publishing. Sometimes, the best headlines come after you\u2019ve written your article. You\u2019ll have a crystal clear picture of what your story is about and who it is for. The \u201cKeyword\u201d column is intended for SEO purposes. If you\u2019re targeting specific keyword phrases that you\u2019d like to rank for, add those in there. If nothing comes to mind, you can do some keyword research later on. Finally, there\u2019s the \u201cNotes\u201d column. This section is a perfect place to write down brilliant ideas that come to mind. Notes also act as a great tool to stay focused on the topic at hand and tackle it coherently. You should be able to write up a set of 25 blog post topics with deadlines that you\u2019re confident about keeping. That\u2019s almost half a year\u2019s worth of blog posts for a weekly writer. Okay. You have the editorial, but you\u2019re still missing the calendar. Go to Google Calendars and set up a new calendar. You can do this by clicking the down arrow to the right of \u201cMy Calendars.\u201d  Click \u201cCreate New Calendar\u201d and add a name, description and time zone. You can share this calendar with other participants on your team. If you don\u2019t have team members, share it with your spouse or a good friend who is willing to keep you accountable to your goals.  After you\u2019ve filled out the essential information, click \u201cCreate Calendar\u201d and get acquainted with your new best friend. Make sure that your calendar is selected in the left sidebar and change your schedule view to weekly.  Click on a time slot under a day and add your blog post title as the \u201cEvent Title.\u201d I recommend that you set a notification for a couple of days before the publishing date.  If you only write whenever it\u2019s convenient, you\u2019re heading down a dangerous road. You\u2019ll eventually run out of ideas, lose motivation and forget about the drive you once had to start your own blog. Editorial calendars are a quick fix for a blogger\u2019s procrastination. Step 9. Monetize your blog. The last step is to monetize your blog. You may not have a desire to monetize your blog immediately. If that\u2019s you, then it\u2019s a good thing. Hear me out. Conventional styles of selling looked something like this: Think of an idea.Create a product.Try and sell the product.File for bankruptcy.This method has been unsuccessful for so many individuals and businesses, because they didn\u2019t build an audience before creating it. They based market demand off \u201cgut feelings.\u201d And, that\u2019s why blogging is the perfect channel for monetization. You can build an audience through various mediums, like your email newsletter, blog comments and social media channels. Ask your audience Blogging allows people into your life. If you think of your favorite bloggers, you might feel like you know them on a somewhat personal level. Also, your market research becomes significantly easier. I ask questions at the end of my blog posts that generate hundreds of comments.  Alternatively, you can also send email blasts with a survey, using Google Forms, to gain valuable information on what your target audience wants. By building a blog, you open doors to talk with potential customers. People who will give you honest feedback on what they want from you. If 90% of your survey respondents tell you that they want a formal course on digital marketing, then what do you think they want? A digital marketing course that they will pay for. Make money with advertisements If you don\u2019t want to sell a physical product or service, you can do what other publishers are doing. Sell advertising space. Anyone can put an ad on their blog using Google Adsense. But, the real money comes from private sales of ad placements. If you build a high traffic blog, you can make a full-time income selling ad spots on your website to large corporations. The only thing that you need to do is to add their banner and keep doing what you do best \u2013 write about your passion or expertise. Sell physical products Another avenue I explored is in the nutrition niche. Mike and I built a blog from scratch and transformed it into a $100,000/month blog selling a private label fish oil supplement on Amazon.  Our success was mainly due to our blog. We published great content, understood our audience\u2019s needs and directed them to our Amazon sales page. The reason why monetizing is the last step in creating a profitable blog is because money shouldn\u2019t be the driving factor in your early efforts. As you build meaningful relationships and community, your audience will steer you in the right direction by sharing their needs. If you want to make money blogging, then it will be your job to fulfill those needs. Conclusion Starting a blog is easy. Creating one that will be successful and make money requires hard work, dedication and grit. But, the rewards far outweigh the risks. Blogs are affordable and more accessible today than they have ever been before. Like anything else in life, there will be obstacles that attempt to throw you off course. But, I encourage you to go forward with your passion and share it through your own blog. Everything that you need to get started is here. You can begin right now by getting your free domain and web hosting at Bluehost in just minutes. As you begin your blogging journey, remember that you\u2019re speaking to humans. Be you. Be adventurous. Be honest and transparent. As you continue to consistently create great content, your tribe will flock to you, listen and respond. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Choose A Niche The first step of starting a blog is \u2013 coming up with a niche. \u201cUrrm.What is a niche?\u201d you might ask. A niche is the topic of the blog which you\u2019ll be writing about. You could choose to write about food, fashion, gaining confidence, or how about traveling guides? Pretty much anything. There are two simple methods of brainstorming for choosing your niche. Niche based on your interest/passionNiche based on the profitabilityTrying to come up with a niche can be overwhelming at times, especially when you\u2019re stuck between your interest and profitability. 2. Get A Domain Name & Hosting First of all, what is hosting and a domain name? Consider this: A hosting is an empty online house you can buy to store your blog\u2019s data for a monthly/yearly fee. This helps people to find your blog online. Without hosting, you don\u2019t have an online presence. Which means, nobody can find your blog online. A domain name is simply the name of your blog. I believe it needs no further explanation. While purchasing a domain name you need to make sure it represents your niche. Something that goes along well with what you\u2019d be writing on your blog. You can register your domain name along with your hosting provider. (I\u2019ll explain that in a bit.) Regarding hosting, there are hundreds of hosting companies out there but not every one of them is good enough. An ideal hosting provider should offer features like \u2013 Pocket-friendly pricing, 24/7customer support, great security, fast loading speed, etc. I use Bluehost to host my blog and I LOVE IT. They\u2019re the best hosting company out there for the following reasons: Keeps your blog super-fast24/7 quality support that knows how to solve thingsAffordable plansThey\u2019re officially recommended by WordPressGreat securityFree custom email accountsFree transfer from your previous hostFree SSL certificate (Very important)Super-easy to useHere\u2019s how to get your hosting with Siteground: Step 1: Head over to Bluehost Step 2: Click on \u201cReliable Web Hosting\u201d  Step 3: Choose your desired plan  I am using their Plus plan which costs $5.45/month, but if you\u2019re a new blogger, their Basic plan for $2.95/month is all you need for now. It comes with a 30-days money-back guarantee so you can cancel it anytime if you don\u2019t like their service. (But I am sure you\u2019ll love them) Step 4: Register a new domain or use your own if you already have  Step 5: Now fill all the required fields and select 12 months for the registration  Woohoo! You now have your hosting and domain. 3. Install WordPress WordPress is probably the best blogging platform out there so I recommend sticking with them. Here\u2019s how to install WordPress using the Bluehost Wizard: Step 1: Log in to your Bluehost hosting Step 2: Once you\u2019re logged in, you will see a popup asking if you want to \u201cStart a new website\u201d. Click on that and choose \u201cWordPress\u201d  Step 3: Fill out the login info such as email, username, and password. This is the information you will use to login to your WordPress dashboard. And we\u2019re done! 4. Get A Theme And Necessary Plugins Getting a premium theme is not a necessity when you\u2019re starting. Most of thefree themes come with limitations in terms of how much you can customize, butif you\u2019re on a tight budget then it\u2019s not too bad. If in case you don\u2019t want your blog to be limited in any way, then getting a premium theme is always worth the investment. I recommend taking the Divi theme.  They\u2019re highly customizable and a lot of bloggers use this. You can\u2019t go wrong with this theme. Talking about plugins, there are quite a lot of them but youdon\u2019t have to install every single one out there. A lot of plugins slow down your blog, so you only need to install those which you need. 5. Design A Logo You don\u2019t have to be a professional designer to make your logo. You can design one using this AMAZING tool called Canva. You can either choose from the wide range of logo templates or design one from scratch. It\u2019s super easy to use. If in case you don\u2019t want to design one yourself, you can hire a freelancer at Fiverr.com to design an amazing logo starting at just $5.  Most of them offer unlimited revisions until you\u2019re totally satisfied. 6. Publish Your First Blog Post This is the most exciting part of this whole process. Publishing your first blog post gets the ball rolling and it just gets easier from now on. Here\u2019s how to publish your first blog post on WordPress: Step 1: Log into your WordPress Dashboard Now you\u2019ll see a screen like this \u2013  Go ahead and fill in your username and password. Step 2: Once you\u2019re in the dashboard, you can see a lot of options on the left. Click on \u201cAdd New\u201d under the \u201cPosts\u201d tab  Step 3: Start writing your blog post Fill in the title, body, add images, add bullet points, set a featured image, select category, etc. Once you\u2019re done with all that stuff, hit \u201cPublish\u201d or click on \u201cSave Draft\u201d if you don\u2019t want to publish it right away. A good practice while writing blog posts is to check for grammatical errors. If you\u2019re like me who struggles with proofreading content, I recommend using a FREE tool such as Grammarly. It\u2019ll automatically detect spelling mistakes and grammatical errors within mere seconds. 7. Add Important Pages There are a few important pages you need to add to make sure your blog looks professional. Those are: About me: Having a good \u201cAbout me\u201d page builds trust instantly. This is the place where your readers can know that you\u2019re a real person behind the screen. Contact: Once your blog starts to get traffic, brands might want to reach out to you for potential offers. You don\u2019t want to miss out on those. Privacy, Disclaimer, and Disclosure: As a blogger, this is VERY important because it is mandatory to inform your readers: How you collect their data knowingly and unknowingly.The information which you publish is for educational purposes only.How you make money from affiliate links.Etc.Ignoring this might put you in huge trouble for not following the laws. Now, unless you\u2019re a lawyer, writing these pages yourself is not recommended. That is why I highly recommend checking out this Legal Bundle by Amira. She\u2019s a lawyer who provides very affordable legal and business solutions for people like you and me, who needs the right direction. With this bundle, you can easily set up the legal pages for your blog in a few minutes. Final Words This is the exact process you need to follow to start a blog. However, this post covers only the basics of blogging. There is a lot more to it like SEO, driving traffic, monetizing, etc. To learn all of that step-by-step, head over to our Blogging Tips category, and read our latest blogging tips. Remember: You might make a lot of mistakes in the beginning, but that\u2019s fine. The goal is to make mistakes, learn from them and moveforward. Just make sure you\u2019re having fun in the process. Time to take action ",

This works in the same way as it did with newspapers/magazines way back before the internet was a thing. They create the content - companies pay to be seen next to it. Maybe a little old fashioned but still something that is used extensively. The fact that bloggers have a lot of visitors and also a pretty good look at exactly who reads makes it attractive for companies to advertise there, since they know quite precisely how many and what target groups are reached by the advertising. They can then pay per impression, per click or per purchase. There are many different variants. Google (which also owns Youtube as you may already know) has been working for a very long time to sell advertising services where they sell and send out the ads and those who create content can have it displayed in conjunction with their content and make money that way. Blog for a magazine/platform Many great bloggers have written articles or have been featured in magazines. The exact deal the various blogs have signed may differ. Maybe the bloggers charge the magazine by how many impressions they have had in a month (which drive traffic to the magazine's website which is good for the advertisers), or they charge a flat fee per month or something similar. It is a type of win-win where the content creator does not have to get involved with the technical and sales parts so that they can instead focus entirely on creating content. it usually also means an advertising banners and sometimes the blogger has less to say about the design, which can affect the blog's usefulness and function. Affiliate links Affiliate marketing is a type of collaboration where the blogger who writes about a product uses tracking links so that they can then get commissions on what readers buy when they click on the link. It is performance-based and is a way for bloggers to be able to get paid for products they often use and like. Sponsored posts and collabs If advertising is too old-fashioned to get paid for blogging, sponsored posts and paid collaborations is the new trend! Not only in influence marketing but also in the newspaper industry (e.g. through native content and advertorials). How it works is that a blogger, in this case, starts a collaboration with a company and creates content that in one way or another favors the company that pays for it. It may be to show how a certain food is cooked or made by posting a recipe or to show how a beauty product can be used in a makeup tutorial. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Simple tutorials can be written, but if it's complex and/or takes longer than 5 minutes, create a video tutorial - Even if it's really not all that complicated of a tutorial, if there's a lot of information or it takes a while a video tutorial is much better than having to scroll forever. This isn't always true, but I'd say about 2/3rd's of the time video is the way to go. And if you are going to use videos.. 2. Take advantage of YouTube's bottomless data - I doubt it's actually bottomless but posting your videos to YouTube and embedding them in your blog will save you a ton of space on your site. It also has the added benefit of giving you another platform to generate followers on. Video is an absolute space hog so you want to avoid taking up all of your blog's GBs any way you can. 3. Post often - This is my biggest problem. I have plenty of ideas and start plenty of posts, but something always gets in the way. If you want people to follow your blog you absolutely have to post often. Even if it's just a short tip or an 'image of the day' sort of thing, the more you post the more of a chance you'll have that people will not only see, but continue to follow your blog. 4. Make your tutorials interesting - By this I mean make your tutorial some sort of project that people will look at and want to learn how to create. Even if it's just a simple explanation of the tools, people will be more likely to give your tutorial a try if they can walk away with something cool they've created. I've been using Photoshop for a long time now and I still do tutorials if it's an interesting project.  5. Join the community - Aside for posting often this is one of the best things you can do to increase traffic to your blog. If someone likes your post or follows your blog, follow them. Post comments on other people's blogs and stay engaged with the overall blogging community in any way you can. The more you give the more you get. If you post comments on people's sites and engage with their content they're far more likely to engage with yours. Guest blogging is also a great way to engage with the blogging community so ask other people whose blogs you admire to write something for your blog, or vice versa. 6. Post links to your content everywhere you can - On Wordpress when I post something it shoots out a link to my Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook. Aside for sharing your content via your social media accounts, get people to spread the word on their own by offering them a guest blogging spot or your eternal gratitude. Outside of social media you have a lot of different options when spreading the word. Comment sections are a great place but you have to be careful to make your link dropping relevant. Don't just spam sites with your links otherwise you might end up getting yourself banned or actually turning people away. As far as making money with it, I can't really answer that. My blog is just a personal project that I enjoy doing when I have the time so I've never looked into how to make money with it. All of the above are equally relevant whether it's for fun or profit though, but I imagine when it comes to making money with a blog there are a lot of extra things you need to focus on (ads, SEO solutions, etc.).

            "answer_text": "Blogging is a real way to make money. Blogging is also a gateway to many other things and should be noted that not everyone reaches success. Creating great content repeatedly takes a lot of crafting and knowledge. Just talking about the day's activities isn't going to turn you into TechCrunch, or have advertisers flooding you with offers.  I want to take a segment here to make a point. I really wish people would come and take a moment to reflect on success and how it is achieved. It's normally, with exception, through hard work and unwavering commitment to their project. There are far too many questions asking if you can get rich from blogging (and that's OK, obviously we are on a site made for this). It's akin to asking if you could get rich by playing soccer. You could if you were amazing and found by the right people and happen to be better than 99.99998% of the world's population. (those numbers are provided by guessing) Blogging and AdSense is not some turnkey success, which is what so many are chasing. Blogging happened because people wanted to create and share things. It wasn't because it was a quick way to get rich. Those that did, were able to nab the beginning and an end to an opportunity through the unique birth of the internet. It will seldom be repeated.  This isn't taking you to task for asking a valid question. I am trying to get people to understand that you certainly can achieve success and riches by doing the following: Create unbelievable content that people have to consume.Have an amazing blog that has authority in it's niche.Create visuals, audio, video.Become popular on social media platforms.Do it always.Those things will get you pointed in the right direction. You have to be truly dedicated if you want to be rich or even make money through blogging. There is no turnkey solution here as much as I would love one.  The other piece to this is having something that people want. What niche? Who are you? Is it just mass-produced content? Getting rich using AdSense? There are many variables to making money blogging. If that is your driver though to starting a blog, I would advise you not to do it. You will be driven by money and not passion, therefore people will see right through it. Being passionate is huge. I argued the other day that I wish all internet advertisements were gone and everyone should have an ad blocker installed. I was then told that most of the internet wouldn't exist. I was happy to hear that. I am a firm believer that if 95% of the internet shutdown tomorrow, we would still be just fine if not better off. People will support deserving projects. The question I would ask you, is, \"Is your's one of them?\" Adam ",

            "answer_text": "For all the hype online, blogging is damn hard work. It is a long term process that can take years of work before the first dollar is ever earned. After learning this the hard way, I began working in Niche Sites. I still blog for passion, but the niche sites are my earners - they create the passive income that allows me to work on my blog without depending on an income from it. What are Niche Sites? A Niche Site is an information based website that is designed to answer a customer\u2019s question, as asked in a Google Search. Once the customer visits your site and their question is answered, the site is set up to direct them to Amazon (or another similar program) where they ideally make a purchase, and you get a commission. For example \u2013 a customer is looking to buy a new Vacuum Cleaner. They Google the phrase \u201cbest vacuum cleaner\u201d and in the search results, they see your niche site called http://www.vacuumcleanerreviews.com. They visit your page where you discuss and compare vacuum cleaners, and after using your site for extensive research, they click on a link that takes them to Amazon, where they make a purchase. Cha-Ching! You just earned a commission, all while laying on a beach with a cocktail in hand! Some examples of niche sites can be found at http://watchesacademy.com/, http://herpackinglist.com and https://www.50em.com/ All of these sites are examples of sites that provide answers to customers and make money by referring to different programs or shopping websites where they earn a percentage of the purchase price. Why I love Niche Sites! As we started traveling, my intention was to begin building Niche Sites. It is widely recognized that an average site will generate between $USD500-$2000 or more per month. So in theory, build 10, 20 or 30 of them and you are generating an incredible income! But, as we began to travel I got completely caught up in our new adventure and forgot about my plan to get started! Fast forward a few months and as money started running out I finally got around to it. And OMG these sites are amazing! Yes, they take time to get started. Yes, they take time to grow and develop. But once established, each site is like a little pot of gold that just keeps on earning! Now there are many ways to generate an income online. Blogging is super popular, however, it is proven to be a long hard slog to build your audience and begin to generate an income. After more than 12 months of working on No Set Address, I was shocked to discover that in just the first few months, my Niche Site traffic was surpassing my blog traffic, and with a fraction of the work!!! Plus, I was actually earning money! So now I am completely addicted to building sites, watching them grow and seeing my bank account increase! Every morning I wake up and check Amazon to see what we\u2019ve earned and check Analytics to see how many visitors stopped by.  Traffic to a new niche site that we launched in Jan 2017.  And the clicks, purchases and money start rolling in from Amazon! Why You Need to Build One NOW! My biggest regret with building Niche Sites is that I didn\u2019t start earlier. Niche sites take time to be recognized by Google and they take time to grow, both of which we have little control over. In the early months, you may only earn a few dollars. however, assuming things go to plan, month after month the site will grow and your income will increase. But it\u2019s not quick. So the sooner you get started, the better! I\u2019m absolutely kicking myself now that I didn\u2019t start sooner! And, if I could offer my earlier self one piece of advice, it would be to get started ASAP! Would You Like to Learn How to Build Niche Sites? Beginning May 1st 2017 we are launching our Niche Site Bootcamp. Even if you have never built a website in your life, this course will take you step by step through the process of building a niche site. At the end of the course, you will have your very own site, and the skills to build more! For full details about the course, please visit our Bootcamp page here. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Look Here, You can earn more than $1000 by just blogging. But many bloggers fail in blogging due to many reasons. I have made more than **$10000** from blogging. Actually I have enjoyed each and every blog that I wrote. This is my last income from Google Adsense  You never need to do hard work as everyone said. You just need to build your future. There are many ways to earn money from blogging. Each and every way has its own PROS and CONS. But, I recommend you all to have a good hosting company because good hosting can only handle your traffic otherwise, You will lose your precious visitors. By Google Adsense \ud83d\udd35If you have heard about blogging then the first method that you have heard about Google Adsense. It is a more popular way to monetize your content. However, You can\u2019t trust them. PROS of Google Adsense You can trust GoogleUser Interest AdsCONS of Google Adsense They can anytime block your accountVery Low CPCNeed very high traffic for good incomeCan Not Be Your Primary Source of IncomeI personally recommend you to not go with Google Adsense because they can anytime block your Adsense account, Which means if you have earned something $100, and Your account is banned by Google for any reason then you can\u2019t withdrawal your $100 also. This is the worst policy of Google Adsense in India 2. By Affiliate Marketing \ud83d\udd35 Well, Affiliate marketing is a very good source of income. For those who don\u2019t know about Affiliate Marketing, Let me explain it with an example - Suppose, You want to Promote Apple Products\u2026 You will visit Apple\u2019s websiteSign Up for their Affiliate MarketingYou can promote Apple\u2019s Product on your websiteWhenever Someone will buy Apple\u2019s product through your websiteYou will get a commission from itPROS of Affiliate Marketing Very High incomeTarget TrafficNeed Low TrafficCONS of Affiliate Marketing You have to learn SEONeed Time (Patience)and, Currently, I don\u2019t see any disadvantage of Affiliate Marketing. But, The most important thing is your Niche and keyword researching technique. If you are targeting a wrong keyword then there is no advantage of this. So, Make sure you choose a better NICHE. Many of the new affiliate marketers creating their blog on AMAZON Products. Because there is very less and less competition in Amazon Niche. So, That you can switch to Amazon, If you are just starting out. In Amazon Niche, You can target keywords like \u201cBest laptop under 30K, Best mixer grinder for kitchen, etc\u201d  I searched that particular keyword on Google to know the best laptop under 30K. I will click on vsbytes(dot)com and if I liked any laptop from their list then to know more I will switch to Amazon by clicking one of their affiliate link present. and, Suppose I bought one laptop and two mobile phones within 24 hours of that affiliate click. The best thing is now happening, You will get a commission of laptop as well as mobile phone that was bought by the person who was searching for \u201cBest laptop under 30K\u201d If there is something left or have some greater suggestions then please let me know by commenting below.

            "answer_text": "Hi Folks, Here is how to make money from a blog: Set up your blogStart creating useful contentGet off your blog and start finding readersBuild engagement with the readers that comeStart making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streamsSounds easy doesn\u2019t it! On some levels the process is simple \u2013 but you need to know up front that there\u2019s a lot to each step and below I\u2019m going to give you some pointers on each including some further reading. Here\u2019s how to make money from a blog. 1. Start a Blog In order to make money blogging you\u2019re going to need to have a blog. While this is pretty obvious it is also a stumbling block for many PreBloggers who come to the idea of blogging with little or no technical background. If that\u2019s you \u2013 don\u2019t worry! It was my story too and most bloggers start out feeling a little overwhelmed by the process of starting their blog. If you need a little help I would highly recommend you check out my article How to Start a Blog in which I run through the steps you need to take to get up and running. It\u2019s really not as hard as you might think! 2. Start Creating Useful Content A blog is not a blog without content so once you\u2019ve set your blog up you need to focus your attention upon creating useful content. What you choose to create will depend a little on the topic that you choose to write about (on that note, most successful bloggers have some focus to their blogging whether that be a niche or a demographic that they write for). The key with creating content is to make it as useful as possible. Focus upon creating content that changes people\u2019s lives in some way will be the type of content that people will value the most and it will help people to feel like they know, like and trust you \u2013 which is really important if you later want to make money from your blog.  3. Get off your blog and start finding readers As you create the most useful content that you possibly can it is easy to get very insular with your focus and spend most of your time looking at building your blog. Many bloggers have a \u2018build it and they will come mentality\u2019 with their blogging but this is a bit of a trap. If you want to make money from your blog you need to not only focus upon building a great blog but it is also necessary to get off your blog and to start promoting it. There are many ways to experiment with growing your blog\u2019s audience that I\u2019ve written in previous blog posts and talked about in podcasts (I\u2019ll share some further reading and listening below) but it is important to enter into all these strategies remembering that you should not just be looking for \u2018traffic\u2019 but \u2018readers\u2019. Start by thinking carefully about the type of reader you\u2019d like to have read your blog. You might like to create an avatar of that reader (sometimes called a reader persona or profile) to help you work out who you\u2019re trying to attract. Once you know who you\u2019re hoping to have read your blog ask yourself where that type of person might already be gathering online. Begin to list where they might be gathering: 4. Build engagement with the readers that come With sustained focus upon creating great content and finding readers for your blog you\u2019ll begin to notice people visiting your blog and engaging with your content. At this point you need to switch your focus to engaging with those readers and building community. Respond to comments, reach out to those readers personally and do everything that you can to keep them coming back again and again by building a \u2018sticky blog\u2019. Look after the readers you already have well and you\u2019ll find they spread the word of your blog for you and help make your blog even more widely read. Having an engaged reader is also much easier to make money from. 5. Start making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streams OK \u2013 the first four steps of starting a blog, creating content, finding readers and building engagement with those readers are important foundations that you really do need to get in place before you\u2019ll be able to build long term income for your blog. There\u2019s no avoiding that what we\u2019ve covered is a lot of work but if you do it well you\u2019ll be setting yourself up well and giving yourself every chance of being able to make money from your blog. With these foundations in place you\u2019re now ready to start attempting to make money from your blog but you do need to be aware that just because you have set up your blog, have content and have engaged readers that the money won\u2019t just automatically flow. It takes continued work and experimentation to make money from your blog.

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to achieve passive income. For example, buying into dividend stock. What if the dividend pay-outs aren\u2019t enough for you? Most of us don\u2019t have a large enough sum of initial capital to generate large amounts of dividends. So how else can you create passive income? Through blogging, that\u2019s how! Selling advertising space This is the most common method of monetising blogs, and is also the most passive. Using platforms such as Google Adsense, you can place banner ads on your site and be paid on a \u2018per view\u2019 or \u2018per click\u2019 basis. Of course, this won\u2019t work too well if your blog is fairly new or hasn\u2019t got much readership. To generate substantial income off ads, you first need to ensure that you publish content that ranks high on Google search or other search engines. It also helps if you only publish quality content, which ensures that you attract a continuous stream of traffic. Let us stop you here if you\u2019re somehow convinced that you can become a millionaire off selling ad space \u2013 you probably can\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve got a million visitors every single day. Selling ad space admittedly doesn\u2019t rake in boatloads of money, but it is still a legitimate way of earning some passive income through blogging. Selling your own products By this, we don\u2019t mean creating your own line of cosmetics or furniture to sell online. We\u2019re talking e-products like e-books or online courses. If you\u2019ve got a specific field you have a wealth of knowledge in, why not write an e-Book about it and sell it on your blog? Or if you\u2019re better at verbalising your thoughts, you could create an online course in video form, and put that up for sale. All you have to do is spend a couple days or maybe a week on it, and your e-book/online course will be on the internet for decades to come, generating more profit for you each time someone purchases it. It\u2019s definitely a worthy investment of your time and effort. If you want more examples of how to monetize your blog, check out https://allaboutsurvival.com/2018/11/01/passive-income-blogging/ ",

            "answer_text": " Task #1: Select A Good Domain Name For Your Blog If you\u2019re unable to find a good domain name for your blog then follow these simple and easy steps to find an amazing domain name. Choose something similar \u2013 When you\u2019re choosing a domain name keep in mind that your niche name should be in your domain name because it helps people to know about your website.For example, my website is about blogging tips so I have added the word blogging in my domain name. Do not use hyphens and numbers \u2013 I have seen many bloggers they are using hyphens(-) and numbers in their domain name but I think it\u2019s not good.Let\u2019s see, an example: Good domain \u2013 exactblogging.com, Bad domain \u2013 exact-blogging.com Always choose .COM domain \u2013 If you\u2019re going to start a blog then I\u2019ll suggest you to buy a .COM domain because you can easily rank it worldwide but if you\u2019re making your site for a particular country then you can go with another domain.I hope these tips will definitely help you for choosing a good domain name. Task #2: Best Web Hosting For You On A Reasonable Price Choosing the best hosting at a reasonable price is a very difficult but very important part. The selection of bad hosting is the first biggest mistake I have ever made in my staring career. When I started my blogging career I purchased hosting at $1/month and this is my biggest mistake. Because the speed of their hosting and the customer is very bad. Due to which I had to face a lot of problems and I think I was giving my 1-2 hours in a day to solve technical issues if my blog. But the mistake I made at that time, I do not want you to repeat those mistakes again. So I\u2019ll also recommend you not to buy cheaper hosting because they will not give you good support, their speed will be very slow and there are also many problems with cheap hosting.  There are 5 most important things which you should keep in mind when buying a hosting. Page Speed \u2013 Speed matters a lot for your website So always choose a hosting that has good speed.Uptime \u2013 Uptime means how long your website is online or running. The uptime of Siteground is 99.99% and it\u2019s amazing.Customer Support \u2013 Customer support matters a lot If you buy cheap hosting in order to save some money. You will not get good customer support the are, due to which you may face many difficulties.Security \u2013 Security is also a very biggest factor Because in today\u2019s time, cybercrime has increased so much, so you need to be as alert as possible.Now you\u2019re thinking about which hosting will be good for you then I\u2019ll recommend you to go with Siteground because it has all the features that you want. How To Buy Siteground Hosting Step 1:- Visit This Special Link to activate 75% Off and choose your hosting plan. There are three plans of Siteground which you can see below:  Here you\u2019ll have to choose your plan and click on the GET PLAN button I\u2019ll recommend you to go with GrowBig plan because it has a lot of features at a reasonable price. Step 2:- Enter Your Domain Name If you already have a domain name then select the second option (I already have a domain name) and then enter your domain name.  Step 3:- Fill your personal details.  Here you will have to fill your personal details like First name, Last name, Address, Email, Password, etc. Step 4:- Enter Your Credit/Debit Card Information  Step 5:- Choose Purchase Information  Here you\u2019ll have to select the duration of your hosting (I\u2019ll recommend you to go with the 1-year plan), select your data center (United States), you can also change your plan from here. (GrowBig Recommended) Step 5:- Agree To The Terms And Conditions Wait a few seconds and you are all done. Now after some time you will get all the credentials of your hosting like your nameservers, your cPanel login details, etc. How To Connect Domain With Hosting If you have purchased your domain from another domain provider then you will have to connect your domain with your hosting. SiteGround Nameservers ns1.us203.siteground.usns2.us203.siteground.us After purchasing the hosting you\u2019ll get an email from Siteground where you will get your nameservers just go to your domain provider and enter your nameserver in your DNS settings. Task #3 - How To Install Wordpress After connecting the domain and the hosting now it\u2019s time to install WordPress on it. Step 1:- Login to your cPanel with your username and password which the hosting company provided you in the email.  Step 2:- Go to Softaculous app installer here you will see many software you have to click on the WordPress icon.  Step 3:- After clicking on the WordPress icon you will see an interface something like this now you have to click on install WordPress.  Step 4: Here you\u2019ll have to choose a site title, username and a password and an email after entering these things click on Install WordPress button.  Now you have successfully installed WordPress. If you want to open your dashboard just go to this URL (https://yourwebsite.com/wp- admin) and enter your login details. That\u2019s it! Task #3 - Design Your Blog Like A Pro Now after installing WordPress, it\u2019s time to design your website like a pro. As all the bloggers say that Content is King but according to me Content is Nothing without design. Theme matters a lot in your designing and also to speed up your website speed. Many people ask me which theme are you using on your website Exact Blogging. So do you also want to know let\u2019s know!

In 1000 visitors you can earn $10 - $15 if you\u2019ll use Adsense but if you\u2019ll do affiliate marketing then in 1000 visitors you can earn over $500. Is this sounds interesting? Today I\u2019m going to share you some affiliate tips which no one will give you but before knowing this first of all we\u2019ll learn some basics of affiliate marketing. So let\u2019s know about it! What is Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is the process of earning income every time you promote someone else products or services. If you generate a sale for the company, you get paid. If you don't generate a sale, you do not get paid. First of all, promise me that you\u2019ll implement all the strategies which I\u2019m going to share you, today. Why Affiliate Marketing Instead Of Adsense This question will definitely in your mind why we should use Affiliate Marketing instead of using Adsense. So, I have answered this question already but let me know you again : In 1000 visitors you will earn $10 - $15 (Only High CPC Keywords) if you\u2019ll use Adsense but if you\u2019ll do affiliate marketing then in 1000 visitors you can earn over $500 is this sounds interesting. So I hope now you have understood that why we should always use affiliate marketing. Happy Blogging! Cheers, Prathmesh Ydav ",

            "answer_text": "The below content is from my blog post, How to Make Money Blogging: The Real Side Hustle Truth Challenges with Blogging As a Side Hustle You\u2019ve probably read some blogging income reports that show $10,000+/month income and you think, \u201cWow, sign me up!\u201d It\u2019s easy to get hypnotized by the potential and dollar signs. Yet what you don\u2019t see, is the amount of effort it took these bloggers to get to that level. I\u2019m talking years of writing, marketing, and consistency to their blogs which has paid off. (Of course timing and a bit of luck may factor in too). There are always those unicorn bloggers that started crushing it in year one too. But that is nowhere near the norm and their hustle is on another level. And the fact is, most new bloggers only make it a few months before growing tired and quitting. When I started Invested Wallet in June 2018, by the Fall I already noticed many others who started around the same time as me had slowed down or quit completely. The reality is, there is no guarantee you\u2019ll make a lot of money even if you do everything right. You can make money, but it may take a year or maybe even longer. Many people have the impression they can get their blog up, create some content, slap some ads and affiliate links, and they are retiring on some island three months later. Or working from their camper at the beach. If only! Blogging is also tough and standing out can be a major challenge. According to some data from 2018 recorded by internetstats.com, there were more than 1,883,637,867 websites online. That doesn\u2019t even account for all the ones that post content then monthly, weekly, or daily! The competition is fierce! The other challenge is blogging is time-consuming. Think about all the pieces to this like establishing hosting, building your website, writing quality content every week, promoting content, and other marketing aspects (social media, email, etc.)  How to Make Money Blogging As I mentioned above, this is not to completely discourage you from blogging. It\u2019s important to confront the realities that just because you start a blog, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll make an insane amount of money. However, even with the amount of competition, the online world continues to grow and there is still room for you. While content might be shifting, it\u2019s also not dying off quite yet or really anytime soon. And you can make money blogging in various ways. Many of these eventually bring in some decent recurring revenue and you even have a chance to bring more than a full-time salaried job. Exciting! But pump the brakes if you are getting too hyped again and re-read my above sections to bring you back to the realities. Blogging is HARD WORK. But here\u2019s how to make money blogging. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is simply promoting products that you link on your blog or within blog posts that when someone clicks and signs up, you get a commission. I like and dislike affiliate marketing and also cringe when I see blogs \u2013for lack of a better term \u2014 whore out their content to stuff affiliates all over. However, if you do it correctly, have a strategy, and promote products you actually believe in and fits with your audience, it can work out well for you. I currently only have a few and don\u2019t really promote them heavily. There are a few websites and blogs who are affiliate-based only and are crushing it. Even some sites recently have been bought out for millions because of how much affiliate revenue the blogs were bringing in. Pros: It can be easy income for doing little and as your site grows and ranks, that traffic all has potential to convert. Pending your industry, some affiliates have great payouts ($50+). Cons: Affiliates can shut down or change their pay structure whenever, dumping affiliates all over appears tacky and spammy, making money takes time and there is no consistency. Many affiliates pay very little too. Advertising Probably the most standard form of making money from blogging, is running ads. I currently run some basic ads on my site, although I was a bit reluctant at first. Typically, I think they sometimes disrupt the user experience if not targeted well and can slow a website down. I joined a specific network, which offers more tailored ads and better payments for running ads.This is something I\u2019d recommend over joining Adsense, which has terrible ad experiences and extremely low payouts. You can also sell ad space individually to brands, which can work too but may be more time-consuming. Pros: Little work involved, potential recurring revenue. Cons: Can disrupt user experience, income relies on your traffic growing. Sponsored Posts The idea behind this is working with a brand on content that promotes them or educates your audiences about their product or services. Sometimes the brand may write it or you may also write it, either way you charge them for this. I actually like this option and it\u2019s a great way to make money blogging. Typically, if you have a good audience and can provide value, you can charge a few hundred all the way to a few thousand to do so. However, you need to follow FTC guidelines and also ensure you follow Google\u2019s rules so your website doesn\u2019t get penalized and deranked. This has been my main source of income on the blog so far, but I haven\u2019t put much focus on on it either yet. These can also branch out into brand partnerships, which are longer commitments but can generate great income. Pros: Potential to make great money, not always as much work pending how you approach sponsored content. Cons: No consistent revenue when you are starting, a lot of spammers ask to do this for cheap.Doing this too much can turn audiences aways. Courses This has also been a popular trend among blogs and bloggers, is creating a paid course. These are a lot of work to set up, plus you need to ensure you actually are providing real value first. A lot of information can be found online for free and are things you can teach yourself. However, if you can provide value and you have an engaged audience, courses can bring in some good recurring revenue once they are published. Pros: Can bring in huge sums of money and can be on a recurring passive basis once courses are created. Cons: Tons of up front work, you need an engaged audience willing to pay, you need to prove you are an expert and have something worth to say. Selling Digital Products A great way to make recurring passive income is with digital products. Things you create that you have for purchase on your website. Think of items like ebooks, toolkits, documents, plugins, photography, etc. Here is some more about digital products. Pros: Low overhead costs, potential automated income, higher profit margins for you. Cons: You need to create something worth paying for, can take time to create, need an audience engaged enough to purchase from you. Contract Work If you focus on a particular blog niche, you may start offering your services and knowledge to other companies. For example, I can offer marketing and digital marketing services since that is my background, but doesn\u2019t always translate well since most of this site is all about finances. But a lot of bloggers actually make their first bit of money this way. Pros: Great earning potentials, can work on your time and availability, no commutes. Cons: No consistency guaranteed in revenue, can take time to find clients. Freelance Writing Another cool option for making money from your blog, is freelance writing opportunities that are paid. This may depend on your niche and many times it may not be paid, but this does happen. Your blog is a great content training tool and shows off your writing chops. You might be able to apply for freelance writing gigs or brands may reach out to you. Pros: another revenue source, expands your brand and personal brand reach. Cons: Not always easy to get paid writing gigs, not a consistence source of revenue to rely on. Selling Your Blog You\u2019ve heard the cool stories of former bloggers selling their websites for six-figures and then some! Again, this takes a lot of time and many factors in order for this to work in your favor, but it can be done. Marc over at Vital Dollar has done it a few times! But you can also buy, build up, and flip blogs for money too. Netting a few thousand dollars each time. Pros: You can get a nice lump sum or if you buy and flip can make decent money from that as well. Cons: Extremely time-consuming, you have to know how to build up websites so they are worth something in the future, even great websites have no guarantee that anyone would want to buy it. Finding a buyer takes time or you\u2019ll need a broker to help.  Can You Make Good Money with Your Blog? Absolutely you can, but you need to be realistic. Good money and blogging income reports you have read do not come easy and it takes a lot of work. But, the cool thing about blogging is there are multiple streams and ways to monetize your work and efforts. This besides additional opportunities you might get as well from being a thought leader in your blogging niche. Some bloggers also get paid speaking gigs and others have gotten book deals! It\u2019s pretty cool where blogging can potential take you. But even if you don\u2019t make money or turn blogging into a full-time career, you will learn a lot. For me, it taught me so much more about marketing and is also a great resume booster. When I had a music blog, many job interviews I went on at the time loved that I created something and grew it on my own. I think if you go in with the realities that blogging won\u2019t make you rich overnight or even in a year +, then you have a good shot of succeeding and making some money. And just because the odds might be slightly stacked against you, doesn\u2019t mean you should not give a shot. My best advice if you do get into blogging to make money, is ignore the noise and income reports.Stay focused on your blog and be patient. If you\u2019d like to learn how to set up a WordPress blog in a few steps and grow it, I wrote this post which might be valuable to you. ",

In fact, by following the point-by-point instructions in this guide, you will learn how to create a blog in no time (no technical skills required). Before you get into the motion sequences, let us summarize some valuable information. This section provides background information (running a blog 101) that will help you understand why other people start a blog and probably the most common questions a blog newbie will ask in general. What is a blog? Some people still don\u2019t know what a blog is? A blog (abbreviated from the word \u201cblog\u201d) is called so many things \u2013 a digital magazine, diary, news bulletin, collector\u2019s item, an exhibition of your artwork, data exchange, educational center, a place where you can gather information, and\u2026. smart, practically everything else you need. A standard blog combines text, images, movies and hyperlinks to relevant pages and media on the web. Blog readers can leave out feedback and stay in touch with the author. In fact, dialogue and interaction are a popular part of the success of a blog. How can you start a blog at no cost? People often wonder where to start a blog, but there are a number of blog platforms that allow you to start a blog for free. All you have to do is select the option you want, set up an account and start blogging. For example, in a matter of a few minutes you will set up a detached blog on Blogger or Tumblr. But you want to understand a few things when you start a free blog: When you open a Blogspot account, your loose blog title can be in this form: \u201cBird's eye view\u201d or \u201cTumblr\u201d. In the blogging community, this type of blog is the sign of a green beginner who is unlikely to be viewed critically. They are subject to the laws and restrictions established by the platform. They can prohibit or forbid you to use ads, or they will even place their own ads in your blog. If you are eager to run a blog, you should remove this feature faster than later. To start a blog the exact way you want, we strongly recommend setting up a self-hosted blog with WordPress, and we can find instructions on how to run a blog information.

            "answer_text": "Make your blog posts awesome and engaging. Even if there are only a few posts on there, make them great \u2014 concise and focused on your niche. Think of your blog as a rolling audition for paying gigs. In my experience, paying blog clients want to see three things: that you know how to get comments, stick to a niche topic, and use common blogging platforms such as WordPress and Blogger. Select your targets. Consider where you might likely blog for pay, based on your own interests and work experience. For instance, I was once a legal secretary, so I\u2019ve done some paid blogs for lawyers. Develop a list of publications, companies, or Web portals that might hire you and pay well. Don\u2019t ignore trade publications, as they are often good payers. Once you\u2019ve got some possible prospects, take a look at their websites to see if they lack a blog, or perhaps have a blog that\u2019s short on visitors and infrequently updated. Research your targets. Next, do some sleuthing to discover who might pay well. In general, I find more sophisticated topics and target audiences command better pay and have less writer competition. So blogging about parenting or your dog will not pay well, but writing about acupuncture or business finance likely will. Next, find out if the publication is growing or the company is well-funded. Writers\u2019 groups on LinkedIn are a great place to ask around about a prospective employer. In general, bigger companies will offer better pay. Promote your blog posts in social media. Start spreading your content around. Connect with popular users of social media in the niche where you want to blog for pay. Target prospects with your posts. When you have a post that makes a good audition piece, send it to your prospects (or top social-media influencers) with a note: \u201cI thought you\u2019d enjoy this post.\u201d You can use Twitter, LinkedIn, or just plain email \u2014 whatever you think that prospect would respond to best. Even better: Write a post for your blog specifically tailored to appeal to your prospects, then send it to them. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Janet, Before answering your question I want to thank you for choosing me to answer this question. I will share with you my top 5 top tips to earn money blogging. If you are looking to earn money with your blog, especially more of a full-time income, it helps to have a lot of different resources from which to choose to help give you a lot of options. And as far as income, sometime we hear you can\u2019t earn full-time income as a blogger, while at other times we hear all about the heroes slaying the dragons in the Blogger-land and you\u2019re convinced these stories must have happened on another planet or that these heroes are just demi-gods. But I\u2019m here to tell you it really is possible to earn lots of cool cash from your blog! Be warned though, it can take a long time to start earning cash from blogging so don\u2019t start expecting overnight miracles. If you are in need of money quickly then you go to one of the MDP pawn shops in San Diego.  So let\u2019s dive into some of the many options out there to help you get started! AD NETWORKS Ad networks are the link between bloggers and brands or companies seeking to advertise their products and services. They find unsold advertising space from publishers. Then, they fill that space with digital ad campaigns and sponsorships from their clients. This can be done using several different types of formats, such as text, image and/or video. Most sponsored ads you see online, whether a sponsored post or a sidebar ad, were created by these ad networks. Ad networks tend to look for successful bloggers with steady traffic to place these ads on their website. However, even if you\u2019re just starting or don\u2019t have a huge following yet, you can still work with ad networks. This can be especially true if you are in a more specialized or smaller niche with less competition. Related: 11 Proven Ways To Monetize Your Blog (and actually make money) There are various levels of difficulty in landing business with an ad network and earning money blogging. Some networks can be fairly easy to obtain approval from, such as Propeller Ads and Pollinate Media. While others will take a bit more work, and some will seem nearly impossible to get connected with. I\u2019ve heard that Blogher is a tough nut to crack, and know of some ladies on their waiting list more than a year and still waiting. Persistence and patience can be key in earning money blogging. Quality is important as well, so be sure your blog looks professional. Once you get in with a couple of networks, it is easier to get additional business from them. In addition, it can also be easier to connect with some of the tougher networks once you have done business with others.  One great thing is that not all of them have a minimum followers requirement, such as Revenue Hits. So again, even if you\u2019re a new to blogging or have a smaller audience, you still have some great options. It may take a little more work, but it can be worth it. And money-wise, it\u2019s possible to make from $10 to $200 per day with ad networks. Check out the list below for some of the more popular and successful ad networks for earning money blogging. Be sure you research which are the best fit for your needs and niche before you start reaching out to them. 1. Ad Cash2. Adsterra Network3. Adversal4. Verizon Media Homepage5. Amazon Associate6.

And WordPress is the best platform for starting a blog. Here\u2019s a great solution for starting your blog for $20.93 only - How to Start Your Own Blog (Self-hosted WordPress) How to make money from a blog? Let's show my ways of making such amount of money. The short-cut steps to making money with a blog are the following - (1) Content -> (2) Traffic -> (3) Conversion -> (4) $$$ You can see how easy it's to make money with a blog, right? NO. Every step of the process has much pain that many of the bloggers can't bear. But you should be glad to know that if you craft the skills on how to make money blogging, then nothing could stop you from making money from your blog. So, here are the steps again in a much broader way - (1) Create persuasive content on your blog Content is king and the first thing that you'll have to do after starting your blog is to create irresistible content for your blog. This content will engage your readers when they'll come to your blog. (2) Bring traffic (visitors) to your blog For the first time, your content even if it's the best in the blogosphere, can't bring any reader to your blog. So, you should utilize some things to tell people that your blog has plenty of good content to read. These are the different traffic generation techniques that you should learn and follow in order to welcome tons of traffic to your blog. (3) Show them some products that'll create value to them The internet is full of different affiliate products that you can promote on your blog. You can also make your own products and sell them to your readers by promising them that these will create value to their online business or whatever field they're seeking for. There are many other ways through which a blog can be monetized, but the mentioned two methods are the best ones and I recommend you to follow any of the two or both the methods for monetizing your blog. (4) Start making money from your blog Once you can nurture the 1st, 2nd, and the 3rd steps well for a decent period of time (it varies from blogger to blogger), you can see that making money from a blog isn't a daydream anymore.

            "answer_text": "It is a long and patient process to earn money through blogs. You need to be patient and keep on updating your blog for at least 3 months before thinking of earning money from it. Register with Bidvertiser, infolinks and shareaholic initially. And after you create a steady flow of readers/users to your blog, you can make consistent money with your blog. Also, I would suggest you to give links of your posts in Quora under various questions to generate initial traffic. Simultaneously, create a new page in Facebook and advertise it as much as possible and get as many followers as possible. Thereafter, give links to your blog on your facebook page. If it is interesting enough then you will get traffic and hence generate revenue from your blog. Tweet about your posts using twitter. Say you write something on terrorism then identify relevant hashtags and tweet your post's link. I would suggest you to personally tag people who are actively tweeting about that topic. This way you will get more followers and over a period of time, you will generate a lot of traffic using twitter. Make an account in scoop it and submit links to it. These are the best ways to generate initial traffic. For search engines to list you, it will take a considerable amount of time. Lastly, you would find many blogs which would suggest you to submit your posts links to Reddit, stumbleupon, pinterest and tumblr. Though they are good but they generally don't generate a lot of traffic initially.  Finally, keep on updating your blog because content is the king. Good content will attract more visitors over a period of time.  Initially, it would be like 20 percent of your time will be spent on creating content and the rest 80 percent of your time will be spent in publicizing your blog on various platforms. This can be laborious and frustrating but you need to be patient in this phase. Finally, after sustaining the initial few months, once you have a good FB page, lot of followers on twitter and enough points on quora then you will find the going easy :) Once the initial phase is through, I will suggest you to apply for adsense and replace all existing ads on your site with Adsense ads. Make no mistake, adsense is the best way to generate revenue.  A word of caution though, don't invest money in advertising before you have enough content on your site. It will be a waste of money and time and is quite discouraging also. I wish you luck and let me know your thoughts in the comments section. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a very hot topic. Now if you haven\u2019t started a blog and still searching for an answer of this question, then my friend its going to be very difficult for you to make money out of it. The best tip anyone could provide is - Focus on the brand value of your blog, not on the money you can generate out of it. To do so, your blog have to generate a good amount of traffic. Without readers, you\u2019ll get nothing. So focus on the content and the brand value of your blog. Write for readers not for money. Now going straight to your answer- How to earn money out of a blog? There can be various sources to generate money from your blog. That includes affiliate marketing, direct ads, Promotional/sponsored posts, Ads through 3rd party like Google Adsense etc. Google Adsense is the first choice of any newbie blogger, you must have already heard about Adsense. Design your blog, add some good content and try to get some traffic. Always write healthy and unique content. Don\u2019t copy from anyone. Apply for adsense and wait for the approval. After the approval, you can place ads on your blog. The more viewers you get, the more Adsense earnings you\u2019ll get. But to make a good amount of money through adsense, there are two conditions: Either get some quality traffic from countries like US, Australia, UK, etc (Tier 1 &2 Countries)2. Or you need a huge amount of traffic from countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Adsense works mainly on CPC & CPM. CPC is the biggest factor to earn from adsense. Clicks on ads from the traffic of Tier 1 countries have the highest CPC (cost per click) followed by Tier2, then Tier3 & so on. My highest CPC till date is $9, awesome right? P.S Don\u2019t get trap by the myth of high CPC keywords. To be very frank this is useless & time waisting. Just select keywords that has high search rate. Now coming to the Direct ads. No blogger would be happy by earning alon with Adsense, though I am not talking about exceptions. To make a good amount of money, Adsense is not good. Yes, Adsense don\u2019t care about the actual worth of your traffic. If you are getting a good amount of views on your blog then you will be approached by many companies that would want you to place their ads on your website and will pay a very good amount of money. Affiliate Marketing is the king. The best source of income through a blog. Promote products by doing reviews, sharing offers, coupons. etc and use your affiliate/referral link inside the posts and you\u2019ll get affiliate income. If anyone purchases anything from your affiliate link, you\u2019ll get your commission. My highest income through a click - with Adsense -$9 with Affiliate Marketing - more than a $100 So I hope you got some idea on how to make money out of a blog. But I am telling you again, don\u2019t run for money from the start. Focus on your content and on your audience. Try to get more audience rather that making more money. Peace! ",

            "answer_text": "1. Building Your Readership There are lots of ways to monetize your blog once you have a good number of visitors. But when you are just starting out you won\u2019t have many readers, so it\u2019s important to make the most of each one. That means that you need to make sure first-time readers of your blog will come back. Only by having returning readers will you ever build a sizable audience that you can profit from. So how can you stay in touch with your readers? The easiest and best way is to ask them for an email address where you can contact them with updates. By collecting your readers\u2019 email addresses from the very beginning of your blog you will build the biggest mailing list possible. Ever wonder why just about every website you go to asks for you to sign up with your email address? In marketing, there is a saying that \u201cthe money is in the mailing list\u201d. This is because a mailing list allows you to contact people over and over again. Every time you send an email to your list you can offer them products/services or just get them to your visit your blog again where you can make money from ads (discussed below). This is exactly what big companies like Groupon do with their mailing lists. They send out offers on a daily or weekly basis You will need an email marketing service to get started. By far the easiest and most reliable that I have found is Constant Contact, which offers a free trial of their services for new bloggers. I have put together a complete step-by-step tutorial on how to use Constant Contact with your blog. 2. Monetizing Your Blog Once you have built a decent readership base you can turn your attention to making money from your blog. There a variety of way to do this, but one of the most lucrative ways also happens to be the easiest- advertising. Having a large number of visitors to your blog means that advertisers will pay to have their ads shown to your readers. The easiest way to blog for money is to get paid for showing advertisements on your blog by joining Google\u2019s AdSense program at Google AdSense - Earn Money From Website Monetization Once you setup your account on AdSense you will be given a code to add to your blog. This code will automatically display advertisements on your blog from companies who are part of Google\u2019s advertising network. You may see ads from small companies related to your topic, or you may see ads from large companies that are completely unrelated to your topic. The nice thing about AdSense is that you have thousands of advertisers bidding to advertise on your blog, and all you have to do is add the simple code to your blog. Once you do that the process is completely hands off. How much can you make? The amount that you can make from AdSense depends on three factors: 1. The number of visitors to your blog This one is pretty obvious. More people visiting your blog means more clicks on advertisements, which means more money for you. 2. The visibility of the ads When you put the AdSense code on your blog you have a choice of the style of advertisements (large images, small images, text, etc.) and also where they are placed. The more prominently the ads are displayed the more likely they are to be clicked. However, you have to balance placing the ads prominently with the prospect of possibly annoying your readers. We have all visited blogs where it\u2019s difficult to see the content due to the number and size of the ads. This is a delicate balance to achieve and it\u2019s something you will have to experiment with to get the most out of your blog. 3. The topic you are blogging about The final factor that affects your AdSense income is the topic you are blogging about. This is because advertisers will pay more to be on certain blogs than they will for others. For example, if your site is about golf, your readers are likely to have a healthy income. Because of this, there are a good number of advertisers that want to get their ads in front of your readers, and they are likely to pay a good amount per click to do this. Contrast this with a blog about Justin Bieber. The readers of this blog are likely to be teenage girls, who usually don\u2019t have very much purchasing power. Because of this advertisers will likely pay less for each click. Let's know something more about making money online. ",

            "answer_text": "You have two main options when it comes to actually setting up a blog \u2013 you can use a free blogging platform, or you can create your own website. We'll take you through both, and outline their pros and cons, so you can make the right decision for you and your blog. Free blogging platformsCredit: Universal PicturesBest for: Casual bloggers and those not interested in making money from their blog.Pros: Super easy to set up and completely free.Cons: Limits on customisation and video/image uploads, you often can't place adverts or use affiliate links, you can't create a custom URL and the platform retains the right to delete your blog.A lot of platforms will allow you to set up a blog for free, and they're super easy to use. If you're just wanting to blog casually at first, this could suit you well.But, free blogging platforms can be very limiting. You'll only be able to customise to a limited extent, and your blog will have a storage limit which could make it harder to upload large videos and images.Another drawback is that your blog URL will be something like 'All about you' with the platform branding.Most free blogging platforms also don't allow you to place banner adverts or affiliate links on your site, which are key revenue streams for most bloggers.However, if these things don't bother you, here's a quick rundown of the best free online blogging platforms.Best blogging sitesWordPress.com \u2013 This is a free basic blog hosting service that's easy to use. You'll have to put up with WordPress ads and branding unless you pay a monthly fee, and you can't put ads on your site. There are also limited options for customisation and expansion.Blogger \u2013 Google's free blog hosting service, Blogger, is really simple to use. But, the customisation and design options are very limited, and there aren't a lot of options if you want to add new features.Medium \u2013 With Medium, the emphasis is on the writing rather than design, and it's used by lots of journalists, writers and experts. It's a great way to share your work with a particular community, but you can't run any ads and it's difficult to create your own personal branding.Create your own websiteCredit: Kalamurzing - ShutterstockBest for: Dedicated bloggers and those looking to make money from their blogPros: Complete control over design and customisation, your own custom URL and the ability to use adverts and affiliate links how you likeCons: You'll have to pay \u2013 firstly for your domain name (URL) and then for hosting, but we've got tips on keeping costs low.If you're not particularly tech-savvy, the thought of creating your own website might seem quite scary \u2013 but it's actually pretty easy to do, and you can create one in just 20 minutes.Save the Student's founder, Owen, has written an easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to show you how to start a website.With your own website, you'll be able to create unique personal branding (with your own URL), and there's no risk of your blog being deleted by the platform \u2013 you'll own the site and be in complete control.WordPress has an insane amount of templates or 'themes' for you to choose from \u2013 take your time to decide on one which suits both your personality and the topic of your blog.Opt for something clear and simple, with space for large images and easy-to-read fonts (Comic Sans and Courier fonts are no-nos).Create your own website \u00bbHow to choose a blog topic  Credit: ABC This can either be the easiest or the hardest part of starting your blog. The most important thing at this stage is to choose a niche which you can call yourself an authority in \u2013 the biggest mistake new bloggers make in such a crowded blogosphere is starting a blog without trying to do something surprising or different. For example, if fashion's your thing, instead of combining generic fashion content, you could combine your love for clothes with your big-hearted concern for the environment by blogging about environmentally-conscious designers instead? These are the best ways to find a topic for your new blog: Look at other blogs \u2013 This should be your first port of call. What's already successful? And more importantly, what's missing? Find the gaps in the market.Use Google \u2013 What are people searching for? Use Google suggested searches and auto-complete to discover what people are looking for \u2013 if they're searching for it, that shows there's a demand.Search forums for common FAQs \u2013 When people can't find answers to their questions, they go to forums. What are they asking? What do they need advice on? This will show what people are interested in and what there's a lack of available information on.Track current trends \u2013 What topics are in the media right now? It's good to pick a topic with longevity, but if you can piggy-back on a trend early on, you can quickly establish yourself as an expert on it before anyone else. Searching #journorequest on Twitter shows what kind of themes journalists are currently reporting on.Think about different types of content \u2013 Could you do tutorials/how-to guides? Reviews? Interviews? Lists? It might not be what you write about, but how you write which sets you apart.Identify your own interests and passions \u2013 While all of the above are important, there's no point in blogging about something you have zero interest in. You'll quickly get bored and people will spot your lack of enthusiasm. Write about something you really, truly care about.",

            "answer_text": "While having a blog setup is one thing, it is a whole new ballgame when profitability is considered. If you have a blog, you may not realize just how much money you can make simply by tweaking a few attributes on your site and getting connected with the right people. From a few dollars to thousands, there are many different ways that your site can work for you, making you money while you continue to write and share what it is that you enjoy with the world. If you are interested in making your blog work for you, consider the following as some guidelines about how your creative or informational outlet can also grow your back account. First, though, it is important to focus on the attributes that a blog should have in order to create the greatest chance for return on investment. Attribute 1: A Clear Point of View If you have a blog, you can write or share literally anything that you want. From political points of view to causes to thoughts and ideas, there is nothing that cannot be written or shared through a blog. Because of the free nature of many blogging sites, there are many topics that can be written about and discussed. But, if a page wants to make money, it needs to be coherent in its messaging and its direction. People are less likely to stay involved with or invested in a blog that does not have a clear message or focus. Even worse, those that post contradictory information can see their audience decline which hurts profitability chances. Thus, those who want to make money through their blogs should make sure they know and understand what it is that they are trying to say.  Attribute 2: An Audience Marketers and affiliates want to reach as many people as possible with their advertisements with as little cost on branding as possible. Therefore, to increase likability and potential for cross-marketing through blogging, it is good to have a solid and active fan base already attached to your blog. While free is good, it is encouraged that those who want to see the investment in their blog and their potential for large return on investment have an established audience or one that is growing. Attribute 3: Interesting Content Advertisers are also more interested in connecting with blogs that are likely to retain their audience, or build it. The best way to do this is to have interesting and engaging content produced on a regular basis. That means that those who want to build a blog should provide the content that is going to drive people to come to their page and also catch the eyes of advertisers and potential investors. This interesting content will help to get a page noticed among traffic, get shared, and likely end up on the desk of a blogging backer that wants to connect itself to that page. This becomes especially true for niche bloggers which have a unique opportunity to connect with advertisers that can connect their products to a page that backs their point of view or is congruent with their messaging. Subscription Services While you may want to keep everything free to your web traffic and readers/viewers with your blog, there are some very lucrative ways to earn money by asking for a small fee from your traffic. Subscription services are very popular on blogs and can be a great way to earn some extra income while creating an environment that still offers the level of interest and engagement that you crave with your readers. Subscription services have many benefits to both bloggers and their audience. Firstly, they allow bloggers like you to make extra income. Even if it\u2019s only a nominal fee for the subscription services, this amount can reap amazing amounts if looked at on the larger scale. A few dollars a month or even a year from your traffic across hundreds of people can earn thousands in your pocket. Therefore, it should be looked at as a potentially worthwhile endeavor when it comes to making money from your blog. Further, subscription services are a great way to release premium content to your traffic. Whether it is through an exclusive newsletter, first access to information, or other perks, having a subscription service attached to your page will show your followers that you have a vested interested in giving them the content they want and crave. It also allows you to connect with those who are willing to go the extra step in interacting with your page to feel rewarded. Finally, though not an exhaustive list, another reason that blog administrators are absolutely loving the idea of subscription services is because as much as it provides a profit stream for your audience, it also creates an investment. Your traffic is making an investment in your blog and, thus, is going to take a more active interest in it. Those that are invested monetarily are more likely to share what you are providing, discuss with friends and family, and recommend your page. Therefore, while you make money off of their purchase, you are encouraging marketing as well. Advertiser\u2019s Corner If you have ever been to a website or webpage, you are likely to notice that there is more than just the content produced and run by the company on it. Instead, there are often external businesses that will place an advertisement on a page in order to garner support and exposure for their product. These requests do not rely on click through payment alone. Instead, there is a flat fee paid in order for such advertisement to happen. That means that a blogger does not have to worry about a per-click commission but can simply sell space on his or her site for a steady and consistent price. Whether a one-time fee or per month cost, this advertisement space is a great way to make money without having to put a great deal of effort into it. Further, because the advertisement is coming from a third party business, there is no need to worry about graphic design either. All you have to do is post the content and start earning money. It really is that simple! The Affiliate Boost Popular blogs can be more than just eye-catching and interesting to the readers who enjoy its content. Blogs that have a strong fan base can be very interesting to advertisers who want to make sure that their products or items are associated with trending technological outputs. It is not unheard of, then, for advertisers and other businesses to contact a blogger to become a part of their affiliate program. Affiliates are those enterprises that pay a blogger to post an interactive banner or other advertisement on his or her site. Usually, this type of marketing involves a pay-per-click agreement in which the blogger (you) is paid by an affiliate (the advertiser) whenever the blog\u2019s traffic clicks that advertisement. The amount of money that is exchanged will depend entirely on the agreement between you and the affiliate. There are several different programs of this nature being used by bloggers to make what is essentially passive income. It is a great way that your blog can make money for you without having to worry about expending a great deal of effort. For those that are unsure of where to go to get connected with this type of affiliate, there are groups online and through simple internet searches that work together to attach themselves to each other\u2019s pages. These affiliate programs are highly interesting and lucrative and can be a built in network for those that want to start using others to promote their pages. Another great way to connect with other affiliates is to reach out to them. This can be done through face to face interactions or through marketing online. Either way, the opportunities are out there and can be extremely financially rewarding for those who are willing to expend a little energy on making those connections.  Cross-Promote Your Products and Services If you have a blog that is centered around a service or product, you are going to have an amazing opportunity to earn extra money through cross-promotion. By utilizing your blog to encourage people to buy a product or service from your enterprise, you are boosting your chances of making a sale and adding monies to your pocket at the same time. This is simple and relatively easy as you already know and understand your products and services. Simply use backlinks in your blog that lead to product sales pages or encourage service purchases and you will have a second stream of income directly to yourself. If you do not yet have a store or online site that sells products, consider low cost options that are little expense to you while providing great returns. T-shirt, bumper stickers, and e-books are a great way to create a product line that is not expensive but can be very lucrative. Further, when you do create such a platform, you are encouraging marketing and thus, building a great audience all while putting money in your pocket. A key tip for new bloggers and those without a product line is this: make sure that the products that you offer solve a problem. Fluff products are great for established blogs but it is best that those who are working on a new blog put their efforts into creating services and other items that are going to serve a purpose in an individual\u2019s life. This helps to connect the dots and encourages the audience to buy more which, in turn, puts more money in your bank account. Webinars and Web Series Another great way to earn money through your blog is to offer individuals the chance to pay for information. But, this information should be built around a new way to tell them what you are already hinting at in your traditional blog posts. Webinars are a great way to share information to web traffic and provide them with an opportunity to learn in (what feels like) a classroom setting. Whether you are offering a pre-recorded webinar that can be watched at any time it\u2019s purchased or one that has a set time, this video format is a great way to have people pay for what you can provide. For those that are new to webinars, it is important that you understand the value that these information sessions can bring to your page. You can charge hundreds of dollars for a webinar but this webinar should be produced well and should look sophisticated. This helps individuals to feel like they are getting more bang for their buck and hint at the expertise that you have in the subject arena in which you are writing. From tutorials to videos to classes, this is the way to go for those that want to earn money on their blogs with little effort. Start Right Away While having an audience is great and essential to catching the big marketers and lucrative deals, those that want to start earning money through their blog should make use of the above steps from the moment they set up a page. If you want to make money, you need to keep this in mind as you create the mission and the content of your page from the very first post. This will help to give you clear guidelines and help to ensure that you get noticed in the future and set you up for success. Happy blogging!  More info at: http://Build-ur-Blog.com ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, the age-old question\u2026How can I turn my passion into a source of income? Actually, a blog can be quite the lucrative project if handled properly. The first step would be to make sure that you\u2019re seeing a decent amount of inbound traffic. There are a few things that you can do to help in that area. \u00b7 Do your keyword research. You might have an idea of what you want to write about (and if you\u2019re starting a blog, you should) but did you know that you can greatly increase the likelihood of someone finding you by doing a little keyword research before you write? For example, you may want to write about Software as a Service, but find that there\u2019s a lot of people searching for \u2018How the industry is shifting to adopt Software as a Service\u2019. This longer tail keyword is more specific, but you\u2019re likely to attract more engaged traffic with it. \u00b7 Optimize. Using your keyword and optimizing for social media will allow people to find you. Think about how people interact with the internet. If they\u2019re looking for a solution to a problem, more often than not they\u2019ll type their question into Google. Well, if you\u2019ve properly optimized your blog post, then hopefully you\u2019ll show up. The higher your ranking, the more likely someone is to click on your post. If you\u2019re running a Wordpress site, there are plugins like Yoast SEO that you can use to improve the optimization of your content. \u00b7 Advertise. Ever hear the old saying \u2018you have to spend money to make money\u2019? We don\u2019t necessarily want to spend money, but with digital marketing, it\u2019s almost a necessity. Putting some money behind a social ad or a PPC campaign is a great way to get more traffic to your blog, which you can hopefully turn into conversions. \u00b7 Get social. Publishing your content on platforms like Twitter and Facebook are a great way of reaching an existing audience, as well as potentially expanding your reach to people who haven\u2019t heard of you before. \u00b7 Post frequently. The more regularly you\u2019re posting, the higher Google\u2019s algorithm will rank you. Ensure that you\u2019re including calls to action in your blog posts to get your prospects to take the action you want them to, and include internal links to guide them through other blog posts until they\u2019re ready to make a decision on your product or service. If you\u2019re running a B2B blog or website, then you might consider using a website visitor tracker as well. Clickback WEB identifies companies that visit your site \u2013 even when they don\u2019t convert \u2013 and provides you with their decision makers\u2019 contact information. This will allow you to monetize your blog, as you\u2019ll be able to reach out to these contacts and follow up with them to address any concerns that might have caused them to leave. It should also give you some further insight into they type of people that are visiting your site so that you can adjust your buyer persona and content accordingly to appeal to the right audience to improve conversions. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Disclaimer: I work for Clickback. ",

            "answer_text": "Listen. I\u2019ve been blogging from 2013. I started dozens of sites, some of them failed and some of them succeeded. I\u2019ve tried most of the monetization strategies out there when it comes to blogging. I tried and tested many things. Some of them worked, some of them didn\u2019t. Many people think that there\u2019s some secret that pros are hiding from you and that is preventing you from earning good money from your blog. No. Listen. There\u2019s nothing called \u201csecret\u201d. You need to put the right kind of effort, that\u2019s the secret to success. Here are some ways to earn money blogging: Ad Revenue Being a blogger, if you have good traffic you can place the relevant advertisements on your blog by applying for platforms like: Google AdSenseMedia(net)Propeller AdsRevContentOthersGoogle AdSense is the best way to monetize your high traffic website. Because Google with it\u2019s a huge amount of data knows about the psychographics of every internet user and shows them ads that are hyper-relevant to them. Affiliate Marketing With affiliate marketing, you promote the products of other people and earn a good chunk of commission out of it. The commission range anywhere between 5% to 100% (you heard it right!) depending upon the niche that you\u2019re in. This is my favorite. Because 80% of my income comes through affiliate marketing apart from my agency business. I\u2019ve tried both Ad revenue and affiliate marketing model. For me, affiliate marketing worked great and seemed lucrative. Coaching and Training You can also offer training courses and training for people in the niche you are blogging in. The fact is that you are already showcasing your expertise in the niche you\u2019re blogging in. All you need to have is a consultation or training page on your website. According to the report, the eLearning industry has set to reach $325 billion by 2025. If you want a sweet pie of the eLearning market, it\u2019s your time to create training courses and offer consultation online. Training courses You can host your training courses on platforms like Udemy or on self-hosted platforms like Teachable. Apart from training courses, you can also offer consultation and mentoring on your blog as I described you earlier. Ramit Sethi recently launched his training course that made $5m in a week as reported by John Havel from TheHustle.co. Memberships Apart from the training courses, you can also consider offering premium content to your audience in the form of memberships. In turn for a small monthly fee, you\u2019ll be offering them great content that they can\u2019t find easily on the web. Many bloggers and publications are doing the same. They gate the content behind a subscription form. This is also called \u201cContent gating\u201d. Sponsored advertisements As your blog begins to grow, you\u2019ll receive dozens of emails every day by product owners willing to publish sponsored advertisements on your blog. Hi {{name}}, I\u2019m Joe from {{examplebrand}}. I recently came across your product {{product}}. Really an awesome product. I really loved how it does {{feature1}} and {{feature2}} without much hassle. I couldn\u2019t help but sign up for the product and decided to test it out. I absolutely loved the tool. Now, I\u2019ve decided to create an in-depth review of the tool on my site, shout it out to my social media followers, and also email list of 10k subscribers. Let me know if you are interested in taking this further. Cheers, Joe. On the other hand, you can also outreach the product owners directly for sponsored advertisement requests. Offer services If you have a fairly popular blog in your niche, you can consider offering services that your target audience find it useful. For example, if you have a blog related to Digital Marketing you can offer services like: Website auditSEO servicesOutreach servicesWeb design servicesBlog managementWordPress customizationLanding page designPPC advertisementsMuch moreFor crafting the kind of services you want to provide, first you need to determine what kind of people are visiting your blog and whether they really need the kind of service you are offering through surveys and feedback. Flipping websites/blogs  Do you know that there are people who grow websites to say $500/month, and sell it for up to 20x the amount at like $10,000? They do this at scale, and earn a lot more money than other bloggers who stick to their personal websites and not sell it? They treat the website flipping as flipping apartments and sites \u2013 they call it the virtual real estate. Personally, if you ask me till date (as of writing this blog post) I\u2019ve flipped only 2 websites as I was finding difficult to run and manage them. First one, I sold it for like $2700ish and the second one for $500ish. Many people like Greg Nunan flipped over combined value over $84k all up, and he has documented his lessons in a guest post on CloudLiving run by Tung Tran. One more example is Chris Guthri from UpFuel who sold a website for $55,000 in 20 months. Read my EPIC blog post on this - How to Earn Money Blogging?

            "answer_text": "TLDR; any way is a good way ;) On a more serious note, there are many ways to make money as a blogger, but they all rely on one thing \u2014 traffic. A new blog isn\u2019t going to have a lot of traffic, and so isn\u2019t going to make a lot of money. A new blog from a known blogger might be able to pull in sponsorship, as long as it\u2019s related and linked to from an existing high-authority site, but for most bloggers this is only a pipe dream. Which leaves us with: Affiliate sales (i.e. Amazon, ClickBank, JVZoo, etc.)Own sales (i.e. PDFs through SendOwn, Distribly or PayLoadz, or physical products)Advertising Sales (i.e. via AdSense or a related programme, or spots sold right off your page)To make any money from these, you need to keep a close eye on three metrics: New Sessions > how many new visitors are you getting;Repeat Sessions > how many visitors keep coming back;Conversion Rate > how many visitors become customers.My advice would be to not jump on the monetization band wagon until your blog scores highly on New Sessions and Repeat Sessions. If you have existing CTAs that generate (for example) sign-ups, then if the conversion rate (visitor to action) is reasonable, that\u2019s also a good sign that your traffic isn\u2019t just passive. Increasing conversion rates is often heavily linked to correct keyword research. Some topics just don\u2019t lend themselves to attracting visitors who already have their wallet in their hands, and the trick is to finds those keyword phrases that pull in highly converting traffic. \u201cBest\u201d is also pretty subjective. What works for one blog may not work for another. Testing is the only way you\u2019ll find out for sure!

            "answer_text": "Blogging is a big source of earning money these days. Gone are the days when blogging was usually considered as a form of passive income. Now, many people take up blogging as a full-time job and they are earning a decent regular income. Many freelance bloggers make money by writing articles or by publishing their content on various websites. There are bloggers who have created a name and place for themselves solely by frequently blogging on their field of expertise. Source: How To Make Money As A Blogger So, you can think of starting a blog with the intention of earning money. But you need to follow some basics of a successful blogging career. Your blog must engage your target audience from start to finish. If the stuff you are posting is boring, nobody is going to revisit your blogging site, which also means no earnings from the site. Try to create a blog that people finding interesting. Create blog posts on the topic on which you carry an expertise from own experience. To make money, you can then build a solid community of audience around your blog. The issues you raise in the blog should be relevant to the people\u2019s daily lives and societies. Once you have built a blog, ascertain that it has a good social media presence. Create a newsletter also that your audience can subscribe to so that they can get your new blog post on time.

            "answer_text": "If you're looking to start a blog, be prepared to earn no money. That's correct. You won't earn money as a blogger. Not in the beginning at least. Not unless you're a social media star with millions of followers or a semi-celebrity that already has an audience or a platform. If you're a so-called newbie, be prepared to experience some pain. I don't say this to dissuade you from blogging. Not one bit. In fact, if you're looking to start a blog and earn a respectable income as a blogger, there are certain steps that you can take to succeed and actually exit the rat race. But it won't be quick. And it certainly won't be easy whatsoever. The unfortunate truth is that there are no shortage of internet marketers (IMs), who will jump up and down to sell you the latest system that will make you rich by catapulting you to the top of Google's search results. Well, it doesn't quite work that way. There is no shortcut. There is no hack. You have to put in the time and do the work. As someone who teaches about SEO, I can tell you that you'll be facing a long road when you first start a blog. There is a tremendous amount of information that you need to grasp on the technical side of blogging, and you need to seamlessly integrate that with your creative approach. In short, there's a steep learning curve. However, to the victors go the spoils. Those that start a blog and don't actually quit, continuing to push forward, make tremendous amounts of income over time. Not overnight. Nothing good comes quickly. You'll have to put in the work. But this is by far one of the best ways that you can make money online as long as you understand what you're doing. The fact is that there are approximately 1000 websites being created every minute of every day, with a large majority of those being blogs. So if you're starting a blog, you're likely starting a WordPress blog. Step #1 -- Decide On A Niche Step #2 -- Find A Good Domain Name Step #3 -- Select A Hosting Account Provider Step #4 -- Install WordPress Step #5 -- Configure Accelerated Mobile Projects (AMP) Pages Step #6 -- Setup Google Analytics Step #7 -- Write Keyword-Focused Content Step #8 -- Decide On An Income Stream Step #9 -- Build A Value Ladder And Sales Funnel Step #10 -- Keep Going. Give it time. Everything good comes in time. Keep in mind that email marketing is where the gold is. But it doesn't happen without a large volume of subscribers. You need tens of thousands of active subscribers to make a very significant income through email marketing efforts. And that doesn't happen quickly no matter what anyone tries to tell you. The truth? Making money from blogging won't be easy. People will sell you a dream, but those hopes will be dashed 6 months or a year into your endeavor. However, the biggest difference between the blogs that make outlandish income and those that fail are the simple fact that the people who don't stop ultimately reach their goals. ",

That\u2019s what an internet hosting company will do for you. during this step, you\u2019ll be selecting the blogging platform and web hosting plan you\u2019ll use to urge your blog online. What is web hosting? How much does web hosting cost? What's the best web hosting service to use? The combination of blogging platform & web hosting I personally use (and that the majority other bloggers use) may be a WordPress blog, hosted by Bluehost. WordPress may be a free publishing platform that\u2019s been around since 2003 and now powers quite 60% of all blogs on the web . Bluehost is one among the foremost established, reliable companies within the blog hosting industry. this mix is what we\u2019ll be using to start out your blog. Now, let\u2019s get your hosting found out . \u2014> Click here to go over to Bluehost and hit the green \u201cGet Started Now\u201d button Bluehost Web Hosting (Screenshot of Homepage) to settle on a reputation and find out how to start out a Blog Choose your plan First, you\u2019ll select a hosting plan (inputting your blog name comes next). Personally, i like to recommend choosing the selection Plus plan because it comes with Domain Privacy, which can protect your personal information (your full name, email address, telephone number and residential address) from being published anywhere online. Choosing your plan will appear as if this right here. Just click the green \u201cSelect\u201d button on your plan of choice: How to Select the proper Hosting Plan for Your Blog (Bluehost Screenshot) Process As I said above, i like to recommend choosing the selection Plus plan, in order that you\u2019re getting the Domain Privacy feature that\u2019ll protect your personal information online, but any of those plans will do as you\u2019re starting your blog\u2014and you'll add the domain privacy in later during the checkout process for around $1/mo. Pick your blog\u2019s name Next, you\u2019ll get to the page where it\u2019s time to settle on your blog\u2019s domain name: Create an Account and Getting Your name with Bluehost to Host Your Blog Once you get to the present step within the checkout process, just type within the name of the name that you\u2019d like your blog to possess (mine is A Blog by Ryan Robinson: Learn to Blog and Make Money on the Internet). If you would like to run a fast search to ascertain if your name is out there , you'll roll in the hay quickly right here: Check if your name is available: Search for available domain names... SEARCH DOMAINS If your name of choice isn\u2019t available, you'll either try an alternative choice that involves mind\u2014or (what I recommend) select the choice to settle on your name later after getting the remainder of your account squared away and taking a touch longer to think the name through. Plus, afterward down during this guide, I expand some more on the way to choose the proper name for your blog if you\u2019re not decided yet. Here\u2019s where you'll click to settle on your domain later (it\u2019s a popup which will appear if you hover on this page for long enough or move your mouse up toward the highest of the page): How to Choose Your name for Your Blog Later if you cannot Decide After either choosing your name or opting to pick it later, you\u2019ll be taken to the ultimate step within the check in process\u2014creating your account. Create your Bluehost account Start by filling in your account details like your name, email address (it\u2019s super important to use an up-to-date email address because this is often where your login details and account information are going to be sent) and address. If you don\u2019t want to enter your information manually, you'll connect your Bluehost account together with your Google account. Either works! Filling Our Your Account Information on Bluehost (Screenshot) to urge Blog Hosting Select the proper hosting package This is where you\u2019ll choose an account plan supported the worth you would like to lock in and the way far beforehand you\u2019ll pay. Selecting Your Package Details and Blog Hosting Plan Duration (Screenshot) Note that Bluehost only offers options for you to pay 1, 2, 3 or 5 years upfront. They don\u2019t offer a monthly payment option (because most hosting companies that do offer monthly payments tend to charge a touch more). Even still, with whichever plan you select , the worth works bent be an excellent deal for starting your own blog and getting it online today. Which pricing plan is best to start out a blog with? Personally, i like to recommend choosing the \u201cPrime 36 Month Price\u201d if you would like to lock within the lowest possible price for your hosting. That\u2019s what i exploit . And it secures your blog hosting at their lowest rate (and gets you domain privacy) for subsequent 3 years. and since this low pricing for brand spanking new customers only applies to the primary payment you create , if you were to settle on the 1-year plan, your pricing may go up then first year. That\u2019s why if you select the 36-month plan, your pricing are going to be locked in at this rate for 3 years. For that reason, i like to recommend going with the longest duration plan that your budget can spring for. Choosing the proper package extras (skip about one) Choose the proper Package Extras with Hosting with Bluehost I recommend keeping the Domain Privacy Protection extra, but you'll escape with skipping the remainder . afterward during this guide, I\u2019ll show you the various free and cheap plugins & tools you'll use for things like SEO optimization, additional security and site back-ups, rendering most of the opposite package extras not necessary. As i discussed earlier though, having the domain privacy extra keeps all of your personal contact information (your name, email, telephone number and address) private. Now, if you chose the selection Plus Plan on the previous screen, then your Domain Privacy Protection are going to be listed as \u201cFree\u201d a bit like this screenshot above shows\u2014it\u2019s included therein plan. If you chose a Basic or Plus Plan, then you\u2019ll want to see the box to feature Domain Privacy Protection to your order for around $1/mo. The total you\u2019ll now see is that the amount you\u2019re getting to pay today. Remember though, you won\u2019t need to pay again for 1, 2, 3 or 5 years counting on the package you chose. Plus, there\u2019s a 30-day a refund guarantee just in case things don\u2019t go as planned together with your blog. Enter your billing information Final Step of Billing Information on Bluehost (Payment Information Screenshot) Example Now you\u2019ll input your billing information, check the box that you simply comply with Bluehost\u2019s Terms of Service then hit the green \u201cSubmit\u201d button. Woo! It\u2019s time for a mini celebration \ud83d\ude42 You\u2019ve officially completed the primary major step in starting a blog.

The 2 best alternative blog hosting platforms worth considering Dreamhost \u2014 I\u2019ve hosted literally dozens of internet sites on Dreamhost over the years (and I still do). All similar features like 1-click WordPress install, free SSL certificate and site security aside, one among the most important pros of going with Dreamhost compared to other hosting companies, is that they provide a real pay-per-month plan that permits you to buy the value of your blog hosting monthly with no strings attached. Here are a couple of other web hosting companies that also offer monthly payment plans. HostGator \u2014 The thing that sets HostGator aside from other hosting companies, is their fantastic level of customer support and therefore the incontrovertible fact that they also offer a real monthly payment plan (which helps if you\u2019re starting your blog on a budget).

Yes, there are paid opportunities out there in writing and blogging but they tend to be easier to get when you can show a writing history and a list of people who\u2019ve come to read your work. It is good to have a niche in mind from the get-go but it is also fine if you don\u2019t have the exact space figured out from the beginning. You\u2019ll figure that out as you go. Some people can do research ahead of time and pick a niche and stick with it; others sort of fall into it as they write and find one that not only works for them but gets attention from readers. When it comes to money-making and marketing typical methods will include affiliate marketing and things like Google\u2019s Adsense. If you have rights to your domain, you can have Google\u2019s on your blog from the beginning but you likely won\u2019t see a profit until after you consistently get 20 or more views per day. Affiliate marketing like through Amazon really needs to have reached such a viewership level to be of use - I\u2019m speaking from experience here as I jumped onto that one prematurely. What\u2019s more, if Amazon doesn\u2019t see enough traffic on the links you provide in the earlier months of use, you could lose all money-making from it for several months before being allowed to make another attempt (be sure to check their process thoroughly before use). Of course, there are other opportunities to make money on your blog. Some will come your way via marketing agencies in your email - just watch out for scams - and others you will have to seek out. You truly get out of it what you put into it. Lastly, none of the blog-building or money-making happens overnight. Be patient and persistent and it\u2019ll come. It also helps to be always learning!

            "answer_text": "Once you have successfully completed a few articles which have generated a good amount of traffic, you can make money blogging. There are people who write because it\u2019s their passion and they have no intention to generate income blogging. The choice is yours. Here, we will be discussing 6 different ways to monetize your blogs. You can choose whichever suits you. 1. Google Adsense Adsense is Google\u2019s advertising service program which generates and gives more than 90% of its revenue. It helps publishers like you to earn money by placing ads on their websites and blogs. It is very simple, free and you don\u2019t need coding skills to benefit from this. You need to be very careful though because Google has its own terms and conditions and violating that will lead to forfeiting your Adsense account and you\u2019ll lose all the money you have earned. This is actually one of the easiest ways you can choose to earn money but the return you get is comparatively low unless you have a solid audience. Google AdSense can be a good start and a relatively easier way to monetize your blogs. 2. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate Marketing is the process where an affiliate (people like you) earn a fixed percentage of commission by promoting and bringing sales to the company. It could either be a product or service. This is one of the best ways to earn passive income. This works best even if you don\u2019t have much more traffic on your blog. If your website is under a specific niche, you will always find affiliate products in that niche. It is one of the best and profitable ways to earn through your blog without inventing the new wheel. If your audience is finding your content valuable, it\u2019s a good time to think for yourself too. If you don\u2019t know what to promote on your blogs, just go to Google and search affiliate programs with your niche name for example \u2013 [ blogging affiliate programs]. Don\u2019t be too greedy with the commission rate you see out there. Just be loyal to your audience and recommend only those products which you think might be helpful to your audience. It will be a win-win for both of you. All you need to do is to attach an affiliate link. Pat Flynn, Neil Patel, Darren Rowse are some of the big names in the affiliate marketing industry. 3. Sell your own products and services e-books courses or digital products When you\u2019re blogging, your primary focus should be building an audience. And based on what the audience needs you can create courses or sell books or sell your services. If you do it the other way, there are high chances of failing. You can take their opinions through emails, google forms, comments, or many different ways. Here are the 5 different ways a) E-books The 2015 report says e-books selling has hit $9 billion and seems to keep growing. All you need is a problem you want to solve for your audience. In fact, many bloggers now include e-books selling in their stream of income. You can anytime write valuable content to your audience or for all with the help of book writing software and publish it on your blog, and sell it for a few dollars. You can choose other platforms to sell your Ebooks. Through this, you can make $2000 per month by making a sale of 200 ebooks for $10 each. b) Online courses This may not suit everyone because to create their own courses they need to have good knowledge and understanding about the topics they are going to teach. It requires some sort of expertise. Also, it needs some time to design, create, and document your content in-depth in digital form. Once it is done you can start promoting it on your blog or various other platforms too. Slowly you watch your content being bought on these platforms on a regular basis and you earn recurring money with these if you have really created a good online course. Selling Online courses can be much profitable way to monetize your blogs. c) Monetize your blogs by selling Digital products/tools This doesn\u2019t seem as easy as it looks. It will take a lot of effort to make something that really provides value for your audience and solves their problem. One it\u2019s done, you should keep upgrading it based on the bugs found. Ubersuggest, AHREF, SEMRush are all digital marketing tools. They make more than 200$ for every sale they make. This value depends on the product. Premium products cost much more than this. d) Other products/services As the name suggests you can sell your own products/services. If you have nurtured your audience well, you could possibly make good sales. e) Consulting Consulting is nothing but helping or advising somebody to scale or improvise their business or product/service. It entirely depends on what your blog is about. If your blog is career-related, then your consultancy will be to help a student and guide him in his career. A Business consultant, you will consult on issues related to sales or marketing or any other business development related functions. A design consultant will be advising and giving suggestions to improve the design of the product. You don\u2019t have to be an expert to do consulting. But you need to be knowledgeable and have some experience. Through consultancy, you can make even up to $100 per phone/skype. You just have to advise them or do any other similar task. 4. Monetizing your blogs through Banner Ads on your page This is an easy monetizing method. You can consider consulting other people/companies and advertise using banners on your website. You can charge them based on the placement of ads and based on the traffic you\u2019re having. Try to advertise relevant products/services as much as possible. You must be familiar with this method and have been watching a lot of blogs being monetized through ads. There are many Advertisement networks through which you can start showing ads and monetize your blogs. 5. Email Marketing Email marketing is sending commercial intent messages to your target audience using emails. It usually involves using emails to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, and brand awareness. Email marketing can be the best among all the marketing methods that you implement and it will never get old. This is the safest way. Do you know why? It\u2019s because none of the social media like Instagram or Facebook is in your hands and your account may get banned anytime. The website also is not in your hands. It can get banned too. Step 1: Build an email list Collecting emails is like collecting phone numbers of people. You never lose it unless you want to delete it. You have to find your unique way to collect email addresses. One way is to make promos and offers. And once done you can usually send emails to all your subscribers whenever you post new content or when you want to talk to them about a unique strategy. You can use tools to track your emails. As it is said, money is in your list. Step 2: Writing good emails Learn how to write effective emails. These include The clear, direct subject lineIncluding a Signature blockUsing exclamation points sparinglyUsing Classic fontsAvoiding shortcutsYour email is a reflection of you. The better the emails you write, the better the chances of attracting customers, the better the chances of earning. All professional conversations are made through the mail and most of the people/organization in this world has an email. According to reports, US employees receive an average of 126 emails every day. Your email would be just one amongst them. You have to create your unique ideas and creativity and implement your skills to attract readers. Step 3: Call for Action Email marketing campaigns have the best conversion rate and you get loyal and paying customers through this. Returns on investment are very high with email marketing compared to all other strategies. You have to find your own sales funnel for this. People would hesitate to buy your product with just one mail. You keep sending them valuable emails and then one day you can try to sell your product/service. Your email funnel could be 4-5 mails or it could be more than that. The choice is yours. You can use tools to automate emails. If things aren\u2019t working out, try to change your strategies. 6. Sponsored posts/reviews Gone are the days of traditional marketing! We are now living in a digital world. And therefore, the marketing trends have been shifted to digital platforms. You can not deny the fact that Digital marketing has a higher rate of returns than Traditional Marketing. When was the last time you saw a product on TV or on the newspaper and then bought it? The number one thing anybody does before buying a product is they check it on the internet and then they end up buying it from there itself. You have to find people who want to publicize their products or services through your blog. And once done you can run a sponsored blog for them which will increase their outreach. You need to try to contact people related to your field and make money for a sponsored blog you make. You can have a blog written exclusively to market their product. Conclusion : Blogging is still considered one of the best ways to make money. It\u2019s because the investment here is very less. However, generating income through money isn\u2019t that easy as you think. Understand your audience, their needs, and act accordingly. It\u2019s not necessary to have millions of visitors to monetize your blogs. You just need to channelize your existing visitors. One thing that you always keep in mind is to provide value to your audience. It helps to increase your recognition and you can easily monetize. The more people you help, the more money you make. As simple as that. Everything takes time. So be patient, be consistent, and work hard.

            "answer_text": "Blogging is one of the popular means of earning money online and also one of the most strenuous. But don\u2019t fret, I\u2019m gonna outline 10 non strenuous methods of making money blogging below so you can think less about the stress and focus more on earning. 1. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is when you recommend a product or service to your audience using special tracking links, and then get a referral commission for every time someone buys after clicking your link. 2. Google Adsense Google Adsense is an easy way to make money from your blog. All you need to do is add a script from Google to your website and start displaying ads. You will get paid for every time a user clicks on the ad. These are called CPC ads. CPC stands for \u201ccost per click.\u201d By displaying CPC ads with Google Adsense, you receive a set fee every time a visitor clicks on an ad. 3. Sell Private Ads Working with advertising networks isn\u2019t your only option when it comes to selling ads. If you end up with enough traffic, advertisers may come directly to you and ask you to place their ad on your site. You can also contact advertisers yourself. The biggest difference from the above mentioned option is that there is no middle man, which means you can set your own ad rates. 4. Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products like eBooks Online courses/workshops Images, video, music etc. 5. Sell Memberships Another option to make money is to sell memberships to exclusive corners of your website. For instance, a career blog might charge $10 per month for users to gain access to their job board. 6. Services Some bloggers use expertise related to their blog topic and get paid when others hire them. Services can be offered locally or virtually like Speaking, Consulting, Graphic Design, Web Design, Tutoring etc. 7. Sell Physical products You can also sell physical products via your blog products like Books, Handmade Products, Manufactured Products etc. ",

However, today I\u2019m going to discuss a bit more about how to make money from a blog in 2018. Many people don\u2019t understand that starting a blog and making a real money from it are two different things. Remember, starting a blog is a quite easy task today but growing it up and monetizing your time/efforts may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. If you search for the term, \u201chow to create a blog\u201d, you\u2019ll get thousands of websites and fully actionable stuff. Right from picking your niche and appropriate domain + web hosting to installing WordPress and customizing it, you\u2019ll get the help for everything on the web. Not just blog posts but free video tutorials too. It\u2019s because most of these sites use affiliate marketing where they get paid to refer you some products and service including domain names, web hosting, themes & plugins and other blogging tools. But have you thought about making money off a blog? With a lot of enthusiasm and desire to make money online, many people start a blog but only a few continue their journey after one or two years.? This happens because they don\u2019t earn a significant amount of money from their blog. If you\u2019re one of them or want to start your blogging journey without the failures, you must read the complete article. It\u2019s an action-packed piece of content that you\u2019re going to love. In case, you\u2019re already earning a good amount, it\u2019s a great to hear and I\u2019d like to know your journey. However, I have mentioned here total 11 methods to monetize your blog even if you haven\u2019t earned a single dime online. Do you want to see those methods? Here they are. Google AdSense You might have heard about making money online using Google AdSense but it may not be working for you. Remember, Google AdSense is a CPC based advertising networks. Google shares a part of its revenue with content creators and publishers. When people visit your blog/website and click on the AdSense ads, you get paid for every valid click.  But, it does not work well for every niche. To be successful on AdSense platform, you need an authority blog with a ton of visitors every single day, proper keywords research for getting a good CPC, viral contents or extremely targeted audience who have positive buying intent and click on the ads naturally. If you\u2019re blogging in specific niches like News, Fashion, Travel, etc. and getting more than 1000 visitors per day, then it\u2019s good time show AdSense ads to your users. However, you also need to follow Google AdSense guidelines and post blog contents regularly to get a decent amount of money from your blog. I don\u2019t use this monetization method aggressively, but it could be great for some people having a load of traffic. To get AdSense approval, you need to understand a few things mentioned below: Follow Google AdSense Content Quality guidelinesWrite unique and original contents that help people coming to your blog. Try to publish around 20+ decent articles before applying to AdSense.Don\u2019t use copied contents unless you\u2019re using them for reference. Plagiarized content mostly won\u2019t get AdSense approval. Try to avoid writing errors, if you\u2019re not good at writing, use premium contents or hire a freelance writer.Be real and be true. Add your genuine details like contact, address, etc. It helps to prove the authenticity of your publication.Add all necessary pages like About us, Contact (as mentioned in above point), ToS, Disclaimer, Privacy Policy and Sitemap.Site performance and visual appearance matter a lot too. Try getting a good web hosting which can accommodate the traffic you\u2019ll get without having downtime and use an AdSense Friendly theme to get an attractive layout which will further help you get more clicks. Apart from that, your site\u2019s loading time should be minimum (under 3 Sec.)Once you\u2019ve done this, just head over to Google AdSense\u2019s official site and apply with appropriate details. Within a next few days, AdSense team will review your application and revert back whether you\u2019re on board or not. If you follow the points mentioned above, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll definitely get AdSense approval. Remember: In some countries like India, you may need to wait at least 6 months before applying to Google AdSense. Many people also ask, \u201cHow to get ads on my blog?\u201d once they get AdSense approval. It totally depends on your efforts, content quality, publishing frequency, and qualified traffic that your blog/website receives. If you really want to make passive income working from home with Google AdSense, then you can learn more from the resources mentioned below. Earn Passive Income by Working from Home with Google AdsenseAdsense Crash Course 2017: Profit With Adsense WebsitesDisplay Banner Ads If you\u2019ve noticed, when you browse different blogs or websites, you might have seen some banners on those web pages. These banners are nothing but the display ads. Displaying banner ads is one of the best monetization methods for the big publications companies and blogs. These high-traffic sites charge a fixed amount of money from different advertisers who want to display the banner ads on their websites. Display banner advertising method works mostly on CPM (Cost Per Mille/Cost Per Thousand) basis or a monthly basis where advertisers make the upfront payments to display their ads on publisher blog/website. Websites like BuySellAds and AdClerks are a couple of the biggest marketplaces to buy and sell display banner ads. However, if you want to sell ad spaces and monetize your blog with display banners, you should be getting ~100K impressions per month to receive a significant amount of money. And, in many cases, they don\u2019t approve blogs on free platforms including Blogger, WordPress.com or Wix, etc. Viral niche blogs and news sites have a great opportunity to use this method. Here\u2019s a screenshot from BuySellAds price-chart for the different banner sizes to display ads on one of the publisher\u2019s sites (Android Central).  For the first banner, it\u2019s getting 4,029,000 est. impressions. Let\u2019s make a little calculation for this. Ad Area: Super Leaderboard Rising Star (970 X 250 Top Center) Est. impressions: 4,029,000/Month CPM: $20 Total Est. Earning (In $): (4,029,000/1000) X 20 = 80,580 This\u2019s an amount for a single banner. Now, you can easily find how much would be they earning with 3 more ad spaces. Remember, your hard work pays you in a long term. Paid Reviews Today, when you want to buy something online, you often get confused after seeing a variety of products or service. In such cases, you ask your friends or relatives for suggestions and most of the times they recommend you the best product according to your needs. But what\u2019d happen if you get a well-researched buying guide and suggestions from experts who know the topic well? You would definitely buy that product or service. Am I right? You might have seen so many buying guides and reviews articles similar to this that promote specific products/services. And, most of the reviews you see online are sponsored by a relevant business to market their product in front of the targeted audience. Many companies pay a big amount of money to the blog owners who have high-authority blogs to publish the positive reviews about the products. Yes! It\u2019s the harsh truth. However, we don\u2019t recommend to write only a bright side of the product or service you reviewing. If there\u2019re cons or some features are missing, then you must mention that also. It helps to build more trust among your visitors and make a long-term blogging. If you have a blog with a significant amount of traffic, then you can reach and pitch some companies in your niche for paid reviews. Tell them that you\u2019ll publish a review about their products or service and promote it with your blog\u2019s authority to get more exposure and maybe some sales. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate Marketing means referring your blog visitors to another website to either generate leads or sales for them where you get a part of revenue as an affiliate commission on CPL/CPS basis. It\u2019s my favorite method to monetize my blog. Suppose, you have a sound knowledge of laptops or PCs and have a blog on this niche, then you can promote affiliate products mainly laptops, PCs, accessories, etc. You have a ton of way to promote these products including writing How-to guides, product reviews or comparisons, listicles, etc. This method is a little bit different from the display banner ads and paid reviews which we have discussed above. In both methods mentioned earlier, you get a FIX AMOUNT either to display ad banners or write a paid review. However, affiliate marketing is different and mostly a performance-based method to make money with your blog. Being an affiliate marketer, you must be registered with the affiliate merchant company. On approval as an affiliate, you get your unique affiliate URLs and display creatives to promote on the web. You can get 1%-80% or even more on every successful referral tracked by the affiliate program. The unique tracking link or Affiliate ID tells the company that the particular sale is referred by you and they pay your commission once you reach minimum payout limit. Here\u2019s my affiliate link for promoting Bluehost web hosting http://bluehost.in/?utm_source=affiliate&a_aid=0e0d421e\u00a0In this case, 0e0d421e is my unique affiliate ID. So, when someone clicks on this link, Bluehost knows that the person is sent by me. On a monetization front, affiliate marketing is a great source of income for the bloggers who don\u2019t have their own products. Many bloggers including Pat Flynn, Matthew Woodward, Harsh Agrawal, etc. earn a great with affiliate marketing. To understand the basics of affiliate marketing and commonly used terms, you must read my previously written affiliate marketing guide. Video Blogging A popular and authority blog often ranks on the first page of Google and get a lot of clicks. While companies pay for review articles, these blogs also earn by video blogging. Most of you are familiar with video-sharing sites like YouTube, Dailymotion, etc. and watch different talks, tutorials or movies, etc. These sites get a ton of free visitors if your video rank for a particular keyword. In some cases, you may see exponential growth in engagement including a number of views, watch duration, likes, and shares. What\u2019d happen if you promote a sponsored or affiliate product there? Plus, you can embed these videos on your WordPress blog to get more benefits. How could be this possible? Take an example. You have a food blog where you post different recipe articles every day but people love to watch how that particular dish is cooked. Am I right? So, you can create a video and upload it to YouTube and then embed on your WordPress blog. By doing this, you can improve on-page duration to improve SEO, let people watch how to cook that dish in a real-time plus throw some affiliate offers related to that content. On another side, you will have a big YouTube channel growing and you can also start monetizing it through Google AdSense, sponsored videos or affiliate marketing, etc. Selling Your Products/Services If you have expertise in a particular niche, then you can build trust among people by providing real value. Once you succeed to get an authority, then you can easily promote and sell your own products or service. It doesn\u2019t matter you\u2019re a photographer, wedding planner, web designer or a digital marketer, you can sell any digital or physical product to your visitors.  The blog is a great source to drive SEO traffic, build a portfolio, generate qualified leads helping people to solve their problems, and then sell your products or services. E.g. Syed Balkhi from WPBeginner has built a great platform for WordPress tips and tutorials. While he promotes some affiliate products like Bluehost, MaxCDN, his own products including OptinMonster, WP Forms, Soliloquy Slider, Envira Gallery, etc. simply share a great part of his total revenue. Link Building Services Though search engine algorithms are evolving every day, the backlinks are still considered valuable for improving ranking and traffic. If you have an authority blog that\u2019s visited by thousands of visitors, then many companies in your niche will contact you to put their website link in your articles for SEO purpose. In such cases, you can write a relevant article and put the company\u2019s link in there with suitable context and appropriate anchor text. For a really good blog, you can charge somewhere a few dollars to a couple of hundred dollars to place an external link. To be safe in Google\u2019s eyes, you should not accept requests from extremely low-quality sites. Remember, you can use the similar strategy to get paid guest posts to your blog. Online Coaching Once your blog gets popular, it\u2019s easier to sell your knowledge via online training. With a blog, you can easily find the interest of your audience and create a course around it. Suppose, your audience needs help in SEO, then you can provide them some valuable and action-packed contents to improve their current ranking. Once they start noticing some positive changes, you can easily sell them your premium courses and build a substantial revenue stream. SEO guru Brian Dean, Neil Patel or even some renowned Indian blogger like Deepak K., Kulwant Nagi offer a lot of free stuff including case-studies, video tutorials and sell their courses around that topic. Membership Site Just like selling online courses, you can start a paid membership for your blog visitors to access premium contents. Don\u2019t get what I\u2019m saying? Just head over to Medium.com and it\u2019s a really big publication offering high-quality content on a daily basis. But if you observe, you\u2019ll notice that they have a paid membership too, for accessing premium contents. It\u2019s just an example, you can have a membership site in any niche where you can provide some free stuff in the blog section and ask to upgrade their plan to avail premium benefits. The major benefit of a membership site is that you can make substantial recurring income for a long period with a very little efforts on content management and promotion. There are many solutions available in the market to create a membership site, but you should give try to Ultimate Membership Pro or ARMember plugin if you want a feature-rich and beginner friendly WordPress plugin. If you do in a proper way, a membership site could prove to be the best way to monetize blog you write. CPA Marketing CPA (Cost Per Action/Cost Per Acquisition) is one of the top money-making methods that all famous internet marketers and bloggers use. In CPA marketing, you just need to drive your visitors to a specific page to make them take an appropriate action. The action could be filling up form, submitting their credit/debit card information for the trial offer or completing a survey. In this case, companies pay you just for people taking action. And, there\u2019s no need to sell the products/services. Email Marketing You might have heard many times that the money is in the list. Am I right? Yes! It\u2019s true. You can make a lot of money if you have a list of qualified leads who trust you. I\u2019m really grateful to Noah Kagan, A chief sumo at AppSumo for letting me understand the importance of email marketing. By following his advice, I\u2019ve started collecting the emails of my blog readers so that I can send them newsletters, offers, and deals that create a win-win situation for both of us and have some mutual benefits. Similarly, by giving away some freebies on your blog, you can entice people to opt-in your email list and make a healthy relationship by providing them valuable content on regular basis. Remember, you can\u2019t control search engine ranking, it depends on Google\u2019s secret algorithms. Social media traffic is also controlled by the respective companies. And, the paid traffic needs a significant amount money to display ads on various platforms where ROI is quite lesser than email marketing when we consider LTV (Lifetime Value) of a customer as a major metric. So, you must start building your email list if you really want to make money from your blog by sending them affiliate offers, selling your own products or anything that could get you paid. I know what you are thinking about. There\u2019s a major misconception that email marketing tools are very costly. Like other newbies, I used to think the same. Fortunately, this is not true. You can completely build an email marketing funnel using free tools like MailMunch, Icegram with the help of email services like MailChimp, Mad Mimi, and SendinBlue, etc. Once you reach a mark of minimum subscribers, then for scaling up your campaign or to access more features like automation, advanced segmentation, in-depth analysis, etc. you need a premium email marketing solution like GetResponse. And, to grow your list faster, you should not mind investing a little money in such essential tools and services. Now the actual question, \u201cHow to start email marketing to make money with my blog?\u201d There are two main parts of email marketing. The first one is lead capture where you need to lure people to opt-in your list by giving away them some free goodies. To make your work easier, you can use some lead plugins like ConvertPlus or Thrive Leads and anything freebie like an ebook, free course or templates, etc. For email service, you can use GetResponse which is absolutely gold-mine for email marketing beginners. It\u2019s one of the most loved and proven email marketing services in the world. Plus, it\u2019s affordable even for people having the limited budget plus you can get a lot of beneficial features like visual automation, landing pages, webinars and free tutorials to learn email marketing from the scratch. Do you really want to make your first dollar online with your blog and email marketing? Use GetResponse to get started for free. Create Account With GetResponse Final Words These are the few methods I have tried to make money with my blogs. Select and give a try to any one of the methods listed in this article. However, It may take a few months depending on your efforts, dedication, and strategy. Once you become a master over time, start adding your own tweaks and generate even more money from your blog. I hope this guide about making money blogging will make you comfortable if you have started recently or if you want to create a new blog from the scratch. I\u2019m damn sure that you\u2019ve liked these blog monetization methods, so please share this article with your friends who want to start blogging in 2018 and make money from it. ",

            "answer_text": "No matter which group you\u2019re in, making money with a blog \u2013 whether it\u2019s a hobby blog or a business blog \u2013is possible. It\u2019s not a get rich quick ordeal, but if you do it right, you could make enough to support your family and more. Let\u2019s dive in and see how you can make a profit with your blog. Monetize with CPC or CPM Ads One of the most common ways bloggers make money is through placing ads on their site. There are two popular types of ads: CPC/PPC Ads: Cost per click (also called pay per click) ads are usually banners that you place in your content or sidebar. Each time a reader clicks on the ad, you are paid for that click.CPM Ads: CPM Ads, or \u201ccost per 1,000 impressions,\u201d are ads that pay you a fixed amount of money based on how many people view your ad.Perhaps the most popular network for placing these types of ads is Google AdSense. With this program, you do not need to be in direct contact with advertisers; you simply place the banner on your site, Google chooses ads relevant to your content, and your viewers click on the ads. There are countless similar programs available if you find that AdSense doesn\u2019t work for you, such as Chitika, Infolinks, and Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide. Sell Private Ads Working with advertising networks isn\u2019t your only option when it comes to selling ads. If you end up with enough traffic, advertisers may come directly to you and ask you to place their ad on your site. You can also contact advertisers yourself. The biggest difference from the above mentioned option is that there is no middle man, which means you can set your own ad rates. Selling private ads can come in the form of banners, buttons, or links. You can even make money writing sponsored posts where you write about or give a review of an advertiser\u2019s product or service. Another option is to write an underwritten post or series, which is where you can write about any topic, but the advertiser pays for a \u201cBrought to you by\u201d mention in the content. The ways you make money with this can vary. For instance, you might charge a one-time fee for a link within a post. If you are hosting banner ads, you might charge your partner monthly. Bonus tip: To maximize your income, you can also choose to sell sponsorship space in your email newsletters, podcasts, and videos. Include Affiliate Links in Your Content Affiliate marketing is also another great tool for monetizing your blog. Here is how affiliate marketing works: An advertiser has a product she wants to sell. She agrees to give you a commission from each sale if the buyer is coming from your site.She gives you a unique link that tracks your affiliate code. That way, she knows when a buyer used your link to make a purchase.You include your affiliate link on your site. You can do this directly in the content or through banner ads. If a reader clicks on your unique link and buys the product you have recommended, you earn a percentage of what she purchased.You can utilize affiliate marketing through ad networks like Amazon Associates, or you can create private partnerships with advertisers and businesses with an affiliate program. Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesJust remember that if you are going to choose one of these avenues that you make it relevant and useful to your readers. A lot of bloggers make the mistake of assuming they are developing a product their readers need; listen to your readers first, and then create a digital product that will meet their needs. Use it as a Content Marketing Tool for Your Business It is also possible to sell physical products on your blog and to make money that way. Instead of thinking of it as making money from your blog, however, think of your blog as a content marketing tool that will drive visitors to your business website. The possibilities are practically endless when it comes to developing a business blog. You could sell hand-made products, books, manufactured products, and so much more. Or you might already have a business and decide to start a blog to convert loyal customers. Lets say, for example, that you refurbish and resell used smartphones out of your home. You could use a blog to attract visitors to your website where you list your current phones for sale. Your blog might cover topics about DIY refurbishing. On one level, it seems counterintuitive because you want people to buy your phones, but it also helps you build a brand and gain recognition. Social media guru Jay Baer explains the concept on Copyblogger: I was at a conference a few years ago, and this is where I first sort of started thinking about this concept, and their founder, Robert Johnson, was speaking\u2026 He said, \u201cWell our best customers are the people that think they can fix it themselves.\u201d But eventually you are going to get out of your depth either on that project on a project down the road, at which point who are you going to call? Are you going to call somebody randomly that you discovered on Google or are you going to call the guys who you just watched their logo in the corner of a 14-minute instructional video? This concept can also be applied to services in all types of industries. For instance, if you offered electronic repair services as opposed to physical products, you could still use the same blogging concept to increase brand awareness and convert more clients. Sell Memberships Another option to make money is to sell memberships to exclusive corners of your website. For instance, a career blog might charge $10 per month for users to gain access to their job board. A startup business blog might sell memberships to their forums where people can get personalized advice about their business. The key here is that your exclusive membership has to be more valuable than something your visitors can find for free somewhere else, so be sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re developing something of value and worth the price.

            "answer_text": "There are only 2 ways to make money with your blog: 1. Sell Advertisements Google Adsense is the easiest way to throw some ads on your site. But you need thousands of daily visitors to make at least $1 per day. So Adsense works mostly for blogs with high traffic...  ...or for blogs that get traffic from Google for very expensive keywords like \"payday loans\". If you want to learn more about that - go search in google for MFA sites (Made For Adsense) Banners - can bring you much more money than Adsense. Go to BuySellAds and check the price of a banner ad on different blogs. You can also approach advertisers directly and offer to place a banner on your blog. This way you won't have to pay a commission to anyone. Sponsored posts - business owners know that reviews make them a lot more sales than banner ads. That's why they will often pay bloggers for writing positive reviews on their blogs. Links - some people still sell links on their blogs. But this might get you banned. All in all.. there are many more options of selling different ads on your blog. I just described the most well known. 2. Sell Producs/Services Physical product - you can develop and sell some product. Luckily people from China are willing to produce anything you want (even the iPhones). Dropshipping - just google this term. Many people make a lot of money doing this. Information product - write a book, turn it into PDF and sell it on your blog. What can be easier than that? Affiliate product - if you don't want to mess with developing products of creating infoproducts, you can promote product of other people and get your comission per sale.  [that is my favourite way to make money from a blog] Just go to http://ClickBank.com pick a product that is relevant to the topic of your blog.  [shameless plug] If you have a marketing blog, you can become affiliate for two Wordpress plugins that I have created: http://www.tweetdis.com/&http://contentupgradespro.com/ There's a page called \"Affiliates\" on both sites. Good luck! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "For several months now, my wife and I spend many hours writing articles, creating videos, and sharing them on various social media outlets. We watch videos on YouTube by so-called gurus in our field to learn how they manage to get their content to the public. After sifting through numerous videos, the only feelings I get after watching them is frustration or disappointment. I am a person who works hard in being morally correct. In blogging, there are many different paths that one can take to be cheap inside. One of them is giving false advertising. As an example, we have clicked on certain headlines on a blog or video caption on YouTube only to be click baited into a completely different content subject. They are doing this to get clicks on their material to receive money. There are two sides to this situation. 1. Giving us false information is a bad thing. Posting a video telling us we can make a certain amount of money by blogging and then not giving any valuable content to make this happen is upsetting. 2. If people truly understood the money bloggers make by them clicking on an advertisement or purchasing products from the affiliate links, these content creators would not need to click bate. I blog to give thanks to the people and places that have given me happiness throughout my life. For that reason and believing it is wrong to write a misleading headline for you to click on, I will never stoop to the level of making money. When I write, it is to share with anyone interested my thoughts and knowledge about a particular subject. I have read so many wonderful fans write to me how grateful they are for my articles. It is such a great feeling to know that in some way these articles positively affect someone\u2019s life. There are ways to earn a living as a blogger. As an example, Google AdSense comes to mind. You see, I pay for my website to create content and make it easier for others to find these articles or recordings. I choose Google AdSense to share their ads on my website. Everytime anyone clicks on these banners, I receive some money. The amount I receive can range from $0.01 to about $2.00, with the potential of more than $10.00 per each click. When a person clicks on these ads, they are not purchasing anything. They are invited to a site that an advertiser paid for. I believe that only if a person finds something interesting in that ad should they click on it. The next way for someone to earn something is by way of Amazon Affiliate. We all purchase from Amazon. By purchasing a product from Amazon through the blogger, you are giving that blogger a commission for introducing you to the product. You will not be charged extra for doing this. You will not give any vital information to the blogger for purchasing something through their Amazon Affiliate link. What you will give is a chance for someone to get paid for creating something valueable. The kindness by a writer, who opened a reader\u2019s mind, would be met with kindness from the purchaser, who in turn made it possible for a blogger to get monetary compensation. Again, do not purchase anything you do not wish. When you do want to buy something on Amazon, try to do this through a blogger, because they will receive 4-10 percent from Amazon on commissions without any financial harm to you. Bloggers do not get paid for writing their articles unless they are a part of an organization. Most bloggers are not employed by anyone and make their money through the means I mentioned earlier. Some writers guess post on other blogger websites for free. They do this to garner new eyes for their blog. Some of us write to help someone and try to make a living from this. Others in this profession focus on making money through bait and switch methods. As we see on those videos, their views are tremendous. Having a lot of views on YouTube or a blog potentially brings a lot of profit. I believe it is morally unacceptable to falsely advertise a product or service, but it is not pleasant when you find out someone viewed a product on Amazon due to your article and bought that product not through your affiliate link. Remember, we all need to earn a living. Being able to write an article and help people is a wonderful thing. Ending up homeless due to the care for others is not. Where it is possible, help a blogger by commenting on their blog post, share it with others, clicking on ads that interest you, and buying Amazon products through affiliate links. They will be able to financially survive while helping others and morally be someone to look up to. Check out my other articles about Blogging. ",

            "answer_text": "Monetize it. Monetizing your blog. Affiliate marketing. ...Advertisements. ...Email marketing. ...Sell ebooks. ...Sell courses. ...Sell digital products. ...Sell coaching services. ...Secure sponsorships.1. Focus Blogs need focus. You need to have a specific industry, niche or topic that you write about repeatedly. Try not to go all over the map. You'll find that veering off on tangents will make you lose your core audience. People want to visit a blog -- and keep revisiting it -- because it fills a need or a void. That happens by staying focused and on-topic. 2. Quality People think that blogging is about pushing out an enormous amount of content. But it doesn't work if it's thin content. Your content needs to be quality content. It needs to be thorough, well-written and cite its sources. If a study is referenced, it needs to be linked to. Don't skimp on quality if you're serious about monetizing your blog. 3. Value Your blog needs to deliver value. What can you teach other people about? What are you an expert at? Take the time to deliver value. Create thorough tutorials and informative posts that interweave things like videos and other media to truly help people understand or figure something out. Value is a precursor to income in any industry, but especially in blogging. 4. Engagement How engaging is your content? Does your blog incite people to spend a lot of time reading articles, watching videos or messaging on a forum, for example? The more people engage with your content, the more likely they'll be to purchase something from you. Without engagement, there's very little chance of monetization. 5. Authority How much authority do you have? How well-known are you in your field? The more authority you have, the more likely you can monetize your blog quickly. For example, if you have a large social media following and you decide to launch a blog, you can drive traffic quickly. If you're an expert at something else or a best-selling author, for example, you already have authority, all you need to do is leverage it. Related: Why a Blog Gets You Further than an MBA Monetizing your blog. While there are arguably dozens of ways to monetize your blog, there really are eight core methods that will help you earn a healthy income from your efforts. 1. Affiliate marketing One of the most popular methods for monetizing a blog is to leverage affiliate marketing. This is especially useful when you're just starting out and you don't have your own products or services to sell. All you have to do is develop content that will ultimately be in harmony with whatever affiliate offers you plan to push out. For example, if you're running a fitness blog, you can easily sell affiliate health, weight loss or body building supplements. Since the content is already attracting people that are interested in fitness, selling these types of products helps you to create a near-automated stream of passive income. 2. Advertisements While most people might think that adding some pay-per-click (PPC) ads will be a great way to make lots of money with their blogs, unless you have massive amounts of traffic -- as in 10,000+ visitors per day or more -- the income will be marginal at best. The real income here doesn't start until you cross about 100,000 visitors per day. However, you could easily negotiate terms directly with advertisers by utilizing display ads as opposed to PPC ads. As long as the ads are within your specific niche or industry, you can likely negotiate an amount that would be much more competitive than income from standard PPC ads. 3. Email marketing One of the most powerful methods for making money from your blog is directly through email marketing. But to be successful, you need to build your list. Whether you promote blog updates or create a lead magnet, utilize one of the more popular email marketing platforms like ConvertKit, Aweber or InfusionSoft to implement the systems necessary to begin marketing via email. By building a strong bond and a connection with your readers, you can effectively generate a sizable amount of money through the course of marketing both your own products and services along with affiliate offers directly through email. You can expect to generate approximately $1 per subscriber per month. 4. Sell ebooks Ebooks offer a relatively quick pathway for making money from your blog. Develop an ebook that's aligned with the content of your blog. Non-fiction ebooks are relatively simple to create, and if you're teaching a skill that many people struggle with, it's likely that the ebook will produce a healthy profit. You can easily promote your ebook directly through your blog by creating attractive content that will draw people in, then enticing them with your ebook. You could also build a sales funnel, which is an online marketing term for an automated multi-step sales machine, and sell your ebook on autopilot. 5. Sell courses Selling digital online courses is another way you can profit from blogging. Develop intuitive and helpful courses that add a tremendous amount of value and the rest will be smooth sailing. By putting your heart and your soul into these courses, you can simply allow them to sell on autopilot for you, another great avenue for passive income. Courses work great when it comes to technical skills like web development, digital marketing, graphic design and so on. But they also work in formats like finances, stocks, currency investing and accounting. Find what you're really great at and do the due diligence before building your course. Thenm make something far better than the other courses out there in the marketplace. 6. Sell digital products Creating digital products is a great way to profit from your blog. You can effectively sell any type of digital information product on your blog as long as it's in harmony with your content. You can build a webinar to market your product and deliver them through a member's area or through other downloadable means. Digital products can be a combination of videos, downloadable guides, resources, PDFs, software components, SaaS and others. Do your best to create something that helps fill a need or a void. Don't second guess yourself, as you'd be surprised at just how much money you can make by selling digital products on your blog. Related: How to Produce Juicy Content That Catches Eyeballs 7. Sell coaching services While it does seem like coaching services are infiltrating every aspect of the market these days, selling coaching services through your blog can definitely be a lucrative prospect. Whether you set yourself up as a life coach, a career coach or a business development coach, you can earn a significant income through just a handful of clients. Decide on a number of packages, and do your best to ensure that you address any objections upfront. Customers tend to abandon the purchase process when it's too complicated, they have to leave the site, create an account or a number of other reasons according to one such study by Baymard Institute. 8. Secure sponsorships Sponsorships are a great way to make money from your blog, but you need the traffic if you're going to sell it for a significant amount of money. You can create sponsored posts as long as you label them as sponsored. The FTC cracks down on marketing products and services, including articles that are sponsored when in fact they're passed off as organic. You have to be careful with sponsorships. Be sure that you're upfront with your readership. Google also cares acutely about sponsored links and will penalize you if you're selling links along with penalizing the site that you're linking to. Simply put, it's not worth it, so be as transparent as possible. Builderall, The Online Business and Digital Marketing Platform | Builderall USA ",

            "answer_text": "Why Are So Many Confused About How To Monetize A Blog?  The answer is simple.  Many people don't see a blog for what it truly is... A lead generation tool.  No wonder so many people are confused about how you make money from blogging.  Your blog as well as your website is simply a tool:  For your prospects to become indoctrinated and further educated with you, your brand or your products and services.To collect leads.That's it.  You make money online the same way you make money off line - you sell a product or service.  Your blog/website is simply a tool to attract prospects, turn them into qualified leads and ultimately paying customers.  Ever heard that people make decisions based on emotion AND THEN back that emotional decision up with logic?  Know, Like And Trust People buy from others they know, like and trust - which is the main reason for your blog/website.  Get your audience to see you as an authority, someone who empathizes with their problem and finally has a solution for their problem.  Then BAM! You have a lead.  Yes a lead. Not a customer.  Unless you're an ecommerse store and your prospect is ready to buy.  In most cases your prospect was just looking for information - you know googling stuff.  So that is why capturing leads is the second part of the equation and the other reason you have a blog/website in the first place.  Once you capture that lead the real fun begins. Where The Money Is Made There are many ways one can \"make money from there blog\"  I use quotes because in reality saying I make money from my blog is like saying, I make money from my billboard ads or television commercials.  All those tools do is build awareness and educate - they don't actually make the company money.  And your blog is similar.  You want your target audience to be aware of you and your brand's products and services but the money isn't made there.  The money is made in your prospects email inboxes.   The research shows that it takes on average between 5-8 points of contact before your prospects become customers.  Whether your prospect is still researching their options or simply isn't ready to pull out their credit cards at the time, if your hope is that someone visits your blog and buys something before they leave, you're in for a rude awakening.  You need email to continue to build the relationship with your prospects and make them know, like and trust you enough to see your product and service as the logical solution to their problem.  How Do You Actially Make Money?  Simple.  You Sell stuff.  But what should you sell?  It depends on your market and your level of time and commitment to your audience and their problems.

            "answer_text": "There are several different ways you can earn money blogging. If you're planning to start your own blog, you can earn with an advertising program like Google Adsense and Amazon. But in order to earn via such a program, you will have to develop quality content for your blog and get good amount of traffic. Developing a blog to this level can take time. So, don't expect to earn right away.  It took me 7 months to earn my first $100 USD through Google Adsense. You can also blog for other sites. Many blogs and webties out there are looking for writers for their sites, if you have a creative mind and impressive writing skill, you can earn a decent amount of money by working for such a site as a full-time or a part-time writer. Freelancing is also a great way to earn blogging. You can offer your services as a freelance blogger and get hired via sites like Elance, where big brands and businesses seek help of bloggers and writers. Almost everyone on the internet has a blog these days, but blogging for money is quite difficult than it seems. First of all you need to have a passion that you like writing about and you need to be persistent. If you're looking to start earning right away after publishing your first blog post, you're not going to survive long. Start slow and give it time. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone now-a-days wants to earn money through different ways. Specifically women who are mother and home maker as well wants to invest their free time in a productive way to earn money. Just a brief idea how to start blogging - Research - Before starting blogging you should research in depth about it for example on which site to start (WordPress is recommended but you can find any site which you think suitable for you) , about which topic to write etc. Read more and more about this from different sites as people share their own experiences through which you can get varieties of ideas.Topic- Choose a topic which you are interested in rather than going for a trending topic because as you are a beginner you should write on a topic which you are really interested in as you must have a deep knowledge about the same later you can focus on different topics but write after having a detailed knowledge otherwise it may not get required audience.Note your thoughts- While doing research note the required information and thoughts(regarding website or process of writing or topics) which you get in a notepad or wherever you want and while creating your blog you can refer to this. Whenever you get an idea or thought just write it down later you can filter all these and get the best out of it.Writing skills- Read, read and read !!! Read a lot to get ideas about different contents and improve the skill of your writing. Reading makes a huge difference in your thoughts, thought process and also writing.Finally while you creating the blog make sure you give your own thoughts and content and present it in a different way as presentation is the most important thing which can get more views to your blog.

            "answer_text": "I'm sorry to say, but making $1,000/month blogging is highly unlikely unless it's run by a big web publisher. If you are operating a private blog with only one writer you will likely make somewhere between $25 to $50 per month blogging. If however you can find other bloggers to write with (create lots of good content on a daily basis), you may be able to get enough traffic to make $1,000/month. However, this will likely take several years and over 2,000 posts. I've listed some tips to blogging below. Best of luck.  Write about your passion or something you enjoy. If you choose a topic you're not fond of it will show.Choose a great platform. I use Blogger, but I would recommend Wordpress. It's all Wordpress does. They are experts.Use a clean light colored template. Light colored templates seem to perform the best. Dark text on white background is the easiest to read and see. Look at Google.Order a custom domain and pay for hosting with Wordpress. If you want to become successful you have to spend a little money.Have realistic expectations. Don't expect to become an overnight sensation. Successful blogging takes time...perhaps years.Post consistently. If you post once a week, post on the same day once a week. Two to three times per week is great if you can do it. Monday through Thursday are the best days to post.Open social media accounts especially Google+ and Twitter.Interact with the blogging community. This is perhaps the most important. Comment on other blogs...a lot. Retweet other bloggers posts. At least once a month promote other blogger's articles in your own post. Help promote other bloggers and other bloggers will help promote you. Other bloggers will also inspire you to keep going when you want to give up.Content, content, content. Create great content with images--no filler posts.",

            "answer_text": "All I have to say for most of the answers to questions like this is just, WOW. Yes, Wow. Why? Because there are so many people out there that will try to trick you with an answer. They\u2019ll tell you one thing and another thing just to extract money from you. Quite frankly, it\u2019s annoying. For the people out there that fall for much of the clickbait in answers to questions like this, all I have to say is SORRY. Yes, Sorry. Why? Because you\u2019ve been mislead and misinformed. You\u2019ve been guided by misfits and sleuths that are working tirelessly to make you believe one thing, when it\u2019s furthest from the truth. Can you make money by starting a blog? Yes. Will it be easy? Heck no. How long will it take? Longer than you think if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u2026 And unless you have an enormous following on social media or you\u2019ve already built up an email list of tens of thousands of subscribers, you can forget about any short-term goals for making any semblance of money from a blog. The truth? You need to put in long and seemingly endless hours before your work produces any amount of income. Let me explain. But first\u2026 You\u2019re likely thinking, who am I to say any of this? Well, I should know\u2026 I\u2019ve literally made millions of dollars by blogging. Yes, millions with an \u201cM\u201d. And I\u2019ve also answered this question in big media articles that I\u2019ve written: See my Forbes article about starting a blog hereSee my Entrepreneur Magazine article about starting a blog hereBut it wasn\u2019t the blogs itself that produced those millions of dollars in revenue\u2026 It was the ancillary digital products and courses that I created that did it. And they were sold through very carefully crafted sales funnels that employed tactics like scarcity and urgency while also building up a relationship with the consumer through a warming email sequence. You see, the world\u2019s most astute bloggers aren\u2019t just bloggers\u2026 They\u2019re internet marketers. No, not the slimy kind you might be thinking of. I\u2019m talking about people who understand things like trip wires and self-liquidating offers, SEO and SEM, able to drive both organic traffic and paid traffic, with an uncanny superpower to create mind-boggling conversion rates. At the end of the day, if you know how to build a converting offer, that\u2019s your ticket right there. Blogs and every other medium are simply conduits to getting people to your offers. And the bigger the blog, the more chance you\u2019ll have to drive people there. So, for the question \u201cHow can one make money starting a blog?\u201d I would provide the following action items list: Before you start your blog, plan your digital products (you can either sell your own or sell products as an affiliate, but if you really want to make money blogging, you should do the former over the latter).As you create content for your blog, build out your digital products. Your entire goal and intention should be to create content that supports whatever you\u2019re selling so that you can grab organic traffic that\u2019s relevant to your sales platform.Focus on building your list early on. That means you need a free offer ASAP. Do not wait until later to do this. You\u2019ve heard that the money is in the list and there are no truer words. This is called a lead magnet and you absolutely need one. This lead magnet should also support whatever product or service line you\u2019re offering.Create an email warming sequence that you can use to build a relationship with your subscriber and to add value to their lives. Your goal when you\u2019re starting and running a blog is to add as much value as possible. Even before a customer ever spends a dollar with you. That\u2019s how you build rapport and authority. Without it you have nothing.Build a proper sales funnel that you can drive traffic into and sell your digital products. Keep in mind that now one is going to buy from you on the first interaction unless you\u2019re an Amazon or an Apple, companies that have built trust over the years and decades. You don\u2019t have that same trust. So you need a sales funnel.Consider creating a self-liquidating offer in your sales funnel for a positive ROI on your ad spends. You see, blogging isn\u2019t just about organic SEO traffic, it\u2019s also about paid traffic. Your goal? Create content that supports your products. Then drive traffic to that content so that people will consume it and eventually buy whatever you\u2019re peddling. Remember, people will more likely view a blog post from an ad rather than click through to buy some product.Re-target using FB and Google pixels early on. This builds an audience so that you can re-market to them. Remember, frequency will increase the likelihood that people will buy from you. If you\u2019ve ever visited a website, then the ads followed you around everywhere after you left, that\u2019s how the smartest marketers in the world operate. They use pixels for re-targeting. Do this early on even if you don\u2019t intend to run ads for a while because it will establish an audience you can market to.",

There are two popular types of ads: CPC/PPC Ads: Cost per click (also called pay per click) ads are usually banners that you place in your content or sidebar. Each time a reader clicks on the ad, you are paid for that click.CPM Ads: CPM Ads, or \u201ccost per 1,000 impressions,\u201d are ads that pay you a fixed amount of money based on how many people view your ad.Perhaps the most popular network for placing these types of ads is Google AdSense. With this program, you do not need to be in direct contact with advertisers; you simply place the banner on your site, Google chooses ads relevant to your content, and your viewers click on the ads. There are countless similar programs available if you find that AdSense doesn\u2019t work for you, such as Chitika, Infolinks, and Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide. Sell Private Ads Working with advertising networks isn\u2019t your only option when it comes to selling ads. If you end up with enough traffic, advertisers may come directly to you and ask you to place their ad on your site. You can also contact advertisers yourself. The biggest difference from the above-mentioned option is that there is no middle man, which means you can set your own ad rates. Selling private ads can come in the form of banners, buttons, or links. You can even make money writing sponsored posts where you write about or give a review of an advertiser\u2019s product or service. Another option is to write an underwritten post or series, which is where you can write about any topic, but the advertiser pays for a \u201cBrought to you by\u201d mention in the content. The ways you make money with this can vary. For instance, you might charge a one-time fee for a link within a post. If you are hosting banner ads, you might charge your partner monthly. Bonus tip: To maximize your income, you can also choose to sell sponsorship space in your email newsletters, podcasts, and videos. Include Affiliate Links in Your Content Affiliate marketing is also another great tool for monetizing your blog. Here is how affiliate marketing works: An advertiser has a product she wants to sell. She agrees to give you a commission from each sale if the buyer is coming from your site.She gives you a unique link that tracks your affiliate code. That way, she knows when a buyer used your link to make a purchase.You include your affiliate link on your site. You can do this directly in the content or through banner ads. If a reader clicks on your unique link and buys the product you have recommended, you earn a percentage of what she purchased.You can utilize affiliate marketing through ad networks like Amazon Associates, or you can create private partnerships with advertisers and businesses with an affiliate program. Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesJust remember that if you are going to choose one of these avenues that you make it relevant and useful to your readers. A lot of bloggers make the mistake of assuming they are developing a product their readers need; listen to your readers first, and then create a digital product that will meet their needs. Use it as a Content Marketing Tool for Your Business It is also possible to sell physical products on your blog and to make money that way. Instead of thinking of it as making money from your blog, however, think of your blog as a content marketing tool that will drive visitors to your business website. The possibilities are practically endless when it comes to developing a business blog. You could sell hand-made products, books, manufactured products, and so much more. Or you might already have a business and decide to start a blog to convert loyal customers. Let's say, for example, that you refurbish and resell used smartphones out of your home. You could use a blog to attract visitors to your website where you list your current phones for sale. Your blog might cover topics about DIY refurbishing. On one level, it seems counterintuitive because you want people to buy your phones, but it also helps you build a brand and gain recognition. Social media guru Jay Baer explains the concept of Copyblogger: I was at a conference a few years ago, and this is where I first sort of started thinking about this concept, and their founder, Robert Johnson, was speaking\u2026 He said, \u201cWell our best customers are the people that think they can fix it themselves.\u201d But eventually, you are going to get out of your depth either on that project on a project down the road, at which point who are you going to call? Are you going to call somebody randomly that you discovered on Google or are you going to call the guys who you just watched their logo in the corner of a 14-minute instructional video? This concept can also be applied to services in all types of industries. For instance, if you offered electronic repair services as opposed to physical products, you could still use the same blogging concept to increase brand awareness and convert more clients. Sell Memberships Another option to make money is to sell memberships to exclusive corners of your website. For instance, a career blog might charge $10 per month for users to gain access to their job board. A startup business blog might sell memberships to their forums where people can get personalized advice about their business. The key here is that your exclusive membership has to be more valuable than something your visitors can find for free somewhere else, so be sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re developing something of value and worth the price.

            "answer_text": "You want to start a blog and the purpose is to make money from it. Whatever the reason be, you need to follow the procedure from step 1. You have not mentioned what kind of blog you want to make or what do you want to write about. Therefore let\u2019s start step-by-step. Step 1: Decide a niche for your blog This is so important because it will keep you on track every time you deviate. Try to keep your niche as focused as anything. How To Pick Perfect Niche For Your Blog Should I really do niche blogging? Or just general blogging? Step 2: Look for the audience Your audience need to be really interested in the work that you want to do. If not, at least you do whatever it needs to solve some problem of an audience that you like. Either ways it will work. Having a particular audience, will help you write relevant and focused content. Step 3: Write useful content[1] Writing just anything will never work for any blog professionally. Even I did this mistake in my initial days of blogging. But, then I realized and had to shift the whole focus to just one thing, and only that thing. See what issues are your audience dealing with. What can you do about it? Identify people you can involve in this direction to make your job to create content a little easier. How To Write Solid Content For Your Target audience Step 4: Market your blog well Nothing will work if you just keep doing your work and don\u2019t let other\u2019s see what you\u2019re doing. There must be so many others doing similar things. You need to put your foot forward, online and offline, and tell about your blog posts and other campaigns you run. For example, read this. Step 5: Monetize your blog To make money from your blog, there are a lot of ways. Some people think that when you write a blog post on your blog, you get money from some mysterious sources. No. There are ways you can do it. Read this: What are some of the ways to monetize your blogs? Footnotes[1] WitsAndWings \u2013 Helps Women Bloggers & Entrepreneurs Make Money By Blogging",

            "answer_text": "Ah, The Digital Hustle, The internet, The new frontier With the boost of the digital revolution, blogging has soon evolved into a mega money-making industry. It was originally created for the purpose of logging daily write ups like you would a diary (but in the context of being viewed by everyone online), and after the boost of social media and online marketing, bloggers started leveraging their online presence. Wrote a book about making money online Amazon.com: Digital Hustle: How to Make Real Money Online eBook: G Rummy: Kindle Store More on that later. For now let\u2019s cover making money with blogs. There are a lot of perks to blogging: sponsorship, invite to exclusive events, even to the point of gaining celebrity status, as we obviously see with most fashion bloggers today. Although it\u2019s seen as a full proof way of earning primary income that some bloggers started to quit their jobs to focus on blogging, it\u2019s also a steep climb to success. You can\u2019t simply start a blog and assume you\u2019ll gain readers and get paid. You can start free but may need to invest on a couple of things to upgrade your status. There\u2019s a ton of organization involved. There are 5 main steps to becoming a blogger: Build your Blog Before you become a blogger, obviously you need to set up your website first. Here are a few things to consider: Domain and Hosting Domain is like your house in the online world. It has its own address called a URL, for example, http://www.yourdomain.com. Hosting is the lot where your house is built. It\u2019s your own piece of virtual space, to say the least. You basically need both to exist in the online world. Now, getting a domain and a hosting plan could be pricey and some people do not want to invest as much before they can even start gaining traction online. Truth be told, domain, depending on demand and availability cost from $1.99 (on the first year) to a million dollars. Hosting plans, depending on the bandwidth you need, cost $3.99 to a few thousand dollars, both on a monthly plan. If you want to start free, you can opt to register on a blogging platform, like Blogger, Wordpress, and Tumblr. Signing up for these sites get you an account that works like a free bunk bed. Of course, the perks of having your own house and lot on the web will never compare to a free bunk bed. Signing up for free accounts will never work as great as having your own domain and hosting. Blogging Platform If you\u2019re not a talented coder, nor have the time to learn setting up websites from the ground up, you can sign up for a blogging platform instead, as mentioned earlier. Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, and many more offer bloggers with the necessary tools to build their website. As soon as you set up your account, you will still get that .Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. or .WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog tag with your free domain. If you don\u2019t want that and feel that a .com or .org sounds more professional, you can also try linking your domain and hosting to your blogging platform. Theme and Layout Your website\u2019s look and feel should be your primary concern when it comes to branding. Use a design that sits well with how you want your site to appeal to your audience. Make your own logo and blog banner. Post creative and engaging content As soon as your blog is set up, it\u2019s time to start uploading engaging content. By engaging content, I mean 3 things: Make sure it\u2019s relevant to your niche Make sure it\u2019s relevant to your audience Make sure it\u2019s generally interesting and informative All these are quite easy to spell out, but challenging to execute. There are bloggers who stick to their niche e.g. Beauty and Fashion, Technology, Travel, etc\u2026 And there are those who jump from one random niche to another. Try not to be the latter. If you want to keep your momentum and start earning as fast as possible, be consistent with your content. Market your blog as a brand Simply uploading your content will not make you an overnight blogging superstar. This is actually the tricky part--getting your blog out there. As stated earlier, money-making in blogging is a steep climb, and in this part, it just gets steeper. Here are a couple of things to note: SEO Search engine optimization is how your website can be searchable online. Would you like to simply be available online? Or would you prefer to be on the top spot in Google search results? From indexing your website to search engines like Google, Yahoo, AOL and much more, to learning how to monitor your statistics and the relevant factors that come into play, SEO is entirely a separate ebook to go through. It is a tough cookie to crack but once mastered, it will definitely boost your visibility online. Social media Social media is a great way to connect with people, and that\u2019s technically what you want to achieve. Being active in social media, gaining followers and building a community increases your chances of getting sponsorships. Advertisers have a certain radar for bloggers who are huge influencers, you know. Email marketing Another way to stay connected with your readers is through email marketing. From sending blog updates to promoting brands, email marketing is a great thing to manage for your blog. The number of your subscribers are also the testament to your online presence and will be a great highlight to your media kit. Leverage your online presence This is the part where you start reaping the harvest of your hard work. We all know that being able to make money off what you\u2019re passionate about is la dolce vita. It\u2019s like the world is rewarding you for sharing your talent and heart to your community. The one thing you need to have in order to attract advertisers is a page that lists all the services you offer as well as your rates. This is in order to: a) let them know that you\u2019re okay with promoting their brand; b) make them aware that your blog is only going to blog about businesses that relate to your particular niche, and c) to inform them of how much you value your blog. Now on to the ways to make money through blogging: Sponsored posts When a company discovers you online and sees how huge your network is, they may want to take the opportunity and ask you to promote their brand, in exchange for some cha-ching of course. They will send you an email detailing how they want to be promoted: the specific links and keywords you need to incorporate in the write up; the photos, posters or videos they want to include; as well as discount codes and coupons that can help them make sales through your blog. Sponsored posts is a one-time thing. If the company makes a ton of profit after you promoted their brand, they\u2019ll come back for more. This leads to\u2026 Blog Sponsorship When you\u2019re too valuable for the company as their marketing partner, they\u2019d want to seal the deal with you and offer you a contract indicating that as their brand ambassador, you\u2019ll be entitled to their exclusive perks (free stuff, event invite, etc...) under the premise that you should post every so often about them and that you are not allowed to promote other competing brands. This is a business relationship that you\u2019d want to take care of in order to sustain a sizeable profit for your blog. Product Review Bloggers are famous for sharing their opinions about everything online and as much as companies try to partner up for marketing purposes, sometimes they want to hit 2 birds with one stone and include market research too. They send in free products for the bloggers to try out and post a review on their blog. It may either be a hit or miss for those companies, but nevertheless a great way to get their brand out there and pick up on how they can improve their products. Ads and Affiliate Links Advertisement in the form of banners in your blog can help you earn money by simply uploading your sponsor\u2019s banner on your website. This banner will link back to their website. Some companies pay a flat rate for a specific amount of time and some also offer pay-per-click or pay-per-purchase schemes. Affiliate links are generated links that, depending on the platform you use, will earn you points or dollars every time a) a viewer clicks on their banner or link on your blog, b) a viewer clicks on the banner/link and makes a purchase on their website, and c) a viewer clicks on the banner/link and signs up for an account. This will be explained more in detail in Chapter 6. Selling your products Blogging can also be a gateway for reaching people online. If you\u2019re selling physical items, blogging is also a great way to reach out to your audience and sell your products by sharing information related to your products. For example, if you\u2019re selling properties, it would really help to blog about say, the different types of properties, things to check before buying a house or how a property increases or decreases value over time. Helping educate your readers through your blog will definitely increase their trust in the services or products you\u2019re offering. Making money through e-commerce will be further discussed in Chapter 12. You don\u2019t always have to sell physical products. Through your blog, you can also offer services like web design, virtual assistance, e-courses, and the list goes on. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, let\u2019s talk about being a blogger- In the world of web, there are two types of bloggers around. Passionate Blogger and Commercial Blogger. Passionate bloggers do blogging as one exclusive way to express themselves and their thoughts on what they are passionate about. If you know how to reach your posts to like minded readers, money will come as one of the many perks.  On the contrary, commercial bloggers are aimed at monetization of the blog with whatever content they can create to fetch some traffic. In this case, estimated income comes first rather that living the passion.  Based on your intention, you have to chose any of the two options. In both of the cases, there are tons of examples of succesful bloggers. What You Need to Know- To be a leading blogger on your niche, you need to have ample idea on these many things- Content Creation- For creating valuable posts, Images, Vidoes for readers.Web design- To make your blog look attractive visually. No need to be a code junky! Just a basic skill on WordPress is fine.Keyword Research-You gave to know what your potential visitors are searching for in Google. Finding those phrases which are searched many times, and putting them firmly on your content can be a good way to read your targettet visitors easily.On and Off Page SEO- This is one of the most crucal parts. Suppose you\u2019ve found out a low competitive keyword which has 5,000 searches per month. You\u2019ve published a well-researched nice content on that keyword and posted it on your blog. But how the heck you\u2019ll show this content to those 5,000 people?? The answer is SEO!Competition Analysis- Creating a good set of contents and ranking that in google isn\u2019t all of the game. No matter whatever niche you are blogging about, remember that there are hundreds of other bloggers doing the same and get on the podium. So, you have know how your competitors are doing and how you can do something better. Some of the facts you have to keep an eye on are- Competitor\u2019s Content Strategy, Backlinking Tactics, Offers and Promotions, Monetization methods, On-page Metrics etc. Some tools you can use to spy on your competitors are- Spyfu, Ahefs, SEMrush, Google Keywords Planner Tool etc.Now, Let\u2019s talk about methods of earning as a blogger- Ad-network Monetization- There are many of the ad-networks that pays decent amount of money as the ads provided by them gets clicks and conversions by traffic of your blog. Some popular ad-networks are- Adsense, RevenueHits etc.Affiliation- You may already know that if you can sell proucts/services/other virtual products manufacturerd by some other companies, you\u2019ll get a good share of profit you made them. Some popular ways of affiliation are- Amazon Affiliate Program, Clickbank Affiliation etc.Selling Your Own Products- At an advanced level of blogging, when you\u2019ve got a decent and trusted traffic who love you, you can sell any quality product you want. For example, if you are a gardenner and run a garden related blog, many of your readers will subsricbe your newsletters where you would be sending exclusive tips and post updates. If you can raise a trust value among your readers, they won\u2019t hesitate a few bucks to buy a eBook named A Complete Guide to Rooftop Gardening- Every Sphere Explained! This can be sold firmly by email marketing. These types of products can be eBooks, Tutorials, Physical Products etc.",

            "answer_text": "Everyone always says this (because it's true), but the best way for a blogger to make money is to not treat the site like a business. It's just too tough to make a living blogging - you have to have a passion for what you're writing about and hope that it pays off. Advertising is ok! It's your site, you can do what you want with it. Will it turn off readers? Maybe, but that's also up to you. If you choose an ad network that spews flashing auto-audio ads in every direction, or use text-link ads that trick people into clicking on them, people will become annoyed. If you sell the standard ad sizes, or small, custom (well integrated) sponsorships, why would your viewers care?  Transparency is one of the best ways to get your readers on your side. Make them feel involved in the decision. A quick post that says \"My server costs a lot of money, I'm thinking about advertising, will you hate me?\" will almost always get a positive, supportive reaction. Make it clear that you'll do your best to keep the ads from being obnoxious, or offer an ad-free subscription solution. Some ways to make revenue: - Display advertising. 728x90, 300x250, 160x600 are still the big three, and you can see the full list of standard sizes here: http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/508676/508767/displayguidelines. You can sell these ads directly, or outsource the sales to a 3rd party network.  - Affiliate marketing. Depending on the content of your site, it's subtle and easy to put an affiliate Amazon link to a certain book you like, inside your book review. You don't have to be pushy, but if they want to buy it, it's there! - Merchandise. If you have a very tight community, consider creating branded merchandise or shirts with inside jokes spawned from inside the community.  - If you have a newsletter, consider getting sponsors to pay for their ad to be included. There are a million different ways to go with this and as long as you're honest with your community, they'll support you. ",

So click away if that's what you're looking for :)  I only CONSISTENTLY started 'blogging' 2.5 months ago. Here on Quora actually. I do have this site and there are loads of blog posts there. It's a combination of careers advice and my own content. To be honest a lot of it is boring. I never 'blogged' consistently because I wasn't passionate and would start/stop for months at a time. However I'm changing that site and EVERYTHING now. Why?  Well I'm not passionate about making money  Where has this got me?  Writing on Quora about stuff I actually understand and care about. So I find it fun :) That's why you don't find blogs from me about 'how to make money/how to do seo/how to rank etc. That stuff DOESN'T INTEREST ME. (But it might interest you)  How is that working out for me?  In 2.5 months I've written around 700 answers. That's 9.3 answer per day. They average around 250 words. That's 2.3k words per day across the board. It takes me around 1-3 hours.  Where has that got me? [EXPAND THIS IMAGE]   I am closing in on 4 MILLION VIEWS in one month. Trust me I didn't expect that either.  I think I'll start making money from this soon enough. I have 120+ people optin for my landing pages daily. I'm new to blogging but here is what I can gather is the number one element:  WRITE STUFF THAT IS WORTH TALKING ABOUT.  Follow me if what I write about or my 'strategy' interests you. Don't do ANOTHER ME2 blog PLEASE. I tried that 10x times. It's boring and doesn't really work so well.  So here's the link to my optin page about going viral on Quora. Good luck :)   ",

Characterize a point or specialty, and plan all your substance around those things. This will enable you to laser-to center your written work, as well as to construct computerized items and administrations that compliment your substance. 2. Select a Platform While Wordpress is the most mainstream stage for blogging by a long shot, there are others out there that can be utilized, for example, a miniaturized scale blogging stage like Tumblr, Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free., and even Medium. 3. Pick a Domain Name Custom space names are critical in case you're not kidding about profiting from the blog you begin. In case you're at all worried about things like SEO, while choosing your space name, you should stick to the accompanying recommendations: -Utilize a known best level space (TLD, for example, .com http://or.net -Keep the space short, close to 15 characters or thereabouts -Make an effort not to buy an area name with hyphens, since they're all the more regularly connected with spammers -Abstain from utilizing self-facilitated sub domains to rank or sort posts 4. Locate a Good Web Hosting Company There are heaps of good facilitating organizations out there. In case you're beginning a Wordpress, self-facilitated blog, there is a close perpetual measure of alternatives. 5. Storing and Content-Delivery Networks (CDNS) Utilize a framework like W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache and turn on program storing to guarantee that you accelerate the conveyance of your website pages. At the outset, this won't appear as critical. 6.

            "answer_text": " Creating & writing a blog is actually very easy and making money from it is just as easy. The key thing is to keep is as simple and clean as possible in your management process of \u2018 producing \u2018 the blog and the offers around it. Most people post blogs and then stuff the holy crap out of them with ads from some service, which normally are an epic fail 99% of the time, with the 1% that actually turns a profit because they got lucky, matched relevancy and caught a hot crowd. Here\u2019s how it works on the advanced level, where you see blogs that you \u2018 know \u2018 are turning a killer profit but you can\u2019t see how they are doing it: Step 1. Work on building a blog that meets two primary points: -> You want to only take on a blog topic if you are \u2018 passionate \u2018 & \u2018 interested \u2018 in the topic. If you aren\u2019t interested in anything more on the subject than making money, you are going to be bored to death within the time you finish your first 3\u20135 posts. -> you want to only take on a blog topic if you \u2018 know \u2018 there is money in it and you can make a living doing what you \u2018 passionate \u2018 about. Do the research and check it out. Start by asking yourself the following questions to get started\u2026 $ Are there paid ad search results? $ Are there keywords with high level traffic flow through Google? $ Are there there lots of blogs in the site results from Google search? $ Are there products and services that can be made from problems into solutions for the industry following? $ Are you willing to do the work to match and pass those top listings enough to make a real go of it? Step 2. Build \u2018 value \u2018 focused content in your posts on areas of the topic first, then and only then, build offers around your topic and offer them on sidebars, ad spots, banners and images within your blog. The key here is to add value and content people can learn and use on your blog. People will follow that. If you do nothing but sales, you are a salesman with a sales page\u2026not a blogger with a blog. There is a difference. The way you make money is you bend over a dollar to pick up a dime with small time hard sales and ad promotion\u2026or\u2026you pick up the dollar and the dime along the way by posting proper ads on your blog to influence people to buy relevant products and services for your niche market and have a specific tab and page on your blog for your product and service line, which those ads take them to when clicked. Step 3. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS - be about the value you post first and the reader that reads it second and the customer that buys from your offers 3rd = total customer care. It is NEVER about you directly\u2026it is about the quality of knowledge and value you share and the offers you support and associate with that create an experience for your prospects and keep them coming back. That\u2019s how it works! Hope it helps you and you have great success with it! ",

            "answer_text": "Blogging is gaining a lot of popularity nowadays. Starting a blog isn't very hard but maintaining it and nurturing it is what really counts. There are millions of people who write blogs but most of them stay in the shadows and never get noticed by the world. Here are some things to keep in mind while starting your blog: 1. Select a Platform Selecting the right platform is a crucial part of blogging. Current WordPress in the most famous platform to be in. There are many other popular blogs such as Tumblr and Blogger .com 2. Caching and Content-Delivery Networks (CDNs)  Image Source: Hacker Noon CDN\u2019s are basically used to speed up your webpage and provide speedy content delivery. For a newbie blogger, this may seem irrelevant but note that as your blog grows and its traffic increases, CDN\u2019s will be your lifesaver. This is one step towards building a professional blog. 3. Install Google Analytics  Image Source: Grow .com Google Analytics is a great way to track the progress of your blog. This gives you an idea on how your blog is performing and the source of your traffic. Using this data, you can mould your marketing strategy to boost your performance. 4. Pay for your content Once your blog gets popular and you get a good amount of active readers and traffic, you can set aside some of your really good content and charge interested readers. This way you can provide a special kind of membership that entitles members to your exclusive content. ",

            "answer_text": "I know of a couple people making money blogging.  Let me share a couple of strategies.  It's definitely not a passive effort.  That word is a misnomer that tends to serve no one.  When was the last time you heard anyone making $5000 a month passively or doing little or doing nothing?  That's right.  Never.  The guys that I know who blog are still at it daily and try to introduce valuable insights for their readers.  The blogger is their man on the streets or in that niche that provides valuable and actionable insights. That's the ultimate goal.  One of these bloggers also has a subscription newsletter that he publishes 5 times a week, Monday through Friday.  So he is constantly working at providing actionable, relevant information. His attentions are peeled constantly on all things related to the 5 or 6 topics that he covers.  He does enjoy argument, in part, because he's good at it.   INCOME SOURCE #1:  AD REVENUEOnce you've got a blog up and running, create an Adsense account.  That's first.  This places ads on your site and tracks the advertising activity on your site.  You need to have ads on your site if you want to earn a microstream of income.  That's what it's about--having multiple microstreams of income.  Set a goal of $2,000 as you did or $5,000 just so that you have something to measure your efforts by.  Then execute the tasks chasing the nickels and quarters and $1.15 activities.  Remember, you're doing this as you're learning the kinds of topics your audience seeks when they come to your site.  Also, if you're going to create a subscription newsletter, be sure that your audience for that newseltter are people who have money. You do not want to sell RVs to people in the ghetto just struggling to survive.  INCOME SOURCE #2: TRAFFIC LEADS TO VIEWS & CLICKSSocial Media.  If you're using a WordPress website every post you write can be sent out automatically to several social media sites at once.  Twitter is a great place for this.  The reason why Twitter is a great place is because you can create an audience there simply by following key, top, or well-known folks in your niche.  If your niche is cooking, then follow as many chefs, foodie authors, TV personalities related to cooking or food as you can. When you write a post and distribute it through Twitter a small percentage of those you follow in Twitter will at least view your post if for no other reason than they are curious.  Jon Davis stated that \"you can't suck at writing and [you have to] have something of value people want to read.\"  This is absolutely true.  So you can see that a lot of skills are required.  And I doubt that you can outsource these initially.  If you do, it's going to cost you.  You can try Freelancer or Fivver to produce some articles for you.  But the search engines really prefer fresh and original material.  So does your audience. The more you write they better you will get at writing headlines.  In the world of 144 characters and social media, people act first on headlines.  If it's catchy, if it's interesting, if it's in the wheelhouse of contemporary news people will bite. The more you write and the more you post, the better you'll have an understand of how to write headlines that get looks.   If your site is a health food blog, you might want to recommend a particular vitamin or brand of vitamin.  When you do that be sure to get an embed link from Amazon for the product.  Or do the same thing with books or any merchandise found at Amazon, say, watches or electronics, whatever your niche is.  The embed link will show up as a product icon.  When someone reads your post, say, on the benefits of Magnesium and you have a link to Solgar's Magnesium in your post you are providing yourself with an opportunity to earn a few nickels there.  Remember, it's all about microstreams.  Multiple microstreams of income.  This is one of the reasons why it's hard to give an answer to your question of how to make $2,000 a month is because so much goes into making a little bit of money. But if you're relentless, if you're tenacious, and if you're maniacally focused, not only will you learn a lot but you'll also begin to earn something.   Twitter is good not only to gain followers, not only to publish links to your posts to get views and perhaps clicks on links and ads at your site, but it is also an excellent aggregate site that collects articles that you can review for readers at your site.  Learning how to mine value from the different social media tools does take time.   WRITE A POST IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION/THREAD @ OTHER SITESVisit other sites and comment on comments and/or articles at that site. Instead of writing a quick snarky comment to downdress someone you disagree with, write a post addressing the problem and offer solutions with an informed opinion and then paste a link to your post in their comments sections.  If that thread has 15 comments, then you'll attract a percentage of those 15 commenters.  But if a post at another site has  has 96 comments or 130 comments, then you'll attract a percentage of those.  What you do is answer or address the article in a post and then paste your post in those comments.  Think of how many people following that thread will open that link to your post.  Do this daily or weekly.  You're going to have to make lists. This requires systematic effort.  Success demands a systematic effort.  Lots of people have passion and drive and ambition.  Those who add a systematic approach to these tend to have greater success.  A bad plan is better than no plan; a bad plan can be revised.    TYPES OF POSTS TO WRITE1)  Write book reviews.2) Write critical reviews of comments made by people you follow on Twitter.3) Write article reviews.4) Write answer/solutions to a thread at another site.. . . and others. ATTEND SEMINARSAttend seminars related to your niche.  Create a press pass and say that you're a journalist at your company--give your website name.  Attend a seminar and report on it, particularly if the seminar will have well-known speakers from your niche.  Write up in summary what key points were made, trends, or innovations and put that post up on Twitter and you should see lots of traffic.  Lots more ways of generating microstreams.  The best to you.

            "answer_text": " These are 8 ways to make money with a blog. 1. PPC Advertising (Adsense) The easiest and fastest way to monetize a blog is through PPC advertising. PPC means \"Pay-per-click\", which means that they pay you every time a user clicks on one of your ads. What sets AdSense apart from other advertising systems is that you don't choose the ads that are shown... Google does it for you. 2. Advertising CPA - Cost-per-Action In this case, when a reader clicks on your ad, it is redirected to a landing page where you have to take an action, such as opening an account, filling out a survey or giving your personal information to receive more information. For each user who completes the action, you take a commission. 3. Private advertisers Just as magazines rent their pages to companies, you can rent areas of your blog to companies in the sector for a fixed monthly price. 4. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is nothing more than a specific type of CPA (Cost-per-Action) advertising in which the action is that the user has to buy something. So, you act as a commercial, promoting on your blog a product or service from another company, which pays you a commission each time you generate a sale. 5. Own products The most lucrative method to make money with your blog is to sell your own products since there are no intermediaries and consequently, the margins are wider. 6. Services Having a blog and writing frequently on a topic will help you position yourself as an expert in your niche. After a while, you can take advantage of that authority to offer your services. As over the months, you have shown that you know about your field and have established a relationship of trust with your readers, some of them may be interested in what you offer and become customers. The key to this model is the trust. 7. Promotion of your business If you already have a business, a blog can be a fantastic marketing tool. Your clients are interested in knowing who you are, how you work, and how things work on backstage. 8.

            "answer_text": "I have reviewed your site and I have the following suggestions. You have a nice-looking site, that is good.You have to proofread the text on your site. Spelling errors destroy credibility. I looked at your About Page and I found this: \u201call entrepreneur\u201d should be \u201call entrepreneurs\u201d. There are two more errors on that page and errors on other pages.Your site name is difficult to understand and this can puzzle people. \u201cGist\u201d doesn\u2019t really communicate to me and I have no clue what it means. It may throw people back as they enter.Your content is not very deep at all. Just read any of the posts on my blog, FunnelXpert and you will understand what I mean.Instead of just writing whatever you feel like writing about, find out what your target visitors are having trouble with. Then write a very detailed long-form post about that subject, targeting long-tail keywords. Recommend a solution. Here is an example of a post I wrote to solve the problem that people have trouble with building their sales funnels, because it\u2019s difficult to find themes and plugins designed for sales funnels. As you can see, it\u2019s a very detailed post, it shows solutions, and it ranks on the first page of Google for the keyword I selected. My blog is only 4 months old and here are the earnings: You need a \u201cStart Here\u201d page. The button on your home page should take the visitors there, not just to your blog. You need to channel your visitors with your site designDon\u2019t concentrate on money first, but concentrate on building your email list. \u201cGet free email updates\u201d is the absolute worst thing you can say to get sign-ups. Change that to your free guide.Create an awesome email sequence. Call it a free email course and give it a catchy name.Drive lots of traffic to your site.Sell products to your list. You may start with affiliate products, but the best is to create your own products eventually.You can use different tricks to drive more traffic and get more subscribers. I created a free Blog Earnings Troubleshooter that you can download for free and you can go through and find more points that prevent your blog from making money for you. No email address is required to download it, because I want it to spread like wildfire. I also contacted other bloggers that already have traffic and offered them to include links in the PDF to their high quality blog posts. Now they are all promoting it to their followers, which will result in traffic for all of us. This is called the Skyscraper technique. In order to get subscribers from the PDF download, I included a free giveaway in it - I call it the \u201cBelated Easter Egg Hunt\u201d. I am randomly giving away Thrive Themes and plugins. They need to read the PDF to find out how, because it is hidden inside. This ensures that it doesn\u2019t just collect dust on their hard drive. And my free email course is packed with extremely value. I have a 40 percent email open rate and 20 percent click-through rate from the emails. The industry standard for open rates is 17 percent and for click-through is around 1 percent. I am using Relationship Funnel to get such an engagement. That kind of funnel increases sales conversions, from email list subscribers to sales, from 1 percent to about 8\u201310 percent. As you can see, you need to know what your target audience wants, plan the flow of your business, constantly optimize it and be very inventive. ",

            "answer_text": "You want to make money, right? Of course you do. Everyone wants \u2013 and needs -to make money. So you started a blog since you\u2019ve heard it\u2019s an easy way to make cash, but you\u2019re not quite sure how to actually make money doing it. Or maybe you already have a blog and you\u2019re exploring ways to monetize it.  No matter which group you\u2019re in, making money with a blog \u2013 whether it\u2019s a hobby blog or a business blog \u2013is possible. It\u2019s not a get rich quick ordeal, but if you do it right, you could make enough to support your family and more. Let\u2019s dive in and see how you can make a profit with your blog.  One of the most common ways bloggers make money is through placing ads on their site. There are two popular types of ads: CPC/PPC Ads: Cost per click (also called pay per click) ads are usually banners that you place in your content or sidebar. Each time a reader clicks on the ad, you are paid for that click.CPM Ads: CPM Ads, or \u201ccost per 1,000 impressions,\u201d are ads that pay you a fixed amount of money based on how many people view your ad.Include Affiliate Links in Your ContentAffiliate marketing is also another great tool for monetizing your blog. Sell Digital ProductsIf you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesUse it as a Content Marketing Tool for Your Business It is also possible to sell physical products on your blog and to make money that way. Instead of thinking of it as making money from your blog, however, think of your blog as a content marketing tool that will drive visitors to your business website. ",

            "answer_text": "It is \u2013 with a good blog, you can definitely make a living with blogging and if you want to take things to the next step, you could make hundreds of thousands a year. That\u2019s not to say that just anyone can do it (at least not at that level), but it\u2019s a good way of making some side money; or, if you build a good enough blog and you have a good strategy/plan, you could potentially make enough to be able to leave your day job, and start your own business on the back of your blog. If you want to start making money from blogging, the first step is to consider the content of your blog \u2013 it needs to provide real value to your target audience and it needs to make them want to come back for more. You can\u2019t post a new blog post every once in a while; you need to be consistent, both in quality, and in quantity. Get yourself an editorial calendar, plan your content in advance, set goals and strategize the content you create so that it helps you achieve those goals and then keep to your schedule. Then, you also need to work on promoting your content. Build a following on social media, interact on other, similar blogs, guest blog on other websites, join blogging communities and so on. Before you can start making money, you\u2019ll first need to have the audience; you will need to promote and engage with users consistently, so as to build a steady stream of traffic to your blog. Then, you can think of the right ways for you of making money; you could host ads on your blogs and get paid per click, or you could promote and advertise affiliate products (such as from Amazon Associates, Amazon\u2019s affiliate program), which is one of the most popular ways of making money from blogging.  As you can see from this image, there are a plethora of ways of making money from blogging. The best way to make good money from blogging, in my opinion, is to create a business on the back of your blog; basically, use your blog as a stepping stone towards building an online business. You can sell products (e-books, premium content, merchandise and so on), or you could sell services (workshops, courses, coaching, training). Some even build blogs only to sell them later on, once they get to a certain level. You can read about all the different ways of making money in more detail in my guide to making money from blogging here. ",

            "answer_text": "As it seems from the question, you wish to own a blog to make a living from it. But here\u2019s a catch. You must have patience, dedication, hard work and smartness to learn new things. Same boring question for you- What are the things you are most passionate about? Traveling? Literature? Science? Computers? Gadgets? Tech? Weapons? Food? Beverages? Bodybuilding? Spirituality? Well, chances are you like one and all of these, but you are an expert in none. It is normal. Why not break it down into sub-topics? You love traveling or exploring a specific city or country? Go and write about everything that you find fascinating about it. You like one specific style of literature work, please explore that. You love science, it could be physics of everyday life, or how the recent researches can be breathtaking, or a trending bacteria which is awesome enough to be a celeb on the internet, research and write everything about it interestingly. You like computers? Maybe you can help people how to buy the best computer and accessories. You may be good in programming, web design or even things like photo video editing, explore it, zoom it, there is a lot about Computers, Gadgets, and Tech, write about cloud technologies, write about robotics, write about AI. Same goes for almost every subject you can think of in the World. There are a lot of sub-topics within everything you can think about. Don\u2019t try to cover everything. Instead, cover just one topic or two topics or niches and nail it. Be the Wikipedia of it. You will get genuine subscribers, genuine shares, genuine income from not just AdSense but affiliates and direct sponsors. Do one thing today. Become an observer. See how other blogs are doing. How they are earning. What the heck is this SEO, or keywords and things like CPC, this and that, how do they promote their blog properties, how do they convert a normal visitor into a subscriber, what is that something which makes them awesome? There is a lot to learn throughout. Let\u2019s start blogging and create interesting content and take calculated risks for everything that other blogs do well. It comes from practice, from dedication and from never stopping in the midway. Hope to make money right from the beginning months of your blogging, but please feel free expect it coming quite lately, say after a year or more. The fact is, it takes time. Till then, you can make your blog awesome enough. Remember, you can only sell something when either it is trending or it is useful. A blog can only be useful when it has a lot of helpful and useful content. Keep stuffing your blog with that. The money will surely come. First, a necessary step is to plan and begin. And Second is to never stop. The third is to keep looking for better opportunities and resources for your blog\u2019s overall growth. :) ",

The best part is you can use multiple monetization ideas at the same time to create a truly diversified income stream from your blog. Enough bragging lets dive in, 1) Become a Professional Freelance Blogger We all know there are many bloggers out there in the internet world, some have taken blogging as their full-time carrier and some do it part-time. But the end result is many are making money from a blog. For example, Linda Formichelli makes $250 per hour, as a professional freelance writer. Over 50% of Freelancers have improved their lifestyle over the last year. If you are already a blogger, then you have the skill set to become a professional freelance blogger. The fact of the matter is brands are desperately looking for professional freelance bloggers. Don\u2019t worry, let me tell you how to become a freelance blogger and make extra money from home. First off, you need to be on top of content marketing to be a professional blogger. I can\u2019t stress enough creating quality content can get your readers attention and a lot of engagement. You also need to be consistent in publishing blogs. As a freelance blogger, you need to understand your audience very well and create content that will spur them into action. It\u2019s hard to find professional freelance bloggers who have WordPress, SEO, social media, and persuasive skills. So if you can add these skills to your writing then surely you will become a highly professional blogger. Keep in mind, nothing happens overnight. You have to put in a lot of effort and be consistent in creating contents. Down the line, all your efforts will be paid off. One bonus tip, initially you need to market your freelance blogging services through guest blogging on high-traffic blogs, social media marketing and even try out PPC (pay per click) in Facebook. 2) Write Kindle Ebooks This is one of the best ways to make money online with less investment. There are tons of people making money writing short ebooks in Amazon Kindle store. The cool thing about Amazon is they are a trusted online shopping site visited by millions of people who are ready to buy. So you don\u2019t have to put in a lot of effort to convince people to buy your Kindle ebook. The truth is you need to work extra hard to earn your bread and butter out of it. Remember the better content you produce the more money you will make. You need to publish ebooks consistently because these ebooks are priced pretty cheap ranging from $0.99 to $4.99. Usually, ebooks are fast selling products. If it becomes a best seller you will at least sell 100 books a day. Now you can estimate the income. If you have little money to invest $50-$100 you can outsource your ebook from from Fiverr. This is an amazing place to get your work done for a cheap price. (click here to continue reading\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "Great question right! I have a simple answer, and it\u2019s not a traditional one. There were many myths out there of what you need to do to get ahead in the blogging hemisphere: Build a listGrow a followingWrite a lot of content\u2026and so forth. I bought into many of them. But they weren\u2019t working for me. I hit a bottleneck. I wasn\u2019t getting ahead. Much like you, I was stuck, trying to figure out how I could really start to earn money with my blog. Then one day, it all clicked. I discovered how to utilize content in the right way to get ahead. Here\u2019s what I learned\u2026 Creating content first and then figuring out how to monetize it later is a bad idea and doesn\u2019t work for most people. A better strategy is solving a problem that customers are willing to pay for first and then creating content around that problem. Before moving towards the answer of the main question, I would suggest you friends to keep in mind the following points- Making money through blogging is not an easy taskThere were many sleepless nights behind that overnight successMoney is in the list. The more loyal subscribers you have, the more you money you can earn from your blogA lot of the \u2018how\u2019 is from some kind of advertising or using AdSense or that kind of thing. Somebody\u2019s got to click the wretch ad for something to happen. Then there\u2019s affiliate marketing, which to me is like a joint venture with somebody. Then there\u2019s the old standby of the blog being a front end to a real business selling products \u2014 at least this one isn\u2019t selling smoke and pitching fumes. Let\u2019s discuss these topics one by one\u2026 Display/Banner Ads: This is one of the most common methods to earn money through blog. There are people who are earning their living out of this method alone. But this is not a very lucrative option if you\u2019re just starting out and your blog doesn\u2019t receive much traffic. Many of the AdSense ads appearing beside Google search results, someone\u2019s blog, and even on your own blog are likely to be products with affiliate programs attached. It is sometimes worth checking out the ads (don\u2019t click the ads on your own blogs, you will be penalized) to find out the potential affiliate partners. Very often, you will be surprised to find some great affiliate programs that you might not know. Affiliate Marketing: This is by far the second best option to earn money from your blog. Affiliate marketing is a strategy whereby the marketer partners with a company to sell their products. When a product is recommended or mentioned and this translates into a sale, the marketer makes a commission. Ever consider making a purchase? Before making this purchase, you likely researched some online reviews right? Well, that\u2019s what I do. When I come across a review, I will see the good the bad and the ugly about the product I am interested in purchasing. If I like what I am reading, all I need to do, is click the link in the review and make my purchase. From that purchase, the site owner earned a commission. (I am not saying this is 100% across the board. Not every company offers affiliate links). If your blog falls into review or niche category, then it\u2019s even better for you earn money through affiliate marketing. One of the most popular affiliate marketing program is Amazon Associates Program, Shopify Affiliate Program and Bluehost Affiliate Program.Before you start adding affiliate links to your blogs, make sure the products you promote align with your blog niche. Sell your own products:Next thing you can do is to promote your own products like e-books, courses and other products to your loyal subscribers through email marketing tool and also across social media platforms. This is by far the best way to earn money from your blog provided you have decent subscriber base and social media following. Use subscription method if you\u2019re selling any product to your audience instead of one time payment. That way you retain your customers as well earn money. Keep in mind that unless you provide value to your customers, they won\u2019t invest in you. While there are other ways to earn money from your blog but the above mentioned ways are by far the ways to make money through your blog. It\u2019s incredibly hard to make money from blogging. Don\u2019t let the \u2018successful\u2019 blogs fool you. Don\u2019t let the blogging gurus convince you otherwise. To make even a moderate amount of money, it will take you heroic amounts of time and effort to make enough as sideline money, never mind main money as a livelihood. Those with extremely good topic focus \u2014 and usually a nose for trends \u2014 will have a better chance. In short, you need talent to make money from blogging. Stay blessed and happy learning !!

            "answer_text": "No., May be Yes, Only creating some kind of blog will never earn you! You have to increase your website reputation and traffics. Then monitize it to earn. Reputation ? How could we earn it. By providing trust to your viewers. First design your blog , it must look like a decent website instead of looking as normal blogspot. Because don't like blogspot even if you have a separate domain. Then provide some use content, if your blog is related to news niche then lost lattest news. If you don't have time to write real article then search your niche in Google and go to 10 + page and copy some article from that pages and re edit it and post . Post article regularly, peoe will always like fresh content. Fresh article with attracting image will help you to increase your viewers activity and reduce your bounce rate. How you get traffic : Lots of way to get paid traffic, fiverr allow you to get 15k traffic for 10 $ . But it won't help you increase lead. If you plan to sell your site then you will try paid traffic for 6 months and sell it . But if you try to monitize it then you have to generate organic traffic . If you have more money then you will choose AdWords. Google AdWords will help you rank your website in first page , but you need to spend more to win the bid. Or you will try social share, share your all articles in Facebook, twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon,Google plus , quora, reddict and many more. Guest post is best way to get targeted traffics. But no one will allow you to post your add in their website. They will charge few bugs to guest post. If you have 20+ DA site , then you will Influence it to exchange guest post. Atleast post more than 200 high Da website to get decent traffics. How to Monetisation? Adsense is alternative meaning for monetisation, everyone will advice you to monitize your website with adsense. But from my experience it's better to avoid adsense, Adsense have more strict policies and rules, more chance to get ban before you reach your threshold amount. All In One News is my 5 year old blog- I never earn single penny from adsense by using this blog. Adsense will disable your account for more stupid reasons . It's shows some partiality between regions,Is Adsense Worth It - Fancsy - Should I Use Adsense ? Adsesne altrantive : Am not suggesting any alternative Cpm or Cps network then adsense. It better try some other method instead of ad networks. Flip your website in flippa , hextr, sedo, bidoGuest post - allow your visitors to post their own article in your blog and charge them.Membership- Convert your audience to paid membership owners.Affiliate market- sell some niche oriented product to your viewers and earn decent commission.Sell email list- sell your viewers info details .Sell backlinks- instead of posting full articles , simply add links in your existing post and charge few bugs.Sell ebooks- similar to affiliate market, sell kindle ebooks to your viewers.I thought my article will really helps you, up vote it if you like it. I hope you like my answer. Please upvote it and share with your friends. ",

People who love writing a lot and are good at it, will get paid for it.There are a lot of styles of blogging and people blog about almost everything, so there is almost everything we can read about on someone\u2019s blog. We usually don\u2019t trust advertisements but we trust what people actually say something about that product. This thing is what advertisers, sponsors and marketing managers use to keep a trend of their product in the market (or to create a buzz about their product). Think of it like this:A product \u201cabc\u201d is going to be launched, the company then pays bloggers and article writers to write content about their product so as to create a BUZZ about the product even before its release (You might have heard the word \u201cLeaked images or Leaked news\u201d about some product\u2026).ORif a product has been launched, and to create a craze about the product, people pay bloggers to write about it, so that more and more people come to know about it. Usually people pay bloggers to write about something. So, basically People who are good at convincing people can write such things and advertise about products and earn money(Not all bloggers do that. Some have their own opinion about the product, although they are somehow creating a talk about the product). Other thing is that they can earn from advertising, like showing ads on their blog so they get an amount of money when someone visits their blog. You\u2019re earning via blogging depends upon how much visitors your blog gets, usually on avg. daily/monthly basis or how much view your newest blog gets within a couple of hours. For this you must have a knowledge about SEO and SMO to get more views. Hope this helped. :D ",

            "answer_text": "EIGHT WAYS TO MAKE MONEY WITH BLOGGING, NUMBER 8 WILL SHOCK YOU Blogging is an Ocean and there are thousands of fishes to catch in but most of the people aren\u2019t aware of it. Making money with Blogging is quite easy but how much money you make with Blogging is more important. Here we are with eight different ways of making money with Blogging. Before we discuss how to make money with Blogging you need to know what is Blogging? What is Blogging? Blogging is simply writing but it's not that simple too. It includes hell lot of things but the main thing is your content and the CONTENT IS THE KING. So all you have to focus is on writing and everything works eventually. In minimum words, Blogging is creating content in a textual format online and making money with it. So, in order to make money with Blogging, you have to follow a few steps like Creating a website OnlineStart Writing for your Site or hire someone to write for youOptimize your Website for Search EnginesMake Money with itHow to Make money with Blogging Google AdsenseThis is the most popular way of making money online with Blogging and it works pretty fine. Google Adsense is a network of advertisements that display ads on your website and shares revenue with you. Yes, you are not fully paid for the Ads shown on your site, Google takes a part of it. But it is the simplest way and most common among Bloggers. All you have to do is Sign Up for the Adsense and place Ads on your site once you get approval. This will generate huge money if you have enough traffic on your site. Affiliate MarketingAffiliate Marketing is the most profitable way of making money online. It is not with Blogging only but in general a great way. What happens here is you become a salesperson for a brand and you are paid a commission for that. But you have to create sales first. So with Blogging you can place affiliate links of some products relevant to your site and your audience and if there is a sale you will earn a commission. You can Sign up for Amazon Affiliates one of the most trusted platform or any other of your choice and start making money. Sponsored ContentThis is another way that can generate huge money for the work that you are already doing. Yes, you heard it right all you have to do is Blogging and you will be paid extra for it. Sponsored Content is the content you create for a brand that will pay you for doing this. But to get Brand Sponsorships, you need to build an audience base. If you have enough traffic on your site say monthly visits of 20,000 brands will automatically approach you and pay you to write for them on your site. This is just a bonus way to make money because you have the rest of your ideas already working. Selling Ad SpaceIf you are wondering, you already placed Google Adsense Ads on your site then this one is just an additional source of earning for you. Once your blog is popular enough to have huge traffic, brands directly approach you to place their image/banner ads on your site. You can charge any amount you want for that Ad space. To understand this let us consider an example of popular e-commerce site Amazon. If you visit Amazon Site or app you will see a lot of Banner Ads about upcoming and recent smartphones. This is how they generate huge money. Guest PostingGuest Posting is posting content on other websites. But take in this way that others want to post on your site. You can charge any amount you want to let others post on your website. But why would anyone pay you and even write for you? Basically what they would do is just redirect traffic from your site to their\u2019s by creating a Do-Follow Backlink. This will enhance their Domain Authority and improve their website in Seach Results. There are a lot of Bloggers charging huge money for allowing others to guest post and even some people do it for free. BacklinkingGuest Posting is a great way to create Do-Follow backlinks but some people just directly charge for backlinks only. It's like YOU PAY ME AND I WILL LINK YOU. You can charge huge amounts for giving backlinks from your site to others. But here you need to be very cautious as you can earn big money but if you are linking to a malicious site, this will ruin your site\u2019s image. So be careful while linking others, Check their website fully first. Make sure that you are not linking to an adult website.

            "answer_text": "Yes, some people do make money that way, but it requires a bit of work and patience. Blogs that generate income are blogs about specific topics that interest people, not blogs about your personal life. For example, a blog about camping might be a good idea. It is a hobby a lot of people are interested in. The money can be earned in a couple ways. One is by getting sponsors or selling banner ads on your site. Another way is by earning a commission from Amazon. In this case, it works like this: in your blog entries, you might in passing talk about a number of products of interest to your audience. You hyperlink them to their listing page on Amazon. If somebody goes from your website to Amazon and makes the purchase, then you get a small commission. This approach is not worth it for relatively inexpensive items like books. If the item costs say $300 and up, then it becomes worthwhile. The hard work part of blogging for money is writing you blog entries. They should be quality content, probably 2000 words or more. They should also include some good images. Moreover, you will need 25\u201330 entries for your site to generate some attention and be ready for earning some money. It will probably take 6 months to a year for your site to get any traction. Just be patient and wait it out. I am not an expert on this. For more specifics there are a number of YouTube channels on the topic. A good place to start is School of Income. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The website StudAds like Google Adsense is the best way to get paid from your blog. Why it is better than Google Adsense? Many people have put up this question . I answered to this question very simply. Google Adsense will never approve any new blog until you have 100 visitors perday and your blog should have 6 month old. Its minimum payout is $100. It is difficult for beginners to get paid. So, How to resolve this problem? I have a better option to overcome this issue. StudAds on the other hand is the best for beginers . It approves your affiliate account within 24 hours weather it is old or new. I am getting maximum 80% affiliate commission which is highest in industry . Also, the another plus point is its minimum payout is only $10. So, you can earn money soon. What is my Google Adsense Account is suspended ? Don\u2019t worry. You can restart your earnings from here. And this is easier to handle than Google Adsense. How can I get Started ?

            "answer_text": " Don\u2019t launch until your blog is correctly set up No matter how tempting it may be, you don\u2019t want to launch your blog too early. Make sure you have covered the basics, such as having  an about and contact pages, as well as a decent looking design. Your design doesn\u2019t have to be unique\u2014you can just use a free WordPress theme. As well, make sure you are using Feedburner to track your RSS feed and Google Analaytics to track your visitors. Pick a topic and stick with it Even though it\u2019s your blog and you can write on whatever you want, you have to pick a topic and stick with it. Your blog will be much more popular if you stick with one topic. Be consistent If you have a lot to say and a ton of time, blog daily. If you don\u2019t have much time on your hands or much to say, blog once a week. Once you figure out how often you are going to blog, stick with it. The quickest way to lose your audience is inconsistency. If you aren\u2019t sure how often you can blog, start off by blogging once a month. If you happen to have more time, you can step it up and blog more often. Just don\u2019t reduce the number of times you are blogging. Now that your blog is a few days old, you should start seeing some comments. Although  standard practice only dictates that you read every comment on your blog, you should also make an effort to respond to each and every commentator. If you don\u2019t, some of your commentators may feel like you are ignoring them. Responding to every commentator will help you build a loyal following, which will help build up your traffic in the long run. Stop regurgitating content Don\u2019t just blog about the news or about something you saw on another blog. If you are going to write about the same topics as everyone else, make sure you throw in your two cents. People are reading your blog because they want to hear from you\u2026right? It\u2019s best to give them what they want by providing your opinion. Ideally, you should only be blogging when you have something new and exciting to say. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks Most bloggers are afraid of saying what they really think, especially when it is something negative. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks, even if most other bloggers don\u2019t take them. If you really feel a specific way about something, then write about it, no matter how negative or positive it may be . Controversy is one of the quickest ways to build a large following because it will cause other bloggers to link to you. Just don\u2019t abuse this  power by writing controversial posts for no reason. If you do, it could end up backfiring. Differentiate yourself Like anything else, you will have competitors. So if you want people to read your blog instead of your competition\u2019s, you\u2019ll have to do something unique. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything crazy, just something different. For example, if you blog about entrepreneurship \u2014 so do  thousands of other bloggers. The wayyou would try to differentiate yourself is by writing detailed content that helps entrepreneurs take action. Entrepreneurs can get information from anywhere, but it is hard for them to find resources that tell them what to do. Survey your readers Now that you have built up a small audience, it is time for you to survey them. The best way to improve your blog is to get feedback from your readers. Network with bloggers The easiest way you can grow your blog traffic is to get other bloggers to link to you. But if you just hit up 100 random bloggers, you\u2019ll be lucky if you can get a few to write about your blog. On the other hand, if you start chatting with bloggers through instant messaging and email, you\u2019ll start building relationships with them. And when you need them to plug you on their blogs, your chances are going to be much higher. Participate in the conversation In addition to responding to the comments on your blog, you should comment on your competition\u2019s blogs. This is a great way to get some of their visitors to come over to your website. Are you familiar with Mashable? If you aren\u2019t, it is one of the top 100 most popular blogs on the web. One factor that led to Mashable\u2019s success is that when they first launched, they commented on their competition\u2019s blog. I know this can be time consuming, but you don\u2019t have to do it with all of your competitors, just the most popular. Optimize your blog for search engines According to Alexa, Google is the most popular site on the web. So why not optimize your website for it and other search engines? SEO doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. If you have a WordPress or Movable Type blog, this article will walk you through the steps you need to take to be search engine friendly. If you don\u2019t have a WordPress or Movable Type blog, you can still optimize it. You just may have to put in more time. Come up with a monetization plan You shouldn\u2019t try to monetize your blog within the first few months of blogging because it can be a big turn-off for your readers. But you still need to know how you are going to make money from your blog. Come up with a plan of monetization strategies you want to test over the next few months. And don\u2019t just rely on the standard methods such as slapping up Google AdSense. Get creative; try out some affiliate ads and other approaches that are more integrated with your blog such as a subscription program. If you don\u2019t want to make money from your blog, that\u2019s fine, but in many cases, the popularity of your blog will increase as you make more money \u2014 just look at John Chow! Have someone tweet about your blog (not you or your mom) Tweeting about your blog posts isn\u2019t enough. You need other people to tweet about your blog. Now that you have been leveraging Twitter for a while, here are a few ways you can get others to tweet about you blog: Ask your followers to retweet your message (assuming you just tweeted about your blog). Email friends and colleagues who use Twitter, and ask them to tweet about your blog. Join a social media ring. If you join a group filled with social media users, you can ask each other for tweets. Keep on feeding the fire Through services like Google Blog Search and Technorati, you will be able to find out when someone mentions you on their blog. Keeping track of this on a daily basis will allow you to thank every blogger that mentions you on their blog. By showing your appreciation, you will build up a larger fan base. Plus, those bloggers will be more likely to blog about you again because you said \u201cthanks\u201d to them. Don\u2019t expect the world Most importantly, don\u2019t expect your blog to be popular. It can take months, if not years, before your blog becomes really popular. You just have to be persistent with it. If you stop, you\u2019ll lose the traction you built over the last month.         ",

            "answer_text": "Relevancy is a key concept in how to make money blogging for beginners. It is recommended that you create a niche for your blog and keep the target audience in mind. Many times a blog is created with no idea or concept in mind and it turns into another ghost website on the web that has very little purpose. It is always important to concentrate your efforts on the end product and message you want your blog to send to its readers. A good blog can make you money in a variety of ways. There is no \"correct\" way to make money from a blog. Some of the top bloggers in the world all use different methods for making money from their blogs. Some of the most common methods, however, include the following: 1. Embed relevant affiliate links or text ads in text and potentially earn money every time a curious reader clicks. 2. Create sponsored posts and potentially get paid for writing a review of a product or service relevant to their blog's niche and audience. 3. Use Google AdSense or another Internet marketing tool to enable banners or other ads on their blog and potentially generate income on a pay-per-click basis. These are the top income generation methods being used by bloggers today and if you are interested in creating your own blog you should consider monetizing it in this way. Remember, always keep the purpose of your blog front-of-mind and the most appropriate way to monetize it will be easy to determine. There are several ways to make money from a blog. The important factor to remember is to use links, posts, banners, and other advertising that is relevant to the blog's audience. Embedding affiliate links in the text or creating sponsored posts of a certain product represent some of the most basic ways to monetize a beginner's blog. Google AdSense and other pay-per-click ventures may also help a beginning blogger net revenue. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few routes here to earn money from blogging.1) You write for someone else's blog and get paid for it2) You create your own blog and earn money from advertising, selling your own products and services or charging a subscription. If you get really good at something there are rare instances where a company has bought a blog to reach a marketplace - but I wouldn't bank on that. so... if I were you I'd start with number one because the other stages do require a lot of upfront investment of time and a bit of money. Although in the long run it could pay more (if it's highly targeted at a niche) nothing is guaranteed.  In other words, I guess you're wanting to be paid to write blog articles. If you have particular interests and sites you want to write for you should approach them directly. Have some examples of your work. Go to the contact us page on their website and pitch some ideas to them. If you have any experiences or extra credibility you can add (e.g. you already written for similar sites) you'll be more likely to get a response. Otherwise if you're not too fussed about the topic,  go on Odesk and create a profile as a blog content writer and start applying for jobs. To start with it might be difficult and may not pay very well. However as you start to build a profile on the site, get more clients and positive reviews you \"climb up the food chain\" so to speak. Set a minimum rate per article you're willing to accept to start with and don't go below that. There are lots of content farms on odesk who will pay $2 per article and don't expect anything of any quality. If you're a native english speaker with good ideas you shouldnt be working for anything less than $15 hour That should get your writing career of to a start and earning you an income. Then you can start working on your own projects and blog. Pick a niche you're interested in e.g. garden gnomes or something. Then write about them. You should learn about SEO and use a tool like Market Samauri to find relevant keywords that you should include in your articles. You'll also want to spend time promoting it on social media, writing comments on similar blog sites that link bank to your site, and trying to syndicate your articles with other blogs so you pick up an audience.  Phew! I know that's a lot. But now you have to monetize it. Once you have traffic you can start to place ads on with something like Google Adwords. You could sell ads via BuySellAds.com. You could set up your own ecommerce store selling Garden gnomes with something like Shopify. Or you could create your own courses on gnome decoration or something. There's a lot of steps there and a lot of specialised knowledge involved if you want to earn money from blogging for yourself. So that's why it's probably easier to start with writing for someone else. But once you get good and if you have a sharp business brain - you should create your own things. One final thing - I'm a copywriter for a living. I write blog articles, landing pages, sales letters, email campaigns,  web copy. You name it - I can give it some pizazz that sells. Check out my website alexclifford.me or email me alexclifford93@gmail.com if I can help you with anything else. ",

(Unless you count sponsor posts, but I will talk about that later) A blog is actually just a platform to create money making activities. So the ways to make money with blogging is many and very varied. It all depends on how creative you can get. Here are the most common ones: AdsenseThis is the easiest and most common way to start making money on a blog. How much you make with adsense will depend on which ad network you join, your traffic and the demographics of your traffic to your blog.Sponsor postsThis will be the second easiest way to start making money on your blog. You find businesses and brands, or they find you to write about them for a price. There are many payment structures, it can be fixed or based on KPIs pre-agreed between you and the business.Affiliate marketingThis is another common way to make money on your blog. You find products that you want to promote and use your blog to promote the product for a commission on every successful conversion.Fixed banner adsNot so popular anymore, but you can still do it. You sell ad space on your blog, in return the person who rents out your ad space can put up a banner ad on your site.Selling products and softwareA lot of bloggers have their own products or services they sell that\u2019s related to the topics they talk about.Selling Premium contentSome blogs will have members only area where you have to subscribe and pay to gain access.There\u2019s other ways you can make money from a blog, but these are the most common.

            "answer_text": "I believe just about anything that you monetize online must have a relatively high number of followers or traffic in order to maintain a stable momentum. Once you can \u201cprove\u201d this to external forces such as businesses who want to advertise on your site, you will be able to have more leverage. Hence, in order to drive that traffic to your site, you need to start optimizing and writing very good, high quality content. Get the word out there through your social media, and have your friends share your blog to get more exposure. Regarding SEO, here is a good way to start: Having fresh and interesting content- Write engaging posts that will attract your audience and will make them stay and explore your site. Content is king.HTML- Although this may sound slightly technical, you may want to learn the basics to optimizing your site. This includes adding H1s and H2s throughout your site, as well as text wrapping to ensure that your content is crawler friendly.Alt Text- This is just a fancy way of saying to add descriptions to your images. On the backend of your site\u2019s platform- whether Wordpress, Wix, etc., you\u2019ll be able to find an option to add an Alt Text to your images. Do this for all of your images- this is a must.Keyword research- Make sure you are using the correct platforms to do your keyword research and that you are using the relevant keywords at least 2\u20133 times and not more than 4 times throughout the relevant blog post/page.Be Persistent- Perhaps one of the most important things to consider in SEO is that it is not a one time thing. You should constantly be updating your site with new content, and optimizing as much as you can (text wrapping, alt text, keyword integration,etc.)That should be more than enough to help you get started. Good luck! ",

Before you start your blog, you should be through the questions mentioned below \ud83d\udc47. What topics are you planning to cover?What is the purpose of your blog?Have you thought of a name?Is it going to be weekly blog or daily blog?Do you have enough knowledge to write intensively about the subject Matter? Once you get some clarity, go through a few (WordPress) and blogger blogs. If you have time make accounts on both and see which one fulfills your requirement. I have personally used both of them and I\u2019d suggest you to go with WordPress. After making your account and doing the meticulous job of updating your profile and bio, start writing and posting. This is where the real work begins. Now most people quit the moment they make a blog. But the success of a blog is directly proportional to how consistent you are. You have to keep your audience hooked. If it\u2019s a weekly blog, make sure you\u2019re not missing even for a week. Connect all your social media accounts and keep your connections posted. Content market is blooming these days. Starting a blog can do wonders for your business and life if done diligently. I Hope You Like This ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is to build a website. You can try platforms like Siterubix which offer free website building. Once you set up a website or a blog and start generating traffic, you can earn money through these 6 ways: Affiliate programs:  Two important things to make sure you know are: 1. Who is your customer 2. What problem are you solving To try and explain this a little better I will give you an example. My first product that I promoted was a natural colic product for infants. The natural product would ease the stomach ache for babies, it would also help with the babies gas problems and this would lead to a happier baby. I researched websites that talked about colic. I visited forums and chats where parents could talk about their issues, I borrowed books at the library... I have two kids myself so I had some real life experience as well. What I found out was that my customer is a woman, mother, age 24 \u2013 35... I created a profile of the typical \u201dcustomer\u201d. The problem I was solving was an emotional problem for the mother and the family. Not being able to help your infant is very difficult for a mother, she feels helpless and wants to do anything she can to ease the pain. The crying also puts a lot of stress on the parents and the rest of the family. So some of the problems I was solving by offering this product were: Help the mother feel good about \u201dfixing the problem\u201d.Get rid of the pain and gas problems for the baby.Reduce the stress on the whole familyAlso around holidays when you have family events the sales went up. The parents want to be able to be around the rest of the family and relatives without a sad, crying baby.With my colic site I signed up for affiliate programs. I did a review site and compared the different programs. I found the affiliate programs by typing in the following into Google: colic + affiliate programs So your keyword + affiliate program.The first option that shows up is ColicCalm and that is the program that I focused on as my top choice. I had my first sale with ColicCalm I will never forget the $4 I made my family thought I`d won the lottery ;). To me it meant that Internet Marketing worked and it can be done! Other affiliate marketing programs are: ClickbankCommission JunctionShareaSaleBlueSnap used to be PlimusMarketHealthThese are a few that I have used myself and they work great. Adsense ads and other advertising programs Adsense ads are another way to make money online. You sign up an account with Google Adsense, after approval you can log in and get an ad code that you add to your own site. When you add this ad code ads will show in your post, page or sidebar. When visitors click on your ads you will get paid for it. The payout to you depends on competition and demand, it varies highly from $0.1 up to $15 - 20 per click. You are allowed to add 3 ad blocks to every page/post and you can customize it so that it blends in with your theme and content. I use the plugin \u201dquick adsense\u201d to make it as easy as possible to add the ads whereever I want them. What other Ad programs are out there? Yahoo! Bing Network Contextual Ads http://Kontera.com Infolinks - Innovative Ads Powered by Intent Chitika | Online Advertising Network Building a list Another great way to make money with a website is to build a list, by capturing your visitors email addresses. By doing this it allows you to keep in contact with your visitors. By giving them value and solutions to their problems you become the person to go to in this field. The easiest way to capture an email from a visitor is by giving them something in return for their email address. In this case I put together a small e-book about colic and different ways to ease colic. They got the e-book for free by leaving their email address. This way I could continue staying in contact with the visitor. The easiest way to stay in contact and to collect emails is by using a program /software that can help you with this. Personally I use Aweber and have done so for years. It is easy to use and it keeps track of your emails, follow up emails and broadcast emails to your different lists. Amazon products I also added some more colic products for my review sites, some of the products I got from Amazon.com. Since it is a physical product they had a lot of different options to choose from there.  The great thing when you add products from Amazon.com is that you get commission from any other products your visitor buys when you send through purchase. Starting out you will get 4% commission but the more products you sell the higher commission you will get.  In my case the products were not very expensive but if you target more expensive products you can make good money with Amazon.com. For example a $1200 TV or camera will give you a $48 with 4% commission. The advantage is as I said before if they purchase anything at all, not even related to your product you still get paid.  Relevant advertisers Another way to make some money with your site is by contacting relevant companies and ask if they would like to advertise on your site. If this is the direction you want to take I would recommend you have some traffic and stats to show your potential advertisers when you contact them. A plugin that makes all this very easy that I use myself is OIO publisher, it automates the whole process. You can add the ad blocks where you want them, the advertiser clicks on them and can sign up right there and then, payment can be done through Paypal. If you want to go the easy way you can go through a company like BuySellAds that will connect the two, website owner and advertiser.  Create your own product If you are completely new to internet marketing I would suggest that you start out with affiliate marketing, when you know how to get traffic and turn that traffic in to buyers then you might want to move on and create your own product. Don`t get me wrong creating your own product is a great way to make money and it should be a long term goal but getting some experience first will only benefit you.

            "answer_text": "Step By Step Walkthrough: How I Earned My First Dollar (And More) Blogging  Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash I've always been a writer. Ever since I was a kid I was either creating and drawing comic books or writing creative short stories in my first grade class. In college, the fellas I shared my dorm floor with and I would workshop skits that we'd perform\u200a\u2014\u200aof course I'd take more the role of \"writer\" than \"actor.\" Until recently have I started to explore the world of blogging formulating an income through it. I remember over a year ago I bought my first domain name- HUSTLE | LOS ANGELES | WHERES THE FIDELITY (I just typed in the address in my search bar\u2026 #cringe) I had thoughts in my head and believed I needed to write about them and share them with the world. I didn't have any strategy or plan. I just chose to write. I told myself I was going to write everyday no matter what. I wrote about so many different things. I wrote about the sex escapades I was having with a former coworker.I wrote about how I thought a \"good\" conversation was similar to the exchange of information similar to what a computer goes through processing 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s.I even wrote a review about a Normandy Cidre that I bought and drank.Again, it was pretty much an adjunct, shotgun approach to putting my voice into the airwaves. Originally, I thought the way I was going to make money doing this was to put out all the thoughts that was in my head into the World Wide Web and produce such unique and creative stories that advertisers would be lining up to take my bidding of putting their product on my site. Oh boy\u2026 While you could generate an income off advertising on your site, you are probably going to be making pennies on the dollar for a long time (if anything at all) unless you are building or have a titan of a site already that generates millions of views on a monthly basis. But then why would you be reading this article? You probably aren't there yet. You are most likely a writer or a blogger that knows their way around their own site. Perhaps you promote your material on various social media platforms. Perhaps you publish your work on information exchange/publishing sites such as Medium and Quora. And perhaps you have generated millions of views to your name. Good on you. But you still haven't seen a single dollar from all the painstaking slapping of the keyboard. Hell, you're going to need to make money to pay for the carpal-tunnel care you're going to need in the near future if all this typing persists. Over the past year I have spent countless hours and hundreds of dollars on building my platform in order to spread my word, full of its insightful value, and ultimately turn an income from all the hard work. I have finally started to do just that. Below I have a step by step guide of how I did this. I fully believe that if you adopt the practices I have laid out, you too can find a viable financial reward for yourself.  Step 1: Purchase your domain and hosting service. This is crucial.  https://bit.ly/2rwcnrl I know there are a lot of \"blogging gurus\" out there today that say hosting your own site is a thing of the past. They are probably saying all you need is a service to provide you with a landing page and from there, the sky's the limit. I disagree for a few reasons\u2026 The landing page provider/CRM/Email marketing service is generally more expensive than purchasing a domain and hosting service on an annual basis. Take for instance Clickfunnels- probably the top dog of landing page providers in terms of their own sales revenue and also the promises they claim to convert more leads and sales. Their entry level subscription is priced out at $97/month. You're looking at almost $1200 annually for this service and you are just starting out. Not sustainable in my opinion. I use Squarespace and have my domain and hosting at just under $250 for the year. This, for me, is a more cost effective and sustainable option for bloggers starting out.With the sites that provide a landing/squeeze page, you aren't in ownership of the address- the provider is. I own my domain. I pay for it and carved it out of the the internet. If I were to go with another provider, again let's use Clickfunnels, they are in full ownership of the domain they provide you. Perhaps in the short term if you are looking to grow a list over the course of 6 months and have the proper backing to use their software in order to do so, vaya con dios. However, if you're like me and you are bootstrapping and looking to build something great over the long haul, this isn't sustainable.When you purchase your domain (sometimes can just be your full name) you are carving out your first piece at your stake of the treasure chest of the blogging market that's ripe for the taking. Step 2: Blog everyday\u200a\u2014\u200awrite compelling articles and master headlines. The truth of the matter is, no one knows about you if you don't give them an opportunity to know about you. You have to get your voice out into the ocean of online content writing. The Overnight Success is just a myth. Perhaps there are a few people that can achieve insane virality in just a few articles, however they are on the fringe of the bell curve here. What your main focus should be in blogging is to flood the airwaves with your content. Don't be obnoxious, that can have adverse effects, but make sure you're writing consistently. Rome wasn't built in a day It's cliche, I know, but it's true. It's especially true with your blogging. So you're writing consistently and still no one is noticing your work- even on Medium or Quora\u2026 What do your headlines look like? Seriously, you need to consider this. I know you're a writer or an artist. You want to be creative and cunning with your headlines so the other creatives will recognize your brilliance. Okay, do that. Be a poor writer for the rest of your life. The real writer is also and entrepreneur and marketer. What content does your audience want? Furthermore, how are you going to convince them that your article is worthwhile? The answer is by writing compelling headlines. People do judge a book by its cover, or judge an article by its headline in this case. Jon Morrow, world class blogger, has great resources on his website of where to start with crafting optimal headlines:  https://smartblogger.com/how-to-write-a-blog-post/ Step 3: Build your Call to Action and Squeeze Page You've been gaining a bunch of traffic and getting views. You've been consistently writing and publishing valuable content for your audience. Your popularity and influence has been growing. What do you do now to leverage all of that influence. The Holy Grail of blogging is your email list. You email list is the Traffic You Own (according to Russell Brunson of Clickfunnels\u200a\u2014\u200asee, I'm done picking on Clickfunnels). When you have an email list, you are able to direct this audience towards your content (and later your products or services) when and how you want. In order to build your email list effectively you are going to need a provider. Again, in light of bootstrapping the best provider I have found starting out is Mailchimp. They are the best because of their free plan starting out. You have the ability to grow your list for free for your first 2000 email subscribers. This is important for you aren't going to grow your list to 10k overnight (Morrow's golden number for a proper list).  (screenshot of my most recent email blast: 36% open rate ) Mailchimp allows you to grow your list and also provide landing page templates (if you aren't going the route of purchasing your own domain). You can also use plugins to add to any page of your Squarespace site. Linking your Mailchimp to Squarespace is incredibly simple. When you have built an email list, you are done just hoping that your audience will organically see your content. You now have the power to guide them straight to it. Let me define the two terms above for you briefly: Call To Action: What message you are conveying in order to get your audience to take a certain action. This is a pull to get your audience to do something. Here, it is to get or receive your FREE giveaway (ebook, guide, quiz, survey, report etc).Squeeze Page: Once you get your audience to take a specific action (click the link to the promised free product) they are sent to a landing page. Here there is only two choices for the person to take: they either exchange their email for the free product or they exit the page. It's binary. No other choice. https://bit.ly/2FVAvsR (You can find an example from my squeeze page here) Once you are able to convince a reader to exchange their email with your valuable content, you have the ability to enroll them into your sphere and take on the responsibility of crafting your future communication with them. Step 3.5: Regular communication Regular communication is key. Just because you have the email doesn't mean that you have \"won\" the relationship with your audience. Far from it. You have to nurture this prize you have been given with the email. The reader you gained was interested in your story. So take them on your ride. What are you working on?What are you thinking of?Where are you going?What are you building?What I have found is a once a week newsletter that is promoting valuable information that I have found, the sharing of new articles that I have written. I also like to start conversations with my audience\u200a\u2014\u200awhat are they interested in right now? What content would be valuable for them in the future? Here, you are continually building trust and value for your newly obtained fan. This brings us to the next step. Step 4: Selling your product or service This is where it all comes together and all the hard work you put in prior to this step is rewarded. You are selling your product or service that is consistent to what you've been blogging about and helps your audience solve a problem they have been dealing with. For me, my first product is my 8 Step Guide of how I went viral with over 2 million views in just a matter of a few months. There are many problems I solve for my audience in my product: How to reach millions of viewers organically without spending a single dollarHow to leverage your new found visibility into a secure credibility as a writer/blogger/influencerHow to craft an intriguing headline every reader will want to click.How to structure and format \u2018The Perfect Post\u2019How to use language to your advantage in your writing to trigger an emotional response from the reader (which encourages them to share it with someone else).The 1 habit every single content writer needs to master in order to become successful.How to transform your mindset into creating quality work that primed for viral sharing.How to identify and utilize my unfair advantage in find the right \u201cpools\u201d and areas to post your content thus giving you maximum exposure most people don\u2019t know about.How to use utilize online publications and ditch your blog in order to create a massive audience & become a thought leader.Now again, I do all of my sales through my Squarespace site. You probably can open up an ecommerce store through Clickfunnels or another provider as such. Squarespace has great plugins that allow for commerce (I use the Stripe plugin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can also use Paypal for business).  (Remembering my first sale\u200a\u2014\u200aGot to love the process)  This is a chance for you to consider what you are going to sell. There are so many different industries within the blogging sphere that are ripe with an audience looking to solve a problem. I am working now with my boxing trainer on creating his blog and thus his future income stream. To give you an idea, we are work shopping giving away a free guide that is filled with intense ab workouts that can give you six pack abs without needing to commit to much time at all during workouts. He's a training wizard. For the first time in my life, I have a six pack. I know this is possible. This is going to be on our CTA and Squeeze page with his articles. We are then going to build a comprehensive 30 day video series\u200a\u2014\u200aone work out a day, 4 days a week with 3 rest days that will help his audience get into the best shape of their life. This is going to be his product. Again, there are so many opportunities here. There are probably hundreds, if not thousands of people in the exercise blogging arena. One might think there isn't any more room for us. That's the wrong mindset to have. There is abundance on the internet and people are looking for answers. You are that answer. It will take time. It will take sacrifice. There will be moments you feel you aren't making any progress. There will be moments where you feel like you want to give up. You are your own bottleneck. Just as there are hundreds if not thousands of people that purchase a domain and start blogging, there are just as many who bow out of the game. Don't be one of those people and you propel your chances of winning and creating the life you always knew you could have.  https://i.gifer.com/7cXx.gif Good luck!

            "answer_text": "There are various ways of earning money from blogging. But first, you have to do two things right. First, make the blog website presentable to its visitors so that it leaves a long-lasting effect in their minds and you make a loyal followers list. The next thing is to have quality content in your site so that visitors find informative articles from which they are benefited on a regular basis. Once these two factors are taken care of, there is an immediate need to monetize your site to earn money in blogging.  Today, we have come up with the most profitable ways to earn money from blogging for a website that has a fair rate of web traffic. 1. Google Ad-sense \u2013 Google\u2019s advertisement program is the world\u2019s biggest payout ad system, and almost all popular sites have them. First, you need to have enough content in your site which is plagiarism free, then you could apply for Ad-sense approval.Google Ad-sense has various ad units of different sizes with several customization options to suit your theme color and space. It is a pay per click advertisement, and with more ad impressions, the quality of ads will increase, i.e., you will get more money for every single click.But in case you don\u2019t get your Ad-sense approved, there is nothing to get disheartened. There are so many alternatives to it. Several other popular pay per click advertisement options are Info-links, Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide or clicksor to name a few. Otherwise, try the following options. 2. Affiliation Market \u2013 This could be the biggest source of income for any website, and for some, it is even better than Google Ad-sense. Affiliation program means you are going to advertise product links with images in your site that belongs to someone else and when a user clicks on it and buys that product, you will get a commission of nearly 20% \u2013 50% on the price of the product. If you use product ads that are relevant to your site\u2019s content, chances are high for users to check them out. All leading e-commerce sites such as shopping carts, online course sellers, hosting sites and so on have a free sign up affiliation program, and they can be placed on any website. They don\u2019t have any parameter for approval. 3. Show External Sponsored Posts \u2013 Survey has shown that most users tend to click on them as the topics of those sponsored posts are eye-catching and tempting. For every click get will receive (more) ",

Affiliate marketing is when you partner with companies to promote their product. You\u2019re given a special link, and if someone makes a purchase through that link, you receive a commission. It\u2019s a simple way to make money blogging because you don\u2019t have to create your own product and market it. You just have to work on the marketing for that post! If you haven't pin-pointed your niche but believe in a number of products that you've already purchased, try the Amazon Affiliate Program. You simply apply to partner with them and if you can promote and sell a product through the link they provide you, you make a percentage. If you aren't fully immersed with what affiliate marketing is by this point, I came across a comprehensive article through Jon The Online gold.  Once you start developing your niche and mission, make sure you are promoting products and services that are in line with such! Your reputation is on the line\u2026 Interlink your posts with each other. Are you interlinking your posts together? A simple way to increase revenue from your blog is by interlinking relevant posts with each other. If you interlink posts in a way that encourages others to click to other articles on your blog. You are encouraging readers to stay on your site .With this, the longer they are there \u2192 the more information that is absorbed \u2192the more they begin to trust you \u2192the more they are willing to pay for what you are offering! This does a number of things: Increases ad revenue (If you are working on that \u2014 I don't have much experience here)And, increases the likelihood of affiliate sales due to seeing these links pop up in more places.If someone visits your blog and loves the article they read, make it effortless for them to find other similar, amazing content you wrote. Your blog tells a story, and there are likely older posts your newer readers haven\u2019t read. You can easily connect your posts together by linking to other posts each time you write a post. Linking to your other posts in articles will decrease your bounce rate, increase your viewership, and make it easier to earn money from your blog. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, let me give the answer to your question.  I am a tech blogger and I earn a lot from my blogging career. Today I am going to share my secret tips or hack with you. 1. Affiliate marketing: Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to make a very good amount of money from your blog. This how affiliate marketing work for blogging This could be done by promoting affiliate products and services to your audience, you can earn a steady income from the commissions you earn. Different affiliate programs offer different commissions, but generally, you can get anywhere between 5% 8% and 35% or %50 of the price. This is a great opportunity for new bloggers as they usually start with Amazon and grow some income with their blog from there. With that being said let\u2019s dive in to see ways you can monetize your blog and make money from your blog. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are new or old the only thing that matters is how good you are with your skills to create quality content to attract new visitors to your site. Try to master the paid ads and in that way, you will be able to earn well with affiliate marketing. Select a product that adds value to your customer\u2019s life, or maybe that can solve some problem your customer is facing. Write a great review about that product, add the affiliate link in your content, and try to drive as much traffic as you can. And if someone clicks on your link and makes a purchase you earn a commission. 2. Monetize With CPC: This is the most common and popular way most bloggers make money with their blog, especially the beginners. An estimate shows that more than 70% of bloggers in the world use ads for making money. Ads are really great ways because you don\u2019t need to do anything. You just need to focus on creating valuable content that will bring in traffic. To make a good amount of income with ads depends on traffic & CPC of the keyword which is generating the traffic for the website. If a High CPC keyword ranking & generating most of the traffic for the website then income will be great. On the other side, Low CPC keywords will generate less money. Guess a blog has a keyword of CPC 5$, generating 1000 visitors per day and 20 of them are clicking on ads. This will make 100$ a day for the website. On the other hand, A keyword of CPC 1$, generating 1000 views per day, and 20 of them clicking on the ads will make 20$ per day. Many bloggers use Google Adsense services to monetize their blogs. Some argue that Adsense doesn\u2019t offer the best value and rely on alternatives to earn an income. Indeed, a few alternatives actually offer twice as much as Adsense. In any case, advertising is one way many bloggers have made serious money online. Most bloggers use Google Adsense services to monetize their blogs. Some argue that Adsense doesn\u2019t offer the best value and income and rely on alternatives to earn an income. 3. Sell Digital Product: Digital products are also the best way to make money from your blog. You can sell various types of digital services from your website in which you have a piece of good knowledge. There are various types of easy digital service which you can consider to sell from your blog/website. If your idea is to not advertise other people\u2019s products on your blog, or if you are looking for another extra income, consider selling digital products. This can include items such as: eBooks \u2013 ebook is a great way to make money blogging. Put together your knowledge about specific topics and create an ebook about them.Online Courses \u2013 create an ebook and then expand on the same topic in their online course. You can easily sell the courses from your blog/website but for this, you will have to spend a little bit of money for a good mic and after that in marketing.Freelance Writing \u2013 Be a guest post for others or write for a client. You can earn a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars per month working as a freelance writer.4. Sponsor post A sponsored post is that post when you promote any company product in your blog/website by taking some money from that company. Getting sponsorship for any product you must need a good amount of monthly visitors. Getting visitors to your blog is the only way companies will approach you for their product. If you have a good looking website and niche blog you can offer a sponsor post form other companies. Sponsored posts are one form of income that you can make some decent amount of money from your blog. Although it takes effort, time, and mostly it is not passive but it\u2019s one of the easiest ways to earn income from blogging. You can make a few hundred dollars from each sponsored post or even more depending on your niche and specifically your brand. If you have a small niche brand with high engagement and followers you can still get into a sponsored post-program. 5. Advertising/ Promotion: There are two answers, depending on what kind of niche you are in. You don\u2019t really monetize the content itself. Even if you place AdSense and banner ads, you aren\u2019t likely to make that much. If you have a business, blog content can add value to your existing products and make you look professional to your target audience.If you are a professional blogger, you can recognize this value to businesses, and offer businesses ghost-written or placed articles about the company or business and post it to your relevant, established blogs. Some bloggers do this for themselves, and create their own info products, or sell their own product or services.If you can do both: place your articles and run your own business, you can make a lot of money. But becoming a good enough businessperson AND blogger takes a lot of effort from you and hard work. These are the five tips that I use on my website to earn a lot Please Upvote if you like my answer.

            "answer_text": "Having a blog, or the so-called ''blogging'' is one of the most effective and common ways to make money online these days.  It is not necessarily the easiest way of making cash, but it for sure is a very good, efficient way. This is all due to a huge amount of people using the internet nowadays and everything being transferred from paper into websites. Money also went from paper to digital numbers on the screens. Just look at what is happening with the cryptocurrencies and all those blockchains. Crazy, right? When it comes to starting a blog, I have to say it is not easy. I mean, the basics are, in fact, more than simple and easy to learn but the whole thing of turning your blog from a simple blog to an actual business is nowhere near easy. So, the process of making money from a blog usually looks like this: You set up a blog2. You start creating content which first has to be useful and easy to read (if you target the wider audience) 3. You start searching for readers 4. As soon as you find readers, make sure you deliver what they expect out of your blog 5. Build engagement with your readership 6. Start making money out of your own audience through one or more different income streams The whole procedure does sound quicker and effortless than what it actually is. Because truth to be told it may take you years to build a strong base and a good constant audience. However, once you put a real effort to get that, you are on a good path. There is a huge amount of sources and ways to make money out of your blog. But, firstly you need your blog completely set and successful. Right after that it is far easier than anyone really assume. You can make money out of ''selling'' guest posts. This means basically charging people to do a post on your blog for a link to their own site. You can make money out of affiliate marketing where you will get paid to promote different kinds of products, programs, services and sites in articles. This probably is one of the easiest ways to make money when having a blog. You are going to write content either way. With affiliate marketing, you place links of the companies that have paid you in the article body, and you are all set. You can make money out of advertisements. Most big sites and blogs do survive because of this source of income. People will, in fact, pay you to get advertised on your site, and this is proven to work very well for both sides. You can make money out of selling services through your blog. You can sell courses and other services such as design, coaching, and freelancing. You can also make money out of promoting offline businesses on your blog. Other ways of making money from your blog are by selling blogs, syndications, and donations. There are really many options that bloggers can wisely use to derive income from their blogs. You will find ways that work for you the best, and make the most out of them. Be wise. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to write for money through blogging, listen up, it's not what you think. You have to start with the right mindset. Here is my step by step approach to start writing blogs for money. Step 1: Get the right mindset. The right mindset for blogging for money is not the mindset of a hobby or passionate writer. You have to have the mindset of a business person. How do business people treat about blogging? First, research. They want to make sure that whatever topic that they'll be going to get into, will make money. Next, they decide to invest money in content generation and research. This means going to places like Fiverr or retaining inexpensive yet high-quality writers like Gene Eugenio and others. Third, they actively seek to learn. In other words, they don't just put their money buying stuff, getting stuff done and then waiting for cash to appear. Instead, they look at the results that they are getting, and then they try to figure if what could be the problems. Is the problem traffic? Is it because of low conversion? Or maybe because of low clicks? And then they come up with answers. Fourth, they constantly experiment until they get the right answers. They're not content with trying just one answer and then another and then another. Instead, they look at what is the best answer given the circumstances, can I buy a better answer? Can I rent one? Do I have to do it myself? And they keep at it until they get to the right results. This is how you blog for money. It really all boils down to your mindset. Because with the right mindset, the rest of the process takes care of itself. What else is there? There's quite a bit of thing to do. Step 2: You have to pick the right niche. Step 3: You have to get the right content. Step 4: You have to drum up traffic. Step 5: You have to boost conversions where you blog. As important as these steps may be to your bottom line, they fail in comparison with the first absolute stuff. You have to have the right mindset. You have to look at your blog as a business. If you don't do that all you have is a hobby. You probably don't need me to remind you that most people only put in time and effort into their hobbies when they feel they have the time and the energy to do so. If your hobby, which is your blog isn't producing the kind of money that you hoped, you probably won't be as motivated. And before you know it, you'd given up. Don't let that happen. With a bit of advance planning, your blog can be a success. It really all boils down to you treating it like a business. Don't be cheap with both of your time and money when it comes to blogging. The good news is you get what you put in. If you invest enough resources and time into it, it will take care of you. I'm not just saying this, but a lot of people actually sold their blogs for millions of dollars. Look up the story of Viral Nova, that is one blog of many that sold for seven figures. In fact, if you go to places like Flippa, you'll notice that there a lot of people money making blogs for tens of thousands of dollars. There's a market out there. But for you to get there, you have to have the right mindset. I wish you nothing but success. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is part of my blog post \u2014 make sure you read the original post here: How to Start and Grow your Blog Like a Pro (2018 Edition). Maybe the most pleasurable part of blogging is making some extra (or serious) cash from your blog. Once you got your blog set up and published some posts, you can start monetizing it. Remember, making money from blogging depends a huge deal on the level of trust you make with your readers, so unless you\u2019re already an established authority, it takes time to make money from blogging. Depending on your niche, there are some ways to monetize your blog. Here are some of the most popular ones: Selling your own ebooks/ecourses: If you know enough about your topic, it\u2019s a great idea to launch your ebooks or ecourses to make money. Almost all professional bloggers have an ebook for sale on their website and they\u2019re making decent money with it. Ecourses have also grown very popular. They\u2019re much cheaper than physical courses and people love their interactive content. Affiliate marketing: If you don\u2019t have a product of your own, you can help others sell their products and get your commission. Affiliate marketing is very popular these days especially because almost all Saas companies have an affiliate program. Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, and other ecommerce giants offer affiliate programs as well \u2014 you need to apply, be approved, and then start selling their products to earn a commission. Ads and sponsored posts: If you have a good traffic to your blog, you can display some ads or sponsored posts to make money. Ad networks such as Google Adsense could be a great choice. You can also accept sponsored posts and receive money upfront, but you need to be an influencer in your niche first. Freelancing: One of the greatest merits of having your own blog is the possibility of showcasing your expertise. If you\u2019re interested in writing, editing, designing, programming, etc. you can find good paying clients from among your blog\u2019s audience. ",

You can blog on your own native language or any other chosen language. or make it multi linguistic one (WordPress have a good multi-linguistic features).  You need to write at least 400-800 words article on daily basis for about 6 months to start getting paid for advertisements appearing in your site.  You can also offer paid services or products on your blog. for example I offer article writing in my blog plus business consultancies and advises. Choose any skill you master to pick as a paid gig, if you can draw you can sell your drawings and designs...etc. You can also sell photos you shoot by your mobile! People pays for photos at least 1 dollars per copy! I hope I gave you a good answer! do not forget to send me your blog url so I can visit and check and may be buy some of your services or products.

            "answer_text": "Make More Money from Your Blog with These 5 Persuasive Writing Tips There are several differences between writing copy and writing content. Content is made to provide information. When you write copy, you are attempting to get your readers to take action in some way. You should have a lot of valuable content on your blog. After all, people come to your blog to solve problems and answer questions. There is definitely a place for writing copy on your blog also. You are eventually going to want to make money from your blogging efforts. Some bloggers make upwards of $10,000 per month and are able to quit their dreary, frustrating 9 to 5 jobs because they become very good at writing copy that is persuasive. When you know how to write so that your readers take whatever action you desire, whether that is joining your email list or buying your products and services, you can turn an informational blog into a passive income stream any time you sit down at your keyboard. The following 5 writing tips make your content more readable, while simultaneously improving the odds that your readers will follow your call to action. 1 \u2013 Always Include a Call to Action Even if you are just writing a blog post to tell someone how to find sources for bargain fashion wear, you should include some type of call to action that tells your readers exactly what you want them to do. In this example, you may be running a fashion blog. After you write the post that tells your readers how to save money when buying fashionable clothing, offer a free report or checklist that is related to the subject matter of your post in return for them joining your email list. Always add a call to action to every piece of content you write. 2 \u2013 Break the Rules of Grammar It's okay to begin a sentence with \"and\" or \"but,\" even though your English teacher told you that was a no-no. Don't go out of your way to break these and other grammar rules, but when it makes sense, don't be afraid to do so. When you write like people talk, which often means grammatically incorrect, you develop a real connection with your audience. 3 \u2013 Write in the Second Person Write as if you are talking to someone personally. This means imagine you are speaking to someone in a one-on-one conversation. Writing in the second person means addressing your audience members with terms like \"you,\" \"yours,\" and \"yourself.\" When you address an individual rather than a group, your readers benefit. 4 \u2013 Use the Active Voice, Not Passive The active voice is persuasive. The passive voice is not. Don't say, \"The hamburger was eaten by the man.\" That is unnecessarily indirect. Instead, you would say, \"The man ate the hamburger.\" Think subject + verb + object and not the other way around. 5 \u2013 Make It Easy to Read Your Content Write short sentences. Use short words. Speak simply. Don't use a big word when a small word is all you need. Add descriptive subheadings throughout your post. Make sure your paragraphs are no longer than 3 to 5 sentences long. Break up big blocks of text with white space. These practices make your content easy to scan and easy to read, which means you improve the odds that your entire blog post is consumed. Upvote if you liked. ",

In order to start a blog is easy, the hardest part is how to be creative everyday and keep your the interest of the audience higher, if you do the things right the money will come anyway! My example, I have started my blog in 2016 - I didn\u2019t have any post on it but I have posted on Instagram and I\u2019ve invested very much in my content and my photos, and the proposal for collaboration started to come before my blog to be live.

            "answer_text": "AIOP provides Cloud Linux hosting at no supplimentary costs for the Cloud option that is included in your hosting account by default. Usually, the Cloud option is charged at various costs by other host providers. The Cloud feature ensures that if an issue occurs on any of the members hosting accounts, will isolate that account and will not affect all the others. ----------------------------------- In this module we are going to set up your web site. This is quite a long post, so take your time to read it carefully and if necessary come back several times. To set up your web site, we are going to use a WordPress platform. This allows you to set up your site without knowing anything about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, or any other initials you can think of. It is very easy to install, and I am going to walk you through the whole process. (There are two versions of WordPress. WordPress.com: Create a website or blog is a free blogging site. This is not what we are using. We will be using the WordPress software, but installed on your own site.) Firstly, if you haven't already set up your AIOP hosting account, you need to do that now. Now head on over to GoDaddy to get a domain name. You will first need to set up an account with them. Once you have done that and logged in, type the domain name of your choice into the box where it says \"search for a new domain\" to see if that name is available. HINT 1: Always go for a .com domain, not .co, .net, .org or any of the zillion other possibilities that are around now. People automatically type .com, and if you have one of the others and someone else has or gets the .com, there is a good chance they will end up with at least part of your traffic. HINT 2: We are going to use your site for two things: - to promote your online business - to promote affiliate products in a niche of your choice. We will do this by creating two separate sub-domains on your site. Therefore your domain name needs to be something generic. You could use your own name, or you could use a made up name. For instance, on my main hosting account (which has been running for a long time now) I have the domain name \u201chttp://brijmark.com\u201d, which is made up by combining the first three letters of the names of my two sons and the first initials of their wives. Lynn Fowler The beauty of doing this is that, when you set up your subdomains, you can name them exactly what you want, and not worry that you will not be able to secure a name that relates to your chosen niche. For instance, if your domain name is \u201cCybster Technologies\u201d and you decide you want to promote products in the weight loss niche (one where it is very difficult to get a relevant domain name) you would simply name your subdomain \u201cweightloss.frednerk.com\u201d and reap the SEO benefits. Once you have seen that your chosen domain name is available, click \"Continue to Registration.\" Click \"no thanks\" to all the extras they want to offer you, choose whether you want to register your domain for 1 year or more (the default is 5 years, you will need to select other times from the drop down box.) Proceed through the remaining pages without selecting any of the extras, then proceed to the checkout and pay for your domain. You do not need to do anything else with it just yet.

And eventually you will end up quitting.

Limited time offer. Those days are gone for most of the bloggers where blogging used to be easy money. I used to have 40,000 blogs under my control all unique articles and all SEO optimized. Nowadays competition is so huge and the market is so saturated that if you don\u2019t have a specific niche and are not willing to work hard and give atleast 2 years or 5 years of your life (If you don\u2019t possess the qualities already) then you are bound to fail. Bloggers are hard workers I don\u2019t doubt about it. But webmasters and seo guy are hard workers too and hackers are just working in parallel universe so I won\u2019t comment on them. In today\u2019s world if you want to be a good blogger you need quality as quantity days are gone. In today\u2019s world you need to just do it most honestly and you will not even need an SEO guy. You can host your own blog with wordpress, typepad etc. and you don\u2019t even need webmaster. Just take regular backups otherwise you will get fucked from parallel universe and you will keep wondering who raped you. Just be original and try it out. Once you have traffic you will automatically get advertisers. You can also apply for the Google Adsense which is nonsense for most beginners as they count on it. And Adsense won\u2019t pay to the nonsense guys. It is a tit for tat game. All running on algorithms.

Google Adsense ads are relevant to your content and your blog. Google Adsense can be the best way to earn from a blog if you have a very very high traffic and an awesome content. 2. Do Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to earn money from Blogging. You can easily monetize your blog using affiliate links in your blogs. You can earn a very good amount of money if you place the affiliate links in correct places. Let me explain to you what is affiliate marketing and how affiliate marketing works for your blog. For example, a Company or an individual wants to sell something or increase its sales. So the company or an advertiser gives you the direct link of their services or products. Now you can place these affiliate links into your blog or website. You can add it directly or make use of the different ad formats like banner ads. Now let us assume you have written an article in Samsung Galaxy S8 and have placed the link of the same in your website between the content and If anyone buys that mobile after visiting the advertiser's e-commerce website through your link then you will get a commission or some percentage of the product's total cost. There are many affiliate marketing networks on which you can sign up and start earning from them. Amazon is considered the best affiliate network. It is called as Amazon Associates. There are many other affiliate networks that you can easily find on the internet. Some of them also offer 50% commission for each sale through your link. Isn't that cool? Let us say someone buys a product of 20000 from your link, then you get 10000 directly to your account. :) You can try Clickbank and ShareASale. We will soon write a well-researched article on the 5 best affiliate marketing networks for bloggers. 3. Sell your own products E-commerce: For example, if you have a business and you have a shop or some products like ladies footwear or clothes etc..you can make use of digital marketing and can use your blog to increase your sales. You can place details and Ad formats of your own products. This will definitely increase the sale of your products. Number of people will come to know about your business. They can see all the products directly on their PC or laptops. And if they like them they will place the order. You can add an online payment system to your blog. People can save their time and you can increase the outreach of your products. And if everything goes well you can get orders from your own state and even from other states. So what are you waiting for? 4. Sell your own Digital Products If you are good at designing, and are looking for other methods to earn from your own blog then you can make your own digital products and can sell them on your blog. You can design the following things :-  1. Ebooks 2. Sell your own plugins and themes 3. Sell your own apps 4. Online courses 5. Workshops 6.

Now you will be top on search if your content is big and fully researched. Advertisement is the old way of making money.  I request you that write like people beg to you for the next post or blog. I am giving you my words that people will definately share your content on the social media. Ask some questions to your audience at the last of every post. Build relationship with them. And when you become successful to build relationship then sell your stuff online on the place of ad. Believe me this the way you can make more and more money. But listen, in writing the blog post use many headings and do full research about the topic. If are taking 5 hours to write a blog post then it is necessary to spent 5 hours to advertise your blog. Remember before building an relationship with audience you have to make a good relation with the great blogger of your niche. Yes, you have to do Guest Blogging. It will give you the big backlinks that will give the extreme traffic. Learn grammar. Because google will give preference to them who use the full grammar rules. Read about google panda and hummingbird and penguin.  If you made this stuff possible then sell your stuff and earn money. You can do google that by selling their stuff, bloggers are making $50 million. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to earn money on blogs, first it needs to generate traffic, for which content is the most important. What you write makes a difference in bringing more readers to the blog - based on which you can monetize in a lot of ways.  Here're some of the ways in which money is generated under the assumption that you have a load of readers...  1. Ads. It's just a click in the blogger settings to include ads in your blog. 2. Revenue stream by a sponsor. For eg... you blog regarding soaps... the soap manufacturers contact you for a) trialing their product (for free, of course) and putting a review out there (and who knows maybe you'll get a lifetime free supply of soaps that save you lot of money in long run) , or b) giving you a gift hamper and then running a giveaway for your readers to try out their products (free stuff attracts interest, right?) or c) Money(sponsorship) to run a particular ad or  some post in favor of their soap/company etc. I hope you get the idea...that your content determines your sponsors.3. Affiliate marketing - co-marketing of fellow bloggers/products etc preferably for a fee (since they want to be showcased too to the number of readers you have).4. Last, but certainly not the least : Sell stuffs that bring buyers based on word of mouth marketing via your readers - it could as well be handicrafts to T-shirts (containing super-awesome quotations from your previous blog posts etc) on the side...without sidelining your content.  Common pointer for all of above: Since content is what your readers come for, ensure that that's where your blogs primary focus is. ",

            "answer_text": "Bloggers often feel disheartened after writing a lot of stuff, and not making enough money. The only problem is that they don\u2019t hoe to make money by starting a blog. Simply writing something gibberish and expecting revenues out of it, isn\u2019t fair on your part. The first and the foremost thing before writing a blog post is Keyword Research. Once you target the right keywords, and present some informative stuff on the topic, there are good chances that your blog will get decent Search engines traffic, which will help you in improving the SERP rankings in turn. Second thing that you need to do is to understand the likes and dislikes of your visitors. For example gadget lovers hate to read lengthy 700-1000 words blog posts, and often get irritated with sites that don\u2019t give them what they want. On the contrary, hostings geeks don\u2019t mind reading pages and pages to discover more. As a result, a lot depends upon your blogging niche, but the bottom-line is that you got to value your readers\u2019 interests, and work accordingly. Having built a good rapport in the blogosphere, something that you need to do is to analyze who your competitors are, what keywords they target, and how to beat them! It may not be fairly easy to outsmart the likes of , AOL Autos, Yahoo Autos, if you\u2019re starting a new automotive blog, but in the longer run you can definitely research the right keywords, which aren\u2019t their prime focus. And, you can establish your monopoly on those KWs, and generate handsome revenues from it. So, remember, in the end it\u2019s about learning how to make money with the blogging is with right keywordand establish your supremacy in a particular niche, rather than trying to be the jack of all trades, and master of none! Google AdSense, amazon , Chitika, and Adbrite can be the best bets to make advertising revenues once you drive decent traffic to your blog with the right keywords! I know you must be tired of listening to the fact that you can make money online blogging, but if your blog is relatively new, Google Adsense program may NOT approve your application for the next 6months. So, does that mean you can\u2019t make money online blogging without AdSense? Well not really; there are many more ways to make money blogging such as selling links on your blog, writing sponsored reviews, and even providing guest blogging services to those who\u2019re always in need of new content. Secondly, you can participate in affiliate marketing programs such as Amazon, eBay, ClickBank, CJ and other affiliates in your niche. Next, you can make money online blogging and providing social media optimization services, promoting stories on digg, mixx, stumble, reddit, and other popular social bookmarking sites. Lastly, you can apply on Kontera, InfoLinks, and other in-text advertising programs; Bidvertiser and AdBrite may approve your application fairly easily, and you don\u2019t have to wait for your Google AdSense application to be approved to make money online.

            "answer_text": "This is seventh time I\u2019m getting a similar question, but I\u2019d love to answer it all over again. You have interest in topics that has covered good part of the web. However you can provide only textual content for movies, fashion, psychology & education but for music I\u2019d recommend to opt for videos. To begin with let\u2019s walk through most basic steps for blogging. So it goes like this. A decent blog post should begin with the problem itself, then solution followed by alternatives (if any) and conclusion. Now what is the difference between a blog post with very little or no traffic (from search engine) and a super hit blog post with huge traffic (majorly from search engine) ? What magic do those people add in that post which makes it a magnet to iron solid traffic from search engine ? After following the pattern of the blog posts from top bloggers/content marketers I realized one major thing, \u201ccontent is the king\u201d if you manage to provide detailed & deep content to a problem, you are actually bribing search engine to bring tremendous traffic to your posts/site/blogs. So let\u2019s have a look at those magical wands that make these things happen. Things mentioned here are with respect to you, hence putting you in shoes of those top content marketers and making you owner of a super hit blog for a while. Enjoy !! Niche: Identify the area you can write amazingly on. Doesn't matter how small it is, it's still an information for people seeking it, how to open a campaign bottle is still a information for a person who\u2019s has never tried doing it. Be a little choosy while rounding off a niche, do check the preferred list of niche by google adsense that are likely to get paid highestIf you don\u2019t believe this, search anything on google and check the results count under the search box, you\u2019ll be amazed to see how many people on this planet think exactly like you. There many people seeking information always, no exceptions. Analyze what other people are serving, find what they're missing. If you're really a expert of that topic, you surely will find a loop hole as there always is. No one is perfect. Once you decide the content, you\u2019ll have a clear picture of your target audience.Audience: Research on your audience. What are they looking for, how they act to a piece of information, how to implement it and all that\u2019s needed to establish a good ambiance with your readers. Tools like Alexa & SEMrush would be useful to understand your target audience with the content (keyword wise) as base. Demographics play a super important role in connecting with readers. It\u2019s as important as your content. Delivering a good quality content at wrong time means nothing to reader as they already have information with them (doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s lower in quality than yours). Demographics gets you that knowledge of right time. Before you publish your content spend time to work where your future loyal reader spend their time also find the reason why they spend their time there ? what that site serves, how they serve and how differently you can serve to your readers.Platform: Choose a platform to write on. Be it WordPress,blogger, wix or anything else. Domain name first choose your domain name wisely, the name of your blog is face of your business. Unfortunately all the single words are taken and cannot be used until released by the previous owners. To begin with choose a simple name, you can change it later anytime. Next is web hosting. Get a good plan that suits your wallet and to your idea. Buy a web hosting on platforms like bluehost, hostgator or GoDaddy. While choosing a name make sure you exclude hyphens, numbers and other special characters. They\u2019re hard to remember. Make sure your site name is straight and simple.Post: Start posting the content. But I'd advice you to create at least 20 drafts (if starting from scratch) and post it in one go. Research well and plot well. Content is the king. If you serve what user is looking for, you're god to them. More users view your piece more you'll rise in search engine ranking. There are some key points under this, let's have look at it one by one.Content: Doesn't matter if topic is same, if this was a problem then we wouldn't see more than 1 result in search result page. Your content within is what'll make the difference. Once you grow, it's highly important to be consistent in quality. Constantly and swiftly publishing quality content is bliss. Create quality content that is sticky enough for readers, once you scale up your sticky content will do wonders. So it\u2019s better to do this right from day one. Keywords: Keywords are baits to search engine. Keywords if rightly used, will draw huge traffic to your site effortlessly. Keywords are really important for blog post to get recognized. Keywords play most important role in bringing your content to readers. As search engine does not remember the information by content, it remembers by keywords. With these reason in mind it is highly important to blend your keywords in right manner. With right manner I mean not spamming/stuffing your article with keywords, search engine bots would directly declare your content as spam in case keywords are over used.Opt for long tail keywords in a detailed blog post, this increases chances of getting indexed well. As the crawlers reports long tail keywords first and then the short tail keywords (since 97% of searches happen with long tail keywords)SEO Optimize: SEO optimized sites are magnets to iron solid traffic (which in turn transforms into revenue by various means) and as a surprise wordpress takes care of most of the SEO. Take care of few SEObasics to begin with. Advanced level SEO tips aren\u2019t needed for now.Practice: These are the baby steps one needs to take in order to slowly but surely grow. Continuously, innovatively and cautiously govern your activities over these basic steps. Create your own schedule to manage your work for the blog, being consistent in producing content is highly recommended (but never be consistent in the content you produce, keep improving on how & how much you deliver. Consistency is death)Earnings: Nothing's best other than Adsense for a high traffic website. If I were to explain adsense in simple words it'd be \u201cMore traffic your site/blog has costlier it is for an advertiser to use your blog as ad space under Google Adsense\u201d so having a good traffic website monetized by adsense is the best decision. This however is a step that's applicable no where in near future if your staring from scratch. Affiliate may or may not work at high traffic website, but adsense is 100% full proof option once you have commendable traffic. Once you follow & continuously follow these basic steps I bet you\u2019ll yourself come up with amazing ideas on how to excel at what your learning right now. That\u2019s the magic of learning, once you learn it well you\u2019re ready to teach the innovation you had after learning it. The steps mentioned herein has effectively, magically, practically, technically & amazingly worked for me. Hence expect the same in your case too. Share your thoughts on the answer in comments. Share the answer to let concerned people know about the tactics of earning from blogging. I hope I\u2019ve answered your questions the way you expected it to be answered. All the best for your future. Aavjo, Shubham Davey **Are you pro-active ? Follow my work on Blogging tips & tricks for more updates** ",

            "answer_text": "There are many methods to make money from blogging. Various options are as below.: (Few of them might have already been mentioned earlier) 1) Join an Advertisement Network: The easiest way to make money from your website is to join an advertising network and then show their ads on your blog. Choosing an ad network might be a tricky task. There are many ad networks available in the market based on CPM, CPC, In-text advertising, etc. Analyze and try different ad networks to see which turn out best for you. CPM \u2013 You are paid according to the number of times the advertiser\u2019s banner is displayed on your site. The amount you earn is typically calculated based on the number of thousand impressions of the banner (impressions = number of times the banner is displayed), often abbreviated CPM (cost per thousand, with the M being the Latin numeral for thousand). That is, $10 CPM means that you get paid $10 for 1,000 displays of the banner. Note: If you want to join CPM ad network, I would suggest trying Adversal. Also Read: Adversal CPM Ad Network Reviews CPC \u2013 Under CPC scheme, you are only paid when visitors click the advertiser\u2019s banner on your site. The amount paid is usually higher than the pay per impression scheme. A high traffic site will probably enjoy a higher click rate than a lower traffic site although you will probably get better results if your banners are carefully selected to suit the target audience of your site. You can show ad banners above the fold, between posts to get maximum CTR. Note: If you want to join CPC ad network, try Google Adsense, Chitika, BidVertiser etc. You might be interested in reading the following articles: Chitika Ads Reviews \u2013 Earning & Payout MethodsBidvertiser Reviews \u2013 Earning & Payout MethodsEdit 1 - Chitika has been discontinued. In-Text Advertising \u2013 In-text adverting networks like Infolinks will place sponsored links inside your text. These links come with a double underline or dashed underline to differentiate them from normal links, and once the user rolls the mouse over the link the advertising will pop. Should the user click on it the site owner will make some money. Also Read: Infolinks Ads Reviews \u2013 Why Should You Go For It? 2) Join an Affiliate Program Affiliate Marketing is another efficient way to make money. This is a proven way of monetizing a blog and almost all bloggers start out this way. All you need to do is join an Affiliate program like ShareASale or vCommission and market their products and services on your site. This works on CPL and CPS basis. CPL is Cost Per Lead (Lead can be anything whether any visitor watches promoted videos, signs up to the merchant, complete one survey etc). CPS is Cost Per Sale (Whenever your visitor makes a purchase you will receive a commission). Though it is difficult to get conversion but once you promote any sale you get high commission.

They do not advertise or sell any advertise products on their blog. They build an email list by collecting the email address of their visitors and readers and enable them to come up with a solid list of prospective buyers for whichever product you are promoting. You can build and manage list using MailChimp or Aweber. Once you have a large list you can send promotional emails to your email list and make money. But never bombard your readers with lots of emails. Send 1-2 weekly mail with offers you need to provide them with a link to a product or service you are selling. Note: You can use OptinMonster to collect emails from your visitors to turn them into subscribers. 4) Selling ad spaces on your website You can also sell ad spaces from your website in order to make money. You can always find advertisers under your website niche who are willing to promote their product on your website and in return pay you. You can either reach out to the other advertisers directly or you can make use of networking sites like BuySellAds and connect with the potential marketers. You can create a separate page where you can mention about advertising space that you can provide along with charges that you want in return. E.g. Start with an Introduction about you and your website what is it all about. Also, mention your website stats such as monthly visits and page views and provide sufficient information to advertisers. Then, at last, you can mention about ad spaces that are available on your website such as \u2013 728*90 \u2014 Header \u2013 $$$ 468*60 \u2014 Below Post Title \u2013 $$$ 300*250 \u2013 Sidebar \u2013 $$$ 5) Selling your own products You can always join an affiliate program and sell merchants\u2019 products and services. But it will be good if you start selling your own products. It is more profitable and can help you to make money. If your website is about SEO or WordPress or Affiliate Marketing then you can create a \u201cHow To\u201d e-book and sell it online through your website. Similarly, if your website is about cooking, create a cooking e-book. You can also sell physical products from your website. You just need to configure PayPal or any payment gateway to charge the fee for your products and services. 6) RSS Feed Ads Website owners have started to find ways to monetize new content distribution channel such as RSS technology. FeedBurner already has its own publisher network, and you can sign-up to start money by displaying CPM based advertising on your feed footer. Bidvertiser recently introduced an RSS feed ad option as well, with a PPC scheme. 7) Offering services to your readers: Some of the services which most bloggers can offer to make money include \u2013 article writing, SEO services, blog designing, WordPress installation and much more. If you have creative writing skills then you can start making e-books for other people at high rates. 8) Related posts Selling related posts is a relatively new way of earning money. Instead of inter-linking your own related blog posts, you can link to paid posts. You can use a plugin such as Shareaholic which combines your own related posts with paid ones. Popular related post advertising companies are Disqus, Outbrain, Taboola etc. 9) Start a Membership Program: A membership program implies a paid forum where special contents are made available only for the members. You can set reasonable charges to let your visitors join as members to your forum and then provide additional facilities and services to them in return. 10) Paid Surveys and Polls There are many companies that will help you to make money to run a small survey or poll on your website. You can sign up with them, and select the kind of polls that you want to run your site. Most of these services operate under a CPM model. An example of such service is Vizu Answers. 11) Writing Paid Reviews: There are many companies who would readily send you free products for a review. You can write a review on their product or service and in return, those companies would pay you a decent sum to get their free product reviewed. You can also write sponsored posts on your website. It is somewhat similar to writing paid reviews but instead of writing a review, you need to use the name of their product in your post. 12) Creating a conference around the website If your website takes off and becomes an authority on its niche, you could create a conference around it. Depending on the size of your audience, the event could attract thousands of people, and you could make money directly from conference passes and sponsors. 13) Donations It may look weird but placing a \u201cDonate\u201d link or button on a website can be an efficient way to earn money, especially if your blog is a niche where readers learn and gain value from your content. There are many plugins available that enables you to insert a customized message at the bottom of each article, asking the readers to chip in for a beer or coffee. 14) Education programs Education is one of the biggest industries in the world. People are willing to pay for someone or something that will teach them and give them knowledge. You can create an educational program related to the niche of your website. It will be a very profitable job and can earn you handsome income. 15) Sell Your Website If you have tried all the possible ways to make money from your website but are not able to get success with it, you can sell your website. You can use Flippa, We Buy Websites, FEinternational etc to bid and sell your website. Keep in mind that they most used parameters to determine the value of a website is the monthly revenue that it generates, multiplied by a certain number. So, the main problem with selling your site is deciding when to do it. If you sell it too soon, you might be earning less. If you sell it too late, you may receive less money than you like. The ideal situation is to sell when your website\u2019s income stabilizes for a few months. Source: Top 15 Ways To Make Money From Your Website ",

            "answer_text": "How long have you been writing your a Blog? I'm guessing that you have Niche? How long you've been writing and If you've got an audience. the first thing is to concentrate on getting an audience the more people you have reading your blog the more likely you can start making money. Just for the sake of argument, let me assume that you're in the very beginning stages of beginning of blogging. The most important thing for you to start out doing is writing good content every day. if you're writing good content something that people want to read people will come to your website will come to your blog will find friends that would be interested in the content and send your articles to them. Secondly make sure that you're finding your voice, a way that you write and not like other writers. it's okay to emulate some of your favorite authors or bloggers, but find your voice the way you write make it natural and make it flow. If you\u2019re quirky or funny or straight lace, keep it that way. Speak to them and not at them. Once you have an audience then start finding offers from ClickBank, CPA offers, JVzoo, Peerfly, and other affiliate marketing advertisers. The one thing you want to remember is if you are trying to offer somebody something a product make sure that you believe in it, make sure that you know what it is. you want to give solid advice you want to sell something that you yourself would buy and use. Not just out to make a quick buck. if you offer a crappy product you're going to lose your audience. You want to be a voice that people can trust and like I said not out to make just a quick buck. Let's say for example that you're blogging about fishing. look for Affiliates like Bass Pro Shop, Outdoor fishing, Columbia Sportswear, and other sporting for fishing sites. usually at the very bottom is something called an affiliate program. sign up for their affiliate programs, then you can start promoting their merchandise in your blog. basically linking their site on your site. Example if you're trying to promote the new Offshore Angler High tide spinning reel, from Bass Pro Shop. You're going to want to do a review for it your take on it how you think it works, looks, feels, and how it compares to other similar reels. For other reviews you don't know so much about it do your research. Then you would link that reel to your site so when somebody wants to buy it or is just interested in it it'll take him/her straight to their site and you are the earn a commission if they buy it. I'm sorry this is so long I didn't actually mean it to be this long I'm just trying to give up detailed information so that you understand. And again, I don't mean to assume that you don't already know all this it's just me passing on the information I know, to you. The last thing you should do is go to YouTube they have tons of information for people who have started blogs are doing blogs and you can find a lot of great content and information on how they started their blogs. I hope this helps and if you have any questions I'm sure you can get a hold of me if you need to. Good luck ! ",

            "answer_text": " So you started your blog, applied for adsense, made some 'quality' articles, and started dreaming about earning piles of money in a jiffy, eh? At least it happened with me when i stepped foot in this arena, I thought it would be easy, I mean I had some 900 facebook friends, and I was a college topper in mathematics, so I could easily make out, a minimum of 900 pageviews a day ain't bad a start at all. IT DID NOT WORK OUT. Now in this article, I won't be telling you how to increase your pageviews or how to design your website well, I'll focus this article on the top 3 earning sources which pay you the maximum for the minimum number of hits. So the article consists of 3 basic sources of earning: 1.link shortening 2.Ads 3.Affiliate marketing 1. Link shortening:  Link shortening is by far the best and the easiest way to earn money for you do not even need to have a website for earning money using this thing. Now there are hundreds of link shortening websites available on the internet and I have used them all, one day or the other, so I kind of know their payout rates, and on the basis of that, I have come to a conclusion that linkshrink is the best among all. Their payout rate is just $5 and considering all the factors (country from which the traffic is coming from etc) , you can easily earn not less than $2.5 per 1000 views, which is astonishing because you earn very less( some $0.3 from shortest ). Watch the video to know about the payout rates linkshrink offers The interface is very user friendly, plus there are other options for earning money like pop unders as well, So if you want a link shortening service for your website, you can definitely go for linkshrink. Sign up for linkshrink from HERE 2. Ads:  Getting Adsense approval is a fairly difficult task especially when you are new, let alone the restrictions Google implies on you, So to save myself from all this hassle, I opted for two different ad servers, with lesser minimum payout, and somewhat equal amount of money as one could get from Adsense A: Clicksor B:Bidvertiser ALSO READ: 5 vital steps to kickstart your blog 3.Affiliate Marketing:  You do not need any traffic at all when it comes to affiliate marketing, even if you could convince someone personally to buy anything, you are good to go. Flipkart and Amazon are by far the best affiliations you could possibly go for. Affiliate marketing is an altogether different approach of earning money online as it focuses on the number of sales generated through your website, not the amount of clicks, so consider someone buying an Ipod from your blog or website and the commission is 4%,say, So you straightaway earn $4 if it is of $100, easy enough right? ALSO READ:Know this before starting a blog So these are the top 3 techniques by which you could kickstart your earnings from the get go. ",

People \"blog\" for different reasons; some just want to have a great public space on which to share stories and photos about their daily lives and experiences, or any hobbies they might have, and to interact with like minded people. Others do it because they want to help others, and possibly earn a little money on the side while doing it.

Optimize your blog posts for the keywords you picked for your niche. This will help your blog posts to rise to the top of the SERP's. Write unique content. Unique content is king in Google's eyes!

If not, do not waste your time. What do I mean? I mean it is TIME, ACTION CONSISTENTLY AND WORK with no pay for maybe up to 6 mo. or a year until something makes money for you. Maybe five years if you just read the money articles. Keep Reading for TRUTH! I tell you what you need to do!How do you build a following? They don't mention this either.

            "answer_text": "Are you just starting your blog and thinking that your readership is too limited to monetize your blog? I disagree. I disagree. From the first day I began to publish my blog and I think it was worth every second of the time I spent there. I will be 100% frank before you all believe I hit six figures for my first year of blogging: I haven't profited enough to break even my first year. Professional blogs are not free \u2014 domain fees and hosting fees are required. These are not huge costs of only $10 a month, which is considerably less than one year's tuition.  3 Ways to Monetize A Little Blog. 1. Join Low Readership Qualifications Programs. I strongly recommend that all new bloggers sign up as soon as you register for the Amazon affiliate program as well as Google Adsense. See the current rules for both programs to see what the new requirements are, but I was able to join them in a month or so from the start of my blog. You probably won't make a lot for your first year, but that will help you get used to putting ads in your sidebars and putting affiliate links in your blogs. It will also make the readers acquainted with them. I've heard from other bloggers who have waited for attention, but bloggers in many niches have to pay more for their time without them\u2013and trust me, a lot of time goes into writing a blog. 2. Use reference links for You Love businesses. I used item reward programs to encourage the tight budget of my family for years, and I knew about referral rewards before I started blogging. Once I started up and running the site, I put in my sidebar a few advertisements for these companies and connected it to them whenever it was important. Such advertising can usually be found in their comparison banner pages. The trick to sharing links is to share them with businesses which your family has used and enjoyed, or at least those who are highly recommended by people you know, love and trust. When I share a connection to a product that I haven't used personally yet, I mean I have studied (because I'm reading reviews) but haven't yet been using it personally. The sum that you receive per referral may not be much but it can be really accumulated over time\u2013at present, these services account for 15 percent of my income. 3. For eBooks and eCourses You Like, sign-up for partner services. When you find an e-book and an e-course that is directly available on the website of the blogger you want, verify that they have an affiliate program and you are entitled to a 50 percent discount if someone buys it from the connection on your page. Typically, these services don't need a certain number of unique monthly visitors to make them fit for new and small blogs. ",

            "answer_text": "To keep it really simple and basic, there are a few ways you can earn money through blogging.   Affiliates - These are companies including Amazon that pay you to promote their website and or their products. You may get paid per purchase, per click or per coupon print depending on the offer. Some of these groups do have a minimum payout amount so you might need to earn $50 or a $100 with their organization before you get your first payment.  Advertising - You can run ads on your site either from ad networks like Google Adsense, include ads for affiliate offers or even charge for advertising space that you might sell on your own (like to local businesses. Some of these ads might pay per view and others will be per click and the organization may also have a minimum amount you have to earn to get paid.   Sponsored articles or posts - These are posts you write about a client, topic or product in exchange for an agreed upon amount. The amount that you can charge will depend on your niche, traffic and your social media following.    Paid social media - If you've been able to develop your social media following, you may be able to monetize by advertising to them. Many bloggers and marketers earn regular incomes through paid tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram posts or by hosting Twitter parties.    Most bloggers do a combination of all of the above, and depending on your audience and your niche you'll probably do some more than others at different points in your blogging. If your new, you may need to start out with ads and affiliate offers and work your way from there.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to earn money while blogging but two of the most popular ways are by affiliate marketing and showing ads on your site. And the most popular programs for these two ways are Amazon affiliates and Adsense. Amazon affiliate allows you to show products from Amazon on your blog and if someone buys those products, you get a commission. It ranges from 3.5% to 8% depending on the product category.Adsense by Google allows you to shows ads on your site, which pays you when someone clicks on those. Some ads also pay you just for views. The pay per click (PPC) depends on the niche you are in, for example Insurance ads when clicked may pay more than ads on gardening tools.For both these programs, you need to apply and only when approved and you reach a threshold, you get paid. It is $100 in both cases. For applying, you need to have a blog already as you need to give site address in the form. It is easier to get approved by Amazon affiliates and earning is also easy as compared to Adsense. For Adsense, you need huge traffic and more and more people nowadays are ad-blind, which means they simply ignore ads and don\u2019t click on them. Better start an Amazon affiliate site and you can start making money from your 3rd month onward. The steps that you need to follow are, Research a niche (Example, Running shoes)Pick long tail keywords (Like best running shoes for people with ankle pain)Write a minimum 1000 words articles on those keywordsPublish your articleGet links to your siteRepeatIt may sound easy but its not that you just go out, do these and get earning but by following a system, u can easily make at least 100$ per month. Once your site gains traction, you can flip(sell) it too. Don\u2019t wait and just keep reading about stuff without taking action, start work and start earning. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I could get rich. It takes years to gather an audience. First find a topic that is not talked about (Thats impossible) so find a way to make something talked about better on your site.  There are ads (like google adsense), then go to companies seeking ads that are targeted and many times you can cut out middle men (google). You can have people register for your blog and once you have a large list of email addresses, sell those to a company. Give reviews on products and get advertisements from that company, you can even link to those products and arrange a code that gives readers of your blog maybe a slight discount but also give you maybe 5% of the products. (5% of thousand is 50$ x 10 customers isn't great but it something and if you get it from one post 500$ is ok) There are ways to drive traffic to your blog. For instance Google Keywords (Think thats the name) will send you an email every site a keyword is mentioned (Say keywords are health, fitness) go and leave a message in comments and link to your blog. Idea is link will hopefully have people go to your blog and read a post even better if they subscribe. Those are a few ways but you need to spend many hours on the web looking up other ways. See which ways work for other people. I think most people have worked on many different routes, such as a ebook or product you can sell on your website.  Turn your ebook into a audiobook. Make your blog posts into videos on YouTube and link back to your blog also get a little bit of revenue from YouTube. Put some pictures on Pintrest with those pictures pointing to your blog. Basically point everything at your blog, have a big mesh with everything pointing at everything. EDIT: For driving traffic to your blog I should also mention a long term/natural solution of SEO. For quick but not necessarily long term, stumbleupon, reddit, Pinterest. A large percentage of bloggers will also not soley focus on a blog but also have a YouTube channel (Even if only 2 videos) also a Facebook page and sometimes LinkedIn. Many people will sell things on a blog. I traded time recommending/checking things on someone elses blog, He had Bulking Diet and Home - Cutting Diets and he would sell a meal plan that would help with proper weight or healthy eating. He also used affiliate marketing so those that marketed his product and sold it for him would get something like 50% of what he got. Lots of people/companies do affiliate marketing because it can drastically increase sales and likely reach audiences that would never be reached. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s definitely possible to do it, which is an important first step. Knowing exactly how you want to make money is going to go hand in hand with what sort of blog you\u2019re looking at creating. Before you jump in, do a lot of research and have a plan. There is a great deal of literature out there on the subject, even whole blogs that make money by publishing articles instructing would-be bloggers on how to follow suit. There are a lot of schools of thought on this subject, but I\u2019ll break down three big ones. Affiliate MarketingThis model involves dealing with vendors either directly or indirectly. Amazon is by far and away one of the most common clients Affiliate sites will use, because it\u2019s incredibly easy. A Blog will have, for example, a list of items, an article or a single link that will point readers to specific items that the Blogger has chosen beforehand. Every purchase made through these links will yield the Blogger a small portion of the profits. It is also possible to create your own independent Affiliate store by purchasing products up-front and effectively running your own inventory. This can be a little involved and requires an upfront investment, hence the popularity of convenient arrangements as with Amazon. Private agreements can also be reached with smaller boutique clients. A method related to this is selling reviews, and many affiliate sites will use a product reviews to introduce links, whether they are for hotels, shoes or cooking supplies.Ad-BasedMany Blogs will have banner or sidebar ads. Bloggers employ these in the hopes that visitors to the site will click the ads. Every ad click is worth money. The rate is largely dependent on the site\u2019s traffic, the quality of the ads and a number of other factors. Facebook is a great example of using targeted ads to generate revenue, and while the ads on many sites are not using as sophisticated an algorithm, the principle remains the same. Even renting space for ads can yield a degree of profit, however, much of this is again determined by site traffic and overall engagement. A blog with low engagement will see pennies per click whereas a major publication running, for example, liquor ads, is likely receiving a significantly larger fee based on rental of space.FreelancingThis method is a less direct than the previous two, and requires a different skill set. There are a great deal of outlets that pay writers, from content mills to major publications. A blog focused on Freelancing is using the blog itself as a springboard to obtain these contracts, which can evolve into full-time positions or simply lucrative one-time contracts. The blog seeks to establish the writer as a trusted expert, while the blogger makes efforts to network and create exposure while querying publications. The site then effectively becomes a portfolio unto itself, opening up opportunities to the Blogger as readership and engagement climbs. This in turn yields larger and larger contracts, but also opens the door to consulting on the fields of expertise.Generating profit from a Blog is certainly a difficult pursuit, but it can be done in as little as a few months, given the proper niche and quality content. The key is, again, to do your research and pick a topic you\u2019re passionate for. Targeted content is both easier to manage and enables you to cultivate authority on a given subject. The market is incredibly saturated with those that see it as a quick buck, and competition is fierce, but it Blogging is most definitely something you can make money from. ",

            "answer_text": "I am just pasting my reply again here which I answered to a similar question. Yes its no strange these days to make money from blog, its 100% reality and very easily possible. It\u2019s a simple concept where one can attract thousand and millions of people on his/her blog through quality content on specific area of interest which may be travel, health, tech, automobile, love, spirituality or any thing you can think of under the sun. Once the blog has significantly good number of visitors on regular basis it may be monetized through different ways. You can compare it with an event. Let\u2019s assume you organize an event, where you invite audience free of cost. You then go to different sponsors to advertise in the event by committing them that you will gather atleast x number of people. These sponsor may be a company, a retail shop or any business related to the audience profile of the event. Now with a hope that these x number of visitors will see their banner or ad or video clip in the event and some of them may be their potential customer, these companies pay to advertise in the event and that\u2019s how event organizer earns. Similarly in a blog, writer writes on a particular topic and tries to attract interested like minded people and through new blog post every day, writer tries to get these people visit their blog on regular basis and uses the same audience to monetize the blog. There are different ways how a blogger makes money, Publishing ad on the blog visible to reader through google ad senseDirect adAffiliate marketing, where blogger persuades reader to visit particular website and buy their product and in return they earn some commission on every sale.Selling books, ebook, software or any related product on the blogProduct reviews/Sponsored post, where blogger gets paid to write good reviews about products. There are multiple benefits of this where blogger gets to use the product free of cost like a software or mobile, and then gets paid to write about it.There are so many bloggers who do blogging in part time and earn good money, whereas there are many bloggers from whom blogging is their bread and butter. Some blogger even earn in millions and billions through their exceptional subject knowledge, writing skill, online marketing skills, and ability to engage audience on regular basis. However, like any business, even in blogging not everyone gets successful to make money, as it seems easy, but actually requires enormous skills and focus to start blogging and be consistent to it with a quality content. The money will come directly to the linked bank account or paypal account. I hope that answers your query. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a really great question... And to give you the perfect answer, we have take a step back and talk for a few seconds about... Animals.  What do all animals have in common? Even insects and other living things? It's a head.  The head is how they sense the world, know what to do next, what dangers to escape, and how to thrive in life. So, then, what is the purpose of your blog? Your blog is your head.  Your blog is your eyes, it allows you to see your market.Your blog is your ears, it allows you to hear your market.Your blog is your mouth, it allows you to speak to your market.Your blog is your brain, it allows you to think and share ideas with your market. And, with this fundamental understanding, I can present to you the SSOP method to making money using your blog, successfully. 1. Shotgun Approach: Publish, Publish, Publish. When you first begin your blog, you don't really know what will work. You don't know the keys to success.  So, the first step is to find the popular topics and keywords in your niche, and to write articles about them, well-researched solid articles.  Goal: Publish 10 articles on the 10 most important topics / keywords in your market. 2. Sniper Mentality: Pick the winners! After publishing those 10 articles, pay attention to your analytics.  Some of those articles will do MUCH better than others... Why? For 2 reasons: The first is -- We live in a 90%-10% world, where 90% of what we try doesn't get great results, but 10% is AMAZING. You're searching that 10%!  Second is -- Humans are not robots. Based on your writing style, you will naturally attract a different type of person than someone else with a different style of writing. Pay attention, because those are YOUR PEOPLE.  Then, When you find the article that did much better than the rest, go into Sniper mode! Focus on that topic / theme / keyword and write 10 articles related to it... Example, if the topic that is successful is: How to write an ebook, you can simply begin to write articles on -- Choosing the right cover for your ebook, which software is best for writing an ebook quickly, how to outline your ebook for maximum clarity, the secret tool you can use to choose your eBook title, the perfect length for your ebook, how to write the perfect introduction that captivates the reader, the difference between writing a How To book and a Story. Etc etc The choices are unlimited! And your Audience will thank you for it! Goal: Write 10 new articles with topics related to the successful topic from Step 1. 3. Open to Feedback: Listen to your blog readers.  If there is ONE thing you should never forget in each and every article you write, it is this: Ask for feedback, encourage comments, give an incentive for people to engage and participate. Why? Because each words someone in your niche writes to you is worth more than gold and diamonds!  They are telling you what they want! They're giving you the clues to success! So listen, and as Ram Das said: \"The quieter you become, the more you can hear\"  Goal for this step: Collect on a document 10 comments from 10 different blog readers. 4. Product Creation: This is how the monetization happens! Do you know the easiest way to sell something? It's to give the person exactly what they've asked for. To provide them with exactly what they want. To solve the exact problems they need.  The problem is, most people are too busy trying to push their own thoughts onto the world, trying to force out what they think people should want, they don't take the time to do a simple thing such as: Listen. Understand. Then fulfill people's wants and needs.  But NOT you. You're reading this. You already know what to do. So what to do in this step? Goal: Analyze the 10 comments you've collected previously, and create a small product that solves the most common question or problem people told you about. That's it. You've followed the SSOP method to create the first passive stream of income onto your blog that you will put on sales right on the sidebar. What to do next? Easy! Repeat the process!  Shotgun. Snipe. Open Feedback. Product Creation. SSOP. Create a small Product\u2026 2 small products. Then 3, then 4, then 5. And you will earn money with your blog giving people exactly what they want.  You've followed the best strategy to create a blog that helps people, that gives you freedom, where you create value and receive value, so that you can get financial independence and live the life you want. I'm happy for you. Because this is really what I'm about. \u2014 Did You Like This Answer?, Click Here To Find Even Better Content In My Quora Profile. ",

To be homest with you, wheneber I refer someone to it I receive a commission, but it could be a great place to start if you are looking to start a new blog. I've read above someone mentioned the Empower Network, which are in my opinion are pioneers of the viral blogging system and have over 130,000 members today and have excellent training courses. Basically, the way these network work is that you pay a monthly fee for your EN blog or LSN blog (they both use the same Wordpress viral blogging platform, $25 for EN and $30 for LSN), then you start blogging. Some people do a post a day, others once a week, the more the better. As more and more people start blogging, the domain name will start to rank. It's like owning a piece of a big website like facebook, for which millions of people (in this case, thousands) contribute everyday, and renting how a part of it every month. You can start writing about tech, then eventually hire new people to write on specific topics through their own blogging platform ",

            "answer_text": "Hi - let\u2019s work backward! If you want a money-making blog, you need to sell something. To sell something, you need people who read your blog to get enough benefit from your content that they are willing to part ways with their money to by the products you\u2019re offering. That usually works when the product either entertains or solves a problem. So to start a money-making blog, you need to decide what subject you can write about that solves the problems people have or provides a useful or educational form of entertainment. That subject is referred to as your \u201cniche\u201d. It might be golfing or juggling or campers or cameras, etc. Once you decide on your niche, you can make money in various ways, but note that it does take work. You need to write a lot of good quality content and keep posting regularly. Many people start off with affiliate marketing to make money, but you can also place ads on your site or sell physical or digital products. What it takes to actually start the blog is web hosting (usually WordPress works best), and your domain name (what your website address is), some content to start with, and it\u2019s a really good idea to have an email service provider (for building an email list of subscribers) Here\u2019s some info on getting started with your blog (hosting an email list, too), plus an example of how to sell digitals products called ebooks. I hope this helps answer your question! ",

            "answer_text": "So there are several ways one can make money by starting a blog. In the video below, I share 7 different strategies that you can incorporate in order to build an income through blogging.  However, I do want to ask this one question\u2026 Out of all of the business models out there, why choose to blog? Because understand that to be a successful blogger, you have to be a great content creator and marketer. Meaning that you need to be able to create top quality articles with great writing, images, search engine optimization (SEO), etc. in order to get ranked and found. Plus, you need to really market your blog posts on other platforms. I see too many people get into blogging because they think it\u2019s the best way to earn money online. But it\u2019s challenging (especially if you don\u2019t like to write) and it takes a lot of work without getting paid for a long time. Most people aren\u2019t writers but then force themselves to when they start a blog and then quit really quickly because they realized they actually don\u2019t like writing and creating content. And that\u2019s AFTER they spend money to start their blog. So before launching your website/blog, my suggestion is to write 15\u201320 high-quality articles over the next 30 days or so in the specific niche that you\u2019d create your blog around. Research how to rank on with SEO and understand what it truly takes to be a successful blogger. Then, if you find out you don\u2019t like writing or it\u2019s painful, then you\u2019ve just saved yourself a whole lot of time and money. If blogging isn\u2019t for you, definitely look into other ways to earn money online which I share in this video\u2026  Best of luck in your blogging/business journey, Dan Lu ",

            "answer_text": "My blog actually just wrote a post on this. I think this could help a lot.  Creating a blog has become one of the most popular tasks in 2020 (especially in quarantine) and it\u2019s now easier than it ever was before. If you\u2019re thinking about entering the world of blogging, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re confused and have a lot of questions. Starting a blog can seem like a daunting task; it requires thorough research and it can be difficult to know where to begin. No need to fear\u2013 here\u2019s a simple guide on how to create the blog you\u2019ve dreamt of creating. Getting Started Decide What You Want to Blog About To create your blog, you need to figure out what type of content you want to publish. You may have this figured out already, but don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t. Start by thinking about what interests you most and imagine ways to write about that. Many sites will recommend finding a \u201cniche\u201d interest area for your blog to be about, but that\u2019s not required and your blog doesn\u2019t have to be super niche. Take our blog for example. We\u2019re an entrepreneurship blog, yet we cover topics such as marketing, business, and lifestyle. The most important aspect to keep in mind is that your blog is your own\u2013 use your voice to make it unique. Pick a Blogging Platform To create content, you need somewhere to post your work. There are a plethora of platforms to choose from, yet WordPress is one of the top platforms bloggers are using today. WordPress is easy to use, super user-friendly and has many free plug-ins that will help your blog obtain traffic. WordPress can seem a bit confusing at first, yet check out their tutorial or this beginners\u2019 guide on YouTube by Tyler Moore.  Find a Domain Name This part can be a little tricky because you\u2019ll need to find a unique domain name that still speaks to your blog\u2019s brand. Domain names are usually short, not super wordy, and are something that audiences will remember. Click here for some domain name inspiration. Remember, this name is your brand and it defines who you are. Use a Web Hosting Account Web hosting allows your blog to be visible on the internet, which is required if you\u2019re looking to obtain page traffic. The hosting companies will literally \u201chost\u201d your blog on the internet, and users will then be able to access your content. The most popular hosting site at the moment that is compatible with WordPress is BlueHost. BlueHost has a monthly cost that varies between the type of package, yet the small investment will be worth it if it means your blog is noticeable. Other hosting platforms include DreamHost and HostGator, which Ryan Robinson outlines in his guide to starting a blog. Design Your Blog The way your blog looks is perhaps the most crucial step to effectively creating your blog. We say not to judge a book by its cover, but let\u2019s be real, we all do. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best-written content on your blog, because if it doesn\u2019t look appealing, then no one will read it. You need to engage your audience as soon as they visit your page with enticing graphics and a pleasing color scheme. WordPress has a bunch of free themes to choose from, yet if you\u2019re looking for something more unique, try shopping at Etsy for some reasonably priced themes.  Start Writing Blog Posts Your blog wouldn\u2019t be a blog if you didn\u2019t have any content! Once you get all the basics set up, start writing immediately. You can go back and edit the design, alter your domain name, or work on your blog\u2019s social media marketing strategy later. For now, just start uploading some content. Keep in mind that your articles don\u2019t have to be masterpieces; write about topics that interest you and use your own, conversational voice to get your creative juices flowing. Realize it\u2019s an Investment Creating a blog takes a great deal of time and dedication. It\u2019s an investment in your lifestyle and your finances. For your blog to be successful, you will need to put some amount of money into it, whether it be signing up for a host or picking a custom theme. You\u2019ll also need to dedicate some time to working on your blog and improving it as you go along. However, this investment will be so worth it once you see it pay off in the end. Earning Money  Many people opt to start blogs because they know of the financial benefits it can provide. A lot of people will say that you shouldn\u2019t be in it for the money, but it\u2019s okay if earning a profit is one of your goals. Just be sure that you\u2019re not only in it for the money, but also personal fulfillment purposes. I came across this young blogging entrepreneur, By Sophia Lee, who began her blog about a year ago. This past May she was able to make over $43,000 in that month just from her blog. Unbelievable, right? But if she can do it, so can you. Here are some ways you can earn money fast through your blog: Use advertisements Advertisements are a big source of revenue for many bloggers. You can either sell ad placements to companies or use programs such as Google AdSense or MediaVine. If you\u2019re just starting, try using Google Ad Sense and once you gain more traffic you can start looking into other options. Utilize Pinterest You may think social media is the game changer to increasing your blog traffic, and while that is true, it\u2019s not the social media you\u2019re thinking. Facebook and Instagram are helpful in some ways, yet growth on these platforms is slow. Pinterest is on the rise in the world of blogging because it generates large amounts of traffic in a more efficient manner compared to other social media. Sophia Lee made a YouTube video outlining her path to a successful blog and one of the most important things she emphasized was using Pinterest to gain traffic to your page. This was the only social media she used and today her Pinterest page has over 10 million monthly viewers. All the traffic brought to her page through Pinterest made her more attractive to advertisers and affiliate marketers. Follow this guide on how to use Pinterest to gain traffic to your blog.  Embrace SEO Search engine optimization is a tool you can use to increase the visibility of your blog, thus gaining more traffic. WordPress offers the plug-in Yoast which helps you make sure your blog post is SEO-certified; it essentially assists you in making your blog more attractive. To learn how to use SEO, check out our article, or click here for our free SEO book. Write for Your Audience Let\u2019s be real: your blog is not about you. As harsh as it may sound, your audience doesn\u2019t care about you or your experiences; they only care about themselves. People read blogs to improve themselves and apply the lessons you\u2019ve learned to their lives. Therefore, you need to create content about your audience. Keeping the audience in mind is such a critical aspect of blogging, business, public relations, marketing, etc. You need to write something that will appeal to them, and once you start to frame your content that way, more and more people will engage with your blog. For instance, don\u2019t title your article \u201cHow I started my Blog,\u201d but rather title it \u201cHow You Can Start Your Blog.\u201d Create Courses for Purchase You may want to consider creating and selling educational courses related to your blog once you gain enough traffic. Maybe you want to create an in-depth guide on how to use influencer marketing or how to turn your start-up idea into a business. Whatever it may be, audiences who come across your blog are looking to get something of value, and if you can provide that, they\u2019ll be willing to pay.  How to Create a Blog: Stick to It Starting a blog can be challenging, frustrating, and you may not achieve success right away. It may just feel easier to give up, but don\u2019t do it. You\u2019ve put in all this effort already, so why throw that all away? When you feel like giving up, push through that feeling, and keep going. Commit to making your blog the best it can be. Set aside time each day to work on your blog, even if it\u2019s just for an hour or two. Set deadlines for yourself and create a blogging calendar to make sure you update your blog frequently. When all else fails, keep trying. KEY TAKEAWAYS Starting a blog can seem like a difficult task, but the above tips can help you get your blog idea off the ground and running. If you\u2019re wondering how to create a blog, nothing is holding you back from doing it, so go for it. Yes, it can be a frustrating and time-consuming process, but remember why you started it in the first place. If you get what you want in the end, whether it\u2019s monetary or personal gain, it\u2019ll be 100 percent worth it. Keep in mind that this is your image, business, and your brand. Stay true to you and be genuine when you upload content to be attractive to an audience. Know that you can create a fantastic blog and that you are more than capable of achieving success. ",

If you want to get started on creating a blog then you first have to choose a niche in which you will be creating your blog around. It is important that the niche you choose is a profitable niche or you won't be making any money and you will waste your time. After that, you want to choose a hosting company in which you will be hosting your blog. From that point on you will have to start creating a lot of articles that are optimized for SEO. Besides SEO you will have to focus on getting backlinks to be able to rank higher and you will have to get traffic from other sources besides Google in the beginning. The reason for this is that it takes a while before Google actually start ranking your website in the first page. This means that you won't be seeing any traffic in the first couple of months after you create articles. That is why i recommend you create around 30 articles and then focus on another platform like Youtube or Pinterest. If you want a step by step guide i recommend you read these articles that explain it very well.

These can have a role at some point, but they mainly undermine your ability to monetize your blog more effectively.  Source: How to Really Monetize a Blog (Easy 1-2-3 Blog Monetization Strategy) Some problems with this model: The rise of ad blockers mean a lot of your traffic won\u2019t see the ads anyway.People now normally switch devices in the course of the purchase process, which most affiliate programs are unable to track - so you\u2019ll only get credit for a proportion of sales you generate.Most sites following this model, thanks to all the links and ads they incorporate to try to earn something, have high bounce-back rates to the SERPs, damaging listings and making it hard to attract traffic long-term.The low incomes such blogs receive make it generally impossible to scale up traffic and income flows through advertising.In contrast, the model you need is shown here:  Your sole focus should instead be: Firstly on using your blog to collect leads for your email list (here are ten ways to do just that).Secondly on creating and selling your own products to them (and in so doing, building your own customer list who are likely to purchase from your repeatedly).This type of model far exceeds any relatively small amounts you might earn through ads and affiliate links (here\u2019s another Quora answer that proves just how significant the difference in income levels can be). More detail on how to put the above into practice can be found in the following post: How to Really Monetize a Blog (Easy 1-2-3 Blog Monetization Strategy) ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s get to the practical side and talk about the what might work the best. While you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m making an assumption that you\u2019re a beginner, or you wish to earn a steady income through blogging or content marketing. At the same time, if you\u2019re expecting a secret tip to earn a million dollar, then I\u2019m afraid I might disappoint you - because I\u2019ll only talk about gradual, realistic growth. Why do people choose blogging as an option for earning? The question makes sense, right? The thing is, we really need to clear up myths. Blogging won\u2019t earn you instantly. Most people highlight the idea that you can create a recurring stream within a couple of weeks. They\u2019re wrong.It\u2019s not as easy as it appears to be. I know they say you just need to sit in front of the computer and type. But, you won\u2019t get it until you do it.Most outcomes are huge. They show you $$$ symbols, make things looks easy, say you won\u2019t mention the mess that\u2019s involved - still, you\u2019d need to put in efforts equivalent to a real world job.Did I break some hopes? I hope not. While I\u2019ve clearly mentioned some details why people look upon blogging as ray of hope (actually, there\u2019s a lot more to it) - I simply wish to say that there are multiple ways to earn through blogging. Yet, the earnings can be directly through blogging, or rather be a secondary outcome. Here\u2019s a list of way you can use to earn online 1. Sell products. It would be ideal if you\u2019re already creating certain products by yourself, or maintaining a business that involves selling something. Then, you can use your blog to promote your products on Amazon or other online marketplace like Etsy. 2. Services. While you cannot perform manual work online, such as repair or something, you can provide work that can be done online. Now this includes tons of options such as: Web designingGraphics creationCopywritingProofreadingMusic productionVoiceover\u2026 and several other options. Check out fiverr and other similar sites for inspiration. 3. Enhance your business. Earning through blogging doesn\u2019t mean that you should solely treat it as a primary source of income. In fact, the could be quite odd. Instead, use your blog to start or grow an existing business. For example, you can try the following ideas: Create a list of articles to attract the local audienceExhibit your products or services onlineMarket your products or service within localityA good example could be like starting a tuition class, attracting students to your blog, then gradually convincing them to enrol for your classes. Find what could be relevant in your context. 4. Entertain, and grow Several bloggers start because they\u2019re desperate about becoming popular online. Now, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s the right thing to do. Yet, if you\u2019re a genuine, creative soul and wish to see how blogging can help you earn through you talent or skills, then you can tie it to your personal brand and efforts. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an aspiring stand-up comedian, singer, or dancer - then you first prove your mettle after performing a couple of times, and then develop yourself as a professional and start charging. This might mean that you teach others, entertain them by conducting live shows, start selling your videos, and so on. Merely putting videos on YouTube and expecting a high revenue could be an overrated idea. It\u2019s better to use YouTube as an asset that helps you spread your ideas and craft. 5. Other methods Apart from these, you already know what they internet is flooding with. I\u2019m not sure about these, but you try these if you believe any of this might work for you. Create a BuzzFeed kind of site, get traffic, and do AdSense.Create a review site, hyperlink some buttons, sell relevant affiliate products.Create content related to a specific niche, and then promote others\u2019 stuff for money.That\u2019s all, almost. Yet, I would say the potential of earning via blogging depends much on the creativity and how you harness its potential. Blogging is nothing more than a medium to spread your ideas. What matters eventually is what you\u2019re using it for. So ensure that you avoid spending your time and efforts on the wrong things. It\u2019s better to figure out what your strengths and passion are and then doing something that\u2019s related to them. BTW here\u2019s a comprehensive infographic from Blog Tyrant.

            "answer_text": "Blog and Website are almost the same. Blogs are a type of website. The only difference is that blogs have frequently updated content and websites tend to be much more static and is organized into pages. Here I Explain How can one Make Money Starting a Website? I also know thousands of other people who are earning money online in their own way with websites, courses, or unique marketing tricks. What we want to know and what the question really is \u201cWhat is the most effective way of earning money through a website?\u201d Your online income takes time to grow. You need to be willing to devote the time and energy required to get your idea off the ground, and you need the grit to stick with it even if your journey is slow when you first start out. 1. GOOGLE ADSENSE If you\u2019ve visited any website, you\u2019ve seen Google ads. These ads are everywhere, and for good reason. Google AdSense is easy to get set up. If you have a website, you can sign up for a free Google AdSense Account. From there, Google will give you a unique code that you will paste onto your website. So they can start displaying relevant advertisements that your audience will find useful. You, on the other hand, will get paid each time someone clicks on that ad. They cut off your pay can vary between $0.50 - $5 per click. It is that easy. Now, you\u2019re ready to earn money. Signup to Google Adsense services and get the revenues from the ads from the users visiting your web page and clicking the ads. 2. AFFILIATE MARKETING  This just goes to show that you can make money with nearly any affiliate company or product if you know your audience and build up enough traffic to create sales. You can start by selling a product that you like and would sincerely recommend. Then, you can endorse the product and promote it on your blog/website so your visitors or readers can click and purchase. By purchasing that product of-of your blog or website, you get a decent amount of cut. 3. SPONSORED ARTICLES Once you do the hard work into building a good traffic to your site and you have a well-engaged community, you can open your site for another blog/website owners to post on your site for money. All you need to do is first do the hardest work in investing time in your blog/website and your community, then establish quality guidelines and criteria for the content and start receiving submissions. For those articles that are actually go live on your blog or website, you can ask for money in return for them to be published. 4.DONATIONS  This one goes for those blogs or websites that don't have tons of monthly visitors but have a strong and engaged community. \"All you need to do is to simply ask your readers to donate\". This way is probably not the way that will make you a millionaire but will for sure help you cover some expenses and support your journey. 5.E-COMMERCE E-Commerce is a way to show the list of products to a person who surf's internet, if he likes the product or service he buys the product and so you earn the money from the products sold. Example: Flipkart is an E-Commerce Site. Sell some products through your website is the most rewarding among all approaches. Dropshipping is really easy to do if you have a website with a good number of visitors. You don\u2019t need to have a logistic or large warehouse of inventory if you do drop shipping. Your only responsibility is to attract more customers to make the purchase with your site. . . . So what is the common factor in all these options, other than the requirement of customers? It's simple, they all take time. Thanks for Reading, If you like Click Upvote! ",

            "answer_text": "Blogging is definitely a long-term \u201cgame\u201d when it comes to making money out of it. It\u2019s not wise to expect any income for the first few months. You may earn a few hundred if your blog is geared towards making money from the first day. If you\u2019re really serious about it and you\u2019re passionate about a certain topic, you can start blogging. It\u2019s easier to grow your blog with one niche than to write about virtually anything. That said, you can always have a multi-niche blog like mine as long as the topics are not too far off. I recommend WordPress as your blogging platform. I\u2019ve tried Blogger and GoDaddy\u2019s website builder in the past but it\u2019s definitely not recommended. Don\u2019t be confused between WordPress[dot]com and WordPress[dot]org. The former is a free platform that is hosted on WordPress\u2019 own server. It\u2019s severely limited and no professional blogger will use it to grow their blog. The latter is also using WordPress but you have to find your own hosting. In both cases, you\u2019re still using WordPress as a CMS (meaning that you\u2019re using it as a website/blog builder). However, hosting of the blog is separate. If you\u2019re under WordPress[dot]com\u2019s hosting, they basically own your blog and put restrictions into plugins and what you can do with it. If you have your own hosting, you can do whatever you want with your blog but it\u2019s a learning curve. I wrote a guide on setting up a self-hosted WordPress blog (a.k.a. WordPress[dot]org) here.

Yes, it is possible to make money with ads on WordPress, but there are also other ways you can monetize your blog content. Here are a few methods that work: 1. Make Money With Affiliate Marketing  Affiliate marketing is when you recommend a product or service to your audience using special tracking links, and then get a referral commission for every time someone buys after clicking your link. A real-life example of affiliate marketing would be when you help a friend open a bank account at your bank branch. Usually, they give you a gift card or a bonus of some sort. Similar to that many products and services online have affiliate programs that you can join. There are affiliate programs available for every industry (niche). If you\u2019re interested in getting started with affiliate marketing, you can start by thinking about the products you already use that your readers may be interested in as well. Then you can see if they have an affiliate program that you can sign up for. You can find a huge list of products to promote from: AmazonCommission JunctionShareASaleOnce you have selected the products to promote, then you can use a WordPress plugin like PrettyLinks to manage your affiliate links. It allows you to quickly insert links into posts, create branded links, auto-replace keywords into links, and even see how each link is performing on your site. Affiliate marketing is the easiest way to make money because you can promote a wide-variety of products. Just about every popular store like Walmart, BestBuy, Amazon, and others have an affiliate program. To learn more, see our beginner\u2019s guide to affiliate marketing and also check out these affiliate marketing tools and plugins which will help you increase your earnings. 2. Display Google AdSense on WordPress  Google Adsense is an easy way to make money from your blog. All you need to do is add a script from Google to your website and start displaying ads. You will get paid for every time a user clicks on the ad. These are called CPC ads. What is CPC? CPC stands for \u201ccost per click.\u201d By displaying CPC ads with Google Adsense, you receive a set fee every time a visitor clicks on an ad. The cost per click is set by the advertiser. (This is in contrast to CPM ads, where you\u2019re paid for ad views instead of clicks. CPM means \u201ccost per thousand impressions,\u201d where M is the roman numeral for 1,000.) Google Adsense is a good way to start earning money online when you are first starting out. You can see our guide on how to monetize a WordPress blog with Google AdSense to get started, and this tutorial on how to optimize your AdSense revenue for more tips. Looking for a Google AdSense alternative? Try Media.net. They also have a large pool of advertisers, and their payouts are good. 3. Use a WordPress Advertising Plugin to Sell Ads Directly  Google AdSense is easy to set up, but the amount of money you can earn is limited. Each ad click earning will vary. Directly selling banner ad space on your website can be more lucrative. Instead of having to rely on an intermediary who takes a cut of the money, you negotiate the price and terms on your own. Above we mentioned the difference between CPC and CPM ads, where you are paid per click or per thousand views. While you could use one of those models for selling banner ads, most bloggers charge a flat rate instead. Charging a flat rate is easier than keeping track of views or clicks. Still, directly selling ads takes more work to manage than using Google AdSense. Instead of just adding a bit of code to your website, you\u2019ll have to negotiate the pricing, come up with an agreement and terms, and take care of administrative work like invoicing. However, using a WordPress ad management plugin can make the process easier. We recommend using AdSanity, it allows you to manage Google AdSense as well as your own ads. To learn more, see our guide on how to sell ads on your WordPress blog. 4. Sell Sponsored Blog Posts Some bloggers aren\u2019t interested in displaying ads to their audience and wonder how to monetize a blog without ads. With ad networks, you lose some control over the content displayed on your site. Some readers will get annoyed or offended by ads, and more and more people are using ad blockers which affects your earning potential. An alternative way to monetize a blog is through sponsorships. A sponsorship works just like it does in sports, TV shows, or other industries. Basically, a company pays you to represent their product, talk about it, and promote it to your readers. To get started, it\u2019s a good idea to put together a one-page media kit that details your traffic stats, social media following, audience demographics, and any other data that will make your site more appealing to advertisers. Then, you can approach companies to negotiate a sponsorship deal. When publishing sponsored posts, it\u2019s crucial to know about the laws in your area about disclosure. For example, in the United States, a blogger who publishes a sponsored post must comply with the FTC\u2019s Endorsement Guides. This includes disclosing whenever a post is sponsored. You can do that by adding a sponsored post prefix to your post title in WordPress. 5. Get Paid to Write Reviews  Similar to sponsored posts, you can also make money by writing paid reviews on your site. This is a slightly different monetization method than a review site with affiliate links, as mentioned above. Instead, you get to try out products related to your niche for free, and even get paid for writing a review. The process for doing this can be similar to getting sponsored posts. You\u2019ll want to review products that are relevant to your niche, that your audience would be interested in. You can approach companies on your own to ask about doing paid reviews. There are also websites like PayPerPost that can help to connect you with businesses who may be interested. 6. Earn Money Online by Flipping Websites  If you know how to build a WordPress website, then you\u2019re way ahead of most people. Sometimes entrepreneurs like to buy already established websites that they can use for their own businesses. If you can build a WordPress blog and start getting traffic to it, then you can sell it and make money for your efforts. This requires knowing the type of websites in demand, and how to price and sell them. There are websites like Flippa that serve as auction sites and brokers for selling websites. 7. Get Public Speaking Gigs as an Influencer  If you are promoting your own brand along with your blog, then over time you will get a decent following establishing you as an influencer in your space. You can utilize this recognition to get some public speaking jobs. Many bloggers make a lot of money by speaking at conferences. Speaking at events whether you are paid or not helps you promote your blog and your personal brand. If you are good at networking and public speaking, then you would be able to find lots of new opportunities on the way. Here are some general tips you need to keep in mind if you want to make money as a paid public speaker. Be an expert in your field. If you don\u2019t have enough knowledge/skills at the moment, then start learning right away.Be consistent \u2013 You need to continuously promote your expertise on the topic through your blogging and social media activities.Let people know that you are available. You can announce on social media or privately reach out to event organizers.You may not find paid public speaking gigs right away. Many successful speakers start their public speaking career from smaller, more casual, and free community events and meetups.Create a Paid Membership Website  If you\u2019re not interested in selling ads or sponsored posts, there are plenty of other ways you can earn money online from your blog. A popular method is by having your audience pay to access certain content or areas of your site. Here are a couple of ways to do that. 8. Create Restricted Members Only Content Your most loyal readers are huge fans and may be willing to pay to read more of your work. You can create a members-only area for them to share more in-depth blog posts, downloads, videos, audio content, and more. Membership sites can be a big time investment since you must continually create premium content for your paying members. But they can be very lucrative because they are recurring revenue (subscriptions). You can easily create a membership site using a WordPress membership plugin. We recommend using MemberPress, it is the most beginner friendly and robust membership plugin for WordPress. We have a complete guide on making a WordPress membership website with step by step instructions to help you get started. 9. Create a Private Forum Another option for creating a paid membership site is to create private forums that users must pay to get access to. Forums are a great way for your audience to get one-on-one advice from you. Other members of the community can also interact and help each other out. While moderating a forum can be a lot of work, a paid forum is a great way to earn recurring revenue from your WordPress site. To get started, you\u2019ll need to set up a forum on your site. Here are our recommended top 5 best forum plugins for WordPress. 10. Create a questions and answers community  Question and answers communities like Stack Exchange and Quora are huge. They help you build an online community that is driven, motivated, and highly engaged. Just like forums, you will have to spend some time building a sizable community. After that, you will be able to monetize user-generated content on your website using advertisements, affiliate ads, and other methods. Popular question and answer websites are able to get direct advertisement and sponsorship deals from advertisers in their industry. This helps them negotiate a much higher rate and extra perks. See our guide on how to start a Questions and Answers website using WordPress. Create a Directory Website With WordPress  Another option for making money online with WordPress is to create a directory or listing website. You can then charge visitors to advertise their listings on your site. Here are a few different directory ideas to get you started. 11. Create a Paid Business Directory Web directories may make you think of the early days of the web before bots started indexing everything automatically, but they\u2019re not completely obsolete. Generic web directories are no longer necessary, but local or niche directories can be extremely useful. Directories might gather reviews of local businesses, share the best podcasts on a given topic, or list the best products in a certain niche. You can easily create a web directory in WordPress following our tutorial. There are also plenty of directory plugins for WordPress you can choose from, many of which allow you to accept payments with submissions. 12. Create a WordPress Job Board With Paid Submissions Another option is to create a paid job board. Companies who want to advertise an open position to your audience can pay you to submit a listing. It\u2019s easier to create a successful job board if you narrow down to a specific niche. That way you can become the go-to site for anyone looking for a job in that industry, with minimal competition. This works great for established blogs in a narrow niche. For example, ProBlogger is now famous for their job board for professional bloggers. With WordPress, creating a paid job board is easy. See our tutorial on how to create a job board in WordPress with WP Job Manager for a step-by-step walkthrough. You can use the WooCommerce Paid Listings addon to charge for job post submissions.  13. Create a WordPress Event Calendar With Paid Submissions Instead of a job board, you could create an event calendar where you charge people to advertise their events. This also works well if you already have an established audience, because businesses will be willing to pay to reach your audience. A paid event calendar is a good monetization method for local or industry-specific websites. You might choose to advertise events in your local city, conferences in a certain industry, or even webinars or live streaming events. To set this up on your site, see our guide on the best WordPress event calendar plugins. Sell Digital Products With WordPress  If you\u2019re looking for a more low-maintenance way to make money online blogging with WordPress, then selling your own digital products may be a good choice. While you do have to invest the time to create the product up front, after it\u2019s created your work is very minimal. Here are a few digital products you can create and sell on your website. 14. Sell Ebooks on WordPress Ebooks are an obvious choice for creating digital products. They are relatively simple to write and produce. If you\u2019ve been blogging for a while, then you can collect some of your old blog posts and turn them into chapters of a book. Once your book is written, you can design a cover using a tool like Canva and create a PDF of your ebook. Selling digital products on WordPress is easy with a plugin. To get started, you can see our guide on the best WordPress eCommerce plugins compared. For digital downloads, we recommend Easy Digital Downloads. It\u2019s relatively easy to use and includes all the features you need to create your online store.  15. Sell Online Courses Selling an online course is another great way to make money online. Courses usually sell for a much higher price point than ebooks. You can charge a premium for your expertise. You\u2019ll need to create the lessons for your course, plus any supporting materials that you want to include such as downloads, slides, checklists, templates, etc. You will also need to decide whether you want to offer personalized support for your course. Some sites offer two tiers of each course: a basic version without support, and a premium version with email support. Once your course is ready, you can use a learning management system (LMS) plugin to deliver the course to your audience. We recommend using LearnDash with MemberPress. For detailed instructions, see our guide on how to sell online courses using LearnDash. 16. Host a Paid Webinar Webinars are a great way to build your audience, share your experience, and grow your business. But did you know they\u2019re also a smart way to make money online? Webinars are similar to online courses, but a webinar is live and often includes a question and answer section. WordPress makes it easy to host a paid webinar. Whether you\u2019re using your site to actually host the webinar, or just to advertise your webinar and register participants, it\u2019s crucial for your webinar success. For more details on how you can host a paid webinar, see our list of the 9 best webinar software for WordPress users. Sell Services Online Using WordPress  If you\u2019re looking for easy ways to make money online, selling services is the fastest way to get started. There\u2019s no up front investment of creating a product or investing in inventory. Instead, you can just create a \u201chire me\u201d page on your website and start looking for your first client. Here are a few ideas to get you started. 17. Offer Freelance Services As a blogger, you\u2019re already an expert on your niche. You can start earning an income by offering your skills and expertise as a freelancer. Freelancing is a popular way to make money online because it doesn\u2019t necessarily require any upfront investment of time or money. You can just start offering your services to your current audience. Once you start freelancing, you\u2019ll need a way to invoice and collect payments from your clients. We recommend using FreshBooks, but there are also other invoicing plugins for WordPress. If you\u2019re interested in freelancing to make some serious money online, then see our list of the top tools for WordPress freelancers, designers, and developers for help getting started. 18. Start Your Own Consulting Business Consulting is another way to make money online from your blog and share your expertise. Instead of offering your services, a consultant offers advice and strategy so that their clients can become more effective. As with freelancing, there is no startup investment. You can start offering consulting services on your existing blog. All you need is to create a page with a form so users can request more information. To easily create a professional, mobile-friendly form, we recommend WPForms. You can see this tutorial on how to create a request a quote form in WordPress to get started. 19. Become a Coach If \u201cconsultant\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like the right title for you, you can consider becoming a coach instead. A life coach offers advice, guidance, and accountability for setting goals and improving one\u2019s life. There are also other kinds of coaches, such as blog coaches, writing coaches, and more. Whatever your area of expertise is, you can provide one-on-one help to your audience with coaching sessions. To save time and make things convenient for your clients, you can set up a booking form so readers can schedule coaching sessions right from your WordPress blog. See our list of the 5 best WordPress appointment and booking plugins to get started. Sell Physical Products Online Using WordPress While selling digital products or services can be an easy way to start making money online, there\u2019s nothing quite like selling real, physical products. Here are a few ways you can get started selling products with WordPress. 20. Start an Ecommerce Business With WooCommerce  Have an idea for your own product? Why not start your own online store? WordPress makes it easy to create a shop or even add a shop to your existing blog using the free WooCommerce plugin. Starting an online store can be a lot of work, since you need to create or buy the products and then ship them out yourself. But selling physical products can be a rewarding experience, and sometimes a physical product is exactly what your audience wants. To get started, see our tutorial on how to start an online store with WooCommerce. You can also use Shopify or BigCommerce as WooCommerce alternative. 21. Create an Online T-shirt Store With WordPress Creating your own t-shirt shop is easy with WordPress. Almost everyone wears t-shirts, so opening up a t-shirt shop is a great way to monetize any kind of blog. Designing t-shirts allows you to be creative and offer something unique to your audience. It\u2019s easy because there are services out there that allow you to upload your own designs, and they print / ship it for you. You get a profit share. You can easily create your own t-shirt shop on your WordPress site using WP-Spreadplugin by Spreadshirt.  If you want a faster solution, then you can use a Shopify store which connects with dozens of t-shirt printing companies. 22. Create a WooCommerce Dropshipping Store Dropshipping is another way you can create an ecommerce store on your WordPress website without having to handle inventory or ship items yourself. With dropshipping, you create the store, manage the website, and customer service. But a dropshipping service will take your orders and ship them out to your customers. They\u2019re an invisible third party that your customers don\u2019t even know about. You can use the WooCommerce plugin to create a dropshipping store. There\u2019s also a WooCommerce Dropshipping addon plugin that allows you to automate the process. 23. Create an Amazon Affiliate WordPress Shop One downside of dropshipping is that you have to find a good supplier, which can be a challenge, and sometimes you have to place a large order up front. This can make it difficult to get started without investing a lot of money. If you want an easier way to set up an ecommerce site without having to ship products yourself, then you may want to try an Amazon Affiliate shop. As with many of the items on this list, this works best if you specialize in a niche. If you offer everything, it\u2019s impossible to compete with a big shop like Amazon. But in a small niche, you can differentiate yourself and really stand out. For complete instructions, see our tutorial on how to create an Amazon affiliate store using WordPress. Offering Platform as a Service WordPress comes with some incredibly powerful plugins that are actually full-fledged platforms in their own right. You can add such a platform to your blog or e-commerce store and offer it as a paid service. You get a cut from each sell, which allows you to earn passive income from user activity on your website. 24.Create an Online Marketplace Website An online marketplace is like an eCommerce store where users cannot just buy but also sell their own products. Normally, WooCommerce assumes that you run a single vendor website. You will need a plugin like WC Vendors to turn WooCommerce into a multi-vendor capable platform. After that, vendors will be able to register on your site and start selling. You can make money by charging commission on each sell, or you can allow vendors to buy membership packages for their listings. For more details, see our guide on how to make an online marketplace using WordPress. 25. Make an Auctions Website An auctions website allows users to bid on products to purchase them. This allows the sellers to maximize their profits and customers to find unique deals. Ebay is probably the best example of an online auctions marketplace. You can run auctions on your WordPress website and even allow third-party vendors to list their products as well. You can make money by charging for the listing or by getting a cut on each sell. To build an auctions marketplace with WordPress, you will need the following add-ons. WooCommerce (for shopping cart and payment features).An auctions add-onA multi-vendor add-onFor step by step instructions, see our guide on how to build an eBay like auctions website using WordPress. 26. Create a Job Marketplace website Unlike a regular job listings website, a job marketplace allows you to make money on each job listing. Fiverr and UpWork are probably the best examples of online job marketplace websites. You can promote your job marketplace as a micro-job platform for people working in the same niche as your blog. To make your platform more competitive you can select a very specific niche. This will help you easily find customers and professionals who are unable to use large platforms because of too much irrelevant competition. You can charge a small fee for job listings or when a job is completed. More successful completion of jobs will bring you more customers and freelancers in the future. For details, see our step by step tutorial on how to make a Fiverr like Micro-Job website using WordPress. Become a WordPress Designer or Developer  If you\u2019re more technically inclined, then you can become a WordPress developer or designer in order to make money online. This will take more technical skills, but it\u2019s not too hard to get started. 27. Develop WordPress Plugins Plugins are what make WordPress so flexible and powerful. Plugins work like apps, allowing you to extend and modify any feature of your WordPress website. Plugins come in all varieties, from very simple code modifications to complex software applications. If you have a basic grasp of how WordPress works and some simple PHP knowledge, you can create your own WordPress plugin. As a plugin developer, there are many ways you can distribute your plugins. Anyone can submit a free plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory, as long as they follow the WordPress plugin guidelines. This is a great way to gain experience and build a reputation for yourself as a WordPress plugin developer. Once you\u2019re ready to start selling premium plugins, you could choose to sell them on a site like MOJO Marketplace, or on your own WordPress site. If you\u2019re using your existing WordPress blog to sell plugins, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the plugin you create directly fulfills a need of your audience. You can survey them to see what problems they need to solve on their WordPress site, and then create a plugin that solves that problem. You can then sell the plugin on your site using Easy Digital Downloads. 28. Sell WordPress Themes If you enjoy web design and development, you could start creating your own WordPress themes to sell. This requires both design and technical skills. You have to know how to create a good-looking design, and also how to code it for WordPress. Using a WordPress theme framework such as Genesis can give you a head start. Then you\u2019ll need to design and code a beautiful child theme. 29. Sell Graphics on Your WordPress Site If you like design more than coding, another option is to design and sell graphics on your WordPress site. You can create graphics such as stock images or logos and sell them on your site using an ecommerce plugin. You can also join online marketplaces to sell your graphics as well. 30. Accept Donations  Last but not least, one way you can make money from your WordPress blog is simply to ask for it. You can begin accepting donations in a few different ways. You could add a Paypal donate button or a Stripe donate button to your website. Or for a more professional look and advanced features like email marketing integration, you could use WPForms to create a donation form on your WordPress site. Donations are last on the list because of their limited effectiveness, since you have to rely on the generosity of your readers. It\u2019s usually more lucrative to offer them something in return.

Blogging in itself has no limitations. And you will get really good answers already published on quora relating Blogging. For your query, i just wanna give short and sweet answer;For People to subscribe your blog, in the first place, they need to find it and they can find it either through search engines like Google (searching for certain term/keyword and your blog is listed among top 10 for that term), word of mouth through your friends, colleagues, relatives, partners etc or you can pay to media or advertising agencies (Like Google Adwords, Bing and Yahoo Network) to get people (we call it traffic) to your blog.Secondly, You need to focus on your expertise and your passion so that you can create contents easily without being frustrated in the long run (blogging is not entertaining, if you are not passionate about your topic and you will run out of unique content soon).Another thing, you need to learn about SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which is the life blood for many blogs which are dependent on organic traffic i.e. traffic from Search engines.Out of all the most important factor is create original contents which can solve people's problem and you will be noticed soon!!Good Luck!!

            "answer_text": "Your first option would be charging for content, that is, charging people a subscription fee to read your blog. You'd probably have to be a celebrity for this to be even remotely successful. Your second option is showing advertisements. This is the most common method, which means that there's lots of competition, which means that your margins will be razor thin. You need millions of readers to make good money with ads (and probably have to directly sell ad space, rather than using a service like Google AdSense which takes a chunk of the already thin profits). Your last option is using your blog as a funnel to sell something else, like a book, album, or t-shirts. The blog becomes more of a marketing tool than an actual money maker, but this is the option most likely to turn you significant profits. Of course, I'm only talking about the well-known, tried-and-true strategies. There's nothing stopping you from going out and inventing a whole new way of making money off your blog - but you'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting to make it work. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually it's really easy to earn Rs. 1000 per month with a blog. But you need to be smart while making decisions. You need to be patient, willing to spend a little bit money, have the attitude to never give up and can do some hard work. Where to blog : WordPress. I hate blogger. Believe me blogger/blogspot platform sucks.What will it take :  already mentioned above. How many days will it take : If you put the right effort, you can make money from your blog, from the 1st month on wards. If you want me to be specific, i can say that it will take atleast 20 to 30 days to make your first Rs. 1000 through blogging.  However you should have a clear picture or you should be proficient enough in the area or niche you blog about.Sometime choosing a blog niche can play some part. Blogging about presonal feelings can't earn you any money on internet unless you are a Superstar. So choose a profitable area or niche to blog, if you want to earn money via blogging. So one last thing that i will recommend is that, before starting a blog, Follow and read a lot of sites on internet. Choose the sites/blogs relating to niche and filter the blogs that earn more money and do a research about them. And next start a blog in a grand style and update with useful and worthy content frequently, so that people will visit your blog again and again.  The research part takes about atleast one month time. If you're  a brilliant you can finish it within a week.  I will publish a new eBook on my site factsnfakes.in soon that will reveal all the secrets about making money through blogging. So be in touch and visit my site regularly.That's all for now. Thank you and Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "Before starting a blog to make money. It\u2019s important to understand how you can make money through blogging: Affiliate marketing: Promote other people\u2019s product and earn a commission from it. Sponsorship: Companies will pay you or offer you incentives to promote them. Advertisements: Placing banner ads on your website and get paid by providers like Google for clicks and impressions. However, one thing that they all have in common is the requirement of having a huge audience base. After all, there is no money unless you have customers. Before starting a blog, you should also consider what niche topic you would like to base your blog on. Here are some evergreen niche examples for you. Regardless of your niche, helping and building your audience base will have to be your #1 priority. When I first started my blog, I didn\u2019t make any money for the first year. So definitely don\u2019t expect too much in the beginning. It takes time to be successful. People don\u2019t go to school and become rich right away. Making money online is no different. There\u2019s no shortcut. However, once you\u2019re successful, you can enjoy being able to work from home and potentially earn more money than any traditional job. ",

            "answer_text": "You can earn money by approving Google adsense Before applying to Google adsense plz read my article At Nepali techy Google adsense is the best contextual ads marketing program in the market with the most advertiser and highest payouts. It's shocking to hear that the application of many people is declined by Google adsense. If you just start a website and want to make money with little traffic then adsense is best for it. Application of most of the people is rejected by Google adsense because their website or content violates the adsense terms and condition. Before applying to Google adsense you should read the privacy policy and terms and condition of Google adsense properly. I am very happy to tell you that my site is verified 4 days ago, you can see it in the image also. Today I am going to tell you about top 10 strategies to verify blog for adsense. 1. You should buy a top level domain. Owning a website or a blog is nothing, you should good title and top level domain to it. If you use the free domains like .tk, .ml, and subdomain like ----------.WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or Blog, -----------.Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free., --------.Free Website Builder | Create a Free Website | Wix.com then there is very low chance of verification of adsense. Some people get approval with subdomain also but you should apply to adsense with top level domain like .com, .net, .org, etc to get adsense approval fast. Be sure to check my article about how to get free top level domain for a year.  Google adsense 2. Your blog content should not violates adsense polices. In adsense policies, it is clearly mentioned that \" your blog should not contain content related to hacking, cracking, sexual matter, violence, torrent, casino, gambling. Your content should not be copied from anywhere. If you copy it your content never rank In Google and adsense cannot be verified. 3. Your content is money. If you post quality content then there is no problem in getting approval adsense. Before applying to adsense your blog should have at least 15-20 posts containing more than 600 words. Try to explain the topic deeply as you can. Add some related image in your blog post to make it attractive. You can show video explaining it from youtube in your blog post. 4. Use the Google adsense optimized theme. It means use responsive theme. Due to the large number of mobile users, your blog or website should be mobile friendly to get adsense approval. Your theme should be good looking and your blog should look like professional blog. Make your blog neat and clean by removing unnecessary widgets. The navigation of your blog should be good so that your visitor find what you need easily. 5. You must use the pages like about us, contact us, disclaimer, privacy policy. If you do not use these pages then don't dream about adsense approval. The main purpose of making these pages is helping visitor to reach to you. If they have some question they can ask you through contact \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\ub9c8\ud2b8 - \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc0c1\ud488 \ud310\ub9e4 \uc804\ubb38 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158, To get approval from adsense you must include these pages in your website or blog. 6. You should have a single adsense account. If you made many adsense account your adsense cannot be verified because in adsense policies, it is clearly mentioned that you should not have multiple adsense account for personal use. 7. The background colour of your blog should be white. Because Google adsense likes it. If it is visitors can read it without any difficulty. 8. If you are using other company ads then remove all the ads from your site before applying to adsense. If you use other ads while they are reviewing your site than your adsense verification chance is less than 20%. After the approval of adsense you can continue it with other company. 9. While I am talking about the ways to get adsense approval, you may think about traffic. Traffic doesnot matter to adsense. You can get adsense approval if you have only 100 traffic but you should have quality content. In short your content is all thing to get adsense approval. I strongly warn you to use paid traffic for your blog. If you do so you never get verified for adsense. Page views doesnot matter but your traffic should be organic. 10. If your adsense is rejected while applying first time then thet send email to you abouy the reason for the rejection. You should have to fix the issue or problem that adsense show for your account. After solving it apply again. Conclusion  To create a blog or website is not a great thing. You should own your website or blog by using top level domain. You can make money from Google adsense if your content is perfect. You should focus on quality of content rather than other small matters. If you write a quality content and follow the above 10 points your blog is approved for adsense. If your adsense is approved and you have a traffic then you can earn dollars from home. At the end of the month you receive payment from Google adsense. You can make money just by writing quality article instead of doing physical work. At last I want to tell you that \" you should focus in the quality content \" if you focus on it and work on it then your adsense is verified 100%. Do you have any confusions? Please comment below about your question. I will try my best to solve your problem. If you want to send me message directly then use our contact us page. Hope this article is helpful for you. ",

            "answer_text": " Whether you\u2019ve started a blog yet or not there\u2019s one thing I can be sure of: you\u2019d like to make money. We all do. We need it in order to survive. What\u2019s so cool about \u201cthis day and age\u201d is that we can do it from virtually anywhere with the internet. My personal preference is to make money from my blog. In this post I\u2019m going to break down step-by-step how to create a profitable blog in 2018. How you can magnify your presence, make blogging fun, and of course how you can make money from your blog. Earning money from your blog seems like a far fetched idea sometimes. There are billions of blogs out there. There are so many things to write about and set up. But in reality it doesn\u2019t need to feel so overwhelming. I remember when I first started my blog back in 2012. I first created a niche blog that focused on the topic of \u201cdeals of the day\u201d in Dallas. It did just fine, but it was soul sucking. It had nothing to do with me and it wasn\u2019t making me happy. Then I created Helene in Between (my current blog). The blog didn\u2019t have a clear direction but I loved working on it. Fast forward to now. I still don\u2019t believe in blog niches, but I do believe in having a focused blog. I write about blogging and social media as well as my travels and life abroad. It\u2019s not so narrow that I\u2019m bored but it\u2019s not so broad that I want to throw in the towel with so much to do. Today I can say that I am meeting not only my blogging goals and making money from my passion, but living my dream. I moved abroad, I work from wherever in the world, and I have fun doing it. I am an average person. I am not famous or a genius. We all have our strengths. We can all find our passions, fine tune them, and create a blog and life we want. Do not underestimate your potential. We are all unique and we all have resources we can and should share. No matter what you want to focus on. This guide intends to give you everything you need to create a profitable blog this year. Whether you\u2019re starting from scratch and not even sure where to find a logo, or you\u2019ve been at it for a while and are ready to make money and see more traffic. It is simple to create a blog that you love and a blog that you can profit from. Here\u2019s how. HOW TO CREATE A PROFITABLE BLOG IN 2018 No matter what stage blogger you\u2019re in, I recommend reading this guide all the way though. I broke down the best ways to ensure your blog is on a steady path and one that helps you make money. Yes, even from the beginning! STEP ONE: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR? I think in order to make money blogging you need to figure out what you want to be known for. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to pick a niche. Of course, if you\u2019re super passionate about one particular subject, then by all means, go for it. But if you\u2019re like me, and you have varied interests and topics you want to write about, then you can still profit from your blog, regardless. So often we\u2019re told we need to pick a niche and when we do so, that\u2019s how we can profit and grow our blogs. I\u2019m here to tell you that is not the case. I believe focusing on interesting, relevant, and valuable content is the key to a successful blog. Instead of figuring out a niche think about what your focus will be instead. Answer this question: what do you want to be known for? Maybe you like talking about delicious recipes with a Southern flare. Perhaps you help bloggers create beautiful graphics. Or you are a traveler exploring the off-the-beaten path destinations. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re a combination. The key here is to focus on your passions. There is no way to have a profitable, money-making blog when you only focus on just trying to make a buck. People will see right through that. Basically, we want to write the type of content that people crave. That means it: reminds us that we matter, gives us hope or faith in the bigger picture, explains or tells a story, shows your authenticity, pulls at our emotions, surprises us (in a good or bad way), confirms our assumptions, takes us on a journey, challenges our way of thinking, entertains us, shows us successes and/or failures, gives us a unique point of view. Despite all of this realize that your message will resonate with someone. It\u2019s important to put it out there. STEP TWO: HOW TO DECIDE WHAT TO BLOG ABOUT Did you know exactly what you wanted to be when you grew up? What about in school? For me, I had no clue. I was always envious of those that knew they wanted to be a doctor, lawyer, mom, etc. I was not so sure. The same goes for blogging. Most people don\u2019t know what subject to pick. Deciding what to blog about can be one of the toughest parts. But if you KNOW you want to start a blog my advice is: JUST DO IT. Just start. If you don\u2019t start now then why wait later? You hitting publish on a post now won\u2019t rock the world, yet, but it also won\u2019t (most likely) offend or hurt anyone. So many people tell me: \u201cI\u2019m just so scared!\u201d It can be scary to hit publish but there\u2019s no time like now. When it comes to creating a blog I suggest doing a bit of brainstorming. Write out some things that you love and then start putting pen to paper. Or fingers to keyboard. Do you have to have a niche blog? My answer is of course no. But let\u2019s take a look at someone else: Chasing Foxes. This is just a wonderful, writes-about-everything blog and follows their passion. They make 5 figures a month. How? They write well and they focus on a Pinterest strategy (more on that later, keep reading!). PROFITABLE BLOG TOPICS: How to save money when\u2026. i.e. shopping, buying a home, renting/buying a car, saving for college, at Sephora Tips to cure\u2026 hiccups, blog design, writer\u2019s block, ugly photos, burned dinner How to find\u2026 the perfect prom dress, the best makeup for your face shape, the best recipe for Friendsgiving 20 Websites To Visit If You Want To Be a Better \u2026 Chef, Blogger, Web Designer, Photographer, Tennis player How to make money on\u2026 ebay, garage sales, etsy How to stop\u2026 procrastinating, overeating, anxiety How to start\u2026 working out, eating healthy, working for a magazine What does this all mean? Pick a few things you\u2019re passionate about and write with focus. Remember, it\u2019s okay if this changes! The beauty of blogging is that it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. There\u2019s this myth that in order to have stellar SEO (search engine optimization is how search engines, like Google, find your blog) you need to blog about one tiny thing. Like how to clean your toothbrush properly. Can you imagine writing daily about cleaning a tooth brush? No. And it\u2019s just not true. I write about a multitude of things and I still come up FIRST in many search engines for certain terms. So bottom line: chill out and let\u2019s start that blog! If you already have a blog skip on down to number five. STEP THREE: START A BLOG Let\u2019s get one thing straight: you CAN start a blog on a budget. But please, please set it up right the first time so you don\u2019t have to be stressed later. There is a (tiny) bit of grunt work to start a blog. But I\u2019m going to walk you through this. I guarantee if I can do this, so can you. SET UP HOSTING AND DOMAIN NAME I\u2019ve been on all the big platforms: Blogger, Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress. I wish that I would just always stick with WordPress. This is coming from someone who was a full-time, professional blogger who once was on Blogger. WordPress does it all and then some. If you\u2019d like a detailed pro/con list of why to go with WordPress or any other platform, check out this post. Next, you need hosting. Hosting is the service that allows your website to viewed and ensures that it can handle traffic. Before I made a decision I did tons of research (if you know me, you know that I always go over the top on my research). And I found the best hosting provider out there with Siteground. The main reasons? Reliability, support, and ease of use. Siteground works and they are there for you when you need them. Which can be really important if you run into any issues with your blog. They also offer an easy to use installer and free transfer. So it makes it seamless to transition your blog. Create a profitable blog today with Siteground. After clicking to go on to Siteground, follow these steps: Click \u201cWeb Hosting\u201d, the first option you\u2019ll see on the left. Click \u201cLearn More\u201d.Choose a plan. I suggest starting with \u201cStartUp\u201d (first option on the left). Click \u201cGet Started\u201d.Next, register your domain OR choose that you already have a domain. This is where you\u2019ll put in your \u201chttp://www.yourblgonamehere.com\u201d. The thing that I LOVE about Siteground is you can create a new domain RIGHT from the program. Click \u201cProceed\u201d.SaveEnter in your contact and payment information. I suggest getting the privacy and site monitoring services. This is to ensure your privacy. But of course, they are optional.Install WordPress. You can also have Siteground set it up for you!CHOOSE A THEME The theme of you blog gives it the look and feel that you want and allows you to structure your blog how you see fit. Unless you\u2019re a coder I suggest having a theme. There are two parts to a theme: the framework (think of this as the frame of a house) and the child theme (think of this as the paint and landscaping). The framework makes up the bones or foundation of your blog. I use and suggest Genesis. This is what I use for myself and the reason being is it\u2019s the best choice and works with many of my favorite child themes. As for your child theme this is what you can think of as the blog design. There are many options out there. I recommend Restored 316 and the options on Creative Market. A brand I\u2019m really loving lately for well priced (think under $50) designs is Code + Coconut. Simple and pretty themes that also work with Genesis. It will take some time to choose this but know you can always change it. If you feel particularly stumped with any of the above you can always ask for help. I use a company to help manage my blog and install my designs called WP Help. You might notice that some blogs have things like opt in boxes, social share buttons, and more. These are plugins they install on their blog (many are free) to customize the look and feel of the blog even more. CHOOSING A LOGO If you\u2019re looking for a logo you can design it yourself with tools like Canva or Photohop. If, like me, you\u2019re not great at designing there are a few tools that you can use to really help you out. I love the designs inside of Creative Market. You simply search for a logo you like and can even find designers who can customize it. I wanted a bit more detail to my logo but when I looked to hire a designer I felt it was crazy expensive. Then I discovered 99 Designs. Y\u2019all, this is a game changer! If you need anything designed (even a website) I highly recommend this. Here\u2019s how it works: specify what you\u2019re looking for. Then, you\u2019ll hear back from dozens of professional designers and be able to narrow down your favorites and what you like on your website. Then you\u2019ll pick your top 3 designers and they battle it out to create the best graphic for you. You pay one price. It\u2019s much cheaper than hiring someone and you get literally dozens of options. I am obsessed! STEP FOUR: HIT PUBLISH One of the most common questions I\u2019m asked: When should I start publishing on my blog? My answer? Yesterday. There is no right time. The sea will not part, you will not receive some magical sign. Many people are afraid to share. It can be scary to reveal more of yourself online. That\u2019s what a blog is, isn\u2019t it? But in order to succeed you just need to go for it. Yes, I do suggest to have an \u201cabout me\u201d page, a \u201ccontact\u201d page and maybe a page dedicated to what you are interested in or intend to write about, but it\u2019s not necessary when you first hit publish. Just putting yourself out there is enough. As you start writing you will learn what works for you and this will help you structure your other pages and your blog itself. Remember, your blog can change. My blog has had a number of major changes over the years: name change, about a dozen different blog designs, writing, direction, etc. I find that as you grow and as you write your blog will grow with you. The important step as you go is finding your ideal reader. Who do you want to read your blog. You MUST map this out. And it\u2019s important to think about this every step of the way. You cannot improve your blog, make money blogging, or drive traffic without having a solid understanding of your ideal follower. For me, my blog is a mix of things but my reader is clear: she is a 20-40 something woman who wants to live a meaningful life through experiences and goals. Tailoring your work to a specific audience is one of the best things you can do for your blog. When you try to write to everyone you wind up writing to no one. So sit down and figure out who your ideal reader really is and that\u2019s when you will find your community. Writing great content is not only how you\u2019re found online, it\u2019s establishing trust from readers. When you create confidence in your audience they are more likely to stick around, share your blog, and also buy from you. STEP FIVE: DRIVE TRAFFIC TO YOUR BLOG How do you drive traffic to your blog? There are only two things you need to really drive traffic and create a money making blog: killer content and a community. I\u2019m going to dive deep on what that means for each. First and foremost, write great content. It sounds simple but it isn\u2019t. In order to build a raving audience that continues to come back again and again you need to write wonderful content. You need to write something of value. This can mean vastly different things to different people. Maybe you\u2019ll discuss your struggles with infertility. Many women out there can connect with the same feelings of hopelessness. Or you\u2019ll write something funny about going to the grocery store in a foreign country. People will connect with this or it will make them laugh. If you\u2019re a social media expert you\u2019ll tell how to grow your Facebook page in a simple way. All of these provide value and offer inspiration. I like to call this \u201cfoundational content.\u201d You want to write content that makes people say: wow, I want to read that blog again. And then they do. They subscribe to your newsletter or they follow you on social media. Now, you\u2019ve started forming a community. This community is the one that will keep coming back again and again. But more than that they will share your content and will most likely BUY from you! Think about a blog you love. Why do you follow it? Now apply that to yourself. You need to create and foster a community and build it up with consistent, great content. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to post daily. I post about 2 times a week and feel happy with that (and receive about 150,000 views a month on my blog). You need to do what works for you. Truthfully, you can\u2019t have one without the other. If you have a community you won\u2019t want to piss them off with less than sub-par content. If you have great content that will encourage your community to spread the word and keep coming back for more. Creating both is how you get on the path to continually driving traffic and making money. Now of course, social media plays a vital role in this community and driving traffic. For this I suggest being on all platforms but concentrating efforts on one or two where you see the most potential. For example, I see the most traffic (personally) from Pinterest and Instagram. Therefore, I focus most of my effort on those two social media platforms. I regularly share to Instagram and Pinterest and I am constantly learning how to improve my skills on both. STEP SIX: CREATE AN OPT IN Okay, you\u2019re writing great stuff and building your community. You\u2019re starting to gain traffic. But wait, how can you keep them around?! Better yet, how can you make money? You need to create an opt-in. This free opt in will ensure that they stick around and hopefully buy from you in the future. When you create a newsletter or email list for your blog it gives you a chance to select the exact type of people that you want to keep coming back again and again. For example, let\u2019s say you write a post on your delicious healthy recipes. You create an opt in for a free meal calendar. Eventually, you will sell your recipe eBook. Since you created the freebie, you already have people on your email list who are your target market and would be very interested in purchasing from you. Take it from me, when I first started my email list I was at 0. Within 5 months I hit 5,000 newsletter subscribers and was making about $1,500 a month \u2013 just from my email list! Your newsletter is your direct connection to your audience. Creating an email list is how you turn casual readers into buyers and lifelong fans of your blog. Many people are worried about how often they should send out a newsletter (aka, they don\u2019t have time) or that they aren\u2019t sure what to send out to people. There is no rule book when it comes to creating an opt in. You don\u2019t have to send something out every time you post, every week, or even every month. I personally only send out my newsletter when I want to share something important (like a big life change), something valuable (like a deal or a sale on a product I\u2019m using I think they might like to use), or when I\u2019m promoting my own products or hosting a webinar. Honestly, I might share to my newsletter every three months or so. Here\u2019s a detailed guide on how to create a newsletter for your blog. I recommend using Convertkitbecause it\u2019s a straightforward, easy-to-set-up platform, created by bloggers for bloggers. I have used MailChimp in the past (it\u2019s free for up to 2,000 subscribers) but Convertkit is just so much more intuitive and helps me to make more money becuase I can easily segment my list. I also think it\u2019s easier to create the freebie and link it up to my blog through Convertkit. Here\u2019s the process: 1. Write a post on a topic you\u2019re passionate about. 2. Create a \u201cfreebie\u201d that people can opt in to that\u2019s related to the post. Example: an ebook, checklist, or pdf guide. You can create this straight from your computer. 3. When they \u201csubscribe\u201d automatically send them an email with their freebie. I do this seamlessly in Convertkit by creating a form that automatically sends them the download. 4. That\u2019s it\u2019s!! Only email your list when you feel like it. When you create an email list don\u2019t worry about having multiple welcome emails or opt ins. Start simple and you\u2019ll learn as you go. The important step is just to start it and you\u2019ll see over time which posts work when creating an opt in. STEP SEVEN: MAKE MONEY BLOGGING Let\u2019s get something clear, in case you just skipped on down to this step, you can\u2019t make money blogging without the above. You need to know who you\u2019re blogging to, why, create great content, and a community. That needs to be present before you can make money. They are all related to each other and reflect back on whether or not you start to monetize your blog. To me, there are many ways to make money blogging. But in reality, there are 4 key ways to create income for a blogger. Those are: advertising, affiliate marketing, sponsored opportunities, products (digital and physical), and online education. I want to take a brief look at each and how you can use them for your blog. ADVERTISING The ads on the sidebar, top, middle, and bottom of a blog are advertising. These can be from places like a network such as Google Adsense. Here\u2019s how ad networks work: you get paid per view and per click on the ads. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not anything like $1 per click and 20 cents per view. It\u2019s much lower than that. But it still adds up. The key here: the more views, the more money you\u2019ll make. Back in the day, in the advent of blogs, bloggers could make a full time income just from ads. Not the case anymore. Unless you\u2019re getting millions of hits a month, you\u2019ll need other strategies to make a full time income. How to succeed with advertising on your blog: the more page views, the more likely you\u2019ll grow your advertising income. AFFILIATE MARKETING One of my favorite ways to monetize a blog is with affiliate marketing. Here\u2019s how it works: you share about products, services, anything you love already on your blog. With affiliate links you link to the product and make a small commission on it when your readers click and buy. I love to share the products that help me grow my blog. And I make sure to only share about products that work for me. For example, I\u2019m a huge fan of Hootsuite, a scheduling tool for social media. When I blog about it (for example, this post on How to Schedule Blog Posts Like a Boss) I know if others click and buy, I make a small commission. It\u2019s already something I\u2019m using and loving and my readers can trust that I will only share about products I recommend. I also suggest creating posts that relate to the product or how you use it. When you show your audience why it matters or how to use it they are more likely to buy it. Again, this echos back to creating a community and sharing valuable content. How to succeed with affiliate marketing on your blog: only share products and services you love. Write posts that directly relate to the product and take it a step further by sending out an email to your list to encourage them to buy the product. SPONSORED OPPORTUNITIES Sponsored posts are ones where payment comes from either a company or third party that pays you a flat fee to include their product, service, event, location, you name it in your post. For example, I worked with Visit Britain earlier this year to write about my experiences in Manchester and Liverpool. I was paid a fee to write about my honest opinion. I\u2019ve also worked with companies like Pollinate Media and Collective Bias that help you connect with companies looking to work with influencers. If you\u2019re wanting to see how to work with companies check out how to make money with sponsored posts. OR, if you\u2019re a travel blogger, check out the full guide on landing sponsored travel. No matter what stage you\u2019re in you can get sponsored blog posts or social media shares. How to succeed with sponsored opportunities on your blog: only take things that your readers would love. Write the post in your normal blogging voice and deliver on time. Don\u2019t be afraid to negotiate and reach out to others. PRODUCTS OR SERVICES As far as products go, you can sell anything! From an eBook, course, coffee mug, t shirt, one-on-one coaching, you name it. Most of the time these products do take some leg work meaning, you have to set them up, create the payment system, deliver the product or online education, and promote them. But along with this, there are more opportunities for you to monetize. Instead of getting a portion of the profit you get all the profit. If you can provide value, whether a service or product, you can sell something from your blog. The key is to understand what your audience needs and how you\u2019re uniquely qualified to deliver it to them. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a graphic designer. You often write about how to design simple graphics. You start a course on how to design your blog from scratch. You can sell the course through Teachable (or really any platform that lets you sell courses or books) and promote the course on your blog, newsletter, and social media. A place I recommend to sell your Digital Products or courses is SamCart. This is what I use to take payments for my eBook, Lightroom Presets, and my online course. It\u2019s easy to use and makes selling your stuff simple. You can check out my shop here. If you\u2019re selling a physical product a great place to do this is Etsy, or you can have your own store front with Shopify. How to succeed with products or services on your blog: have a clear understanding of who you\u2019re selling to and WHY they need this. Make a plan of action and stick to it! No matter what area you choose to focus on, it\u2019s a good idea to have more than one iron in the fire. I personally bring in income from all of the above ways and it ensures that no matter what, I have one income stream coming in. Even if you\u2019re a beginning blogger you can still make an income, especially when you have a solid understanding of your reader, a newsletter in place, and some social media. Don\u2019t forget to analyze your results along the way. That goes for your whole blog. Keep track of your stats so you can see where to improve and what topics people gravitate towards. STEP EIGHT: LEARN A SKILL I wholeheartedly believe the best way to grow is to keep learning. I am always taking an online course, reading a book or blog, or listening to a podcast to learn what will work for me online. Enhancing your skill set not only helps you improve it also helps you make money. Remember how I said above about concentrating some efforts on social media? Learning a new skill and improving your social media, SEO, writing development, keyword research, etc. is a great way to continue to grow. I have taken classes on webinars, email marketing, SEO, business, Facebook ads, and so much more. Do your research to make sure the offer or course or book is legitimate. Then go for it. Make sure to hold yourself accountable along the way. If you got down to the bottom of this post\u2026 congrats! I know this was a doozy. But I wanted to completely cover the best way to monetize your blog, no matter where you are in the process. The best way to create a profitable blog is when you are passionate about what you do and share valuable content with your readers. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you been struggling to make money with blogging and freelancing? Well I\u2019ve been there done that, failed, bounced back and it\u2019s been one hell of a ride since 2006, when I made my first $108 with Adsense! And, when I say \u201cexperimented\u201d, it\u2019s been a test of 13,000+ micro niche blogs and even 6000+ are currently ALIVE! The key to success is keyword research - you need to learn how to find low competition keywords \ud83d\udc47  Next you need to learn how to write kickass content and setup a good Wordpress blog and perform on page SEO to ensure that search engines index it and find it worthy of ranking on 1st page Next comes the toughest part - SEO - link building or off page SEO whatever you\u2019d like to call it and then if you do everything right, you rank on 1st page of Bing & Yahoo! And then Google! And, I\u2019ve done it THOUSANDS of times, but let me tell you some interesting trivia Did you know Desi Bloggers World Fb group was formed in 2016, when there were no big blogging groups - just Premium Tricks by IFTISEO by Iftekhar Ahmed & HellBound Bloggers (HBB) by Pradeep Kumar, and a few others who were quite small groups at that time! I did 100s of free webinars every year, and even offline beats across all major cities in India and countless in Bangalore, where even I sponsored pizza/snacks at 91springboard Hyd, Delhi, Mumbai I incubated startups, and I started a movement of helping aspiring bloggers & startup folks and never charged a penny - even in 2020, every Sunday I used to take community sessions, and even today one of our free community members got first Amazon affiliate sale and sent me a thank you msg, but I never take credits though I do feel good  I always tell people I can just guide - rest it\u2019s their battle to fight & conquer! Now, a very important aspect, why are paid workshops happening now? - let me tell you the bitter truth - I\u2019m not a saint or bullshitting that I\u2019m not making any money from these workshops! However, truth be told I\u2019m currently doing it for BWU branding & I\u2019ve reinvested all the money on ads & video views ads and in last 2 workshops over 200 people attended and we don\u2019t have a single -ve feedback - I promised 5 days 7 hours and in both workshops I ended up doing 10+ hours and answered every single god damn session question! I also get loyal Fb insta youtube LinkedIn Quora followers in form of these attendees and bunch of other benefits But, the biggest thing I want you to understand is that when I used to do FREE community webinars, 40-50 people used to attend out of 160-200 and 1-2 used to take action Imagine if your college fee was free, would you take it seriously, and go daily? (Well yeah right you know condition of govt colleges, don\u2019t you?) Let\u2019s say even if you wanted to see a movie and you don\u2019t book tickets, you\u2019re indecisive till last moment, you don\u2019t show up and cancel plans due to lazyness or whatever but once you book, you make sure that you SHOW UP! Likewise, when 67 people registered for first workshop, 60 people showed up every single day and the 7 who couldn\u2019t attend, I refunded IMMEDIATELY! Next it was 150+ and our third batch is starting tomo night 9-11pm >>last 24 hours to register for BWU workshop<< Now at least people are taking ACTION, but I\u2019m NOT selling courses, and I know there are people in the market who are selling courses and promising to make you RICH! But this ain\u2019t one of them! I promise to show you how to make your first dollar, then $100 in 100 days through BWU premium program and then eventually $100/mo if you pursue it in long term, and it can even grow to $100/week or $100/day but again NO PROMISES! Now of course, people can see everything in 5 days but can\u2019t do much themselves except getting started with Quora, bit of freelancing, learning content writing and link building (SEO), but as you know SEO takes good 60-120 days time When they\u2019re serious enough to purse, they need - tools like ahrefs & keywords everywhere - help in selecting domain - hosting at discounted price - good theme like newspaper - essential plugins and proper wp setup - helps with powerful contextual links  All this is packaged in the Rs 22,000 - 50 days 50 hours Bloggers World University premium program and meant only for those who want to TAKE ACTION - again I\u2019m not doing any magic - those who managed to rank & bank are the ones who TOOK ACTION! There have been people like Manoj Kumar Kunchakarra who even got almost Rs 1 lakh worth of business through Quora & realised power of BWU with almost 400K views Ask every single attendee of workshop or BWU premium - paisa vasool hua ya nahi! Even if one person says NO, I\u2019m always happy to publicly REFUND! In fact, to this date, I\u2019m still chasing people like Mathew B R who enrolled and got busy, I got even articles written for them, a good domain, and theme - and now even happy to help him setup blog with premium theme and provide contextual links from our marketplace for free, just to get him to rolling There have been people like Anita Walker & Aditya Khatavkar who\u2019ve helped community members a TON selflessly, and now Hitesh Wadhwa is also seeing what goes behind the scenes! There have been people like Ankit who got freelancing work and now he\u2019s even flipped his blogs (not for big money, but still double of what he paid for BWU - separate case study will come next week when he gets the money) There are people like Deepak Singh Rajput who had no idea about blogging Seo and they\u2019ve no become expert at building blog and ranked #1/2 in Bing & Yahoo! And now his blog is also getting some traffic (i am tracking progress, but I guess he\u2019s gotten little busy) There are people like Om Patai who got local sales with google maps listing traffic for their business The list goes on and on and on... people who got jobs, people whom I\u2019ve hired, people who BENEFITED in one way or another! Pls understand the difference between SHITTY COURSES and LIVE SESSIONS - after buying a course, good luck contacting the course seller and getting a response, let alone getting direct ANSWERS to your QUESTIONS! You buy course, you don\u2019t learn shit and you DONT SHOW UP, or take actions! I\u2019ve bought plenty of courses but NEVER FINISHED EVEN ONE - heck I didn\u2019t even open the second video of a few as they were so crap I thought it was waste of my time, forget money! Here people enrol and make it a point to attend and then learn and take actions! Anyway I\u2019m not gonna stop until we touch 100,000 lives (also $1M revenue milestone) through Bloggers World workshops and 3000 members through BWU premium program (that will be $1M milestone) and everyone now and then I\u2019ve offered a free upgrade to those whom I feel, deserve it, basis their past efforts & Vishal Gangwar is the LATEST one! I\u2019ll keep putting free info on my YouTube channel, keep doing YouTube FB Insta live and FREE WEBINARS too, but workshops will continue too - nobody\u2019s forcing you, chasing you or selling dreams like Byju\u2019s or WhiteHat Jr- choice is yours! Open your eyes & see the reality before you judge anything or comment something blindly - if you still CANT, then I feel sorry for you, nothing else!

            "answer_text": "Great question! I\u2019ve asked myself this question over and over again before\u2026 How can one make money at home and quit his/her 9\u20135 job? First let me say that working from home definitely beats the 9-5, and that\u2019s coming from someone who used to work at the Airport as a passenger assistant. (you know, that person who pushes wheelchair). And sometimes it takes the worst parts of life to smack you in the face to help you realize that you need to make a change. And with that said, I\u2019m going to give you a bit of a sob story, but not to make you feel bad for me (I promise!). This is just to inspire you, give you context for why I decided to make the change, AND why I want to help you out too. Because anyone can escape the 9\u20135 if they want to. Also, I\u2019m going to make this a fast story so I don\u2019t bore you and lose your attention. Now let\u2019s rewind back to 2015 July 31. The day I became a father. I was 22 years old, dropped out of college and began working at the Airport to support my family. Now me without the college degree could only work part-time minimum. My girlfriend was a stay home mom, she wanted to take care of our daughter instead of leaving her to someone who can\u2019t babysit and whom we barely even know. This is where all the struggles began. Supporting a family with a dead end job, didn\u2019t have any college education, lack of financial literacy\u2026 The bills started to pile up. My girlfriend was suffering from postnatal depression. I didn\u2019t even know what was going on, there was so much things in my head I couldn\u2019t even follow anymore. There was so much stress going on in our life back then. I cried at night\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to see my own family like this. Then one day, I took a moment for myself. I walked for hours just to clear my mind. I thought to myself; I had to man up. I had to make a change. We can\u2019t live like this. This isn\u2019t life. I\u2019m not going to settle for less. My family is counting on me, I have to be strong and I have to be smart, I can\u2019t stress and let the noise distract me from being a great father and a great future husband. I started researching ways to work from home. I read about many online jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. That is until I read the book \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d from Robert Kiyosaki and \u201cThe Four Hour Work Week\u201d from Tim Ferris. And suddenly I was inspired; I knew I could replicate what he did in that book, I knew I could do that and let money work for me. I started a blog. check it out here: www.easydatingtricks.com In the beginning it was SUPER hard. We needed the money bad, but we made the sacrifice by putting our spending down to a minimum. Our car was breaking down every other week it felt like, we refrained from going out all the time, and buying new clothes. But after almost 7months of no extra income, the blog finally took off. Now fast forward to the present day, 3 years and a couple of months after launching the blog, we\u2019re now in boracay, The philippines. Why? Well.. because traveling is our passion and now that I work online, I can go anywhere with an internet connection. Now I would tell you how I did it in a few seconds. Spoiler Alert! You don\u2019t have to be tech savvy to do it! IMPORTANT: This is not meant to be cliche \u201chow-to\u2019s,\u201d but rather give you awesome value for your time. They\u2019re meant to give you REAL steps and help.. I promise! So now you\u2019re wondering, alright, great story bro, brought a few tears to my face (not really), but how do I start my own blog? Well I\u2019m going to show you step by step, it\u2019s super simple! And if you\u2019re not tech-savvy, then no worries, it actually isn\u2019t complicated. How to Start a Blog in 20 Minutes or Less? The step-by-step guide Whoa! Twenty minutes or less? Yeah, that\u2019s right! Here we go! Step 1 \u2013 Sign Up For Bluehost If you want to earn money with your blog directly then I suggest you to pick a webhosting plan, you can get hosting for $3.95, but only through my special link <<  Alright! So this is probably the most important part of the process (hence why it\u2019s step 1). Finding a host site is basically like renting a space on the internet to put your blog out there. You need it to run a website. I chose Bluehost because EVERY blogger kept on recommending it and whenever I\u2019d look at the reviews of other hosting sites, I was automatically turned off; nothing compared. Also, Bluehost made it super easy so it was kind of a no brainer. There are three plans, but I\u2019d choose the Basic Plan since you\u2019re just starting out. It\u2019s actually $3,95 a month right now WITH a free domain name (I don\u2019t know of any other hosting sites that do this), so I\u2019d jump on it right away. Oh! ALSO, if you decide to back out of the deal, you\u2019ll get your money back. How awesome is that? You can get started here with Bluehost!  Now quick side note: You might be wondering, \u201cWell I could just sign up for a free account with Blogspot or WordPress\u2019 free domain site,\u201d but you do NOT want to do this! Why? Well if your purpose for starting a blog is to make money from home, then you won\u2019t be able to do this with a free blogging site. You won\u2019t be able to run ads, create affiliate links, and the majority of companies won\u2019t work with you. So I\u2019d seriously suggest signing up with a Bluehost to make it official. Secondly, free blogging sites can DELETE your site at any time for any reason. It\u2019s happened to bloggers like Michelle from Making Sense of Cents. So it\u2019s best to make sure your site is secure and belongs to you. Step 2 \u2013 Make a Domain Name Alright, now with that said, let\u2019s get back on track. Once you sign up for Bluehost, you\u2019ll want to create your own domain name. Bluehost will help you out and let you know if it\u2019s taken or not. It can be a bit hard at first, but just make sure it\u2019s something easily said and spelled (nothing too long). That way your blog will be much more easily remembered.  Step 3 \u2013 Fill Out Personal Info Then easily fill out your information\u2026 gosh this is so darn hard!  Step 4 \u2013 Choose the Right Package Make sure you have the right package picked out. Important Note: I asked a Bluehost employee about the extra add-ons for security at the end. He let me know that they weren\u2019t really necessary unless your site got huge. So don\u2019t worry about those for now. I\u2019d suggest just installing Jetpack which is a free WordPress plugin (I\u2019ll explain down below), that\u2019ll help protect your site from attackers.  Step 5 and 6 \u2013 Billing info and Password Setup Next is your billing info and once that\u2019s entered in, you\u2019ll want to check your email for a confirmation and choose your password. Sorry, I know this is super hard.  Step 7 \u2013 Sign in and Install WordPress Now Bluhost will let you create your password and you\u2019ll be able to sign into your new Bluehost account, and once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll be taken to your homepage.  In this homepage, you\u2019ll want to click on the item that says \u201cInstall WordPress.\u201d You\u2019ll see this under \u201cWebsites\u201d as the second orange icon. This is where you\u2019ll be writing your content from. And from there it\u2019s pretty simple!  Press the start button to install  Step 8 \u2013 Fill Out Domain and Site Info Next you\u2019ll have to enter in your domain name and site info (pretty easy), and click the final button to install (site info will be a new password and username for logging into your WordPress site\u2026 I promise, it\u2019ll make sense in a moment).  And that\u2019s it! You\u2019re done installing WordPress! Step 9 \u2013 Enter in Your Admin URL Next, you can take your admin URL and enter it into your web browser.  Step 10 \u2013 Login to Your New Blog And lastly you can log into your new WordPress blog account! Now where\u2019s that Staples \u201cThat Was Easy\u201d button, because that was pretty darn easy!  Now I hope signing up for your own Bluehost Wordpress account was easy and if you have any questions at all, feel free to leave them down in the comments below. But I\u2019m gonna go out on a whim and say that it probably went on without a hitch. Now For Some Tips on How to Navigate Your WordPress Site! If you want to create a new post, just hover over the \u201cPosts\u201d option on the left side of your page and click \u201cNew Post.\u201dWhen creating a post, feel free to click on \u201cMedia\u201d to download images.I told you I\u2019d tell you about Jetpack and so here we go! Jetpack is a great plugin (I\u2019ll also explain how to install plugins.. so crazy simple!) that\u2019ll protect your site from attackers/spammers, optimize the speed of your site, andyou\u2019ll get the option to see your blog\u2019s stats. This means you\u2019ll get to see how many viewers have been on your site for that day, what sites they\u2019re coming from, and how many views each post on your blog has for that day.Now for plugins! The \u201cPlugins\u201d option is on the left side as well and you\u2019ll want to hover over it until you see the option, \u201cAdd New.\u201d Click on that, and then you\u2019ll have the option to see suggested plugins and search for ones you\u2019ve heard about yourself. One I would suggest would be the \u201cGoogle Adsense\u201d plugin. This\u2019ll allow you to insert ads into your site (with no hassle) and start making income from them.A Note on Blog Themes Now if you\u2019re looking for a theme for your Bluehost/Wordpress site, then I\u2019d suggest looking at the free and paid for options that Bluehost has. However, for not much money (probably around $100), you can have someone find a theme for you and design the site to your liking. Something Important to Think About When you just start up your blog, it\u2019s super important to begin your email list. Now many people wonder if they should start their email list right after they launch their blog. But guys\u2026 those first few subscribers are the most important ones you\u2019ll have. It\u2019s been shown that the ones that stick with you even when you\u2019re just beginning will be your most loyal readers and they\u2019ll be more likely to buy from you when you offer them a product. So Which Email List Builder Should I Use? Well you could use a free service like Mail Chimp, but there\u2019s a couple things you should know. First, there have been so many times where I\u2019ve heard bloggers complain about how they regret starting out with free services like Mail Chimp. Because when they decide to switch over to a more efficient email list builder like Convertkit, it take hours for them to transfer their entire list. It\u2019s a complete headache and takes DAYS to do. Now the reason why I suggest Convertkit is because their services are SO EASY to use! I am not tech savvy\u2026 at all. In fact, I get seriously frustrated when something takes way to long to figure out. But with just one video tutorial, I was able to easily understand everything. Convertkit is seriously intuitive and simple. Now the monthly cost for Convertkit is $29.99 a month which is basically 5-6 Starbucks drinks in a month. I get it, it\u2019s so much easier to sign up for something free when you\u2019re first starting out, but the ease of using Convertkit is so worth it (and you won\u2019t have to deal with moving all your subscribers over later)! You can check Convertkit out here and they are hosting a webinar training this week on \u201cHow to Make Your First Dollar Online: \n6 Strategies from Real People Earning a Living Online\u201d If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

            "answer_text": "Creating a blog that makes money puts one thing as its number one asset at all times: the audience. You\u2019re providing content that is designed to be consumed and read by anyone and everyone. It won\u2019t appeal to anyone and everyone, but it\u2019s not designed to, otherwise you\u2019re trying too hard to please too many people and end up pleasing no one at all. Blogging is more than just writing about something you\u2019re interested in. It\u2019s about growing and retaining traffic. Here\u2019s how you go about that. Choose a niche. A niche is a specific population who have a shared interest or hobby in the same thing. Usually people pick a niche that they\u2019re invested in as well and it\u2019s an easy step. Do you enjoy collecting monopoly boards from around the world? Chances are that there are plenty of other people who enjoy that as well. Find out if people will care about this niche and potential topics you\u2019ll write about by doing some keyword research. Google\u2019s Keyword Planner is a commonly used tool, or you can try a third-party tool like The Hoth. Plug in a few keywords based on the topics you\u2019ve brainstormed, like \u201ccollecting monopoly boards\u201d. It\u2019ll reveal how many people are searching for these terms each month (the more the better).Figure out who your ideal reader is: In the marketing world, we call this exercise creating your \u201cavatar\u201d. It\u2019s an imaginary person who would read your content based on their demographics and behaviors. Maybe your avatar consumes content on certain podcasts or follows specific social media accounts. Once you\u2019ve figured out where your avatar hangs out, it makes it easier to create content they would enjoy reading.Research keywords: If you haven\u2019t come across this term, it\u2019s pretty much synonymous with blogging. Mastering the art of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) gives you a huge boost up so that your content is found on the first page of Google\u2019s search results. Start by identifying niche-driven keywords. Keywords are basically what people type into Google when they\u2019re looking for something. The more specific you can get your keyword, the more likely it is that your content will resonate with a reader. Try to include this keyword in your headlines and the body of content but don\u2019t force it, as Google can tell when you\u2019re stuffing it in there for the sake of it when it contextually doesn\u2019t make sense. If keywords and SEO is new to you, not to worry. Focus on creating quality content that leaves your reader feeling like you\u2019ve given them something of incomparable value.That\u2019s a pretty standard formula on how to generate traffic. It usually takes at least 6 months before your content will start ranking on Google\u2019s search engine. But once it does and you are gaining a big crowd of traffic, you can think about monetizing your site. There are a number of ways to earn passive income from your content. Affiliate marketing: To earn money with affiliate marketing, you\u2019d recommend a service or product to your readers. A cookie gets stored to track whether or not they go on to make a purchase. If they do buy something, you earn a commission on the sale. In the example of the motorbike site, you might include affiliate links for clutches in a \u201cbest of\u201d guide parts that wear out quickly. A lot of people use Amazon Associates but you can consider Commission Junction or ShareASale if the products you describe a very niche. If you have a lot of traffic, you can earn some serious money by applying for private affiliate programs that pay much more than the popular ones. Just remember to keep your products relevant to the affiliate links you\u2019re including.Advertising: You\u2019ll probably be aware of all the ads that pop up when you browse a site you love visiting. Sometimes you might click on one. You can have these ads pop up on your site as well by applying for display ad networks. Google Adsense is the most common one that bloggers use. You\u2019re usually charged on a cost per click (CPC) basis, where you get paid a flat rate each time someone clicks on an ad. Other display ad networks might use the cost per thousand impressions (CPM) approach, where you\u2019re paid for every thousand times your ad was shown. CPM is a useful approach if you\u2019re getting a lot of traffic since it doesn\u2019t need someone to click on it. However, this just raises awareness of a product or service. Advertisers often want people their ads to result in people visiting their page, which means a click is more desirable. Compare the rates to see which ones work better for you.Online courses: If you can establish yourself as a real authority in your niche, people will want to learn from you. Hone in on that demand by creating a course or series of courses to address your followers\u2019 desire to be better at a skill in your niche. They sell more than other products you can feature on your site which factors in the amount of work it takes to produce a polished course. You can also have a tiered pricing system so people can access gated content according to their membership level. Taking motorbikes for example, you might teach people how to thoroughly clean a motorbike in a basic course for $100. At the premium membership level for $500, you\u2019ll teach customers how to maintain it and which parts you have to change, in addition to best practices on cleaning.Ebooks: Reading is still considered one of the best ways to learn. And creating an ebook is a time-efficient way to do so. When you generate a lot of content, you can distill all of it into one curated ebook that focuses on one specific topic, which adding in an additional chapter or updating certain chapters. While readers could technically discover this themselves, what you\u2019re doing is providing a convenient way to learn more about one specific topic in the niche in a highly focused method. Every chapter in your ebook is about that idea and you won\u2019t be bothered with random noise. This is great if people are looking to fast track learn about one area in a short space of time.Paid webinars: Webinars are a largely under-utilized form of marketing and a way to provide educational content. Similar to a course, you\u2019re providing knowledge in a condensed session which gives customers a chance to interact and ask questions if anything crops up.Diversifying your revenue across many streams of income means you\u2019ll be earning a lot through your blog, maybe even more than your regular job. You might find that the work required to meet the demands of content creation is beyond what you can handle as a one-man operation and you need to hire a team. As you continue to match your blog\u2019s growth, you\u2019ll scale your blog into a valuable online asset. If the time comes when you get tired of it or want to pursue a different project altogether, you can sell the blog. These types of online businesses sold for an average of $99,525.01 on our marketplace in 2019. What would you do with that amount of capital? ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways, actually, provided you can actually write. You could, for example, become a content writer for other blogs and online media: Many companies have a blog on their website that needs content. So, make a list of topics you can write about with authority and do a web search as to which companies may need your expertise. Try to get in touch with the person responsible for the blog, usually a marketing of corporate communications official. You may get lucky. However, this content is often provided by third parties like advertising or PR agencies. So, look around for agencies specializing on digital communications. They may need fresh talent. While the pay may be not as good, dealing with the end customer (often stressful) is not your job anymore. That has its advantages. Alternatively, you can try freelancer sites like Upworks, Guru, Fivrr etc. They often list job offerings for content writers. Do some good jobs for them and you may build a reputation (or even convince your clients to leave that platform and deal with you directly, which may mean higher pay as you skip the middleman. One word of warning, though: They payment on these sites is usually very low and there are also some bad sheep out there. Finally you can try and start your own blog. Provide good content on a very regular basis, build a fan base and monetize through ads and/or merchandise from books to t-shirts. For this, you may need to offer content to online media, which pay \u201cwith exposure\u201d (meaning they expect you to provide your content for free): This can be a good deal: A couple of articles in a big and/or well respected online medium go a long way in building your own reader base. You may want to start your own blog anyway if only to be able to produce work samples when asked. If you can point to a well-maintained blog, it may get you customers even if you lack other experience. I strongly suggest to find a niche or specialty topic to write about: Learn all you can about it and stay about it. You expand your area of expertise later. In any case, it is \u201ca long way to the top if you want to rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d (to quote the infinite of Bon Scott). It may involve a lot of hard work and the risk of failure is high. So, good luck on you journey, but don\u2019t quit your day job just yet. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are into blogging and would like to monetize it through \u201cweb development\u201d as your niche. Then you should do the followings:- 1: Finding Ideas from Keywords You have likely heard the term \"keyword research\". This is the act of finding keyword phrases that are relevant to your niche and deciding whether or not it is appropriate to build content around that particular keyword. This is going to be the \u201croot\u201d of all your search engine optimization success, so we are going to be tackling keywords here before we get into creating content. A keyword is simply a word or phrase that people search for in the search engines. Every time you do a google search you are entering a \"keyword\" into the search box. Ultimately, the goal of your keyword research is to find keywords that you can get rankings in Google, Yahoo, and Bing with, all while attracting a relevant audience. You will be using the keywords that you find in this lesson to build content around. This will lead you to search engine rankings and traffic to your website! Each page you create will be targeting a keyword... 100 pages targeted 100 keywords = 100 potential Google rankings. This can and will lead to mass amounts of traffic and those that follow along with this training are going to see their traffic continue to go up with every \"keyword targeted\" page or post that they create on their website. Remember, Google and other search engines are around because of CONTENT and if you can deliver quality content (that targets low competition keywords), you will be able to get great rankings! The simplest way to do it is through Alphabet Soup Technique - Using Google Instant to Find Keywords. Well, it\u2019s a simple technique that you can use with a little help from Google. Actually, we\u2019ll be using the Google Instant feature that occurs automatically when searching for anything using the Google Search Bar. Have you every noticed that when you place a subject or question in Google search, that Google automatically populates your search menu with similar or related searches that you\u2019re looking for? For example, I type in \u201close body fat\u201d into the Google\u2019s search bar. Google Instant will automatically populate my search with the top search results that are similar to my keyword or keyword phrase. The way the Alphabet Soup Technique works is by.. 1.) Take your blog post topic or keywords that you would like to investigate, and put it into the Google search bar. 2.) Then add the letters of the alphabet, one at a time, and see what is actively being searched for on Google. You can also add a letter and go through the alphabet at the beginning of your keywords to see what Google Instant comes up with. Or you can use a question at the beginning of your keyword phrase starting with.. WhoHowWhatWhenor WhereThen you will see a whole new series of keyword phrases that you can potentially use as keywords for your next post on your website. 2: Create Quality Content Content is going to be the \"meat\" of your site. Content will be the difference between getting lots of traffic becoming an authoritative site, and you not seeing much in the way of results. Plain and simple, content leads to rankings in search engines and rankings are going to lead to your website traffic and revenue! Google, BING, & Yahoo LOVE Content! These are the top 3 search engines and make up over 98% of searches online. Want to know how you can leverage these search engines and get mad traffic to your site? The answer is: Quality content. The most important aspect of any content, whether it is text or video is that it is created with the reader in mind. Real people are reading this content so you want to deliver something that is relevant and interesting. When writing content you want to keep in mind that you are writing it for people, not just for Search Engines :) Being original, candid, and building your personal brand is the best way to succeed within any niche, so please make sure you do put some effort into creating your own content. There is nothing wrong with getting some concepts or ideas from elsewhere to incorporate in your page as this will save you time. Refrain however, from copying and pasting other people's work as you will lose ANY chance of ranking if you have duplicate content on your site. People are going to be navigating on our website, they are going to be reading our content, and they are going to be buying from us based on our recommendations. They are going to be engaging in discussions, they are going to be sharing our content on social networks, and they are going to be trusting us and our brand. Don\u2019t lose sight of this, I see it all the time where people get so lost in the process of what they are doing that they dehumanize their website to the point where no visitor would get any value. It is all about the EXPERIENCE you create. 3: Find Affiliate Programs to Promote Google \u2013 the easiest way to identify relevant affiliate programs, simply insert your keywords into the search engine and you may find products that suit your niche.AdSense Ads \u2013 many of the AdSense ads appearing beside Google search results, someone's blog, and even on your own blog are likely to be products with affiliate programs attached. It is sometimes worth checking out the ads (don't click the ads on your own blogs, you will be penalized) to find out the potential affiliate partners. Very often, you will be surprised to find some great affiliate programs that you might not know.Affiliate networks \u2013 there are quite a few affiliate networks around that list many affiliate programs. Most of these have search functions to allow you to type in keywords and find promotions relevant to your niche.

Some time during your blogging adventure, you will lose focus as you are not earning enough and will stop at that point. This rule does not apply just for blogging but for every kind of business you are planning to start. It should be passion first and money next. Treat the income as just a by-product of your blog. Do it with passion and build up your blog and your profile on the way but don't do it for money alone. If you arleady have a blog and want to monetise it, there are many ways to do it and one of the best is Google AdSense.  Google Adsense: Signup up for Google Adsense and once approved you can place these ads in your blog. If you are using WordPress you can install plug-ins to display the ads from your Adsense account. There are also Affliate Programs which will pay you when someone buys a product on their site through the link/ad you posted on your blog.

            "answer_text": " Making money from a blog is definitely doable, it just takes time and dedication. If you want to make more than pennies, I strongly suggest you focus on creating quality content and building a loyal community first. Here\u2019s the harsh truth - starting a blog solely for the purpose of monetizing it can leave you sorely disappointed. More than that, it\u2019s easy to get discouraged if your initial efforts don\u2019t pay off. BUT. As long as you\u2019re passionate about the content you\u2019re putting out there, other people will be as well. Your blog will grow organically and money will soon follow. Pretty straightforward, right? That being said, let\u2019s say you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019d like to start experimenting with monetization. If that\u2019s the case, you can try one or more of the following strategies.  Advertisements This is the most common and simple way bloggers earn cash \u2013 by leveraging Google AdSense to incorporate banners or other types of advertisements on their websites. This means that Google does much of the heavy lifting for you and you don\u2019t need to be in direct contact with advertisers. Needless to say, it can be a plus when you\u2019re just starting out and are nervous about reaching out to brands yourself. If AdSense doesn\u2019t work for you, there are other similar platforms available, like Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide or Infolinks. Sponsorships On the same note, there are influencer networks (IZEA, Mention, Influenster, Webfluential etc.) that can help you discover great sponsorship opportunities. This makes them a great starting point for bloggers looking to build relationships with brands. Brands often want to pay you a set amount for a sponsored post, in which you talk about their product or service. As expected, prices and requirements vary depending on brand. You also need to have a decent following to be able to score sponsorship opportunities. Sometimes, brands will offer to send you a product in exchange for a review, with no money changing hands. This is pretty common when you\u2019re not an established voice. As your blog grows, you\u2019ll be able to better negotiate a fee as well. Affiliate links Another common way to generate income from your blog is through affiliate marketing. Here\u2019s how this works: a brand has a product that it wants to sell. They give you a unique link to incorporate on your blog. Once that\u2019s done, every time a buyer comes from your site you earn a commission. Bloggers can either get affiliate links directly from brands if they have a partnership or join programs like Amazon Associates. A lot of big brands have affiliate programs. You just need to check out their website to see exactly how they work. Selling products Once you have a solid community around your blog, you may be able to earn good money by selling digital or physical merchandise directly to your followers. Merchandise can entail anything from e-books to online courses to apparel, depending on what your niche is. You can even sell memberships to your blog, offering paying clients access to extra content. That\u2019s what Mark Manson does, for example. Building credibility This one is the least straightforward of the bunch, but it can also be the most lucrative. You can use your blog to build a solid personal brand, which will lead to more opportunities. Again, these opportunities will largely depend on your niche. For instance, you may score a new job if you\u2019re diligent about showcasing your skills through blogging. Or start consulting for other companies. If you\u2019re a writer, you may end up with new freelance gigs. Speaking engagements are also not out of the question. All these endeavors will bring in extra cash as a direct result of your blogging efforts, which is pretty cool. To sum up A smart way to go is to experiment and mix and match as many ways to generate income as you feel are suitable for your blog. At International Fashion Bloggers we have a lot of great articles on making money from your blog, please see them here: https://heartifb.com/category/monetization/ In the beginning, this will likely be a game of trial and error. However, once you get to know your readers better, you\u2019ll be able to tailor your monetization efforts to what really works, resulting in a significant boost in income. Good luck! ",

We barely started getting used to giant platforms while the next revolution comes to our homes. While all social media and blogging platforms are based on the rule of hosting space for you and tipping you some fracture of money they get from ads, blockchain technology allows us to get a more direct stream of income.

The biggest and the most friendly community gathers around Hive blockchain, Hive is just an underlying protocol that allows managing data in a decentralized manner, it stores all uploaded content, allows monetizing, and guarantees immutability and being censor-resistant.

            "answer_text": "Let me start off by saying there\u2019s a big difference between starting a blog as a hobby and starting a blog to make money. Starting a blog is not so hard and there are a lot of advice and blog posts out there teaching you just this. But starting a blog that has a chance of success and will actually make you money, takes more effort, planning, thinking and research. If you look at most guides that teach you how to start a blog it goes like this; Choose a blogging platformGet a domain name and hostingDesign your blogAdd some posts and pagesGrow your blogSounds pretty straightforward, right? And don\u2019t get me wrong, this works fine if you want to start a blog and you\u2019re not overly ambitious. But if you want to start a blog that you want to turn into a business you should take some steps before you choose a blogging platform. These steps are; Choosing a topic for your blogThinking about how you will monetize your blogFinding out what your audience wantsThinking about your \u201cpillar\u201d contentIt\u2019s important for you to realize that if you want to build a successful blog that actually makes you money you have to take these steps first. Think about this. You want to start a shop and sell designer boots. Would you just sign a lease contract, chuck some shoes in the shop and start selling? Probably not. No, you would probably carefully plan it. You would do some market research, look at your competitors, think about what your target market is and carefully think about your pricing and promotional strategies. Which approach you think is more likely to be successful? I\u2019ll bet you it\u2019s the second one. So why do so many people start a blog without first thinking about it? It doesn\u2019t make sense. Of course, it\u2019s much easier & cheaper to start a blog than it is to start a physical business. If it doesn\u2019t work out then you just pull the plug and all you lost is a couple of hundred dollars in hosting, a website theme and the time you\u2019ve invested. If you really want to start a blog that attracts readers and eventually makes money you have to take some very important initial steps. You need to put in the work. You need to do your research. You need to be willing to pull up your sleeves. Here are the 10 vital steps you should take when you want to start a blog that will actually make you money: What topic to choose for your blogThink about how you will monetize your blogFind out what your audience wantsThink about your \u201cpillar\u201d contentChoose a blogging platform for your blogHow to pick hosting and a domain name for your blogHow to install wordpress onto your new domainHow get a good looking blog designHow to add all essential pluginsAdding posts & pagesThese basic 10 steps will get you all set up. If you follow them then I promise you that you\u2019ll have a blog up and running that actually has a chance of making money. By following these steps you\u2019ll be ahead of 98% of the bloggers out there. I wrote a detailed guide that goes in depth on each of these steps. You can read this guide here: How To Start a Blog That Will Actually Make You Money Let me know what you think of it. This guide is very, very extensive and has over 7,000 words so it\u2019s best to bookmark it and use it while starting your blog. After following the guide, one of the best things you can do is connect with other bloggers in your niche. This will help you to get your content in front of the right people that already have an existing audience. It\u2019s also called influencer marketing and thing you can do or for example: writing guest posts, write a round up post, mention other bloggers in your articles and start sharing their content. Just make sure you follow all of these steps first. If you have any question about starting a blog then feel free to ask me questions or drop me an email.

            "answer_text": "Blogs can possibly be very rewarding, yet don\u2019t accept that you\u2019re going to begin bringing in cash in the main week, or even in the primary month. It could take a half year to a year to begin seeing a constant flow of pay. Blogging takes work and devotion, yet once you build up a huge enough crowd, there are a few techniques you can utilize to adapt your blog. Here are some of them. 1. sell advertising space on your blogWhen you have a mainstream blog, sponsors or advertisers will approach you for the chance to publicize. The most ideal approach is Google Adsense. Google finds the sponsors for you and you should simply put the Google Adsense code on your blog to begin running promotions and ads. Google Adsense takes the entirety of the difficult work out of the procedure and just transfer your commission in your bank account.2. Affiliate programsAn affiliate program is a commission-based approach to promote. At the point when your readers tap on a link on your blog, they redirected to a sponsor\u2019s website and you win a commission in the event that they buy. Affiliate connections are an incredible method to win salary using item audits. Be that as it may, you should make sure to show your affiliation in your disclosure.",

            "answer_text": "So many so often ask the question of \u201cHow can one make money starting a blog?\u201d. While I understand the inclination to ask this question right from the get go, this is usually the one question that most full time bloggers steer you away from. Lets first start with your obvious motivation to become a professional blog writer. In other words, replace your current career situation to one of an online entrepreneur. Who doesn\u2019t want this? Even if you hate the idea of writing, what an amazing thing that can be done in this day in age. Write about almost anything and stand a chance at making a career out of it. While this seems to be the primary desire, making money blogging, you are sure to fail if this is your primary motivation. Of course we want to make money blogging, but lets go a little deeper. You should ask yourself some questions ahead of time, before diving into what seems like an abyss at times, the world of blogging. A travel blogger from Blogging From Paradise by the name of User-11927343435518957440 wrote a guest piece on my blog titled 10 Things for New Bloggers to Consider | Wealth With Rob. Here he outlines 10 things for new bloggers to consider. I will not rehash what was done on the article, but I will focus on number 1. Ryan poses the question, \u201cwhy are you blogging?\u201d \u201cMost new bloggers blog to make some money. Which is a poor driver which always leads to failure. A few may want to become full time, pro bloggers. Awesome, but you need to commit fully to blogging to make your dream come true. Be ready to pay the price to become a full timer. A select, rare few simply blog to have fun and to free themselves. These guys and gals become superstars. Pick a fun, freeing driver as a newbie and you will be unstoppable. Pick a niche you feel passionate about (Tip #10). Don\u2019t chase profits; chase passions.\u201d The last 2 words are what you should focus on. \u201cChase Passions\u201d. After all if you are passionate about it, others may be as well. The reason for this is quite basic. Attracting people to your blog is what will bring life, interaction, and yes you guessed it, the potential money. If people are passionate about something there is almost always a market for things related. For crying out loud there is a blog called Odyssey that generates tons on traffic for speaking about just weird things in culture and the internet. The moral of the story is find out what you are passionate about first and then the money will come. Provide a need, then you will be compensated. Hope that helps. ",

Even if you have a good content, and the traffic to your blog is not sufficient, the monetary gains won't be as per your expectations.  Here are few things you can (this is as per the travel blogs I follow ) Create your own website. You can have your own domain name registered and you will have complete authority on the contents you publish. ex: The Shooting Star , Be My Travel Muse - Off the Beaten Path Adventures , Wandering Earl , Nomadic Matt's Travel Site , etc In case you don't wish to start with your own website, you can start writing on blogs/websites which support affiliate programs. One of them is Vacation Ideas - Bookable Travel Ideas by Yonderbound . This website allows you to write your own travel stories along with a link for hotel, hostels, etc which you have experienced during your travel. The aim is to allow users to direct to these paid links. Everytime a user use these links to make a booking, you are paid a small portionYou can also reach out to travel magazines, blogs where you can write as a guest or freelance. Remember the beauty of digital media is, single content can be shared across multiple platforms.On a side note, use Instagram if you are good with camera. Above are the ones, I know are tried and tested methods. I am hoping to find more ideas with suggestions from various people. Source for links: Blogs I personally follow. ",

Also, if your blog works out and you\u2019re an accomplished writer, you can start an educational program and teach people blogging. A lot of bloggers have their online courses which create a steady flow of money. Thirdly, you can start selling your own merch. Producing a T-shirt or anything else with your catchy phrases is not that expensive, so lots of bloggers make it work. Not to mention the fact that you can use your blog posts as writing samples and get yourself a job as a writer or a copywriter. In fact, having an audience is very important these days. It\u2019s a starting point for you, from which you can go wherever you want to. Some bloggers start other careers, become ambassadors of different brands. Make your blog interesting, and one or two doors will open to you anyway. ",

Catchy quotes, questions, or anything unique would be perfect to begin you blog post.Include Images: images can drive lots of traffic because pictures are more powerful than words- in some situations. People would take a glimpse of the images on your blog instead of reading the entire post. But if you have attractive images, few people would be intrigued to read your post.Writing something that your audience would like to read.

            "answer_text": "How to Make Money Blogging Today, I'll break down the four main ways people blog money. Everyone is described in detail and I hope it will help you to understand how bloggers make money from their websites. Who knows, it could encourage you to start your own blog!  Advertising One of the first ways most people try to make money blogging is by advertising. Some types of advertisement bloggers use to make money, including pay per click ads, direct advertising and sponsored posts. Pay-Per-Click ads pay-per-click advertising is usually offered by advertising networks that are large companies that contract their products with brands and retailers. Instead they turn around and sell back the advertisements to website owners and bloggers. The pay-per-click is typically very small, but some networks provide more than others. Google Adsense and Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide (related to Yahoo!) are well-known ad networks. Furthermore, there are also some networks not connected to these internet giants. In my blog in the sidebar and below and above the text of my blogs, I have pay per-click ads. Whenever one of my readers clicks on these advertisements, I receive a small amount of payment. The explanation for the ad works is that Google and Yahoo use cookies and web history data to target ads to things you probably want. The advertisements I see when I visit forums, for example, usually contain Kate Spade, Maurices or Amazon items that I recently watched. Such companies know which websites you visit and use these data directly to tailor the ads to you. Pay-per-click ads are typically one of the best ways to make money blogging when your blog starts. That's because, irrespective of traffic, Google Adsense and Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide support only any website (so long as you don't have banned materials, such as porn or something). Most beginners make money blogging from day one with this sort of publicity. But the drawback is that your blog can look embarrassed and just earn money while harming the ad user's experience. Specific ads and sponsored posts You should start looking for direct advertising after your blog has been around a while and a reasonable amount of traffic. Many businesses can even reach you through your contact page. Such corporations and brands pay for placing a \"banner ad\" on your website or for promoting an article on your blog. FTC guidelines say that you must report if a blog post is funded and reputable companies are in agreement. Yet bloggers are also asked all the time to host supported contents without any \"spammy\" client reports. Such companies only want to get a connection from your website. You really don't know if someone sees your content or clicks your connection. Instead, they use Google's rating only to boost their own. This is contradictory to the recommendations of Google and the FTC. If you're caught doing this, your website could be disciplined inside Google's ranking system. This will drive you down the search engine results list and have a negative effect on your amount of traffic from search engines. Bloggers may expect to be provided throughout the board for direct advertising, but for a limited period of time, usually one year, this is done at a flat rate. Spam companies are going to try and get bloggers to publish their contents and send them a $10-20 connect. You can up to $200 for one link if you have a high-ranking blog. Legitimate businesses are willing to pay more, and may give you several hundred or even several thousand dollars for traffic on your blog, particularly if you are promoting them on social media, emailing your list, or endorsing multiple posts on your web. Affiliate Marketing Another way to blog money is through affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is when a blogger is paying to buy something by using a connection to their website. Instead of pay-per-click ads where the blogger is only paying for your ad click, you usually have to buy something for the blogger to receive payment. You have to join affiliate programs to make money from affiliate marketing. Many organizations have their own individual programs for which you have to apply. Nevertheless, there are also affiliate networks, such as Commission Junction, Share-a-Sale or Amazon Associates, where many companies and products can be found on your blog. After you have entered an affiliate program, a special connection with a special tracking code is issued. It can be used in a blog post, in social media or online shop. If anyone uses your connection to buy something, a portion of the profit is paid to you. How much can you do with affiliate marketing? Depending on the company with which you operate and what the reader is purchasing, the amount will vary significantly. On every single sale, bloggers will earn a few cents or a few hundred dollars. Different companies will offer their clients different percentages. To order to increase the volume of affiliate sales, bloggers typically write a review of a product or a guide to several products. Those allow readers to buy something because they already have faith in you. Reviews can also draw search engine traffic for individuals who are looking for a product they already think about buying. Some bloggers know they must be cautious with the ads of sponsors so that they don't harm their followers. Most bloggers are therefore only going to promote stuff if they have experienced them. Affiliate marketing advantages There are a variety of really good things about affiliate marketing. Next, you can write a single blog post, create a website and share it for years on social media and keep making money from it. Your tracking code usually works for a couple of days. If a reader clicks on an Amazon link on your blog post, anything they buy in Amazon for the next few days, will be credited to your website as a sale, even if it is not your particular product. ",

            "answer_text": "Bloggers use a number of different techniques to monetize their websites. Here are a few examples;  1). Advertisement Bloggers place advertisements on their blogs. Although revenue per click is very low, if your blog generates a substantial amount of traffic it can be very profitable. However, with too many ads you risk annoying your users. 2). Affiliate Marketing This is where you refer the user to a product from a third party, such as Amazon. If the user purchases the recommended product you receive a small percentage of the revenue. This is in my opinion one of the most profitable techniques, especially if you can recommend high price items. 3). Offering a Service If users are getting value from your work then why not charge additional services out. Many bloggers turn into paid consultants on their niche. If you have a solid loyal user base then why not offer additional content for a cut. There is no clear winner in terms of monetization strategy, what method works best is unique to the blog. Often blogs will implement multiple monetization strategies and that can be valuable. What is important is you do not spam your users with monetization, build a user base based on quality information and then slowly implement monetization. You will earn nothing without respecting your audience. Hope that helps. I am happy to answer any additional questions you may have. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. You had some big buys telling how you make the big bucks. Now, let me tell you realistically how you can making money with a blog. Before that, let me tell you something: it is very hard to make a living out of a blog. After 12 months of blogging, I generated a net profit of $2184.73. The good news is that if you have some talent, you write well, and you\u2019re willing to work your butt off, blogging offers the highest odd at creating a hell of a business. Again, I think that you\u2019ll need to know a lot of technical stuff, have a lot of connections and a bit of luck to be a successful blogger. I am not sure if there is a business with such low starting up costs and earning potential. You can buy reliable hosting for under $4/mo these days. I have leveraged my blog to escalate my consultancy business and sell my book. My private consulting business did more than a thousand bucks last month alone and virtually every lead came from my blog. If you liked this post, follow me on Quora and on Facebook for more. ",

If you don\u2019t have a product or service at the moment, you should have your eyes open to become an affiliate of a system which would then enable you to resell there product.If this is not what you\u2019re looking for then you\u2019d have to build up your blog until a certain daily traffic volume that it would be lucrative for a company to advertise on.

Currently, I\u2019m receiving a few thousand people a month in traffic and am making about $5 a month in ad revenue.Right now, I\u2019m focusing on building up traffic to increase this revenue. One downside of using Google AdSense is Google determines which ads it will display for you. While Google AdSense is very convenient and easy, the ads might not be exactly what you want to show for your viewers.Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is a great way to monetize a blog. There are numerous affiliate sites (Flex Offers - Affiliate Programs for example) which have partnered with many companies. Also, there are programs, such as Amazon Affiliates and ShareASale, which are more specific in the product you are linking to.Michelle, who blogs at Making Sense of Cents - A Personal Finance Blog, makes over $100k a month from affiliate marketing!You can see how I\u2019m using affiliate links on my recommendations page.To be more specific on the types of pay-outs, if someone clicks on the SoFi link and refinances their student loan, I get a flat $300. If someone clicks on the Amazon links and buys something, I get 4% of the total sale.Your own product (eBook, Merchandise, Course, etc) or Service (Consulting, Coaching, etc)Do you have any interest in writing an eBook, selling merchandise, or creating an e-course for your viewers? What about providing a service and charging for your time? These are both great ways to monetize a blog and turn it into a business!I\u2019m writing an ebook currently and looking at other bloggers for inspiration and marketing help.Subscription ServiceThe concept of \u201cIf you pay me $20 a month, I will give you exclusive content!\u201dTo successfully do this, you need to have great free content and great premium content to justify the subscription fee.I haven\u2019t personally explored this route, but I have a business partner who has and believes it\u2019s a fantastic route to take (again, given you have great content). Also, passive income is amazing, and this income will be recurring as long as the people stay subscribed.All this being said, it isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve been blogging for a few months and only just made my first $100. I\u2019m learning a lot though and it\u2019s a great experience. It will only grow from here!

This way, you can work backwards and \u2018chunk down\u2019 the steps required to reach your goal.e.g. Goal = Make $1000 per month from blog Weekly Target = $200 , Daily Target = $30 How to Reach $30 /day : Need to sell 3 x $10 products per day OR sell 1 x $30 product OR have 300 x .10 cent clicks (adsense) There are some bloggers who have spreadsheets that tell them how many posts they have to make on what platforms to get them their desired income. ( I will see if I can find one I used to use and add it) You can always look at google trends to see what is trending so you can make a blog around the latest and greatest trends. Hope this helps ",

Write consistent & quality contentCreate a keyword strategy. I use google keyword planner & ubersuggest, although there are many more resources for creating good keywords for your blog pages and posts. Social Media posts - create a schedule for promoting your content online. I use buffer to automate a few of my posts.

            "answer_text": "It is about content and content and better content. Your content connects you with your followers ( not to be confused with fans). These people consume your articles because they can relate with your message. May it be something \u201cfun\u201d or something serious. You made this connection and with that connection people will accept your message. The more acceptance the more views or readers of your blog. There is not one formula fits all but there is a pattern you can discern as a while of being in \u201cmarket\u201d. No amount of gimmicks will sustain one long term. There are so many horror stories of good people falling into debt just because they kept travelling or dinning out or buying luxury items to post on their blogs and they never get noticed by sponsors. I know one woman who went around the world posting lovely pictures. She wasnt bad at all but some how she failed to connect with her target audience\u2026 and she was in the thousands of dollars in debt. She spent enough money to buy a small house somewhere. But the endorsement money never came. So if I were you and you are a bit open to suggestions in a serious way. Try blogging first without the thought of earning later. That goal is simply distracting many talented bloggers. Write what you love to speak or write about. Also learn from others. No one has the monopoly of knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "To become a blogger, you need to learn how to write engaging, informative content for your readers. When writing a blog post, you need an outline, something like this: Blog Post Outline Message\u2014What you want to communicate to your readers.Title\u2014The title of your blog post. It should grab attention and reflect what your post is about. Thd job of the title is to get the reader to read the first sentence.Opening sentence\u2014The opening sentence also has to get the reader\u2019s attention. The job of the opening sentence is to get the reader to read the next sentence.Closing Sentence\u2014This is the last sentence of your post. It should leaver your reader with satisfying closure. I like to re-iterate my blog post title or opening sentence here, bringing the blog post full circle. This isn\u2019t always possible, but it\u2019s an effective way to end a post.Opening Paragraph\u2014Introduces the subject matter you\u2019ll be writing about. The last sentence of this paragraph should lead the reader in to the body of the blog post.Closing Paragraph\u2014Summarizes the topics covered in the body. This is where you write any conclusions you have with respect to the subject matter.Body\u2014The main part of the blog post. This is where you create at least two or three topics related to the subject matter, then write about them in detail. You can have as many topics as you want in this section.You may have noticed the order of the outline looks jumbled. This is intentional. By following the order in which each part of the outline is written, you clarify what it is that you want to tell your readers. When you sit down to write the main part of the blog post, it will be much easier. You will also be pleased with the results. I use this approach on all blog posts, whether my own or for a client. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "In her own words, Kimra Luna\u2019s childhood life was just \u201chorrible\u201d. But perhaps that\u2019s an understatement. If you listen to her interview, you will not find suitable words to describe it. Nothing can explain what this young, beautiful girl had to go through during her childhood. Yet she endured it all and became one of the most sought after internet entrepreneurs, business strategists, bloggers, speaker and influencer.  Photo Credit: Kimra Luna | Facebook What would normally be described as a normal day, was a day littered with domestic violence and chaos. She would even be afraid of going to school because people would taunt her as weird, abnormal and gay. All types of racist remarks would be thrown at her. It was living hell both inside her home and outside. When you listen to her inspiring story, you reasoned within yourself, \u201chow does someone still get the courage to live happily when her childhood was littered with so much violence, abuse and chaos? How can someone go through so much and still make it in life?\u201d Well, Kimra Luna is not your ordinary girl. She was a dreamer, right from the start, and no amount of garbage thrown at her would even for a moment, make her flinch from her lifelong dream of getting out of poverty and living her dream life. Although everyone else at home was unhappy, she decided from early on, that she would be different. At age 16 she frequented the library and borrowed books that would later prove to be invaluable in her future career. One such book that greatly influenced her was \u201cHow To Win Friends and Influence People\u201d by Dale Carnegie. She insists that her childhood was not something she would wish on anyone. She grew up in Boise, Idaho, in a family plagued with sexual abuse, physical abuse, verbal and mental abuse and a string of drunken father figures moving in and out of her life, whose abusive behaviors painted a stark picture of how cruel the world can be. She was physically abused by her own mother repeatedly, sexually molested by close family members and almost beaten to death by her eldest brother. For Kimra Luna, she had only one wish\u2014to get the hell out of Idaho, escape from her family, escape from poverty\u2014and run away from all those horrible people who were responsible for her hurt. That opportunity came when she had her first foray into business filling a local, albeit unique, need in her hometown, Idaho\u2014booking punk rock bands. She checked the CD jackets of her favorite bands and started cold emailing. And sure enough, within weeks she was booking legendary punk rock bands, whom she accompanied on countrywide tours. This crazy stint somehow made her a cool $90,000 a year. That stint took her to California, where she continued doing her thing, but unfortunately, the stint didn\u2019t last long. While working, one of her close business associates swung her a surprise and raped her. That was something she didn\u2019t expect, and it took her by storm. Her life fell apart and from then on, she couldn\u2019t concentrate any longer. Business went down, and, eventually, she had to close down. The year was 2008 and this was in the middle of the economic downturn. In her own words, she says that she was even thankful the economic collapse happened, because it gave her the much needed break. She decided she had had enough. Shortly after, she met and fell in love with a wonderful guy who became her husband, and the father of her three children. She found herself a married mom of two kids (they had only two kids by then). Neither spouse had a college degree or a job, so they found themselves living on welfare for the next four years with her husband's parents in Southern California. With no money, and raising two kids on welfare, life was tough, and the pressure was just too much. Finally, her husband got a good job with FedEx, which culminated into a journey across the country to Virginia. In a way, this was the only option to get off of welfare. With no friends or family, she became a stay-at-home mom living in Virginia. Inevitably, she drifted into boredom. She got so bored that she decided to search the internet about the possibility of starting a blog. Being crazy about health and wellness, she wanted to start a blog about vegan food for mommys. Using her iPhone to research and follow health and wellness blogs, she came across many blogs about food and wellness, and that kind of intrigued her. So she said, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do that. I\u2019m just going to become like a blogger.\u201d So she decided to ask her husband to buy her an iMac from a tax refund that came back, and he said, \u201cOkay\u201d. So they spent all the money on an iMac, although she didn\u2019t even know how to use a Mac computer. She had only used a PC her whole life and this was many years back, so this was like a whole new adventure for her. She decided to learn everything she could about blogging, and how to start and grow an online business. She would Google things like, \u2018how to start a blog\u2019, \u2018how to start a successful online business\u2019, and things like that\u2026 This introduced her to people like Pat Flynn, James Wedmore, Rick Mulready, and others\u2014online entrepreneurs who greatly influenced her career and her life. She started following them from day one. So she said, \u201cAll right, I think I\u2019m going to write about health and wellness stuff and things like that\u201d, but she also wanted to make money. \u201cWhen I first started, I had to do everything on limited time, because I had my two little ones. I also was homeschooling [the children] and my husband was working a full time job, between eight to ten hours a day.\u201d \u2014 Kimra Luna. When the the kids went to sleep, she would work on her business. Nine to midnight was her time to educate herself to \u2018grow her business\u2019. As she tells it, \u201cit was a constant streaming of keeping knowledge and inspiration buzzing in her ears.\u201d She spent countless hours listening to podcasts and audio books, like Think Rich Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill or law of attraction tapes by Abraham Hicks. \u201cWhen I started learning about the law of attraction and started studying\u2026 wow. Like\u2026 I can create my life! And I started going down that path.\u201d, she states.[1] She built her online business in the evenings and weekends. She grew her blog to 100,000 unique viewers a month without paid traffic, using only Pinterest, Facebook group and YouTube. She ended up with a large following on her blog, Facebook group and YouTube, just sharing life, health and wellness. By then, she didn\u2019t even have what you may call a business or a brand. She happened to come across a network marketing company that was selling organic health products so she thought that she could grow her network by blogging about the products and also sell the products to her Facebook audience. Her network grew quickly due to her online audience until the company started noticing. However, as the network started growing, the company was not happy with her marketing and recruitment strategy. In addition, they were not comfortable with her hair style (her hair is dyed pink colour along with nose piercings). Besides, the company had a crappy compensation plan, and the pay was poor considering the hard work she was putting into it. Eventually, she had to part ways with the company. She ended up stripping the blog off of the company\u2019s products and replacing it with her own content. Meanwhile, she had grown her audience to a whopping 20,000 members on her Facebook group and over 2,000 email subscribers. By then, her audience were asking for coaching and teaching lessons about how to start and grow a Facebook group and how to start a successful online business. So she started building an online business around that. Leveraging her blog audience, Facebook and YouTube, she decided to launch an online course teaching people what she knew about growing a successful online business, blogging, branding and creating Facebook Ads. That business made her almost $1,000,000 in sales in her first year. She went on to build a successful business and a brand that made her an instant hit around the internet. She started doing webinars and launching training programs, and her audience continued to grow. She also started appearing on magazines and blogs like HER, HuffingtonPost and BusinessInsider. From there, her business just took a dramatic turn. She went from under $1 million to over $1.5 million a year by 2016. Now she\u2019s doing almost $3 in sales per year. Kimra Luna is a personal branding and online business strategist. She helps freedom-seeking entrepreneurs to stand out, captivate their audiences\u2019 attention and monetize their authentic brands online. From a standing start in May 2014, she\u2019s grown her email list and combined social media followings to over 200,000 people. Online entrepreneurs widely regard her Facebook group, The FreedomHackers Mastermind, as one of the most supportive places on the internet. Kimra is the creator of Be True, Brand You, her signature online program which has over 1500 students currently enrolled.[2]  The writer is a blogger, writer, entrepreneur and life coach.

And money also will only come when you blog in a way that it adds value to your blog visitors. Thinking of how to make money from the onset will only dwindle your focus and motivation when you start seeing those heartbreaking 50 pageviews stats. The best approach to Blogging is- focus on creating value by solving other people's problems with your blog posts; because only then can money be made. But while planning your blog strategy, you have to add the strategy you intend to make money from with your blog. Whether it is via adsense, affiliate marketing, sponsored post publishing and so on. But the laid down strategy should only come to play when you have created value with your blog by publishing value rich blog contents that not only appeal to your blog visitors but also help them solve a particular problem in their lives.

This research before you start building your blog can help you generate free traffic from the search engines and is well worth taking some time over. Blogging is a slow strategy to build multiple streams of traffic to a website. If you plan on monetising a blog, it\u2019s also worth finding a suitable product or range of products to sell. Ideally use Recurring Commission Affiliate Programs which match an area which is of interest to you. Recurring commission programs pay you over and over for each single sale. Blogging takes time and effort too so you should choose a topic which you\u2019re happy to write content around for several months or years. If you pick an topic which is unknown to you, it\u2019s much harder to sustain an interest in creating content for it for the duration of time it will take to make it successful.

            "answer_text": "It depends how much work you want to put in, how/what niche your website is, and what your traffic is like. AdSense is a remnant ad network. There are many others. You may just want to experiment which one gives you the best earnings. You can try alternative forms of monetization, like affiliate text links (VigLinks, etc) or lead gen programs. It depends on your niche. For example, if you focus on a specific type of photography and reviewing the relevant equipment, your traffic is probably on your site because they want to buy that equipment. So they might buy a camera through your affiliate links and you'll make $50. You can try direct ad sales using tools like www.isocket.com /www.buyads.com (where I work), or some of the others listed here. Some niche publishers with decent traffic do very well. When you have an engaged and/or targeted audience, advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach them (in fact, it's called \"premium\" advertising). For example, we power a blog dedicated to voice over talent in Hollywood. Smaller traffic, but super niche and successful. You can see an example of ad rates niche sites are getting on www.buyads.com. There are websites about perfume, fixed gear hipster bikes, wedding planning, Midwest sports, how to survive on a budget in Brooklyn, etc. All niche, all do very well!! Get creative - with smaller traffic, you can get a higher ROI by using alternative forms like asking for donations, selling ebooks, swinging that audience into buying something / services from you, etc. ",

When it comes to blogs and their success, I would say it depends on what type of blog you're running. Cooking blogs have been all the rage the last few years, but unless it's super unique, it might get overlooked in the sea of similar blogs. To monetize those blogs, you could try: 1. The most obvious thing that most bloggers do is establish an Adsense account and hope they get enough traffic and clicks to live off of. Not the best and most secure approach. 2. You could do the web design for bloggers and make money doing that.  3. Do your homework and find some low competition keywords and create micro-niche sites. 4. If you're pretty good at making blogs, why not produce a video course How To Create A Wordpress Website 5. Alternatively, you could do the same thing but use a site like Slideshare and send people to some sort of offer. Ultimately, It would depend on how much you want to put into it. ",

            "answer_text": "Blogging is a great way of connecting with the world. If you have been using those traditional methods of making money from your blog, it\u2019s time to give a new vision and revise your Blogging business plan. Make some new tweaks, changes for design and marketing of your blog. Work hard to promote your blog and integrate new ways to earn from your blog. Which platform is the best choice? You can find lots of reviews with analysis of the major platforms (they even have free hosting). For a beginner, I would recommend Blogger, Medium or Tumblr. Within these, you can create your content, publish and gather the audience. That\u2019s it, just start writing! Don\u2019t want to have a blog like anyone else? If you want to customize your blog, try Squarespace or Weebly, where making your own characteristic blog or web page is possible even without learning HTML. In case your ideas are more demanding and need more integration \u2013 simply get a CMS (content management system) like WordPress, Drupal, WIX or Joomla. How to promote a blog? Comment on Other Blogs. Identify the top blogs which are similar to yours and start interacting and commenting on blogs on a regular basis.Prepare a Social Media Strategy. Create social media profiles and share your latest articles. Focus only on key social networks. Posting frequency should vary depending on the social media site. Some research shows that it is optimal to post twice daily on Facebook and three times daily on Twitter.Publish Regular Infographics. People love infographics, especially those that share important facts and statistics.Facebook groups can also be a good source of traffic and exposure for your blog.How to blog without losing motivation? Be Yourself. Start to express yourself. You can write about your hobby, passion and work on a personal level. Every person is unique, and your story is an important one. By writing about yourself and your experiences, you will always be motivated and you will always have a ready content.Build a writing habit. Write and add new content at the page at the same time every day.Prepare a list of topics. In the beginning, we always have more ideas. Our head is fresh and it's easier for us to come up with a new idea, to create a list of all ideas. At the moment of crisis related to the lack of motivation, you will be able to use that topic.Now, all you have to do is to start monetizing your blog. Start it soon! ",

That is possible if you are ready to take your blog to a level where you get reasonable number of visitors. In short what i mean to say is that traffic matters and you won\u2019t have traffic until you are backed ( back links) by high quality blogs in your niche. So work on building a blog that attracts reasonable visits ( min of 200 visitors per day) and then approach Ad-sense to start earning money. But don\u2019t expect thousands in few months, no. Rather build audience towards your blog and believe me if you start following money you won\u2019t make it however if you start building value for users, money will naturally follow you\u2026 Lastly and honestly please be informed i wont tell you go for affiliate marketing and others money making means because such methods wont work until you have traffic in thousands per day..

            "answer_text": "How to earn money from your blog in 2020 Earning money through blogging should not be your priority. Of course, you have to work hard for it. Before heading towards selling, make sure how beneficial your blog is to the readers. It can be in the form of providing freelancing services, offering an online course, or it can be anything. 1.Freelancing You can easily use your blog to present your skills and expertise. Many companies are always looking for freelancers to outsource. Your blog will be an example of your work in front of them. 2. Affiliate Programs You receive some advantages your audience and viewership are increased. One of the benefits is affiliated programs. These programs are launched by famous companies and bring a whole network related to your niche. This keeps your audience hooked to your blog. It also helps them in presenting the products in which your readers might be interested in. Your blog post can be sponsored as well. Yes, you heard it right. You can charge a handsome amount from top brands to support the blog post. 3. Sponsored Blog Content In general, it is where you pay a fee for a brand, company, or person to have their material (or offering) in the form of a blog endorsing before your audience. This means that, before you can broker a paid content contract, you will actually need a main reading base because the distributor needs the followers to press and at least consider the exclusive offer you are writing about. 4. Online Courses You can also offer an online course. If you have some skill, why not teach it to others. Online teaching is trending these days. You can provide several packages like basic, intermediate, and premium, including tutorials, video lectures, and presentations. You can also place ads on your blogs. It is a sort of joint venture and helps you to earn in less time. The podcast can also be launched on your blog. It is merely for the people who are interested in the niche of your blog. 5. Traditional Blog Advertisements Many famous bloggers earn $1,000 a million from different membership in this ad network, with about 300,000 to 500,000 monthly readers. Many other ad networks offer slightly higher CPC (cost per click) and CPM rates, but they are not restricted by the kinds of brands and products that I may advertise on my site, so I have opted to take fewer revenues to stick with the types of brands I want to promote on my site. 6. Podcast Sponsorships Another great way to monetize your blog is by launching a (simple) podcast ... and using your traffic and early listener statistics to get out and sponsorship brands to reach your readers and hearers. In fact, you can combine podcast ad placement offers with sponsored blog posts for sweetening the deal on your site. My favorite thing about podcasts is that it gives me an excuse to interview a few of my most exciting professionals. It may be relatively easy to start interviews, depending on the niche you are blogging. ",

            "answer_text": "How can one make money starting a blog How to Start a Blog: Step-by-Step Okay, if I haven't dissuaded you just yet, and you're serious about launching the next Mashable or TechCrunch or whatever other blog you might think is wildly successful in your eyes, then here's what you need to do in a step-by-step fashion. The more you prepare and plan, the more likely you'll be to succeed in the long term. 1. Pick a Topic Get clear on what you'll write about. Define a topic or niche, and design all your content around those things. This will help you to not only laser-focus your writing, but also to build digital products and services that compliment your content. This allows you to attract customers in, enticing them with your highly-informative posts, then tempting them with a lead magnet before dropping them into your sales funnel (more on that shortly). 2. Select a Platform While Wordpress is the most popular platform for blogging by far, there are others out there that can be leveraged such as a micro-blogging platform like Tumblr, Blogger.com and even Medium. Custom domain names are important if you're serious about making money from the blog you start. Rather than relying on a third-party-hosted subdomain, find a short but relevant keyword-rich (if possible) domain name that's descriptive of your intended topic, industry or niche. Use BlueHost, HostGator, 1&1 Hosting or any other number of domain name providers to source your domain. If you're at all concerned about things like SEO, when selecting your domain name, you should adhere to the following suggestions: Use a known top-level domain (TLD) such as .com or .netKeep the domain short, no more than 15 characters or soTry not to purchase a domain name with hyphens, since they're more often associated with spammersAvoid using self-hosted subdomains to rank or categorize posts4. Find a Good Web Hosting Company There are loads of good hosting companies out there. If you're starting a Wordpress, self-hosted blog, there are a near-endless amount of options. The important thing is to do your due diligence and pick the right one that's suitable to your budget and to ensure that the service-level and up-time guarantee is there. At the beginning, you'll likely want to start out with either a Managed Wordpress solution or a Virtual Private Server (VPS), and scale from there. Eventually, you'll probably need a dedicated-hosting solution with a CDN (below) once you break through a few thousand visitors per day. 5. Caching and Content-Delivery Networks (CDNs) Use a system like W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache and turn on browser caching to ensure that you speed up the delivery of your webpages. In the beginning, this might not seem as important. But as you grow and your traffic increases to thousands of visitors per day, this will be critical. Use Google\u2019s page speed insights to test things before and after the installation. It's also important that you setup a CDN, which will speed up the global delivery of your content. For example, your page might load relatively quickly in the United States, but what happens when someone in Australia tries to load your content? CDNs replicate data across multiple repositories around the world, and make content delivery ultra-fast. This is important for the user's experience because most people who are foced to wait even a few seconds for a page to load, often abandon the website and go to the next one in the search results. W3 Total Cache integrates with Amazon's AWS and MaxCDN, two very good options when it comes to CDNs. 6. Enable Permalinks In Wordpress, you should enable permalinks before getting things off the ground, which will give you nice canonical URLs that are SEO-friendly. Permalinks are located within the settings > permalinks section of your Wordpress admin and select the post name option. 7. Install the AMP plugin The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an initiative by Google to speed up mobile accessibility to a large degree of their content. The AMP specification, which you can read more about here, helps to thin down a webpage to its basic structural components with scaled-back JS and minified CSS code, makes for lightning-fast page speeds. 8. Install Google Analytics Install Google Analytics so that you can keep track of your efforts while building out your blog. This is a great way to keep track of your results while using the URL campaign builder when dropping links in social media and other places so that you can effectively determine where your traffic is coming from. 9. Setup Google's Webmaster Tools Anyone who's serious about building a blog and making money, needs to leverage Google\u2019s webmaster tools to see what keywords they're ranking for and any messages that would impact their ability to rank. This will also allow you to submit an XML sitemap and track keyword impressions along with click-through rates. This is one of the most useful tools for growing your site or blog through constant analysis of your efforts. 10. Learn SEO the Right Way Although you shouldn't start a blog with the intention of optimizing it to oblivion, you most certainly should understand the fundamental principles of search engine optimization so that you pay attention to the key aspects that will impact your ability to rank on search engines like Google. Begin with, and digest and implement that information. Learning SEO is a long and drawn out journey. You should always be increasing your knowledge and expanding your skill set. 11. Regulary Build Useful Content If you're serious about succeeding with your blog, you need to build useful anchor content. It needs to be engaging, keyword centric, insightful, unique and well written. Don't write your content for search engines. Rather, write your content for humans while also paying homage to search engines and what they want. Simply put, it's a skill that develops over time with practice. It's also important to regularly publish your content on a weekly basis. 12. Sign Up to an Email Marketing Platform The best avenue for making money from your blog is through email marketing, plain and simple. Hands down, this offers one of the quickest and surest strategies for earning an income through your blog. But before you get there, you need to sign up to an email marketing platform like Aweber, ConvertKit, MailChimp, Constant Contact, InfusionSoft or any other number of platforms that exist out there. 13. Build a Lead Magnet If you're serious about marketing anything online, rather than opting for running ads on your blog (which won't make you real money unless you have at least hundreds of thousands of visitors per day) or engaging in affiliate marketing, you should build a topical lead magnet that will sell a digital product or offer that you create in the back-end. The lead magnet will entice people to sign up to your list and provide you with their email address. 14. Build a Digital Product and Position Your Offers Email marketing and lead magnets are all designed to help you build out an automated sales machine. However, you need a digital product, service or other kind of offer in the back-end to do that. You can create multiple offers or products, that can lead people up a value chain towards your high-ticket sales. 15. Create a Sales Funnel Take the time to build your automated sales funnel. There is so much involved with sales funnels, but the basic premise is that your visitors will show up to your site by discovering your content, drop into your sales funnel through an offer via your lead magnet or some other tripwire, and they'll then be led through a journey with drip-fed messages at some periodic schedule that will allow you to sell your products and services on autopilot. 16. Get Social Building a blog isn't easy by any measure. To help you along the road towards success, you have to get social. Not only by linking up with other like-minded bloggers interested in online marketing, but also by sharing and engaging with others on social networks like Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms. 17. Market Your Content The single most important strategy you'll find for building up a blog and boosting your visibility on search engines like Google, and my all-time go-to strategy for rocketing up the search rankings on Google's SERPs, is content marketing. Marketing your content is an intricate process that involves long, seemingly-never-ending hours of building more useful off-site content that links to your primary anchor content, but it's well worth it. You can use this single strategy to rank number one on Google's searches for nearly any keyword if it's done the right way. There's most certainly an art to this as well as a technical outline and to doing it the right way. Don't try to spam or overstuff keywords in an effort to market your content by any means. 18. Monetize Your Content Let's face it, starting and running a blog can get costly. Don't expect to get rich overnight. However, you can take certain measures to monetize some of your content along the way. Be sure that you remain topical with your content and that your lead magnets help to drop people into a sales funnel that will eventually sell your high-ticket items. However, aside from that, you can always opt to generate small amounts of cash flow by doing other things such as creating articles that will lead people to courses or audiobooks that you've developed, or building out video tutorials that will ultimately sell some big package or system that will help to teach people whatever it is that you're really good it. There are numerous ways to monetize your content and make money from your blog, but don't try to take shortcuts along the way. Don't look for the fast-buck if you're serious about your long-term results. Take action and stay persistent if you want to succeed and achieve your. BONUS TIPS: Writing a blog post from scratch is hard, staring at a blank page with no way to get started is what keeps most people away from writing content. That's why they can never get anything done on their website or write blog posts every day. But what if you did not have to start from scratch? Introducing 1-Click Blog Post.

You can ask yourself a question like; what is your field of expertise and what are you really passionate about it? or you\u2019re just becoming something because you want to earn money. I\u2019ve seen many bloggers, especially Indian bloggers starting with Blogging Tips,Tech, SEO, Making Money Online, Hacks and so on. But I highly recommend you to go with your passion rather than going to some unknown world. If you\u2019re passionate or love adventure then you can go with it. Because you can earn money through these kinds of blogs also. Second choosing a good domain and faster hosting. If you\u2019re looking to create a brand then go with something bold and unique domain name. In hosting, you can go with Hostgator, Bluehost, A2Hosting and Inmotion Hosting. If you have tight budget then select between Hostgator or Bluehost. Get familiar with your competitors and neighbors. It doesn\u2019t matter In what niche you\u2019re in. You will certainly find your competitors but rather than behaving like an aggressive competitor you should try to be their friend. You can join Facebook groups,Social Medias and forums these places are great to meet some like-minded people. Read more and learn more; Handpicked some blogs that you can read and can learn something from them. Write about the things that you\u2019re familiar with and not about those things that you\u2019re not aware of. Be very honest with your readers, always treat them like a friend and reply everyone who message you or comment you. Try to make a connection. Now come to the thing that is very important and can motivate you in your blogging journey, I\u2019m talking about \u201cMoney\u201d. From very first day you can place the ads or monetize your blog to start earning from your blog. Affiliate Marketing, Advertising, Donation(I\u2019m serious!) etc are great ways to monetize your blog in your beginning days of blogging. Focus on Single Traffic Source. Decide that from where you will get the traffic to your blog.Like from Social Media, Referrals, Commenting, Events (offline/online) or Search Engines. I recommend you to avoid search engines in your starting days because it takes time for a blog to pick up some authority. You can go for social networking sites, It\u2019s can be your very good source in starting. Join facebook groups, pages, tweet people, be creative on pinterest and meet people related to your industry etc. Let me know if you have any question in your mind via a comment. ",

I found a cool way to create a simple blog on blogger/blogspot and use it to drive traffic to that blog to earn money with CPA marketing and affiliate marketing. You must know that there is much more that goes into the making money process and is not just about having a blog. You have to understand certain things like psychology, mindset, and intent just to name a few. If your doing affiliate marketing, you will need to have an autoresponder and that can be a lot to learn. It can be easier to make money with this method if you do CPA marketing instead. CPA marketing is like affiliate marketing but without selling. You can earn money just for collecting emails, phone numbers or zip zodes. How to: sign up to CPA networks..find a good offer, create a simple blog on blogger for free then create a YouTube video or use creative commons to share other peoples videos. Rank the YouTube video, then send the traffic to your blog with your CPA offers or affiliate links without ranking in Google. TOPMAKEMONEYIDEAS ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your blog's business plan. There are multiple methods to generate revenue from your blog. Here are some of those models: If your blog's business model is to generate money from Google Ads, you place Google Ads and earn money from the Google AdSense program. In this model, Google pays you the money for displaying said ads.If your business model is to show sponsored ads of other brands and business, it can also work. In this model, you don't display Google ads on your blog. Instead, you display ads for other businesses and websites who pay you.You can also sell your services to other people on the web. Many people use blogging as a way to generate business leads for them. In this model, the blog doesn't directly generate money for you. Instead, it generate leads for you, and those business leads eventually pay you for your services. For instance, I'm a freelance writer and charge my clients for the writing services I offer them. Some of my clients find me through my blog.Affiliate marketing is another very popular business model on the web. In this model, you recommend someone else's product to your blog's audience. You help them make more sales and, in return, they pay you a specified percentage for each transaction.Another very popular (and perhaps the most profitable) way is to sell your own products to your blog readers. In this model, as you're directly selling products, your blog readers pay you in exchange for your product.There are several other methods to earn money from your blog. But these are the basic 5 business models. Hope it helped! ",

            "answer_text": "How To Make Money With A Blog: 7 Effective Methods  1. Choose the Niche 2. Create your Blog 3. Bring traffic to your site Methods of earning 1. Google Adsense 2. Advertising banners 3. Affiliations 4. Sell an info-product 5. Newsletter 6. Sell Guest Posts 7. Offer services or advice Conclusions If you follow in detail everything I will tell you in this guide, your chances of success will increase dramatically, but just neglect even one point and all your dreams could be shattered very quickly. Pay close attention to everything I will tell you and try to follow all the points in the guide step by step, only in this way you will be able to monetize your blog seriously 1. Choose the Niche This is by far the most important part of our entire journey. Many people often start a generic blog where they talk about their own business that nobody cares about. It is mathematically impossible to monetize such a blog unless you are already well known. To really be able to make money with a blog you have to choose a very specific niche in which you are particularly prepared. Don't talk about random topics just because they sell, you will only waste your time. Choosing the right niche today is fundamental, much more than in the past, but keep in mind that a topic is not a niche, but a part of that topic. I'll give you an example: Technology = Topic Smartphone = Niche iPhone = Specific niche The more specific you are in the topic you are dealing with, the more you will be seen well by users and by Google itself. A well-defined niche makes your life much easier at SEO level (if you don't know what it is we will get to it in a moment) and credibility, as you will be identified as an expert in the sector and this is something that everyone likes a little Each niche can bring earnings, the important thing is to be knowledgeable in the subject and does not take people for stupid, they will quickly realize if you are not really an expert in that sector and will tend not to frequent your blog anymore. If you don't know how to choose your niche try to take a look at my article where I talk about the various methods to start new businesses, you may have some inspiration. 2. Create your Blog I know it might seem obvious but if we really want to monetize our blog there are some precautions we must take to avoid getting in trouble later Once you've chosen your niche, let's start creating our blog. In this article, I will not explain how to create a blog, it would take too long, but I will limit myself to listing some precautions to be taken when creating it. Most blogs are powered by WordPress, perhaps the best tool out there, but there are others as well. Whatever platform you will use, try to respect these points: Buy fast and functional hosting Choose a simple but effective domain related to your niche Choose a professional theme The site must be optimized for mobile Optimize the site on the SEO side Write quality content Don't get scared by this list, it's all easier than you think. As for hosting it is essential to choose a quality one, very often we tend to overlook this aspect. If your site is based on a low-quality webspace, the whole site will be compromised. I recommend SiteGround and in this article, you can read my opinions on this hosting On SiteGround (or any other hosting provider) you will also choose the domain (among other things for free). As for the template, it is essential to choose a professional one so as not to encounter problems in the future, but also for better user experience on your site. On ThemeForest, you will find all the templates you want, already responsive, and optimized for SEO. If you don't know which one to choose, take a look at my article \" Professional WordPress Themes \". 3. Bring traffic to your site This is the only real obstacle to overcome, without traffic it is impossible to earn , I would lie if I told you that it is simple, it is not. So what do you need to do to get traffic to your site? Now I will list you a whole series of effective methods, but you will have to study them in detail one by one later if you really want to succeed in this undertaking. Here on my blog, you will find many detailed articles on every single topic. SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization which simply means optimizing a page for search engines. Why is SEO important? It is important to be able to get organic traffic that is in a natural (and free) way. Millions of people in Italy alone use Google every day to search for what they need, but honestly, how many of you have ever gone beyond the first page of results? SEO is for this; Try to optimize your article (but also the entire site) as best as possible so that Google notices you and decides to position you on the front page. Obviously, it is much easier said than done, the work of SEO is very complex and requires a lot of patience and determination, but if you decide to try your hand in this field you can get many advantages, and all for free. In summary, let's quickly see the advantages and disadvantages of this technique: PRO High-quality organic traffic Relatively constant over time Free VERSUS It requires a lot of experience It takes time Results not guaranteed SOCIAL NETWORK The first alternative to SEO are certainly Social Networks . Social networks have become an integral part of everyone's life, so you understand their potential very well. If you are particularly popular on one of these social networks, you can use this tool to your advantage to drive users to your blog. If, on the other hand, you intend to grow but you don't know how to do it, I suggest you read my guides in the social section. You can start with the one on Facebook titled \" How to be successful on Facebook \" PRO It does not require too much technical knowledge Free VERSUS It is not easy to grow up It takes time ADVERTISEMENT The last viable alternative to bringing traffic to your blog is \" advertisement \" or paid advertising. You've surely come across Facebook sponsorships or Google ads by now, well those are all paid ads People set a budget and pay a certain amount. (usually a few cents) every time someone clicks on their ad. The advertisement speech can become complex if your intentions are serious. I wrote a very detailed Facebook Ads guide ( Facebook sponsorships), but if you are a beginner, it may be a little too complex. PRO Receive instant traffic Traffic targeted for your industry VERSUS It is a paid service To do this optimally, you need a strategy Whatever the source of traffic you choose, the material on your blog must be interesting and of quality, in such a way as to grow the audience naturally over time. This is a prerogative present on all guides on how to make money with a blog. Methods of earning Once our blog has been created, we begin to evaluate all possible earning methods. In this section, I will list all the main methods of earning through a blog, from the simplest to the most complex ones that will allow you to earn even hundreds of euros a day. If you want to know more, read my article \" How to make money on the Internet \" Whether choosing one method or using them all together is up to you, it matters that they are used intelligently and functionally. 1. Google Adsense Google Adsense is by far one of the best-known methods. Registering on the platform is free and once you have filled in all the required fields, in less than an hour you will have the code for the banners to be implemented in your blog. Placed banners on your site you will receive a commission for each person who clicks on the ad. The commissions are variable, they depend above all on the type of ad, but let's say that in principle they vary on average from 0.10 cents to up to one euro per click. Not bad I would say. The nice thing about Goggle Adsense ads is that they are dynamic, meaning they change according to the user's interests. This greatly increases the chances of receiving clicks. PS. It is not possible to click your own ads, risk: ban from the service. 2. Advertising banners In addition to Google banners, it is also possible to insert \u201cproprietary banners\u201d on your blog, ie advertisements provided by the companies themselves. For example, if your blog talks about video games, a well-known video game manufacturer, or a store like GameStop could offer you to place their banner on your site in exchange for a fee. Obviously, you can also propose yourself to certain companies, the only requirement is to be able to guarantee a significant number of impressions, which means having a lot of traffic on your site. Nobody would agree to put banners on a site with little or no traffic. How much you earn with this kind of banner depends on the agreements made with the company itself. Some pay a fixed fee per month, others pay a certain amount. every thousand views. If your site enjoys a lot of organic traffic you can try to propose your site on specialized portals such as BuySellAds, companies, or individuals who will contact you directly from this platform. 3. Affiliations Affiliations are by far the best way to make money with a blog. But how does it work? It basically consists of promoting and selling someone else's product. An example above all is the Amazon affiliate program. Read also \" What is affiliate marketing and how it works \" Once you have registered for free, you can generate nominal links for each product you have chosen through the control panel and then insert it in your blog. You will receive a percentage every time someone clicks on your link and buys the product. (in the case of Amazon the commissions range from 5 to 10%). Nowadays it is possible to affiliate with almost all the major online stores, however, there are affiliate networks, full of companies and products to be promoted. The commission percentages vary according to the network or company and may even reach 75%, pretty much you earn more than the owner. To promote a product on your blog, just choose something relevant to your niche and then write a good article about it, perhaps a detailed review, in order to convince the user to click on the link and buy the product. There are also other types of affiliation such as those in CPA, or cost per action, where you will be paid for each action performed by the user and not for each sale. In most cases, it is a newsletter subscription or having downloaded an application. Here is a list of the main affiliate programs: Amazon, eBay, Ali Express, Max Bounty (CPA). If you intend to get serious in this field, then I highly recommend you access ROI Martin, one of the most advanced online courses in Italy where you can learn in practical terms how to do affiliate marketing and start making serious money. Seeing is believing. 4. Sell an info-product We've seen how to sell other people's products through affiliations, but why not use your blog to sell products created directly by us? If you are an expert in a sector, try creating a guide in an ebook or a video tutorial and then promote it on your blog. Here are some portals that allow you to sell product info online: Udemy, Skillshare, Envato, and Pi\u00f9ChePuoi. 5. Newsletter Believe it or not, the newsletter is still one of the most effective sales methods today. Through the newsletters, we can promote all the products seen previously, or you could make your contacts available on sites like Demi. There are several ways to create a targeted contact list in your industry, the most common being to offer something for free in exchange for the email. 6. Sell Guest Posts If your site is fairly authoritative then you may want to consider selling \" guest posts \", ie allowing other bloggers to write on your blog. Why would anyone pay to blog on your blog? Simple, because in this way it will get visibility, traffic, but above all a backlink to their blog, which will transfer the so-called \" link juice \". The prices for a guest post start from a few euros up to hundreds of euros, it depends a lot on the authority of your site and on the sector. Be careful not to overdo it though. 7. Offer services or advice So far we have seen methods on how to make money with a blog in a substantially passive way. Obviously your blog can very well act as an intermediary between you and potential customers, offering services or specialized consultancy in a particular sector. The trick is to create a quality site with quality articles, so as to attract the attention of users and encourage them to contact you for advice. Conclusions Being able to monetize your blog is not as easy as it seems, you have to work hard and always be focused on the goal. In reality, there are also other methods of earning but these are by far the most profitable and effective. To conclude I want to reveal a secret: Do you want to make money with a blog? Then don't think you have to make money with a blog! Trust works great. My advice is to start one step at a time and don't be in a hurry if your blog is of quality with time the first earnings will also arrive. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest thing to start doing is be sure to have not only great content, but a large quantity of great content. Once you\u2019ve established that there are many way to make money and it depends highly on what your blog is about on which route is best. For example, if you\u2019re blogging about sports, one option could be affiliate marketing with sports attire or equipment if it\u2019s for players. It also highly depends not only on your content, but who the followers of that content are. If you\u2019re talking about business and marketing, one way to make money could be through selling ebooks or other informational products summarizing and or expanding on your blog posts. If you\u2019re content is mostly humorous or some other form of escapism, then advertisements may be the best route. There\u2019s no one \u201cbest\u201d way. It depends on many external and internal factors and without those specifics it\u2019s very difficult to determine the best route to take. I hope this helps =) ",

First, you\u2019ll need to find an area that appeals to you that has a good audience. There should also be a multitude of different products that you could promote to that niche. Domain Name and Registrar: Then choose a good domain name and hosting provider. I suggest going to Quora and search: \u201cbest web host\u201d. Look through the results for your host search and study what others have to say before making your choice. You\u2019ll want reliability, accessible customer contact, fast speed at a low cost. As for a domain name register, I use NameCheap. WordPress: Naturally, you\u2019ll need a nice looking website and you should be posting content daily. I suggest using a WordPress site because it has many free choices for theme templates available if you\u2019re starting out. If you want to later change themes, the installation flexibility using WordPress is ideal. Social Media: Not only should you be posting on your website blog but on many social media sites. You\u2019ll develop a larger following and magnify the audience appeal. As with anything online, traffic is a key element and after many posts using keyword specific phrases in your vertical, this kind of search engine optimized targeting be attracting visitors. Monetization: Your entire site can be monetized by affiliate advertising. These are good affiliate marketing companies you should join: \u00b7 Warrior Plus \u00b7 Linkshare \u00b7 Clickbank \u00b7 JVZoo \u00b7 Amazon Associates \u00b7 CJ Affiliates by Conversant \u00b7 ShareaSale When your site become large enough even others sites will contact you and offer payment for their link placements.

While banner ads used to work, they simply don\u2019t convert any more. The click-through rates are low, the payouts are incredibly low, and when they click the advert, they leave your site (sometimes to a competitor). There\u2019s nothing to gain from them. Sure, they work well for large sites, but you\u2019re not them, so don\u2019t do what they do. They\u2019re tacky and make you lose trust and credibility with your readers. The best way you can make money, is to build an email list. Build trust, give a tonne of value, and gently nudge your readers to joining your email list. Then create paid content (like eBooks) and promote those eBooks to your mailing list. People on your mailing list already know who you are and trust you to some level. These people will be more willing to buy form you. ",

            "answer_text": "If you define BEST in terms of EASIEST\u2026. Then the answer is quite simple. For bloggers, the EASIEST way to make money off their blogs is to sell BACKLINKS. Of course, you have to make it look like it\u2019s part of CONTENT. Gone are the days when you can just drop a link on sitewide parts of your blog. You can easily make $500 a day doing this if your blog has the right SEO qualities. The hard part? Getting your blog to that level. You also have to be niche-specific. You can also make money as a professional blog starter. Why? A lot of bloggers out there, they just jump in with both feet. They say, I\u2019m going to make money blogging because so and so sold their website for $100,000. I know so and so is dumber than a box of rocks. So if I\u2019m smarter than him, I can make more money than he does. Whatever the case may be, people just jump into blogging with both feet. And guess what? After a few weeks or even a few days, they quit. In fact, according to the New York Times, more than 95% of all blogs fail. Now, you may be thinking to yourself that this is a disaster. Blogging is a waste of time. This is bad news. No. It\u2019s a golden opportunity. Those people who failed, do you think they wanted to get back in the game if they have some sort of assurance that at least they would set up their blog right? Of course, they would. But they don\u2019t know where to start. They don\u2019t even know where to begin or where to look for the solution. That\u2019s where you come in. You can make money starting blogs. Not operating them. Not cranking out content for them over the long haul. Just starting them. So, how do you make money as a blog starter? Well, first of all, you already know. Not all blog niches make money. So that\u2019s the first service or the first value that you\u2019re going to deliver. You pick winning niches that pay well. Second, you start the blog by setting it up. You get a domain, you get hosting, you install Wordpress, you install a theme. Also, you make money starting a blog by getting the initial keyword targets of your blogs. And this, of course, requires keywords research in your part. If you don\u2019t know how to do this, you can outsource this. There are a lot of companies you can outsource keywords research to like CognoPlus or others. They\u2019re actually a dime a dozen. So, you get your target keywords or your target niche that you know makes money. The next step is to generate content. At this stage, you also have a lot of options. The most obvious option, of course, is you\u2019re going to have to roll up your sleeves and write the stuff yourself. Now, if you\u2019re not all that motivated or you don\u2019t have the tone or level of expertise, no worries. You can hire expert writers like Gene Eugenio (depending on the niche, he can write cheap content for you). Or you can hire companies like Bulxter to produce lots of content for you for dirt cheap. If you want maximum control but you want to produce a lot but don\u2019t have the time, you can dictate stuff yourself. Source: How to write 20,000 words per day or more You just create outlines for all the keywords that you\u2019re going to target and then you just dictate from memory, based on your research. Then you ship it off to a transcriber. They transcribe and you pay them on a per audio minute rate. Actually, using human transcribers is the best approach because if you\u2019re going to use a Dragon NaturallySpeaking or some other software-based transcription system, it sucks. It takes a long time to train and even if you try to train it, the words still come out messed up. Also, you have to slow down so the software absorbs whatever it is you\u2019re saying. But doesn\u2019t that defeat the whole point? I mean, the reason why you want to speak really quickly is because you want to generate a tremendous amount of content in a very short period of time. All that gets flushed down the toilet when you have to speak slowly because the software has to pick up the right words at the right time to transcribe your speech. It\u2019s a waste of time. Go with a human transcriptionist. They\u2019re definitely worth the money. So, after you\u2019ve done that, you got a lot of content and then you promote these materials through your social media checklist. I\u2019m talking about Twitter, Facebook Groups, Facebook Pages, Facebook comments, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other places. Once that\u2019s done, then you can start to shop your site. Ideally, you should sell it once it starts generating a lot of traffic. But if you\u2019re in a rush, there are still people who would buy such blogs because you started it right. You started it on the right topic, you have the right content, and you already set it up to eventually get traffic from Google. That\u2019s how you make money as a blog starter ",

            "answer_text": "Affiliate programs are one of the best ways to make money online through your blog.  The main problem faced by bloggers to start with affiliate program is that they don\u2019t know which affiliate program is good for them and which affiliate program to choose from huge number of affiliate programs available online. There are few parameters you should consider when applying for affiliate programs to monetize your blog: Program should be relevant to your nicheIt is very important that you must select the product of affiliate program relevant to your blog niche. You should analyze what kind of traffic you get and choose the affiliate program according to your visitors so that your visitors will be interested to purchase the product. Try to promote new productsOne mistake most of affiliate marketers are doing is, they copy the product what others are promoting. This is a bad idea, as your blog will lack the freshness and uniqueness. Try to pick relevant affiliate product, which fits your niche, is awesome and very few people are promoting it. Flexible paymentThere is a myth that with high rates of payment you will earn more even if you get fewer clicks. Before choosing the right affiliate program for your blog check out the minimum payouts, referral commissions, terms and conditions etc. Know how they are going to pay you either with PayPal or Wire. Read about the affiliate program firstIt is very important to research about the affiliate programs before signing up. You should not register to any affiliate programs just because your friend suggested you for same. Check out few forums and know the customers reactions, read discussion boards. Know about their customer support and the mailing list. These things are generally ignored while choosing affiliate programs but these are very important. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 3 main ways bloggers make money. Advertising. This requires a high level of visits to your site, aka web traffic. The more people visit your site, the more they see the ads, and the more you get paid. You can use an advertising network, or sell direct advertising space to other companies. You can also sell advertising in the form of sponsored posts, where companies pay you to write a blog post or email about their company and/or product.Affiliate marketingWhen bloggers sell other people\u2019s products on their site and get paid commission on the sales, it\u2019s called affiliate marketing. This can be any kind of product - digital, service, or physical. Commission rates vary between 25\u201375%. Affiliate marketing can be as simple as Amazon affiliates, to more in depth, like ongoing referral fees for a particular service you use. This also comes down to a numbers game. The more people who visit your site, the more chances someone will purchase one of your affiliate products. The bonus here is that you can also send affiliate links through email to your email list, where your buy-in rate might be higher.Product salesMany bloggers sell their own products. This could be branded \u201cswag\u201d, such as mugs, bags, t-shirts, or calendars, etc. Or this might be physical handcrafts, like hand-lettered posters, clothes, or other things you might find on Etsy or at a craft sale. Or you might sell digital printables, such as checklists, planning sheets, and worksheets that help solve problems. One of the more popular items to sell for bloggers is an ebook. Just about every blogger out there will eventually write an ebook for sale. This can be anywhere from 20\u2013100 pages, depending on the experience of the blogger and the depth of the topic. Another popular item for bloggers to sell are e-courses. These are combinations of videos, text and worksheets that lead participants into solving a problem by following a step=by-step lesson plan. And many bloggers will offer services through their blog. Graphic design, coaching, and virtual assistance are the most common, but you can offer any service you can sell. Having a lot of traffic and a dedicated, growing email list is key to success with this kind of marketing.",

Fourth, offer it to them in some form and make money from it. Fifth, continue growing readers, maybe consider ads or sposorships.

            "answer_text": "There are certainly numerous ways that can earn you money as a blogger. Here are some of the conventional ways that you can easily find anywhere else and I am mentioning them here for a reason. Adsense or other ad-networks: Make a blog, write a few content, apply for adsense or other adnetworks. If you comply with all the guidelines, chances are the adsense might get approved. Whoa! now start earning money.Affiliate marketing via content: Write product reviews and place links through call to actions. Anytime, someone purchases that product from your link, you get paid. Easy, Ain\u2019t it?Freelancing: Write for others. There is a huge demand of content creators and you can get paid for writing content for others.And there are other ways also. Anyway, these aren\u2019t as simple as mentioned and here is why? Without traffic any ad-network can\u2019t make you money. So, prior to thinking of earning money via ad-networks, think of attracting traffic to your blog or website. The common mistake newbies do is to run behind adsense rather than thinking ways to improve the quality and bring in more targeted audience.Once you have the traffic, you can monetize it with numerous ways. So, traffic first.Customers are more aware now. They do window-shopping when it comes to purchasing online. So, the gist is the art of persuasion and giving value. So, if you opt for Affiliate Marketing, read some Psychology books and understand the buyers intent first.Having a portfolio to showcase works in this industry, Believe me, its somewhat hard to make a dent in this sector for a newbie unless you are exceptionally good.So, make a portfolio, you can always start with your own blog and then guest post on some other sites.In a nutshell, understand this: Any niche can be monetized. Just have the patience.Consistency is the key. Give it at least 6 months or longer.Have faith.Thank you. Best of Luck. ",

After you start gaining an audience, you could also consider using platforms like BuyMeACoffee and Patreon, where creators like you can recieve donations from your supporters. After you receive traction, you could consider placing ads on your site, through Google's AdSense, or you can also sell ad space to brands and organisations. Selling your products through your blogs is also an option. Online courses, ebooks are all fair game. Additionally, you can use affiliate marketing strategies, where you can sell products of other brands through affiliate links as well as create sponsored content. Happy blogging! ",

If you really drill down the blog\u2019s niche your are providing, you could rank on Google too. Most important issue is to do the keyword research before you start your blog. Find long tailed keywords with very little competition but also have a healthy monthly search of 1000+ a month. You never know, you just might hit a niche were you have some success. In a nut shell you can earn off affiliate sales and a small amount from Adsense. Hope it works out and best of all, it won\u2019t cost you anything on all the platforms mentioned as they are all free.

There are many places where you can start your blog. Quora, Wordpress, Tumblr, Instagram are few examples of blogging sites.

For instance, if your blog is about Star Wars saga, you can try to advertise star wars memorablia, or figurines etc, from likes of ebay and amazon, with affiliate codes attached. If and when people buy these by clicking on your lin ks, you make commission. But again conversion rate is less than 1% in these situations if you have a 1000 monthy uniqe visitors, consider them buying less than 10 items per monet and let\u2019s say they spent $20 per shopping, you may be able to scrape a measly $1 per sale, which makes about $10 or less per month.

And the best solution for that is Google AdWords and Facebook Adverts. Don't go for any particular keyword in this way you will restrict your content around one topic only, your main theme is technology, so write whatever you like to, write about Android, Microsoft, hardware, software etc. and let these Advertising platforms take care of the rest. But do setup a subscription system on your website, in this way you can re-tain those precious visitors which you got by Advertising. At the same time, monetize your website with Chitika, Qadabra etc., they will make up for atleast 30%-40% of your advertising costs. But oh! did i forgot to mention? No matter what, content is king. You will not survive, if you failed to provide quality content to your readers. Here's your dream summary :  Start with a budget of $500 for advertisingProvide Quality and Regular contentAdvertise for 50 days ($10/perday)You will earn $100+ from (Qadabra and Chitika)After 50 days, apply for Google Adsense (but i think you are already approved by Adsense).By the 50th day, you would have noticed a natural increase in your organic/social/direct traffic.Now it's time to monetize this natural traffic coming from the audience you had built from past 50 days.Happy Earnings :)But i would still repeat, content is king.Don't step into advertising if you are not willing to be consistent about providing quality content to your readers.

It started as a parenting blog (over 7 years ago) but has morphed into a lifestyle-focused blog (with posts about travel, parenting and blogging/marketing) over the past few years as my kids are getting older. My best advice is that blogging is a long-term game. You aren't likely to make much money when you first start so focus more on growing a TRUE readership that likes, knows and trusts you. ALSO, start an email list right away - having the ability to reach out directly to your readers (even if you only have 10 subscribers!) is gold! ",

There's no doubt that making money should a part of your \"long term\" plan blogging, but giving your audience something worthwhile first should be the priority. Once you've done that then I would start to slowly look to monetize your blog and content and disclose to your visitors that you are trying to earn money through methods such as affiliate links, reviews and other offers that you'll be writing about and advertising on your blog. That transparency will help build trust just as I've mentioned on my Blogging Tips blog. Develop a privacy policy page that discloses that you'll be earning money as well. Your audience will be more inclined to buy from you when they know that you're not solely focused on pushing items to make money off of them as well. ",

Simplest way is to put Google ads or other ads on your blog. But for this, you need to have good traffic from search engines. Otherwise you are not going to get good income. Daily users are not going to click on ads. Most of the successful bloggers are using affiliate marketing for better revenue from blog. This is because on blog, you will have various readers who trust on your recommendations. So, you can recommend them to buy products from your affiliate links. Foe every sale, you will get commission. Hosting companies and themes companies pay good commission. Amazon is also a good place to start affiliate marketing. But be sure to recommend only good product. If you will recommend good products, people will come back for your recommendations. Few companies also pay bloggers for writing articles about their products and give dofollow backlinks. But I never recommend this way of earning money. By selling a dofollow link, you will put you and advertiser both in danger just for few bucks. Google will surely penalize you some day. You can also sell your own goods on your blog. You can sell ebooks, themes or services and get paid. ",

It is an option though. Another option would be to build an email list by offering something for free and then later use the list as prospects to buy whatever you're selling. Another option would be to build a huge following and a Patreon and also use PayPal for those that can't afford monthly support and ask your following to support your writing. That's the route I took and I'm making passive income doing so but I also have 14K plus followers. I suggest researching and finding an option you'd be most comfortable with but no matter which you chose start promoting yourself on social media now. ",

Once you start blogging, you will need traffic to your blog posts, which you can attain by using SEO (search engine optimization) or by syndicating the posts via various social media platforms.   I would first figure out how much money you'd like to be earning, in order to find an appropriate product to sell.  Most affiliate programs out there pay 10-50% commissions on average.

Of course, as usual, you'd have to do the work, as in everything from writing, to marketing, to product placement of your blog, to maintaining that market.  You gain more influence and star power this way, which turns into word of mouth. As your blog grows, you get better chances of reaching the top of the search engines for the keywords you want.

My range these days is now above $200, so I have to write a LOT less to make that $1000 a month (and try to make as much more as I can haha). It takes dedication, and you'll have to write even when you don't want to. That's the only way you can compete with the larger sites. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to do it. One way is by applying your blog to adsense. Google AdSense is a program run by Google through which website publishers in the Google Network of content sites serve text, images, video, or interactive media advertisements that are targeted to the site content and audience. These advertisements are administered, sorted, and maintained by Google. You can earn if someone click the advertisement or by impressions you got. Impressions depend on page views wherein the ads appear. Another way is by affiliate marketing. It is by selling products of some company you are in partner with. You earn here when someone who clicked on your affiliate link buys something. Well, earnings vary depending on the product or the company. One more option is a paid post. This works when some company paid you to test their product, and in return, you write your assessments and opinions. You should not be biased in doing this because you might lose your credibility in writing only the good things about the product. So, write the good ones and the not so good parts. You can also earn by selling your own products like online courses, e-books, planners, etc. Here, you can decide everything like how much it would cost and everything you could think of. ",

Affiliate Marketing is like advertising, just more exclusive. If you have something to sell or simply have content that people would be willing to pay for, you can monetize that through your blog. You can also do things like review product. Some bloggers and Youtubers started out simply reviewing products for free. Once they built up some trust and traffic, companies were willing to sponsor or at least provide them free product for review. ",

So I gave up trying to make an extra 100 or whatever a month now I just blog for fun and still enjoy doing it and now I don't have the pressure in me to make a sale from affiliate networks . So why am I telling you this is because you have to make a decision is it money your after or are you in love with the niche your blogging about ? if you want to earn you have to focus on Seo, low competition keywords and creating great wow content noone will visit or return to your blog if it does not provide useful info and is boring ",

            "answer_text": "Primarily there are 3 ways which are most commonly used to generate revenue out of a blog, they are: AdsSponsorshipAffiliate EarningAs a blogger one needs to understand that, any of these 3 is only possible when the blog content has a good audience reach. The logic is quite simple Why would any brand run ads when it doesn\u2019t get improved visibility through your blog or even why would one sponsor your blog if you do not have enough audience reach. The same is the case with affiliate earnings as the probability of people buying through affiliate links is the way is very less as compared to the number of visitors on your blog and therefore the only way to generate a decent affiliate earning is by having more audience reach. Now, you need to understand how organic audience reach is developed. Most of the audience for a blog comes through organic Google search results and therefore it is important for any blogger to rank their articles on multiple keywords. The more is the number of content pieces that rank higher on Google, the more is the traffic driven to the blog and therefore more is the chances of improved earning through ads, affiliate links or sponsorship. This is the theory that everyone knows, and even you can find this information on the internet. What\u2019s more important is to understand \u201cHow to rank higher or Google?\u201d To rank higher on google you need to write articles that are optimized according to the standards on which it ranks content. The process is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimization\u201d Few other skills which you need to have to write content that ranks higher and drives more traffic are: Keyword ResearchKeyword DensityCompetitive AnalysisRole of Back links in RankingIf you know these, great. You\u2019re good to go. If not, that\u2019s still okay because you can learn them in as little as 4 weeks. Yes, there are workshops and online courses that take just 4 weeks to train the students with every bit of content writing. One such course is the one offered by IIM SKILLS. First of all, online course which means you\u2019re going to learn without having to move out of your home struggling through the pathetic traffic. There is nothing that you can get in a classroom and not in an online session. Live lectures, one on one interaction with trainers, doubt sessions, assignments, and tasks, even exams also are conducted online. Also, sitting at home, you\u2019ll be able to get a \u201cHubspot Content Marketing Certification\u201d through this course. Not to mention, the trainers are very talented and hold expertise over each and every bit of content writing. They have worked for some of the very renowned companies we know of and are now dedicated to training students with the skills and their experience of over 10 years. Many of the students who graduated from this course, (Some are my colleagues and friends) are now running successful blogs, some are freelancing, some are course trainers and many have got well-paying jobs. That was all in detail about how you could possibly earn from a blog. ",

I was scared because I was alone waiting for him. I decided to go to home by myself so I was going towards my home. In middle of the road there was one bridge up side the river. I was walking through that river and I suddenly saw one beautiful lady. She asked me where I was going at this night time. I didn't answer her but. Also she was asking me same question for long time so I finally replied her saying \"I am going to my home\" She sayed that \"you should go home at this time\" I ignored her and just headed towards my home. When I looked at my watch. It was already 10:00 pm. I was so scared at that moment so I speed up my self and I saw around but the lady was vanished from there at that time.

I would recommend you to concentrate on building a blog with good content and try to find a niche for your blog. Do extensive research on the topic take time to build your blog to attract visitors on regular basis. Now to monetize the straight forward easy way is to display ads by integrating Google Adsense, info links etc.. If you don't want ads to show up all over your blog you can write some ebooks related to the niche and try to sell them, it is proven that selling something is more profitable than ads. The other way if you have technical knowledge and your blog is related to that you can build some tools/plugins that you  sell them. Hope this answers your question happy blogging!!  ",

You can start putting affiliate links from day 1 on your blog posts, but the chances that someone will actually click them AND purchase from them will only get better once you have established TRUST with your audience. In my opinion, you can join the likes of Clickbank and start reviewing some of their products on your blog. If your reviews / blog posts are awesome and you combine them with either a landing page or a squeeze page to collect emails, then you\u2019re on your way to monetization. Of course, you can put some Ads, but you\u2019ll find that these too will need some quality traffic before you can see a marked income. Hope this answers your query. Nadim ",

I started my channel almost a year ago to help my friends learn some java. Some videos are still generating some views per day for me, for example the below video which I made has crossed almost 9K+ views:   If you make some of such videos which people would want to watch then you could easily earn the above mentioned amount. Reasons why I consider YouTube as the best option:  1. You don't need a domain or a hosting.  2. Its easy to rank a particular video for a keyword as compared to a website or blog. 3. As your subscriber base grows your videos get more views, which in turn produces more money. The hard part: 1. Making videos is easy but getting traffic initially is difficult 2. You need a lot of patience, in the beginning you won't get much views. I hope it answers your question :) ",

The most successful and long running site I know of is about Nikon cameras. It's linked to a large Photo reseller as an affiliate. The site owner claims he makes a living from that one site and raised a family with the income.Make no mistake... Such a site relies on first page ratings for searches for the products you plan to write about. It is hard work but so is everything I've ever done for a living too.The other thing to keep in mind... No one making money from a blog or website is going to tell anyone else how they do it. I've told you about as much as I care to. Therest is up to you and how good you are at SEO for the site. ",

High income full time jobs? If you want all of this then I would recommend making a whole blog about it, rather than just a blog page. That way you can go into detail about each item you want to talk about to do with income. In making your blog page about whatever you choose, remember that the reason people will read it is for practical advise and answers on how to increase their income, so make sure you actually answer their questions! Give lists of actions to do, rank different strategies and give advise people can realistically follow. Hope this helps! ",

Yes, there are people who have done it, but for every success story there are far far more failures. I have to believe that lack of drive, the complexity of keeping a blog going and if you get that done - burn out is going to be a challenge. Here\u2019s a good article that I found: Can I Really Make a Living by Blogging?   So, if you\u2019re going to me a millionaire blogger, I suppose first you need to be clear on how many years its going to take you to earn that million. If it\u2019s a million a YEAR, then you\u2019re going to be in a very exclusive club. If 17% of bloggers make $120,000 or more a year - and you need to make 8 times the low end of that number, I suspect that you\u2019ll be in the top 1% of that top 17%. If blogging becomes you\u2019re life, I\u2019d suggest having a back up plan, as things could change and it you may find yourself having to find another way to make money before you\u2019re ready to retire.

For example : when you write about a tourist place, you can add that Certain Hotel named TryMe Corp and TryMe Corp cabs are awesome. So people get to check what is special in it, that's the mentality of everyone. So do affiliate with the Hotel and cab company. Use the link to make your viewers directed to the hotels website for booking. For every room books or cab books you will be paid based on the percentage you have affiliated for. Simple example : if you have used UC browser, they will have online site bookmarks in front page like flipkart, amazon etc. So when you click it, it gets you to amazon or flipkart. Check the URL, you can find that you're referred by UC browser to amazon or flipkart. Second thing is Adsense, To get a cool earning just by writing contents. There is only one way like this. The more visitors you have, the more the merrier. It's like more chance of getting your ads clicked and you can earn for every click your viewers make. If there are 1000 visitors, hope at least 5 clicks the ad. If there are 5000 visitors, hope atleast 10 clicks. That's it for now Thank you for the query | Get in touch Any time Abdul | TryMe Corp ",

You could have ads on your blog, affiliate links, you could sell your own products, add a classified page and promote your business. All of those tactics are great but will take some time to make a living off. Most bloggers don\u2019t make a lot of money their first year, and from what i can tell the fifth year seems to be the tipping point. So if you can keep blogging for five years you should be fine. ",

For a blog that is growing and won't likely draw big advertisers with big budgets out of the gate, this model is a great way for first-time bloggers to develop their biz dev instincts too--many ad networks will let you join up and run campaigns. This isn't going to generate instant commissions, but with the right fit, it'll be a good start to monetizing your blog.  Another important thing is to diversify your ad placements until you find something that fits. With time, it could also lead the way for bigger, more lucrative ad placements on your blog, too. ",

Once you go beyond that, you should start looking into paid reviews, running surveys, etc. So as you can see, the answer is not as simple my friend! The \"best way\" to earn from your blog depends on where you stand with your blog. And as John has rightly mentioned - Think Outside the box!Get creative - with smaller traffic, you can get a higher ROI by using alternative forms like asking  for donations, selling ebooks, swinging that audience into buying something / services from you, etc. ",

Otherwise, you will get really bored blogging. For example, I used to study English so I made a blog about learning English. I bought some products to help my English and wrote honest reviews about them. I put the affiliate links so my reader could buy them through them. I also emailed my subscribers and gave them some tips to learn English and shared some useful phrases. I wrote about 300 pages a little by little so it helped my blog stay on the first page of google with many keywords. If you like your niche, you can keep on going! Try! ",

Basically you would provide an experienced voice to the rich when they compare standardized McMansion plans that developers use to build standardized mansions. Another possibility is reviewing \u201ccruelty-free\u201d gemstone sources. Basically it should come from Canada or possibly Russia. Another approach is to look at the lifestyle magazine of the financial periodical Barrons (possibly Fridays), which is directed at high net wealth individuals. If it is advertised there, you could make a blog about anything there if you are interested. There are lots ways besides low volume, high wealth. I suggest you ask again on Quora or leave a comment with a longer version of the question that mentions what you are actually interested in! ",

I have also started my journey with blogging and when I started I don\u2019t even know what is SEO and how to write an article. I have done every best practice from my side but nothing happens in the first one year. Because I was not dedicated and I was doing something wrong which shoots me backfire. If you wanna earn through blogging you have to start writing daily or you have to optimize your content daily and you have to dedicate yourself in blogging. It\u2019s not that much hard and it\u2019s not that much easy. If you will give your extra time to blogging then it will give you something extra than anyone else. For you, my best suggestion is that first strat writing content because in blogging if you can write better then you can get better because your content represents your blog everywhere on the web. Or in case blogging takes and you want quick money then you can earn through writing as a freelance writer if you get your hands on writing. To rank a blog properly and driving traffic to it easily can take 6\u201312 months then you can earn a decent amount through blogging. But if you want a quick money then develop a skill, get knowledge and master it. When you get a skill then start selling it it can be anything writing, SEO , FB Ads or maybe google ads. By doing some freelance work you will get some investment to invest in your blog too or you can buy a extra cup of coffee for you with this money. Before earning from blogging you have to learn SEO - Search Engine Optimization. If you wanna know more or learn something from me you can connect with it takes nothing. Thank You Rythem Raj ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can earn a lot of money from a blog.  However, it's not a \"get rich quick\" kind of thing - it takes dedication and knowledge.  Some of the most common ways to earn money from blogs: Advertising - my least favorite method, because you're simply giving away all your hard earned traffic to someone else and letting them make most of the money while they pay you peanuts for the clicks. You're basically renting the space on your blog for someone else to place the ads they want.  Affiliate sales - Better - you get a part of the sale cost. Depending on the product and program, you may earn as little as 3-4%, or as much as 100% - 50-75% is typical.  You also have more control, and get to choose the products you want to promote.  Selling your own products or services - the best.  You have complete control, and you decide how much to charge.  Not only do you make money, by having your own products, you increase your authority in your niche. ",

Most of these ad sites (Google Adsense, Eleavers, etc.) pay on a paid per click rate so you only get paid if someone clicks the ad. The second and the one I recommend is affiliate marketing. Basically you take your niche (the topic of your website) and you review items from that niche. You then add a link to the blog post that when someone clicks and buys from that site you make a commission. So where ads may make you a few cents per click, affiliate marketing could make you $20 per click (earnings are up to the company you are promoting). Personally I have used both and I have had more success with marketing over ads. Best of luck, Sebastian. ",

Being able to change templates -- and even tweak templates with your own HTML code -- means you can determine exactly where your ads appear. Ad placement can be a major factor in getting more people to click your ads. In addition, if you are selling your own products and services -- in a business-to-business market, for example -- Blogger can also appear to be more professional than Tumblr, which has more of a social atmosphere. This means serious customers intent on buying something may be more likely to browse through your content, including your products and services. ",

We can sell ads on the blog, promote affiliate programs or products, sell our own products and the list goes on. Hope this helps. Cheers ",

When people visit your site, they have the opportunity to sign up for your newsletter. You send your subscribers helpful information over time and recommend an affiliate program. When they purchase, you get paid. The third option is to sell advertising space on your blog. There are vendors like BuySellAds .com that you can sign up for free. They provide ads for your site and you get paid a fixed monthly fee, normally between $20 and $40 per month depending on your niche and traffic. I highly recommend you build quality content on your site and earn money from your own email list. This allows you to earn a growing monthly income as your email list grows. You are not dependent on traffic from the search engines with a big enough list. There are some tips you need to know about list building, here is more information. ",
