            "answer_text": "My father was a violinist and he made me a quarter size violin for my second birthday. I vaguely remember having lessons at that age, but it was too early for it to make sense, so I was let off the hook for a while. My next round of violin lessons began again when I was in elementary school. I can\u2019t recall whether I was 6 or 7 at the time, but they continued through most of high school. I was pretty good because at music festivals I often placed first. There came a time for rebellion, though. Somewhere in my high school years, I decided to take up the bass guitar. No lessons, just figure it out. That spelled the end for the violin by the end of high school. A few years later, I was in my second band and the guitarist couldn\u2019t listen to the radio and figure out the chords to the latest songs. I bought a cheap guitar and began to supply him with the chords. When I asked him to play chords that he didn\u2019t know, we came to a parting of the ways. I continued to play bass with a few more bands and it was truly my instrument. Then something changed. I moved to another town for work and found a jam partner who needed a rhythm guitarist. I went back to the guitar in my 60s and, with the encouragement of my jam partner, I advanced my guitar game. It felt good once when I went to a casual musical get together with a number of people I hadn\u2019t met before. During the course of our playing, one of them seemed to be impressed with the combination of chords I was adding to the songs. He asked me how long I had been taking lessons. I was happy to say that I hadn\u2019t had my first lesson yet. I regret letting the violin lapse. I still know (in theory) how to play it, but I am so many years away from actually playing it that any effort would be a huge disappointment. ",

            "answer_text": "My parents got me an unplayable guitar and a series of group lessons when I was 12 (50+ years ago). My parents were very high I.Q.ers but didn't realize that they just set me up to fail, and it worked perfectly. As much as I wanted and practiced, the guitar never performed and frustration set in. While this problem really doesn't exist today because the Chinese became masters at making cheap but very playable guitars. (there is a lesson to be learned here.) later in life at 20 I tried agin with a guitar that was sitting around a communal apartment I was sharing. It was nylon string, the neck was set right and more playable. THat guitar sent me on a journey of playing guitar and electric guitar that morphed into electric bass then at 37 took up the upright bass for the next almost 30 years. I worked very hard learning to play it and just loved it. Played and sang in lots of bands. Then problems with my wrist, shoulder and fingers emerged and I had to stop a semi-pro career. Then about 5 years later I took up the lap steel guitar, which I'm still learning. The problem is that once your older and you've got these degenerative problems you just can't throw yourself into things like you used to plus the fire just isn't there, that's ok tho, it's all about the aging thing. My obversation about the learning thing tho is while its best to get in when your young, in your later 20's and thru your 30's there's this dedication thing that just can't be matched. In my late 60's and now 70's it's good to just play something that sounds like music. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess I was 11 or 12 years old and fell in love with the trumpet. I begged my Mom to get me one, but I knew she couldn\u2019t afford it, but one day she came home with a very used trumpet that a lady from her work gave her. She played in an all-girl orchestra and was pleased to give it to my Mom. I knew how to make a sound with my lips as I had an old bugle. Shortly after, I began taking lessons with the best trumpet teacher in town and took lessons for maybe 12 years. I played in the Junior and Senior High bands and even when drafted, was surprised that I wound up in the 80th Army Band near Savannah, Georgia. While in that band, I learned how to play the string bass and took lessons which allowed me success for the next 40 years playing in trios, duos, quartets, sextets and big band. I no longer desired to play the trumpet and up until a few years ago, played bass exclusively and still have it. Today, it\u2019s a different world as when I was a kid, you either played football or played in the school band and had the best of teachers. Today, it\u2019s drums and guitar and forget about the other instruments\u2026\u2026but then is gone and now is now. ",

            "answer_text": "I was 4 or 5 when I started learning the keyboard. Tiny toddler me was walking around a shopping centre when I heard this beautiful melody coming from somewhere. I looked into the glass window of a music store to see a lady playing the piano, oblivious that there was a young girl putting her nose so close to the glass the glass was fogging up. I was enthralled. What was this magical thing with so many buttons, and how could it make such beautiful sounds? I tugged at my mum's sleeve and asked if I could buy one. My mum laughed, and asked if I'd like lessons. I agreed immediately. I started taking organ lessons at first, and I was quite happy. I did well in class, apart from the stage fright that took over when I had to perform in front of the class. If you know me, you'll know that I'm very vertically challenged. I was the shortest kid in all of my classes. One day the teacher pulled my mom aside and told her that I was too short to reach the pedals and should probably look into playing the piano instead. I was devastated when I left the class but looking back, it was a blessing in disguise. I took up the piano and never looked back. Music is a huge part of my life, and I siezed every opportunity to learn. I took up the Yang Win (Chinese instrument) in secondary school when I was 13, then the vibraphone when I was 15, and learnt some guitar when I was 16. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me share my experience!! I\u2019m 23 right now! I always had fascination for musical instruments! When I was studying in 10th standard I went to learn piano, I learned scales there! It went well!But I didn\u2019t have a piano with me!! So I asked for a piano to my parents, and they weren\u2019t much interested to spend 8k to something that they consider as a waste! So it was the end of my music explorations! I went for engineering, and after that I was working in an NGO Last year, while I was working in NGO, I was staying in an uncle\u2019s home. He had a small guitar (bought for his son). It was worth for just 800 rupees! Due to some situations, I had to stay there 2\u20133 hours alone. I thought to try on the guitar from some guitar lessons in youtube. And I learned 2\u20133 chords! That felt awesome.. It happened in last year\u2026 And that changed everything\u2026 I was looking for guitar everywhere. Spent hours for finding beginner guitars! Thought and prayed for few months!! Finally I bought Yamaha F310 on May 19 2016! It is gonna be one year!! What I did was, I learned all scales and chords(maj, min and some variations) and ways to figure out chords in a song. So now, I can figure out chords in a song and strum, travis picking, and I am getting into fingerstyle\u2026 I am not an expert, but I am learning\u2026 I\u2019m glad that I could do much better than friends who went to music school for 3\u20134 years and who are playing guitar for some years\u2026 That\u2019s all! :) ",

Didn't stick. Tried again at 28, also didn't stick. Will try again someday. Age 30 - started playing guitar Age 31 - began voice lessons, started playing bass Age 32 - got back into piano, teaching myself Some thoughts / conclusions: It's truly never too lateLessons can be very helpful if they help you achieve your objectives.Adolescent piano lessons gave me lasting mechanical information but only taught me to play through other people's material without understanding what I was doing or how it worked. I lacked initiative at a younger age to solve those mysteries for myself or inquire for others to help me.Now my focus is more conceptual such that I can play what I want or what I'm hearing and can explore creatively rather than being locked to notes on a page.Tabla is very challenging. :-)",

I think children\u2019 age of 5, 6, or 7 is a good age to start, as me now being a violin teacher myself and seeing little children aged 3\u20135 trying to start violin lessons is not always working out. The child needs to have certain abilities to play such a difficult instrument like, good focus and concentration for at least 15 minutes and also physical characteristic, as a strong bones and muscles to hold and coordinate with the instrument.

My mum (herself a pianist and guitarist) had bought me a recorder for Christmas a couple of years previously, and I figured it was about time to learn how to use it. I was 9 when I started taking flute lessons, again at school. This was a natural progression for someone who was doing pretty well with the recorder. I was lucky enough to have two years of lessons with a flute specialist (albeit in groups rather than solo) but then a succession of generic woodwind teachers - a clarinettist, a bassoonist and a saxophonist - with no specialist knowledge of the flute pretty much put paid to any dreams I had of being properly good at the instrument. I was 13 when I told my classroom music teacher I could play the piano. It was the only way to get an exemption from weeks\u2019 worth of learning to read the treble clef and play five-note melodies with one hand, in a room full of non-musicians. Instead, I had to spend that time preparing a short recital for the class. No regrets - I certainly learned more in that time! I then went on to dep on keyboard in a church band (where I was already playing flute) and things took off from there. I was 17 when I was first given the opportunity to conduct the school band, in the first movement of Holst\u2019s second suite in F. I was 18 when my mum bought my sister a drum kit in a last-ditch attempt to interest her in music (after giving up on the clarinet and saxophone). I used a portion of my study leave to teach myself how to play it. My sister barely touched it. I was 19 when I was playing piccolo in just two numbers of a show (Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld) and they were desperately short of percussionists. I happened to have my drum sticks in my music stand case, so volunteered. That was how it all began\u2026 ",

Then I study my notes whenever I\u2019m on the go out of the flat. It helps to remind me of what I have to learn and practice. I watch videos of people playing the piano during what little free time I can get. Life is busy but there are ways to make it work for you.

I learnt very rapidly, and within a year I passed my grade 3. I soon outgrew my piano. We sold it to a builder who was doing work on our house at the time. He wanted it for his daughter. After a lot of saving (we've never had much money) we managed to buy a beautiful piano which I still have to this day. I was 13. It was \u00a31600. It sounds like so much more than that\u2026 it really is a beautiful piano. The bass is phenomenal. I'll never need another piano, I just love mine so much. I took my grade 5 a year later. I then took grade 5 theory, so that I could take the higher practical grades. I was entered for my grade 8 when I was 16, but I was taking my GCSEs at the time and the stress of it all caused me to pull out of my music exam. My piano is the most important and sentimental thing I have ever received. It amazes me to think that something as simple as my mum pointing out my long fingers shaped one of the most important parts of my life. ",

My father plays guitar, my mother the piano. My father would occasionally play with some friends on the local radio station. My grand-aunt used to play the piano and her sister would accompany her. She (my grandmother) recorded some songs in Portuguese with a musician long ago. Their brother used to play the violin and his wife would play the piano. I completed four out of the eight grades. Soon enough, I had to stop taking lessons because I had to prepare for higher education. I\u2019m a bit rusty now, but once I play a few notes, everything sort of \u201ccomes back\u201d and I can play like I did before. ",

            "answer_text": "I started with an Indian bamboo flute (the ones you can get from street hawkers) when I was in 6th standard. I got it on a whim. It is the kind that is played vertically (like a whistle or fipple or recorder flute)\u2026 I soon got bored of it and got myself a transverse flute from the same street hawkers. Fortunately I was able to produce sound without any difficulty. I merrily played some songs (mostly our national anthem and national song) but the flute was not well tuned. I gave up on it then. After a gap of many years I took up the flute again in my Engineering 3rd year and have never stopped practicing since. I kept learning on my own for about 6 years before I realised I needed a strong musical education (not just being able to play flute)..but being able to play \u201cmusic\u201d on flute. So my experience has been. Experiment with a toy instrument to find out if you have a natural affinity to it.Get a real instrument (once you are clear you have affinity to it) and experiment with itRealise you needed musical theory and musical education to actually play \u201cmusic\u201d and search for a guru.Keep practicing forever (there\u2019s no ending or stopping point for this step!).You could follow the same steps I did but you\u2019d be better served if you search for a guru right at the beginning. It\u2019ll save you a lot of time and you\u2019ll get better very quickly. ",
