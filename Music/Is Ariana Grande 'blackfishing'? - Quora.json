            "answer_text": "No I don't think so. Ariana Grande-Butera is half Sicilian and half Abruzzese and has never claimed to be black, hispanic or arab. She may have taken inspiration from black women as one of her biggest inspiration growing up was Mariah Carey who is half black. Ariana have mentioned in James Corden Carpool Karaoke about how she learned to do all those runs and riffs she does from singers like Beyonce, Whitney, Mariah etc.  The whole Ariana Grande blackfishing controversy started with an edit which depicts 2 pictures. 1 from 2009, where she's fair(but made 2 shades lighter with edit) with just recently dyed red hair and the other picture is a more recent pic from 2016, where she already had a bad tan and it was even further edit-darkened for some reason. They could've simply used the original pics to prove their point but they choose to edit it probably cause they despise her.  This is the edit\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc  This is a comparison of pics from the same red carpet event as the 2 pics edited pic comparison.  Since the edit surfaced recently, everything Ariana does is questioned. From the way she talks to way she walk, EVERYTHING SHE DOES IS SOMEHOW TWISTED UP AND MADE INTO MAKE IT SEEM AS IF SHE IS TRYING TO BE BLACK.  Her speaking accent has always been consistent but now people are claiming she uses \"aave\" to sound more exotic, which: 1. I don't think she's speaking in aave 2. Even if she was infact speaking in aave, its understandable cause 90% of her team workers(co-writers, producers etc) and her best friends are all african americans. And its natural to pick up certain speaking style from other people as she spend 99% time of her time with them.  The weird thing about this is, people started claiming she speaks in aave cause of the way she PRONOUNCED the word \"JUICE\" in one of her interview by billboards where she's reacting to her old pictures where baby ariana is holding a jar of juice and a cookie and Ariana was just trying to change up her speaking style a bit to try to be funny and trying to speak like herself from when she was a baby.  Now back to her skin color, Ariana is a naturally fair skinned person who can naturally tan as much as she tans right now. Ariana never wore her skin color as an accessory. When she's fair, she's fair, when she's tanned, she's TANNED. She do use fake tan cause she cannot stay as tanned as she gets in summer, during winter. But she never went out of hand with her fake tan.  Ariana's ethnicity: Ariana have never talked about her ethnicity but she have disclosed her grandparents' ethnicity from her mother's side. They're both part North African and heavily Greek.   Ariana have mentioned back in 2009 when she was fair- about her actually getting tanner rather than getting burned from sun. Ariana have also mentioned again back in 2009, the 1st time she used fake tan is in 2009, for 1 simple occasion. So I'll provide pics where she is naturally sun tanned without any fake tan, from before 2009:         Now another pics: ariana / her dad, who is naturally very tanned.   Now Ariana\u2019s other teen-adult skin color comparisons.    This is 2010 pic\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc  Also people claim Ariana got work done on her face to look more \"exotic\" when the most stricking difference she had is her size of her lips which zhe achieved with lip fillers and she have admitted to it too.

            "answer_text": "YES! Haha 100% but her fans wouldn\u2019t say it because they\u2019re in denial. But yes. Recently, Pete Davidson her Ex, stated something we all wanted to hear, \u201cMy career would be over tomorrow. If I spray-painted myself brown and hopped on the cover of Vogue magazine and just started s***ting on my ex.\u201c so that tells us he seen her get spray tanned before when they were together. So people were right of what they thought all the time. He knows more about her than what she presents herself to the public. it\u2019s not her true skin tone. Her skin tone was white when she was on Nickelodeon, then for someone she \u201cblack\u201d now. People say she\u2019s Mexican. No, she\u2019s white. People say she\u2019s Italian. No, that\u2019s her nationality. Italian is not a race. It\u2019s another excuse of her skin change by what her fans use. She got her lips done. Her fans say she uses a filter yeah she does on Instagram, but it\u2019s clear that she got lip fillers and her nose. Lately, she\u2019s been using Ebonic slangs when that\u2019s not how she really talks. Ebonic slangs is mainly used by black people. Like \u201cnah\u201d  Or on 7 rings, \u201cthey say which one I say nah I want allem.\u201d Allem is All of them. Another Ebonic slang. And here\u2019s the rest. It reflects Another Miley Cyrus Controversy in 2013.  ",
