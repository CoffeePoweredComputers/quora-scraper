            "answer_text": "*cracks knuckles* Yesterday, while I was on Instagram, I came across Yeri\u2019s post, in which she wrote that \u201cZimzalabim is out now\u201d; therefore I, being a soft ReVeLuv, went to check it out. I\u2019ll first say that when I heard it initially, without any context, I didn\u2019t like pretty much the whole song, except the vocal bit at 2:17; now THAT is what I look for in a song\u2014 the part of it that gives me chills. However, I was a bit disappointed, because the song as a whole wasn\u2019t as good as I thought it was going to be, considering that most of the song is composed of the word \u201cZimzalabim\u201d, and Red Velvet don\u2019t really get to show off their vocals in a way which really reflects how good they are. I will now proceed with a full breakdown of the song, given that I have done (ahem) rather extensive research (i.e. a quick Google search and listening to the song 20 times) and have been able to develop better opinions of the song due to me having understood the context behind it. (Note: I really, really, really wanted to do a breakdown of the song and tie it in with the visuals in the MV, but that would be FAR too long as answer. However, if you want to see that, I\u2019ll edit this answer later on.)  First off, let\u2019s break down the song title: \u201cZimzalabim\u201d. It is, according to the urban dictionary, \u201ca magical word that one would say to complete a trick, similar to abracadabra; it is composed of three names: Zim, Zala and Bim the trickster demons.\u201d This helps a lot when you try to interprete the song later on. Keep the definition in mind.  Let\u2019s start breaking it down. In the beginning, the lyrics are: \u201cAfter chasing anything, thing, thing, don't get burnt outIf you only just sit and wish wish wish for it, it won\u2019t come trueTake a look at your true self self self, see what you really wantWhat do you want want want, tell meShould we have fun today?\u201d The first four lines are basically an attempt to tell the reader that action is necessary if one wants to achieve their dreams; and that while they are in the process of reaching those dreams, they have to be careful to not \u201cget burnt out\u201d. The narrator also urges the listener to reflect inwardly and recognise their own deepest desires and act on them. The last line is said in a rather playful and teasing tone; the listener is left curious as to what the narrator means by \u201chaving fun\u201d; the word \u201ctoday\u201d also implies a sense of urgency and conveys the teasing tone; which makes the next set of lyrics all the more interesting.  \u201cThrow all your worriesOver the flat earthNananana nanananana higherTo the incantation blooming out of your lipsLet yourself goNananana nanananana ha\u201d In this set of lyrics, the narrator seems to be trying to ask the listener to relax and lie back, perhaps in an attempt to allow the reader to meditate or, given that we know the meaning of the title, astrally project. This latter interpretation is more accurate because the narrator references the \u201cflat earth\u201d, which could be an allusion to the fact that the song is now leaving the realms of reality; the sense of astral projection is further reinforced in the word \u201chigher\u201d, which can be seen as the listeners spirit leaving their body and proceeding to the astral plane. The incantation mentioned by the narrator is an allusion to the song\u2019s title; it hints at the fact that one would have to utter a spell in order to attain one\u2019s dreams. The word \u201cblooming\u201d implies that the incantation is not only uttered for one\u2019s own benefit, but its effects spread to the world around it; however, the listener still does not know what this incantation is.  \u201cLet's look for your dreams that have faded away and vanished\u201d \u201cLook at your eyes filled with hope(They're shining like a gem)Oh don't wander aimlessly so far away(You're dazzling, smile more brightly)The dream is inside you\u201d Time to break down these lyrics. In these lines, we learn that in the search to discover where one\u2019s dreams have gone, the narrator comes to the conclusion that their dreams reside within none other than themselves, showing the listener that it is the journey of self-discovery that matters more in the process of discovering ourselves; we may want to forget our worries, but in the end we need to keep ourselves grounded and look first within ourselves for the answers we seek.  Also \u2014 and this is a bit of a stretch \u2014 but \u201czimzalabim\u201d is uttered in sets of 2, four times. The number 4 is symbolic of stability and staying grounded and true to oneself; it shows us that we should be persistent in our efforts to achieve our dreams but always remember to stay true to who we are; this is scarily relatable to the song lyrics and the meaning it tries to get across. The number 4 is also strongly associated with the supernatural and demons in general; given that \u201czimzalabim\u201d is a reference to trickster demons and the word itself has four syllables, this could also be done intentionally in order to subtly reinforce the meaning of the song\u2014 or maybe it\u2019s just me. Yeah. Stream Zimzalabim. The song itself may not be as catchy as you expect, but the lyrics are powerful and filled with meaning; you just have to look beyond the surface; or in my case, Google the lyrics. Honestly, if Red Velvet keeps producing music of this quality, they will be on track to becoming the biggest girl group around. ",

            "answer_text": "I am realizing this stale and boring trend in K-pop where people do not care about making sense when all they want to do is be vindictive, spiteful and send hate to groups they do not like no matter what they do. People who will go out of their way to physically bring other groups down. If Red Velvet released a song like Bad Boy, these people would cry and say that they're being repetitive and using the clout of a popular song to hype a newer song. If Red Velvet released a song like Power Up, these people would cry and say that they're being repetitive and childish fruit girls. If Red Velvet released a song like Really Bad Boy, these people would cry and say that it's messy and all over the place. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THESE PEOPLE WILL GO ON AND PRAISE OTHER GROUPS FOR LITERALLY SONGS THAT SOUND MARGINALLY SIMILAR TO RV'S SONGS. This blatant hypocrisy is clear in how many of the 2019 releases of other groups were received. Dalla Dalla by Itzy? Praised. RBB by Red Velvet? Bashed. Fancy by Twice? Praised. Zimzalabim? polarizing. Red Velvet worked so hard for this moment, you can see it in every single shot in this music video so if you don't like it, go where you will be happy. If you are dissatisfied, go where you'll be satisfied. If you are disappointed, go where you will feel proud. If you think this is messy, go where you think it's clean. Moreover, if you think the song is bad, messy, all over the place or confusing, that's okay. Red Velvet does in fact have an audience who love it and so you are not doing us a favour by being here and we gain nothing from those comments except our parade being rained on. If you are trying to get into Red Velvet but can't handle all this non-generic music, go to where you are offered generic music. You are not inclined to like a song and complain about a group that will never give you what you want. We are 5 years into Red Velvet's d\u00e9but, we want to celebrate and be happy and feel good about seeing them grow into the artists that they have become. we want to celebrate and live the lyrics of this wonderful song. This is RED VELVET. Take it our leave it. But what we won't allow you to do is rain on our parade out of pure spite because it's trendy these days. You gain absolutely nothing. Not everyone will like a song yes, but no one is forcing you to be here. GO WHERE YOU GET UNWAVERING PLEASURE. FOCUS ON YOUR FAVES. *THIS IS RED VELVET*. They are a group from SM Entertainment. The same company with legendary and pioneering songs like I Got A Boy, Married To The Music, Tempo and Everybody. If you are looking for basic music, you came to the wrong place. But you can keep these stale, boring and unprovoked comments to yourselves. we're tired/ Everyone suddenly turns into a music connoisseur when Red Velvet releases new music and I think it\u2019s rather interesting\u2026 If not, support this comeback as much as you can:  ",
