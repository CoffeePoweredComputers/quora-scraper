He's been able to recognise the numbers 0\u201310 for a few months now, and he's able to recite the numbers in sequence and likes to wonder around saying them to himself. But I think he may started to count. If I ask him 'how many?'he points and say'waa,doo,tee\u2026'he can currently do up to 5 objects and adds another number in sequence every couple of days. I'd this true counting? Every so often I ask him\u2019how many\u2019and he responds immediately with the number\u2019one or two\u2019rather than counting up\u2019one, two, the\u2019. This is what has made me wonder\u2026. Does anyone have any experience with this? ",
