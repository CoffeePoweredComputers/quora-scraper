            "answer_text": "Diana Ross has loved performing and has always been very good at it. There is a part of her personality that needs the attention and adulation of her audience. It gives her energy and she thrives on it. Diana has been able to command significant concert fees for many years. This was important after around 1984 when her albums and singles no longer hit the top of the charts. However she continued to be able to pack stadiums right throughout the 80s and 90s due to almost four decades of wonderful music dating back to the Supremes. Diana has to be one of the greatest performers of the 100 years. When you listen to the music and watch her performances from the seventies through to the mid-eighties she is a mesmerising performer. When you listen to a recording of her 1977 concert \u201cAn Evening with Diana Ross\u201d you can appreciate the magic of Diana Ross in concert. Her 1983 outdoor Central Park concerts are also incredible television (and not just due to Diana performing in a storm in front of 400,000 New Yorkers). Diana is now 72. My advice to Diana is that it is now time to hang up the microphone. Her voice has changed, and when I saw the start of Diana\u2019s Honolulu concert I didn\u2019t recognise her voice. So my suggestion to Diana now would be to let us have the wonderful memories of you at your prime. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a fan of Diana Ross but I do know that it is the art itself that motivates her, she does not want to step down. Once the most important thing in her life, now second only to her children, it is the undying love that she has for performing, being on stage that keeps her going and the fact that she wants to continue to inspire her fans with her music for as long as she can. She once said in an interview: \u201c I will never stop performing until I begin to forget the lyrics.\u201d In the mind of Diana Ross this would not be an impressive way for ( The Boss.) to make her exit. So it\u2019s something I\u2019m sure that the public would never hear her do. ",
