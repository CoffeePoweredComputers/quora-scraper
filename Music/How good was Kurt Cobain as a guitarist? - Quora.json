            "answer_text": "Kurt Cobain was not a flashy guitarist, but he was a great one. The majority of Bleach was recorded in a few days. Listen to how on point his playing is in addition to his vocal duties. Original material and lots of practice. This brings us to\u2026 Nevermind. Recorded in around two weeks. Sure, the songs are simple. But listen to how tight the guitar tracks are. There\u2019s not a note out of place. The tone and playing are excellent. In Utero: We\u2019re in art country. Deciding that Nevermind came off \u201ccandy-ass\u201d, the band retreats for a couple weeks to record roughly two years later. You can decide for yourself how sober Cobain was at the time, but I\u2019d put my money on \u201crelatively\u201d. The studio was isolated, he had to prove himself, etc. Much of In Utero is recorded live and overdubbed with vocals later (the vocals took about 7 hours). \u201cMilk It\u201d, for instance, is a live take. Go do that. Now that Cobain\u2019s studio prowess has been touched upon, let\u2019s move on to concerts. He was a completely different animal on stage. Disheveled, overly distorted, raw, and using cheap equipment. If the pop-studio records would be his blueprint, here he found his credibility. His studio work showed he was a real songwriter and his shows proved he was a rock star. This is his basic resume, yet what I really respect about Cobain\u2019s guitar playing is his sense of touch. He always applied the proper force to each note played. He seemed to know exactly how to come across as lazy in his picking for dramatic effect as well as precise when the time called for it. \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right\u201d is a masterclass in modern rock guitar. I\u2019m not even considering dynamics, just the touch of the pick to the strings. So cool. Cobain was a master of his own tone, his own style. Reading his journals (the published ones) you can really understand how he masterminded his craft. Despite his appearance, Kurt Cobain worked hard. His guitar playing shows it. He surpassed many more talented people of his generation. That\u2019s why Nirvana\u2019s catalog of three studio albums can hold its own against a band with far more material. ",

            "answer_text": "Cobain was pretty good. Early on, when he was young and angsty and had a lot of punk rock influences, he had poor guitar technique, which was true of a lot of punk type players, especially young ones. Late in his career, he had taken some lessons and improved his technique, which we can observe in the Unplugged video sessions. Being the guitarist and singer in a three-piece rock outfit is a bit of a workout. You\u2019re kind of naked out there if you mess up. When Nirvana was sort of an anti-rock band and sloppy by nature, Kurt could get away with some messiness. In fact he was downright awful in Nirvana\u2019s early days, which I witnessed. It was the complete opposite of the highly technical, post EVH hair-band rock that was popular at the time. \u201cHey, we\u2019re punk-rawk and we suck!\u201d was kind of the mantra . . . and then because of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, they got a major-label record contract. Some clean-up was required, which included six months of daily practice with pro musician Dave Grohl. Kurt was also influenced by Thurston Moore\u2019s ability to make guitar noise sound musical. This is not easy to do. Guitarists who can do it are pretty good, to make an understatement, and Kurt could do it. When Nirvana hit it big Kurt had to learn technique to be able to survive touring . . . and mainstream crowds were expecting the band to \u201csound like the record.\u201d He got swallowed in the maw that is Rock Stardom, similarly to what happened to Jimi Hendrix. Not that he was fit to carry Jimi\u2019s guitar case . . . but Kurt was pretty good. ",
