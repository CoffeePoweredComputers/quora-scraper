            "answer_text": "Thanks for your request! In 2020, I look to continue the trend (in fact, I already have) of discovering new bands within the seemingly endless sub-genres of heavy metal. There are SO many bands across these sub-genres that it would be next to impossible to get bored doing so, and even if one particular style got stale, there are a ton more to choose from. What I\u2019ve seen over the past few years that I\u2019m really excited about, is a trend of \u201cepic\u201d metal, composed and executed by bands that have taken on an almost medieval aesthetic in their songwriting. Bands like Wilderun, Atlantean Kodex, and Obsequiae, whose music reminds me of traveling some vast, green countryside in pursuit of rescuing a fair maiden in distress. If it sounds corny, it is a bit, but it also captures the imagination and leads to some really great sounding metal. I also will be expanding my catalog of more extreme forms of metal. Death metal bands like Blood Incantation and Gatecreeper have crafted some real compelling cacophonies over the past year or two, and I look forward to adding their CD\u2019s to my collection. Similarly, a few Black metal groups such as Dark Fortress are high up on my list to really explore further this year. Other than that, I\u2019m looking forward to new releases by some of the more established, \u201cmainstream\u201d metal acts scheduled for 2020: Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Gojira all supposedly have new music this year, and I\u2019m eagerly and patiently awaiting their arrivals as well. I realize this is a very \u201cmetal-centric\u201d list, but as mentioned above, with so many varying styles and sounds, it\u2019s really easy to get lost in everything that falls under the metal banner. I\u2019m always open to new sounds, new genres, and new influences, so if you have any recommendations for something, I\u2019m all ears! -Mike ",

            "answer_text": "The easy (and somewhat facetious) answer is that as a music writer, I\u2019ll be listening to whatever artists and PR people send to me. I received more than 250 albums in 2019, very few of which were my choices - I do occasionally reach out to an artist, but mostly things arrive unsolicited. This kind of listening occupies a majority of my music time. Lately I\u2019ve been seeking out modern \u201cclassical\u201d composers, especially chamber music involving acoustic instruments combined with electronics. I\u2019m also loving a new crop of jazz from around the world that mixes in electronics and classical music. The third stream I\u2019m really fascinated with is groups like Dongyang Gozupa, combining Korean music with modern sounds. Surface, by DONGYANG GOZUPA ",

That is: 80\u00b4s rock, 80\u00b4s pop, 70\u00b4s rock, 70\u00b4s disco, late 2000\u00b4s/early 2010\u00b4s pop and some alternative hits from the late 90\u00b4s/2000\u00b4s. I am discovering new artists and bands. Just discovered some more hits of the band \u00b4Fire Tiger\u00b4 in fact. They\u00b4re awesome. ",
