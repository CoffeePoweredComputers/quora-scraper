            "answer_text": "Because you don't want to. You have narrowed your mindset when you think about boy groups. When you talk about boy bands, you picturize them in your mind as some tough looking boys with beards and moustache or long hair and tattoos all over your body. You imagine them as rough and tough men playing the drum or electric guitar and sometimes screaming at the top of their lungs in their concerts. That's how the world sees boybands. That's why you can't accept a group of smooth skinned, lean looking, colored haired, devoid of facial hair boys in their early twenties dancing gracefully or powerfully and singing stably at the same time as a \u201cboyband\u201d. They're just a complete deviation from the typical boyband image. They don't play drums or guitars in their concerts, they don't have tattoos, they're even better fashionistas which is primarily a field where only women can excel, they're boys who love to communicate with their fans by finding some time to go live from their busy schedule. They practically live 365 days of a year in their dorms where they keep making music or else keep practicing their choreographies. They put stage makeup just to blend with the concept of their songs or their dance unlike other boybands who never put makeup on because that's what they call \u201cfeminine\u201d. Sure makeup is a feminine thing but do you realize that kpop boybands esp. BTS are performers? They don't play instruments or just stand in a single position and wave their hands while singing, they perform. If you check out talent shows like America's Got Talent, you'll see even boys who are supposed to perform wear stage makeup. Alas! People fail to realize this simple difference between kpop boybands and other boybands. In Korea, having facial hair is considered \u201cdirty\u201d. That's why they shave off their beards and moustaches everyday. People keep judging them based on their looks and their dresses. They fail to even recognize their talents. If you consider to not be one of those narrow minded people, I suggest you to listen to their music. You like it, you listen to it. You don't, you leave. Don't judge them based on your made up image of how boybands should look like. Kpop has always been considered something like bubblegum pop with too much colorful music videos,where boys and girls keep acting cute and stuff. Believe me, that's only 10% of what kpop really is. I don't know why you can't get into girl groups but kpop in general is something you can into only when you just for the time being decide to stop judging them based on these allegations and listen to their music and their videos and see if those allegations are true or not.

            "answer_text": "Seems like you want to. Maybe you just don't like it. Maybe the genre doesn't suit your tastes. Really, no need to force yourself into getting into something you don't like. Or maybe, you had some expectations and the reality was something else. You probably were expecting a boy band , like 1D most probably. Or that they play drums and bass and have tattoos and piercings. So seeing a group singing and dancing, basically performing, was kind of like a shock. Kpop is not really similar to Western pop. So don't expect them to sing about drugs and sex, especially BTS. They have amazing albums which are based on different themes. BTS mainly focuses on youths. They produce meaningful songs which will make you think about everything. Their songs are literally full of emotions. And they have beautiful voices too. Basically , they have a lot of talent. After achieving so much ( even being nominated for the Grammys), they still remain so humble and down to earth. Also, they are such meme faces, so you'd love them!(wow, looks like I m advertising these 7 guys lol) You don't need to force yourself to get into it. But if you want to ,then you are always welcome! And it need not necessarily be BTS; you can get into any other boy/girl group you want to.  I mean, look at these strikingly handsome boys! Who wouldn't want to see them sing and rap and snatch away your wigs?? ",
