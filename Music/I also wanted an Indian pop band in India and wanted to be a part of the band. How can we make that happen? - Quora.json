            "answer_text": "Now, to make a \u201cpop\u201d band means to craft a sound enjoyable to the masses and a brand image that is recognizable and trendy. The Indian music scene is still dominated by Filmy songs and masses still associate actors with the songs and music with films. The rise of rappers in the industry is giving a glimmer of hope in the landscape and maybe NOW is the perfect time to chew the opportunity. That being said, for you to make a successful pop band in India would need the following ingredients: Musical sound that appeals to masses and caters to musical trends(in the current context that would be more of rap leaning music although we see other types of music getting popular as well ) Brand image consistent with its character and appealing to either a majority or a very passionate niche minority. You can network around and contact multiple people you know who are musicians to pitch this idea to them however\u2026\u2026\u2026. Well realistically its very unlikely this will work. People tend to put forth individual interests at priority and being in a band is gonna be a compromise on certain parts to the majority lot. However if you do find a couple of people who share the same vision as you and you folks enjoy jamming with each other and happen to create a sense of bonding you might make the next big thing. Ive always wanted to create something like a pop band in India but a lot of things still need to be developed in the Industry level to make it a succes. Artists get paid less through streaming so major income sources are touring and physical sales. Indias concert and tour scene is not comparable to western countries and hence not a lot of revenue is generated. As for record sales India almost has none of it. A lot of brainstorming needs to be done if we try to create something phenomenal in the band landscape in India. I hope you keep up with all the struggles and craft your tea. Good luck! ",
