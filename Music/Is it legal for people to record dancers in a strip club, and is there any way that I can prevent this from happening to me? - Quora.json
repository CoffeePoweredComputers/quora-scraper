            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective (but broadly true throughout the Western world): Photography is legal, including video, anywhere that people can gather. The law only forbids it in locker rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and changing rooms. So yes, someone can legally film in a stripclub. But\u2026 Private property can impose all sorts of rules that visitor\u2019s have to follow. Dress codes, age limits, no yelling rules, or any other arbitrary rule. Among these, they can ban all photographer and video, merely by telling someone in person (including by posting a sign at the entrance). Enforcement of this rule falls under trespassing laws. Bouncers can physically eject someone (limited by state laws) and the police can arrest someone, should they feel the offense warrants it. It is really, really hard to literally prevent people from breaking rules or laws. You impose punishments after they break the rules, but literally preventing murder and other crimes; obviously that isn\u2019t possible. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not legal, it is a sex crime, and when it happens you can alert security, or even take the customers phone yourself to a manager. I\u2019ve done it on many occasions. It\u2019s a privacy concern, and it is ALL of our responsibilities to be alert and aware. There are dancers that I work with that are victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and most that are just plain uncomfortable with others knowing what they do for work. It is a violation of our privacy, our bodies and it can be considered sexual assault for these men to take any kind of photos or videos without our knowledge or permission. If a guy ever does this and you are unable to tell someone in time, put your clothes on, tell the other girls and walk off stage immediately. Hope this helps. ",
