            "answer_text": "After being married for 10 years to a woman who couldn't have kids and going through fertility treatments etc.. I later found it kind of sexy and a turn on to really KNOW this woman was fertile and that there was a possibility that I could create life inside her... I know, seems weird because its not like I was looking to knock somebody up.. but being with a woman I KNEW had absolute proof of her fertility just made her extra sexy to me somehow especially the few times we wouldn't use protection.  Like she was even more feminine and more of a woman and there was something much more powerful about finishing up by leaving a deposit.... the 3 (no 4..) women I've had a real thing with since my divorce included a Chinese woman with a child in China, the much younger single mother who didn't have custody and was working as a nanny for the family across the street from me when I went through my divorce and she ended up being the one who kind of gave me my mojo back, LOL... and the Chinese woman I'm married to now and am in the process of adopting my stepson with...  It looks like a pattern but the youngin (totally legal though, just at 26 a whole lot younger than my 36 or so years at the time) was a white girl, LOL.. Oh and the other girl (Filipina) I dated for 2 years before moving/splitting and meeting my now wife also was a single mother, all with sons.. only 2 of which I had much contact with but I got along fantastically with both. I don't know.  I guess the fact that I am adopted and absolutely love and admire my own adoptive father, want to be a father yet couldn't because of the situation in my first marriage and felt almost that at my age it was getting to the point where its kind of too late for that to happen, makes me see the single mother thing not as a negative but almost as a gift this woman brings into my life with her... The family I always wanted to have.   Since I am adopted myself, I can't see that as any different from going the bio route because honestly I can't really relate to that experience.  My own family was not built on DNA just love and closeness as is the one I have now with my new wife and our 5 year old who really knows no other father figure but me.   Perfect scenario. I guess if the kid were older and resented me or hated me for taking his/her father's place, it would make things harder to continue a relationship on farther than casually, but luckily for me Ive never been down that particular difficult road.  Generally I meet a woman and like her, talk to her, am attracted to her, we click and if she has a kid its not an issue for me as long as there is not some associated major baggage, or 3 kids and it feels like she is looking for financial support more than a real relationship partner.   ...And like I said.. after my last marriage, its somehow a turn on just knowing all her girlie parts really do work, LOL though, I'd never go after a woman specifically because shes got kids..  That would just be weird.. Its more like discovering she has really great nipples or the cleft between her hip and stomach just is really sexy or something.. a secondary thing that just ends up being sexy to me... LOL after rereading the top I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea! ",

            "answer_text": "As a single guy who did not sleep around when I was younger I wouldn't want a single mom in my life. I would find it embarrassing to be seen bringing up another man's children. In fact I would prefer to marry a virgin who is also a member of my Christian denomination; so understands and fits in with the lifestyle members of my denomination lead. The trouble is I'm a lapsed member of my denomination but still keep the lifestyle. Eg. no pork products, no shellfish, no smoking, no drinking. I'm not interested in becoming unhealthy; eating foods I don't miss, or through smoking or drinking. The fact you have got children and not married means you have got baggage in your life. What really p's me off are girls who want to sleep around like \u201cthe boys\u201d when they are the ones who get pregnant. Stuck with children and no man in their life they then want other men to sympathise with the situation they find themselves in. In fact there is something about the way promiscuous girls look I find unattractive. Of course a single mom is not necessarily a promiscuous person. But I have a cousin who's wife's mother became a single mom when she was a baby. Her father left her and her brother as babies for another woman. She ended up having alot of half siblings as her mother looked in vain whilst she was growing up for another man in her life. But they all come and went leaving her mother with more and more children. Ugh ! ",
