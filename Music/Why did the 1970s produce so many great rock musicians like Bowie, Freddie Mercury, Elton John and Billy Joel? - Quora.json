            "answer_text": "I think a big part of it was the existence of the great British rock musicians from the 1960s. As Rob Halkovich mentioned, there was huge influence in Britain from the great black blues and R&B musicians, and this resulted the 60s bands I mention. The Beatles in particular but also the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, and many more were HUGE influences on the likes of David Bowie and Billy Joel, among numerous others. And as was mentioned by Andrew Chapman, the corporate greed at both the record companies and the radio stations had not yet fully materialized. So musicians were free to be creative and build upon what their predecessors had built, making music that\u2019s just as good if not better. I agree that neither Dark Side of the Moon nor Stairway to Heaven would have made it 10 years later. Neither would have Elton John\u2019s album \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d or David Bowie\u2019s \u201cZiggy Stardust\u201d or Queen\u2019s \u201cA Night at the Opera.\u201d The 1980s did produce some very good music, but thanks to corporate greed\u2019s tightening noose, the great rock musicians of the 1980s were fewer and not as great. In a nutshell, corporate greed is deadly poison to creativity. This got worse and worse through the 1990s. I consider it a miracle that bands like Alice in Chains or Nirvana were even possible. And now, well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s more than a dozen or so musicians from this millennium that I\u2019ve given space in my music collection. :( ",

            "answer_text": "Dan Stewart-Martin makes a good point to start. For those of us alive then, we tend to forget the bad stuff, and for those who weren\u2019t alive yet, you probably have never heard it! The \u201970s was also the last great time of relative freedom for music artists. While being beholden to record labels, the labels still largely allowed the musicians a lot of latitude and typically gave promising ones a few albums to develop their sound. By the late \u201970s and certainly the 1980s, the corporate pressure of record labels pushed financial returns\u2026 more hit songs, more sales, quicker turnaround between albums, etc. All of this diminished the freedom of the artists in their music. A legendary piece like Dark Side of the Moon may very well have never happened just ten years later, and likewise for the epic \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d which was waaaaay too long for \u201980s radio. Corporate pressure also infested radio by the late \u201970s and \u201880s, which meant that FM stations and deejays didn\u2019t have their freedom either. Corporate-driven playlists started to replace the independence of deejays to pick their own songs. More and more major stations fell under the ownership of corporate conglomerates, which led to stations across the country playing much of the same stuff in homogeny. By the early \u201870s, FM stations had gained popularity by being more adventurous in their music (compared to the pop-focused AM stations), but by the mid-\u201980s this was almost entirely lost, with the exception of a few major indie and college stations. (In this paragraph, I\u2019m referring to radio in the U.S.; I can\u2019t speak to radio at that time in other countries.) The last factor is that rock music was still relatively new. Think of it this way\u2026 halfway through the 1970s, it was only 20 years old. And rock music as it had become (as opposed to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was really only about ten years old, corresponding to the \u201cBritish Invasion\u201d in 1964-\u201965. Musically, there was vast territory open for exploration, which led to the diversity among the artists you mention in your question. In 1965, most rock music was quite similar; less than 15 years later, you had punk, progressive rock, glam, heavy metal, new wave, soft rock, arena rock, hard rock, and pop rock. That\u2019s a pretty amazing transformation in such a short time. ",
