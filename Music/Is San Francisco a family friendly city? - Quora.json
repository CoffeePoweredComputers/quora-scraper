            "answer_text": "I grew up in San Francisco and it SUCKED. I lived in Pac Heights, across the street from a park where I could not go because it was filled with gay men having sex in the bushes. My friends all lived miles away. I didn't learn to ride a bike until I was 12. It just was not what a childhood should be. My parents still live there and I spend a lot of time there, it's still a lousy place to raise kids IMO. I am raising my kids in Mill Valley, just north of SF. They go to public schools which they can walk or bike to, they can walk or bike to multiple SAFE parks and to all their friends\u2019 houses. We know the majority of the families in our area and I feel my kids are safe because the whole community is looking out for them even when I'm not around. It's so easy for my kids to hang out with their friends, there are so many family oriented community events \u2026.it's really truly wonderful. We are also surrounded by incredible nature preserves and open space and beaches and glorious mount Tamalpais! It's like the polar opposite of growing up in SF, I'm so happy I'm able to raise my kids in this incredible environment! ",
