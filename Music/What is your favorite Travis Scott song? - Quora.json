            "answer_text": "I love Travis Scott. He has been creating some great sounding music the past few years. With that he has been gaining a ton of popularity, especially with the release of his first two albums, Rodeo and Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. Both of these albums are awesome, and I would recommend listening to them if you are a Travis Scott fan. Even his previous mix-tapes before these albums are solid, Days Before Rodeo and Owl Pharaoh. Overall, I would say my favorite Travis Scott song is Impossible, off of his debut album Rodeo. This song has such a cool vibe to it and I just love the flow of the lyrics and how it meshes with the beat so perfectly. It has a real nice bounce to it. Have a few cocktails then listen to this song and tell me Travis Scott isn\u2019t dope. But, a few others I recommend off this album are Oh My Dis Side, Wasted, and 90210. Whole album is great though. Off of BITTSM, I recommend these tracks: the ends, way back, and coordinate, also sdp interlude, outside, wonderful, and of course goosebumps. Off of Days Before Rodeo, I recommend the intro, Quintana Pt. 2, Drugs You Should Try, Don\u2019t Play (fire verse from Travis), and Backyard is one of my recent favorites. Owl Pharaoh is not bad either, has some gems but I\u2019d have to say the true gems come from his subsequent projects. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the first question I'm answering on Quora. I'm a fan of Travis $cott's recent work. Travis $cott relies on features pretty often so my favorite song by him that includes another artist would be First Take feat. Bryson Tiller. It's a pretty smooth and easy going song that takes me to a place which allows me to think about recent romantic encounters/conquests. Also, Tiller's verse is A-tier to me when it comes to discussing real life romance. My favorite Travis $cott song where he is the only artist would be Apple Pie. I hear it as a declaration of independence, not being tied down to anyone or anything and being as fluid as he possibly can. All while also being unapologetically him. It sounds like the proper steps to achieving happiness in my opinion. I looked at some of the other answers to this question and would have to agree that they are all great songs. These two just do a bit more for me. A few weeks ago, I would have said that Wonderful is my favorite song featuring another artist. Back then, I thought that featured artist was the Weeknd, but I found out it was The Dream. Still a great song, but this is the second time I've mistaken The Dream's voice for The Weeknd (Ultralight Beam-Kanye West, which I thought was incredible considering The Weeknd's usual subject matter), so the song kinda lost its luster in my eyes.
