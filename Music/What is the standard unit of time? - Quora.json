            "answer_text": "The base SI unit of time is the second. As a base SI unit, the second also plays a very strong role in the metric system as a whole.Any of the 20 SI prefixes (10 multiples and 10 submultiples) may be applied to the second to come up with SI-approved units for duration of time that can be miniscule enough to correspond to the fastest radioactive decays to the huge, with the zettasecond and yoctosecond being longer than the estimated age of the universe. In actual practice, all the SI submultiples except the decisecond and centisecond are readily used; the SI multiples of the second are rarely used. The metric system also permits the use of the non-SI units of minute, hour, and day.Many people are surprised that the metric, imperial, and US customary systems have all permitted the use of the second, minute, hour, and day. This has caused some people to be confused because they think that there is no overlap between the metric system and the imperial and US customary systems. These units of time were in use long before the advent of the metric system and they were not defined to be part of the early versions of the metric system, but as time passed it seemed to make more and more sense for the metric system to adopt them as well. In turn, the submultiples of the second were adopted into the imperial and US customary systems.Many people also wonder about the minute, hour, and day because the factors interrelating them are not powers of 10. The French revolution tried to metricate the longer units of time --to have 10 months in a year and 10 days in a week, but the day and years are very important measure ",

            "answer_text": "There have been various attempts to create alternative units for time. I remember Beat Time, also known as Swatch Internet Time, an attempt by Swatch to introduce a new time unit.[1] The idea was that it would divide the day into 1,000 \u201cbeats\u201d, and that Beat Time would be the same all over the world (that is, no time zones). It still seems to exist, but I haven\u2019t seen or heard about it for at least 15 years. For a time I had a widget on my Mac showing Beat Time, but I don\u2019t think I ever ran across anyone else who actually used it. Then various cultures around the world have had their own timekeeping systems, such as the Chinese system.[2] There have also been attempts to introduce decimal time,[3] such as with the French revolutionary calendar.[4] There have even been a couple of suggestions for hexadecimal time.[5] But none have ever really gotten off the ground in the modern era in common everyday usage.
