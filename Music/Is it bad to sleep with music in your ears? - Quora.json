            "answer_text": "Maybe. Depends on the music. If it\u2019s loud, it can disturb your sleep and creep into your dreams, which may or may not be what you want. If it\u2019s emotional and hooks into your feelings it can make it difficult to relax and let go \u2026 which is part of falling asleep. And really, the lyrics DO matter. You don\u2019t want to sleep with someone telling you stories that you don\u2019t want to have incorporated into your brain overnight. You don\u2019t want to have someone singing about \u201cson of a bitch, gimme a drink\u201d or \u201ctried to make me go to rehab\u201d or \u201cfight for your right to party\u201d or just about any kind of celebration of being stupid, self-destructive, or hurtful of other people, doesn\u2019t belong in your sleep music program. Lyrics should matter when you\u2019re awake, and they DO matter when you\u2019re asleep. So it\u2019s important, if you\u2019re using music to distract you so you can fall asleep, to pick something that won\u2019t sabotage you. Some sleep specialists will tell you that you shouldn\u2019t have music on, or that you should have a white-noise generator to blur out sounds. On the other hand, when my wife was being treated for cancer, and later when she was dying of a return of the same cancer, music was a necessity for her to be able to sleep. But it was specific music: the kind of calm, empty, pleasant \u201cair pudding\u201d kind of waiting room music didn\u2019t work. \u201cAmbient\u201d \u201cnew-age\u201d music that was relaxing and evoked nature and peace, especially if it incorporated natural sounds, was what she needed to be able to sleep. If it was too intense or too beautiful it woke strong emotions when she didn\u2019t have the energy to fight the disease and the radiation so she couldn\u2019t sleep, and sleep was what she needed. Note that \u201cnew age\u201d is not who we were as people, it was just the best kind of music for that situation. I tend to sleep with ambient nature music now. I will use different kinds of music to wake up to, because they will get me out of the \u2018I want to stay asleep\u2019 thing that happens when I\u2019m fighting with seasonal sleep disruption. Then again, I do have narcolepsy and sleep apnea (both treated) which make it difficult to sleep at night sometimes. So I\u2019m using the music as a medication substitute. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it actually helps. Unless you live in a cabin in the woods. I\u2019ve been sleeping with music for a long time now, maybe ten years or fifteen, I make a special playlist, and then change at a little bit when new music comes up, but it is made of the music that helps me personally fall asleep. My list cannot start with anything heavy, usually I stars with some techno or slow acid, then there\u2019s time for several soundtracks like Mulholland Drive OST, jazzy Jessica Jones soundtrack, Thelma Score, then goes Chelsea Wolfe\u2019s three or four albums in a row, this drone or over-fuzzed sound somehow doesn\u2019t ever wake me up, no, the monotonous sounds help the brain to figure out some wave I am floating on. You actually cannot listen to the music while sleeping, it is working on your subconsciousness, on your biorhythms for sleep, in my case, it normalizes and makes my sleep as long and uninterrupted as it is possible, and I need to have lots of sleep, otherwise I\u2019ll have seizures. I put the volume down to one dash, but since the outside noise is getting lower during the night, I hear every detail, and enjoy two or three songs before I fall asleep. I\u2019d warn against classical music: it always wakes me up, because of the high pitched instruments and the crazy dynamics within a piece of music, it\u2019s always either sudden trumpets, or sudden silent pause, this wakes me up every time. The classical music deserves to be listened by an awake ear. But again, it is all personal. There\u2019s absolutely no danger to your hearing if you don\u2019t crank it up to the maximum, no danger of developing an addiction to it, \u2014several days ago I had to leave my iphone for restoring and updating plugged into my notebook in another room, so I went to bed without music, but I fell asleep quickly and the overall seep quality was the same. I even forgot I wanted to check if my phone is ready during the night. ",
