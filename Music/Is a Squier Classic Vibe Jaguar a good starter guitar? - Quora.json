            "answer_text": "There are two parts of the question. First, there is the Squier Classic Vibe part. In general, Squier Classic Vibe instruments are very good. These are among the best of the Fender instruments made in Asia, with good fit/finish, excellent materials, and solid components. They aren\u2019t professional instruments by design, but they could serve as professional instruments if needed. Second, there is the Jaguar part. The Jaguar is an interesting design, as it was introduced to serve as Fender\u2019s flagship model in the mid-60s. However, the cool offset design appealed more to early 70s hipsters in New York than the planned California jazzers and rockers of the time. One area in which the Jaguar diverges from better known models is in scale length. The scale of the Jaguar neck is 24\u2033, as compared to almost all Gibson models (24 3/4\u2033) and typical Fender models (25 1/2\u2033). A 24\u2033 neck is short, and guitars with such necks are often referred to as short-scale (although shorter necks are also found). One who learns on a 24\u2033 neck will be used to floppier strings and shorter distances between frets. I have an average hand (size 7 glove), and a 24\u2033 neck is as small as I can tolerate comfortably. If one gets really used to a 24\u2033 neck, adapting to other guitars will take some time. Some people have a hard enough time moving from a Gibson neck to a Fender one (Brian Setzer is one of those people). In answer to your question, a Classic Vibe Strat or Tele is a much better choice. Learn on a more generalizable instrument, then try a Jaguar or Mustang if you are moved to do so. If you are able to buy used, consider doing so, as new guitars depreciate rapidly after purchase, but used guitars hold value. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not terrible, but there might be better options. It has tall frets, which are a turn off for some players. It also has quite a few switching options on the guitar. This might overwhelm beginners, but it might inspire more practice just exploring tones. There also might be some challenges upgrading parts later if you stick with playing by comparison to a Telecaster or Stratocaster. My personal recommendation for a first guitar is almost always a Telecaster style. Whatever you do budget an extra $100 for several packs of strings and a proper set-up with those strings from a qualified tech. ",
