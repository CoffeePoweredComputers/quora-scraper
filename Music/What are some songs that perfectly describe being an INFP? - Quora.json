            "answer_text": "I would imagine that the typical INFP has pretty eclectic taste in music. I know I do. I\u2019m constantly expanding my music pool, and my current favorites don\u2019t really share anything in common with the few moldy-oldies I still enjoy on occasion. I don\u2019t care about lyrics that much; perhaps this makes me even less typical among the atypical. ;) For me, it\u2019s all about the beat, baby! Here are a few of my favorite blasts from the past. I was raised in a pretty conservative time and location, so I had no idea as a kid that a lot of the lyrics were about sex, drugs and death. (Joining the military and gaining a broader perspective helped with my learning curve, lol.) I have very selective taste in rock\u2014a few mainstream hard rock tunes, Southern rock, pop rock and soft rock. (No metal of any kind \u2019cause my brain can\u2019t interpret it as music.) I\u2019ve selected a couple random rock genres; more or less angst with a beat. I loved these then because they were so danceable, and I love them now for the same reason. (OMG, how can I be this old?). Creedence Clearwater Revival - Green River (Lyric Video) (1969)  Steely Dan \u300aDo It Again\u300b ( original studio sound version) (1972)  Boston - Don't Look Back (1978)  I truly fell in love with music when disco arrived. As a dancer, the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s were a revelation for me. Oh my god, so much BEAT! It was goofy, uninhibited, and playful, sensual rather than sexual. IMHO, it\u2019s so much more fun and interesting than most of the current pop stuff. The hair (mullet love), the clothes; yes, I wore leg warmers and big hair. :) It was hard to narrow down my choices, but here are a few of my favorites. I\u2019m still movin\u2019 and groovin\u2019 to the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. :D Earth, Wind & Fire - Let's Groove (1981)  Dazz Band -- Let It Whip (1982)  Wang Chung - Everybody Have Fun Tonight (1986)  Mark Morrison - Return of the Mack (C&J Street Mix - High Quality) (1996)  Michael Jackson - Bad (1987)  The 2000\u2019s are harder to pin down. Suddenly I couldn\u2019t find music that fit. My life was a train wreck, and my usual coping strategies were tanking. While noodling around on YouTube one day, I found something I didn\u2019t even know existed\u2014Progressive House music. Progressive House is multi-faceted, with several sub genres (from the sublime to the ridiculous), and an incredible array of composers. From heavy dance music to total chill, it can be haunting, uplifting and evocative. It\u2019s worth a look. You might find something you weren\u2019t expecting, like I did. :) I\u2019m going to gush a lot about this, because listening over an extended time seems to be healing me. (Do other INFP\u2019s also live in a sort of perpetual melancholia?) Anyway, something about the way it\u2019s crafted makes me feel close to the composer and also the other listeners. I\u2019ve never felt this way before. It feels like the music is doing something to change my brain chemistry, in a way that makes me feel more like myself instead of always wanting to hide under a rock. :P I definitely need more metaphors to explain this\u2026ugh. Again, it\u2019s so hard to choose, but here are a few of my favorites. A few with heavy beats and a few super chill songs. All are instrumental. :) Monojoke - Chatterbox (Original Mix) (2016)  LoQuai & Ewan Rill: Beat Meditation (Cream & Deep Fog Remix) (2015)  Imogen Heap - The Moment I Said It (Airbase pres. Scarab Remix) (2008)  Net Son & Lucas Hache - Sogno (Zan Prevee Remix) (2015)  East Cafe - Introverted Neighbours (LoQuai Remix)(2014)  Above & Beyond - Tri-State (5vel Remix)  Hammock - Andalusia (2010)  I\u2019ve love to hear from anyone who either digs this music or generally thinks it\u2019s crap. Let\u2019s discuss! :D ",

            "answer_text": "Oh no.Souldn\u2019t have let me see this question haha I live for this. I know a good little bundle of songs that I can confidently say perfectly capture and describe being an INFP. Here we go! The Listening - LightsThis song is so spot-on for me. This song perfectly talks about how it feels when you have SO MUCH TO SAY but you can\u2019t get the right words out. All you want is for everything to be okay, for everyone to be on the same page, and for conflict to be avoided or quickly and fully addressed and dealt with so things can be good again. You feel and think so much on a subject but can\u2019t seem to get all your words out in an argument or discussion, and even if you can, it\u2019s hours later after the situation happened.  Pocketful of Poetry - Mindy GledhillThis song is so INFP it hurts haha Being a creative type who can\u2019t seem to get grounded, head-in-the-clouds mentality, and a penchant for being curious and pondering purpose in life\u2026 yeah that\u2019s pretty INFP.  Trouble No More - Mindy GledhillSurprisingly, I\u2019m pretty sure Mindy is an INFJ, but many of her songs scream INFP haha This one included. A song about dreaming of a brighter, fantastic future of positivity and seeing the wonderful silver lining in what could be.  Horizon - Singularity\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just listen? I create my prison. I\u2019m chained by my own heart and mind.\u201d The unofficial INFP tagline.  Lucid Dream - Owl CityOkay Owl City AKA Adam Young, though\u2026 He is an INFP. I guarantee it. This song is just one of the very, very many of Owl City songs that scream INFP. I don\u2019t even have to say anything tbh.  The Real World - Owl CitySame for this one as above; speaks for itself.\u201cReality is a lovely place, but I wouldn\u2019t wanna live there.\u201d It doesn\u2019t really get much more INFP than that, let\u2019s be real.  Keep Up (ft. Steph Jones) - Felix CartalA perfect portrayal of how it feels when your heart just sort of runs off too fast for your feet. You can\u2019t keep up\u2026 but at the same time you don\u2019t really want it to stop.  Bleeding Heart - Regina SpektorJust like Adam Young, I wholeheartedly believe Regina is an INFP and pretty much all of her songs are relatable, being an INFP listening to them. Bleeding Heart especially. This song perfectly showcases how it feels growing up as the quiet, introverted, dorky/geeky/nerdy/artistic kid who got made fun on, left out, or just avoided people and grew up. You bloomed on your own time and have matured, but when you see someone going through what you have, you feel helpless again. You want to help them, but you realize you can\u2019t even help yourself sometimes. You\u2019re just a bleeding heart.  Trampoline - Kero Kero BonitoA cool electropop song about reveling in things that many may see as childish, silly, or a waste of time (like cartoons or video games or collecting dolls) and letting yourself be creative and run away with your ideas and be dreamy and fanciful. Allowing yourself to enjoy your daydreamy moments\u2026 but reminding yourself that you do have to attend to responsibilities of reality, a hard as it is\u2026 The good news is, you just don\u2019t have to live there forever and you can go back to the world of dreams any time you please :P Just don\u2019t forget your real-world duties.  Fellow Feeling (Crystallize\u2019s Edit) - Porter Robinson\u201cI cried. For I didn\u2019t think it could be true; that you and I might have always known one another.\u201d[\u2026]\u201dNow please, hear what I hear.\u201d[\u2026]\u201cLet me explain. This ugliness. This cruelty. This repulsiveness. It will all die out. And now\u2026 I cry for all that is beautiful.\u201d If that\u2019s not an INFP\u2019s view on the world, then I don\u2019t deserve to call myself an INFP. I hear this song and I just imagine an INFP showing the world with magic headphones, how beautiful the world and everyone in it is and/or has the potential to be.  Follow Your Heart - Alan Zachary and Michael WeinerOkay, this is from Cinderella III, a (surprisingly good) movie most people never remember. In any case, I always felt a strong connection to this song, even apart from the movie\u2019s context. I mean\u2026 these lyrics tho. The genesis thought process for every INFP (even ones who won\u2019t admit it) when it comes to being creative and doing the right thing because you know or feel it is right:\u201cWho's to say the rules must stay the same forevermore? Whoever made them had to change the rules that came before.\u201d[...]\u201dThere's a world for the changing and you've just begun. Don't let them tell you \u201cit's simply not done!\u201d  Annnnnnd I think that\u2019s it hahaFinally. The end of the song train :P ",
