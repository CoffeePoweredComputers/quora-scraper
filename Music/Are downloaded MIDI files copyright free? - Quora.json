            "answer_text": "Actually, so long as you don't include the lyrics it is probably within fair-use for more than a couple of reasons. First and foremost, Copyright law cannot be used to prevent another from creating a parody of the original composition. \"Parody\" is one of the areas that is ALWAYS considered \"fair use\" within copyright law, no matter what. Secondly, given the parody doctrine- it follows that if the original release contained lyrics, that the lyrics, not the music by itself, are the \"heart of the work\"- because the music alone is a different breed of animal, since I can arbitrarily assign any lyrics I want to an arbitrary melodic line and thus fall within the parody exception. Among the things that a plaintiff in a copyright lawsuit must allege, is that the \"heart of the work\" was what was in fact \"copied\". Thirdly, a MIDI is not considered, so far, to be a \"fixed and tangible medium\" for purposes of copyright law. In fact, you can't even register a MIDI file with the U.S. Copyright office, but rather you must submit it as either printed sheet music, CD Audio, Tape Audio, etc. The requirement that the work be \"fixed\" means that the work must not be capable of being deleted from the medium it is contained on, as well as that medium itself being \"tangible\". Since the MIDI is a programing standard, It would be argued that the MIDI itself is SOFTWARE and thus subject to a fundamentally different market than the original, which would preclude a plaintiff from collecting copyright damages as a matter of law, anyways, as the plaintiff would not be able to allege that their market shares were damaged to a standard that isn't de minimus. Also, a question to ask is whether or not the assertion of copyright violates any constitutional provision. Example- If I use a copyrighted work during a worship service in a church It isn't a violation of copyright because copyright can't circumvent the anti-establishment or free-practice of religion clauses of the first-amendment. so far there have been no test cases on that point, but it is rare for SCOTUS to allow an interpretation of the law that even smells of violating these two particular clauses.

            "answer_text": "#1: Copyright exists in the original song (songwriters/publishers). You can make a MIDI File for your own personal use and not be liable for royalties or licensing fees. #2: Professional MIDI File (MIDifile) producers like Hit Trax MIDI Files[1] require licensing through royalty collection agencies such as AMCOS[2]. The business pays royalties on every sale, usually paid quarterly to the Agency who will pass on the royalties to the songwriters or copyright owners. End users (musicians, singers, bands etc) can use the MIDIfiles purchased through a professional producer on stage. They cannot re-sell, make copies of, upload and otherwise duplicate the professional MIDI File (MIDIfile) either for free or for profit. This method ensures songwriters and producers receive royalties, much like royalties through record sales. #3: Free MIDI sites: These sites are operating illegally. Many are set up simply to make money through Google ads. The MIDI Files[3] on these sites are unlicensed, often poor quality and anything of good quality is probably stolen from a Professional MIDI File site. I won\u2019t moralise, but as musicians, we might consider supporting our fellow brothers and sisters rather than a nerdy geek who makes neat pocket money from unsuspecting visitors. #4: So, in a nutshell, use common sense and you won\u2019t have copyright lawyers knocking on your door. At this time of writing, MIDI Files remain the most popular form of music support for nearly 95% of cover bands, solo, duo\u2019s and trios using backing tracks. Footnotes [1]: Hit Trax MIDI Files [www.MIDI.com.au] is a popular source of professional and licensed (legal) MIDI File backing tracks. Hit Trax is located in Melbourne, Australia.

            "answer_text": "A more important question is what would happen if you performed that composition without paying a performance royalty MIDI is a tricky situation. It is technically source code for a MIDI controller. You can think of it as something similar to digital sheet music. Sheet music is subject to copyright protection even though the melody it is depicting is in the public domain. The MIDI standard recognizes 128 values per MIDI message. It doesn't define performance characteristics like how a concert pianist would. I can sequence a MIDI file from sheet music without much difficulty and I am not even a musician. If you have sheet music, converting it to MIDI is not too complicated. You believe that someone played the song to create the file. That may not necessarily be true. It is far more likely that the song was sequenced on a computer much like how you would write software code. So I wouldn't be too concerned about the copyright on the MIDI file, but I would be very concerned about acquiring a license to perform the song commercially, especially a melody that would be recognized as a Beatles melody. Deleted obsolete paragraph about the Happy Birthday copyright that has been resolved. ",

            "answer_text": "The only creative works that are copyright free are either: Made by the government, thus public domainReally old, like the 1920'sListed as \"Creative Commons\", which still has a copyright, but the CC part labels the work as something people can use for free, if they ALSO list it as CC.Using a Beatles song as part of any project would infringe on the copyright of the song if the members of the band did not give permission. CD, MIDI file, sheet music, or a movie with this in the sound track. Same for anything made from one of those items. Copyright education is pretty bad worldwide. People are not aware that EVERYTHING has copyright. They just share it or use it without thinking about it. As a copyright owner, I want to say thanks for thinking about it! You are a rare gem. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, assuming the underlying music is also in the public domain; Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp and Meshworks v. Toyota both ruled that ideally perfect conversions of creative works to digital formats are not sufficiently original for copyright; this does not mean that recordings of public domain music are also in the public domain, as recordings form a separate category under copyright law than does what the MIDI file is meant to store, namely sheet music. So, you could use a MIDI file of public domain music as you please, regardless of whether the site says the file itself is under copyright. ",
