            "answer_text": "Well, it is a great way to distract yourself by trying to remember all the lyrics and trying to hit all the notes right with your voice. Plus, maybe you remember a fun time associated with the song. Bonus. I have to tell you that this does not work for me at all. Anxiety shortens my breath and makes me dizzy; singing was the first thing I thought of doing but it did not work for me at all. I do deep breathing instead. ",
