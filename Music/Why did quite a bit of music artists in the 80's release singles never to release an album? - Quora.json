            "answer_text": "In the UK there was an attitude that albums were mainly made by boring old hippy bands. New Wave bands often saw singles as being immediate and fresh, compared to albums which, at worst, could be self-indulgent and overblown. An independent label like Stiff was all about the single. Single sales reached an all time high in the late 70s. Bigger groups like The Clash and The Stranglers would release albums, but for most new artists they either wouldn't be allowed to or would be given minimal promotion as often their fans would only buy singles. This carried on into the 80s. Madness released albums but few of their fans bought them. So record companies would see acts as singles artists (youth) or album artists like Dire Straits (for older people). Kirsty McColl - a great songwriter and singer - released her first single in 1979, but couldn't get an album deal for 10 years! Frankie Goes to Hollywood\u2019s label, ZTT, didn\u2019t agree to them making an album until after their first two singles went to Number 1. The only artists who were selling large volumes of both singles and albums, tended to appeal to young people with conservative tastes and older fans (e.g. Michael Jackson. Wham! etc). For these acts, record companies could release 4 or more singles (or in Thriller\u2019s case: 7) from the same album, to the \u2018singles only\u2019 buyer. Before punk, it would have been unthinkable to release a third single from an album as it would have failed to chart. Fans would have bought the album by then. With Live Aid in 1985, older people started buying music again. Initially they bought albums by older artists like Genesis, Springsteen and Pink Floyd. In addition, these stadium bands were now also appealing to a new younger audience. So, record companies began signing new artists, who would appeal to this wider demographic. Suddenly the singles charts was awash with hotel lobby type music like Simply Red, Wet Wet Wet, T\u2019Pau and Swing Out Sister and it was \u201clike punk never happened\u201d to quote David Rimmer\u2019s classic book.
