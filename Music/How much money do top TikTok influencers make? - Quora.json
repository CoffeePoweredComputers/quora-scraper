            "answer_text": "Great question, and one many are asking themselves these days with the explosive growth of the platform. I recently linked to Fortune\u2019s latest article \u2018TikTok\u2019s 7 Highest-Earning Stars\u2019, detailing last year\u2019s income of the platform\u2019s top creators (i.e. influencers).  Let\u2019s have a look at what they made in the last 12 months: Addison Rae: $5 millionCharli D\u2019Amelio: $4 millionDixie D\u2019Amelio: $2.9 millionLoren Gray: $2.6 millionJosh Richards: $1.5 millionMichael Le: $1.2 millionSpencer X: $1.2 millionMany of the above creators also make money through other brand partnerships or get paid in kind \u2013 i.e. with products. Several also have launched their own product lines. Charli & Dixie D\u2019Amelio, for example, have launched a Morphe makeup line. Above all this, TikTok influencers also get about 2\u20133 cents per 1,000 video views out of TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund. While this does not seem like much, if all of your videos constantly get xx million views, this surely is a nice bonus. Lastly, TikTok also lets its users buy \u201cCoins\u201d which they can use to send Virtual Gifts to live streamers. So in short, the above stated annual revenue numbers should be taken with a grain of salt as they\u2019ll likely be a bit higher.  \ud83d\udca1 If you want to learn more about TikTok influencers and how to get the most out of the platform, check out this Ultimate TikTok Guide.
