            "answer_text": "You can make it a little better. But I\u2019d have to get a better look at the speaker. If it is a long throw speaker with a foam surround, you can make it a little better by putting it into a larger box. This gives more space behind the speaker and lowers the lowest resonance point of the speaker. Many bookshelf speakers do this, either with a sealed box, a ported box, or a horn loaded box. Thanks to AthensProAudio dot gr for the image:  However, matching the speaker to the box is not entirely trivial. All of these schemes in small boxes do make them much less efficient than simply using a much larger speaker in a box tuned for that speaker. I have a pair of Minimus 7 bookshelf speakers, a die cast sealed aluminum box speaker with a 4 inch long throw woofer. They take about 50W to get very loud, versus about 10W for some larger speakers I have that use 8 inch woofers. Thanks to HiFiEngine dot com for the image:  I took a 4 inch long throw woofer, glued it to a 4 inch PVC sewer pipe connector, and experimented with different lengths of 4 inch sewer pipe. About 18 to 24 inches gave me a bass boost, and just a corner of a rag stuck into the end damped the \u201cboing\u201d sound (ringing). So it can be done. I\u2019ve gotten decent sound from tiny 1 inch or so mylar speakers pulled from toys and headphones, simply by using the cap from a hair mousse bottle with the speaker glued onto the end. Or mounting it in a prop that acts like a sealed speaker box. It goes from tinny sounding to pretty reasonable. Not good enough for an electric guitar, I\u2019m just pointing out how simply separating the front from the back of the speaker makes a huge difference in lower frequencies.

            "answer_text": "There is not much you can do without a \u201cmajor\u201d reform on the guitar. It has an amplifier with power: Aprox 0.7W RMS @ 8\u03a9. It does not even reach 1 W of power. And with these kind of specs, there is not much you can do. Even if you use a \u201cbetter\u201d 4\u2033 loudspeaker driver, you will still get a lot of distortion from the amp itself. Even if you manage to get one of the best woofers on the market, for that size, inside the guitar, something like the Revelator 5.5\" Woofer from ScanSpeak  You will still have an under-powered amplifier and a very small box (it needs either a 0.15 cubic foot sealed box, or a 0.3 cubic foot with 1.5\" diameter port). You will notice a bit less distortion, yes, but, you will probably drive the amp into clipping and, although it has very little power, you will still be sending peaks of direct current on to the coil of the driver and that is never good. Eventually, something might break down. Because this driver is 4 Ohms you would also get about twice the power from the amp (approx 1,4W) and you would notice some difference, but it is a waste of money, because the speaker costs almost as much as the guitar itself cost. You would have to create a bigger box for the woofer behind the guitar. Get a better or more powerful battery operated amplifier to fit inside the guitar and get bigger batteries to keep the amp working. To me, the guitar you bought, sounds more like a gadget than anything else. And you should look at it or treat it as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have given the technical answer. I will add that you are kind of missing the point of an Apache guitar. This is basically intended as a novelty item, with a novelty sound. The small speaker is there specifically to give a non-traditional (well, non-bass) bass sound. It\u2019s enough to practice with (and much more convenient than finding an amp) and you will most often find these used for practice, writing, or jamming with acoustic instruments. On a record or live, this would best be used sparingly or as a special effect. (Or, as others have mentioned, you can plug it in and use an amp live but again that kind of defeats the point). In any case, trying to make it \u201cbetter\u201d would effectively make it worse. ",

I will not amplify through anything less than a twelve inch main. Short of a $5k linear array it's basically physically impossible to reproduce frequencies below 200 without large physical displacement. Sell what you have, put it in the closet as a souvenir, save it for future finger exercises with headphones, but don't expect it to ever make a true bass sound. Sorry. ",

But you certainly CAN feed that 1/8\u2033 output into a decent little practice amp with a larger speaker, more power and some better bass. And, of course, using headphones will give you all the bass extension you\u2019d like (and not annoy the family or neighbors no matter the hour) but won\u2019t provide that visceral body resonance of a decent bass speaker. I\u2019d leave that poor little speaker alone and just work around it. ",

To properly amplify a Bass you need heavy duty speakers, personally I think the speaker in this Bass is more of a novelty than anything else. Does it have some way of disengaging the speaker so you can use it through a Bass amp? Taking the speaker out altogether might make it unusable. To be honest I think you would be better off buying another Bass. A good make is Squier, they are reasonably priced and very good value for money I hope this has been helpfull. ",
