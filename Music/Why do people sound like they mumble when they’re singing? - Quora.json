            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t opening their mouths wide enough. In singing, it\u2019s important to get the sound out properly, and the way to do that is to drop your jaw and press your tongue against the backs of your lower set of teeth. That\u2019s how you get all the sound out and sound good. The people who sound like they\u2019re mumbling are most likely not singing quite loud enough and not opening their mouths wide enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Diction. It\u2019s how you pronounce words. When you sing, you have to open your mouth very wide, and over pronounce each word you say. If you were to speak in the same way that you should sing, your consonants would sound very harsh. Singing adds extra stuff for your ears to listen to, and the act of singing changes how words are heard. To compensate for this, you change how you pronounce consonants and vowles. So, that\u2019s why people mumble when they sing. They just don\u2019t realize that singing changes how their voice is heard. ",
