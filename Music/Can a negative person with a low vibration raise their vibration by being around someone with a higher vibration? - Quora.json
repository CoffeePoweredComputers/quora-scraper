            "answer_text": "No. By definition a negative person wouldn't be susceptible to the influence of a positive person and would most likely reject their rosy outlook, much in the same way when we're extremely angry or sad and someone suggest we calm down, or where we might even say \u201cWhat are you so damn happy about\u201d?! As like vibration can only interact with like vibration.. \u201cMisery loves company\u201d\u2026 \u201cbirds of a feather flock together \u201c.. Ect. Now on the other hand, a positive person with a low vibration would be very open to new information, as they would be a place where it would seem to them, that they can\u2019t seem to shake their \u201cbad luck\" or the fact that they give and give and people still treat them poorly. This is simply due to freewill. For not even Jesus, The Buddha or Krishna could free someone from the tumult of their own mind and circumstances if they should not choose so for themselves. L&L ",

            "answer_text": "As Luis says this is possible and the idea that negatives suck up high vibration is sort of true if the high vibration person is less aware, however, if one is only slightly higher there will be a shift likely in both. The higher vibe person may lower to meet in the middle difference, the lower rising a bit too. But also, there is what is called by other races a concept I believe called frequency dominance\u2026? A sufficiently higher frequency person will instanly raise the vibration of a very low vibration person, however, the low vibrational person will likely experience a noticable shift in either their own shadows being brought to the surface for clearing or a purging of those shadow aspects through either tears, diarrohea, screaming, urination, sweating etc\u2026 ",

More likely, your low energy might also lower theirs then neither of you. can be of help to the other. But, yes, a very conscious high vibration person can intentionally help raise the vibrations of others near and sometimes it\u2019s to avoid having their own vibration lowered. It\u2019s not so mysteriious, either. Most of us know people who always cheer others up. Often they\u2019re called \u201cthe life of the party.\u201d We also know those who do the reverse. They\u2019re called party poopers, or those who tend to rain on someone\u2019s parade. it\u2019s actually easy to raise your vibration. Just meditate 15\u201320 mins a day. Keep it up and a high vibe will become your default and you can be the life of the party, too. No worries about setbacks, just keep going and you\u2019ll succeed. ",

There\u2019s nothing vibrating. It can only be used as a metaphor for two people connecting. It\u2019s better to talk specifically about the real thing than to use vague metaphors. So we can have a general mood, optimism, can-do spirit. If you\u2019re around people who cut down ideas, point out challenges, then you may get less done and feel a little depressed. If you\u2019re around people who are encouraging, who themselves take action, question the status quo\u2026 then you may well be inspired to do and grow yourself. ",

Although it is possible. The best for a low vibration energy is to go inside themselves, clean up all the blocked emotions and stress.

Doing that, the person will gain responsibility for his/her life and happiness. ",
