            "answer_text": "When the White album came out, people thought Ringo did his usually great job on drums. Years passed and it was uncovered that Ringo had quit for 2 weeks and Paul did the drumming on at least 4 of the songs. And few if any noticed the difference. His first solo album he played all the instruments including the drums. The album remains a favorite of his fans to this day. The album Band on the Run lost the drummer before recording, and Paul took over as the drummer among his other usual musical duties. It remains his best selling album to this day. Paul was not the drummer in his bands. But when a drummer was needed he filled in quite well. I have no doubt that had he replaced Pete Best and Ringo Starr in the Beatles, he would have developed into a world class drummer, just as he did on bass when Stu Sutcliffe left the band in the early 60\u2019s!

            "answer_text": "Yes. He\u2019s very good. He\u2019s got a natural sense of rhythm but he\u2019s capable of some real flash and spark on the drums as well. This is My Dark Hour by the Steve Miller Band. You can clearly hear Paul on the backing vocals but not many realised that he was behind the drum kit as well. Have a listen to the drumming throughout, it\u2019s definitely Paul\u2019s finest moment behind a kit.  ",
