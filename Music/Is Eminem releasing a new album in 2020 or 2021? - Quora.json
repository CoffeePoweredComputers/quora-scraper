            "answer_text": "He recently released Music To Be Murdered By. In terms of an album in 2021, I don\u2019t know. Eminem is usually very quiet on social media and nobody knows where he is. He usually goes off the grid for sometime until he comes out with a song or an album. In my opinion, Eminem should still make music but the thing is that all of the music today are targeting young audiences. So Eminem\u2019s music wouldn\u2019t impact too much on the young generation. At 47 years old, he accomplished so much and if I was in his position, I would retire. I would also mentor younger rappers and be a mentor. That\u2019s what I would do if I was Eminem. Just like how Dr. Dre mentored Eminem back then. ",
