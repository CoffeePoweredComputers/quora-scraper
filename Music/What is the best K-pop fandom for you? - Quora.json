            "answer_text": "My answer will be totally biased (obviously) since it\u2019s all personal preference, after all. ARMY- okay, stop right there folks, this fandom has been labeled as a toxic fandom and I wouldn\u2019t dare to disagree. But you see, with everything this fandom has been through. Scandal to scandal to scandal, the dedication they\u2019ve had for BTS all these years was just so admirable. This fandom showed me how far love could make a group go.ELF- I\u2019m not a part of this fandom but I like Suoer Junior I just wouldn\u2019t dare to say that I\u2019m an ELF just because I liked SJ. Being a fan is more than just liking one song of a particular artist, it\u2019s somehow deeper than that and I don\u2019t want to insult such connection by saying I\u2019m an ELF. What I admire with this fandom is their maturity of handling things and issues all throughout Sujus career. (except for the Sungmin issue). I admire how patiently they\u2019ve waited for all the members to return from the military. I admire how warm their support is still after years of hiatus (I mean the full group hiatus), how strong they were after all those leaving of some of the members, of how mature they handle about their idols dating lives. I mean, this fandom has been through a lot, from Heechul\u2019s car accident to several more car accident that almost takes Kyuhyun\u2019s life. I don\u2019t know, I just admire this fandom.Shawol- fandom that I think is the strongest. I mean how can this fandom gives encouraging words to their idols when they, themselves wanted to cry hard for the lost Angel. How can they say be strong when their knees trembling. I have no words to say but all my admiration for this fandom.I\u2019m not saying that the fandom needs to experience such heartbreaking events to be the best. Being there, supporting in any way possible you idols or groups you stan was enough to be called the best fandom. And always remember that the best people are those that are capable to love a stranger (stranger- not a relative, I\u2019m using a law term here. Hahaha). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it depends for what you think makes a good fandom In terms of humor and entertainment, NCTzens and Orbits are definitely the best   NCTzens and Orbits are so much fun to interact with for their great sense of humor and their cursed memes (that match with their crackhead group) are so entertaining. They\u2019re quite fun to talk to (unless they\u2019re spamming stan LOONA or NCT).           Sometimes, I walk into their fandom even though I don\u2019t stan their groups only to get traumatized and then walk out (jk, I love y\u2019all). In terms of dedication and passion, 2nd Gen stans and Blinks   The fact that a lot of 1st ad 2nd Gen stans are still with their groups to this day takes DEDICATION. They stuck around with their group for probably about a decade and even after disbandment is still stanning them. The power. As for Blinks, before late 2020, y\u2019all were given the bare minimum by YGE and stuck around your girls until they got finally treated like artists. In terms of the bond with the group and artist, definitely ARMYs and Stays   What I noticed about both ARMYs and Stays was the emotional connection they felt with their group which was unlike a lot of other groups with their fandom that I have seen with their fans. The V-Lives that SKZ has with their fans and the connection ARMYs have with BTS is super cute. Honorable mentions of my favorite fandoms: AhgasesOncesCaratsMOAsSorry if I didn\u2019t mention your respective fandom. These just happen to be my favorite ones. :) ",
