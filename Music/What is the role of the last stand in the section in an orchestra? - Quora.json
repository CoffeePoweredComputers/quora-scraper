            "answer_text": "In most orchestras nowadays, except for the principal (or Concertmaster in the Violin 1 section), orchestra string members rotate seats to some extent, some by person, some by stand. So we who play (I\u2019m usually a Violin 1 though I sometimes sub in the violas.) don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d our seat. There are a very few pieces where the composer asks the last stand to play a solo or duet (Harold in Italy by Berlioz is one such though the score say it is to be played off stage. My stand partner and I did this once, though we remained on stage. Actually in that instance the conductor specified who he wanted to do that.) I\u2019ve done it one other time but I don\u2019t remember what the piece was. ",

            "answer_text": "All of the players in a section have an equal roll. In a violin section of 16 players if one player is sick and fails to show the sound is a little less complex. But it does not matter which stand it is. The effect will be the same. The violins in a violin section all contribute to creating a complex sound through wave interference. The sound is different from one amplified violin because of this. ",
