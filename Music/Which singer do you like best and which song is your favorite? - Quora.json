            "answer_text": "When I listen to music, I\u2019m not just paying attention to a tune. Music absorbs all my attention, all my might, and all my soul. I need lyrics that not only align with my moral code but that inspire me to become a better person and give me new strength and hope and courage to live my day with determination, love, and grace. One artist that always makes me stop and think is Anson Seabra.  Not only do I feel every word of this song echo in every part of my aching, endeavoring soul, but this song reminds me to look at others and remember that they, too, are trying their best - that they have lives that are hurting inside - that they also need as much love and encouragement as I can give them. I\u2019m trying my best. And so are you. ",
