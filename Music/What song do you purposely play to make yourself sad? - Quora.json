            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t, but if I did, it would be the last minute or so of Puccini\u2019s La Boheme. That was the last Saturday opera broadcast from the Old Met (pre-Lincoln Center) in I think it was April, 1966. I was in high school and absolutely sobbed, along with the entire audience at the opera house and the Entire Nationwide Radio Audience on the Texaco network. Three words is all it takes: Marcello: Coraggio. Rodolfo: Mimi! Mimi! ",

            "answer_text": "A lot! Mostly, I listen to Lost Stars performed by Adam Levine. It\u2019s one of the deepest and beautiful compositions I ever had listened to. It reminds me of how we get to love people then, later on, we have to let them go. It\u2019s about the sadness we feel after happiness. It\u2019s about the hopelessness when you try to be hopeful. But this song doesn\u2019t intend to make us feel really sad. I play this to make me feel that I recognize my downfalls, my heartaches, and the darkness. In the end, I just still want to enjoy and rest in the beauty of every pain. :) ",
