            "answer_text": "My first best guess it that you carry a great deal more jaw/tongue tension than you might know. Jaw tension is INCREDIBLY common in our society, and it doesn\u2019t have to become a major TMJ (temporimandibular joint) issue for it to adversely affect your singing. When you do your lip trills, you may be temporarily relaxing your jaw and tongue muscles, but after you stop trilling, they go back to their accustomed postures. I would certainly recommend that you do a daily practice (even a couple of times a day) of firmly rubbing from the area from your inner ear flap all the way in a straight line to the corners of the mouth. If you find that doing this HURTS LIKE A BITCH, then that is good, because you may have found a large part of why your voice is tensing up si quickly. You will find that doing this massage regularly will become less and less painful, and if you do this until it becomes easy, then a big part of your problem will be solved. If, for some reason you find that the joint pain does not go away so easily, THEN it would be a good time to see a speech therapist who deals with TMJ issues and can help to release this muscle much better than you can with self manipulation. Another thing that can accompany the jaw issues is an inability to relax the tongue. The expression to \u201chold one\u2019s tongue\u201d is not a mere expression. In our attempts to be nice people socially, we often have to swallow a great deal of emotions and feelings we need to get off our chest. When we don\u2019t have an outlet for this, it is often the tongue that can carry the buildup of this tension. Now just think about this: the tongue is THE STRONGEST MUSCLE IN THE BODY, and the vocal apparatus is one of the most delicate ones in our body. It is reasonable to expect that a tense tongue is going to have ripple effects on the whole system surrounding it. Trilling is an excellent way to begin loosening the tongue, if you have the coordination to do so. Along with this, I would recommend starting to do yoga and getting some good theraputic massage, especially focusing on the chest, shoulders, neck and head. A holistic approach to relieving one\u2019s tension is going to get you the best and most lasting results. I would not do a lot of vocal work at this time until you can resolve some of these issues. Your body needs to become adjusted to a new (and good!) normal. When it feels like it has become YOU, then reapproaching serious vocal training would be something I\u2019d recommend. ",
