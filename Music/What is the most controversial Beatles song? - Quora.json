            "answer_text": "Sorry I can\u2019t take credit for explaining why these are so controversial but I couldn\u2019t have said it better. They have several that are controversial although many people would never consider as such. However I will add one of my own since it didn\u2019t make the list below, Why Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road. I think we all know what the song is referring to. The story I have always heard is that Paul saw 2 monkeys having sex in the middle of the road and it inspired this song but I believe he was thinking if monkeys can do it in the road why not people. Run For Your Life. The lyrics to this final track on the Rubber Soul album bring about images of a stalker. \u201cI\u2019d rather see you dead, little girl, Than to be with another man. You\u2019d better keep your head, little girl, Or you won\u2019t know where I am. You\u2019d better run for your life if you can, little girl, Hide your head in the sand, little girl, Catch you with another man, that\u2019s the end, little girl.\u201d John Lennon\u2019s lyrics continue by saying he is \u201ca wicked guy\u201d who was \u201cborn with a jealous mind.\u201d Later in the song, Lennon threatens,\u201dLet this be a sermon, I mean everything I said, Baby, I\u2019m determined, That I\u2019d rather see you dead.\u201d Even though this song may have been a tongue-in-cheek exercise to fill out the album, if it were released today it would undoubtedly lead to strong protests from women\u2019s groups. Getting Better. From the seminal 1967 Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band album, Getting Better has the lyrics, \u201cI used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved.\u201d Even though Paul McCartney sang the song, Lennon wrote that part of the lyrics. This is actually an optimistic song about a man who is improving his behavior and outlook on life. In the song Lennon confesses to being a rebellious schoolboy, an angry young man and a wife beater. He says, \u201cMan I was mean but I\u2019m changing my scene. And I\u2019m doing the best that I can.\u201d But those hearing such words today would immediately condemn the track as tolerating spousal abuse. A Day In The Life is the final cut on the Pepper album. The song contains lyrics such as, \u201cI\u2019d love to turn you on\u201d and \u201cFound my way upstairs and had a smoke.\u201d Coming as it did during the \u201cSummer of Love,\u201d the song can clearly be interpreted as containing drug references. In addition, many thought Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, also from the same album, was code for LSD, although the band denied it. Back In The USSR. This lead off song from The White Album has the words, \u201cI\u2019m back in the USSR. You don\u2019t know how lucky you are boy.\u201d The song was condemned by many conservative Americans because it seemed to be praising the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War and the U.S. battle against communism in Vietnam. But in fact, the song was a takeoff on Back In The USA, a jingoistic song by Chuck Berry in 1959. Stylistically the song paid tribute to the Beach Boys and was one of the best cuts on the album. Happiness Is A Warm Gun. This title was taken from a gun magazine that George Martin left in the studio. As one of John Lennon\u2019s contributions to The White Album, the song was interpreted as having sexual connotations about ejaculation. Given how John died at the hands of senseless gun violence, the song has taken on an eerie quality. Why Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it in the road? No one will be watching us. Why don\u2019t we do it in the road?\u201d Those are the total words to this raunchy song from The White Album . Piggies. This song from The White Album, with lines such as \u201cWhat they need\u2019s a damn good whacking,\u201d was interpreted by the disturbed and notorious Manson gang as commanding them to kill. Revolution. Those on the left who were hoping Lennon would join up to man the barricades for a social upheaval were in for a rude awakening. His lyrics in Revolution condemn any use of violence as a means of promoting social change. To disassociate himself from those endorsing communism, he sang, \u201cIf you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, You ain\u2019t going to make it with anyone anyhow.\u201d Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer from Abbey Road had Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer coming down swiftly and fatally on many heads, as Maxwell Edison mercilessly executes anyone who crosses his path or yanks his chain. Okay I\u2019m already receiving comments saying while these are unsavory they aren\u2019t controversial but I disagree. Maybe by today\u2019s standards these lyrics are unsavory at best but you have to keep in mind that back in the 60\u2019s things were much more conservative. Remember when the Doors sang Light My Fire on Ed Sullivan they were asked to change the lyrics \u2018Girl we couldn\u2019t get much higher.\u201d Of course Jim Morrison said he would but didn\u2019t and the Doors never appeared on the show again.

            "answer_text": "Revolution, penned by John Lennon. It shattered \u2014and it still does\u2014 the image of left-sided revolutionary progressive minded intellectuals that many had of the Beatles and Lennon in particular. When everybody was singing about hard rains a-coming, street fighting men, social change about to come (Sam Cooke), and applauding \u201cYoung people speaking' their minds / Getting so much resistance from behind\u201d, the Beatles sat back comfortably, patted on the shoulders of the flower children, called all those guys hard headed idealists and even threatened that they would not \u201cmake\u201d (love) with anyone unless they left those silly banners of Mao. Many were indignant. The Beatles were aligned with the powers to be. Of course, Lennon was very, very smart and actually challenging the hypocrisy of the opportunist social gurus. He was sick of being asked for money to support a new cause every week. The conservative wing sighed with relief, the Fab Four were for peace: \u201cIf you talk about destruction, you can count me out\u201d. And then Lennon went on TV and made it more controversial. He sang: \u201cIf you talk about destruction, you can count me out\u2026 in\u201d. So it was in or out? Were the Beatles for or against violent change? When asked, Lennon said\u2026 he was not sure.
