            "answer_text": "NO THEY ARE NOT and were never designed to be. Sure they do many of the exact same things HOWEVER a laptop can NEVER have the processing power of a full sized pc and this is due to 2 things: 1) HEAT GENERATION and 2) POWER SUPPLY Even student grade pc\u2019s have 250 watts + power supply. COMPUTING POWER IS BASED OFF ENERGY. Business machines have around 400 watts and gaming machines are 500 watts ++. You could never put that into a laptop as it would melt. Originally way back in the 1990s, business\u2019s with sales forces and field agents like engineering and architectural firms needed a way to take notes and drawing into the field in a format where technical items could be adjusted and amended in place. Sales forces and marketing teams needed a way to take presentation out to 3rd party locations. So the laptop was born as AN ACCESSORY TO A FULL PC. Even now these work best as a secondary machine to support a desktop. Personally any one trying to do serious gaming on a laptop is in serious trouble. I was a major player at Combat Arms for 5\u20136 years and all the best players laughed and used the laptop guys for BAIT. I cannot stress enough the heat and power issues. SERIOUS PROCESSING INVOLVES THOUSANDS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIONS PER SECOND and the heat created will shut down your pc in 3 seconds if there is no heat sink connected. You can get severely burned by touching a cpu after just shitting down, 3rd degree or worse. All desktop configurations allow for multiple heat sinks and FAN SUPPORT. Gaming pc cases may have 5\u20137 fan support positions and that is aside from the one/s already on the power supply. The heat and stress are extremely harsh on a laptop and this is why their lifespan is only actually 2\u20133 years of real use before issues begin but compared to a desktop it is much longer. I am using a desktop that is 11 years old. Finally there are add on items you can install into a pc that you simply can not into a laptop. EXTRA RAM, LARGER POWER SUPPLY, A GRAPHIC CARD, A DVD ROM/burner. Laptops used to come with dvd roms but more and more that is ending. The graphics card is a EXTREME MAJOR DIFFERENCE as an actual graphics card that inserts into a pcie slot is in effect A SEGREGATED MOTHERBOARD WITH ITS OWN CPU AND RAM ALL DEDICATED FOR YOUR GRAPHICS. That leaves the rest of your system to be extra resources. A GPU is NOT a graphics card and IS an attempt to improve ON BOARD GRAPHICS. Gaming consoles were the original markets for those and laptops were 2nd. Yes it improves but not even close to a desktop with a good graphic card installed. NOT EVEN CLOSE. On youtube is a game walk through master named THE RAD BRAD, if you listen to him, he will tell you. He may preview a game in a console release for his video, but if he ever has the choice its a pc with graphic card. Some games like Crysis with Cry Engine 3 will simply blow your mind the graphics are so good on a pc with card. ",

            "answer_text": "A laptop is a personal computer that can be easily moved and used in a variety of locations. Most laptops are designed to have all of the functionality of a desktop computer, which means they can generally run the same software and open the same types of files. However, laptops also tend to be more expensive than comparable desktop computers. How is a laptop different from a desktop? Because laptops are designed for portability, there are some important differences between them and desktop computers. A laptop has an all-in-one design, with a built-in monitor, keyboard, touchpad (which replaces the mouse), and speakers. This means it is fully functional, even when no peripherals are connected. A laptop is also quicker to set up, and there are fewer cables to get in the way. You'll also have to the option to connect a regular mouse, larger monitor, and other peripherals. This basically turns your laptop into a desktop computer, with one main difference: You can easily disconnect the peripherals and take the laptop with you wherever you go. Here are the main differences you can expect with a laptop. Touchpad: A touchpad\u2014also called a trackpad\u2014is a touch-sensitive pad that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger. Battery: Every laptop has a battery, which allows you to use the laptop when it's not plugged in. Whenever you plug in the laptop, the battery recharges. Another benefit of having a battery is that it can provide backup power to the laptop if the power goes out.AC adapter: A laptop usually has a specialized power cable called an AC adapter, which is designed to be used with that specific type of laptop. Ports: Most laptops have the same types of ports found on desktop computers (such as USB), although they usually have fewer ports to save space. However, some ports may be different, and you may need an adapter in order to use them.Price: Generally speaking, laptops tend to be more expensive than a desktop computer with the same internal components. While you may find that some basic laptops cost less than desktop computers, these are usually much less powerful machines.Hope It Helps Please Upvote ",
