He had 14 #1 hits, at least one in every decade from the 1950s to the 1990s, starting with 1959's Living Doll, and his most recent coming 40 years later with his version of the Millennium Prayer. He\u2019s sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with total sales of over 21 million singles in the United Kingdom, where he\u2019s the third-top-selling artist behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley. Westlife  Westlife tied Richard with 14 number ones, including their first seven singles, claimed in over just 18 months. Their last #1 was in 2006, a cover of The Rose. They have sold over 45 million records. Meh. I was never a Cliff Richard fan, and until today I\u2019d never heard of Westlife. Source: Artists with the most Number 1 singles on the UK chart ",
