            "answer_text": "This may be offensive but brace yourselves. So I'm not a huge fan of male artists. Not only k-pop, but I also don't listen to any male artists in general. So blackpink got me into k-pop. I first listened to d4 and it literally got stuck in my head. After that I listened to the rest of their songs on Spotify (didn't take much time). Soon I was a blink. Now these are the reasons behind me unstanning them: Kill this love: I anticipated this so damn much. Like, I wouldn't stop watching the teasers. I don't trust anyone who likes that song. Was the comeback iconic? Yes. Was ktl a GOOD song? Nope. As a blink I continued to convince myself it was a good song. But however much u tried, the chorus still seemed empty af to me, trying to fill it up with yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah n rumpapumpapumpapum was just an attempt in vain. I started facing signs of withdrawal. Popularity: I've always been quite angry at this trend. Remember when Justin beiber released baby n sorry? For a long time those two songs used to define mainstream english pop. I used to try to introduce some good artists like Camilla Cabello, Sabrina carpenter and Anne Marie to my friends but they used to say, what's the point? All they say is baby baby n yeah. Even Justin beiber has better songs than that but it's just the popular disliked songs that define him. I soon got really angry at the fact that a group so mediocre at singing, rapping, stage presence became the most popular one. People look at k-pop GG's and the first GG's they see r BP n twice(even twice is a better group at that). There are so many groups that are so much more talent and have more stage presence but still some think BP is the best that there is. The YG hate: rn this irritates me so damn much. I mean yes, I want them to leave YG now, but to say that YG had absolutely no hand in making them what they are now? They don't write their own songs for the most part (next point), don't compose them, and their catchy songs are 80% of the reason why they're famous. Where did those catchy as hell songs come from? Not YG? Who westernized the songs that much so that it sounds more and more attractive to international fans? Not YG? They say that blackpink would've done so much better if they had been in any other group. Huh? YG made them what they are now. Yes, they should leave YG now to be in another agency, but if they had debuted from any other agency, they would've flopped in a year. Song writing: so whenever the topic of Jennie not being a real rapper but rather an idol rapper comes up, because she doesn't write her songs, blinks are like, actually she has written several songs but YG doesn't let her. Okay even though Jennie isn't my fav rapper, I would never bring up that point cuz yes, YG doesn't let her and as a casual listener of 2ne1, I quite know how much he restricted them too. But the point \u201cshe actually is a real rapper cuz she has written over 20 songs\u201d is honestly so stupid. Even I wrote hundreds of songs as a child but were they any good? Did that make me a lyricist? Her lyrics could be a masterpiece, but they also could be bad as hell, so stop bragging or praising Jennie about something you have absolutely no idea about. Even gabbie Hanna has written a lot of poems. Is she a poet now? Are her poems good? No. But she has written poems. Now compare the situations. Yes, you can say that YG restricts them, but to say that she's a real artist cuz she writes her own lyrics, what? Rap group: okay I know YG is best known for making not vocal groups, but rap groups. Cl is a prime example of that. YG tried to create paralles between the two groups. The reason Jennie seems like a really good rapper is that YG gives huge importance to the rappers, and the rap style. Believe me, spitting words fast is not all there is to a good rapper. But people are so convinced that since they sound like that, Jennie is one of the best rappers. No she's not bad, just not the best. I just recently saw this video where this person was comparing their fav groups, mamamoo, CLC and blackpink. So vocal part came and the person basically rated them them the lowest in here. There really aren't that many international moomoos or chesires. So naturally, the comments were filled with blinks saying, \u201cbut can those other group dance around like blackpink while rapping like that?\u201d Yes Karen, they can. Sis I get you're new in k-pop, but yeeun from CLC and moonbyul from mamamoo are known as the best rappers from 3rd gen after soyeon. And yes, they write their own songs n raps, especially moonbyul, who has written whole ass songs and over 45 of her own raps. And also yes, yeeun n moonbyul both can dance on the same difficulty while being extremely stable and in extreme control of the power they put into their raps. Dance: not really a point, not even 1% of the reason why I unstanned them. I listen to english pop, do u really expect me to focus on dance? Music genre: also, not their fault, my preference, I prefer ballads, and stronger vocals. The double standards: so whenever blackpink releases something good or has collabs rare for k-pop artists, it's the girls\u2019 talent. But whenever something bad happens, its YG. You should remember that YG is just as much responsible for creating then as much for ruining them. Why do artists change their stage names when they leave an agency? Because they can no longer be a part of that mononym. In any girl group, the girls are a part of their group name. Their group name also includes the song writers, the producers, the composers, the editors, the managers, etc. No k-pop group is much without the other aspects of teb group name. \u201cHave you seen them at Coachella?????\u201d: Yes, I have. But MY question is, why now? Why did it take a group from the big 3( not talking about any privilege part), after being trainees for so long, 4 years to finally have consistent good stage presence? Sorry, but I don't trust this factor. YG just knows they're screwed in Korea so now all he cares about is international popularity na fans. That awesome performance was just giving it all out for a very specific mandate, which was not, hoping that the fans will enjoy it. You surely won't see this stage presence or performance in any upcoming Korean concert. The girls were probably told to give it their all as if it's there last. Just for some comparison, I'll bring in 2ne1 n mamamoo, as they r both called the queens of stage presence. Even they didn't have taht much of a catchy dance, mamamoo has the simplest choreography except some recent ones. Why do they still manage to excite or captivate the crowd so much? Because of the way they act. They're natural performers, their body never relaxes or leaves character, their faces don't stop having the correct expression even if they're not in the centre. Girl crush: no they didn't create girl crush, no they're not the absolute best at it, no even if I discovered them before they're not the group that first comes to my mind when I think of girl crush. Fandom: most blinks spend hours every day streming Evey one of theur vids and then go bragging about all their MVS having more than a 100 million views. How does that even make sense I- Since internationally BTS n BP are the most popular groups, they often are compared. And since most blinks don't get to bring up vocals or rap, what they bring up us views. I mean, I'm not even a causla listener of BTS but just think about this. BTS, with (idk) over 60 songs, all of them with staggering views. Blackpink, with around 13 songs, with staggering views. Hmmm what are you bragging about honey? YG just celebrated one of their MVS getting 1.1 billion views as if that wasn't the motive all along. As if the fans dont stream their songs day and night? Sue me but I don't think kill this love is that good of a song that you could continuosly listen to it just because u like that song. Most catchy songs get tiring after a while. Visuals: to all the fans who only ever brag about blackpink being the prettiest group and that their visuals are on fire, pls re-evaluate your love for them, do some retrospection. Idk, imagine liking a MUSICIAN ONLY for their LOOKS. No I don't hate them,I just think they r overrated. They frankly do not deserve being the most popular k-pop gg. That's all I'll say. I know I could be attacked for this, but honestly, what are you gonna attack me for? My points weren't superficial, I didn't hate them for their looks, personality, or any lazy dancing bs. I expect quality singing and rapping from a k-pop group and those are only thing I critize them for. Many will say that I have no right to say this cuz I'm probably resting on my couch eating chips. The world doens't work like that honey. For example, politicians. Some adults, people majoring in political science, may know a huge lot about the country. They are not as succesful as the elected parties, so does that take away for them the right of stating their opinion? Just think bout that. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to word it like this. I love Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo, and Ros\u00e9. But I\u2019ve come to hate BlackPink. Let me explain. I\u2019ll start with their music. I think it\u2019s fun, thrilling, and easy to enjoy. But that\u2019s it. They seem to be following the same formula now, even more so with their recent music. It\u2019s repetitive, but not in a good way now (my personal opinion). Of course, I\u2019m not blaming the members since they don\u2019t write their own music (though I really would like to hear some of their own - I\u2019ve heard Jennie tried to, but the producers or whatever threw it out). Speaking of though, Solo is one of their - or rather, Jennie\u2019s - most recent tracks that I actually really like. It\u2019s not overly dramatic like Kill This Love was, but had the same feel to it in a contrastingly softer way. My point is, I\u2019ve simply come to prefer other artists and their music. Now, onto the members themselves. The girls are lovely people. Period. They\u2019re all beautiful, funny, charming, and talented. But, I so desperately want them to disband, or at least, get away from YG Entertainment. They have so so much potential, but they\u2019ve been treated like s**t, and it thoroughly bothers me. They scarcely get comebacks, which I personally didn\u2019t like since other artists are putting out plenty of content regularly - I figured I might as well draw my attention to these artists instead. The members are also subjected to some of the worst criticism I\u2019ve ever seen in any industry. For example, the (inexcusable and unjustifiable) accusations against Jennie of \u2018being lazy\u2019 and \u2018being a spoiled brat\u2019, and the racism against Lisa due to her Thai nationality (some of the comments from netizens that I\u2019ve read truly disgusted me). Not to mention solo stans (the ones that love one member and hate the rest) who are just\u2026the worst. Like, can we just take a look at these posts:       Those last two just make my blood boil. I hate the fact that this last Blink tried to gather multiple fandoms together to hate on BTS. It makes real Blinks and VIPs, iKONICs, SONEs, Shawols, and EXO-Ls look like awful and horrible people, when they just aren\u2019t. The second-to-last one? \u2026Do I even need to explain this one? It\u2019s just so f**king disrespectful to Jonghyun, it\u2019s disgusting. With posts like these becoming more frequent as the fandom grew, I figured that I couldn\u2019t be a part of this community any longer. Streaming culture just needs to stop. Views genuinely don\u2019t matter to me anymore, and this is coming from an ARMY. I\u2019m in this for the music, not for being part of a \u2018loyal and powerful\u2019 fandom for \u2018popular\u2019 artists. I will never hate BlackPink for the members because they are amazing, and more importantly, innocent people who are simply victims of an unfair industry and society. I sincerely think Jennie is suffering from depression and/or anxiety, and I fear for her and I hope she gets some help. After what happened to Sulli and Goo Hara last year, I never want to see another incident in this industry again where someone suffered because they didn\u2019t get the support they needed. ",
