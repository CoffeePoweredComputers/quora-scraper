            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question to answer correctly, Jin likes lobster, that\u2019s what I found for his favourite. Suga says he like \u2018Korean dishes\u2019 which probably means he prefers to eat Korean food. He hasn\u2019t really named a favourite though. J-hope also says he likes any Korean dish, he\u2019s really not picky about that, but he has said in interviews that he likes kimchi fried rice, he also likes hamburgers. And sprite. What did you think I wasn\u2019t gonna mention that? RM just says steak. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever said how he likes it cooked but I know he likes steak. Jimin actually have a specific favourite food, he said he likes pork BBQ and bean paste soup. I dare you to try to say that ten times fast. V said that he likes black bean sauce noodles, he had also said that he loves Panda Express. Jungkook, I laugh at his answer. He just said meat. But I do know he loves duck meat. This is all I could find so it could have changed but I hope this is correct. ",

            "answer_text": "I already answered that in another tread so I\u2019ll just copy and past my previous answer: Not really sure. I know RM loves this thing called black noodles. He said so himself. He used to sneak out to order them and eat them very fast before returning to the dorm without management noticing. He was talking so fondly about them that I wanted to try them. But the guy at the Korean and Japanese food store here in Rotterdam didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. Maybe I have better luck in the Korean supermarket in The Hague. Jungkook eats everything, as long as it\u2019s food. He said so himself. He is a very big fan of meat. A meatoholic if you will. Man, that boy can pack away lots and lots of meat! He can pack away a lot of food anyway. V, Suga and Jungkook like panda express a lot. I think the rest too, but these three are really big fans. They all like in and out, churros, chicken, pizza and Korean food. There is this Korean chicken place they like a lot. I forgot the name but according to Namjoon it\u2019s like the Korean KFC. Korean Fried Chicken, lol! Namjoon hates seafood and is even allergic to it I think, not sure. Yoongi is a big fan of lamb skewers and turned Kookie into one too. ",
