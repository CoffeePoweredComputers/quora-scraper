            "answer_text": "Hey! I am going to go through in winning order btw. Wonyoung- Rocket PunchWonyoung can pull off cute concepts extremely well. In every comeback, she shines in the center position. She is really good at everything, and I think she would fit in perfectly. I think the positions would be- Suyun- Main Vocalist Yunkyoung- Main Vocalist, Main Dancer Sohee- Center, Main Rapper, Vocalist Yeonhee- Lead Vocalist, Rapper, Lead Dancer Dahyun- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Juri- Lead Vocal, Lead Rapper, Lead Dancer Wonyoung- Lead Rapper, Center, Lead Dancer, Vocalist 2. Sakura- Momoland I don't know why, but Sakura gives off a JooE vibe. She has that quirky personality, yet mature a little. She would be a good extra center for the group, and she would fit in with their personalities too. I think the positions would be- Hyebin- Main Rapper, Vocalist Jane- Main Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper Nayun- Vocalist, Rapper JooE- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Lead Rapper, Center Ahin- Main Vocalist Nancy- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Sakura- Lead Rapper, Center 3. Yuri - Mamamoo Yuri has a strong and deep voice, which would fit with Mamamoo. I know Mamamoo is 3rd gen, but she fits in so well! She is a great vocalist and would work with the handheld mic situation. The positions would be- Solar- Main Vocalist Wheein- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Moonbyul- Main Rapper, Main Dancer Hwasa- Lead Vocalist, Rapper Yuri- Lead Vocalist 4. Yena- Everglow Yena is a little ducky who can pull off girl crush, who would've thought. She is great at performing, and she knows the girls already (trained with all of them) She would do girl crush v well in my opinion Mia- Main Vocalist, Main Dancer Sihyun- Main Vocalist Yiren- Center, Vocalist Yena- Main Rapper, Lead Vocalist, Main Dancer Aisha- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Lead Rapper Onda- Vocalist E.U- Main Rapper, Vocalist 5. Yujin- Red Velvet Yujin is a very versatile performer. She can pull off cute, mature, girl crush, etc. Red Velvet doesn't have a defined concept, and Yujin would fit like a puzzle piece there. I think the positions would be- Wendy- Main Vocalist Seulgi- Lead Vocalist, Main Dancer Yeri- Lead Rapper Irene- Center, Main Rapper, Lead Dancer Joy- Lead Vocalist, Rapper Yujin- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer 6. Nako- Weeekly Nako would totally fit a group that does cute. I mean in PD48 she even says \u201cI'm the cute one here!\u201d She would fit Weeeklys concept PERFECTLY. The positions would be- Monday- Main Vocalist, Main Rapper, Lead Dancer Soojin- Main Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper Jiyoon-Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Rapper Soeun- Main Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Rapper Jahee- Lead Rapper, Vocalist Jihan- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Zoa- Rapper, Vocalist Nako- Lead Vocalist 7. Eunbi- EXID Eunbi is a strong vocalist that has amazing pipes. She would fit in this mature concert, vocal-oriented (with L.E being an amazing rapper) group. Roles- Solji- Main Vocalist L.E- Main Rapper, Lead Dancer Hani- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Hyerin- Lead Vocalist Jeonghwa- Main Dancer, Lead Rapper, Sub- Vocalist Eunbi- Main Dancer, Lead Vocalist, Center 8. Hyewon- (G)I-DLE Hyewon would work mature concepts. Though having hard choreo, I think Hyewon would flourish after a comeback here. The positions would be- Miyeon- Main Vocalist Minnie- Main Vocalist Soojin- Main Dancer, Lead Vocalist Yuqi- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Soyeon- Main Producer, Main Rapper, Main Dancer, Vocalist Shuhua- Vocalist, Lead Dancer Hyewon- Lead Rapper, Vocalist 9. Hitomi- Fromis_9 Hitomi can pull off a cute concept as good as Chaeyeon can dance. Like her voice is PERFECT for this group. Positions- Saerom- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper Hayoung- Lead Vocalist, Main Dancer Gyuri- Lead Vocalist Jiwon- Main Vocalist Jisun- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Center Seoyeon- Main Rapper, Vocalist Chaeyong- Main Dancer, Lead Rapper, Vocalist Nagyung- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper Jiheon- Vocalist Hitomi- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper 10. Chaewon- Oh My Girl I don't know why again, but she fits so well into a song like Nonstop. It has mature tones, with a hint of cute, just like Chaewon when she performs. Positions: Hyojung- Main Vocalist Mimi- Main Rapper, Main Dancer, Sub Vocalist YooA- Main Dancer, Lead Vocalist Seunghee- Main Vocalist Jiho- Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer Binnie- Sub Vocalist Arin- Lead Dancer, Sub Vocalist Chaewon- Main Vocalist, Lead Dancer, Rapper 11. Minju- Cherry Bullet Minju is good at cute concepts but great at mature. Cherry Bullet is that. She is perfect for this. Positions: Haeyoon- Main Vocalist Yuju- Lead Vocalist, Lead Rapper Bora- Main Vocalist Jiwon- Main Rapper, Lead Vocalist Remi- Main Dancer, Vocalist Chaerin- Main Dancer, Vocalist, Rapper May- Lead Dancer, Vocalist Minju- Center, Lead Rapper, Lead Vocalist 12. Chaeyeon- Solo Chaeyeon doesn't belong in normal groups. IZ*ONE is different because they are full of dancers, but Chaeyeon doesn't have that group feel. Her rapping, dancing, and singing skills are off the charts! If I had too, she would be in ITZY. Positions: Ryujin- Main Rapper, Lead Dancer Yeji- Lead Vocalist, Rapper, Main Dancer Yuna- Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Lead Rapper Lia- Main Vocalist Chaeyeon- Main Dancer, Main Vocalist, Lead Rapper, Center Chaeryeong- Main Dancer, Lead Vocalist, Lead Rapper Thanks for reading and stan IZ*ONE and all these groups :).
