            "answer_text": "To put it as clearly and concisely as possible, rock music is all about the backbeat. \u201cBackbeat\u201d basically means putting the emphasis/accent on a beat in the measure where one typically wouldn\u2019t expect to find it. If you know even the basics of music theory, the emphasis is on the second and fourth beats of the measure, rather than on the first. If you know nothing about music theory (and that\u2019s fine), pick a famous rock and roll song, sing it softly to yourself, and notice where the emphasis lies. An easy example to see this is the introduction to the Rolling Stones \u201cGet Off My Cloud.\u201d Listen to Charlie Watts\u2019s drumming: dum-DUM-dum-DUMDUM dum-DUM-dum-DUMDUM or one-TWO-three-FOUR one-TWO-three-FOUR ",

            "answer_text": "Like all popular forms that descend from the African diaspora, rock is a delivery system for drum grooves. Everything else\u2014lyrics, melodies, chords, arrangement, production techniques, etc\u2014is decoration. The backbeat isn\u2019t the only drum groove that goes well with rock, there are others that work well too. But there has to be some kind of Afrodiasporic groove, otherwise the music isn\u2019t doing its job. ",
