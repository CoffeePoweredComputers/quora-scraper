            "answer_text": "A band that has gone 30+ years without a loss in the quality of their music? I immediately thought of these guys when I saw this question: Los Lobos This outstanding band have been together for 47 years. 47 years! Not only have they maintained the quality of their music, they've only gotten better. We've seen them twice. The first time was outdoors in Nashville. The city hosts a free Wednesday evening event called Uptown Mix.The \u201cvenue\" was nothing more than city owned property near Vanderbilt University - and a stage. Los Lobos played there on August 4, 2004. And we were fortunate enough to be there. About halfway through it started to rain. I've never seen a crowd less bothered by a downpour. We were too busy enjoying the spectacular music. It was as if the rain only added to our enjoyment. I will never forget dancing with the rain that night. It was magic. There are only a handful of musicians or bands we've seen who sound better live than on their studio albums; Steely Dan (seven times; they're my favorite), The Cure (twice), Annie Lennox (twice as well), and Harry Connick Jr (six times) are a few who come to mind. And my beloved Los Lobos are another. The second time we saw them was a dream come true for me. My husband scored four tickets for an intimate show at a place called Bell's Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo. . . . and a Meet & Greet with the band, May 25th, 2018. The show did not disappoint. The small venue had outstanding acoustics and the band was in their usual top form. I was in my glory and \u2026 well, did I shed a tear or two of happiness throughout the evening? You bet I did. It's all over my face in the pictures below:  \u2b06 Left to right: Saxaphonist Steve Berlin, my dear friend Andrea, drummer Enrique \u201cBugs\" Gonzalez, lead guitarist, vocalist, accordionist, violinist David Hidalgo, a tearful and ecstatic me. Where is the other lead guitarist and vocalist Cesar Rosas? The one with the perpetual sunglasses? He was at the bar having a beer with my husband. I got a picture with him but it didn't turn out. I did, however, get him to take off his shades for a minute when I asked him if his sunglasses were prescription. Having been a Certified Optician for 30 years, I'd often wondered. He said, \u201cNo, I just like wearing them.\u201c He took them off and handed them to me as if to say \u201cHere, see? .. No prescription.\u201d A classic Ray Ban. Which I already knew. \ud83d\ude0e But he did sign my DVD Live at the Fillmore 2004 . . . a spectacular performance that I could listen to every day. Especially two songs, Luz De Mi Vida (Light of my Life) and Chains of Love, on which David Hidalgo plays the most mesmerizing and haunting violin solo I've ever heard, give me goosebumps and bring me to tears. They're so beautiful.  \u2b06The illegible autograph of the shaded one ..  \u2b06 Me and Bugs . . . He was a bit of a flirt. And it wasn't above me to flirt right back. . . .  \u2b06Okay, I wasn't going to post this one because, well, it's a terrible picture of me. My friend's husband snapped it before I was ready. But I couldn't leave out bassist Conrad Lozano, the happiest guy I've ever met. Just look at his wonderful smile; it's ever present, even onstage. Another magical evening because of music .. and a band who's aged like fine wine.  \u2b06 Me \u2019n Andrea \u2026 After the show the gal who had been at the table next to us came up to me and said \u201cI hope you don't mind me saying this but I really like your top, especially the neckline . . . . It's like a tiara for your tits\u201d! Of course I didn't mind; I thought it was hilarious. And it gave me and Andrea an alliterative running joke .. It's now called my Tit Tiara Top. ",

            "answer_text": "30 years? Try 53 years. Boz Scaggs was in the Steve Miller Band 1967\u201368, contributing to two epic albums, Sailor and Children of the Future. He went solo in 1969 and recorded his first album for Atlantic in Muscle Shoals, AL with Duane Allman.  Scaggs released two albums in 1971, Moments and Boz Scaggs & Band, wherein he wrote most of the songs, but never received much acclaim even though they had radio hits like \u201cWe Were Always Sweethearts\u201d (#61) and \u201cNear You\u201d (#96). These albums were followed up by My Time in 1972 which produced the minor hit, \u201cDinah Flo\u201d. The majority of the songs on these albums were penned by Boz Scaggs. Next came the album Slow Dancer in 1974. While it failed to chart any hits, it received a Gold Record and made it to #81 on the album chart. Many Boz fans consider it his best.  Scaggs had his greatest success with 1976\u2019s Silk Degrees, containing hits like \u201cLowdown\u201d (#3), \u201cLido Shuffle\u201d (#11), and \u201cIt\u2019s Over\u201d (#38), propelling Scaggs into the popular limelight.  1977 brought us the albums Down Two Then Left (#11), then Middle Man in 1980 (#8), and Other Roads in 1988, each filled with excellent songs and music like \u201cJoJo\u201d (#17) and \u201cLook What You\u2019ve Done to Me\u201d (#14). So we\u2019re 21 years and 10 solo albums into his career and he\u2019s still very relevant on the music scene.  Scaggs took a hiatus from recording while operating a restaurant and a music nightclub in San Francisco. Luckily for us, 1988 brought us Other Roads (#11), 1994\u2019s Some Change, and the unplugged Japanese release, Fade Into Light in 1996.  Scaggs returned to his blues influenced roots with 1997\u2019s Come On Home, followed by a more polished album, Dig, released on 9/11/2001 (an unfortunate coincidence that hampered the album\u2019s success). I heard him say once that he felt Dig was his best work. Scaggs then switched genres to record two albums of jazz standards, But Beautiful in 2003 and Speak Low in 2008. These albums received rave reviews from the jazz community.  In 2013 Scaggs once again returned to his Texas musical roots with the release of Memphis (#17), followed in 2015 with A Fool to Care (#54). These albums are drenched in roots music, and were a critical success. So were now 46 years into his solo career and he\u2019s still going strong. His last release, 2018\u2019s Out of the Blues completed the trilogy of fine blues and R&B albums.  Boz Scaggs still performs about 50 nights a year, and is held in high acclaim by critics and fans alike. After 53 years, Boz continues to reinforce his reputation as one of America\u2019s finest recording and performing artists. ",

His return to playing in 1975 produced another 7 years of arguably even higher standards.Thelonious Monk from his ground breaking work starting with Blue Note in 1947 to Prestige & Riverside in the 50s, commercial success with Columbia in the 60s and bowing out in 1971 is just shy at 24 yearsAs is pianist Bill Evans, whose life was dedicated to music from his debut in 1956 to his early death in 1980.King Crimson & Robert FrippPere Ubu few if any duds from 1975 until 2019Frank Zappa30 - 40 Years: Pianist Keith Jarrett since 1968 rarely if ever dips in quality in solo or group releases.Jazz Guitarist Pat Metheny since 1975 has released multiple 5* albums since. Over 40 years. Singer Nina Simone,Guitarist Paco di Lucia50+ Years: Guitarist Jim Hall played with multiple bands including Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Giuffre, Art Farmer, Sonny Rollins and Paul Desmond and solo released nothing but quality throughout his career from 1955 until 2013 - Over 50 years of high standards and quality South African Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim recorded his first album in 1960 and is still playing live. He left South Africa in 1962 due to Apartheid and has excelled as a band leader and solo performer since. A musician of the highest integrity for over 60 years who follows his own musical path integrating the music of his birthplace with jazz traditions that span a century. He is a particularly mesmerising solo performer capable of improvising for over an hour while captivating the audience. Mannenberg Bassist Charlie Haden started out on record in Ornette Coleman\u2019s startling new Jazz Quartet in 1958 until 61, pianist Danny Zeitlin\u2019s in the mid 60s, Keith Jarrett\u2019s band before leading his own Liberation Music Orchestra from 1969. Parallel with this he was a collosus of goodwill throughout his career regularly speaking out against social injustice, racism, facism & apartheid. His own Quartet West band\u2019s work from 1986 into the 90s was yet another highlight. Whether as a band leader, composer, band member or masterful accompanist in a duo setting, he is one of few artists that released no duds in his long eventful career that came to end in 2014 after well over 50 years of quality.Sun RaDuke EllingtonIn the jazz world there are several more too, l like rock but the life long integrity of many jazz musicians is something to behold.

            "answer_text": "Many rock artists have been active for 30 years or more, like KISS, Aerosmith, Yes, and Van Halen, but they\u2019ve gone through high highs and low lows. Two bands that I first saw together have, in my opinion, maintained a high level of quality across the decades: Rush and Marillion. Most of you will know Rush, and I don\u2019t think I need to explain further. Few of you will know Marillion, beyond maybe their one \u201chit,\u201d 1985\u2019s \u201cKayleigh.\u201d However, they\u2019ve put out 19 albums since 1983, 4 with their original lead singer and 15 with their current one. The early stuff was a mix of Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel-era Genesis and complicated Rush-like lyrics\u2014very \u201cproggy.\u201d The later stuff is more a mix of Floyd, Radiohead, Talk Talk, Coldplay and Muse\u2014more emotional both musically and lyrically. However, their entire catalog features great musicianship, heartfelt lyrics and emotional heft. From the Wikipedia page on the band: In 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s. That pretty much sums it up. Their 2016 album \u201cF.E.A.R.\u201d ranked 22nd on Loudersound\u2019s \u201c50 Best Rock Albums of the 2010s\u201d alongside bands like Metallica, the Black Keys, Halestorm, Ghost, and Foo Fighters. The 50 best rock albums of the 2010s ",

            "answer_text": "I was at Heathrow airport waiting for my flight home. I got through security really fast, so I had some time to kill. I walked into a store that was selling CDs, and there it was:  I was excited because I didn\u2019t know Paul Weller, maybe my favorite artist from the punk era, had a new record out. Wild Wood was released almost 20 years after The Jam\u2019s (Weller\u2019s first band) first release. And what a record it was. Listen to the first track, Sunflower:  There\u2019s not a bad track on the whole record. Except for a small down period when he was leading his second band, The Style Council, Weller had been putting great music out for close to twenty years at this point. Listen to this track, Away From The Numbers, off the Jam\u2019s debut record, In The City, in 1976:  Now, over 40 years into his career, Weller is still producing great music. His latest record, 2018\u2019s True Meanings, is another classic. This time the focus is more acoustic. Here\u2019s the first track, The Soul Searchers:  So, for an artist that started out producing punk rock, then moved to soul music, then to roots rock, then to acoustic, Weller has continued growing and changing as an artist. I can\u2019t wait to see what he does next. ",

I would not argue with the folks who have mentioned Miles Davis, Richard Thompson or Tom Waits\u2026 and even though I am a massive fan of both Frank Zappa and King Crimson I would argue that there were periods of time where they were on the top of their games, and perhaps not as much so during the end years. Zappa\u2019s output toward the end of his career was in compilations of concert material from his career and the occasional album of new (forgettable) material. King Crimson, to my mind, has become nothing more than a very special and well-rehearsed tribute band, and if you need proof just look at one of the stops on their upcoming summer tour where they will be playing Wolf Trap National Park just outside of DC, with The Zappa Band as supporting act\u2026 them being an ACTUAL tribute band. However, one gentleman who has managed to stay on top of his game is Andy Partridge. With XTC he moved from Angry White Guy Punk into all types of melodic pop, aggro-rock, and a bit of near-prog rock. As a collaborator and solo artist since the demise of XTC he has stayed focused on quality over quantity. That he is not rich and famous is a crime even as two or three of his songs are actually rather well-known. \u201cDear God\u201d is one that most people have heard, perhaps as a cover by Sarah MacLachlan, or through the saturation on MTV back in the day. \u201cMayor of Simpleton\u201d and perhaps \u201cThe Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead\u201d got good play as well. It is interesting for me to note that those who have allowed me to play XTC/Partridge tunes for them have expressed great interest, generally along the lines of \u201cwhere has this guy been all my life?\u201d Check out his recent collaboration with Robyn Hitchcock to see what I mean. Completely in command of his amazing talents. ",

Keeping a group together, all the same members for that long, can\u2019t even be compared to a solo musician doing the same thing, the difficulties in group dynamics being what they are. Rush was a progressive rock band, composed of Alex Lifeson (guitarist), Geddy Lee (bass, keyboards, vocals) and \u201cthe Professor\u201d Neil Peart (drums, lyrics). From 1974 up until just a few years ago, they continued to sell albums and play concerts to ever-increasing fans. Rush had 24 gold, 11 platinum, 3 multi-platinum records, putting them fifth in most consecutive studio albums behind the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Kiss and Aerosmith. Peart was well-known for his exceptional drumming, with fans and critics alike voting him as the greatest rock drummer in many polls. Not only that, but he also wrote the majority of Rush\u2019s lyrics, usually of fantasy, science fiction and libertarian philosophy. In fact, one of their most successful live shows, which was in Rio de Janeiro of 60,000, the Brazilians sang the lyrics to almost all their songs (in english) and in interviews of the concert-goers, they were speaking of how Rush had taught them about freedom and the spirit of man. Here\u2019s a taste of their \u201cRush in Rio\u201d tour and dvd. The road crew ran into traffic on the way from the last concert and were so late, fans were already filling the stadium, they had no time for a sound check and Rush started the concert cold\u2026 and still played flawlessly.

My vote \u2014 but hardly the only candidate \u2014 goes to Iron Maiden. They\u2019re in their 45th year, and while they\u2019ve had ups and downs as well as stylistic variations, I don\u2019t know anyone who says their quality has diminished. Someone might not like their music now compared to, say, 1982 \u2014 but it\u2019s not because it\u2019s musically worse. It\u2019s just different. If anything, their music is much richer, more complex, and interesting than it was in years past. Their last album (their 15th studio album) was arguably their most ambitious and received huge acclaim. Rush is another. I was less of a fan of their later music, but there was certainly never an overall decline in quality in their 40+ years. Thanks for the A2A!

Musicians: Keith Jarrett, McCoy Tyner, Dwight Yoakam Pat Metheny: Not only has his music quality consistently ranged from really good to incredible, he\u2019s also done it while trying different styles of music, playing different instruments and playing on an array of projects as a guest. Bands: Radiohead, Steely Dan, Beastie Boys, Van Halen Rush: They don\u2019t have a bad record (and I\u2019m not saying this because they are my favorite band). I\u2019m being pretty objective having heard all their albums. They\u2019ve been very consistent especially for band thats released as many records as they have and tried different styles & different sounds. Many vary in quality but none are bad. Some fans might hate certain records or time periods but overall they have been very consistent. They finished out their career with a couple of strong records. ",

It\u2019s also really hard to stay relevant. As far as bands go, my choices are: Rush - who did an amazing job with the same lineup for so many years and very little decline in technical skills. You can hear the difference in Geddy\u2019s voice over the years but even so he is really an A-lister. Alex sounds a wee bit cleaner on earlier live performances but again they are crazy good. I would say I didn\u2019t really like the songwriting after the mid-90s though.The Cure. Haven\u2019t seen them lately, but great for many years.Solo: Joe Satriani. It\u2019s not quite fair to compare a solo musician to bands. But neither his playing nor songwriting have declined for over 30 years. ",

Did you know the Who\u2019s hit \u201cYoung Man Blues\u201d was actually written by Mose? Imagine my pleasure at hearing he was doing a gig at a club in Germantown. I went there and was waiting at the ticket table when this little old guy came by and tripped on my heel, and it was Mose! He said \u201cExcuse me\u201d and all I could say was \u201cSure, any time!\u201d I found a seat in the front row (this was a small club, I mean really small), and noticed that his backup players included a string bass player I had played with in Jenkintown, so I was chatting with him when Mose came in and sat down at a keyboard so close to my seat I could practically reach out and touch him. He started the set with no long intro, just told the backups \u201cWe\u2019ll start with #17 please\u201d, and they all launched into #17 in his playbook, whatever that was. Took the applause, then said \u201c#4\u201d and they played #4. Then he said \u201cBlues in E\u201d and they played blues in E. And he did that the whole set. Less than a minute between tunes, and little or no intro for any of them. And he kept it up for 90 minutes. And most of the material was new to me; he had been composing new stuff during the intervening 50 years. I left after the first show, but he had a whole second set to play that night. What a powerhouse. That was in 2012 I think, so he must have been 85. Died in 2016. ",

Not always to all taste but the music was usually pretty good. The Magnetic Fields have had a pretty solid career at this point but not sure if it\u2019s up to 30 years yet. Lots of jazz musicians kept their relevancy for that period of time. A few have already mentioned Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, two of the most important. I\u2019d put Charles Mingus in there, as well, as likely the superior composer to the two in many ways. I think the all-time king of long-term quality is Duke Ellington. His late 1920s work was sterling and well-composed jazz and he continually evolved throughout his career, staying on or sometimes predicting trends. No other swing artist from his period, for example, put out an album as exploratory and engaging as \u201cThe Money Jungle,\u201d which featured the incredible contributions of Mingus on bass and Max Roach on drums.

Within less than a decade, they paved the way for \u2018shock rock\u2019, opening doors for Alice Cooper, Bloodrock, David Bowie, the Velvet Underground and Iggy and the Stooges. This was the segue into the Punk Revolution. Black Sabbath was accused of being Satanist, which was as absurd as David Bowie being confirmed as a Martian. Only Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s mental disorders sent him over the edge often enough to have him discharged from the band. The Oz began touring solo and Sabbath went through a prolonged episode of lineup changes. Yet, decades later, they reformed in their mid-life and literally did not skip a beat. Tony Iommi has to be credited as one of the greatest guitarists in rock history. His immortal riffs helped define the genre and carve a niche for Black Sabbath. Yet Ozzy\u2019s stage persona and psycho lyrics created an unforgettable musical concept. They played a farewell gig after three decades, and it was a trip back through time that proved they had passed the test. ",

There are others. I think it also important to distinguish between continued quality and continued popularity and market success. They rarely go hand in hand. ",

Rush made many albums and toured for 40 years, always with creativity, excellence, and professionalism, until their final tour (RIP Neil Peart). I have to bring up the case of David Crosby, who, in his 70s, has made 5 compelling albums and written some of the most meaningful songs of his life, and backed them up with solid live work. Ian Anderson continues to tour with Jethro Tull and on his own, record, and, despite the fact that he can\u2019t play the flute on one leg anymore, is well worth your time and ticket money. Earth, Wind, and Fire still tour, and will still get you up and dancing in the aisles.

Not sure if the shows scheduled for this May are going to happen, but he's always doing something musical that can put a smile on the face of an aging musicial curmudgeon such as I. If you haven't listened, give him a try! ",

He fired something like 40 different band members over the years, and in the next 4 decades knocked out about 35 full length albums. He passed away in 2019, and while I hardly know all their work, right up til the end he was kicking ass and taking no shit, and making great stuff for right now and forever. A true original. ",
