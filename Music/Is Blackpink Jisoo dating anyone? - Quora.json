            "answer_text": "Like nothing is officially announced. But still as she is the visual of BLACKPINK she is the member who gets shipped the most. She got shipped with Bts's Jin and V. She also got shipped with Exo's Suho. She also got shipped with Got7's Jinyoung and NCT127\u2019s Doyoung. Bts's V, Got7's Jinyoung and NCT127\u2019s Doyoung were the host with her. But I think that BTS's V interactions with her are really realistic. They have the same personality, both have breathtaking visuals and they have kind of the same deep voice. They were spotted wearing same watches, bracelets, caps, etc. Jisoo also matches V's ideal type list. V also has other ships like taennie, taetzu, taerene, etc \u2026but I don't find them real. Even V laughed when someone shouted VSOO when he was hosting with her. So there can be chances. But still it's not officially announced and YG ENT. also has a \u201cdating ban\u201d rule..btw also when they smile their lips form heart   ",
