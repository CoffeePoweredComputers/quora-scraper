            "answer_text": "Really? No, but for real. Let\u2019s be truly honest. REALLY? A FAMOUS EMO RAPPER? If for famous you mean a rapper like XXXTENTACION, Lil Peep, Lil Uzi Vert, Young Thug, Lil Yachty, and all of those outcasts of society, then, sure. I can help. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know what the term of \u201cEmo Rap\u201d means, it\u2019s basically subgenre of hip hop, fusing styles used in hip hop music with lyrical themes and vocals commonly found in emo music, as well as elements of other closely associated rock genres such as indie rock, punk rock and nu metal. In other words, the Soundcloud mainstream feel-sad music. In any case, you don\u2019t know about XXXTENTACION (one of the major examples when referring to \u201cemo rap\u201d), he was was an American rapper and singer who made a lot of controversies within his musical career. (For example, the \u201chitting a pregnant girlfriend\u201d thing, drug possession, stabbing people, getting into fights, etc).  (Yeah, the guy above). Now, let\u2019s make something clear. There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u201cemo rap.\u201d At the contrary, I truly believe anyone should do, think, and listen to whatever they want (as long as it\u2019s not hurtful nor bad to others). The question was: I want to become a famous emo rapper. What do I do? Okay, okay\u2026 Well, there are several rules to become a \u201cfamous emo rapper.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s a hard way to even TRY to be like of one those other artists (if that\u2019s what Wikipedia said). To be an emo rapper, you have to first, be a rapper. Rap is an art. A valuable one. I think it even deserves to be totally isolated from music, because rap is something immense and fantastic. It takes a lot of skill to be a rapper. To even dare to be a rapper, you first have to listen to big, great masters of Hip Hop. \u201cBut Rooy, I already listen to my Lil Peep and my XXXTENTACION. I don\u2019t need to listen to other garbage.\u201d Lemme tell you that, those two artists, were definitely inspired by these great musicians I\u2019m going to name below. (Well, Lil Peep is definitely subjective; I know for a fact \u201cX\u201d did listen to them). Eminem.Jay-Z.Tupac (or 2pac)The Notorious B.I.G.Snoop Dogg.Dr. Dre.Kanye West\u2026 HAHA. Maybe\u2026Lil Wayne.And, I could keep on continuing with the list, but I have to accept that hip hop is NOT my favorite genre of music, so I\u2019m not sure who else I have to name here. Once you listened to these artists, analyze their styles. See what are they doing, and try to imitate them to create your own craft of rap. This is something you want to do, because you don\u2019t want to mumble like one of those crappy Soundcloud rappers. After you finished making your own identity, learn to put your words together with rhythm, rhyme, patterns, etc. For this, you might want to look at the lyrics of some good rap songs I cannot give to you. Do your research. Study poetry and literature, and build a great vocabulary with this. Personally, what a lot of mainstream rappers do now-a-days, is just repeating the same thing over and over again. For example, Gucci Gang by the memest of them all, Lil Pump. Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gangGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!) Spend ten racks on a new chainMy bitch love do cocaine, oohI fuck a bitch, I forgot her nameI can't buy a bitch no wedding ringRather go and buy Balmains Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gangGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)  God, bless this sad human being. A great lyricist and rapper I SURE can recommend to you, is nobody else than Ms. Lauryn Hill.  These are the lyrics of a sweet song by her called Doo Wop (That Thing), from one of the greatest albums of all the times, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friendThe one you let hit it and never called you again'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trimTo begin, how you think you're really gon' pretendLike you wasn't down and you called him again?Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' himIf you did it then, then you'd probably fuck againTalking out your neck, sayin' you're a ChristianA Muslim, sleeping with the ginNow that was the sin that did Jezebel inWho you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?Showing off your ass cause you're thinkin' it's a trendGirlfriend, let me break it down for you againYou know I only say it cause I'm truly genuineDon't be a hard rock when you really are a gemBaby girl, respect is just a minimumNiggas fucked up and you still defending 'emNow, Lauryn is only humanDon't think I haven't been through the same predicamentLet it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, PennIt's silly when girls sell their souls because it's inLook at where you be in, hair weaves like EuropeansFake nails done by KoreansCome again, come again, come again, come again. See the difference? Yes, it\u2019s amazing. To be a good, decent rapper, PRACTICE. Practice makes the master. Practice everyday, every night, but practice. This is just the secret. Pure practice. P R A C T I C E. \u201cBut Rooy, I already practiced. Hell, I know everything you just told me. I can be a rapper, and I want to be an emo rapper!\u201d Okay then, let\u2019s begin with the \u201cemo rapper\u201d steps. Yeah, steps. Create a Soundcloud account: It\u2019s an essential, my human.Make yourself a name: Once you\u2019re done with the Soundcloud account, try to name yourself something unoriginal. Hm, no. Well, something original. That depends on you, because in these days, \u201crappers\u201d are just making their names start with a Lil. Lil Lasagna, Lil Cucumber, Lil Guitar, Lil Poop\u2026 I swear, I know there\u2019s a Lil Dick out there.Dye your hair and ruin it forever: Just like you read it. To be an emo rapper, you sure do need a haircut. How about dying your hair on rainbow colors? Wait, no. That garbage dude called 6ix9ine is already doing it, lol.Buy a keyboard and do your thing: Start making mixes, things, and create your own music\u2026Do something illegal, call the attention, and become popular within months\u2026Sorry it had to end like that. I\u2019m just disappointed that someone wants to do that with their lives. But you know what, person that questioned this\u2026 you do you. And if you ever accomplish this, so that you know, there are better alternatives. My society, my school\u2026 all of it is covered by this subgenre that doesn\u2019t really do anything pleasurable. It\u2019s just, sad! Like, XXXTENTACION album, SAD! I hoped this may have helped. Good luck on your life, whoever you are, and remember\u2026 be always yourself, no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I am not a musical artist myself, I am surrounded by many people who are. Here are some things that I would suggest as you contemplate starting your music career: It is important to know what inspires you. First, I would list every single musical artist that you grew up listening to (like HEAVY rotation) and people that you currently listen to. What is it about their music that compels you? You don\u2019t need to go into a super detailed, profound description of what you find interesting about their music. It can be the context of their songs, the content of their lyrics, their beat/production selection, how they inflect their voice in a studio recording, how their voice sounds during a live performance, how they themselves perform live, etc. Next, it is good to recognize and acknowledge your own life\u2019s story. What have gone through in life, who are the people who grew up with, who are the people you currently surround yourself with, what do you currently do for a living, etc.? Doing this will help to personalize your own music and make it unique to you. You do not need to dye your hair, get face tattoos, do dumb things for clout. I wouldn\u2019t even consider Lil Pump to be an emo rapper. I do consider people like Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Juice WRLD to be emo rappers for their musical content. They do an amazing job at expressing their emotions through their music without being overly gimmicky (like Lil Pump).Find a recording studio. You can\u2019t be a rapper if you don\u2019t have a studio to record in. Whether it be at a friend\u2019s home or a professional studio. Be prepared to spend money on studio time, mixing and mastering, and producing. If you want to learn how to do everything at home, you can start by downloading the right software and you can begin by making your own beats on there. There are several tutorials on YouTube that are extremely helpful. If you want to build your own studio, be sure to budget money for the right equipment. Quality equipment means more money so save, save, save.Build a network. You can begin by building a brand for yourself on Social Media. Have you thought of what your stage name is going to be? Make it your name on everything. Start reaching out to people and communicating with them over the internet. The easiest and most accessible way I can think of doing this is creating an account on the hip-hop forum http://KanyeToThe.com A great example of how relationships can be made on this website is Texas-based group BROCKHAMPTON, who did all meet on KTT. Most importantly, you will need a Soundcloud account. Because of how easily accessible this social media platform is, any song that you post has the potential to speak like a wildfire. The best example of an occurrence such as this (that I can think of off the top of my head) was back in 2015 when Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti release his breakout song \u201cBroke Boi,\u201d which catapulted him into fame almost instantly. I am not saying this happens often, but since it happened to Carti, any song you post has that potential. Also, who in your town or metro area also raps and makes music? Who produces? Who throws events? Who does photography and videography? Who is a graphic designer? Interacting with your locals can also help you get a buzz because if you collaborate with anyone on any project they are likely going to post on their own accounts. This means their followers are going to start recognizing your name.Remember, music is an art and you have to do it for the right reasons. You don\u2019t want to look back in 10 or so years and think about anything stupid or shallow you\u2019ve done to gain clout. Any musical artist has the potential to be remembered and well-respected. It\u2019s all about your intentions and the way you go about things. I understand wanting fame, but your music is what matters the most. The fame will come along eventually if you work hard enough.
