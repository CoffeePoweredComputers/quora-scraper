            "answer_text": "There are plenty! There have been tons of famous female rappers over the years. Salt-N-PeppaLil KimNicki MinajCardi BEster DeanIggy AzaleaMissy Elliott (personally I think Lose Control would be great for performing)Many more, but not off the top of my head\u2026Not including any song by them, several songs you could get away with are Several Bone Thugs N Harmony songs. Tha Crossroads, For the Love of $, If I could Teach the World. All good examples, but they\u2019re really fast rappersA really good one is ignition by R Kelly (the remix). Good pacing, fun words, and all around enjoyable.Trey Songz. He\u2019s more RnB, but songs like Bottoms Up and Neighbors Know my Name are fun, if not a little inappropriate.Kid Cudi, either Day n Nite or Pursuit of HappinessNelly, songs like Dilemma would be goodBow Wow, Shortie Like MineBut a girl could rap any rap song she wanted. Rap is about expression, so pick any song that you feel represents you. If you\u2019re a tough person that takes nothing from no one, Ice Cube is your guy. Emotional? J Cole. Powerful? Kanye West. Just a homie from the ghetto? I would go with T.I, but that\u2019s biased because he\u2019s my favourite rapper. In the end, you\u2019re better off rapping something you believe in more than someone you sound like. ",
