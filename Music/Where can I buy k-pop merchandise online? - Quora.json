            "answer_text": "I ordered my first album with Amazon. Do check that the seller is the official company and not a resaler if you want to be safe. Nowadays I order albums through YesAsia. The products are all authentic and you get free shipping with orders over $50. Prices are decent, but he shipping can be really slow sometimes. Mwave\u2019s official Kpop goods store sells Meet & Greet albums at a super cheap price for what they are worth. These albums are hand signed by the artists themselves. Mwave is arguably the only 100% reliable source for signed albums besides attending fansigns. I got my signed Got7 album for about $33 with shipping and handling. The album itself was $24, which was sold at basically the original price. Many people have recommend Kpopmart to me, but I am hesitant to buy goods from them. Unlike Mwave, which only sells real signed albums, Kpopmart has been exposed for selling fake autographs multiple times. The other products on the site are all authentic from what I have heard. They have the best prices and shipping is generally fast. However, I don\u2019t believe in supporting a website that has sold fakes, so do take that into consideration. Have fun with album shopping! P.S. I just finished writing this answer and realized that OP was asking about merch, not specifically albums. Haha rip, at least you\u2019ll always have a reference for just buying albums! ",

An\u00fancios do vendedor  SM Global Shop My Super M album took a while to arrive, because I live in Brazil and there was a lot of order, so they left the international fans to receive almost a month later. EXO's album hasn't arrived yet. But the site is very reliable and the product arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Kpop | Wish The site is very good and has many good priced KPOP products and they deliver even ahead of time sometimes. Never had problems with the site. My Kai T-shirt hasn't arrived yet, because I bought it recently. Worth checking out.  *Just be aware that as this is a Chinese site, shirt sizes are measured in L, XL, XXL ... so, it can vary for both men and women.*  ",
