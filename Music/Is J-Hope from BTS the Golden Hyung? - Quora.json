            "answer_text": "Indeed. This man is a Kpop triple threat. . . no, wait - scratch that. He\u2019s a QUADRUPLE threat. Dance - He is BTS\u2019s main dancer and he started out dancing as well, so it only makes sense that he\u2019s good at this. Years and years of practice and training has led him to be one of the best dancers in Kpop. The power, the precision, the flow, the attention to detail, the emotions, JUST WOW. I didn\u2019t even know it was possible for humans to move like that. Girl or boy group dance this man is too good. Please observe below: Ice Cream Cake (Cover)  Boy Meets Evil  What he does with his ankles just looks like it hurts a lot. . .   \u2026. Rap - He is part of BTS\u2019s rap line, so obviously he can rap. I\u2019m really impressed because he didn\u2019t start out interested in rap, but with RM and Suga\u2019s help, J-Hope really knows how to spit fire - WITH A PASSION. He might not be the fastest, but he has really good flow. His song, Airplane was good example of this. However, my favorite was his part at the end of Outro: Tear (starts at 4:07). Here is a fancam of the live performance because the studio version didn\u2019t do the song justice. I apologize for the bad quality, but I WAS BLOWN AWAY when I watched it the \u201cLYS in Seoul\u201d film.  Vocals - Despite being a rapper, J-Hope\u2019s vocals are also really good. I find this rare for K-Pop rappers. J-Hope has a nice, low, smooth, soothing sound. The only thing is that he can\u2019t cover a wide range of notes like the BTS vocalists. He\u2019s very stable though. Even my mom thought he was the lead vocalist after Jungkook hahaha. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t get to sing that much because, well, that\u2019s not his role. Please do appreciate the short moments when he does sing: I Need a Girl (cover)  \u2026 Make It Right  \u2026. Spring Day  \u2026 I don\u2019t know if this counts as singing, but here: I Like It  \u2026. Producing - I\u2019m getting too lazy to explain, so this one will be brief. Just know that he contributes much of the song-writing and producing in BTS, and he does it well. Some examples in which he was listed as the first of the members as a producer (i.e. aside from the main producers at BH like Adora and Supreme Boi) include: Mic Drop - RM said in a V-Live that J-Hope saved Mic Drop . . . sooooo . . . yeah.  and Dionysus  \u2026\u2026 He also made his own mixtape Hope World, in which all songs, I thought, were GOOD. Please note, this is coming from a un-biased view . . . as much as I hate to admit it, I didn\u2019t really like J-Hope of BTS at first until I heard this mixtape.  \u2026.. EDIT: THERE\u2019S ONE MORE THING THAT J-HOPE CAN DO. Roshni Ramesh kindly pointed out that J-Hope is also a master beatboxer. Please observe below:  Is there something this guy CAN\u2019T do????!!! \u2026.. In summary, yes - Hobi is the golden hyung. Not a quadruple threat, but a QUINTUPLE threat at that, which is a rarity in Kpop. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he is. He's a very talented rapper. I always look forward to his rap in every song, it's very unique sounding and nice to listen to. He has a great flow and is definitely the hype man when it comes to them performing. Let's not forget what a huge success his mixtape was.Hobi is a great dancer. The Boy Meets Evil cheoreo he pulled was pure art.He can sing. Listen to 'Spring Day' comeback stage and you will know what I am talking about. He is truly the jack of all trades like Jungkook. I wish he had more opportunities to sing. If they can let Jungkook rap sometimes, they should definitely let Hobi sing tooHe's a mood maker. That's why he's called 'sunshine'. He's also a good bridge between the Hyungs and Dongsangs, sure they all get along as BTS but he's the connection between the Hyungs line and Maknae line sometimes.He does good acting. If you have seen the Run BTS episodes, you must have noticed that Jhope does good acting and is actually very committed to learning lines and delivering a good performance.",
