            "answer_text": "It depends where you stand as a pianist, and musician. Also the word \u201cperfectly\u201d is subjective. Do you mean play it all the way through without a mistake? The answer will most likely be never. Even the best pianists have a mistake or two when performing this piece. Here are some steps: First, read the music. If you can\u2019t really read the music just sitting there, then give yourself some years. Seriously. Also, listen to it a lot to begin memorizing the piece Aurally. Second, practice it between 30\u201360 minutes a day. I wouldn\u2019t practice this piece past that time frame. Its a piece to help your technique, and to show off your technique. However, if you overdo it you risk giving yourself some good old tendonitis. Steak is good when its tender, but not our tendons ;) Third, practice the parts that are the most difficult. For me I would need to work on the turns with the octaves first. That would most likely be my weakest section in the piece. The ending however would be something easier for me because I have learned Liszt Concerto 2. Recognize your strengths, and focus on your weaknesses. Depending on where you stand will help shed some light on the answer to this question. If you could provide me more information on your skill then I can give you a clearer answer. ",
