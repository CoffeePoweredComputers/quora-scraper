            "answer_text": "I'm sure that you've looked at the anatomy of the head by now. The epiglottis is a traffic cop muscle that tries to direct the food down the esophagus and the air up and down the trachea where the vocal cards are. There is always some small amount leakage. In theory, one could say that the swallowing muscles only affect the esophagus, but that's not true in practice. It's all connected. What makes throat relaxation (as well as high versus low notes) confusing is that it feels wrong for most people. It's feels counter-intuitive. You have to train your brain to accept what it usually thinks of as \"wrong\" to be OK. This tensing of the throat muscles happens because the areas of control for those several areas in your brain are so close together. It's like learning to move one finger without moving the one next to it. It takes time and practice. Most people are very impatient. It took me two years. There are many good methods for learning this. They will all get you to the same place. Some are just faster at it because we all start from a slightly different place. I studied the Seth Riggs method - Singing With the Stars. I did work for Michael Jackson and Michael used to take Seth on the road with him. Rather than try to paraphrase Seth's work, it's more important for me to talk about what worked for me. At first it felt totally wrong and I couldn't do it. Like I said, it took me a couple of years to get it right. Some years later, I was lecturing, not singing, in a large, and sometimes noisy, auditorium for few months. I was getting hoarse. Then I remembered my singing techniques. After two months, I had more vocal power, even in my singing than ever before. and it felt right. Be patient. Your re-education of the brain starts to happen slowly and then it keeps getting better and better. I had extended my upper range by more than an octave, got rid of the falsetto cross-over sound, added power and had much more endurance. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm \u201canswering\u201d this by saying that this specific question is best answered by a speech therapist and/or speech pathologist who is also an experienced voice teacher. That said, swallowing is actually one of the most complex physical acts an organism does and requires an amazingly coordinated dance of muscles, bones, cartilage and connective tissue to accomplish this. It's up there with the sneeze, the yawn and the funny thing dogs do when the shake off water (gotta love them doggies!). As others have noted, there is a lot of glottal, epiglottal, and subglottal activity involved in swallowing, while phonating involved primarily the thyro aryetnoid muscles and their supporting structure. Everything subglottal has to do with air supply and air pressure (like the bellows of an organ), while everything supra glottal has to do with the acoustics of modifying the sound of the core phonation. Indeed, studies have shown that human vocal folds phonating without the modifiers sounds a lot like a goat bleating! The thing is: swallowing uses much of the same system but in reverse but does not use the vocal folds because that leads to the lungs and we all know what happens when we drink liquid that goes down the \u201cwrong pipe\u201d! This is partially why you can't eat and sing at the same time - and why we can choke on food or drown on a teaspoon of water. This is the biological price we pay for having this amazing communication system called the vocal folds. Always a price to pay somewhere for a hereditary advantage! I hope this adds a bit to the discussion. Still, it would be great for a real speech pathologist to weigh in with a bit more technical accuracy! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to tell what muscles you mean by \u201cswallowing muscles\u201d and if we are talking about the same thing. If it\u2019s the digastric, that is small. Usually you don\u2019t need to think about some specific muscle when you sing because it\u2019s close to impossible to control them separately (it\u2019s like the caterpillar thinking about his thousand legs and unable to walk). You learn the coordination by getting right sensations under guidance of a teacher. The usual analogy to relax the throat and avoid grabbing with wrong muscles is thinking of yawning. Or you can try to consciously widen your throat. The big muscle you feel under your chin is your tongue, more precisely the root of the tongue (it is much bigger than you would think). It should remain quite soft (not stiff/hard) but you may naturally feel some movement because you use your tongue to articulate. In general it\u2019s better to learn these things with a teacher who sees what you do and can explain it to you in terms that you understand and instruct what and how to do in practice. There is a risk of misunderstanding when you read anatomic stuff from some random websites (which may have misinformation) and don\u2019t know your instrument very well (where those parts are and how they feel, if they can be controlled at all). Same information does not apply to all singing styles, because there are differences in the techniques. Just focus on feeling free and not strained in your throat area and that\u2019s a good start.
