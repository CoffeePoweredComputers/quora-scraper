            "answer_text": "This is a really tough question, but I will attempt to answer it fairly. To do so, I will pick mid-level, popular models from each company to compare. Let\u2019s pick the Fender American Standard Stratocaster (the model will soon change) and the Gibson Les Paul Studio. AMERICAN STANDARD STRAT  LES PAUL STUDIO  Value. Where I live, it is possible to buy a gently used American Standard Strat for about $650\u2013750 and a Les Paul Studio of similar condition for $850\u2013950. Both guitars are suitable for a range of musical styles and not particularly expensive to maintain. The Les is legitimately more expensive, as its components and construction are more expensive than that of the Strat, but the Strat\u2019s design is incredibly well-tested. Edge Fender.Playability. Strats are incredibly customizable. Necks are largely interchangeable, so players can find guitars that feel perfect for their individual geometries. In addition, Strats are a bit lighter and feel much lighter than Les Pauls. However, the Les has a more standard scale length (24 3/4\u2033) as compared to the Strat\u2019s 25 1/2\u2033, so, using the same strings, bending and fretting feel a little bit easier on the Les. In addition, the Les has a really nice neck to body balance. Even.Ease of setup. The Les has very few adjustments to make, since it is a set-neck instrument with an easily maintained bridge. There are only two pickups with 3 sounds. In contrast, the Strat has a bolt-on neck and a much more complicated bridge due to the tremolo (it is really a vibrato, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion). The Strat also has 3 pickups, usually with individually adjustable poles. Lastly, people are much more likely to do stupid things to Strats than they are to Les Pauls. Edge Gibson.Manufacturing. In the past few years, Gibson has gone through some major changes. They closed their factory in Memphis, but that factory only made semi and fully hollow models. The Nashville factory, where Les Pauls were previously made, remains open. For a couple of years, Gibson had a reputation for poor setups and bad finishes. I\u2019m not sure that was fair, and I hope it has been repaired. Fender has their act together. The quality of Fender guitars manufactured either in California or Mexico is consistently excellent. Fender Japan has consistently been superb, but now Japanese Fenders are not made for the US market, except for some uncommon models. Even Chinese-made Strats (and Telecasters) have gotten quite good. The main reason is that bolt-on solid-body guitars are not that hard to make. So at present, I would expect the American Standard Strat to be the more consistently solid instrument. Edge Fender.Sound. This is just personal. I like the sound of single coil pickups, like in the Strat, and I like the sound of humbuckers, like in the Les. Although enthusiasts like to change out pickups in Strats as almost a rite of passage for each new instrument, most Strat pickups sound more alike than different. In contrast, humbuckers vary greatly. I favor the style used in early models (the PAF) pickup, but high-gain models are very popular as well, especially with the high-gain crowd (largely, but not exclusively heavy metal players). Even.In summary, both are great guitars. Since the question is who makes the better guitars, any answer that picks one over the other will be wrong. However, I think that a Fender purchase is a little bit more likely to provide a great bang-for-buck instrument, whereas a Gibson is a bit more of a luxury instrument. Although I view myself as a Telecaster player more than anything, if I were to be asked to live with one guitar - a Strat or a Les - I\u2019d probably keep the Les and make sure to keep my back in shape.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a bit vague, because there are a significant assortment of different Gibson models and Fender models. If you look at all models for both companies as a whole, then the answer to the question would be that neither is better: they are just both different. However; when you take the most popular and most well known Gibson guitar, the Les Paul\u2026 then that becomes quite a different answer. I know I am not going to make myself popular towards the Les Paul fans with this answer, but Fender is definitely the winner when you purely look at construction and design quality. :) I cannot even begin to tell the number of times I had friends over or heard stories from guitar players I know, who arrived at the airport, only to find that the headstock of their Les Paul had broken off during travel. I know I\u2019m gonna get flak from the Les Paul lovers, but it is what it is: the Les Paul headstock design is generally considered a lesser than optimal design, creating a weak point in the neck. I never ever heard Strat or Tele people having to deal with a broken off head stock. Moreover: the Les Paul also feels a bit like you\u2019re holding a plank on a strap. Most Les Paul\u2019s I\u2019ve seen or played have no body contour, feel bulky, heavy, only 3 pick up selections, \u2026 Does that make Fenders better guitars than Gibsons? Well, definitely better designed than the Les Paul, for sure. However: Gibson is more than the Les Paul. There\u2019s many other great, iconic Gibson guitars.if you don\u2019t travel with your Les Paul all that much, or you always carry it as hand luggage so your headstock can\u2019t break off, and you like the bigger, fuller Les Paul sound, and you don\u2019t mind it\u2019s bulky heaviness, THEN\u2026 for you Les Paul is the best guitar!",
