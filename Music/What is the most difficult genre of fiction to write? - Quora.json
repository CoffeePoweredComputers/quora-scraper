            "answer_text": "Anything that requires the author to do extensive research on/have prior knowledge on. Very specific sub-genres of fiction (mainly) are hard to write. The easiest genre to write is romance because it has been overdone for centuries. In addition to that, romance has a much wider target audience than any other genre of fiction. Literally anybody of any age can read a romance novel; notwithstanding adult contemporary romances, of course. Want to sell more books? Well, all you have to do is write a compelling romance, and BAM!\u2026with great editing, you should get your foot into the door. However, if you want to write something more specific with a target audience of only a few selective people (\u2018few\u2019 would be defined as 30\u201375% of the population as supposed to 80\u201390% of the population\u2014just using random statistics here), you are going to have to do more than exercise just a little bit of your creativity to write a novel. You are going to have to come up with something that is almost insanely original in order for it to stand out from the rest of the books in more popular genres. Plus, it is going to require more than just fine editing skills to cater your novel to the general public. You need a good publicist too. Therefore, the following genres of fiction are generally harder to write: Historical fiction- if you are planning on writing a novel about Joan of Arc, for example, yet you know nothing about her, you are going to have to do a lot of research prior to planning out ideas for the novel. The sources you use must come from credible places. You might even have to travel to a completely different country just to examine historical monuments/landmarks or visit public museums/libraries to obtain more information about your person or historical place of interest. Some writers even go so far as to interview the experts (such as historians and archeologists) to acquire an in depth analysis of the person or place of interest. Actually, it is almost a requirement for any good writer to interview the experts prior to jotting down their ideas for the novel. This requires a lot of time, patience, and money on their part, yet they get such little reward for all the effort they put into writing novels of this genre.Fantasy- Fantasy is a genre of its own. Fantasy is difficult to write because it requires a lot of creativity to come up with fictional creatures in often times dystopian/utopian societies. Writers of this genre usually have above-average intelligence (IQs ranging between 120\u2013130 and above) and most of them are intuitive introverts. Intuitive introverts tend to have higher IQs than the rest of the population.Suspense- it requires a lot of masterminding and prior planning to come up with a good storyline for suspense novels. The use of foreshadowing is an essential component of writing a good suspense novel. Unfortunately, not everyone is good at using symbolism, metaphors, or foreshadowing.Science fiction- Another genre that requires extensive research and prior planning if you know nothing about how labs work or how doctors/surgeons/scientists perform work in their job-related settings. Depending on the type of science fiction you are writing, you might also have to know a little bit about historical time periods/famous public figures of said time periods, plus a little about chemistry too (if you are planning to write a novel about large amorphous blobs resembling viscous jellyfish-like-man-killing creatures, for example).Horror- This is not difficult to write, per se, but it does require some craftiness and tact to put pen to paper to describe in great detail the antagonist(s)\u2019and protagonist(s)\u2019 role(s) in the story. The trick is in the details. Anyone can write about a villain or an evil archetype, but not everyone can include just enough gore to excite the reader with just a *tad bit of romance to help distract the reader from the plotline/the rising conflict between the villain(s) and the heroes/the protagonist(s). What a lot of novices get wrong about this genre is that they do not have a good background/good plotline to support the story. This is the reason why you see so many poorly written overly-gory often rushed resolutions to what could have been excellent horror movies, had the writers taken more time to develop the expositions and the themes of these stories.Psychological thrillers- Writing a good psychological thriller requires a working knowledge of how the mind works. For a writer to succeed in this genre of fiction; he or she must have: emotional, intrapersonal, and interpersonal intelligence\u2014something that most people lack. Emotional intelligence takes a long time to develop. Some people even take years to develop an average EQ. Writing a psychological thriller is not for everyone.",

            "answer_text": "The most difficult genre of fiction to write is whichever one requires the author to create the most. Compelling stories can be told everywhere from Eragon to Bloor Street. That part\u2019s taken care of as long as the author has a good idea, is really into it and is serious about pursuing it. Creating setting details is a virtually endless grind. Pull up a map of your home city. Now rename every single street, in such a way that the names all make sense together. Are they all in the same language? If so, what are the rules of the language? If they\u2019re in an existing language (let\u2019s say English), what naming conventions are used? For example, virtually every Canadian city or town has a King Street and a Queen Street, but good luck finding those street names in the US. Worse yet, there\u2019s no set time when those details are obviously complete. The author has to eventually make a snap judgment and actually write the book. Hypothetically, an author could spend a D&D-style cellared-in long weekend doing nothing but naming streets, but then who\u2019d want to read that book? When an author screws up a detail, like my post here last year about placing a toaster in the year 1890 (it was invented in 1893), it can be fatal to the reader\u2019s interest in the book. The last thing I, as a reader, want is to have to spend 15 minutes reading something other than the novel because I need to verify a factual assertion. For example, in a fantasy novel I\u2019m editing, dragons drink milk at one point. I spent the next 10\u201315 minutes not reading the book, but instead attempting to find accounts of zookeepers feeding dairy products to snakes. When you\u2019re using pre-set settings and characters, you can lean on the real world. When you\u2019re writing a more research-based project, you need to be innovative and inventive. Making stuff up is research too, as long as you\u2019re constantly referring to your internal notes. Science fiction and fantasy are more prone to forced inventiveness, although it can happen in any genre. ",
