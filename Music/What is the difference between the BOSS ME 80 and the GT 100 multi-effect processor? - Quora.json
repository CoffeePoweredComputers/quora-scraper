            "answer_text": "Biggest thing you see right away is that the ME 80 has knobs for real time adjustment of the simulated pedals.The GT 100 is more menu driven. Way more.The GT will be more flexible than the ME provided you preprogram that flexibility to do what you want it to do . Like re-route the effects to a different order or do some morphing thing with the pedal. I don't think you can juggle the stuff around the same way in the ME.I think it is also sort of the GT has x% better sounding stuff, but who knows ?The ME 80 has lots of tricks up its sleeve. If I was buying : Used GT 8 ",

Too many bells and whistles and tweaking them down to two or three presets that you might actually use is an enormous hassle.  I've recently been using a Fender Mustang II amp that has very nice built in effects but, after several hours of experimenting and tweaking, I have exactly one preset that doesn't suck and making real-time adjustments is virtually impossible.
