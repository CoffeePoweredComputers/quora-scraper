            "answer_text": "Okay, here we go, Jennie definitely might release a couple of songs here and there but I think her main focus would be being an influencer. She might also join YG\u2019s producing team as she wrote the lyrics of a few of their songs. She most probably might stay at YG now that CEO has changed and she has gotten a lot of opportunities by her skills, talent and YG. Lisa might go back to Thailand and do most of her activities there. She might continue her job as a mentor, produce and release tracks and dance videos. She might have a lot more freedom if she leaves YG because the first four years in Blackpink wasn't pleasant for her. I think Lisa has that thing about her that makes her different in everything she does. Ros\u00e8 might go as a solo singer and will receive more attention. Se seems very passionate about music and we might even see her natural voice as some blinks might say. Jisoo is the only one I think won't be releasing music soon. She auditioned YG as an actress and might continue to do so. She also just got her first role so I see her as an actress. I also think she might release a track here and there. In the end, all four of them would really succeed in anything they do and be happy. stan everbody ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly (I think) in either 2022 or 2023 their contract will end. The Blackpink members will then have to decide if they want to resign with YG entertainment. What I think will happen: Ros\u00e9: not resign her contract with YG and instead sign with another company. Jisoo: It depends. YG did get her a good role for an upcoming drama. I think that if it is successful and YG continues to promote her as an actress and they get her roles, then perhaps she might stay with YG entertainment. If not, I think she\u2019ll leave YG. Jennie: Her whole brand is tied to YG entertainment. But Jennie has gone threw a LOT of things these past couple of years. She might decide (I think) to not resign with YG and take a year off from the entrainment world or more. Lisa: Lisa I think might be the most trapped. YG has built her brand whether anyone likes it or not. She might be in the same circumstance that G-Dragon was in, he had no choice but re-sign with YG because they own his brand. So she has (I think) a high chance of re-signing with YG entertainment.  ",
