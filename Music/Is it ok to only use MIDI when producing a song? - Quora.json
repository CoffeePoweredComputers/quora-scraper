            "answer_text": "Is it OK to only use MIDI when producing a song? I wouldn't say that is OK\u2026 because that is literally impossible. MIDI is a digital protocol used for controlling various things, usually music related hard- and software. It does not produce sound by itself. I'm gonna assume you actually want to know if it is OK to make music completely \u201cin the box\" using just software and no outboard gear. Which, sure that is OK. Make music however you want and/or can. Why wouldn't that be OK? And why would you ever even care about the opinion of someone saying that that isn't OK? ",

            "answer_text": "There are many music producers who produce music with only midi. When you watch a movie with orchestral music for instance, you might think that you are listening to an orchestra. The chances are you are listening to midi orchestrations. Many midi composers earn a living working for television and motion pictures. They use software from Spitfire Audio, Eastwest Studios, and a dozen others who provide samples of strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion that respond to midi commands. Electronic music is sometimes done with hardware synths, but midi synths are more prevalent. I have produced a large library of music which is 95 percent midi, but I play a number of non midi instruments. With my knowledge of instruments, I can emulate thousands of instruments with midi that sound like the real thing. There are a large number of musicians who are vastly more skilled than I who produce with midi professionally. Listen to Snarky Puppy or Stevie Wonder who are masters of midi. ",
