            "answer_text": "I found one question similar to yours and I have answered it here: Betsy Wong's answer to What do you think about Lee Hi's Comeback (No One) featuring BI? I totally love her comeback. Her more mature side is shown through this and you could tell that she's grown up already. I would rate this a 7 out of 10 for both the song and MV. This is how I interpreted the meaning of the lyrics: It's about a lonely person who longs for love and care from someone and wants to be in a relationship with that special person. He/she also wonders, is there anyone lonely out there who would want his/her love. And the person is already at his/her limit. Anyone there? Is there anyone to hold onto me? Even as I look around I can\u2019t find anyone Where are you? Is there anyone who\u2019ll take me? I can\u2019t stand this anymore Please come to me [Pre-Chorus: LEE HI] The same path under the same moonlit sky We\u2019ll probably end up falling asleep at the same place Now I want to be with someone I want to get rid of this loneliness I don\u2019t wanna be alone anymore The same path under the same moonlit sky. We'll probably end up falling asleep at the same place. Now I want to be with someone. I want to get rid of this loneliness. I don't wanna be alone anymore! So he/she started to find the special one. That lonely person just want anyone, or someone like him/her, to rescue him/her from his/her loneliness. That person sounds desperate. Knock knock, anyone there? (Knock knock, I\u2019m here, knock knock right there) Anyone there? (Knock knock where are you?) Respond to me Anyone there? True he/she wants anyone to be his/her special someone but that person must be worthy enough. Lee Hi's part: I wait throughout this abnormally long night I treasure my heart and keep it safe under the covers As I continuously wait for you The night you arrive I will take it out and give it to you B.I's part: Anyone who can make me go crazy Anyone who can make me breathe Anyone who can make me excited If there is something wrong, you can correct me!
