            "answer_text": "The 10 second scene where jennie is rapping and wearing a outfit that resemble a physiatrist outfit  Some of the nurses at the hospital union in South Korea got offended and said that jennie was \u201csexualizing\u201d things which then they decided to demand an apology from yg and ask for that scene to be remove. On the other side of the world, blinks, other fandoms and other random people from all over came to defend blackpink by telling yg to not delete the scene.       Other blinks were mad and use other idols as an example for justice of this scene     \u201cWhy not punish all of the idols who did it, instead of come at only one person\u201d \u201cWhy are you guys now just complaining about this situation, when their were others\u201d \u201cThese nurses uses popularity as an excuse even though popular Kpop idols did the same thing\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not even a nurse outfit\u201d \u201cThese nurses are haters and bunch of jealous fools\u201d Koreans responses \ud83d\udc47      +532, -121] Isn't it usually the people who claim themselves to be feminism who are always viewing things in a weird, sexual manner? Why are they always accusing everything of being sexually degrading? Why do they view everything under such a lens when everyone else isn't thinking that? 2. [+208, -70] The music video scene is an expression of the lyrics saying that even a doctor wasn't able to fix the pain of being lovesick and that she had to overcome it herself. Jennie is playing the role of both doctor and patient and showing that she's a strong woman. \"I'm priceless, A prince not even on my list, Love is a drug that I quit. No doctor could help when I'm lovesick.\" Please don't fall for bait like this and support the type of woman that Black Pink is trying to express. 3. [+194, -77] All this fuss again with the outfits? Why is everything always being accused of being sexualized? 4. [+89, -30] Feminists claim to be feminists by day but they're obviously watching p*rn every night if they know that nurse outfits are sexualized, aigoo \u3161\u3161 5. [+91, -39] It was a short 3 second scene, it's weird that people are fixating on that and thinking up such weird things about it (if you read the lyrics, their intentions are completely different). I honestly feel like people are taking out their mental health problems on Black Pink;; 6. [+86, -40] Are the commenters here completely insane?;;; I get that you're trying to defend your favorite group but how can you claim that they're not sexualizing an entire profession by their outfit when they've shortened it and styled it in such a manner? Have you ever seen someone take a judge's robe and shorten it into a bodycon dress like this? No nurse in real life would wear such an over the top uniform. Don't you think nurses have a right to feel offended by their portrayal? How would you feel if a group as influential as Black Pink portrayed your profession in such a manner;; It's not just about the lyrics. 7. [+48, -4] This problem continues to be brought up time and time again because nurses continue to be negatively affected by their portrayal by celebrities. I think some people are treating this like it's not a big deal just because it doesn't affect them. 8. [+51, -15] I'm a man but I understand why the nurses would feel this way. They're already working such hard jobs, imagine having to deal with sexual harassment on top of that... I can see why they'd feel uncomfortable seeing their profession portrayed like this on TV. 9. [+40, -5] If nurses took offense to this, that's it, it's game over. Why do third party people think they have a right to an opinion on the subject? Just because \"that wasn't the intention\" doesn't mean that nurses don't face sexual harassment because of portrayals like this. 10. [+35, -2] All feminism issues aside, I find it disgusting that nurses continue to be portrayed in this manner 11. [+42, -8] I get that freedom of expression exists but from the perspective of the nurses, I can see why they get so pissed seeing this. They already get treated like slaves in the hospitals and then they have to deal with all the creepy ajusshis sexually harassing them because of this image that p*rn has put on them. Black Pink is no longer a rookie group, they should be old enough to step up and say that outfits like this are wrong.. tsk, pathetic. 12. [+31, -4] Nurses are out there suffering right now in masks and full body suits, it's thoughtless to portray them like this in skirts and high heels 13. [+29, -5] Nurses have every right to be mad 14. [+27, -3] Then why is it okay to have female and male groups dancing in school uniforms? 15. [+26, -4] Men don't understand what the issue is because they've never been victim of sexual harassment. Nurses in the hospitals are still facing sexual harassment every day at work today, and moreso than other professions because their uniforms have long been a subject of sexualization by the media. 16. [+23, -5] As a nurse suffering through the pandemic right now, this bothers me so much After this incident, yg deleted the scene but people all over the internet started to post the deleted scene everywhere and make fun of the nurses. Few days later, Jennie was shown with a swollen eye, which look like tears eyes Few days afterwards, Jennie decided to wear pants that label censored and people thought that was for the nurses who demanding for the scene to be deleted.  The nurses then congratulate the girls after the scene was taking down but people are still mad at the nurses and want the nurses to apologize because they didn\u2019t really target any other idols doing the same thing that same yr ",
