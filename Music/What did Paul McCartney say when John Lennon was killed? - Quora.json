            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t be too hard on Paul Mac Cartney. The news of Lennons death shocked everyone. You have to put your selves back in the times. The first we knew of it was that he was hurt. Then it was that we was shot but he may pull through. When the confirmation was confirmed (I believed it was during a football game with Howard Cosell-who had interivewed Lennon). But I remember alot of us saying \u201cthis can\u2019t be true\u201d its a hoax or someone has started a rumour. Even Lennins friends initally refused to believe it. Paul was recording with George Martin at the time who confirms that the man went into total shock and they spent the rest of the session just talking. TO be honest, Mac Cartney should never have been put in front of a microphone. That was the only gaff. He was in no state to comment. George was asleep when it happened and Ringo was holidaying and flew staight back. Paul (after watching this) I believe was on auto pilot. How many of us have heard a close loved one has died unexpectantly and thought \u201cIs this really true\u201d -It is like the Beatles when Brian Epstien died-the blood just drain away from their faces. Their friend had been ripped out of the picture. Look at the two pics of John standing in Stu Sutcliffes painting loft. One shows a man grief stricken. The second had George comforting him. A same look of disbelief. I would leave Paul alone on this one. He did his best but I believe the emotion was too much. The press should have respected him and left him to just make a statement like George. ",

            "answer_text": " Everybody knows Paul McCartney said, \u201cIt's a drag\" when suddenly confronted for comment by the press regarding the death of John Lennon. Obviously he was devastated and failed to find the right words to say, or rather failed to say what people expected and wanted him to say. However, Paul McCartney issued a statement later about John's death and here's what he wrote: \u201cHe was a great man and will be missed by the whole world, and he will be remembered for his art, music and contribution to world peace.\u201d Later still he added: \u201cThere's something about sudden death. There are so many things left unsaid. I would just liked to have seen John the day before and just straightened everything out with us. We found we could talk to each other as long as it was about kids and stuff like that.' And much later he told interviewers: 'I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was, \u201cJohn was really fond of you\". He was very jealous and so was I. The last telephone conversation I had with him, we were still the best of mates!\u201d (Excerpts from \u201cMcCartney - Songwriter\" by Howard Elson) ",
