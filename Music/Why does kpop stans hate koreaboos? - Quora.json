            "answer_text": "Koreaboos are often some very creepy people, and I think they cast the average stan, or anyone with a genuine interest in Korean culture, in a negative light. Joe Stan has his favorites, his biases. For whatever reason he appreciates the sound and esthetic of certain idols or the genre in general. K-pop may have introduced him indirectly to cuisine he\u2019s never tried, or to unfamiliar customs, and he enjoys these things as a mind broadening experience. By the same token Joe Culture has an appreciation for the subtleties in the Korean language and social structure, and tries hard to learn about them properly. His enjoyment in meeting and befriending real live Korean people is an extension of that appreciation, and his experience is also mind broadening. When Becky Koreaboo meets a real live Korean, that person is an object in her Korean collection. A Korean boyfriend is a BTS inflatable doll with a pulse. She will memorize a few phrases in Romanized Korean, not bothering to learn Hangul, and use it inappropriately while bragging that she\u2019s speaking Korean. She makes no effort to understand the culture and etiquette. Her mind is set on living in Korea and becoming an idol; or she will try to win an idol to her heart by showing up at the airport without pants. Obesessive fans make Joe Stan look like the stereotypical SF geek who won\u2019t keep a job and has his mother pay for his Comic-Con tickets. They invalidate Joe Culture\u2019s sincere attempts to learn about a complex new language and a different society. And the objectifying of a nation turns living people into collectibles to be kept on a shelf. ",

            "answer_text": "Koreaboos r obsessive. They also give kpop stans a bad rep. They\u2019re the type to write romanized korean everywhere like \u201cSARANGHAE OPPA\u201d. Or they comment this hoping their idol would notice them. Writing romanized korean doesn\u2019t do anything! Idols don\u2019t read korean in romanized letters, they read it in hangul!!! Obsessed with their \u201coppa\u201dFetishize koreans and/or east asiansThink they\u2019re going to date their idolSometimes try and look koreanThrows in random korean words while speaking (when they don\u2019t have an understanding on the language) \u201cOmg you\u2019re such a pabo (fool/idiot)\u201dProbably refers to others using korean honorifics such as hyung, oppa, unnie, noona, etc.Yes, kpop fans r extremely passionate about their idols, but koreaboos r straight up weirdly obsessive. I think any sane person would be weirded out by koreaboos. ",
