            "answer_text": "If it is, then everyone I know, including myself, are very big Sinners. Today has a theme in my life, Good Intentions are Good Deeds, Bad Intentions, are Bad Deeds. So what are your Intentions? In my lifetime, people paying for Software has been the hardest part. I paid out thousands to discover this Answer, because I felt it so important to know the Answer. I had a Telesales Person, was paid by myself, to Sell Health and Safety Games. The Owner would go out getting Meetings with Top Companies, and my Telesales Person, would demonstrate the Game Playing it over the Phone. This Telesales Person also got Appointments. I did this for years, with the Telesales getting \u00a312,000 per annum from me. He did this for over two years. I never produced one Invoice to this Company Owner, in all that time, because I thought our Performance was not good enough. I was warned before do this, NOT to do this Telesales, by a very good Salesman, who I personally got Appointment for, making thousands. It was Hotels, Web Sites, allowing the Customer to walk around the Hotel, by using very special software, on the Internet. 9/11 happened, and I was never paid over \u00a33,000, because Hotels knew they needed to lay off their staff. I took the lost. Sometimes Questions NEED Answers, if you find out something important, it just is needed. Therefore, the Music Business will change it\u2019s Business Model, after Apple screwed up the Music Market. This trust in change, has happened since the \u201dLuddite Uprising\u201d began in Nottingham in November 1811. I live in Nottinghamshire, so was taught this in School. We MUST embrace change, it takes a lot of faith though. I hope people will get money to Musicians, otherwise Music will disappear, but it is so intrinsic to our well-being. Musicians need to change too, and use their power to help up and coming Musicians. I am a Musician with a brand new Music Theory, so I\u2019m hoping a future is there, whatever Paths open up, we must follow. Please support the Change, and then you will be doing something with the future, in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the applicable regional, national, and international laws. Legality can be very different across the globe, and across eras and contexts. Here are some helpful pointers: All laws are conditional\u2014see if you meet the relevant conditions if you are concerned.Lots of free stuff is legal to access in places where not all free stuff is legal to access. This includes music.Copyright infringement is not theft or piracy. Sometimes laws treat uploading, downloading, and possessing in different ways when it comes to alleged copyright infringement.Legality is hardly a constructive or ethical guide to behavior\u2014your concerns, when making decisions about how to act, should be more substantially rooted.So, it could be that any downloading of free music is illegal in some places, but in most places free music is conditionally legal to download. Some methods of downloading are considered illegal in select times and places, for various reasons (not just copyright infringement), and cost is never the deciding factor. Indeed, paying for the same access can be just as illegal in most situations. Context matters. ",
