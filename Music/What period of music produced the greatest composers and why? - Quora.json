            "answer_text": "I agree wholeheartedly with Claire Callahan Goodman\u2019s answer that every period had it\u2019s shining lights. The further back in time we go, the less familiar we are, it seems. I once took a class on Gregorian chant and the teacher said it was a \u2018high water mark\u2019 of European culture. It took some getting used to, but yes, there was some amazing stuff there. Just to take another example, the period from 1580 to 1625 in England was called the Golden Age. This roughly corresponds to the time of Shakespeare. There was a flourishing of madrigal, lute song and masque entertainment. The lute was the preeminent instrument. John Dowland published the first lute song book in 1597 with parts laid out on two pages so four people could sit around a table and sing together. This spawned the publication of thirty-six similar collections over the next two decades, 567 songs with tablature. John and Robert Johnson, John Dowland, Francis Cutting, Daniel Batchelor, Philip Rosseter, Anthony Holborne, John Daniel, Thomas Campion, Robert Jones and many other virtuosi flourished in London. There were many on the continent too. Robert Dowland\u2019s _Varietie of Lute Lessons_ published in 1610 collected music from all over Europe that was the cream of the crop. Much of it is very difficult to play, which shows how high the standard of the day was. ",

            "answer_text": "The Classical era or period starting around 1750 to, for me 1850, which includes composers like Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Liszt\u2026Also active in this period were Rossini and Paganini. I recognize that the classical period actually ended before Beethoven died\u2026..because Beethoven was the one who ended it! Intellectually, this era was also labeled the Age of Enlightenment with philosophers like Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu writing of the value of the common person and the power of human reasoning in overcoming the problems of the world. The musical scene of this period also reflected the changes that were occurring in the society in the times which the music was being written. This period was the first time in the history of music where public concerts had became an important part of the musical scene. Even though music was still being composed for the church and for the court, with the advent of public concerts the new view reflected that music should be written for the enjoyment and entertainment of the common person. Hell, I don't know what was in the water then but I'd love to have has a sip or two. Other wise I don't know why such music was composed then but I'm thankful. ",
