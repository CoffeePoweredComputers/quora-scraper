            "answer_text": "No, Not Worth, Home Theatre Systems, what we are sold today are nothing more then poorly designed system, A Typical Home Theatre designed will include, an Amplifier or What Is Called as Audio Video Receiver, which can encode and decode your audio signal and re code them according to preference of your sound choice, Dolby, DTS Stereo, All Channel Sound, with 2.1, 5.1, 7.1, 7.2, 11.2 System which will have multi channel mean 2, 5 , 7 or 11 speakers with 1 or two sub woofers, Each Speaker will need to be matched with Impedence and Quality of Speaker wire, and connected to AV receiver, Rather then Buying Intex System you are better of Buying A Good Head Phones, I would recommend Onkyo or Yamaha Budget Systems, for your use if Budget is Limited, Or Go for Any good Sound Bars, From Bose to Samsung, Intex system destroys quality of Sound and Just Amplifies them into something where you can not identify different sounds, it destroys Music if you are music lover, ",

            "answer_text": "If you are looking for a mid range Home Theater, then you can surely buy Intex. It worth the money. I can understand the reason why you said \u201cIntex\u201d and the other people answering your question didn't get it. Do not buy it online. Go to a local dealer and get it from there. If you want a 2.1 speaker, keep a budget of 2.5\u20133k for a good product. If you are going for a 5.1, keep a budget of minimum 4.5\u20135k for that.. Or else you won't be happy with the sound. Because you can get a Intex 5.1 speaker within 3k as well but the sound quality will be minimum.. So choose accordingly. You can also look for other similar brands like Frontech, Punta, etc. iBall, F&D will cost you a bit more than these, but the sound quality is lovely. ",
