            "answer_text": "Firstly, September is god awful. School starts again. Case closed. Secondly, \u201cWake Me Up When September Ends\u201d is a song that was written by Billie Joe Armstrong when his father passed away when Billie Joe was 10. But the music video contains some different themes. It shows a couple. The boyfriend promises never to leave the girlfriend, and everything is great. Until he signs up for the military and is shot dead in the line of duty. Presumably during the US invasion of Iraq. I suppose you could say that the song is about the death, the futility of war, and loss. Mostly loss. ",

In my family, we all tend to get a little sad, cranky, snappish in October. We apologize to one another and say, \u201cI just feel Octoberish.\u201d There were scorched earth events that happened to my children and I in October about 20 years ago. The echo of those events is still here. ",
