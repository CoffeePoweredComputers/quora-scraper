            "answer_text": "I'm a big fan of the classics, so it's the traditional base 10 for me. When I run out of fingers, I use toes, so I'm good up to 110. I knew someone, though, that counted on his fingers in base 2. Folded down stood for zero, straightened out meant one. So he could count up to \u2026 just a minute \u2026 1+2+4+8+16+\u2026+2^9. (He didn't use his toes.) Correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, he'd practiced for years, since he'd been a child, so he was pretty good at it. When I'm counting large numbers of items, I usually count off by twos. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you want to count. What the purpose is for. Counting to a particular number. Counting a number of objects. Counting by ones or multiple of ones. Counting by factors. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\u2026 One, Two, Three, Four, Five,\u2026 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,\u2026 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,\u2026 Sometimes you might use your fingers and/or toes to help keep track of numbers while counting. A good way is to use a counting device where you just press a button for each count or a digital counter. Especially if you are counting large numbers, you don\u2019t have to think about it, it gives you the total count. Great if you need to count how many of x, y and z objects there are. This would probably be my best way. A Counting Device. ",
