            "answer_text": "Vandoren has been my top choice for clarinet reeds (and soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone sax) for \u2026. decades now, so I\u2019m pretty familiar with them, and have tried (at least once) virtually all of their clarinet and sax varieties. The V12 3.5+ is my clarinet reed of choice. However, I wasn\u2019t actually aware of the V21 (don\u2019t know how that got by me!). The reviews I\u2019ve seen have been very positive, so I\u2019m going to have to try them out for myself. Vandoren\u2019s description is:\u201cThe V21 reed combines the conical shape of a 56 rue lepic reed with a V.12 profile. This unique combination makes all registers of the clarinet more accessible with warmth and a depth of sound. It will allow you to play with amazing presence and immediate response.  V21 is the perfect reed for performances that require the ability to handle large interval leaps efficiently with an even and rich tone.\u201d I\u2019m intrigued by the line about handling \u201clarge interval leaps efficiently with an even and rich tone\u201d - that would be great! Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "For many years I used only V12 reeds (size 3.5) and enjoyed their warm, dark tone quality. Recently, however, I have played around with some V21 reeds as I performed more music in the upper registers. The V21\u2019s seem to adjust better to the third register, but sound brighter in the lower registers. I prefer the warmer sound of the V12\u2019s, but when playing Sousa marches and similar bright pieces I find myself drawn to the V21\u2019s. For context, I play on a Vandoren M13 mouthpiece with a Bay Silver ligature. ",
