            "answer_text": "Well - of the top of my head - WalMart and Amazon seem to be thriving, and they need people to stock the shelves and pack up stuff to be delivered, and even an artist can do that. Restaurants have increased their home delivery business, so they need people to deliver their orders, something else an artist should be able to do. And the fast food places still need people to flip the burgers and put the pizzas in the oven. An artist can do that. So, there is plenty of work out there. An artist can survive. Can\u2019t say what will happen to their art, however -that\u2019s probably going to suffer. But, hey, if we have to destroy the arts in order to combat the covid 19 pandemic, I guess that\u2019s what we have to do. Although I have a feeling that, after the arts get destroyed, the covid 19 pandemic will still be with us. ",
