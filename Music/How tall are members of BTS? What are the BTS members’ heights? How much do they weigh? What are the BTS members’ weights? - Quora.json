            "answer_text": "Update: I would like to add a few words on the rationale in my analysis of BTS members\u2019 heights, which I omitted in the original answer, and which I think are important messages of which fans or armies should be brought to awareness. Demystifying their height can actually, first of all, help us explain why sometime one is higher than another, and on other occasions, the gap is reversed. Getting straight about their height, however, has nothing to do with armies\u2019 (including myself) affection for these talented and lovely boys who are as passionate about art and music as they are about the meaning of life, which, I believe, is the drive behind their fame. Also, my interest is not so much in examining their height as in rendering explicit a culture of mystification about height in South Korea. More often than not, celebrities have no choice but to make up their profiles (height, weight etc.) to fit into the so-called \u201cnorm,\u201d and what lies behind these blatant \u201cpublic lies\u201d is people\u2019s expectation that they don\u2019t fall out of the norm. The celebrities\u2019 doing so also in turn reinforces the culture of peer-pressure in the wider public where people judge of each other in terms of height, weight and appearances. Let\u2019s \u2014fans\u2014do what we can do: appreciating the idols for the way they are, and not fostering a judgemental culture where celebrities are compelled to cater to the public taste. Then celebrities can feel more confidence in just being the way they are. After all, what matters is not their height, weight or even appearances, but the way they transform us by their wonderful music, dance and artistic performance. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The heights of BTS members in most answers here are extremely exaggerated. Most just take the official profiles as the standard, but profile d\u00e9tails are often fabricated\u2014let alone the profiles of Korean celebrities.  So instead of trusting unreliable data, let\u2019s look at this photo, which I\u2019m pretty sure tells everything you need to know about their height. The figure in the middle is Bae Yong-joon, a celebrity of older generations who may not be very well-known in the West. His OFFICIAL profile height is 180cm. I would leave the figure there and believe it to be true for two reasons: 1) older generations don\u2019t have many incentives to make up their profile data; 2) the real height of Bae can only be the same or shorter than 180cm, so taking 180cm as a given to measure BTS members can help us generate an estimation of their maximal heights. Now we can look at Jungkook and Jin standing close to Bae. Jungkook seems to be approximately 3cm shorter than Bae, but don\u2019t gloss over his shoes, which looks insanely strange with high heels boosting at least 5-7cm. Taking into account Bae\u2019s heel of 2cm, my estimation of Jungkook\u2019s height falls within 170\u2013172cm. Jin\u2019s heel seems to be fairly normal, so I\u2019d take him to be as tall as 176\u2013178cm, slightly shorter than his profile. RM slightly bended his body leaning towards Jungkook and his heel is fairly normal too. Still he looks only approximately 3\u20133.5cm shorter than Bae so I think his height is 178\u2013179cm. J-Hope only looks tiny little higher than Jimin, both significantly shorter than Bae. Taking into account their high heels\u2014which are not as dramatic as Jungkook\u2019s but still very high, I think Jimin\u2019s height seems to be 168\u2013171cm, and J-Hope is 170\u2013172vm. Finally we come to V and Suga. Suga is about 2cm shorter than Jin, but his heels must be much higher given the unusual knee position. If we take his heels to be higher than Jin\u2019s by 3\u20134cm, then his height should be 170\u2013173cm. V is at almost the same height as Bae, but his heels are much higher. So I estimate his height to be 175\u2013178cm. ",
