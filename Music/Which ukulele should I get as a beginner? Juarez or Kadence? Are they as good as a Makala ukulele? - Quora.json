            "answer_text": "Choosing your ukulele is a complicated one... Different people have different preferences, like my guitar for example, some don't like it and some say they love it. I don't rely on the popularity of a brand when choosing one for me... I don't get influenced by seeing a lot people using a specific brand. I really have to go to a music store and try them out... What matters most is your own preference, ukulele have different types.. Soprano, concert, tenor and baritone and ukulele players choose which type that they feel good playing with. Just go to a store and try them out. If you already know some chords, try playing it on the ukes you are testing. As you use different ukes you'll feel the differences of each brand then you'll have the feeling of wanting to take home one of it. You will want one considering the factors like the sound, the color, shape, how it feels in your hands and the price as well... What ever factor that is that made you like that brand is up to you because it is your uke you are buying.. If you have to try every uke hanging on the store to find the one that will satisfy you, do it. (I've done that, good thing the store have accommodating staffs) you might get surprised that there are some brands that you haven't heard of are better the brands you know. Thanks for asking, have a great day and enjoy playing the ukulele! =P ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t over think a beginning Ukulele. Try a few at your music store, if you have one. Talk to the people there and ask opinions. Since you are a beginner, though, go with something that feels good to hold, that is not too cheap but not too expensive. Once you have been playing for a while, you will be better able to judge and move up in quality. ",
