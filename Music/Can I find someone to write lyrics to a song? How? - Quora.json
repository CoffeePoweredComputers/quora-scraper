            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. Find a local venue that hosts an \u201copen mic.\u201d Start showing up and listening to the music. Many singer/songwriters like to showcase stuff they\u2019ve written and use these venues. Listen, first off, to see which performers play the style of music you like-you may have to search around for a few different places. Then listen for key phrases in the between song banter. They will normally say if it\u2019s a song they wrote, or give a personal story of the song\u2019s inspiration. Then you need to become a regular. Joe Blow off the street isn\u2019t as important to a performer as is a regular listener. Once you\u2019ve established a report\u2019 with the songwriter, most are always on the prowl for new ideas. Good Luck! ",
