            "answer_text": "As far as i can tell from the people around me, not one voted for Geert Wilders during the last elections. We were terrified that the same scenario could happen in the USA with Mr Trump being elected. Luckily this didn't happen and the largest party in the Netherlands remains the VVD. The PVV did end up second, which is still a bit scary. From what I think, the majority of voters voting for the PVV, the party of Geert Wilders, is low educated (of course not all), has a low income and who are living in the non-urban areas across the country. Usually these people are in the age group of 40\u201380 who believe the world is changing in a bad way, who were raised with the beliefs of Protestantism, Catholicism or no religion at all and believe that the Islam is not bringing the world any good and that Muslims are the source of evil. Well that's pretty sad if you ask me. ",
