I am talking about MICHAEL JACKSON, who, according to Guinness Book of World Records, is \"The most successful entertainer of all time **The actual India is like this-** Daily Schedule of family- **6:00 pm** Dad returns from office. Mom returns from office. Dad goes straight to his room to take a quick half-an-hour nap. Mom goes straight to the kitchen to start preparing for evening meal. For the next hour, I hear the sound of snoring from dad\u2019s room. For the next hour, I hear the sound of pots and pans from the kitchen. \u200b **7:00 pm** Dad wakes up and comes out of his room. Mom comes out of kitchen and enters bathroom. Dad goes to the roof to tend his small rooftop garden - his leisurely hobby. Mom has a lot of laundry to wash - she has no time for hobbies. For the next hour, I hear dad\u2019s footsteps on the rooftop. For the next hour, I hear loud bangs of *\u2018thapi\u2019 *from the bathroom! \u200b **8:00 pm** Dad returns from the roof and turns on the TV. Mom returns from the bathroom and goes back to kitchen. For dad, it\u2019s time for the daily 8 o\u2019clock news. For mom, it\u2019s time to cook dinner for the family of 8. \u200b **9:00 pm** News is over. Dinner is ready. Entire family is munching happily on delicious chapattis. Mom is in the kitchen baking those chapatis. Entire dinner table is overflowing with conversation and laughter. A solitary bang of *\u2018chimta\u2019* on *\u2018tawa\u2019* comes from kitchen, every now and then! \u200b **10:00 pm** For the entire family, the dinner is over. Mom brings out two chapattis and some *\u2018sabzi\u2019 *that was left-over If none, then she happily opens the bottle of *\u2018achaar\u2019*. She doesn\u2019t feel hungry, maybe it\u2019s the power of her *\u2018pyaar\u2019* She has her solitary dinner, with her fifteen minutes with the TV, Meanwhile, the entire family goes to the bed, well-fed and sleepy. \u200b **11:00 pm** One by one, lights of rooms start turning off - Everyone going to sleep after a day well spent. Mom enters back in the kitchen, she still has the night dishes to do, her day is far from over. \u200b \u200b ***And just like that she glides*** ***swiftly between tasks mundane,*** ***sheer pride in serving her family,*** ***and never a whiff of complaint!*** Follow me Here:- Jerry Love (Soumay Saxena) ",

            "answer_text": "OH wait ! That\u2019s not true. I know who was the biggest celebrity to ever visit India, although unfortunately I was only 5 months old at that time. He was 100 times bigger than Justin Bieber in every aspect you can think of, except when it comes to who has more number of haters. I am talking about MICHAEL JACKSON, who, according to Guinness Book of World Records, is \"The most successful entertainer of all time\" and \"The most awarded artist of all time\". YES ! He visited India as a part of his \u2018HIStory World tour\u2019, arriving on October 30, 1996. \u0091Michael Jackson in Mumbai was India\u2019\u0092s greatest gig ever\u0092 (source-Indian Express). MJ being welcomed at Mumbai airport in traditional Marathi style.  Jackson being greeted by Sonali Bendre along with Raj Thackeray, standing to welcome MJ. .  When MJ came to India in 1996 he was welcomed by politicians, actors, singers and most importantly the public of India. MJ overshadowed every other artist of his time. He was the biggest celebrity of that era, just like a living legend. The fuss about Justin Bieber, that you are seeing today, is nothing like what was witnessed back in 1996. Newspapers were flooded with articles about him starting from his simple yet super luxurious life-style to rumors like he sleeps in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to avoid aging ! MJ WAS THE BIGGEST AND MOST FAMOUS CELEBRITY TO EVER VISIT TO INDIA. R.I.P The KING of POP P.S-I don\u2019t like Bieber at all, ugh !!

She is really good!! ",
