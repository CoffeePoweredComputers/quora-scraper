            "answer_text": "Paul McCartney played bass for the Beatles when they played live and on nearly all of their recordings. Early on in the Beatles (before they signed a record contract) they had a friend of John's play bass, Stu Sutcliffe. He died at a young age and at that time John, George and Paul played guitar. One of them had to take on the bass. George was considered the best guitarist and John was the leader at that time and said he wouldn't play bass. That left the bass to Paul. ",
