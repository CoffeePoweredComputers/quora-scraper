Lata was the greatest female singer whereas Rafi is the greatest male singer. He had supreme voice, range, versatility, and capability to change his style according to the actor. Kishore was also a great singer, but his range was not larger as Rafi had. ",

That's a whopping 75 years!It is not correct to name one the best. The term is relative. Everyone must listen to everybody, and judge according to their tastes. There are numerous good singers apart from these. THANKS FOR READING ",
