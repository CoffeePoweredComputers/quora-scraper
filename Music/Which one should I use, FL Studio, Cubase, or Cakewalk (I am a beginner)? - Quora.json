            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a Windows user, which you clearly are, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned Cakewalk. I have taught Cubase in the past, and it is a very powerful, but both it and FL Studio cost. Cakewalk is free, but it used to be the mature and powerful DAW Sonar, with a solid professional user base. I helped a friend set up a small studio with Cakewalk, and he is happy with it. I was able to get into it quite quickly. I\u2019d go along with Jake Arnott and advise that you go for that and see how you feel about making music on computers, before blowing your hard-earned money. You can get all sorts of nice VST plugins to use with it, both instruments and effects, for free, which will greatly extend your options, and even if you decide to go with one of the paid options, these plugins will still be available to your paid-for DAW.

            "answer_text": "Cakewalk is free, so you can find out if recording is something you want to get involved in without a lot of extra expense. If and when you find that the DAW is limiting your creativity, you can consider moving on to a commercial product, and the expertise you\u2019ve developed on Cakewalk should transfer quite quickly. At that point you should be able to investigate which DAW is best for your needs, as you will understand the terminology a lot better, and you may have made friends who can advise you, and you will have a better idea of which features will actually be useful to take you further.
