Stephen Miller, the ultimate racist, will help racist Trump say goodbye to those blacks he is using for now. I guess Kanye doesn\u2019t give a hoot what happens to his family under another Trump win. The only way Trump can win is by cheating and faking it with the blacks. Sad! ",

            "answer_text": "Kanye West has some health issues. When he is off his medication he is susceptible to making mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes allow others to use him. It is easy to write Kanye off as anything other than a victim, but trump is a manipulative individual who is more than happy to take advantage of others. It is sad that Kanye will be an instrument of pain to others who believe him in while being used by trump for political purposes. ",
