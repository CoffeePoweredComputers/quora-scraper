            "answer_text": "Yes, for sure. His songs are all basically the same (to be fair, he doesn\u2019t even write his own songs), he can\u2019t enunciate properly and he can\u2019t hit the notes he\u2019s supposed to sing. You can tell that he\u2019s unable to hit the high notes because the live versions are always a half step lower than the studio versions. You can also tell that his voice was heavily corrected in production because it sounds more metallic at times. Listen to this part of \u201cTreat you better\u201d: \u201cI know I can treat you better Than he can And any girl like you deserves a Gentleman\u201d Singing a half step lower than on the studio version is a common trick used by pop stars (for instance, Katy Perry is guilty of it) because most of the time the audience doesn\u2019t notice the difference. I\u2019m not necessarily faulting all singers for doing so, but they should have some kind of redeeming quality if they don\u2019t have a huge range: personality, inspired songs, anything. Shawn Mendes doesn\u2019t. His songs usually stink of douchebaggery: he portrays himself as a Nice Guy who can\u2019t get the girl he wants in \u201cTreat you better\u201d which is one of the worst things you could say in a love song. Like I said, he\u2019s not really responsible for the awful writing but then what\u2019s interesting about him ?  Anyways, I don\u2019t blame teenagers for liking Shawn Mendes, it\u2019s not like we have perfect taste in music at any given age (and people who claim they do are usually annoying as hell). It\u2019s okay to like him, but I\u2019m more concerned about the production of prepackaged teen stars like Shawn Mendes. These singers (like Justin Bieber before him) are usually pretty young and they get into this messed-up business where they\u2019re supposed to perform on command and they risk losing their fame at any moment. When they\u2019re not profitable anymore they\u2019re usually tossed out and they lose pretty much everything, I don\u2019t really envy them. ",

            "answer_text": "To be completely honest, any musician that is hailed as the best or defining artist of their generation or genre, is almost always highly overrated and open to more than a few aspects of criticism. Shawn Mendes is no exception. His music in question is nothing more than the common style of soft-pop with a twang of acoustic instrumental added to give the appearance that it\u2019s something different when his lyrical content proves otherwise. Constantly his songs deal with the same motifs about heart-break, teenage relationship, and falling love that are ever prevalent in the modern world of pop, but with Mendes\u2019 own signature style of acoustic guitar and slow beats for added effect. Essentially he\u2019s in a genre of his own, which I don\u2019t say as a compliment since if I were to name this genre it would akin the likes of cheap-blues, fake-folk, etc. He\u2019s almost made a mockery of other classic artists such as Eric Clapton and Ricky Nelson. On another hand Mendes is entirely over-marketed. People may say he\u2019s in it for the music and not the money, but a quick look onto his official website store would prove otherwise. $200 basic concert tickets? $10 Official Shawn Mendes Shoelaces? $25 Official Shawn Mendes Beanie? A $40 stuffed lion? His own fragrance line? In short, any argument concerning his charitable acts or personal remarks regarding his financial stance on the music industry, can quickly be shut down for the fact that most middle-class family\u2019s would go bankrupt buying half on Mendes\u2019 merchandise + concert tickets. So, yes, Shawn Mendes is heavily overrated. ",
