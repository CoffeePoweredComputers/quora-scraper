            "answer_text": "Choosing a favorite is incredibly subjective. Three piece bands are pretty rare, and normally require outstanding musicians. By their nature, no member can hide behind the other members, and must actually carry a lot of responsibility. I\u2019m not considering bands like The Who or Led Zepplin, where a fourth member primarily sang, because the question asked for a three member band. My first thought was Cream with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce. But then I remember the impact that The Jimi Hendrix Experience has on me, with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding. But in the end my subjective favorite would be a band that no one is likely to agree with. The James Gang with Joe Walsh, Jimmy Fox and Dale Peters. This was Joe Walsh at his absolute best on guitar. They were a power trio capable of acoustic songs and on occasion Joe switched to keyboards. Their second album, The James Gang Rides Again encompasses all of these styles. And it wasn\u2019t just versatile in the recording studio. Live, Jimmy Fox would go from drums to bass guitar, while Dale Peters went from bass to joining Joe on acoustic guitar. The first three studio albums from 1969 to 1971 are well worth a listen. ",

I\u2019m sure I could find a few others, if I set my mind to it. But end of day, you asked for one band and if I can only choose one, it has to be Nomeansno.  Of course, I was a child when that came out. I was fairly a child when they released this album. However, I feel like it was my first introduction to the band (it was a long time ago, so I can\u2019t be sure. My memory isn\u2019t what it used to be.)  My fondness for the band is in no small part due for their penchant towards amateur existentialism in their lyrics but\u2026 honestly, their drummer is just freaking awesome. By the time I was old enough to see them (they\u2019re a Canadian punk band, so around these parts, they only played bars) they had gone from a 3 person band to a 2 person band (in studio) and finally a 4 person band, but that last bit was only because the drummer had been layering the drum tracks and they needed 2 drummers for some of the songs. Having lost one of their original members, the (main) drummer would occasionally step out from behind his drum kit to do vocals. Here\u2019s a clip from the two-drummer era\u2026  But for the majority of their career, they were a 3 person band. 8 ) ",

            "answer_text": "Mine would have to be Moderat, which is actually a superband formed in 2002 by a duo known as Modeselektor, active since 1996, and a solo artist known as Apparat, also active since 1996. All of them are part of the Berlin electro scene. However, while Apparat\u2019s music is melodic, bright, faint and full of longing (he sings, has explained being \u201cmore interested in designing sounds than beats\u201d, and has included more and more classical instruments in his compositions over the years), Modeselektor\u2019s is very rhythmic, high-powered, self-confident and wicked (nasty bass, techno beats, major chords, R&B influences, occasional collaborations with rap and rock artists). They complement each other really well; it feels like you have both your head in the clouds and your feet solidly anchored in the ground. Who needs drugs when you have music like that? Because the two entities both have released music before coming together, you are able to appreciate what comes from each part of this union, which makes it all the more interesting. Finally, they usually have amazing light design and visuals on their live performances. Moderat live in Berlin (2016):  Modeselektor alone (with a featuring) (2011):  Apparat alone (2011):  Moderat as a superband is currently on a hiatus to pursue separate projects but it\u2019s very possible they come back together someday. Apart from that, I do hope that Depeche Mode, Muse, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Mercury Rev, Leftfield, N*E*R*D, Nirvana, Two Door Cinema Club, Die Antwoord, The xx and Major Lazer make appearances here and there in other people\u2019s answers :-) ",

Back in the mid 80s I was listening to punk( I loved the energy and the lyrics) and I had always listened to rock and metal. Raven was the band that sort of bridged the gap between the two for me. I picked up the Crash,Bang,Wallop ep and it really changed my world. They were heavy and were great musicians, but were really raw and full of energy. I had also heard a song by them called Seek and Destroy off the All for One album that just floored me. They weren\u2019t thrash, but could certainly be called the precursor of. These guys were nuts and I loved it. A great band that still plays today, check em out. ",

            "answer_text": "CREAM, the British 1960s band compiled of Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce. Three guys who had put in their time and logged up so many hours in music that when they first met they jammed for hours and knew it was the right chemistry to create some amazing music. In my view Cream was Eric Clapton\u2019s heyday. Jack Bruce's bass and voice fit perfectly into their sound along with Ginger Baker\u2019s drumming. A threesome rock band stripped down to the bare essentials and all masters of their craft. Every one of their albums hit the spot, likewise their singles, \u2018Badge\u2019, \u2018Sunshine of Your Love\u2019 to name a couple plus some cameos like \u2018 Pressed Rat and Warthog', Tales of Brave Ulysses, Politician And \u2018I Feel Free.\u2018 Many punters vote \u2018 \u2018Disraeli Gears' as their finest album and it is a poweful presentation of what Rock was like before Led Zepplin. For a taste check out their version of \u2018Crossroads' from the \u2018Cream Farewell Concert' movie.  ",

Both bands make fantastic albums but have the ability to back it up live. I've seen both bands on many occasions and have never walked away disappointed. ",
