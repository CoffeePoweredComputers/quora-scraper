            "answer_text": "IT is a very broad field. The difficulty is going to depend on the student\u2019s understanding of computer concepts and the part of IT in which they are majoring. Most IT programs provide a general overview of the entire field with a specialization. These specialization range from web development to network architecture to information security. If you have a thorough understanding of programming principles and decide to specialize in web development, then learning HTML and JavaScript will be much easier than if you began with no prior experience. Some specializations are also more theoretical than others. If you specialize in information security, you will learn about cryptography, which is very mathematical, especially when youstudy the bitwise operations of AES. In summation, if you have some experience with programming, Linux, networks, discrete math, documents, and databases, it will be much easier. Although to reemphasize what others have already mentioned, it depends on the student. ",

How hard is information technology (IT)? Of the computing majors (computer science, information science, information systems, management information systems, and information technology), it\u2019s normally the least mathematical and the least theoretical. Expect to learn about real-world challenges related to configuring and administering information technology, often with a healthy dose of business education. ",
