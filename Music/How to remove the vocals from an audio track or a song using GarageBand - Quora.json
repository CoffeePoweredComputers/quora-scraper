            "answer_text": "Removing vocals (or any other sound) from a song involves removing the audio frequencies in some particular range. But since that particular range of frequencies will have other sounds as well, it is PRACTICALLY impossible to remove vocals without affecting the other sounds. I say \"practically\" because the technology probably exists that will get the job done to a level which a human ear will not be able to detect the quality loss, but it would be much easier to rerecord the song ",
