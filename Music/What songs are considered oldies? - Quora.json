            "answer_text": "It is largely based on the era you grew up or were a young adult in. My local oldies station, WHTG 1410 AM/100.7 FM out of Eatontown, NJ, seems to operate on these rules: The world begins sometime in the early/mid-50\u2019s and ends (with a few exceptions like Gary US Bonds \u2018This Little Girl\u2019) sharply in mid/late 1976. It is a bit of a limiter, but on the other hand, I get to hear the top 40-ish of that era, as opposed to just the top 10-ish. Plus, they play something heard even more rarely; charting covers of oldies performed by artists other than their originators or most popular artist. This station was the first I heard of Stevie Wonder\u2019s cover of \u2018We Can Work It Out\u2019. We will not speak of the banished CBS-FM 101.1, who now considers 1980\u2019s as oldies, and who once transformed into the hated JACK! ",
