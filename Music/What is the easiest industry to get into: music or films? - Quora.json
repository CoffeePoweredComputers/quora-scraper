            "answer_text": "At the risk of being rude, if you\u2019re looking for \u201ceasy,\u201d you shouldn\u2019t be attempting to go into either. When people say it\u2019s really hard to make a living in those industries, they\u2019re right. Jobs are few, you have to work long hours, and do a lot of work for free. So, if you want to go into the arts, you need to have a burning passion. You must be compelled to write, to play, or to work your bloody ass off because you like working your bloody ass off doing that specific thing. I say this because you\u2019ll have to wade through a lot of crap, and only that passion will keep you going. But, if you really wanted to press me for an answer, I\u2019d say that you\u2019re more likely to find work in the film business, in certain cities with a strong film industry, because there are simply more positions available: catering, runner, driver, construction, assistant \u2026 However, not all of those positions pay a living wage. Want to be a production assistant on a no-budget indie short? Sure! You\u2019re in the industry! But will you get paid? Maybe you\u2019ll be on a \u201cdeferred\u201d salary, where you get paid if the film sells. Heh. Heh. Do what you love. Do what gets you up in the morning. Do it because you are driven to do it. But don\u2019t do it because it\u2019s \u201ceasier.\u201d ",
