            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll divide my list into two categories: Vintage period (1935 to 1950):Awaz de Kahan hai from Anmol Ghadi: This was the movie that signaled that Naushad had definitely arrived. With Noor Jehan both on screen and behind the mike, this song is a complete delight and a typical example of the slow, slightly nasal singing style that was characteristic of the vintage period.Karoon kya aas niraas from Dushman: Any discussion of Vintage Music would be incomplete without mentioning the first singing superstar of India K.L.Saigal. I will choose this song over a lot of his more involved renditions like Babul Mora Naihar Chooto Jaye or say Soja Rajkumari because of how appealing and involved it is.Ummeed unse kya thi from Basant: Parul Ghosh, is widely acknowledged to be the first playback singer in India and she was introduced to playback by her brother Anil Biswas. She also sang the unforgettable Papiha re in 1943. Later Anil Biswas moved onto Lata Mangeshkar and Ghosh is hardly remembered except by connoisseurs of vintage music.Door Papiha bola from Gajre: Suraiya was another cornerstone of the vintage era. She always sang simple songs and this one is perhaps the sweetest of her songs.2. The Golden Period (1950\u20131965): All the major players had arrived- Lata, Asha, Geeta Dutt, Rafi, Mukesk, Talat and of course Hemant Kumar. I\u2019ll start with an iconic song. Chhod babul ka ghar from Babul: This song describes a bride leaving her home for her husband\u2019s and is one of the most fantastic adaptations of folk music into film music. We have Shamshad Begum leading the vocals here in her temple bell voice.Yeh zindagi usi ki hai from Anarkali: This songs needs no introduction of course. I personally think its one of the greatest songs ever composed and what amazes me is that it was composed by C. Ramachandra who was and still is known for his lighter numbers like Meri Jaan Sunday ko Aana or mere piya gaye Rangoon.Preetam Aan milo from Mr. and Mrs. \u201855: Before Guru Dutt got all gothic and dark, he made lighter films like Aar Paar, CID and Mr. and Mrs. 55. Here he plays a struggling cartoonist, named Preetam and Geeta Dutt pulls off this majestic number in one fell swoop.Rasik Balma from Chori Chori: Lata Mangeshkar cut her teeth on songs like this. No wonder she went on to become one of the greatest singers in the country.Jaane woh kaise log the jinke from Pyaasa: Love, heartbreak, and finally disillusionment. Hemant Kumar breathes life into this song which talks about entitlement to love.Aaj Sajan mohe ang laga lo from Pyaasa: Based on Bengali folk music, this song is again a wonderful example of folk traditions being used in Bollywood. Geeta Dutt is at her finest here and I can almost feel S.D.Burman going into a trance somewhere as he composes this song.Suhana Safar Aur Yeh Mausam haseen from Madhumathi: Of course, this must have been one of those songs which, even when they were composing, they must have known it would go on to become a hit. This is also one of Mukesh\u2019s best where he is not singing for Raj Kapoor.Seene mein sulagthe hain armaan from Tarana: Here Talat and Lata come together to sing a majestic duet.There were many other songs, but these songs stand out in my memory and are completely unforgettable.
