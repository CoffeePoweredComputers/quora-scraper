            "answer_text": "The Sex Pistols in the 70s, Joe Strummer formed the Clash after the Sex Pistols supported his previous band the 101ers in early\u201976. Many 1st wave UK punk & post punk acts formed after seeing the Pistols live, the Buzzcocks, X Ray Spex, the Fall, Joy Division & Siouxsie Sioux was an early fan. Beyond the UK, the Dead Kennedys & several early LA punk groups and beyond punk Iron Maiden and Guns & Roses. But overall, the Clash\u2019s right-on mix of left wing politics, rock against racism and use of ska, 50s rock n roll, classic soul and other music forms was a template that more punk bands followed in the 80s & 90s rather than the Pistols nihilism. And the Clash influenced Stiff Little Fingers! Both are important and there is no measure of influence, just opinions. ",
