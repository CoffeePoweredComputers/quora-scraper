            "answer_text": "Yes, you can sing if you want to. I like Demi Lovato's version more than the movie ver. It has better vocals. If you can sing in flow and go higher then you could try \u201cHow far I'll go\" by Alessia Cara, It sounds better than let it go to me (^_^\u2019) And if not Disney then songs like Titanium by Madilyn Bailey vr. , Dusk till Dawn (acoustic) etc. Anyway, Yes you can sing Let it go. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can sing any song in an audition. But if I had to advise, I'd say never go for songs that are in trend in Korea or songs from artists of the company you're auditioning in. Secondly, I'm assuming you aren't Korean, I'd say you should sing a Korean ballad or something because that'd show you know Korean and also showcase your pronunciation, intonation, accent,etc. ",
