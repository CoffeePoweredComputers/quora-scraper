            "answer_text": "Not sure what you mean by \u201crelevant.\u201d They are still very beautiful, if that is what you like in music. Music after the Baroque still grows and develops from patterns laid down in those earlier periods. They can still be a challenge to singers, a showcase for their art. I mean, shit, yes, Josquin, and Hildegard of Bingen, and Purcell and the rest are as relevant as music can be, and for pitys sake, BACH!? Would you really contend that J.S. Bach\u2019s music, vocal or otherwise, is somehow not \u201crelevant\u201d today? ",

You ask if Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music\u2019s still relevant, and yet it's in movie scores, TV miniseries, ringtones, TV ads, and even children's cartoons. It's sampled and repurposed in awful pop tunes. You just don't recognize it, unless you're a fan.  ",

We are talking about music that dates back to 1200 and certainly people do not whistle it in the street but nevertheless it is performed and has its own programming circuit and also circulates via cd and dvd.
