            "answer_text": "First and foremost I would like to say that it all depends on what you want your sound to be like. There are variety of setups to choose from in that range. There are single coils, humbuckers, combination of both and what not. Fender Squier Stratocaster Standard (20\u201324k) With a wide variety of Squiers to choose from, it's easy to lose track of what model you're looking at while starting out as a new electric guitarist.  An absolutely beautiful guitar with single coil pickups and maple fingerboard comes in 3 variants: Candy apple red, Black and Antique Burst. Also it has a tremolo and can bear normal wear and tear and is good for learning and gigging. Mostly used for playing blues, country, pop and classic rock. Fender Squier Standard Stratocaster Maple Electric Guitar Ibanez GRG250DX (28\u201330k) A guitar with a combination of Humbuckers and Single coil pickups definitely offers some great versatility and sounds to experiment with. Comes with rosewood fingerboard and 5 way switch. Mostly used for heavier styles of music like Rock and Metal but then again it's versatility can be utilized efficiently in the right hands.  Ibanez GRG250DX Electric Guitar Sterling by Music Man AX3S-R1 (29\u201332k) An original, classic design, the AX3 features a 5-way selector, asymmetrical neck, and vintage style tremolo. Two Humbuckers with 5-way switch offers some great tone variety. One great thing about this guitar is that it has a Jatoba fingerboard which is unusual for a guitar at this price point and is thus worth checking out.  Sterling by Music Man AX3S-R1 Electric Guitar Schecter Omen 6 (25\u201328k) A great guitar with two Humbuckers excellent for gigging and heavy music. This guitar sure as hell can take a beating and still be able to produce mostrous sounds. One downside is that this guitar has a 'string-thru' body which means that it can't have a tremolo system. But don't let that diminsih this guitar's monstrosity. It's available in 3 beautiful colours as well.  Schecter Omen 6 Electric Guitar There are still 'n' number of guitars available in this price range. You should definitely head to your nearest store to check each guitar out but keep an eye on the ones mentioned above ",

            "answer_text": "In your price range , the brands you mentioned will get you the lower end models . The sound of an electric guitar is almost wholly based on the pick-ups used in the guitar. PRS/Gibson/Fender/ESP are all among the most popular brands , but you get the real deal out of them when you go around and over Rs 50k-60k range. In your range , I would rather suggest you to look for brands like Cort and Schecter . These will provide you better built and pick-ups in your range.  I own a Cort EVL K6 with EMG 81/85 (active) pickups for over 5 years now and it's one of the best deals I could ever have ! It's in and around your range , I think around 31k . Those pickups can crank up the hell out of anything . A guitar of the brands you mentioned with EMG 81/85 would not cost under 50-55k . So there lies the point of limited budget . I would definitely recommend Cort EVL K6 . Extremely well built and a beast at sounding . Plug that guitar into a tube amp for a show and you can get the exact sound as the greatest of guitarists do ! There so many rock and metal legends who have been swearing by EMGs throughout there career . In my opinion Cort EVL K6 is the best deal you can get around your price range.  And like I said , the sound of the electric guitar lies in the pick-ups , the set of pickups installed on that guitar will make it a life-long love of you ! Hope that helps ! Cheers. ",
