Yes Lilith Pheebs is correct, music at certain frequencies can give you chills, and if it has certain emotion in it, it will give you chills, but music also has a psychological effect on people. Music is often used for persuasion. Example, most potheads listen to music about drugs. Music has a hypnotic effect as well. ",

            "answer_text": "So Cruel by U2. I think that anyone who has been in a relationship where it feels like you are investing in the relationship more than your partner is can relate to this song. The lyric \u2018Desperation is a tender trap, it gets you every time, you put your lips to her lips to stop that lie\u2019 definitely leaves a lump in my throat. When people in your life that care for you start to tell you that the person isn't right for you or that they are just not into you and it won't last yet you stay because you love them..You secretly hope that they will return the love eventually.. and they never do\u2026 Yeah. This song definitely has given me goosebumps because of its emotional lyrics and haunting melody ",
