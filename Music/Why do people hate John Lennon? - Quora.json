            "answer_text": "Some people hate John Lennon-most don\u2019t. Those who do, IMHO, generally fall into these 5 categories: The ones who still blame John-and who blame Yoko even more-for the breakup of The Beatles-even though everyone else in the band has agreed for decades that they would have broken up no matter what at some point in 1969 or 1970, that they simply couldn\u2019t work together cohesively anymore and hadn\u2019t been working together well since at least the time of Sgt. Pepper. At this stage, those people are basically just blaming John for the fact that their own youths ended and they got old just like everybody else does.Some-but far from all-of those who were on Paul\u2019s side in the breakup and preferred Paul\u2019s music to John\u2019s. I\u2019m fairly sure Paul would pretty much tell these people to get over themselves already. Paul moved on-why can\u2019t THEY?People with right-wing politics who hate John for becoming a major part of the anti-Vietnam War movement-and also for speaking out for socialist political and economic ideas, against racism-half the reason the Beatle burnings happened in the South, aside from the \u201cmore popular than Jesus\u201d thing, was that The Beatles had been the first major act to insist on playing to integrated audiences in all parts of the country- for gay and lesbian rights(btw, it\u2019s likely that, were he living today, John would be speaking out and marching for all the groups included in the LGBTQ umbrella) ; in solidarity with the Native American struggle, and for an end to British rule in Northern Ireland. These principles earned John the undying hostility of those who think pop and rock music should be stupid, meaningless, and totally out of touch with the world where music is made.People who have issues with the flaws in John\u2019s personal behavior-even though he rectified most of those flaws in the last decade of his life-and are obsessed with calling him out as a hypocrite because he wrote idealistic music without actually being a saint. It\u2019s my view that at least some of the people who go after John about this aspect of his life are secretly members of group #3, and are trying to delegitimize John\u2019s idealism by pointing out that he was-like most of us-a flawed, sometimes contradictory person.People who have some sort of a score to settle with John\u2019s legacy on a personal level-either people who worked for John and were fired by him; people who thought they should have been given control over John\u2019s legacy instead of Yoko; people who were pissed off because he was, as he could sometimes be, personally harsh towards them(this group seems to include his son Julian, who had his own reasons for how he felt towards his father).",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think people hate John Lennon per se. I think their negative feelings have a lot more to do with the heavily glorified image of John Lennon. John knew he was flawed and although he was in denial about many of his mistakes for much of his life, he would also speak of the things he\u2019d done wrong. However, he never really took responsibility for his actions. Instead of owning up to his leading role in the Beatles breakup, he always put most of the blame on others (mainly Paul). Instead of being honest about his hypocrisy, he would point at other people\u2019s flaws. Even when he did admit to making mistakes, it was always paired with some for of \u201cbut he/she/they\u2026.\u201d and he never paid anyone a compliment without tearing them down in the next breath. He seemed to have been changing by 1980, and he had some serious plans about getting his life on track. He and Yoko were in the early stages of divorce, and John was recording again. He had big plans to reunite with Paul, and was hoping for a prober Beatles reunion. Sadly, he never got to finish any of the things he started because his life was cut short. After his death, the Saint Lennon narrative grew larger than life. All of John\u2019s transgressions were swept under the rug. His Beatles plans and the imminent divorce were treated as if they never existed, and Yoko took centre stage, playing the grieving widow. To gain even more sympathy, she pushed Sean forward as John\u2019s only son, attempting to make the world forget about Julian, whom she treated horribly. Aided by Jann Wenner and the many John Lennon worshippers, Yoko never ceased to paint this embellished image of a perfect John Lennon, with whom she had the perfect marriage. His flaws were glossed over or denied outright, whereas other people\u2019s perceived mistakes and wrongdoings were grossly exaggerated (mostly Paul\u2019s and George\u2019s). These days, we have a far better understanding of what John was like, and it\u2019s so different from the JohnAndYoko narrative that it rubs people the wrong way. They\u2019re not looking to hate anyone or to knock heroes off of pedestals. They just want the truth. They can\u2019t seem to get it, and that causes annoyance and a strong dislike of the fabricated image. To me, that\u2019s what\u2019s truly happening. ",
