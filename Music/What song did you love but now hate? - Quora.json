            "answer_text": "tw//nsfw Freaky Friday by Lil Dicky and Chris Brown. I\u2019ve watched a lot of movies since the pandemic hit. Recently though, I\u2019ve watched some of the Freaky Friday movies (the Disney ones, I think there\u2019s more movies than the Disney ones? I digress). And needless to say, I have learned a couple of things from watching these: I\u2019ll never wish to be someone else unless I can be Obi Wan Kenobi in Mandalorian armor. Then I\u2019ll wish to be Obi Wan Kenobi in Mandalorian armor.This song got the entire premise of Freaky Friday wrong. Very, very, wrong.I\u2019m going to summarize the Lindsay Lohan one and compare it to the song (the music video is based off the Chinese restaurant thingie, plus I think this one is the most well known), and I\u2019ll then explain what they got wrong. Freaky Friday movie: Anna and her mother switch bodies after arguing in a Chinese restaurant the night before her mom\u2019s wedding rehearsal and eating a magic fortune cookie. They have to pretend to be each other (obviously), and while doing that they learn about each others struggles (Anna\u2019s band and her school life, her mom\u2019s patients and being on a show unannounced, etc.) and begin to understand each other. They then switch bodies back at the end because Anna\u2019s mom tells her to postpone the wedding she was having to make Anna happy, but Anna decides to get \u201cmarried\u201d to him because he made her mom happy. The song (I\u2019m also going to use a part from the music video because it\u2019s connected to the song and is important) Lil Dicky is upset that he\u2019s not more famous. Chris Brown is upset that he\u2019s too famous. They both wish to be someone else for a day, so they switch bodies. Lil Dicky is like \u201ccool, I\u2019m Chris Brown now and fucking famous so I cAn sAy tHE n wORd nOW\u201d, plus posting his dick on Twitter because apparently consent doesn\u2019t exist? Meanwhile, Chris Brown is in Dicky\u2019s body, and enjoys white privilege, not being famous and being able to wear blue now even though he\u2019s a blood, before freaking out because he realizes Lil Dicky has his body and he\u2019s being an idiot in it (i.e. shouting \u201cI\u2019m Chris Brown\u201d, posting his dick on Twitter, wondering if he even sent his kid to school, etc), before showing up to a club where Dicky in his body is at. He doesn\u2019t want to let Chris in, so Chris goes full psycho mode and tries to attack Dicky, before they realize they shouldn\u2019t kill each other and apparently they need to \u201clove each other more\u201d before switching back? Oh yeah, and then Lil Dicky jumps into Ed Sheeran\u2019s body, saying it\u2019s not as cool as being Chris Brown, shouts \u201cI\u2019m DJ Khaled!\u201d in DJ Khaled\u2019s,and violates Kendall Jenner\u2019s body while in hers.  Let\u2019s review what\u2019s wrong with this: In the Freaky Friday movie, Anna and her mom learn to appreciate each other and understand their struggles. In this song, we learn it\u2019s awesome to be Chris Brown and that Lil Dicky doesn\u2019t understand the concept of consent.A ton of things go wrong in the movie. Like, a ton. (Examples: Anna being on a show about her mom\u2019s book, and as she hasn\u2019t read it, she goes off on a funny tirade. Her mom performing with Anna\u2019s band and not knowing how to play guitar, so Anna in her mom\u2019s body plays guitar from backstage.) Nothing other than \u201coh shit Dicky put my dick on Twitter and my daughter may or may not be in school\u201d goes wrong in this song. I know it\u2019s a song, and won\u2019t be as long as a movie (for obvious reasons), but they could both at least learn to understand the struggles of being famous/trying to get famous or something.If the song wanted to parody the movie, cool. But try to keep it accurate, a tiny bit, or at least make it make sense if you\u2019re going to deviate. The message made no sense. Why would Chris Brown need to love himself more? Also, having stuff go wrong is interesting. It\u2019s funny.  Another thing: why is Lil Dicky such a creep? I was 11 when this song came out, and didn\u2019t really understand that what Lil Dicky was talking about was creepy and wrong but I\u2019m 14 now and fucking understand now. Apparently, he thinks it\u2019s okay to post Chris Brown\u2019s dick on Twitter without his consent,and jerk off in Kendall\u2019s body, again, without her consent. I know, I\u2019m getting fucking heated over a song, but why is this in the song? (Also, I\u2019m sure Lil Dicky wrote that part. If Chris and Kendall did, fuck them too. How did that even get approved as lyrics for the song?)  Finally, why Chris Brown? Why, out of all the people Dicky could\u2019ve wanted to trade places with, did he choose one of the most terrible people in music? (Note: I like Chris Brown\u2019s music, so Chris Brown stannies in the comments, don\u2019t accuse me of being a jealous hater or whatever you want to come up with. I just don\u2019t agree with his actions and can\u2019t condone them.) Remember the part where Dicky is in Ed Sheeran\u2019s body, and he thinks it\u2019s not as cool as being Chris Brown? Bitch. Ed Sheeran Is Fucking Cool. He\u2019s one of my favorite singers, isn\u2019t in fucking legal trouble all the damn time, and was in one of my favorite movies of all time, Yesterday. (If you haven\u2019t seen this movie: Even if you don\u2019t like The Beatles or Ed Sheeran,watch the movie. You will not regret it. It\u2019s one of the funniest, most wholesome movies I\u2019ve ever seen.) Speaking of Yesterday, I have a better idea for how this song could\u2019ve gone: What if Dicky was jealous because Ed gets to be in a movie that isn\u2019t even about him, playing himself, and Ed was stressed because of the movie? What if they switched bodies, and Ed kinda got bored being Dicky or not being used to not being famous and getting upset because of it? What if Dicky had to figure out his lines in the movie, and just came up with his own? Better yet, what if the idea of Debra (Ed\u2019s manager in the movie) or something like that didn\u2019t exist, and Dicky came up with it? That\u2019d be a cool song. But of course, we\u2019re stuck with this mess. Sigh. ",
