            "answer_text": "let me tell you a story: There was this gall who I\u2019d positively describe as \u201chot\u201d\u2026 One day we just chilled around doing nothing in particular except for being your average douchebags and listening to music blaring from our phones while drinking a few beers. The fun part was, she actually was into industrial, ebm, elektro, such things. So, unsurprisingly with said genres, \u2019bout half the tracks were about (kinky) sex of just about any kind\u2014the other half about death, destruction and the downfall of society\u2026 did that mean anything besides our taste in music at least partially overlapping? No, it didn\u2019t, we just had fun being douchebags. Basically, what I am trying to get at, just because the music happens to fit any feelings you might or might not have towards someone is plain random happenstance. And especially with love songs seeing as there are so many of those that it allmost hurts. That does of course not mean that you shouldn\u2019t tell her about your feelings if you wish to, just don\u2019t interpret randomness as anything other then randomness. ",

            "answer_text": "No it means nothing at all, and no matter what anyone tells you, human beings tend to romanticize relationships, so we like to \u201chype them up\u201d so to say in order to feel like we\u2019ve accomplished our life. Now, if you wanted to use that information it would mean that you listened to songs with a girl you happen to like weather that be for legitimate reasons or weather you know or not you know her well it means what you experienced was a coincidence, and purely one. If you really wanted to know if she was a good mate choice for you, then you would probably have to read lots and lots, and I will NOT explain anything because it is long, and tedious and down-right moronic at times. So if you know what to look for, then sure, but just using my assumption based knowledge, she doesn\u2019t know you like her, you probably don\u2019t know her too well. And statistically speaking it would be almost impossible for her to be compatible, so, sorry kid. But she (probably) isn\u2019t the \u201cone\u201d. ",
