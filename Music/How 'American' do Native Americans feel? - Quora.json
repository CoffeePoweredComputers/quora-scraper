            "answer_text": "Well, let's see.  By \"feel American\" do you mean \"feel Patriotic?\"  The Native Americans I know feel VERY Patriotic, VERY American.  And, they are not shy about telling you that either. Historically Natives were proud to fight for their country.  Ever see the statue of the flag raising on Iwo Jima?  The guy in the back is Ira Hayes, a Pima who was a Corpsman with the US Marine Corps. Ever heard of the \"Wind Talkers?\"  They were WW II code talkers that talked in their own language, Navajo.  The Japanese never could decipher their code.  There is a museum in Kayenta, AZ  dedicated to the Wind Talkers.  Wind Talkers were US Marines. Near where I live is the Yavapai Apache Nation.  Close to election time I have gotten into some good political \"discussions\", good as in intelligent, passionate arguments without fist fights, with Natives. On that same Yavapai Apache Nation land is a casino.  Every patriotic holiday expect a very large celebration complete with fireworks.  If you are a veteran tell them you are a vet.  They will invite you in to one of the restaurants for a free meal.  In one of the casino rooms is a \"Hall of Fame.\"  It's covered with pictures of tribal members who either are or were in the US Military.  Most of the pictures are of Marines! Do Native Americans \"feel American?\"  Around here you can bet your own money on it, it's a safe bet, you can't loose.  Semper Fi my brothers. ",

Example: A wake is the last party the dead attend on this side, so they get roasted and toasted. Jokes are told about them, stories of what they did from the time they first peed in a diaper to why they forgot where the bathroom was at age 101. The acts of heroism are told and retold, she was a great other, brave, but do not ever touch one of her kids! He was a wonderful dad and gave everything, his life, for his children, went to war and came home wounded in body and soul, yet you would never know it.  If someone is bad, they dropped in the ground by silent people and if very bad, a cedar is planted over the grave. then, the person was forgotten, not even mourned. twice dead, you might say. We're American as apple pie and yet each is his or her own person, as it meant to be. we're (name a people, name a state) and proud of it, and that we, far more than any other race, put more sons in the military to defend the important people, the children, women, the elderly. We live, we thrive because we are the People. ",

            "answer_text": "Most Natives in the US think of themselves as dual citizens, both of the US and their tribal nation. Some like the Iroquois think of themselves as only citizens of their own tribe. The Iroquois strip the voting and other rights of any who vote in US elections. They also insist upon enlisting as foreign nationals. Patriotism has a different meaning for most Native people compared to most others. It means love of the land and of their own people, not of the US system which has been very abusive. I recall one Navajo vet saying for him love of country was not \"the flag and Mom's apple pie.\" It was \"Dinetah and Mom's mutton stew.\" Dinetah is the Navajo homeland. Mutton is the center of the Navajo diet. You do see the highest enlistment rates among Natives, and you do see both US and Canadian flags carried in the Grand Entry at powwows like below. Notice that the staff adorned with eagle feathers is also in the entry and commonly referred to as a flag.    But that certainly is not \"conventional\" patriotism. The flag, for one thing, gets used in vastly different ways than you'd see others use it.                    ",

Given the paucity of educational material on the \u201cFirst Americans\u201d their story does not figure large in the classroom. I have actually visited a native \u201creservation\u201d and the conditions there were appalling. Their housing would be considered substandard in the Third World, they all looked underfed, and I saw no real attempts at education. Some groups were lucky - the Mohegans were farmers and had the good sense to file for titles on their land as soon as the \u201cPilgrims\u201d first showed up. As far as I know, their ancestors are still living and thriving on the East Coast. The ones who had been pushed into the \u201cworthless\u201d desert lands of the west also filed for titles to their land and ended up owning a substantial amount of property in what became Las Vegas. But these are small victories compared to the injustices visited upon the mass of those still living on barren land with barren futures. So I would have to say that what most Americans feel today towards Native Americans is - indifference. ",

Before this juncture only individuals who were members of federally recognized tribes and \u201cnaturalized\u201d individuals were given the rights of a United States citizen. Presently all Native Americans born within the territorial limits of the United States are by law citizens. Native Americans have had the privilege of voting in national elections since 1924; however, until recently some states prohibited Native Americans from voting in local elections. New Mexico, for example, did not extend the vote to Native Americans until 1962. Most native people, of course, also are members of their respective sovereign tribes.  ",
