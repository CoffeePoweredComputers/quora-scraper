            "answer_text": "Is paying for piano sheet music worth it? If the music is copyright, downloading it without paying for it is stealing. It is stealing from the copyright owners, who may be the original creator(s), the family of the creators, the company which has gone to the expense of publishing and distributing the music, or a combination of two of these. If the music is no longer in copyright, there may still be good reasons to pay for a copy. (Some of the following are also additional reasons for paying for copyright music.) You can freely copy works of great composers from sites like Free Public Domain Sheet Music (IMSLP) But, sometimes the out of copyright versions are inferior to recent editions, which are often more accurate, are easier to read, and frequently look better, due to quality engraving techniques. They also often include helpful fingering suggestions and articles about how to play the music, and information about the composer(s).When people download a copy of a piece they want to play, they may be depriving themselves of other great music that is included alongside that piece in a sheet music album. When you have the whole book, you may later discover other pieces you\u2019d never heard of, and would only learn of in the album the piece you love came from.If you want to continue to own copies of sheet music, it is worth supporting the people who create, engrave, publish and distribute it.It can be easier to store books of published music than sheets of printer paper, in my experience.Sheet music books can be easier to sort through than piles of printer paper. If you remember the cover of the book, you may be able to find it more easily, when you are looking through your collection.It\u2019s easy to love an old book, which may stir up pleasant memories of where you were when you first owned it. Today my wife and I played through some of Mouquet\u2019s Cinq Pi\u00e8ces Br\u00e8ves. This reminds us of living in the Blue Mountains, and of her flute teacher Naomi Halls, from maybe 25 years ago. It\u2019s just not the same with bits of paper. Would we be able to find the old copy, if that\u2019s all it was?Published sheet music, even single copies, but especially books, are more durable.",

            "answer_text": "I understand your question, but I am having trouble accepting its premise. What is the reason why you do not want to pay for it? Perhaps you don\u2019t understand that musicians make a living from concert ticket sales, sales of recordings and streaming (which are almost nonexistent these days), merchandise (T-shirts), and sales of sheet music of their songs. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to make a living as a musician, and there\u2019s a good chance that if you have a steady job, you make more than the average pro musician, you have better job security, and you have far better health insurance and social security. Anyone who is truly a fan of music will support the musicians of whom they are fans. Do you go to see your favorite pro sports team by sneaking in at the stadium? Probably not. Now, work out who is your favorite musician and buy one of their song books. If it isn\u2019t pop music you are after, find out if the sheet music is available for sale, and buy it. Even if the musician has been dead for some time, his / her children or grandchildren can benefit from sheet music sales. ",
