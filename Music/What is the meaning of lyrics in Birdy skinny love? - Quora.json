This piece was written by a gentleman by the name of Mark Brown and this is the best theory on the song meaning that I have ever seen or could express myself.

I'd say he is comparing the true nature of love to our modern facsimile.\u00c2 Skinny love is our modern pale copy that is but a veneer and lasts but a year.\u00c2 And that is ok because it is disposable.\u00c2 It might cause some blood and scrapes when you break out of that skinny love, but that just makes your skin tougher.\u00c2 Real love cuts the rope and falls.\u00c2 It wrecks all of that pretty picture of the veneer.\u00c2 Skinny love is balanced and fine.\u00c2 Real love, as Saint Paul would say, is patient and kind.\u00c2 But the one who is patient and kind is the lover.\u00c2 In the song the one who has skinny love is putting those on his skinny love object.\u00c2 Instead of being the giving gospel, skinny love is the demanding law.\u00c2 Do this and in the morning I'll be with you.\u00c2 Real love is there regardless.\u00c2 Skinny love pastes over the problems in a lite brassier.\u00c2 Real love feels the load.\u00c2 Which do you want?\u00c2 Who will you love?\u00c2 Who will you fight?\u00c2 Who will fall far behind?
