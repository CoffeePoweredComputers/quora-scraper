            "answer_text": "To be honest, no, not really (As you can read from my credentials, I\u2019ll only be judging Drake on the rap side of things, so Drake fans, get off my case) (I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll be answering cleanly, my last answer to this sort of topic got collapsed, so) I rarely ever hear him rap, like, the only time I heard him rap was in Forever, and that had the likes of Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Eminem in it. Yes I do hear him at times try to sing-rhyme Taylor Swift style as if he was some kind of Nate Dogg wannabe or something. See, he\u2019s being put alongside the likes of Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj, and while both of which are just as bad as rappers (though Lil Wayne is capable of being semi-decent), he looks like Rihanna amongst Metallica, it simply doesn\u2019t work. I can sort of see where Drake is trying to aim at with his versatile style of music making, but it doesn\u2019t work that way, it\u2019s almost like thinking Maths was the same as Economics, though it has some corelation, it\u2019s absolutely not the same, you can mix heavy metal and rock and roll since it\u2019s got a lot of similarities, if not exactly the same, but hip-hop and pop music is a proper mess that rarely ever works, just look at Christina Aguilera\u2019s Dirrty music video featuring Redman or Taylor Swift\u2019s Bad Blood music video featuring Kendrick Lamar and you\u2019ll know what I mean That\u2019s all I got to say, Drake doesn\u2019t satisfy my hip-hop needs, in fact, it actually upsets my hip-hop needs, I\u2019m off to listen to a load of rappers people recommended in the comment section of my now collapsed answer, I\u2019m starting with Immortal Technique from here.

I even got to see Drake in concert and totally loved it. I went with my 21 year old daughter. His concert is one of the most memorable concerts I've ever been to. And this is coming for a 50+ year old woman. Drake is the BOMB! ",
