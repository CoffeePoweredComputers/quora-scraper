            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s music is the same as yesterday\u2019s music; all the same notes and all the same scales. Only you have changed. When you were young old people said the same thing about your generation\u2019s music. When you were young you looked at the world as a bright new amazing place and you loved music. Now that you are old you have moved from optimism to cynicism. You are just stodgy and sentimental. Music hasn\u2019t changed that much. So go ahead and shake your cane at young kids riding by your house on skateboards.  ",

            "answer_text": "No, definitely a NO, musicians are evolving so much than ever it had happened, now that you have better DAW\u2019s and software\u2019s which help you make better sounding music with dexterity. Outstanding records are made even now.The quality of the production and the mixing is much better than earlier days.Though Analog instruments are good for all time, you could even go for the software synthesizers and digital samples. There are few artists who make music from every samples one among my favorite ANDREW HUANG So don\u2019t believe the fact that these days music are noise. ",
