            "answer_text": " Of course it is NOT wrong for men to cry! In fact, it is VITAL. If a person does not cry when they need to cry, then they are asking for trouble. And trouble will come. Depression may set in, and the person may become suicidal\u2026 or lash out in anger toward others\u2026 Or drink to excess\u2026. They may develop ulcers or get cancer - yes, cancer is indeed stress related - or develop migraines\u2026.  Real men DO cry. A real man is not afraid of what other people may say when he does cry, and he does not refuse to cry out of shame or fear of how others may see him. Emotionally abusing a male for actually crying is very wrong and is subjugating the male, it encourages depression and suicide tendencies, as well as anger issues. The fact that males continue to suppress their feelings, and to torment those who do show their emotions, ensures that this wrongness will continue. And yes - I am fully aware that certain abusive females verbally and emotionally abuse males for crying and showing their emotions, and I know that this is highly traumatic and - to be blunt - very evil. A person crying when they grieve and are in pain is normal - for both genders, and should only ever be seen as natural and normal. To not be able to cry is ABnormal, just as being afraid to cry for fear of abuse when one does, is highly stressful and this abuse is highly traumatic.  I personally, am going to have a lot more respect for a male who DOES show his emotions, who DOES cry and express his feelings. He is then REAL. There is NO shame in crying - and anyone who claims otherwise is an emotional abuser, no matter who they are - but there is shame in attacking someone for doing so; and in refusing to cry and holding all your emotions in. This is like running around with a grenade in your hands waiting for it to explode. It is no wonder so many men are always so very angry when they continue to bottle all their emotions up! BOTH genders NEED to cry - it is essential. They also NEED to talk about and express their emotions and feelings.  There are some extremely dangerous and nasty expressions:- \u2018big boys don\u2019t cry\u2019 - of course that expression is complete and utter bullshit. Big boys are not afraid of their emotions and are not afraid or ashamed to cry.\u2018crying is for sissies\u2019 - another derogatory term that is aimed to shame and belittle.\u2018only girls cry\u2019/ \u2018you play/cry like a girl\u2019 / \u2018don\u2019t be a girl\u2019 - well that is simply sexist toward BOTH genders. And only a person who is actually afraid of their own feelings and is extremely insecure about their own sexuality and who they are, could ever stoop so very low.\u2018What are you, a homo?\u2019 - Accusing a male of being a homosexual because he shows emotions, and cries etc is rude and insensitive. If a homosexual is in touch with his feelings that is awesome, but so too should a heterosexual be.Whoever came up with the crap that it is shameful and wrong for men to cry has a hell of a lot to answer for. The blood of all those men who were taught this, and ended up killing themselves as a result because they simply could not face life anymore, is on their hands. It is not only vitally important for men TO cry, but for them to allow their sons and daughters and wives, and any other loved ones, to see them crying. This shows the children that crying is ok, and normal and natural, which means that they will not be afraid to do so themselves, and they will not feel so very insecure and uncomfortable around others who do. It also means that the wives will not feel so embarrassed and uncomfortable when they themselves cry. Sometimes women do cry simply from hormones and if they are made out to feel like blubbering and or manipulative idiots because of their tears - this is not at all conducive for a healthy relationship! A boy who see\u2019s his father crying knows that it is ok for him to cry as a male when he is a child and when he is a man. In life, one can come upon so very many travesties:- children kidnapped\u2026parents die..children die\u2026pets die\u2026war\u2026illness\u2026fire\u2026famine\u2026grave slander\u2026unjust jail\u2026homeless\u2026jobless\u2026There are so very many reasons TO cry, and even simply a terribly sad story -on screen, pages, or stage etc - can bring tears if we are moved enough. There is never any shame in actually being in touch with ones emotions. \u2026.When a new baby is born it is natural to cry. When we finally get a positive test result after waiting so long\u2026 When your child comes home again after years apart\u2026 When your friend recovers from illness\u2026 Real men DO cry. More importantly, they are not ashamed of doing so. They own their tears. They embrace their emotions. And a person who can embrace ALL their emotions can be a WHOLE person - whether male or female. If they cannot cry, then there is something missing\u2026  And it starts at the very beginning, when some idiot tells a little boy:- \u201cbuckle up and be a MAN, big boys don\u2019t cry\u201d. Don\u2019t ever, ever believe that LIE. We ALL cry! There is NO shame in crying. No shame in tears. It is NOT wrong for men to cry. It is very, very wrong to shame a man or a small male child, for crying - that is extremely shameful and abusive and wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Men have always cried. Yet the acceptability of male crying has varied across time and across culture. There are many references to man tears in ancient Greek and Roman culture. In Homer\u2019s The Iliad there is no conflict between Odysseus\u2019 heroic qualities and the inclusion of many episodes of his weeping for home, loved ones, and fallen comrades. Yet Odysseus never breaks down out of loneliness or frustration, which the ancient Greeks did not feel were acceptable reasons for men to cry. They also expected warriors to understand that there were times when public displays of emotion were acceptable, and times when it was appropriate to cry alone. Odysseus frequently tries to hide his tears from those around him. The Old Testament is similarly replete with references to weeping. The ancient Hebrews wept as part of their supplications to God and before going to battle. The Gospel writers did not feel that tears were a threat to either the manhood or godhood of Christ and dutifully recorded that \u201cJesus wept.\u201d Perhaps drawing inspiration from this emotional display, early church thinkers considered tears a gift and a natural accompaniment to spiritual, even transcendent, experiences. The great theologian Thomas Aquinas, like the ancient Greeks, made the distinction between the very public weeping that had characterized Hebraic culture, and the idea that it was frequently best to cry away from people\u2019s prying eyes. Medieval Japanese and European epics are chock full of male crying. The great warriors in both Beowulf and The Tale of Heiki cry buckets over both great spiritual questions and the death of comrades. The warriors in such stories are expected to cry about issues of war, peace, and ideals, while the women weep over romantic and platonic relationships or out of general sadness, loneliness, or frustration. Up through the Romantic Era, a permissive, even celebratory attitude toward male crying prevailed. Popular culture was of full of sentimental literature and art featuring men and women falling into each other\u2019s arms and bathing one another with their tears. Tears were seen as proof of a man\u2019s sincerity, honesty, and integrity. But the Enlightenment ushered in a more rational ideal of manhood. Tears came to be seen not as an unmitigated virtue, but as sometimes manipulative, illogical, and false. During the Victorian Era, those virtues thought to be exclusively feminine in nature were celebrated. Women were seen as dainty and fragile, full or emotion and love. Tears have always had a vulnerable and submissive quality to them, and began to be seen as more befitting a woman than a man. As the 20th century emerged, the ideal of the tearless male emerged with it. The Man Cry Today Culture\u2019s view of male crying has continued to evolve into our day. While we still expect men to cry less than women, in some cases it has now become more acceptable for a man to cry than a woman, at least when it comes to our public officials. Hillary Clinton\u2019s tears in New Hampshire brought some compassion, but also criticism that such vulnerability made her ill-suited for leadership. Yet Mitt Romney choked up several times on various news programs without the slightest attention being paid to it. Many see tears as proof that a man is sensitive and humble and thus well-rounded. Which leaves men in a gray area when it comes to crying in the modern age. Some people these days encourage men to let loose whenever the urge hits. Some adhere to the \u201cyou can\u2019t squeeze tears from a stone\u201d philosophy. I think the key to male crying lies somewhere between these two edicts. A man need not be perpetually stoic. There are, of course, times when we feel sorrow or frustration so acutely that it must be let out. Yet there\u2019s a balance between being so sensitive that a Hallmark commercial can make you weep and shedding some tears over something truly significant. Just as there is a balance between releasing some man tears and turning into the kind of blubbering mess that makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Here are some appropriate and inappropriate times to get your cry on. When It\u2019s Okay for a Man to Cry  1. The death of a loved one. There are few things more painful than the thought of separation from those dearest to our hearts. 2. The death of your beloved pet. A pet can feel like a member of the family. Whether a horse or dog, the bond between a man and his faithful animal runs deep. 3. When you first see the new life you and your wife created. Many a man has found himself choked up as they cradle their newborn son or daughter. 4. When you propose to the love of your life and she says yes. This should be one of the happiest days of your life. You found your best friend. 5. At the altar as you get married. Everyone in attendance loves to see the husband-to-be get a little misty-eyed as his blushing bride walks down the aisle. 6. When your beloved car or truck, especially your first one, gets totaled. There\u2019s a bond between a man and his wheels that when severed, can really sting. 7. Visiting sites that pay tribute to those who laid down their lives for others. Whether running your fingers over the names at the Vietnam War Memorial or watching the oil leak from the sunk USS Arizona, contemplating the sacrifices made by your fellowman should make you tear up. 8. Describing a really spiritual experience. Feeling touched by a higher power can be really affecting. 9. As an athlete, after the final game/match/event that you will ever play in. You\u2019ll never be in as good shape again. You\u2019ll never experience this level of camaraderie again. You\u2019ll never push yourself so hard every day. Go on and let it out. 10.
