            "answer_text": "My favorite song on blonde is most definitely a variety. My personal favorite due to production would be \"Godspeed\", I love the swavy elastic guitar in the beginning. I also love how shifty and pure these reoccurring themes provide a church background feel to it all. and with frank, he really experimented with the primiszer effect (correct me if I'm wrong, my pronunciation on it). With \"Ivy\" I do feel like a child again revisiting his time of falling for someone so sudden and appearing backwards and slowly understanding how it feels, I love the repeating pure chords of the guitars, and that is what really makes me want to climb on my roof and light my pocket lighter on and raise it in the dark. he really didn't force ideas and sequences of this project, and that really makes me sink into this trainspotting moment in the album, he has themes that aren't hardly dignified to me, it felt all pure and harmony driven.

            "answer_text": "Blonde is easily one of my favorite albums from the last decade even if it has been released one year ago. Every track feels personal, sweet and emotional, just like teenage emotions. Even though one of the tracks that I totally fell in love with it is: \u201cPink + white\u201d. The track details memories of Frank\u2019s youth and of someone close to Frank who passed away. He remembers this person by experiencing his life through the lens of this person who is gone. The theme of mortality plays a key role in this Pharrell-produced track and in and of itself, the song questions Frank\u2019s outlook of his very own life. His detailing of a hurricane destroying everything in his path could also very well be an allusion to the wiping off of smiles on his face, and the replacement of them by misery to take its place because of the death that had caused this on someone he once loved. Apart from the deep meaning that the lyrics this track has, there is a sweet melody accompanied with Beyonc\u00e9 vocals that totally bring life to the song. In conclusion, \u201cPink + white\u201d is a masterpiece and one of my favorite songs. ",
