Why didn't Eddie quit when Jason Becker started or when Vai started playing with Dave? Why didn't Charlie Christian use distortion?A: Personal taste (If Chritstian had distortion his amp was probably messed up). Although all of those guys are different there is an audience for all of them and I like them all but I have to take Yngwie in small doses. He probably did use his version of sweep picking, except not as much as Yngwie. Almost all the guitar hero's have their go to tricks. Sweep arpeggios not necessarily being one of Eddie's. ",
