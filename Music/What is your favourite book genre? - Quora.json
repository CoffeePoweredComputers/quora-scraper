            "answer_text": "Thank you for visiting here; I read almost anything from the classics (I have read most of Dickens, Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice twice, Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and much more) to the trashiest thriller, self-help to physics, depending on my mood.Yesterday I reread Leave it to Cook by Stella Atterbury - not because I wanted to make any of the recipes, but because I wanted to extract the principles behind her method to adapt it to more modern tastes. Then I went and ordered her other good book, Never Too Late, which I had out of the library many years ago but which is now almost extinct. I shall regret this when my credit card bill comes in. I am also currently reading Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm by Stephen Harrod Buhner, but I keep having to go off at tangents to follow threads he introduces, look stuff up online or just allow what I have read to pass through my mental digestive system for a few days, so it is slow going. I am also reading Achieve the Impossible by Prof. Greg Whyte. This involves writing a lot of notes and practical application, so it is a slow read too, but I need to get all the help I can as I have an impossible project on at the moment. Indeed, I have just fallen down what he would describe as \u2018a pothole on the road to success\u2019 by overdoing it and cracking a rib. But I digress. For sheer pleasure I like reading thoughtful humour, sci-fi, slipstream, certain types of fantasy and some stuff which isn\u2019t very definable. Not all books fall neatly into a genre, or they mix them up, and this is true of some of the best. Sci-fi + Humour = Jodi Taylor, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams.Fantasy + Humour = Terry Pratchett, Robert Anton Wilson.Slipstream + Humour = L. Sprague De Camp ( I am thinking of Tales from Gavagan\u2019s Bar). Undefinable + Humour = Tom Robbins. Maybe it is fantasy, maybe it is spirituality, maybe it is slipstream, but all his work is great. Except Wild Ducks, that one is not fiction and it made me cringe.Some of my other favourite books are combinations of genres too: Drood, Ilium and Olympos by Dan Simmons are all historical novels with a strong fantasy element thrown in. So is Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut. The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul by Douglas Adams is sort of slipstream - realism with the unreal thrown in.There are two books by a little-known author called Hal Duncan: Vellum and Ink, that are a kind of alternate reality with mythology and horror. These are not an easy read, but worth the effort.However, the number one spot for my all-time favourite book is Douglas Adams\u2019 Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency. This is an astonishing creation. Having read it five times now, I can confidently say that I am unlikely ever to get to the bottom of it completely.it is literary fiction, a detective story, a ghost story, sci-fi of several different kinds (other worlds, alien invasion, time travel, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics), horror, historical fiction, a romance and more. It includes an explanation for human evolution. And the Interconnectedness of All Things. And a dead cat. And a horse in an upstairs BATHROOM.IT is like a piece of music by Bach, point and counterpoint, fugue and canon, but with words instead of notes. And it is funny. All written in Adams\u2019 seemingly wandering and careless style that appears to be going nowhere until you look back and see where you\u2019ve been. Only 309 pages. Amazing Hope it helps ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, L.M. Ash ! My favourite genre has changed a little over the years, but there are three that make up almost the entirety of my book collection. My number one, however: Fantasy. This is without a doubt my favourite fictional literature. It started (as it often does for fantasy readers) with Tolkien. The Hobbit was perhaps the first book I remember reading, and The Lord of the Rings soon followed it. I went through the obligatory Harry Potter phase as a teen (I still enjoy them somewhat, and am a proud Slytherin), but Tolkien has always transcended. In varsity, I was also introduced to George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series (Game of Thrones). More recently, I've also reacquainted myself with Raymond E Feist's books - Magician is the first of about 32 books set in Midkemia in episodic series - and Markus Heitz - The Dwarves. I've also started Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, and Terry Pratchett is next on my list. Less \u201cother worldly\u201d fantasy favourites for me are Beam Stoker's Dracula and Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. I suppose what attracts me most to fantasy novels is that (at least in the case of good fantasy) they're substantial. Most of those in my collection range from 500 pages upwards. But their content is equally substantial, especially when there's a fair amount of worldbuilding involved. In most cases, there's quite a lot of philosophy too (another of my top three genres, for that matter). But as a philologist, one of the things that is equally attractive to me as the substantial content is the philological content - the development of languages in a fantasy novel. While sci-fi also tends to offer some of this, it's never the same (and, for that matter, I'm yet to find a sci-fi novel with a story that I enjoy too). ",
