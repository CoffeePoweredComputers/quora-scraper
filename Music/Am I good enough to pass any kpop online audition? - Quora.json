            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re Asian, congratulations, you have the first step down. Now for the hard part. It depends on which company you\u2019re auditioning for. I\u2019m guessing you live overseas, so are automatically at a disadvantage. There are tons of Korean people that are vying to get into companies and audition daily, so you have to be really amazing at what you do, whether that be singing, dancing, or rapping. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re auditioning for a well-known company. (JYP, YG, SM, any company that debuts fairly popular artists). Since these companies have more money, they\u2019ll be more open to recruiting you, as it is more expensive to fund someone from a different country, but they\u2019ve done it tons of times before. (Except for YG). But, these are also the companies that people audition for the most and have hundreds of talented trainees, so you\u2019ll have to be truly incredible. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a native English speaker, so that\u2019s your advantage. If you audition for a small company that no one\u2019s ever heard of, you\u2019ll be more likely to get in due to the fact that there will be little to no people auditioning. But, they will not give in and fund someone easily. Again, you have to be amazing to make the scouts want to pay for you to move your entire life to Korea. Again, if you speak English fluently, the company will be more likely to hire you because you have something that the everyday Korean does not. Now let\u2019s talk about the actual audition. It is very hard to appeal to scouts online, because all you can send in is short videos of your talents and maybe a self description. You have to appear charismatic, attractive, and confident. The company will only hire you of they see idol potential. It does not matter if you\u2019re the best singer in the auditions, you have to radiate the aura that all idols seem to have. Do research about the companies. What style do they like? What do their idols look like? All companies have types. I wish you the best of luck with auditions! ",

If all of these apply to you then it is very very likely that most companies will accept you. But this can also just have to do with your timing. How good is the company financially? When did the company debut its last girl or boy group and when are they debuting there next? These are all factors to take in but if the all of the things first stated apple to you or at least all but one and the company is debuting a group in around a year then possibly. There is no telling for sure but of course there have been idols who have been accepted by multiple companies or trained at multiple. -A hungry potato ",
