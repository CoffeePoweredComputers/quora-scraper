The first two times, he said what he thought, they wanted to hear. They realized it the very moment, he gave an affirmative yes to the question does he think he's rehabilitated? To understand exactly what changed the third time we need to look at another scene in the movie where Brooks is paroled. Once Brooks was given the parole, he didn't want to take it. He wanted to go back and live the rest of the life in the Shawshank or as Red puts it, \"he was institutionalized\" or as I'll say \"he lost HOPE\".  The third time and they asked Red whether he thinks he's rehabilitated, his answer wasn't a Yes or a No. He replied what does that even mean. The kind of words he/she says when they lost all hope (They didn't approve the parole when he said yes, and saying No is definitely not going to work. He sees two options and he knows neither of them ever work). It's the kind of situation where it doesn't matter whether he's living inside the society or inside the walls. He has no hope left. He was institutionalized. He wanted to get it over with as soon as possible as this parole meeting is not there in his schedule every day and it's disturbing his schedule (institution). The parole officers also know only when someone is completely broken from inside, that's when they'll not be harmful to the society.  There are a few more scenes in the movie that hints at these points. Another prisoner saying to Red \"I\u2019m up for rejection next week.\u201d  Warden Norton's lines \"I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible\". Discipline here doesn't just mean to follow the rules and being punctual it also means to get institutionalized to Shawshank. If someone changes routine then the prisoners should feel at unease with it. That's what he's aiming for. But most important of all it's shown in the scene where Andy escapes after being in prison for 19 years, a year before parole hearing because he knew he'd never lose hope and he'd never be paroled. Or as Red says some birds aren't meant to be caged. And the parole officers would never release one with such bright feathers outside.  Andy : \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, no good thing ever dies\" (in context of Andy).  Edit: Got pics from Google and scoopwhoop. ",

            "answer_text": " Why did Ellis Redding have his first few parole requests rejected, in spite of saying everything the parole board wanted to hear, only to gain parole on his last attempt, despite showing contempt and sarcasm? Because the board could tell he really was sorry the last time he said so. \u201cEllis Boyd Redding. Your files say you\u2019ve served forty years of a life sentence. You feel you've been rehabilitated?\u201d (Parole Reviewer) \u201cRehabilitated. Well, now let me see. You know, I don\u2019t have any idea what that means.\u201d (Ellis \"Red\" Redding) \u201cWell, it means you're ready to rejoin society \u2014 \u201c \u201cI know what you think it means, sonny. To me, it's just a made-up word, a politician's word, so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?\u201d \u201cWell, are you?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a day goes by I don't feel regret \u2026 not because I'm in here or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then ... a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime ... I wanna to talk him \u2026 I wanna to try to talk some sense to him \u2026 tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and \u2026 this old man is all that's left \u2026 I gotta to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word \u2026 so you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.\u201d The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Within all of the deep sarcasm and contempt Red demonstrated for the judicial system was the resounding heartbreak of having wasted forty years of his life for making a tragic, stupid decision. It\u2019s one of the reasons we relate so closely to Red, I think. Because most of us know the regret of a long-term decision for which we can never go back and change, the results of which we have to live with for the rest of our lives, for better or worse. In that last parole hearing, Red revealed the deepest part of his soul, from which he had finally come to understand what were his truest regrets. It was an acceptance of having to pay with his life for taking three others, and for what amounted to no good reason. Because Red was in prison for having fixed the brakes on his wife\u2019s car to fail, after which she couldn\u2019t stop the vehicle running full speed down a hill, killing her, her neighbor, and her neighbor\u2019s child. For that, he got a life sentence to Shawshank Penitentiary. We might not have noticed the first time Red came up for parole after twenty years (the scene that opens the film) but Red didn\u2019t address the reason he was in Shawshank. He simply said what he thought the board wanted to hear. \u201cDo you feel you\u2019ve been rehabilitated?\u201d (Parole Reviewer) \u201cOh, yes, sir. Absolutely sir. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. I can honestly say I\u2019m a changed man. I\u2019m no longer a danger to society. That\u2019s God\u2019s honest truth.\u201d (Red) The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Not once did Red indicate why he was in Shawshank to begin with. It was a canned response, and it sounded canned. And the parole board saw right through it. Then, when Red came up for parole again, in his thirtieth year, he repeated, almost verbatim, what he had said at his first parole hearing. Again, he didn\u2019t address the actual crime, and again, he was rejected. The parole board had no reason to release Red on parole until he had accepted what he did as the awful crime it was, and for which he was responsible. And it wasn\u2019t until Red watched his friend, Andy Dufresne, gracefully shoulder, for twenty years, the false conviction of killing his own wife and her lover, that Red realized that he deserved to be in Shawshank. Andy didn\u2019t; but Red did. Yet, Andy never gave in to despair and Red saw how it was for an innocent man to conduct himself with dignity under the direst, most desperate of circumstances. And in their friendship, Red came to release his own long unrealized selflessness and regret. From Andy came Red\u2019s acceptance of his crime and his responsibility, out of which Red finally achieved his redemption. Red\u2019s moving scene to the parole board can be viewed here. ",
