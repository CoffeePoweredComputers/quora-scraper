            "answer_text": "     I assume you mean a tube amp rather than solid state electronics, but I will answer for both.  Weight and more tubes are a downside of larger tube amps but wattage is more complex.  As to the solid state, wattage won't matter as much since you can turn down a solid state amp and still get the best tones it can make although a higher wattage amp will be louder than a much lower wattage amp and can thus still be too loud for some situations especially practice at home.  As anybody has found out by playing a 100 watt tube Marshall at low level in a store, they sound awful.  They are made to be played literally maxed on every setting.  Tube amps tend to sound best when cranked due to the flattering effects of natural compression as well as more prevalent power tube distortion compared to preamp tube distortion at high volume as well as other complex issues associated with tube amplification.  For that reason, a 20 watt tube amp is likely loud enough for a small stage and almost too loud to practice cranked say in an apartment.  Needless to say, a 100 watt is quite a bit worse for anything other than a balls to the wall large gig, but do keep in mind that wattage is not linear and so 100 watts is not 5 times as loud as 20.  Probably 2-3 times as much at most.  You do gain a higher clean volume with most larger amps before they start to distort with the higher wattages, though.        I love small amps like the H&K Tubemeister at my office.  It is 18 watts and I can keep it turned up to maximum or near maximum while being just barely able to stay in the room- it is going into a 4X12 cabinet that could take up to 400 watts.  The 60 watt high gain B52 combo amp with a 1X12 I had before was much louder and sounded much worse because I couldn't crank it to get power tube distortion and still stay in the room.  Despite an amazing digital modeler into a real tube amp at home with a 40 watt combo, my 18 watt cranked is the only system where I can get an Eric Johnson lead tone that remotely matches his real tone-if I want to stay in the room without hearing damage.   That's what power tube distortion does for you, it's sexy.        A final consideration is the speaker cabinet.  Some people like having low wattage speakers overdriven for speaker distortion.  It's why some artists have used 100+ watt amps into enclosures with 30 watt speakers.  I haven't played with that as all of my speaker setups are high wattage.  This would be better with the high wattage amp, but I doubt this is really a major tone factor like power tube vs. preamp distortion or tube vs. solid state.  ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there is. The great benefit is that you can use all 100 of those watts to make your sound loud enough for the venue that you are playing. The other great advantage of high wattage amps is the tonal blend. In any amplifier, for every octave you go down in frequency, you need to double your power to get the same amount of volume from that lower frequency. You see this effect most in bass guitars, which are often playing two or more octaves below the guitar parts, and thus need four times the power or more to achieve the same kind of volume. But guitar parts can benefit from extra wattage as well. As a guitar signal is put through high wattage amplification, most of that power is used on the lower ranges of its sound. This gives the guitar a very solid and present low end response, something that less powerful amps just do not have the wattage available to do. The bigger question is \u201cDoes any of this really matter?\u201d, and here I must confess that the answer is not really. Time and technology have marched onward, and as PA systems got more affordable, guitar amplifiers didn\u2019t need to have 100 watts on tap to be heard over 3,000 screaming fans anymore. If you get your favorite guitar sound from a 20 Watt amp, you don\u2019t have to worry about being drowned out or not filling the room with sound. Just run your guitar amp through the PA, and suddenly your sound is as loud as you\u2019ll ever want it to be. ",
