            "answer_text": "I will try and point out the things that worked for me: Do this in the given order during the morning. If your time is finished say doing step 1 itself then don\u2019t go beyond. Repeat again the same next day until you can do it in lesser time. (Set your tanpura to G# so that your \u2018Sa\u2019 is G#) Ujjayi Pranayam - This is the best pranayam that cleans the throat and vocal chord, improves lung capacity for singing in addition to bringing in positive thinking, freshness and high level of concentration. Its better to do this first in the morning before beginning \u2018riyaaz\u2019. Do this initially for about 90 mins and later bringing it down to 30 mins.Humming from the nostrils: Its best to start off by humming the \u2018Sa\u2019 through the nostrils while keeping the mouth closed while playing \u2018tanpura\u2019 in the background. Don\u2019t exhale too fast while doing this. Do it slowly and try to create a constant clear sound. Do this initially for about 45 mins and later bring it down to 15 mins.Chanting Om: After the humming its best to chant \u2018Om\u2019 along with the tanpura. Do this for 30 mins initially and then bring it down to 10 mins.Sa ka riyaaz: This is the best riyaaz for the entire stretch of vocal chords. Play the tanpura in the background and sing the \u2018Sa\u2019 with the mouth open. Intake maximum possible breath and then don\u2019t forcefully exhale, just let the breath go out on its own while singing \u2018Sa\u2019. Try to maintain a constant pitch while exhaling the last breath out of the lungs. Ensure that the environment is not very cold and dry.Swara riyaaz: Start with \u2018Sa\u2019 then go to \u2018Ni\u2019 - one swara down, then \u2018Sa\u2019 again and then \u2018Re\u2019. Ensure you can distinctly sing the three notes clearly without distortion. Then add one more note down and up so there are total 5 notes to sing. Repeat these five until there is a distinct sound for all of them. Add one more not down and up and you have now 7 notes to sing, repeat the same and then add one more so you will have 9 notes to sing. Don\u2019t go beyond 9, just ensure you do this with clarity and you are done.Sa Sa - Ni - Sa - Re - Sa Sa - Ni - Dha - Ni - Sa - Re - Ga - Re - Sa Sa - Ni - Dha - Pa - Dha - Ni - Sa - Re - Ga - Ma - Ga - Re - Sa Sa - Ni - Dha - Pa - Ma - Pa - Dha - Ni - Sa - Re - Ga - Ma - Pa - Ma - Ga - Re - Sa What you shouldn\u2019t do is Forcefully singing a note that you can\u2019t singSinging high pitched songs when you know that you haven\u2019t developed that range.Shouting while singing to project your voiceSinging on a full stomachSinging Karaoke songs without first practicing on the harmonium",

            "answer_text": "You see, voice quality, (as the natural quality of vocal cords and resonators) is not the most cricual part in singing.  Here, I'd use a metaphor for explanation: there are bigger and smaller hands; there are hands with short fingers, and some have very long and thin fingers. But this doesn't really affect what you write and where you put commas. It can influence your manner of writing, the handscript a bit (however, it's highly dependent on your habits), but each manner is ok indeed if it's readable. It can be more or less readable, or it can take more or less space... You can sing different styles and a diversity of genres if it fits to your voice. If it doesn't, why would you consider changing the nature of your hand with a \"surgery\"? The same is true for singing: improving your voice is like improving your hand (I deliberately not touch the manners, but only the nature of the apparatus). Well, here are some suggestions: Don't smoke. Do never try.No alcohol. At least before singing. No beer at all. No soda water. No stark lemon, no seeds in big quantities.Talk less. Read more. No yelling, shouting, overindulgence partying, etc.Pay attention to your posture (try Alexander technique). Collapsed rib cage is one of the reasons for poor breathing.Study right breating.If you are a guy, ladies should be kept at a distance, at least before important events, for three days at least.If you make sports, great! But if you are tired while singing, your result would be the same as if you had an injured arm. No fanaticism in sports, please.Keep yourself in good mood. Sleep well.",

            "answer_text": "I am a classical singer and do not have a very strong voice. I, however have a good voice throw and can sing boldly at higher pitches. My problem is the base or lower octaves. What I do are1)Get up early in the morning and practice the lower octaves. The stronger your base voice gets , the better will be your clarity. Your voice will be fresh and basic at dawn. Hence you can have a better reach in the lower octaves. 2) It's also important that you do this regularly.3) If you are susceptible to whether changes then make sure you take proper care of your throat and voice. If your voice is good enough then you will still be able to pull through a musical performance like some of my friends do and they can do this because of regular practice .4) There's this ayurvedic medicine called \"kantil\" which most of musicians take to maintain voice texture. I tried it for some months and it was useful. It can get rid of soar throat for a while. Don'ts1) Dont eat/ drink cold stuffs often. Stick to food stuffs that are of moderate temperature.2) Dont overstrain your voice. If you cannot reach the higher octaves try to slowly expand your octave. Don't try to make it to the highest note at one go. Do it step by step.3) Shouting at top of your voice often, singing at pitches that are not suitable to you can stagnate your voice texture and clarity. Your voice improvement will not be significant. 4)  Find the pitch that is suitable for your voice. Improve your voice in that pitch. On an average a person can sing in 2.5 octaves. The maximum is 3 octaves.Hope you find this informative. These are the things I have been doing for a while and its really helping me to get a better tone. ",

            "answer_text": "The first word is S L O W L Y!  If you are looking to improve for your own enjoyment, then start with warming up your voice--doing scales slowly from the bottom of your range to the top and then the reverse.  These should be done quietly and smoothly.  Then practice vowel sounds in different keys. Drink plenty of water between exercises.  Then sing what you wish slowly working your way up to loud (but not bellowing). If you are hoping for a career, especially in classical music and you are at least in your late teens, find a teacher.  He/she will determine your vocal range and help you develop it.   A teacher will always have you warm up and correct any errors I made in the advice above. Whether classical or folk, the most important thing is that you enjoy what you are doing.  Music is a wonderful thing! Good luck ",

You can find various videos on breathing techniques on YouTube which can help you in singing. This will improve your tonality in the low range as well while exerting enough force on high notes. As mentioned by others, Practice is very important. But you need to decide your style of singing and then practice in that particular direction. There are countless singing styles and genres and practicing for every genre is different. You can get into the details as per your liking. But breathing, definitely is at the base of them all. ",

Practise octaves every now and then. Practise makes a man perfect. As the saying goes. 4. Avoid oily & spicy food. Spicy and oily stuffs will make microscopic linings in the inner walls of the throat, this will help your exhaling voice to escape and will make the singing sound like\u2026\u2026.i don't know\u2026.fart?

I would recommend finding someone who has a degree in voice studies and has experience in teaching new voices. If you experience anything you have questions about, always seek professional help.   ",
