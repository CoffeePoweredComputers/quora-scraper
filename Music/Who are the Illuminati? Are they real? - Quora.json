            "answer_text": "Power is power. It\u2019s all about power. Grabbing it, keeping it, using it. Power is their currency, their DNA, their god. They control the world. They provide th blue print and they give the instructions. They are right here hiding in plain sights, buying and selling favors. Blackmail, treason deceit, these are their stock in trade. They shake down demons and negotiate with sorcerers. They have stocks in hell and compromising photos of angels. They are the illuminati.  As far as secret organization go, the most well-known is probably the illuminati. Their rumored membership includes nearly every public figure in the world including Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, Pope, Barack Obama, Adolf Hitler and many more. This supposedly powerful cabal has been implicated in the Kennedy assassination, 9/11, the death of Michael Jackson and the ice bucket challenge and has been said to pulling the strings that make the world go round. So, what do we know about the Illuminati? The Illuminati is a cartel of international bankers, politicians, celebrities and businessmen, which seeks to control all aspects of life on earth: from current affairs to pop culture, and the governments. The Illuminati\u2019s goal is to establish a totalitarian government across the world and restrict our liberties. In 1776, a German philosopher called \u201cAdam Weishaupt\u201d set up a secret fraternity in Ingolstadt, which called the Bavarian Illuminati.  Adams group was radical alternatives to the freemasons, and supported many principles associated with the enlightenment era. The illuminati championed science and rational thought, gender equality and an end to state oppression. In fact, the word illuminati literally mean Enlightened in Latin. And the society used the ancient owl of Minerva as its symbol of wisdom. This symbol can still be found today in places like the white house, the emblem of America\u2019s elite club bohemian grove, and the US dollar bill if you look closely.  After some time, the illuminati, looking to expand their membership base, joined forces with the longstanding freemasons group. The freemasons were an intricate fraternal organization of laborer\u2019s; seemingly mysterious for their religious, like use of symbols and ceremonies. After securing their own free-mason lodge the higher order illuminati members attempted to recruit from the higher order freemasons. However, as a newer sect with different allegiances they commanded less respect than existing groups. Still despite significant infighting over the origins of various rituals, political and other petty differences the illuminati managed to recruit between 650 to 2500 members in Bavaria at their height around 1784. Around this time an obscure Christian cult, infiltrated the illuminati\u2019. They were very religious and opposed the idea of an enlightened scientific rational movement. After infighting further attacks by outside groups as well as too high a membership to keep the order secret, knowledge of the group got out. Many members were exposed and a number actually held high positions of power.  After being accused of publishing anti-religious literature, the Bavarian government banned all secret societies and seized and published a large number of important documents from the illuminati founders. This effectively ended the existence of the group. But many theorists believe that the illuminati went underground and never truly disappeared. Across the Atlantis, lot of Americas elites and politicians were already member of secret societies. If the illuminatis managed to survive today then they could be entrenched in our most established institutions. Conspiracy theorists point towards symbolism in Hollywood and the music industry as proof that this industry as proof that this omniscient fraternity is watching us. They believe that presence of pyramid symbol all-seeing eye and pentagram might indicate that famous artists are sent out a message or perhaps a cry for help, that the illuminati is treating the media as a powerful mind control weapon to brainwash the masses into submission. It\u2019s rumored that those who speak out against the establishment will be silenced. JFK, Tupac, Michael Jackson, are all thought to have assassinated by the illuminatis for disagreeing with its oppressive agenda. The appeal of the illuminati is its secrecy \u2013 we can never know for sure that it doesn\u2019t exist and that\u2019s what makes it so terrifying. ",

            "answer_text": "The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, \"enlightened\") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. In subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" refers to various organisations which claim or are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are often alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, films, television shows, comics, video games, and music videos. The Illuminati did not long survive their suppression in Bavaria, and their further mischief and plottings in the work of Barruel and Robison must be considered as the invention of the writers. However, writers such as Mark Dice, David Icke, Texe Marrs, J\u00fcri Lina and Morgan Gricar have argued that the Bavarian Illuminati have survived, possibly to this day. Many conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati. Presidents of the United States are a common target for such claims. Other theorists contend that a variety of historical events were orchestrated by the Illuminati, from the French Revolution, the Battle of Waterloo and the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, to an alleged communist plot to hasten the \"New World Order\" by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry. Some conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati observe Satanic rituals. ",
