            "answer_text": "Probably the greatest groove-anchored album ever made, the album hits a mellow funk pocket on its amazing title track and never lets up. Though the album is composed of nine tracks, and side two mixes up the formula a bit with Right On and Wholy Holy, in most ways the album feels like one long composition, and is, on a musical level, breathtaking start to finish, with multiple tracks - What\u2019s Goin\u2019 On, Mercy Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology), Inner City Blues - rating amongst the greatest soul recordings ever produced. My one knock on the album, and the only reason I feel it is more a top-25, top-50 all time record and not a top-ten all-time album as most contemporary aggregator cites have it, is that just like Stevie Wonder or U2 on occasion, when Gaye gets really earnest and political, the results can start to feel more naive and silly than significant or insightful. Case in point, Gayes repeated, almost hysterical cries to \u201cSave the babies\u201d on fourth track Save the Children, a short stretch that remains to this day one of the most unintentionally laughable moments ever put down on vinyl.

            "answer_text": "A bit overrated. Let\u2019s Get It On is a better album, but since the lyrical content of What\u2019s Going On is deeper, people have a tendency to overlook its flaws. I mean, it\u2019s not really \u201cenlightened\u201d to say you like the album about sex more than the \u201cserious\u201d one. But, you know, Let\u2019s Get It On is a more consistent album, with eighty quality songs. There are no duds. But What\u2019s Going On has a few duds. And something I can never get past when I listen to What\u2019s Going On \u2026 Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) is the same music as the title track! Almost exactly! ",
