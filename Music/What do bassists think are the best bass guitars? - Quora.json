            "answer_text": "As a bassist who's tried many basses, here's my take on it: Generally we buy the best bass we can, usually we spend about 50% more than we can afford on our main axe! So what's the best?  Well basses generally have a linear relationship between cost and quality.  The more you pay the better it is, whatever the brand.  Not all of us can afford an ugly-ass Fodera, I mean really, look at that giant cutaway; you can tell that some rich bugger's going to be going bippity bippity bop all over the top of the neck, probably doing chords and all sorts of fancy shit that bass players shouldn't get messed up in... ($5,000 up to over $30,000: you could buy a car or two for that!)  or a Pagelli  (mortgage your first-born child for one of these hand-made custom jobs)  but that's ok, because Fenders are great and reasonably priced, just under $1,000 and up, depending on the features it has.  I prefer the Jazz Bass,   although loads and loads of people like the Precision - to me it's too heavy, just a giant tree trunk with only one sound.  Still if you like that sound, it's a quality instrument you can have for a bit under $1,000   or if you have a bit more dosh, Rickys have a classic sound and to me, look great also, about $2,000 and up  Myself, I spent the big cash 30 years ago and got me one of these which is still awesome, but does, however, mark me as a child of the 80s...  well they don't make em anymore, but mine is a Steinberger L-2, made in Brooklyn NY, you can find them occasionally on e-Bay for about $3,000 to $4,000, which is good considering I paid about $1,600 in 1981!  Sounds solid, good low mid punch, and I've strung mine BEAD.  When you want to roar this thing sounds fat as fuck...  I now tend to stay away from Gibsons, although I had one of these Thunderbird things for years and never quite got the sound I wanted - it was always a bit thin and bonky - not a fair trade-off for a cool look imho, also the headstock kept breaking off...  Mine was a 1976 special model, you can still find these on e-Bay too, about $5,000 (I shoulda kept it! I only paid about $700 for it in 1979)  I played one of these Gibson things once: I thought it looked so cool, then I played it and it was horrid.  Sloppy feel (it's a short scale) , tinny sound, no guts at all, just horrendous.  Yet some people like them: It was called an EB (Electric Bass duh) -3, now they call them SG because of the style but that just means Standard Guitar (duh), but what a nasty thing it was. I'd never be able to use one.   Generally the first-line names are always reliable: Fender, Gibson (for some) Rickenbacker, Warwick, etc.Second place goes to things like Yamaha and Ibanez, which can be ok: you'll spend less than $1,000 but you'll likely moan about it quite a bit.  I don't think Fender Squiers are all they're cracked up to be - they just don't have the quality feel of a first-rate Fender. Other cheaper names: forget it, not worth wasting money on to me. But generally, the more you pay, the better it is. ",
