            "answer_text": "You mean ,Ajay Nagar? Right ? Do you really wanna know? Ok lets start:  This is milkyway, his home galaxy which is a infinite ocean of stars and he belong somewhere on the right side.  This is his solar system with his personal heater, Sun. We are neither too close nor too far from it which will surely not burn our ass.  Welcome home ! I live in the most beautiful planet of the milkyway which is mostly blue with the patches of green and the best thing is that i have no plans of leaving it and shifting to some yellow, red, orange coloured planet.  Do you see that red coloured area, thats his state, Uttar Pradesh which has more population than most of the countries of Europe.  Welcome to Heaven !  Thats the uncle in the bangals shop next to his house. Just ask for his name and then he will tell everything about his character, his college, his friends, his crush and at last his address.  If he is not at his house, then he will definitely be here, thats Z-square mall which is 4th largest mall in India. The reason he will be probably here is its distance from his house, that is 0.2 kms so he spend half of my time here and even security guards know him ! Now thats So you know where to find him. Let's hangout someday ? Tanmay Singh ",

            "answer_text": "There are mainly two platforms in which you can see Carryminati live. 1)You can see Carryminati live almost every day at night nearly 10pm in his gaming channel CarryisLive in which is he streams pubg, getting over it and many other games on PC and interacts with his fans or subscribers.  2) You can also see him live in his Instagram. His Instagram account is Ajey Nagar. But the time of Instagram live is not fixed but he announces it before some hours that he will be live.  Hope you have got your answer. Follow, upvote and feedbacks are highly appreciated. ",
