            "answer_text": "I'm going to list out everything here. After hearing the teaser and looking at the lyrics, I got mixed feelings. The song is darker than his other one's and is obviously far more personal. I don't want to assume anything, but it is only natural for me to worry. I have written some of my own songs before as well and you can't just materialize things. A song will always have a topic and a story. If you write the song, it's gonna have a very strong connection to you. Or at least in my experience. Taehyung\u2019s song is extremely dark and emotional, yet it sounds tender through his tone. I do think, the song is to convey his current feelings. And if not his alone, perhaps for idols as a whole. While being dark, I have a feeling in the way Taehyung had sung the song during his teaser, it'll be much more like a comfort and sentimental favorite, than known as a song for sadness. Now, as for us fans. I personally think it's fine if fans are a bit hung over the lyrics. After all, it's no surprise that many fans noticed the drastic change in Taehyungs behavior since end of last year. Fans at the time, thought it was due to the large amount of death threats and hate he had suddenly been getting. I do think that played a heavy role, but I don't know Taehyung personally, no fans really do, so we can't be sure. The evidence that Taehyung is \u201dnot okay\u201d is very hefty. During FESTA 2020, the members we're told to write letters to the other six. Meaning each member, got small messages from all the others. These letters we're released on Facebook for fans to see. Now, Taehyungs letter was what caught my attention the most. Why? Well, it's because all of his bandmates had wrote things conveying the message of \u201dYou can talk to us, \u201d or \u201dWere here for you. Please come to us if your struggling\u201d Jungkooks message was what really confirmed many things as he had wrote to Taehyung, \u201dI was getting worried because you've been quieter these few days, so I was very relieved when I saw you laughing and smiling during karaoke\u201d Kinda heartfelt yet concerning, huh? So, I whole heartedly thing that Taehyung is indeed going through something that is mentally affecting him. Through those letters, I can only assume that the others noticed and have been trying to help their second youngest. Disclaimers: I want to write the following because I think many fans\u2014both immature and mature\u2014 need to hear this: Taehyung and all other idols(boys and girls) are human. They have feelings. They laugh, they scream, they cry. But most of all the struggle. Idols are not robots. They are not invincible, just because they can manage tight schedules and dance 20+ sons with vocals never shaking off. Idols work hard because they love it on stage and with their fans. BUT the biggest point to takeaway is that Everything we see. Everything fans see about their idols are through cameras and screens. We don't know them.No matter how much we think we do, we don't.And YES, I agree that we may understand our idols work habits and personality, but at the same time we might not at all. Thank you for reading and let's support Taehyung and his mixtape, with lots and lots of love! Not concern! ",

            "answer_text": "The thing is, anytime an artist writes lyrics for their music they generally come from the experiences and feelings of the artist. It\u2019s not only a general idea to apply, but actually comes from Taehyung\u2019s own words.  Here he\u2019s talking about his song Scenery, however in many cases I\u2019ve seen Taehyung talk about how he always wants to express his feelings and emotions through his lyrics not only for himself but for ARMYs to understand him and feel what he feels. It\u2019s like he really tries to communicate with us through his music. I believe Taehyung is very honest about his emotions and he likes to share them with us. Of course, as an idol Taehyung hides a lot of stuff from us, however, I feel as though his emotions and feelings are something he\u2019s very transparent about and wants to write them for us. Taehyung enjoys writing lyrics about his feelings so that we can understand them and him as a whole. So my thoughts are that Taehyung is totally talking about how he really feels/has felt in the past with the spoiler we heard. An artist\u2019s music is a reflection of them, it\u2019s a piece of them and many of them use it as an outlet for them to help us understand and connect with them. So I feel as though the lyrics really do speak for how Taehyung feels since that\u2019s always been his goal with his music. Especially considering this is HIS mixtape, it\u2019s not like when he wrote for the Itaewon Class soundtrack and we got the masterpiece that is Sweet Night, but this is going to be a series of songs that completely encapsulate and reflect Kim Taehyung and who he is. I think it\u2019s okay for ARMYs to feel different ways about his lyrics, whether you get really worried or simply just enjoy his music or both, however, I would avoid making badless assumptions and such about his feelings or acting out in ways that don\u2019t have good reason. If you do get worried about him, don\u2019t go calling him depressed or something but rather send him all the love you can! Taehyung seems happy with his music, the boys and himself lately, so a lot of his lyrics may be older feelings he once felt or more so feelings he\u2019s since overcome, maybe feelings he only keeps somewhere in the back of his mind. Just remember to love and support him when KTH1 is released, I just know it\u2019s going to be amazing!  ",

He specifically said \u201cThe me of today is okay\u201d. THE ME OF TODAY. Maybe not yesterday. Also in inner child, \u201cthe thorns in the budding rose\u201d. This probably signifies pain or sadness. I think Inner Child was about his past and growth and what he\u2019s learned. So I think that maybe now that he\u2019s gone through hard times, he feels open to talk about them in his songs now that he\u2019s better. This is mostly what I believe and it\u2019s what I want to believe because I don\u2019t want him to be sad. But I still worry. Regardless of what he\u2019s currently feeling, let\u2019s keep supporting him and giving him all our love. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c ",
