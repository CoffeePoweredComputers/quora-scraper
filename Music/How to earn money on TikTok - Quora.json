            "answer_text": " Great question! As TikTok grows in popularity many people are finding ways to effectively profit from their accounts. Here are a few ways you can do it: Use TikTok as a Promotional Outlet If you already happen to be an influencer, or you\u2019re already popular on other social media, you can use TikTok to tap into an audience you may not be reaching yet. TikTok has a much younger audience that you may not be interacting with yet. It\u2019s a great way to create more content in the most popular types of videos being made today. You can use your new-found audience to direct traffic to your YouTube channel or something similar, to increase your ad-revenue. Many TikTokers will upload their videos to Instagram as well, to reach their audience that may not be on the TikTok platform yet. Just search #TikTok on Instagram to see how other creators are taking advantage of this. Get Sponsors Once you\u2019ve obtained a decent sized following on TikTok, you can get sponsorships. Make sure that your twitter account has a business email displayed for potential sponsors to contact you. You can also work with a manager to hook you up with more sponsors. The sponsors will pay you to promote their product on your social media platforms. This is a source on income for most of the major influencers. Sell Merch If you have a large audience, you might want to consider selling merch in the form of shirts, hoodies, ect. This is another very popular form of income for many of the top TikTok stars. There are lots of different merch companies that you can work with to create clothing for your fans. Live.ly Using the Live.ly app, you can livestream directly to your TikTok audience. When streaming, your fans have to option to send you tips, similar to how Twitch streamers make their money. This is the best way to make money, for those of you that don\u2019t have a massive audience yet. Even with a small amount of viewers it\u2019s possible to get donations during a livestream. Ad Revenue As of right now, TikTok does not have an ad revenue system. If you\u2019ve used YouTube and Twitch, you\u2019re probably familiar with how you can earn a portion of the ad revenue from your channel. TikTok doesn\u2019t have any ads on their platform yet, but they\u2019re working on implementing that soon. This means there\u2019s a possibility that TikTokers could earn money from ads on their channels.

            "answer_text": " Growing Your TikTok AccountTikTok is still relatively new, even when you allow for its previous life as muscial. Therefore, people are still discovering the best ways to succeed on the platform. Ironically, one of the most successful methods is to work TikTok, along with another network. Some of the top TikTok influencers also perform exceptionally well on YouTube, with \u201cBest of TikTok\u201d type compilations \u2013 and they manage to take advantage of YouTube\u2019s established advertising system. Understand Your AudienceYou need to begin by asking why people would want to follow you. What do you offer that thousands of other accounts don\u2019t? Is it entertainment? Are you a good singer, musician, dancer, or stand-up comedian? Are you so bad at those things that you can make your videos funny? Can you create entertaining prank videos? Can you motivate people or provide them with helpful hints to improve their lives? Or are you merely yet another lip-syncher who doesn\u2019t add any value to your video clips? This also helps you better know your audience. You\u2019re not making videos for yourself. Nor should you make a wide range of videos trying to keep everybody happy. Successful TikTokers make videos that they know their audience will love. It is much easier to devote your attention to a particular group of people, rather than just making random content. Perfect Your ProfileOne of the most essential sections of TikTok is your profile. This is your \u201cpage\u201d where you can establish your identity. You want your profile to appear attractive to your intended audience. Your profile needs to highlight your identity as a creator. It needs to show your intended audience why they should subscribe to your page. Your profile will be where you make your first impression to many people, so you want it to stand out from the crowd. If you are beginning from scratch, you have the chance to create the perfect username. You want it to be easy for people to say and spell, and preferably relevant to you and your niche. Ideally, you should have the same username on all your social profiles, so your TikTok fans will know when they have found your YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram channels. The type of videos you intend to share should be obvious to anybody looking at your profile. Be careful, though, particularly if you are a typical young TikToker. Some creeps misuse TikTok. Don\u2019t give away too much personal information on your profile, or upload image/videos that dodgy people may abuse. For this reason, you should ensure that nothing in the background of your images/videos give too much information about where you live. Follow the Basic Rules and Conventions When Uploading VideosThere are certain expectations of TikTokers when they upload videos. For a start, you need to ensure you don\u2019t breach TikTok\u2019s content guidelines. There should be nothing inappropriate in your videos; no hate speech, racism, etc. Remember that some adults do misuse TikTok, so be careful when uploading videos of yourself doing perfectly normal everyday activities that creeps might abuse (e.g., is it really a good idea to upload videos of you and your friends in nighties at a slumber party?) Remember that TikTok is a public social network. Anybody can view your videos. Like Snapchat and IGTV, the convention on TikTok is to upload vertical videos. The ideal aspect ratio is 1080x1920. Write a suitable description of each video and include relevant hashtags. Pick an exciting thumbnail image for each video. Make sure you pick the most appropriate categories for your videos. Produce Consistent ContentYou will also want to set up a consistent pattern so that your audience knows what to expect. There\u2019s little point in being a \u201cone hit wonder.\u201d If people know to expect a specific type of video for you each Tuesday and Friday, they will begin to expect it and return to TikTok on those days to watch your latest video. They are also more likely to tell their friends about you, widening your audience further. You might consider adding short \u201cslice of life\u201d-type videos between your main videos. This helps your audience know and understand you better. Alternatively, you might make Vlogs alongside your more niche-specific ones. Ideally, you want all your niche-themed videos to have the same look and feel about them \u2013 you want to create your own style. This is true even if you are simply making lip-sync videos. Quite a few of the top TikTokers began making lip-synch videos, but the types of songs they chose, and the way they made the videos made them identifiably theirs. If you\u2019re uploading non-music videos, you want them to tell a story in your voice and style. You could have similar segments in each video or similarly shoot each video. Engage with Your AudienceDon\u2019t forget to interact with your viewers. Make sure that you reply to comments that people leave on your videos. It may seem like hard work to you, but it makes your followers believe you care and take notice of them. Consider going live at times, interacting with your fans as you stream. Share the parts of your life you are happy to divulge to them. The more they believe they know you, the better they will feel about you and your videos. Performing live music may be challenging, but your fans will love it if you feel comfortable doing that. Otherwise, use your live sessions to discuss topics of interest to your fans, run Q&A session, and possibly have guests on your video. Promote Your TikTok Videos on Your Other Social ChannelsPromote your videos on your other social channels, and your blog, too, if you have one. The more people who know about your content, the more will watch and like it. The more you promote your content, the more additional followers you are likely to gain, and the closer you will be to being considered an influencer. Improve Your Production Values Over TimeMost people begin on TikTok with a limited budget, equipment, and skills. Over time, you should be able to develop your skills, and hopefully, once you can generate money, you can improve your budget and equipment as well. The key to success on TikTok is to produce high-quality videos. You should spend time learning the skills of successful film making. Try to make each video better than the last one. Earning Money on TikTokUntil TikTok\u2019s advertising network develops further, the easiest way for TikTok influencers to earn money is by making direct arrangements with brands. As people become better known on the platform, they will begin to have brands approach them with business propositions. Once you count your followers in the thousands, you can start to look at monetizing TikTok. Companies have been known to pay $200 to $20,000 per branded video promoted by influencers, depending on the individual\u2019s level of influence. Some of the ways influencers can earn money on TikTok include: Promoting brands in your videos (just like any other form of influencer marketing), either directly or more indirectly (like an unboxing video or simply by wearing a fashion label\u2019s clothes in your videos)Cross-promoting your promotions on your other platforms, e.g., if you make a good income from YouTube you can use your TikTok channel to bring people over to your YouTube channelUsing your TikTok videos to promote items you\u2019re selling somewhereCreating live videos and receiving tips from your viewers (formerly called Live, but now called Go Live).",

            "answer_text": "On YouTube, you get money from the views you get, but on TikTok you don\u2019t get money from views right now,\u201d Javi Luna, a TikTok creator with 4 million followers, told the BBC For the most part, TikTok doesn\u2019t offer creators a way to make money on its platform. Creators can secure sponsorships and brand deals for individual posts, but those deals have to be secured without TikTok\u2019s help. A select group of creators hand-picked by TikTok can also earn money through tipping in live streams, but that doesn\u2019t cover the most popular part of the app. This lack of monetization options could make it harder for TikTok to get its top talent to stick around, and it\u2019s already led popular creators, like 3 and 4 million follower, to direct fans to their YouTube accounts. After all, that\u2019s where they can earn money far more easily. There are ads on TikTok right now, but none run directly on creators\u2019 videos and offer a cut of the money, like on YouTube. Monetization on TikTok is difficult because videos don\u2019t run longer than 60 seconds, and putting a lengthy ad in front of them would ruin the fast-paced experience. The company is \u201cexploring a variety of opportunities to create value for our brand partners, with our main focus being on creating a great experience for our community,\u201d a TikTok representative told The Verge. The representative did not mention whether a program like AdSense would ever come to TikTok. \u201cTikTok is a platform for creative, fun, and positive experiences,\u201d the representative said. \u201cThe brands we see having the most success are those that embrace the creativity and authenticity of the TikTok community.\u201d \u201cIT\u2019S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR THE SYSTEM TO REALLY BE THERE.\u201d Right now, TikTokers (as they refer to themselves) are still relying on alternative ways of making money like tipping and brand deals. Discussions between people in the industry strongly suggest that TikTok will support native advertising on the platform as an effort to retain creators, according to Jacob Pace, CEO of the content firm Flighthouse. Direct monetization for creators is important to keeping them on the app, Pace said, and TikTok executives know this. There\u2019s a never-ending battle over where top creators land, and being able to financially compensate people is at the center of that fight. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while for the system to really be there,\u201d Pace argued. \u201cAs someone who has channels on TikTok, and works with creators, we all want to monetize, and I think they absolutely will.\u201d As goofy videos turn into careers, monetization goes from being an added bonus to a necessity. It\u2019s why YouTube is still the golden standard for creators earning money, followed closely by Twitch and Facebook. Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube allow creators to earn money directly from ad revenue, while the latter two options also allow people to earn ongoing payments via subscription models. YouTube and Facebook take a 45 percent cut of revenue from videos, giving creators 55 percent; Twitch takes 50 percent for most creators. P Please up vote me ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays. Tiktok is a famous video site. if you want to earn on TikTok then follow on my tips. Strategy 1: Live Streaming  Arranged mostly around melodic execution (regardless of whether lip-matching up or live), live streaming on TikTok used to happen through from that point forward. The genuine trade rates change with time, however, the essential framework is straightforward: TikTok clients can buy \"coins\" utilizing real cash by means of in-application buys. They would then be able to utilize their coins (and other subsidiary in-application monetary forms) to tip TikTok makers, fundamentally giving them a limited quantity of genuine cash as a thank-you for making some great live substance. TikTok passes 80% of the value of the tip on to the individual doing the live stream, constructing their record (and not by chance, motioning to brands that this individual is really developing in impact.) It's not commonly a fortune, yet it very well may be a salary stream, in spite of the fact that you need to take the cash as computerized endowments as opposed to money; it's not very difficult to transform that into cold hard cash, in any case. Strategy 2: Promoting/Selling Your Own Ventures This is likely the most reasonable route for a great many people to bring in cash by means of TikTok, even without amassing a tremendous after and turning into a national-scale influencer. The mystery is to have some other line of business or store, and use TikTok as a completely free approach to advance and sell your products or administrations, or to advance your current business. Interestingly, this can be just about any (lawful) business or administration, regardless of whether it's geeky, tricky, nerd, or simply insane. For instance, you may have a waterway boating administration that brings individuals on pontoon trips down the Colorado River each mid-year. All things considered, you can take recordings of each pontoon trip you make, and make 15-second clasps indicating how much mind-boggling fun individuals are having. Post that on TikTok, alongside some limited time outlines demonstrating where you are, the way to connect with you, what you charge, and when your next excursion is, and you can discover your appointments topping off like enchantment. TikTok isn't legitimately paying you for anything, however, your business is currently making a huge number of dollars on the referrals and new clients that you're pulling in with your recordings. (Furthermore, obviously, you can likewise put the recordings on your Facebook page, your YouTube channel, and so on.) Another model is somebody who has a specialties business \u2013 the state you make cool glass figures with liquefied glass. You can make super-quick How-I-Do-It recordings demonstrating your strategies (and how great you are busy, featuring your best and most lovely work) and calmly notice that you additionally sell these figures by means of your site, which you at that point give a connect to. Not exclusively do the how-to recordings draw in individuals who like your work, however, you likewise can legitimately sell products directly from your recordings, and rather than you paying for the transfer speed, TikTok covers it for you. At long last, you can, fundamentally, publicize any business regardless of whether it isn't something that makes an interpretation of well to video. By setting up a video that is fun, entertaining, imaginative, or musically extraordinary, you'll stand out \u2013 and afterward, you can have a couple of casings toward the end pitching your product or administration.

            "answer_text": "The video sharing TikTok app has made enormous strides in popularity since its release for Android and iOS in 2017. In their own words, \u201cTok is the world\u2019s leading destination for short-form mobile videos.\u201d The idea behind TikTok is for people to be able to quickly and easily create short videos using their smartphones, enabling everyone to be a media creator. As of July 2019, there are more than 500 million active monthly users of the app, making it a leading contender in the video creation with pretty much every Internet-based trend that comes along, the question quickly arose with TikTok: can you make money on this thing? The answer is that yes, you certainly can. While TikTok is not built specifically around monetization and providing income streams to creators, the app is very commercial-friendly and it is possible to earn a good living by creatively using the platform. As of this writing (July 2019) TikTok does not share ad revenue with creators, but there are imminent rumbles that this is going to change, and that the app will take a more YouTube-like approach, allowing successful creators to directly earn revenue from their videos. In this article, I will discuss the basic ways in which one can make money on TikTok. Please note that there is no \u201cmagical formula\u201d or get-rich-quick scheme; there isn\u2019t a secret technique that lets you post a TikTok video every day and in a month retire to your Tuscan villa to ride around on speedboats in the Mediterranean. If there was, I\u2019d be using it, not telling you about it. Rather, I\u2019m going to talk about the basics and give you some suggestions for how to think about monetization of the platform, so that you can decide how to proceed. Making money on TikTok is like making money anywhere else \u2013 it requires work, creativitity, some luck, and \u2013 most critically \u2013 on creating value so that other people want to be part of what you\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t create value, you don\u2019t make money. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an answer I had to a similar question recently: TikTok has grown quite a bit in the past year and that means more money for influencers as more brands are willing to partner with influencers on the platform. While there\u2019s no equivalent YouTube partner program on TikTok (YouTube shares ad revenue), you can still make quite a bit of money if you know how to monetize your audience on TikTok. Top TikTok users have millions of followers and can make millions of dollars per year. Here are some ways to do so: Brand deals. Now that TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world, advertisers are willing to pay a hefty amount to showcase their brand to a primarily young audience. Back in 2014, brands were paying $20k-50k for brand deals on Vine (https://www.complex.com/pop-cult...). That\u2019s 2014\u2026 when companies didn\u2019t have huge social media influencer budgets. That\u2019s not the case anymore, brand deals for top TikTok influencers would range in the $50k\u2013150k range if not more depending on the number of views they can get. There\u2019s a lot more money in the space than there was in 2014 so deals are also much easier to come by.Selling your own stuff. You probably are no stranger to merch (tshirts, pants, etc. ) being sold to you on YouTube or other social media platforms. The same can be done on TikTok and across all platforms has been shown to make about the same if not more money than ads would make you.Cross promoting your other social media accounts. Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter\u2026 The most popular TikTok influencers really build large audiences across all other platforms not only to diversify just in case TikTok dies, but also because more people looking will be looking at your content which equals more money.",

            "answer_text": "If you want tiktok's way of making money, you must first know the genes of this company. This is a Chinese company. Titiok actually has a Chinese name called douyin\uff08\u6296\u97f3\uff09. After the great success in China, douyin copied his business model to the world and began to succeed. Users in China have made a lot of profitable ways of douyin\uff08\u6296\u97f3\uff09. 2017-2018 is the prime time for these players. They earned a lot of money, and now tiktok is in such a bonus period. As far as I know, the method of making money by douyin is divided into 3 kinds. The first way is to take some very attractive product videos and then direct traffic to the shopping mall. This is a very profitable and simple way. Some products are naturally suitable for platforms like tiktok for drainage, and the Conversion rate is very high, these products are characterized by novelty, or product sales in the plot. However, for most individual players, they can bring huge profits through simple product demonstrations. You can find a lot of products in China's douyin app.I think this method should be the best fit for this problem, because it is done by the Chinese, it can be copied directly and then to make money. There are also some people who choose to become influencer, but most of the influencer of the short video platform can't compare with the platform like youtube. The fan loyalty is very low, but they can still make ads to make money. The third is the most profitable gameplay. Large merchants sell their products by advertising Through the official advertisements or cooperate with influencer, the quality of advertisements for such products is usually high and the conversion rate is high, and advertising costs are relatively low compared to Traditional social media search engine advertising. During the whole period of 2018-2019, the return on investment ratio is very high. Now tiktok is working Try to open a shopping cart, then it will go the same way as it did on douyin. I am from China, What I want to tell you is that the started to cause a myth of making money in China two years ago, and it is now your turn.. I hope that my experience of douyin have helped you understand how to make profit on tiktok.welcome to pm me. Please forgive me for not being able to read my words. I translated it with Google translate, haha. ",

            "answer_text": "Growing accounts and selling them The first way people are making money from Tik Tok is growing accounts and then selling them.This is becoming more and more popular in the eCommerce or product space.Similar to Instagram, you\u2019re going to choose a niche and then go ahead and create entertaining content, ideally content that goes viral to attract that person who would be the ideal customer for your product. There are already people in this space today who are growing TikTok profiles around a certain interest. Usually it\u2019s a niche topic and they might not have anything to sell, but they\u2019re going to reach out to brands in that industry and sell their TikTok profile to them and people are legit making money this way. The good news for product brands is once they have that account in their hands, it\u2019s actually fairly easy to sell products. One way that people are selling products is through TikTok Live. They are launching products while livestreaming or they\u2019re actually holding auctions while live streaming. #2: Donations The second way people are making money from TikTok is going Live and collecting donations from viewers (just like you can do on other platforms, like Twitch). I find this feature of TikTok fascinating. It\u2019s really a built in monetization platform, literally from day one. From what I\u2019ve seen, here\u2019s how it works: When you\u2019re a TikTok user, you can go into your profile and purchase something called coins. For a hundred coins it will cost you $1.39. Now what do you do with these coins? When one of your favorite creators is going Live, you can actually send them coins as a way of giving thanks for all of their effort in creating the content they do. What does the creator do with this coin? The creator turns the coins into diamonds and those diamonds can be converted into cash via PayPal. Cool, right? #3: Manage influencer campaigns The third way to make money from TikTok is to manage influencer campaigns. This isn\u2019t a new idea. There are straight up influencer agencies to serve Instagram influencers already. The same concept applies to TikTok. You can be the middleman or the broker between a creator on TikTok and a brand who wants to work with that influencer. From creating the agreement, managing both parties, making sure the deliverables are all met \u2013 just being a coordinator \u2013 you can charge a service fee to manage campaigns like that. #4: Tiktok ads platform The fourth way you can make money from TikTok is by using their ads platform Just like Facebook ads, you can Google right now, \u201cTikTok ads\u201d and sign up for access to their ads platform. It is pretty self-explanatory if you\u2019ve ever run paid traffic before, so if your market\u2019s on TikTok, it might be worth you creating a few ads, putting some budget toward experimenting there and seeing what happens. Maybe you can sell more of your products through TikTok! #5: Management services The fifth way you can make money from TikTok is by offering management services for creators on the app. Some creators on TikTok have millions of followers and sometimes this happens really fast and overnight for that creator. It\u2019s like having a business land in their lap. You could step in and offer services to help them with their content strategy, their creative strategy, maybe managing offers and deals that come their way. So if you have that background in production or storytelling, you could definitely apply that to offering management services to TikTok creators. #6: Consulting Last but not least, once you become a pro on TikTok, and maybe you really understand how someone could take a video that maybe gets a hundred views and help them get 100,000 views, well, you can simply offer consulting services. This is a really great way to leverage your expertise from the platform and help people who want to be TikTok famous or they want to be creators, actually boost their strategy so their videos get seen by hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. Of course, you need to have the background and the experience in this first to offer this as a service. But once you\u2019re there, people will pay to have your experience and your brain on their account. Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, In my opinion Earning money on Tik Tok are as follows Donations/ GiftsA TikTok user can easily go live and directly interact by commenting and chatting with thousands of users. The viewers have the capability of donating coins, a virtual currency that everyone within the app can purchase with fingerprint ID or facial recognition. Coins purchased by users can subsequently be donated to the influencer during the live session. 2. Influence Marketing Influencers can promote products or services to their followers and be compensated by a company. TikTok users can create one or multiple short clips in their own style to promote a company\u2019s product(s). It can be comedic, entertaining or informative based on the influencer\u2019s audience and choices. The compensation varies on factors such as the number of followers, engagement rate, types of products or services promoted, number of videos produced, industry and Geo-location. Keep in mind that users, especially on TikTok, prefer funny and entertaining videos instead of a direct advertisement. Another factor is to make sure the activation can become easily viral in order to be featured on the \"For You\" page and gain even more organic exposure. 3. Merchandising Another way content creators and influencers can gain additional profit on TikTok is by designing and selling their own merchandise (clothing lines are yet considered the most profitable). In order to gain the maximum profit, it is necessary for an influencer to have a large following and a sense of community. 4. Events And Brand Partnerships Lastly, another way influencers can make money through TikTok is to be invited by brands and companies as a special guest to participate in events, music festivals or conferences where the TikTok user will be paid to promote a brand, perform on stage (dancing or singing) or meet with followers. TikTok is a fairly new social media platform that is growing fast not only in China but also in the United States and Europe. Both brands and users can benefit from a business point of view. It is the right moment to jump on TikTok for business purposes before it becomes saturated and more expensive as an acquisition channel. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. I\u2019m going to pop one bubble right now and say that the TikTok creator fund is a terrible way to earn money. I tested it in this video and was unimpressed. Very few creators are making enough from this to make a living. In fact, Bella Poarch, the most viral video creator ever on TikTok has likely made less than $100,000 total from the platform. So how? Merch Many of the top creators create merchandise stores using softwares like Printify that can print on demand shirts and other swag. They put a link in their profile like mine down below, then tell people to click the link to purchase in videos.  YouTube This is a strategy I started testing and it is doing much better. YouTube pays significantly more per view than TikTok does. This means you can make a YouTube video, then make a TikTok version of that video. Upload the TikTok, then send the user to YouTube to watch the full video. You will make significantly more (nearly $1,500 in a single month for me) by doing it this way. Affiliate Marketing This is the process of finding companies that will let you promote their products, and will pay you to do so. You can get a better overview here. You sign up to promote a company, they give you a special link, and then they pay you each time someone clicks your link and buys. Sponsorships We\u2019ve all watched a video that says \u201cthis message is sponsored by xyz\u201d. Companies will pay creators to talk about them or make videos about them. Some companies will pay tens of thousands of dollars to get their products in front of the right audience. ",

            "answer_text": "TikTok has exploded in popularity. The amount of eyes on this platform is insane. More influencers are jumping on and adding to the total count. This platform is the perfect storm for anyone to ethically exploit if you know how to. Here\u2019s one way: Sending Traffic To Your Authority Locations When you start getting traffic to your TikTok you can include your website or post ads within the app. Since the app is growing so fast there is a massive population of people who will be interested due to sheer numbers. You can take advantage and narrow the traffic even further by adding your personality within your post. The more people that are present and willing to listen to your content the more opportunity you\u2019ll encounter; you can grow your business and grow your personal brand. Once your traffic is sent to your authority locations then you can do the follow up, give the lead magnet and build your relationship.  Another method: Brand Deals With Different Social Media Platforms You can take your brand deal to new heights by utilizing other free content you post on your social media. People on average have around 4 different social media apps on their phone which they use regularly. TikTok Is among one of those 4 now in 2019. But then how will you make money with TikTok if you are on different social media? The reason is that not everyone is going to buy from you just from TikTok. A good percentage will only buy through you on one platform. So if you\u2019re only on TikTok then you\u2019ll be leaving a ton of money on the table. Now if you told that same audience that you also have a Youtube, Snapchat, Instagram. Then you\u2019ll be able to monetize the rest of your audience. Since percentages will only buy items exclusively from your Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat. So make content for all these platforms and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making huge profit figures because you\u2019re leveraging all the tools at your disposal.  The final method: Selling Your Own Items On Your Site Don\u2019t settle for just making money from ads or from your other social media. Make a huge following and build a long term relationship. To start promoting your merchandise! This merchandise is one of the fastest ways to get your audience even more connected to you. And to keep you coming back. The reason selling your own products works is due to the unique feeling only you can share with them. That feeling is to be part of a community. A community where they feel that there are many other like minded people who have something they can share with one another. That does not come easy but that\u2019s part of the process to making big movements happen. They take time but when they happen they are massively powerful. Get a tool that will give you an opportunity to make an affordable but still advanced authority site for yourself. Do yourself a favor with this tool I\u2019ve been using. If you want to also see an estiamtion of how much revenue you\u2019re getting from your multiple social media accounts. Then socialblade will help take care of that for you. This is a stream of income you could set up now! I recommend you go out and put it to the test! \u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f =========> Stefano Cabezudo-Limongi If you share and upvote this, You\u2019ll bring me closer to success!  ",

            "answer_text": "The youngsters who use tik tok can buy virtual coins \u2013 100 coins for $0.99. When viewers like a particular performance on tik tok they can use their virtual coins to buy emoji which pop up on the screen during a live performance. These emoji come at a range of prices, from five cents for a panda head up to $50 for a blue creature with a halo, wearing a pink dress. The more somebody is prepared to gift the performer the more prominent their name displays on the screen for everybody to see. The better performers encourage their followers to support them. They give a shout out to their more generous fans. This appeals to the youngsters who watch these videos. They love the public praise they receive if they make a significant enough donation. Plus there will always be the collectors, who deliberately aim to buy one of each available emoji. The shout-outs can generate even more than the virtual emoji gifts can. Viewers quite often buy their stars gifts, just so they can hear their heroes shout-out their name. The more organized musers include honors boards on their pages showing everybody who their top contributors are. To the hip youngsters of Generation Z, this is a form of a pay-to-play system. They are happy to pay their virtual dollars (using real cash of course,), to be part of the experience. The nearest their parents got to public recognition like this came with old-style telethons, where you saw your name flash across the screen if you made a significant enough donation. Today\u2019s youngsters can see their name instantly appear in their \u201cprograms,\u201d and can even chat with their heroes. ",

            "answer_text": "Tiktok is by any means the fastest growing social media platform right now.  In a world filled with problems, TikTok acts as a platform where you, a content creator, can both enjoy and make loads of money out of it. Here are the best 6 ways of doing so: #1: Growing accounts and selling them The first way people are making money from Tik Tok is growing accounts and then selling them. Similar to Instagram, you\u2019re going to choose a niche and then go ahead and create entertaining content, ideally content that goes viral to attract that person who would be the ideal customer for your product. There are already people in this space today who are growing TikTok profiles around a certain interest. Usually it\u2019s a niche topic and they might not have anything to sell, but they\u2019re going to reach out to brands in that industry and sell their TikTok profile to them and people are legit making money this way. The good news for product brands is once they have that account in their hands, it\u2019s actually fairly easy to sell products. One way that people are selling products is through TikTok Live. They are launching products while livestreaming or they\u2019re actually holding auctions while live streaming. And, of course, there is the link in the bio where you can always drive your followers to purchase your product. So if you\u2019re the type of person to love TikTok, and you just want to grow a following around a certain topic and build that community around a certain topic, go for it and then reach out to those brands who would love to have access to those followers and sell them your account. #2: Donations The second way people are making money from TikTok is going Live and collecting donations from viewers (just like you can do on other platforms, like Twitch). It\u2019s really a built in monetization platform, literally from day one. From what I\u2019ve seen, here\u2019s how it works: When you\u2019re a TikTok user, you can go into your profile and purchase something called coins. For a hundred coins it will cost you $1.39. Now what do you do with these coins? When one of your favorite creators is going Live, you can actually send them coins as a way of giving thanks for all of their effort in creating the content they do. What does the creator do with this coin? The creator turns the coins into diamonds and those diamonds can be converted into cash via PayPal. Cool, right? On the Chinese version of TikTok \u2013 an app called Douyin \u2013 there is a next-level feature similar to this. When creators are Live, they can actually attach a shopping cart to a product they sell. So it\u2019s kinda like QVC or the shopping channel. You can go Live, hold an auction, and people can buy your product while you\u2019re Live through the shopping cart feature. My guess is this feature is going to come to accounts worldwide sooner rather than later. #3: Manage influencer campaigns The third way to make money from TikTok is to manage influencer campaigns. This isn\u2019t a new idea. There are straight up influencer agencies to serve Instagram influencers already. The same concept applies to TikTok. You can be the middleman or the broker between a creator on TikTok and a brand who wants to work with that influencer. From creating the agreement, managing both parties, making sure the deliverables are all met \u2013 just being a coordinator \u2013 you can charge a service fee to manage campaigns like that. TikTok as a platform is smart; they actually have an internal influencer program already built in. So if I\u2019m a big brand and I want to reach out to TikTok and say, Hey, this is the space I\u2019m in, what influencers should I work with? I can do that. The only thing is, I\u2019m going to pay a percentage to TikTok for brokering that agreement. That\u2019s where you can come in as a service or agency to make that agreement outside of TikTok and help brands save a little bit of money. #4: Tiktok ads platform The fourth way you can make money from TikTok is by using their ads platform. Just like Facebook and Instagram ads, you can Google right now, \u201cTikTok ads\u201d and sign up for access to their ads platform. It is pretty self-explanatory if you\u2019ve ever run paid traffic before, so if your market\u2019s on TikTok, it might be worth you creating a few ads, putting some budget toward experimenting there and seeing what happens. Maybe you can sell more of your products through TikTok! #5: Management services The fifth way you can make money from TikTok is by offering management services for creators on the app. Some creators on TikTok have millions of followers and sometimes this happens really fast and overnight for that creator. It\u2019s like having a business land in their lap. You could step in and offer services to help them with their content strategy, their creative strategy, maybe managing offers and deals that come their way. So if you have that background in production or storytelling, you could definitely apply that to offering management services to TikTok creators. #6: Consulting Last but not least, once you become a pro on TikTok, and maybe you really understand how someone could take a video that maybe gets a hundred views and help them get 100,000 views, well, you can simply offer consulting services. This is a really great way to leverage your expertise from the platform and help people who want to be TikTok famous or they want to be creators, actually boost their strategy so their videos get seen by hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. Of course, you need to have the background and the experience in this first to offer this as a service. But once you\u2019re there, people will pay to have your experience and your brain on their account. And if you help them get any deals or influencer agreements, you can even negotiate a percentage or a cut of that deal simply because you are their consultant and you have helped them go viral on TikTok.  So there you have it. Six ways that I see people making money from TikTok today, even while it\u2019s still really, really early on. I mean, in today\u2019s day and age, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other app or platform that can give you those kinds of results right now.

            "answer_text": "TikTok, of course, has not yet promoted itself as much as YouTube, and its users do not yet have such an effective way to make money on advertising as with YouTube, but its popularity is growing rapidly. More recently, there has been an impressive TikTok growth, and by 2018 more than 660 million videos from around the world have been uploaded to it. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company ranked first in the Apple App Store in terms of downloads. TikTok did not take a long time to create a new generation of influencers. Now, these people are quite young, but thanks to their activities at TikTok their earnings are very high. However, before you begin to monetize your TikTok account, you need to recruit thousands of subscribers. How much can you earn in TikTok? As with any activity, income can be obtained in several ways. However, we have developed our TickTok Advertising and Revenue Cost Calculator to help you calculate the estimated revenue from your account based on your engagement and subscribers. How to make money in Tick Tok? The main ways to make money on Tick Tok Subscriber supportBrand Partnerships and Marketing ActivationsVisiting brand eventsSale of goodsCross-promoter in other social networks The main ways to make money on Tick Tok Please note that you must be over 16 years old before you can start earning (directly) on TikTok (with the consent of your parents). You must be 18 years old to work with brands and third parties legally. However, it may be that some young users make money selling products in collaboration with their parents. Subscriber support During the prosperity of TikTok - Make Your Day, live broadcast became extremely popular. The name may have changed, but the live broadcast remains in the form of Go Live. In order for you to broadcast live, you must have at least 1000 subscribers. Your subscribers can give you coins live. After you accumulate enough of them, you can exchange them for real money. It is best to think of coins as a TikTok virtual currency. TikTok users buy coins ranging from 100 to 10,000 coins. The price for each package varies at different times and depends on the size of the selected package and currency. At the time of this writing, users could buy 100 virtual coins for $ 0.99. They store their coins in an online wallet and then give them worthy live tickers to the worthy in their opinion. TikTok and Google / Apple (depending on your platform) keep half the amount spent. In practice, when a user enjoys playing online, he uses his coins to buy either special emojis or another virtual currency (diamond), which they can give in the ticker chat. The price of each emoji is different. You send them, conveying your emotions as much as possible regarding the activity of the ticker (leaving (diamonds) to the best performer). Artists can exchange gift points at any time, up to a maximum of $ 1,000 per day. Brand Partnerships and Marketing Activations TikTok is no different from most other social networks. If you are quite popular, brands will begin to notice you and will themselves offer you cooperation with them for advertising purposes. The equivalent of \u201cLike\u201d in TikTok is \u201cHeart\u201d. If you get a lot of \"hearts\" for each post, and also regularly respond to comments from your fans, it is likely that brands will begin to monitor your activities. Most likely they will be companies promoting a product that can interest your subscribers. So, if you are popular among subscribers, for example, for girls aged 13 to 18 years, then most likely you will be interested in brands that sell products for teenage girls. The best tickers can earn from 50 to 150 thousand dollars for cooperation with the brand. For the success of marketing on TikTok, it is very important that the brand and the ticker are on the same wavelength, that is, you must correspond to the type of people who can buy brand products. Any influencer should be wary of a brand that is trying to get it to change direction. Your fans watch your videos because they like what you do or say. They do not come to you to watch ads. It\u2019s best to talk casually about brands or unobtrusively use their product in a video. If the promoted product occupies a third of the screen or jars are displayed in a row, then your viewers will be disappointed and call into question your sincerity. You have the right to require partners not to impose a video script on you, but to make it yourself with a touch of improvisation. Do not forget that the FTC influencing marketing guidelines apply to TikTok accounts as well as to any other social platform. If you accepted a prepayment for an advertising post, make sure that you have created a high-quality video and presented the best-advertised product, and generally try to be a bona fide partner. Visiting brand events Some ticktokers can make money off the platform thanks to the reputation they receive on TikTok. Brands often turn to them to appear at events such as Beautycon or Comicon. Typically, a brand pays to represent them on a platform supported by the brand. If, for example, you have a reputation as a good musician on TikTok, then the brand may offer you to perform on their behalf. Sale of goods If you have created a large enough base of subscribers on TikTok, you can consider creating a Shopify e-commerce store and selling products from there to your audience. Experienced marketers can turn their TikTok images into a brand and sell it in the form of goods. By doing this, you create a feeling of exclusivity - subscribers can buy a t-shirt promoting your brand only in your Shopify store through your TikTok account. Wearing this T-shirt, a person will feel special, because he knows that not everyone has access to purchase. The initial step in selling goods is to create a community. You can easily do this together with your fans on T\u0456kTok. In fact, you can create TikTok videos to sell any type of product, not just the Shopify store. If you want to sell crafts on Etsy, make a video showing your products (and possibly even your real production technologies) and upload them to your TikTok channel. Remember that your fans do not watch TikTok see ads for something. If you are uploading a video promoting your products, you need to submit them attractively. It is much easier to do this in some categories. For example, if you do something with your own hands, your videos may reflect the process of creating the product. A variation of the sale of goods may be involved in affiliate marketing. You recommend certain products to your fans and place a link where they go directly to the online store. The store pays you an agreed percentage of sales made by people who clicked on your link. You can also offer discount coupons by encouraging your subscribers to follow your link (rather than buying the product directly at the full price elsewhere). Cross-promoter in other social networks Most successful influencers, known in one particular social network, also have fairly successful accounts in other networks. Being popular with their TikTok videos, many ticktokers also manage successful YouTube accounts. This provides many opportunities for cross-promotion in various social networks. For example, you can create your audience for potential live broadcasts by promoting it. In the same way, you can create a TikTok video and upload it to your YouTube channel, after making sure that you first added YouTube ads. On average, a person regularly uses three or four applications for social networks. One of them may be TikTok, but there are so many people who do not use it. By actively promoting your products and activities at TikTok, you are expanding your overall audience and potential market for your income. Tiktok Income Tips & tricks in short ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A folks. I have written an answer the the exactly same question before and don\u2019t think there is any point in rewriting the previous answer. So, here is the answer below (Click Here for the original answer): There are two direct ways to earn money from Tik Tok. But, you must know that Tik Tok doesn\u2019t pay any money directly to the users or stars of the platform. The two ways as I mentioned before are: Live Stream: When you do live stream on Tik Tok, the viewers watching you can actually gift you money. Off course your content has to be worthwhile and liked by your viewers for them to pay you anything. The viewers don\u2019t send you direct cash, but digital gifts which you can convert into real cash pretty easily though. Tik Tok takes a 20% cut of that digital gift, just so that you know.Influencer: Just like Instagram, if you are popular enough on Tik Tok, brands can regard you as an influencer and pay you money for directly or indirectly advertising their product. I remember an instance when a single mention of a book during a telecast of the Oprah Winfrey show made that book a bestseller. Oprah surely was paid huge sum of money for that and you don\u2019t have to be that influential to earn money from Tik Tok either. Just make sure that you produce good content and have a decent following - that\u2019s the simple trick for becoming influential on Tik Tok.You can also try selling your own products or do affiliate marketing (Selling products of others for a commission) through Tik Tok as well, but it\u2019s not very straightforward. Tik Tok doesn\u2019t allow you to post links on your videos or bio, so the trick is to post a plain text of a webpage of your website and then promote the product or referral links through that webpage. Not very straightforward and not highly recommended either. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi :) You all must be knowing about TikTok & figuring out ways to earn more money online. By the time we finish this article, you will have a clear grasp of how to earn money using TikTok If you don\u2019t know about TikTok then I will soon write an article on what TikTok is and how you can use it online. To give you a brief Tiktok is a short video platform where Creators are making content for the entertainment of the audience. Many of you must be using Tik Tok but still don't know how you can monetize your Tik Tok channel. That is probably because Tiktok is not as famous as YouTube Since TikTok does not come under the umbrella of Google, there is no possibility that you will be able to use Google AdSense on the Tiktok platform. So can you earn money on your Tik Tok Channel By creating short videos? Without wasting your much time let's dig deep. Earn Coins and Convert to Real Money Tiktok was previously known as Musical.ly where its live streaming became very popular amongst the youth. Though on Musical.ly live streaming was available for everyone but on TikTok, to get this feature enabled, you will need a minimum of 1000 followers. Your followers can gift you coins if they like your video. Once you have collected the coins you can convert them into real money. So next time you make a video on Tiktok, keep the interest of your audience in mind as they can make you rich if they like your videos Now the question comes, How do people get the coins? So all these people who are watching your videos are buying the coins and the price of the coins depends upon the the the pack which user is purchasing. Once they have bought these coins this coin gets stored in their wallet. Earn via Emojis & Diamonds TikTok users can also buy emojis and diamonds to gift the creators. Diamonds are the most valuable gift that you can receive from the TikTok Audience. Creators, who are making short videos n the TikTok, can withdraw a maximum up to 1000 Dollars a day. Brand Partnerships & Alliances Tiktok is not very different from the other social media platforms if you have decent popularity. If the audience is loving your content soon the brands will approach you because even the brand representatives are watching TikTok. Just in case brands are not approaching you, you can approach the brand by going to their social media pages or you can register on their websites. The companies whose brand you are representing provides you with a lot of money & their products free of cost. What else do you need :) If you are lucky then the brand may even consider you for their television advertising. You may even get invites for the new businesses that are launching in your cities. I have seen many TikTokers in my network going for the inauguration for Gyms & Restaurants. For example, if you are a good fitness trainer then a new gym opening in your area might invite you for the inaugural ceremony and offer you a free lifetime membership. This is a great saving right? Affiliate Marketing It's just about getting the following and engagement ready on TikTok. Tiktok is a very disruptive way to reach out to your target audience. One word of caution for you: Since people who are watching TikTok come there primarily for entertainment so you have to make sure the videos that you are making are not just brand endorsements, You will have to make it feel natural. If you have partnered with some brand they issue discount coupon on your name and you can share it with your audience while making a video. If these audiences make a purchase using your discount coupon, you will get commission from the brand, and the audience will get discounts. This is called affiliate marketing. This is another way of earning money. Divert the Traffic & Earn on Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram If you have a decent size of following on Tik Tok you can divert the traffic to your other social media channels like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and earn from these platforms using Brand partnerships & Affiliate marketing. If you feel there is some more way to earn money through Tik Tok, please feel free to comment. If you like this article on how to make money from Tik Tok please share this post on social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. ",

            "answer_text": "TikTok is an iOS and Android social media app used for sharing short videos. On TikTok, what users can make and share with their fans is a 15-second video. The videos can feature music, filters, and other fun amenities. The content that you will come across most often is lip-syncing, singing, dancing, and comedy videos. How to make some money on TikTok, you can try the following tips:  Being a TikTok InfluencerIf you want to be an influencer, you need to have a certain number of fans, and currently the person with the most followers on TikTok is charli d'amelio (57.1 million). If you can get 500,000 followers on TikTok and have a high engagement rate, you can probably make $450 a month. But the number of fans is not the only factor to judge how much money you can make, and fan engagement is also very important. Interaction with fans is the basis of the popularity of the TikTok account. TikTokoker's revenue is also tied to the country they are from and where their fans are located. If you happen to be from a country with strong purchasing power, or if your fans happen to be from a country with strong purchasing power, then your income is a little better.  Selling TikTok AccountYou can start by running an account and developing a certain number of fans. For example, create a food-related account, then attract people who are interested in cooking, and sell that account to food-related brands. If you don\u2019t see yourself as a long-time TikTok influencer, this may be the perfect choice for you. You get to set yourself one goal (to grow followers in a specific niche) and when you accomplish that, sell your account and say goodbye to it. Get Sponsored by brandsTikToker's revenue comes primarily from sponsored videos. A sponsored video that gets about 100,000 likes can bring you about $1,000 in revenue. If you manage to become a real TikTok star with over 7 million TikTok fans, you can earn between $10,000 and $20,000 from sponsored videos. But you need to pay attention to the frequency of sponsored videos, and never post them one after another, or fans will gradually lose their trust and patience with you, and then they will not follow you anymore.  Livestreaming and Collecting DonationsThis built-in monetizing platform that TikTok created is fascinating. Any TikTok user has an option to purchase coins on their profile. The cost of 100 coins is $1.39. The way this works is that when your favorite creator goes live you can send them the coins you purchased to show them support. The creators or TikTokers that receive the coins can turn them into diamonds and those diamonds can be converted into money via PayPal. To go live you need at least 1,000 followers. So, after you build your profile and have a sufficient number of followers who enjoy and support your videos, you can go live and receive coin donations from loyal followers. Selling Product or ServicesIf you are a brand and your potential target audience is Generation Z and Millennials, then you might consider signing up for TikTok's ad program, creating unique ads, getting more views and better selling your product or service. You may already be familiar with the process, as Instagram and Facebook offer the same service.  Of course there might be some other ways to earn a lot on TikTok, such as Offering Management Services to TikTok Creators, Consulting on a Niche Topic, and so on. However, TikTok hasn't been around for a particularly long time, and we can think of it as a new platform for brands to promote their products. Compared to Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, and some other social media platforms, the number of influencers who have already amassed a large following on TikTok isn't huge, and whoever can get a head start with them will be able to capture this potential market more. Thus, get a start and try to make yourself famous on TikTok will help you earn more. ",

Of course, even this way earns a lot of money. Now, Do you wonder how Tiktok will make money? Tiktok derived from China, that\u2019s why it is so more popular in Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia than the others one. Currently Tiktok video social network has about 400 million users. This number is only in China. There are many more areas in the world that have not been statistics. Members of this social network will create short videos with a duration of only about 15 seconds but with creative, unique content and viewers can watch and review. Most users of this social network are young members, born after 2000. And \u201cthey are also willing to click on advertising. Brands that buy ads on this social network are encouraged to create videos like regular clips but insert their logos or logo images.\u201d  Thanks to that, there are advertising videos watched by a user in many times. Nikkei Asian Review interviewed some users. The results all showed that they had met and watched a clip of a user's idea but then knew it was an advertisement. The content of brands is well integrated to the level of watching once, no one recognizes that it is the symbol of the brand. Tiktok is the largest download application in China. This social network also developed in Japan, Vietnam, the United States, India. Chinese companies are expected to spend about $ 8.8 billion to advertise on video sharing platforms. This number is 5 times higher than in 2013 but the effect is that Z generation (those born after 2000) is more attracted by these ads. According to JD.com CEO, a Tiktok advertising brand: \"We are looking for ways to attract more young shoppers so we will enhance our presence on this platform and other platforms \u201d. Tiktok's revenue now comes from 2 activities. They are providing two types of ads: Play when opening appsDisplaying ads with business accounts=> The biggest revenue comes from helping businesses create advertising as a normal video. Depending on the number of ad clicks, the average price per impression is being calculated at 1 Yuan ($0.15).  If you have an account of Tiktok , you should exploit it thoroughly.

            "answer_text": "The TikTok video-sharing app has made tremendous strides in popularity since it was released for Android and iOS in 2017. In Tik Tok's own words: \"Tok is the world's leading app for short-form mobile videos.\" The idea behind TikTok is that people can quickly and easily create short videos with their smartphones so that everyone can be a media designer. As of January 2020, there are more than 500 million active monthly users of the app, making it a leading provider in the world of social media apps. 4 ways to make money on TikTok There are 4 methods the TikTok creators can make money from their short videos: Method # 1: Live Streaming Live streaming on TikTok, which is mainly based on musical performances (whether lip-syncing or live), used to take place via the URL Live.ly company| Bringing Communication To Life, but has since been transferred to http://musical.ly. The actual mechanisms vary over time, but the basic system is simple: TikTok users can buy \"coins\" with real money via in-app purchases. They can then use their coins (and other in-app derived currencies) to tip the TikTok writers, which essentially gives them a small amount of real money as a thank you for creating good live content. TikTok gives 80% of the value of this donation to the person making the live stream. It is generally not a fortune, but it can be a stream of income, although one must accept the money in the form of digital gifts rather than cash; however, it isn't all that difficult to turn that into cold hard money. Method # 2: Promote and market your own products This is probably the most realistic way for most people to make money on TikTok, even without having a large fan base and becoming a national influencer. The secret is that you have a different industry or business and you are using TikTok as an absolutely free way to promote and sell your product or service or promote your existing business. The great thing is that this can be just about any (legal) business or service, whether it's nerdy, smart, tech, or just crazy. For example, you can have a canoeing service. Well, you can make videos of every river trip you do and make 15-second clips that show how much amazing fun people are having. Post that on TikTok, along with some promotional images showing where you are, how to get in touch, what to ask for and when your next trip is, and you can find your bookings fill up on their own. TikTok doesn't pay you directly for anything, but your business is now making thousands of dollars from the referrals and new customers you attract with your videos. (And of course, you can also publish the videos on your Facebook page, YouTube channel, etc.). Another example is someone who has a craft business - let's say you make cool glass sculptures out of molten glass. You can make super-fast How-I-Do-It videos showing your techniques (and how good you are at highlighting your best and most beautiful work) and casually mention that you sell these sculptures through your website, which you then go to create a link. Not only do the how-to videos attract people who like your work, but you can also sell products straight from your videos and instead of paying for the bandwidth, TikTok does it for you. Method # 3: affiliate marketing At TikTok, there are several ways to make money from affiliate marketing. On the one hand, influencers can add classic links to their TikTok videos that lead to their own YouTube or Instagram channel. Users who follow influencers on these channels automatically become the target group of the affiliate links displayed there. Another possibility is to include personal discount codes in the videos. The users can use these for their purchases from the respective brand and the affiliate receives a commission. Method # 4: sponsorship At TikTok, sponsorship mostly takes the form of videos that are labeled \u201cpaid content\u201d. Often influencers who already have a certain reach are written to directly by the brands. Of course, this also works the other way around: Influencers can write to companies directly and suggest an advertising partnership. Platforms such as Universal Music, Sony Music, or Warner Music support TikTok users when they want to increase the streaming numbers for a known song or make an old song known again. I hope you have liked the suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes you can Make Money on TikTok This is what works for me : Use TikTok as a Promotional Outlet If you already happen to be an influencer, or you\u2019re already popular on other social media, you can use TikTok to tap into an audience you may not be reaching yet. TikTok has a much younger audience that you may not be interacting with yet. It\u2019s a great way to create more content in the most popular types of videos being made today. You can use your new-found audience to direct traffic to your YouTube channel or something similar, to increase your ad-revenue. Many TikTokers will upload their videos to Instagram as well, to reach their audience that may not be on the TikTok platform yet. Just search #TikTok on Instagram to see how other creators are taking advantage of this. Get Sponsors Once you\u2019ve obtained a decent sized following on TikTok, you can get sponsorships. Make sure that your twitter account has a business email displayed for potential sponsors to contact you. You can also work with a manager to hook you up with more sponsors. The sponsors will pay you to promote their product on your social media platforms. This is a source on income for most of the major influencers. Sell Merch If you have a large audience, you might want to consider selling merch in the form of shirts, hoodies, ect. This is another very popular form of income for many of the top TikTok stars. There are lots of different merch companies that you can work with to create clothing for your fans. These are the top ways I make money from TikTok. Hope you like the information. Please share this with every TikToker who are struggling to make money form TikTok app. If you know any other way to earn money form TikTok then you can comment about it. ",

            "answer_text": "TikTok is a completely different platform than other mediums - YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, blogging - and you should have this in mind when figuring out how to generate revenue on TikTok.  There are a number of ways that you can generate income on TikTok. I\u2019ll talk about a few of the main ways here (I also wrote an article with 11 ways to make money on TikTok on my website if you\u2019d prefer to read more in-depth). First, know that people consume content on TikTok mainly to be entertained. The sector of education is also quickly growing. So if you can build content in a way that is educational but also entertaining, you\u2019ll be in a great spot to take advantage of revenue-generating opportunities. Ok, so how do you actually make money on TikTok? For starters, there isn\u2019t a direct method. TikTok doesn\u2019t (currently) pay you money. But once you have at least 1,000 followers, you are allowed to add a link to your profile. This means that you can drive traffic to \u2014\u2014 your website, your YouTube channel, your Instagram page, your offer, or your squeeze page. So, let\u2019s discuss a few of the ideas: Be an influencer and sell merch and/or get brand deals. In this scenario, you might lean on the idea of making entertaining content over educational. Entertaining content has a better chance to go viral and allow you to grow faster.If you grow a large enough following, then you can create merch using print on demand (if you\u2019re not familiar, you can see more about it in this article). If you have enough followers, you\u2019ll be able to line up brand deals so that you can be an ambassador for brands and be paid by them. But I would argue that well before you get to that number of followers, you could generate money by referring products and services you use through affiliate marketing. Being an influencer works if your content has a mass appeal and you have the ability to have a large diverse audience. The other main way is to: Strategically create niche content and sell products or services. With this strategy, you still need to make educational (and hopefully entertaining content). But this time you\u2019ll be strategically building relationships, creating call to actions, etc. You might want to direct folks to follow you on YouTube (where maybe you have more educational content and links to your products or services). You may want to tell folks to send you a DM on Instagram (where you can begin to build a relationship. You may want to offer a freebie that folks can download from the link in your bio (you can also use a service like Linktree to create multiple links within a single link). You may want to encourage users to follow you for more videos. You may ask folks questions and engage with them in the comments. Notice that I have not yet mentioned to directly sell to anyone on the TikTok platform. This is because people don\u2019t come to purchase on TikTok. Why do they come? You know! To be entertained or educated. So do those things and then build a relationship with your users. Then get them in your community (hopefully their email address) and then you can eventually sell. So be your own brand, build an audience, create trust, and then down the line you can look at offering your new community your product or service.  ",

            "answer_text": "TikTok videos can be transported to YouTube to get views. If your video is used as an ad on YouTube, YouTube may count views of your ad as views on your video. These paid advertising views are counted as views because they indicate that a viewer engaged with the video. You cannot get the Ad revenue because of copyright issues, but you can earn money from other ads. Let's first look at an example on YouTube: Best TikTok Compilations  This account was registered on April 12, 2017 and now has 490,036,250 views and 2 million subscribers, and he doesn't get the Ad revenue from YouTube. But on the video description, he is selling his own products. Another ad revenue way is helping new music producers to promoting their music. He added the music at the beginning of a video usually. If he wasn't making money, why did he last so long? So this method must be profitable. How to make money like him? You need to search and collect some videos on TikTok. You can search videos by hashtags, or some topics.Download TikTok videos without watermarks. Actually you can remove watermarks after downloading videos with watermarks, but it is going to waste a lot of your time. So download videos without watermarks on TikTok is the best way.

Simple figures: If youtube pays $1/CPM (1000 views), Then 29,000,000 views gives you 29,000CPMs = $29,000. These videos are very simple to compile. Just create a Youtube channel and pull together 20 short videos from TikTok running on a particular sequence or song and that's it.Get Big On TikTok: Get big there and then drive the traffic to your advantage in 2 ways. A) Promote Affiliate products that fall within the appeal of the demographics of your following.

Today, I will explain how exactly people make money from TikTok? To explain this let me tell you I won\u2019t be only answering how people earn money from TikTok but how they earn because of their TikTok. Trust me both are different. Paid Promotion on TikTok People who are popular and famous on TikTok used to get paid by brands (it can be a shop, app or anything) to showcase their product on their video. It is one of the trending approaches to get huge exposure. Instagram Shoutout I have seen people giving a paid shoutout on Instagram. People who love your videos will surely follow you on Instagram. Brands pay a lot of money to influencers for promotion. Gifts Sometimes you don\u2019t have to do anything. Brands send you gift with a note mentioning their name. This is a great way to show that you appreciate influencer\u2019s work and want to gift them something. (Marketing Strategy) Party Guest Restaurants and places used to invite influencers to attract more people to the event. It can be a paid invitation or friendly invitation. ",

            "answer_text": "Selling Products Selling products. It\u2019s probably the first thing that came to mind, right? Today, there are over 650,000 ecommerce websites that generate $1,000+ annual profit \u2013 a number which is only growing year-on-year. And the best part is, anyone can set one up! How to Create Your Own Ecommerce Website DIY ecommerce website builders, such as Shopify and BigCommerce, have made it easier than ever for non-techie folk to create their own online store. They are online tools that come with pre-designed templates. All you have to do is pick a template, add your own content and products, and embed any features you need. Selling a Service Another common way people make money online is by selling their services. It could be anything \u2013 from creating tailored diet plans, to a window cleaning business. This works in much the same way as online stores. The big difference is, you don\u2019t need an ecommerce-specific website builder. How to Sell Your Service Online Website builders like Wix and Squarespace are even easier to use than ecommerce platforms. Wix in particular is arguably the easiest way to create your own website. Affiliate Marketing Thanks to the rise of bloggers and \u2018influencers\u2019, affiliate marketing is more popular than ever. You may well have used an affiliate link without even realising it. But what does it actually mean, and how can it make you money? Affiliate marketing is an arrangement between your website and a company whereby you direct potential customers towards their site. How Does Affiliate Marketing Work? There are two different ways of generating profit from affiliate marketing: CPC (cost per click), or CPA (cost per acquisition). Similar to ads, CPC is where you receive money every time someone clicks a link on your site that sends them to the affiliate (partner company). Sponsored Posts \u2018Sponsored posts\u2019 is a phrase that gets bandied about a lot on Instagram. It\u2019s synonymous with Influencers, who use their massive follower base to promote products in return for cash. It\u2019s not just Instagrammers who can get in on the action, though. As your website grows in popularity, you may find companies reach out to you in the hope you\u2019ll promote their brand. Be careful, though \u2013 in order to keep your reputation intact, you\u2019ll only want relevant sponsored posts that fall in line with your visitors\u2019 interests. There\u2019s also very strict guidelines stating that you need to declare to your visitors that the content you\u2019re producing is sponsored. If it\u2019s something you\u2019re considering, brushing up on the FTC guidelines is a good place to start. For example, if you run a site that reviews and compares watches, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to host content from a company that sells furniture. What you may look to feature is a watch repair brand, or possibly jewellery that complements the watches you review. This way, you\u2019re not only providing your visitors with relevant and engaging content, but you\u2019re also making money simply by featuring another brand. Talk about win-win! Google Adsense If you've visited any website, you've seen Google ads. These ads are everywhere, and for good reason. Not only are they easy to set up on any basic website, but they can be lucrative once your website starts bringing in a steady amount of traffic. One of the cool things about Google AdSense is that it's so easy to get set up. If you have a blog or website, you can sign up for a free Google AdSense Account. From there, Google will give you a unique code that you will paste onto your website. Google takes it from there, tracking your page views, traffic, and earnings on your behalf. There is no upkeep or maintenance to get this thing going, which makes it a no-brainer if you have a website already. ",

            "answer_text": "I would answer it in two different ways of earning money and earning trust. Most of the people who are on TikTok would think of monetizing their presence by collaborating with famous brands and promote their products however there are some more points that I would add with the tips of earning money from it.  \u00b7 Start with a clean and catchy profile and focus on getting a good number of followers by uploading humorous as well as viral content on your profile. \u00b7 Start a YouTube channel and connect your account with that too to get a double benefit from a single following list. \u00b7 Catch the trending songs or dialogues and start making videos on those songs because people would always like to listen to that specific part of a song that you would make a video on. \u00b7 Connect your social media channels with your TikTok account and ask your audience or engage them with some quiz to follow you on social media. \u00b7 Now, when you would put that much effort eventually your following will be on the highest point, brands would start contacting you to promote their products and services. The second point that I want to add is that never promote a brand that you know would not serve your audience or would not be relevant for the people you are connected to. Doing so could lead to a loss of followers because everybody out there has an image of your work in their mind, so maintain that. ",

TikTok also notifies users when popular creators are \u201cLIVE streaming\u201d (the feature isn\u2019t available for every user).

Tik Tok earning module:- TikTok offers in-app purchases of coins, starting at 100 for $0.99 and leveling up to 10,000 for $99.99. Users can give coins to their favorite creators, who can, in turn, exchange them for digital gifts. Mobile intelligence firm Sensor tower reported that TikTok users worldwide spent $3.5 million on in-app purchases during the month of October 2018, which is nearly four times what they did in October 2017. (It\u2019s unclear what the platform itself earns from this, but TikTok makes a day had a similar system and received 20% of each tip.) Agencies also may start advertising on TikTok going forward given its explosive popularity. The Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, offers splash ads that can cost up to 1 million Renminbi (about $150,000) for one day and newsfeed ads for 30 Renminbi (about $4) per click, Brands like Pizza Hut have done such campaigns.
