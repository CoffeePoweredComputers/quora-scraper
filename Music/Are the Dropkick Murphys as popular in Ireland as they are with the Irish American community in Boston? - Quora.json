Its something that always amused me when I would visit my family in Canada, and go to the local \u2018Irish\u2019 pub, was the music played, plenty of the likes of Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphy\u2019s, but very few actual songs from contemporary Irish bands. Here in Ireland they would be known be a good minority of people. The last time they played a gig of their own as far as I know, they played in the Vicar Street Venue that has a capacity of between 1000\u20131500 people, they had a sell out crowd on the Saturday night, don\u2019t know about the sunday. I like a fair bit of their stuff, but actually more for their left wing politics than their Irishness. ",

I think on average most people who\u2019ve heard of them have heard of them because of that. The market for the kind of Irish-American Oirishness that the DMs produce is much bigger in America than in Ireland, though. ",
