            "answer_text": "No, this is impossible. Even though modern technology allows us to connect any computer to any server on the other side of the planet, using undersea cables that are hundreds of miles long, connecting continents across oceans, somehow nobody has figured out how to play mp3 files without an internet connection yet. Currently, however, a team of experts is working on the problem in an unprecedented attempt to solve one of our biggest problems to date. It has been given the status of \u201cGalactic Problem\u201d, similar to the mathematical \u201cMillenium Problems\u201d, but of a much larger scale. The so-called \u201cphonographs\u201d that came up in the late 19th century are considered a huge scam that managed to fool the whole world, making our generation shake our heads to this day. CD\u2019s were actually an experiment administered by the NSA that, according to certain sources, was supposed to damage our brains so that everyone would think they were listening to music. so if anyone tells you that they\u2019re listening to music without an internet connection, tell them to grow up and educate themselves. [in cased you haven\u2019t realised, of course you can listen to music without an internet connection, you just need mp3/wav/etc. files on your computer/phone, a vinyl disk and a phonograph, or a CD and a CD player] ",

So, if you want to listen to music without using the internet, get a CD\u2026 or a Vinyl if you want to go the hipster route\u2026 And if all else fails, there is still radio. I mean, sure, I also don\u2019t really see the appeal of using physical media these days, but, they are an option if you are without internet. Hell, you might even get interested in bygone media and have some fun with older tech, (re)live the days people associated pencils with their stereo, or go even further back and get open reel to reel to play after failing five times to get the tape threaded into the playback machine correctly. Or basically: are you really that dependent on the internet for your music? If yes, you might want to overthink stuff. ",

Be sure to inspect used CDs for scratches before buying them. Records are another option that can be very inexpensive when purchased second-hand. However, records are more fragile than CDs. Records that have been played on poor quality/badly adjusted turntables, with worn-out needles, or simply too many times can have damage that is invisible but that will make them sound awful. Playing shellac 78 RPM records requires a special needle different from those designed for vinyl records. There are several types of magnetic tape media: Compact Cassettes, open reel, 8-track, and Pocket Rockers. All of these can be found on the used market, although the Pocket Rockers were somewhat of a novelty item with a very limited selection of titles. ",

Go and actually see music being made by people, instruments and devices right in front of your very eyes. Attend shows and gigs that feature local acts, symphonic concerts, group shows and open mikes of any and all genres. Watching the music being crafted and played right in front of you is a miraculous multi-sensoral phenomena that can touch you through vibration, emotionality, mood, atmosphere, delivery. I also highly encourage going to see local musicians and ensembles in more intimate and smaller venues \u2014 maybe even attend a house party or 2 where music is being showcased by the talent in your city, town or neighborhood. These contexts are where the direct human connection between performer, the music and a listener establishes the deepest resonance with what music is all about. ",
