            "answer_text": "According to Cynthia you couldn't call what John did to her physically as beating, he slapped her once hard during a fit of jealousy when he found she and Stuart Sutcliffe dancing. This was before they ever married and it caused them to break up, so yes obviously she forgave him. Of course it's much more complex than the fact John slapped her and she forgave him. John verbally beat up many people who loved him and I don't believe he ever stopped doing that. He once screamed so loudly in Sean's ear to leave him alone Yoko took him to hospital to check his ear and hearing, Sean from what I read was around three years old at the time. So long after John had supposedly gotten better. Verbally he beat every person who loved him from Aunt Mimi, Cynthia, Julian, Paul, George Harrison, Brian Epstein to Yoko and Sean. He couldn't help it I suppose, I don't believe he wanted to be like that. I believe that he felt immense guilt over his outbursts and then conversely continued doing the same thing. John was a very angry person and a very fearful one. He was learning how to manage his anger, I don't believe he ever learned how to deal with his fear. He would make people he loved swear to never leave him, such as Cynthia and Paul, and then leave them behind. He often spoke of his father abandoning him at five years old being one of the roots of his dysfunction. He then turned around and did the very same thing to Julian at the same age. It makes many Lennon fans furious when it's pointed out that this is a glaringly clear example of John being a hypocrite. He insisted on marrying Cynthia because he didn't want a son of his growing up without a daddy as he had even when she told him he didn't have to. Yeah, well the world knows what happened with that. Yoko Ono came along wanting a Beatle, stalked, bagged and married John Lennon. He abandoned his son at the same age Alf Lennon left for Australia or was it New Zealand. What fails to be said is that Alf had come to take John with him and Julia along with Mimi stopped it from happening. How different John's life might have been, it's difficult to say except that he probably wouldn't have been a Beatle but happier? Maybe. He might even have returned to Mimi as a teenager and still met Paul then George and finally Ringo. But in case you missed it, yes Cynthia forgave John for slapping her one time, she loved him unconditionally.  ",

She broke up with him and she took him back a few months later after he said he was sorry a number of times. It\u2019s a misconception that he beat her whilst married or multiple times. He had said he had been a hitter of women but we don\u2019t know how many times he did it. Obviously once was one time too many. ",
