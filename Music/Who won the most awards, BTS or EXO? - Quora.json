            "answer_text": "UPDATED ANSWER AS ON APRIL 2020\u2026\u2026OF COURSE BTS HAS MORE AWARDS!! I have given proper proof from Wikipedia site. BTS has 264 awards and 395 nominations, whereas EXO have 156 awards and 254 nominations. BTS also has the most number of daesangs - and hence have surpassed EXO\u2019s previous record\u201d Check the given Wikipedia link for further proof- List of awards and nominations received by BTS - Wikipediaand List of awards and nominations received by Exo - Wikipedia AND THIS IS WHEN BTS DEBUTED IN 2013 AND EXO DEBUTED IN 2011 (but was presented to general public officially by releasing their first single on April 2012) #DaesangAllKill at all 3 major Korean Award show~ 2019 Melon Music Awards, 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards and 2020 Golden Disk Awards, BTS became the first and the only group to win all 4 daesangs Also making them the artist with the most daesang wins in Mnet Asian Music Awards history. ~Won 4 Billboard awards~ TOP SOCIAL ARTIST in 2019, 2017, 2018 ~ TOP DUO/GROUP (Talent base award in main category) defeating top western artist like IMAGINE DRAGONS, MAROON 5, DAN & SHAY . ~Won 4 American Music Awards aka AMAs~ FAVOURITE SOCIAL ARTIST in 2019, 2018 ~ TOUR OF THE YEAR in 2019 ~ FAVOURITE DUO/GROUP (Talent base award in main category) ~Presented an award and performed at GRAMMYs~ BTS was also invited to Grammy in 2019 and had an all exclusive photo-shoot which only Grammy winners get (which shows how much influence they have overseas too). And became the 1st Korean artist to ever perform on the grammy stage in 2020. BTS also featured in South Korea\u2019s National anthem, and are the youngest recipient and the only IDOLS who won Order of Cultural Merit (BIGGEST AWARD TO BE AWARDED TO A KOREAN ARTIST BY THE PRESIDENT). BTS are the first group since Beatles to have 4 albums topping Billboard200 chart!! #4 BILLBOARD HOT100 (For the first time in history for Korean group to chart so high) BTS are the 1st Korean artist who have PERFORMED at all major global platforms: Ellen Show, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, SNL, Stephen Colbert, James Corden, American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Grammys, America Got Talent, Britain Got Talent, The Voice, Good Morning America, Jingle Ball, New year\u2019s Rocking Eve, Graham Norton, Today's Show BTS has broke many records not only in Korea but United kingdom, USA too. Performing at WEMBLY AND ROSE BOWL \u2014 where iconic singer like Michael Jackson etc have performed (can hold 90000 plus people) and all concerts of their 2019 world tour are already sold out mostly within 1 hour in America and UK and many more, so much that they have to add more concerts!! AND BECAME THE TOP TOURING ARTIST OF THE MONTH for their world tour 2019 according to Billboard official news with more than $75 million earned. BTS has 3 PLATINUM SINGLES (means more than 10,00,000 copies sold) and 5 GOLD SINGLES and 3 PLATINUM ALBUMS as certified by RIAA in USA only, hence became the first-ever Korean group to do so!! Their album MAP OF THE SOUL:PERSONA is trending at number 1 in more than 73 countries in the world and had sold more than 4 million albums just in one month!! And their latest album MAP OF THE SOUL:7 have made record of last preorders in South Korean history with almost 4.02 Million pure preorders. Recently only when BTS returned back from their world tour, whole BUSAN AND SEOUL (for BTS fanmeeting ) famous places in Korea WAS PAINTED \u201cPURPLE\u201d TO HONOUR BTS. Also BTS Estimated to Have a $4.6 Billion Impact on South Korea\u2019s Economy. BTS ALSO HAS VARIOUS Guinness World Records : Most viewed music video online in 24 hours by a K-pop groupMost Twitter engagements (average retweets) overallMost Twitter engagements (average retweets) for a music groupMost viewed YouTube music video in 24 hoursFirst Korean act to reach No.1 on the Billboard 200 albums chartFirst Korean act to reach No.1 on the US Artist 100Most viewed YouTube music video in 24 hoursMost viewed YouTube video in 24 hoursMap of the Soul: Persona by BTS Best-selling album in South KoreaFastest to reach 1 million followers on Tik-TokBTS deserve to be here, as they do not come from BIG 3 COMPANIES in Korea like EXO OR BLACKPINK OR TWICE DO, they were called the \u201cdirty spoon\u201d because of their small company, but they surpassed that all, and now their company more than worth $1 Billion . (I don\u2019t hate any of those groups mentioned, they are just examples) EXO is still very popular & are promoting in Korea but due to BTS global achievements & recognition, BTS got a upper hand in awards, as they win not only in Korea but worldwide too. But in the end both groups are great, and there can't be any comparisons, as both of the groups have different dynamics, hence I have only talked about BTS here as I am familiar with their achievements, and made no comment on EXO.

There is a Legit List of Most Awarded Artist in the World.. and This List is not Ranked. Michael Jackson (800+ Awards in 45 years) Followed by Whitney Huston (600 awards in 35 years), then Beyonc\u00e9 (400) \u00bb\u00bb Lady gaga \u00bb\u00bb Taylor Swift. >> Then Our \u2018E X O\u2019 (The Youngest Artist Ever to make the List) Followed by BigBang, Girls Gen., Super Junior Hope this will Clear the Misconception of Updated n Old Tags used by People for their Answer..
