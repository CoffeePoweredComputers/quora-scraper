            "answer_text": "Royalty Free Music is certainly one the most confusing topics these days. If you ask around you will end up getting some wildly different answers, from free to use to no copyright to safe to use on YouTube. According to Wikipedia, a royalty free license grants you the right to use copyrighted material (music in our case) without the need to pay royalties or license fees for each use or per volume sold, or certain time period of use or sales. If you want to use our music in a series of corporate videos, you don\u2019t have to purchase additional licenses every time you make a new video. If you put that video on YouTube, you are not required to pay any royalties if your video reaches 100, 1,000, or 1,000,000 views. If you use our music in a commercial for sale product, you are not required to pay royalties each time you sell a copy. In vast majority of cases, your video, film, etc. containing PRO registered music will be publicly broadcasted via a TV network, a video sharing Web site like YouTube, Vimeo, etc, or a venue that already has a blanket performance license. Please note that all PRO registered music is clearly identified in the catalog. Royalty free is the licensing option made specifically for copyrighted music. Only the public domain recordings are copyright free. Royalty free music only refers to the right to use copyrighted music without the need to pay royalties for recurring use. As a matter of fact, in most cases, you do need to pay certain amount of money to obtain that right. That is, to purchase the royalty free license. Likewise, free music may or may not be royalty free. Many composers offer their music for free for personal listening or willing to waive the initial sync fees, yet expect royalties if their music gets used in a film or advertisement. Please note that purchasing royalty free music refers strictly to purchasing a license to use the music under the conditions specified in the license. If you are looking for music for commercial use please choose the license that explicitly allows commercial business use. ",
