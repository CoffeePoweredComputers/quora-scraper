            "answer_text": "I would like to see a comparison test where you have 100 professional electric guitarists blindfolded, and handed an assortment of guitars to play, and then asked to give a rating on how much they liked it. My hunch is that you would end up with data suggesting that price has very little relationship to rating. My point is that most people are going to make decisions about guitars based on things like brand and model names which are a pretty horrible guide to what is really the best for you. For the $5,000 scenario, I predict most people are going to end up buying a fancy Gibson Les Paul (custom shop), but not because they really know what makes that particular guitar so valuable and special. It will be more about the magical power of the name \u201cGibson\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that a Gibson Les Paul is a bad choice, (although it is an obvious one), but I am saying that, unless your goal is just to get a guitar that will impress the largest number of guitar players, you would be better off trying to forget what you think you know about guitars, and simply try playing a much wider assortment of guitars, as if you were blindfolded. Ask yourself, what really feels best to me? What really sounds best to me? What am I able to play most effortlessly? Open your mind to what you experience when playing the guitar, vs. what you \u201cknow\u201d about the guitar. I can imagine people trying to play a guitar as though they are blindfolded, but the fact is, they do know this is a Les Paul they are playing, and at some level, they are telling themselves, \u201cthis is the one, this is a $5,000 Les Paul\u201d, which completely affects their perceptions of the instrument. But even if you decide to buy a fancy Les Paul, do yourself a favor, and make yourself play a whole bunch of them. By the way, I can easily relate to this whole brand name thing. When I think of a Gibson Les Paul, I immediately think of Peter Frampton, and how much I loved \u201cFrampton Comes Alive\u201d. I think of Jimmy Page, and the incredible music of Led Zeppelin. I think of Al di Meola, and his amazing chops. And I know how powerful it is to associate yourself with people like that by playing the same kind of guitar. I do get it. And I do love Les Pauls. ",

            "answer_text": "This question may seem simple, but the answers really depend on what you're looking for\u2026 5k is a chunk of change to spend on a guitar, and for that amount of money, you'd think that every category of a great guitar (best raw materials, manufacture place, assembly, set-up, and resale and value over time) are considered. My own personal experience and opinion, I would say for that price, only 4 electric guitars that are not custom luthier made would be as follows: Gibson LesPaul Custom or Supreme with a hand carved maple top and ebony fretboard and all burstbucker electronics would be on the top of the list. Next would be an all American made and assembled Fender stratocaster with all one piece alder body, birds eye maple neck and all reverse wound PAF pick ups. Then I would say a Dean Stratovarius (original Dean, not after market) would be in there as well\u2026I have owned a few high dollar Grover Jackson guitars as well, the ones for close to 5k that are at the high end of their public production guitars are the Phil Collen model, or the American made San Dimas model strats with the Koha wood and maple necks\u20265k is a lot to pay for a guitar, and in my opinion, you are just getting a lot of visual perks after about 3500 dollar mark that really have little to do with the playability of the instrument, its all about flash and window dressing at that point\u2026peace\u2026jlg\u2026 ",
