            "answer_text": "1: Bon Bon Chocolat was better than Adios. i love Adios, but BCC is so much more unique. i haven\u2019t heard anything like it before. Adios was structured the exact same way as KTL and the rap parts sounded like Jennie and Lisa. it just wasn\u2019t it for me. 2: The line distribution isn\u2019t fair the distribution is very unfair. take a look:  Adios line distribution.  Bon Bon Chocolat line distribution. as you can tell, Aisha and E:U get the least amount of lines in both of their title tracks. they are just six members, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to split it equally. (this is a problem in many groups, i\u2019m not saying it\u2019s just Everglow.) 3: Onda seems lost i really like Onda, but i don\u2019t really see her purpose in the group. she can sing pretty well, but not outstandingly good. she\u2019s very pretty, but i feel like the group could do without her. this is just my opinion though, feel free to hate on me all you like. 4: I don\u2019t understand why Mia gets more rap parts than E:U E:U is the main rapper, and still gets the shortest raps, while Mia is a rapper and a vocalist. Mia isn\u2019t even a lead rapper, so i don\u2019t see where that is fair. 5: Aisha is stunning in my opinion, she should be a visual, even though i know she doesn\u2019t fit the korean beauty standards. her height makes her stand out, but her face is just so gorgeous that i can\u2019t stop looking at her. (this is coming from an unbiased point of view) these are all for now~ ~fanny louise ",

            "answer_text": "I do believe Mia should be the center of the group , I really like Yiren she is a stunning visual but she lacks the stage presence that a center should have like Nayeon or Jennie ( I\u2019m taking the as an example caus they are very popular centers that\u2019s it ) . Mia was basically the center during the Adios promotion anyways because of her lines , her dancing skills and expressions on stage so yeah she would make a better centerOnda is an useless member . I know it\u2019s awful to say it but it\u2019s the truth . She is apparently a visual and a lead vocalist yet she\u2019s constantly overshadowed by her members , I constantly forget about her and everglow would do just fine without her.even tho their adios line distribution isn\u2019t fair I do prefer it over the demo where Onda and Eu had more lines . E:U is a good rapper but god her vocals are awful I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s a fact , and Onda gets out of breath really easy so it makes sense they didn\u2019t give her the second chorus .i don\u2019t think arena will join them after Izone\u2019s disbandment. I think the original plan was to add yen\u2019s to everglow\u2019s line up BUT seeing how popular she is getting and how skilled she is I think her company will rather make her a solo artist , having a popular soloist and a girl group will make them do more money",
