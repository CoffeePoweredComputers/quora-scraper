            "answer_text": "There is a lot going on here. I agree fully that artists like to branch out as their careers go on. It\u2019s hard to get a full impression of what the Beatles actually were to the creation of modern pop music until you realize that they went from something akin to a boy band (who played their own instruments) to, well, the Beatles. (At the same time, of course, it\u2019s never a good idea to stray too far from what you know your audience wants to hear, Metallica.) It\u2019s entirely understandable that after seven years, she\u2019d want to switch it up and move into new territory. Thing is, though\u2026 Country!Taylor was always a character she was playing, a consummate professional on stage and a basket case in her personal life. It\u2019s likely that she got tired of playing that character; among other things, it was very infantilizing, because that Taylor was a boy-crazy teenybopper at heart, and by the time she began work on 1989, she was in her mid-20s. This is where we must realize that, by all indications, Taylor had been living a double life for a while, dating guys publicly for short intervals while carrying on behind-the-scenes relationships with women, first with Emily Poe, who she seems to have dated more or less openly, then back in the closet with Dianna Agron; that seems to have ended rather badly. (There were probably other women, it\u2019s rumored that she fell hard for Harry Styles who didn\u2019t return her affection, and the timing of the beginning of her relationship with Karlie Kloss seems extremely suspicious to me(1), but Agron and Poe are the only ones that seem sufficiently well documented to name.) Anyway, beyond this it turns into endless Kaylor discourse, which isn\u2019t too terribly relevant to the question beyond the fact that it definitely happened. This is all by way of pointing out that there had to have been a point where the real Taylor no longer wanted to play the character she\u2019d been playing. She\u2019s a woman whose politics are, though vaguely stated, clearly very liberal, while her country fanbase skewed conservative, as country fanbases do. (No one talks directly about this, but I suspect a lot of the sketchier part of her fan base came from racist reactions to the Kanye incident.) As a feminist, a closeted queer woman(2), and most importantly a businesswoman who took a lot of control over her own career at a young age, she can\u2019t have been too terribly comfortable with this, nor with her childish image as a flighty mess of a dater. In addition to the need to experiment creatively or go stale, I think the shift to pop that was foreshadowed as early as Fearless but only began in earnest on Red was probably a reaction to having to live her life in a fishbowl, typecast into a character that was no longer appropriate to her, if it ever was. A lot of people were confused by \u201cthe old Taylor is dead\u201d from \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d. As the Reputation era begins to wind down, it\u2019s increasingly clear that Taylor was warning people that the character she\u2019s been playing her whole career was about to disappear, and on a stage in Nashville this past August, she began to make good on that. Though ultimately the point was to begin to drop the veil on her rather cryptic personal life, her creative shift seems to have been a major part of it as well, moving from what people wanted from her, back to what she wants to do, the way it was at the beginning. For that reason, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever going to go back to country \u2014 it was her passion as a kid, but it ultimately turned into a straitjacket. (It\u2019s probably relevant that despite her previous level of fame, she didn\u2019t become the Taylor Swift, A+ list singer/songwriter and potential future Queen of Pop, until 1989 came out and became a huge crossover success.) (1) This is all speculation on my part, but IMHO it seems Karlie was quite aggressive pursuing Taylor, and it\u2019s not unlikely that Taylor cheated on Dianna with her. Other Kaylor sleuths who have been doing this longer might have very different opinions. (2) As I write in September 2018, whether she\u2019s bi or lesbian remains unanswered, but the available evidence points towards bi with a preference for women. I mean, just watch her on stage with the Victoria\u2019s Secret models, especially her incredibly brazen hand-in-hand entrance with Karlie for the performance of \u201cStyle\u201d in 2014, and the ensuing shameless flirting with the other models. That is not the behavior of a straight woman, and the Angels all knew it. ",

            "answer_text": "She switched her genre because she wanted to experiment. Artists always try to find new ways to showcase their talents. They experiment with their work. Sometimes people love their new work, sometimes they loose their fans but things must change. Otherwise it will become boring. She started of with country songs since she was comfortable in it. She was born and raised among country songwriters. When she became a little stable and found a place for her in the industry, she began experimenting. She tried to change her genre to pop. And hence, some songs on the RED album are pop songs. She learnt that an album should have one specific style of genre by not winning Grammy that year. Hence she changed completely to pop by introducing 1989. She is trying Electro pop with her new album REPUTATION. Change happens. It may do good, it may do bad. But without change life becomes boring. ",
