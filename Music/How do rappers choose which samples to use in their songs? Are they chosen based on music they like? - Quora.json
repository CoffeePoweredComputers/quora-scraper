            "answer_text": "Producers who sample are usually omnivorous music geeks. They listen to and explore a lot of music and they like a lot of music. So usually a producer starts listening to music, hears something that inspires or excites them, samples it and plays around to make a beat. Then the producer takes the beat to the rapper who decides if they like it and want to hop on it or not. But typically, I think, the rapper is deciding whether they like the finished beat, not the sample by itself. BTW : there\u2019s a good series on YouTube called Rhythm Roulette which gets producers to pick three random records, blind, and then see what they can make with samples they find on them :  In this case, the choice of sample is already heavily constrained. But it gives a glimpse into how producers listen to and think about music to be sampled, what they are listening for and what they do when they find something that grabs them. ",
