            "answer_text": "Before getting specific, I want to say, the music industry on a whole is dark and ugly. Its a machine that exploits and abused their artists. With that said, we can shift out attention towards the K pop industry. Thiers a old cliche saying \u2018 All that glitters is not gold\u2019 It perfectly describes the K pop industry. K pop is known for producing young and attractive idols, music videos that are visually appealing, precise synchronized choreography and catchy songs. The genre is growing in popularity outside of Korea. Groups such as BTS, Blackpink and Twice are gathering many international audiences. Unfortunately behind the fancy outfits and makeups lies a ugly reality. Let's dive right in. Contractual enslavement - It starts with trainees auditioning to become idols at a company. If successful, trainees are selected and undergo training in vocal lessons, dancing and other areas related to entertainment. The training process for idols are long and gruelling. Upcoming stars may train up to 16 hours a day. This leave very little time for sleep and resting. Furthermore, training can last up to a decade. After the training, idols finally get their chance to debut, however life doesn't get easier for them. They are under total control of the company. Many idols are forbidden from dating and personalities are given to them. Idols main function after debut, is to repay their debts. Training, housing, food, accommodation and production of songs and music videos are all done by the company. It's not free. These idols are the investments of companies. An investment is like property and idols are properties of their companies. Unfortunately most K pop idols don't make any significant amount of money, especially in the early years after debut, because they must pay off their debts. Stellar, a disbanded group revealed to no cut news that four of them would often share one meal together, because they had little to no income. You may ask why idols don't leave this rigid and restrictive job? The sad reality is most of them cannot leave because they don't have the funds to get out of their contracts. In other words, idols becomes enslaved. Sometimes these contracts can last over seven years. Unfortunately these contracts tends to benefit the company by exploiting idols. Idol abuse Idols are subjected to all kinds of abuse. It can be verbal, physical, mental, emotional and sexual. Media Line Entertainment CEO kim Chang Hwan was accused of verbal and physical abuse against members of East life. In Hyuna song babe gave an insight of paedophilia in the K pop industry. I advise you to check it out. It's not uncommon for executives and top ranking officials to use their powers in exchange for sexual favours. To further their careers, some idols are forced to engaged in sexual activities with the elites of their companies. Crazy fans - One of the reasons why idols are forbidden to date is to appease their fans . K pop has some of the the most delusional fans. Some of them think they have a shot of actually being in a relationship with their favourite idol. In Korea , some fans are called sasaeng fans. These fans are known for their dangerous obsessions over their favourite idols. Sasaeng fans may stalk and invade personal dwellings of idols. EXO, a Korean boy band, encountered female sasaeng fans at the bathroom of a hotel the group were residing in. The fans shaved their heads to look like boys to avoid suspicion of being females. The gig was up and the girls were found out. There are many examples of sasaeng fans going too far. Next we have anti fans. Anti fans are fans that hate groups or idols. In 2006, Yunho of TVXU was given orange juice. He thought it came from one of the staff members and drank it. After he became ill, Yunho was vomiting and coughing up blood. The orange juice he drank contained super glue. Most likely it was an anti fan who conspired to murdered him. This is one of the reasons why companies forbids their idols for accepting certain gifts and foods by fans. The fandom in K pop is very toxic. Plastic surgery and extreme dieting Do you ever wonder why idols looks so similar? K pop is highly manufactured. Idols appearances are often in line with Korea's beauty standards. Companies send idols to undergo plastic surgeries to mold them into a image that can be marketed and appealing to the public. Let's look at few examples of before and after.     Wide eyes, high nose bridge, and narrow faces are the popular features. Next we have extreme dieting. Most idols are severely underweight because of low calorie diets imposed on them by their companies. The BMI of some of these idols are dangerously low. Let's us examine the heights and weights of past and current groups. Black Pink: Jisoo: 162 cm, 45 kg, 17.1, 24/70Jennie: 163 cm, 50 kg, 18.8, 31/70Rose: 168 cm, 46 kg, 16.3, 17/70Lisa: 166.5 cm, 46 kg, 16.3, 20/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 17.1 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 23/70 ~ Bolbbalgan4: Jiyoung: 165 cm, 45 kg, 16.5, 18/70Jiyoon: 160 cm, 44 kg, 17.2, 26/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 16.9 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 22/70 ~ BP RaNia (without Alex, Ttabo, Hyeme and Sharon): Yina: 171 cm, 48 kg, 16.4, 14/70Jieun: 172 cm, 50 kg, 16.9, 21/70Yumin: 172 cm, 46 kg, 15.5, 8/70Zi.U: 161 cm, 44 kg, 17.0, 23/70Yijo (former member): 170 cm, 49 kg, 17.0, 20/70Joy (former member): 166 cm, 40 kg, 14.5, 5/70Jooyi (former member): 167 cm, 48 kg, 17.2, 22/70Riko (former member): 166 cm, 41 kg, 14.9, 6/70Di (former member): 171 cm, 49 kg, 16.8, 18/70T-ae (former member): 171 cm, 49 lg, 16.8, 20/70Xia (former member): 171 cm, 48 kg, 16.4, 15/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 16.3 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 16/70 ~ Brave Girls (only Yujeong and Eunji): Yujeong: 163 cm, 51 kg, 19.2, 31/70Eunji, 168 cm, 47 kg, 16.7, 18/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 18.0 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 25/70 ~ Brown Eyed Girls: Jea: 158.9 cm, 46 kg, 18.2, 30/70Miryo: 163 cm, 45 kg, 16.9, 18/70Narsha: 158 cm, 48 kg, 19.2, 31/70Gain: 163 cm, 43 kg, 16.2, 11/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 17.6 Girl\u2019s Day: Sojin: 167 cm, 47 kg, 16.8, 16/70Yura: 168 cm, 49 kg, 17.3, 24/70Hyeri: 166 cm, 46 kg, 16.9, 19/70Minah: 165 cm, 47 kg, 17.1, 24/70Jisun (former member): 165 cm, 45 kg, 16.5, 14/70Jiin (former member): 167 cm, 45 kg, 16.1, 11/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 16.8 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 18/70 ~ Girls\u2019 Generation/SNSD: Taeyeon: 158 cm, 45 kg, 18.0, 29/70Sunny: 155 cm, 44 kg, 18.3, 30/70Hyoyeon: 160 cm, 49 kg, 19.1, 31/70Yuri: 166 cm, 46 kg, 16.7, 17/70Yoona: 167 cm, 48 kg, 17.2, 22/70Sooyoung (former member): 170 cm, 49 kg, 17.0, 20/70Tiffany (former member): 163 cm, 51 kg, 19.2, 31/70Seohyun (former member): 168 cm, 49 kg, 17.4, 25/70Jessica (former member): 162 cm, 46 kg, 17.5, 25/70Group\u2019s average BMI: 17.8 Group\u2019s average SBMI: 26/70 We can clearly see that most of the girls are underweight. Korea's fascination over thin bodies is quite harmful. Don't get me wrong, they are people who are naturally skinny and struggles to gain weight, but when you are seeing a common trend of underweight idols, it's an industry criteria. Most of these idols are skinny because of restrictive diets. We have reached the end, I know it's has been a long read, but such a question requires an in depth analysis to fully answer the question. Yes, K pop indeed has a dark and ugly side, but many are blind to this side, because on the surface, it appears very colourful. ",

            "answer_text": "If you watch kpop videos and look at idols your probably thought the bright and shiny kpop star lifestyle protrayed a perfect world of bubblegum and rainbows and they always look so happy and alive! But underneath all of that are some ugly and dark sides of kpop. Any faction of entertainment is bound to have darker secrets, some of these dark open secrets are overlooked. the kpop industry isnt really hidden, children who debut and train at a young age have been exposed to mental and physcial abuse, trust me the truths about kpop life is anything but glamorous. Hard diets When you are training to be a kpop star you are put on very dangerous diets, some consist of only eating a few meals every few weeks, they want you to be as skinny as possible. Your looks are everything and you cant have an ounce of extra weight on you. Many trainees get sick and tired very easily from not eating well. Some idols have fainted or collapsed on stage due to malnutrition. Food helps contain our energy and if you dont consume enough food you become weaker and light headed. They starve themselves to a point where its super unhealthy to acheive toothpick thin bodies. Idols say they losed 20\u201350 pounds in a few weeks when diets only consist of water and one meal every few weeks. Its insane right. Boot Camp Alot of kpop idols had to do a 10 year boot camp, industry leaders do take advantage of this sometimes, beforehand they usually sign like a contract, and if they drop out the leaders get paid a hefty fee so they usually go super hard on them. Leaders can work their trainees as hard as they want, even if they take away sleeping, its crazy right? Some idols had admitted these things happen so this is not made up at all. Plastic Surgery Alot of idols are expected to get plastic surgery, idol life yuor appearance is key to your career. You need to look flawless and perfect 24/7 and plastic surgery is the perfect fit to that. Agencies sometimes force their trainees to undergo plastic surgery to acheive the \u201cperfect\u201d look for their future career. Diets Sure dieting is fine and theirs nothing wrong with that if you want to lose weight but some idols are forced to do super extreme diets. A few of the diets they do are the banana diet and watermelon diet that help idols keep their slender bodies. The paper cup diet is also super popular for idols, they have 9 paper cups and the food you eat per day should fill each one, so 9 paper cup worths of food per day. Over obsessive fans and death threats Alot of people are over obsessive with their favorite idol and go to extreme lengths to get close to them. They are known as saesang fans, and those fans have been known to stalk idols and follow them. Some break into buildings and apartments the idols stay at. A fan once drew a message in her period blood to an idol, and others have urined on their doorway steps. When your famous you most likely have handfuls of haters. Some haters hate them so much they threaten them with their lives. Jimin has received alot of death threats and people claim that they will shoot him on various concerts. Its extremely scary and concerts have been canceled due to the vicious threats some idols receive. Another example is kpop idol Yunho, who consumed a orange cocktail and on stage started coughing up blood and passed out, He was confined to the hospital for many days and they found out the cocktail was filled with a deadly mixture of some sort of orange juice and superglue, so Yunhu literlly coulve died. Idols often take years to make money An average kpop concert earns abobut 4,000 per show and 90% of it goes to the company. And the last 10% is split among every member, which they recieve barely anything. Kpop group AOA didnt start making profit till 2015 even though they started touring in 2012. So new idols work so extremely hard and go to such extreme lengths and they barely recieve any money. You are picked apart due to your race, Culture, and Appearance People pick apart idols, constantly isulting them with these sort of things. Its common for kpop females to be called fat and that pressures them into becoming more thin than they actually are. idols get called ugly and a bunch of racial slurs to their faces every day. Some idols who arent fully Korean get distcriminated, people are very sensitive and are cultury insensitive to other ethnicities. Alot of rampant and hate are thrown to idols who arent fair skinned and have darker skin. Its terrible! Being LGBTQ+ is considered Taboo The first openly lgbtq kpop idol, Holland, made his debut January 2018. Being that is publicaly queer in South Korea, and causes alot of backlash and drama to people who identify themselves as LGBTQ. A female idol also told interviewers she was lesbian in an interview, it spreaded throughout the industry and the agency quickly deleted the footage and the idol stayed quiet. People made fun of her and she attempted suicide but failed, from what i have learned if your a kpop idol and your LGBTQ never come out because you will recieve hate and it may end up ruining your career. Dating When your a kpop idol you barely have any free time. You dont get much of a personal life cause you are constantly practicing and doing concerts and such. Alot of agencies ban dating for their idols because they do not want them to get side tracked and only focus on their career. Idols want to be a perfect role model so dating is out of the question. It is sad, and plus they are also too busy to even think about it. Alot of kpop idols probably date in secret cause also if anyone publically dated it would only result in hate and they would be forced to break up. (Kai and Jennie for example) Alot of agencies actually block them from the opposite sex to make sure feelings dont appear. Boy kpop groups admitted that alot of the female kpops are blocked whenver they pass each other by their managers, they cant even associate with them. i find that really sad but I mean they signed up for it but I think they should still be allowed to hang out with other groups even if their the opposite gender! Mental Health After Shinee member Jong-hyuns suicide in 2017, alot of people are concerned about their mental health and their well being of kpop stars. Idols work gruesome hours on little food and sleepm plus endure alot of stress from the public, Jong-hyungs suicide note also read \u201cI was broken inside. The depression slowly chipped me away, devouring me\u2026Troubling thoughts flooded my head. I never got the chance to learn how to change dull pain into pure joy\u201d Alot of stars train very young so the stress is even worse on younger people. Alot of idols admit that they struggle with mental health and depression and its really sad. Agencies should be kinder toward their groups and make sure they are healthy. That was a super long post, probably the longest I have ever wrote but I really want to get the message across so we can really admire and give all kpop idols support and love, because truly they hide alot of this stuff but they go through it and they shouldnt! They work so hard to bring happiness to us and all they want is to make us viewers happy! I hope we can not shame and break down idols but bring them endless love and support:) ",
