            "answer_text": "Barring any physical limitations (muteness, for example, though that is purely speculative), anyone can learn to sing. It is like running. Most people can train to do a 5k. Whether you will win or qualify for Olympic trials is a different story. But you can learn to run. I was terrible. I joined a choir in high school to get art credit required to graduate, and they only let me on because they needed more guys with deep voices. But I was very bad.  I always tried to sing like I would see opera singers do: very loudly, with an intense vibrato (where your voice \"vibrates\"), making very entertaining faces and extending my arms dramatically.  This is all to say: I couldn't sing.  With daily practice, a lot of failure and some very kind and patient people who taught me what the notes on a paper mean and how I can use that to know what the heck to sing, I got much better.  I learned to follow along with songs and match the notes that were sung by the other basses, so even if I forgot my part I could contribute. I learned to control how loud I sang according to the conductors direction. I even learned some basic note reading so I could know if the note was a little higher than the last note, that means my voice should go up a note also (I got into classical music afterwards and learn how to actually read music, but it was very basic at the time).  After about 9 months I was able to add value to the group and that felt good. And I continue to improve. I loved it so much I volunteered for a second year though I didn't need to.  Like a muscle, though, after high school I stopped working it out. Within 4 years or so I felt I didn't \"have it\" anymore. By 6 years out I finally reached a point where I was singing along to a song  and found that I could not get my voice to match the notes correctly or follow the rhythm.  With much sadness, I admitted to myself that I could no  longer sing.  One day I may join a church choir for fun and try to train my voice again, just like most people talk about wanting to get in shape, but take years before they actually do it.  ",

            "answer_text": "I have a tonal disability. I took a test a few years ago, and discovered that the same note sounds different in my two ears. This fact suddenly explained to me why I have always had difficulty in singing! (A few percent of all adults have this challenge.) I've recently read that everyone has this to some degree; it's like the same color appears red in one eye but green in the other. The technical name for this condition is diplacusis. Some people experience a sudden onset as a result of illness, but most people are born with some level. It is readily explained by the fact that if the two ears are not identical, then minor differences in the cochleae send the same tone to different parts of the brain. It is not true that one is right and the other is wrong. Either one works fine. If you listen only in one ear, then you have no problem. Everything sounds right. (But listening in only one ear makes it harder to sing too.)  Yet I love classical music. I can often recognize the composer from a single chord (especially Beethoven and Wagner, who excelled in chords). I do it from the perceived \"texture\". But I have great difficulty carrying a tune. A music professor friend, Rudy Saltzer, took me on as a challenge. He spent many hours teaching me to sing. (In return, I taught him how to use a computer.) He gave me one of the greatest gifts that any friend has ever given me: as a result of his teaching, my children would no longer stop when I joined them in singing a Christmas Carol.  But I know my limits.  I do best when singing along with others; I can sense the \"beats\" when I am off pitch, and adjust.  I have a good voice. But the fact that I hear different tones in my two ears presents a real challenge. I can not sing well a cappella.  Anybody can do physics. Can anybody become a great physicist?  I doubt it. Unless you have talent in abstract thinking, it is hard to compete with those who do. Anybody can become a basketball player. Can anyone become a great basketball player? I doubt it. Unless you have the natural muscular coordination (and maybe the height) it is hard to compete with those who do. Anybody can sing. Can anyone become a great singer? I doubt it. Unless you have the natural ability to hear the difference between tones, it is hard to compete with those who do. But anyone, even me, can get good enough at singing that their children will not refuse to sing along.  Thank you Rudy. ",

            "answer_text": " Anyone without physical defects in hearing can learn to sing reasonably well.  The best way to think of it is like any other instrument.  You need to train your ear and your muscle memory to work together, so that you clearly hear the sounds mentally and can bring them forth on your instrument.   I think fretless instruments like the violin provide the clearest analog. If you haven't trained your fingers exactly where to go, and can't hear when you're right or wrong, then it's going to sound awful.  We can see our fingers and are used to the idea that there is a physical place that is right and wrong, so we easily grasp that we just need to learn the right places to put our  fingers.  Since our voice can't be seen, it seems more abstract and the ability to sing seems mysterious and magical.  It's harder to understand that our voice just needs to physically and mentally be trained where to go (especially when most people are told from a young age that you either just have it or you don't).    Most people who are 'good singers' just happened to have a bit of aptitude for it and got some encouragement as children so they developed their ability without much effort.  Most people who don't display an aptitude as a child are told 'you can't sing' and they just accept that and stop, and never develop their ability. If you understand that singing is a physical activity just like playing the cello or trumpet it helps get you past the false belief that it's this enigmatic ability.   That said, the timbre of people's voices varies a lot, and there is a lot of stuff that goes into singing well.  Even a good singer might have a voice that not everyone  will enjoy.    ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone who can speak can learn to use a singing voice, but not everyone will have a fabulous-sounding voice. Once the vocal instrument is working, the ability to sing with good intonation is dependent on musical aptitude and musical achievement.\u201d No matter your age, voice lessons are also an option. Anyone can learn to sing. Your unique voice can be called as a gift but singing is an art which anyone can learn. One can improve one's singing through continuous practice. Whether a great voice is actually genetic, or at least partially the product of environment, doesn't matter to anyone old enough to ask this question. The more important part of the answer is that singing can be learned, as an adult, and a person can become a thoroughly passable singer at almost any time of life. Developing Your Voice: Get voice training regularly. One major way to become a better singer is to have vocal training. Know your range. Focus on your breath. Learn proper singing posture. Warm ups make your singing sound better, relax and prepare your body and vocal chords and enhance your performance!! About 5 to 10 minutes of warm-up is ideal before singing. When I was both in choir, and in singing as a hobby, I would warm up for about 5 minutes before practicing.Warm up before you sing. Learn to recognize pitch. Practice singing daily. Take an easy breath in and exhale while saying \u201chum\u201d. Begin with the nasal sound /m/ and gently glide from a high to a low pitch as if you were sighing. Don't forget your vocal cool down after extensive vocal use. Gently humming feeling the focus of the sound on the lips is an excellent way to cool down the voice.  ",

Also took lessons in classical music for a year or so; I was \"first\" soprano at one point. My proudest moment was being chosen to break off from the group during one of the arrangements and sing a higher pitch of the melody.   I somehow got through all of that and not a lot of the music theory stuff stuck...maybe I'm hard on myself though. I can't do a decent sight read is what I mean by not being able to read notes.  I can't rap, though. Rapping...I don't do.[1]  PS Cecila Bartoli is my idol...she has a voice from the heavens...now she can really sing!   The goddess herself singing Se Tu M'ami (the last song I whispered out in comparison...her voice has incredible depth and power):  The lowest range I can sing reliably is...about O ccesate di piagarmi. Ah, it looks like Ms. Bartoli also does a rendition    God, her voice is perfection.    My voice more pop-esque...I can best imitate either  Emmy Rossum:    Or Kelly Sweet    [1] Except for the rap in Lasers by Lupe Fiasco starting at 0:54 here:    As an ending note, I would still sing loudly even if I were tone deaf. My sister loves to sing and is tone deaf, but she sings to her deaf kitty every day. :) It's a mode of self-expression, and it's one of the deepest forms if you ask me, and so there should be no shame in connecting with yourself that way (if you are tone deaf or even if you're not).

To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau\u2019s famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize that only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau\u2019s, who is, in this critic\u2019s opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau\u2019s soon, hungry for more.\u201d \u2014 Ratatouille (2007) I am a trained musician, and I believe that not anyone can sing. Singers may come from all walks of life, and come from the most unexpected places, but not just anyone can do it. As in basketball or leading an army or swimming, some people are born with God\u2019s gift to do one thing, whether it\u2019s to be tall, have webbing of the hands, or a tenor who can hit C5. What is so often overlooked is need to have desire, passion and innate talent overlap. Passion can be controlled, be aimed, such that it overlaps with desire or talent. It is rare and an enviable trait such that all three are incident to each other, and that\u2019s where genius is born. ",

Can you do this with a single 10-20 hour practice session? Absolutely not. Habits take at least a few weeks, usually several months to build.  Not every voice teacher will be able to help someone go from \"bad\" to \"good\". Some voice teachers had a great head start as singers and essentially skipped what needs to be learned for someone who may not know how to match pitch. When I first started singing, I could not match pitch and worked with teachers who never knew what that was like, so some were helpful and some were not. So now as a voice teacher I have worked with many many people who have learned how to sing and make the types of sounds they like.

Someone who sings in the shower or with their kids would not enjoy that spotlight.

Personally I have damaged my right ear-drum while trying to kill a mosquito in half asleep. I can hear only around 85-90%(assuming) lesser than what I hear through left ear. Both my ears dont hear equally but I do not hear differently. However I dont consider this to be a major challenge(unless you anybody has a very wide degree of tonal disability) when it comes to singing. Ability to sing depends on technique like singing in different pitch(even within same octave will do) and singing with proper timing which is rhythm. If you know little bit of pitch and rhythm, then will little practice anybody should be able to sing. In this assumption I would want to exclude anybody who cannot produce sound more than 1 pitch due to vocal damage or disability. In your case you might want to start singing simple songs like Nursery Rhymes and tap your feet to get proper beat. I have not personally experience two different sounds listening to same note(not that I could recognized) even though I hear it louder and softer in both the ears. If you hear two different sounds for both the ears, you might want to sing with one ear covered and practice this with both the ears. Let us hear if this works for you and could overcome your challenge? Nothing is impossible. All the best. ",

However there are many people who claim to be tone-deaf who are not. I have taught singing students who had that claim who have learned over a period of time and through practice to be able to match pitch. I find that it is often the case that a person can sing a cappella and stay in key and then when they have to sing to a piano, guitar, or radio they are tone-deaf. When that is the case it takes practice and some help from a voice teacher to help that person learn to match their voice to the piano, guitar, etc. ",

And \"singing\" is based on that ability. It's like a language that the person has never heard or learned.  Also singing always takes place within a certain cultural mindscape. Someone may be able to sing Italian opera, or early rock n' roll, but not Peking Opera, or Eskimo throat singing.   But there is a great vocal activity called \"sounding\" - it includes singing, but there are many other ways of sounding. Think of what people working physically often do, especially in less-\"developed\" parts of the world - calling, hollering, whispering, shouting, hooting.... fishermen/women, diggers, planters, hunters.... and how such peoples use their voices in celebration rituals...

Everyone has a voice, you just need to find your voice. Some people have a gifted voice, but it doesn\u2019t mean that only those people could be good singers. If you can memorize the rhythm and music in your head then you can easily produce it too. But of course just that is not enough, you need to explore different places from where you can sing. You need to discover your range that is how low and how high you are able to sing smoothly without putting a lot of strain. Try the vocal excercises to improve your singing and one day you\u2019ll definitely see the change in yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Well anybody can sing, but whether one sings well or not is another issue. To me singing well or at least decently can be trained though. Most of the time, people who say that they are tone deaf and cannot sing in tune tend to have a mental block that prevents themselves from singing, since actual, clinical tone deafness is a rare issue. Usually, this is because they are discouraged from singing when they are younger, or they are not used to activating their inner ears to match pitches (just like one not being able to hold a guitar properly the first time they start playing it).

It may take a lot of practice but it can be done. Also, more importantly you need to be able to replicate the notes you hear. For example you hear an \"A,\" you need to be able to create the \"A\" sound (if that makes sense).  2. Learn the 'singing' techniques. There are a lot of technicalities involved here. But, just to name some, singing from the diaphragm and not from the throat, doing head tones, etc. For everything else, like all other skills, practice. Regular and consistent practice is key. ",

I dont even tune it to \"standard pitch\" because I like it to sound a bit flat (my violin sounds better at A~405hz or there off.  I knew the digit by playing against the tuner but I don't deliberately tune to that pitch.  I'd only tune-up to suit the rest if I'm playing in a group).    I dont know if I'm accusing others of tone-deafness more than I should because a slight pitch off sounded off (I'm comparing it to the melody in question ~ and yes it is possible that some old tunes, especially historical ones do not actually follow the piano-intervals) when many would think it sounded the same.

I would have to breakdown your question and say that you can teach technique but cannot teach the innate ability to carry a tune. Im not saying it's impossible to learn to stay on key. It's my experience that anyone can vocalize if they are willing to put in the work. Every person is gifted with some ability and strength in some area of their life. Even as a vocalist I find it curious that folks put so much weight on singing. Art is alive in everyone if you look close enough. ",
