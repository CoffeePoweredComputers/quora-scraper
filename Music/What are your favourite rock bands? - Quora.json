            "answer_text": "1. The Beatles for wonderful, timeless melodies and wonderful songwriting and lyrics. Watch out for George Harrison's wonderful guitar work too. 2. The Rolling Stones for blues-based rockers. Mick Jagger has a wonderful voice (and is an extraordinary dancer, though that doesn't count). Keith Richards is exquisite. 3. Led Zeppelin for power blues, a genre they virtually invented. This may be the most powerful group of musically talented individuals that ever walked on the planet. Jimmy Page is a personal favourite. 4. Pink Floyd, sometimes defined as art rock. They were, I once was telling a friend why I liked them and ended up describing them as artists instead of just musicians. Best studio records any band will ever produce. 5. Cream, Derek and the Dominoes, specifically they feature Eric Clapton who is a personal hero. Cream was the first power group in rock music and was a fusion band of blues, rock and jazz which is what makes it so special. That, and the extended, improvised jams in concerts. Derek and the Dominoes is a fairly short-lived band but their live album is truly exceptional. They also produced the timeless rock anthem, Layla. 6. The Allman Brothers Band who I like primarily for Duane Allman. A remarkable feature of this six-man group was that it featured two lead guitarists (Duane and Dicky Betts, both wonderful) standing toe-to-toe and two men on percussion instruments. Their live album, At Filmore East, is considered the best live album on vinyl and is truly mesmerising. The band is primarily blues-based Southern rock. 7. Black Sabbath for hard rock. Both their frontmen, Ozzy Osbourne and Ronnie James Dio were very good. Paranoid was a groundbreaking album. Besides these, I also like AC/DC, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Iron Maiden, Bad Company, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Guns n' Roses and some minor bands. To be honest, these aren't as good as in the list. Who's missing? Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Who, The Doors, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jeff Beck, Lynyrd Skynyrd are some of the bands I have yet to listen to thoroughly, so I do not think I am qualified to make a judgement. In case you want honest and extensive opinions on bands and albums, this is a good site for reviews on rock and blues albums :George Starostin's Music Reviews Ps: No particular order. ",

            "answer_text": "I am the son of an oldies DJ Dad and an audiophile mother. I love rock music! That being said here are some rock artists I enjoy\u2026 Bill Haley and the Comets, way better than those Crickets everybody is always talking about in my opinion! Since this is a REALLY old band just grab what you can find and enjoy a bygone era. The Guess Who, everyone always talks about The Who but I prefer these guys, always have. Tommy was cool but American Woman\u2026 come on! Another oldie but goodie CD scavenger hunt\u2026 Have fun! Jan and Dean. These clown princes of rock and roll wrote the songs that The Who used to trash hotel rooms too, Honolulu Lulu to be exact. Listen to the arrangements for the true genius and read the liner notes for the true comedy! Grab a box set and enjoy the history of surf rock you never learned in school. I will add the Beach Boys as a footnote here since the two groups go hand in hand in many ways, grab Pet Sounds (the one with mono AND stereo tracks) for the full education. Want to go full California Surf? Add in some Sandy Nelson (got kicked out of Jan and Dean for being too loud on the drums!) and Dick Dale for some instrument specific education. Throw in the Ventures and you\u2019re good to go! Queen, need I say more? Didn\u2019t think so. Pixies, yes a bit of a jump chronologically but when I first heard them I knew what love was. This is also one of the first bands I discovered on my own without my parents. Nirvana gets a lot of credit but when Kurt Cobain said all he wanted was to be in a Pixies cover band\u2026 I think that says something! The greatest hits album will get you the education I think you need and as they scream in UMass\u2026 IT\u2019S EDUCATIONAL! Mana. Mexican rock at its finest! My money is on the Suenos Liquidos album or the MTV Unplugged if you want to go acoustic. Rammstein. German Industrial Hardcore by definition and yet some of their songs venture into pop. Something about the German language just makes feelings sound so much more raw and intense! Any album is going to be good but the Made In Germany greatest hits is an excellent introduction to them. Some notable mentions: Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Lzy (Polish alt rock band) Elastica, Arctic Monkeys, Disturbed, Evanescence, Lacuna Coil, HIM, MacKeel (from the Canadian Maritime, they only had ONE album but my god what they did to that genre was amazing!) Primus (that bass!) Screaming Trees, System of a Down, Live, Genesis, Meatloaf\u2026 You get the idea. Rock on! \\m/ ",
