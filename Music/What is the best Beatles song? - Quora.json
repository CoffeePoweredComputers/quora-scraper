            "answer_text": "Objectively, from a psychological perspective, the best Beatles song would be - \u201cNowhere Man\u201d. Lyrics taken from the song: \u201cHe\u2019s as blind as he can be, just sees what he wants to see\u201d. This is so true, and represents a major concept in Psychology as described by the Cognitive Dissonance Theory. This is also brought out in \u201cThe Boxer\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel, \u201cStill a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest\u201d. From a Freudian point of view, people see things based on early childhood experiences. And in animals, it is known as Imprinting. But what\u2019s the difference. Well, you could say animals have more of a knee jerk type reflex reaction to stimuli, whereas people analyze input before they react. But the point is: human/animal behavior is based on past experiences and learning, which then influences an individual\u2019s perspective. And this perspective is explained in the Cognitive Dissonance Theory: in order to reduce stress you will only see (or want to hear) things that relieve anxiety, conform to your past experiences, and promote a sense of well being. Which then implies you are not very receptive to new ideas. Or to be more specific in a political sense, also known as conservative Right Wing Religious Republicans that voted against Stem Cell research. In other words, interfering with the Handiwork of God created anxiety and only allowed them to \u201csee what they want to see\u201d based on their past/current religious indoctrination. Which then caused them to disregard the benefits. But oddly, Nancy Reagan was in favor of this research. She could see what they were blinded to see, blinded by their religion. And subjected to their emotions caused by their Cognitive Dissonance. See Cognitive dissonance - Wikipedia In summary: whether it\u2019s the Beatles or so many other groups of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, these song writers were probably the best. And currently not many song writers are that creative, knowledgeable, or come close to the insightful lyrics of past generations. Not only that, but the background music never interfered with listening to the hallucinogenic type lyrics that could take you down the Rabbit Hole of the Surreal. And the lyrics were so clear and easy to understand. Basically, poetry set to all sorts of different melodies/rhythms . And the Beatles were clearly the best. So to answer your question, but with less objectivity and more from an emotional point of view\u2026\u2026, all Beatles songs were the best. ",

            "answer_text": "The Beatles wrote 213 songs, so let's just preface this response by saying there is no way in the world that anyone who knows and loves the Beatles could ever name just one. There are also hundreds upon hundreds of books, lists, articles, blogs, interviews forums like this one that endeavored to answer this unanswerable question. We really shouldn't do this. But, for the sake of the exercise, let's try. All My Loving. This was the song that millions of people first heard the Beatles play live, immediately after Ed Sullivan introduced them to the American viewing audience for the first time with the immortal \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, The Beatles!\u201d I still get goosebumps every time I hear that line, followed by Paul's count off over the screams of countless fans and \u201cClose your eyes and I'll kiss you\u2026\u201d and the double-time guitar\u2026it is a perfect, polished song and for many, indelibly etched in our memories and inseparable from that iconic moment. It may not be their best song, but it is the one that brought them into our collective consciousness. A Day In the Life. It's the most important song on their most important record. It's two songs in one. It's cinematic. It's psychedelic. It's epic It's literate. It's historic. It's John. It's Paul. It\u2019s coincidental (Mal's alarm clock anyone?) It's perfect. \u201cHe blew his mind out in a car\u2026\u201d goosebumps every time. It's most likely their best song. Something. It wasn't written by John or Paul. It was Frank Sinatra's favorite Beatles song (he covered it) and it is epic, intimate, quintessentially Beatles. Listen to it. Listen to it in headphones. Listen to the lead guitar part. Listen to the drum rolls. Listen to George's lilting voice. You'll never see or hear the world the same way again. Goosebumps. It is my favorite Beatles song. Eleanor Rigby. Bill Clinton made me think about this song differently when he called it his favorite Beatles song and \u201cthe most powerful song he ever heard.\u201d Yesterday. A perfect song in every way. There's nothing more about it I can say. Oh, I believe in Yesterday. All You Need is Love? Hey Jude? Strawberry Fields? Two of Us? In My Life? Come Together? I'll leave it to you to decide. ",
