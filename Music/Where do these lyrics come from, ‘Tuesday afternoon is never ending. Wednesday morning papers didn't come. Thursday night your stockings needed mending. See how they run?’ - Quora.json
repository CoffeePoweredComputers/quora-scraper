            "answer_text": "Those lyrics are from a song called Lady Madonna by The Beatles. It was written back in 1968. Although credited to Lennon-McCartney the music was written by McCartney and most of the lyrics. Lennon did add to the lyrics but not much. It was released as a single with The Inner Lights as the B side. The Inner Lights itself is a bit of a history being the first Harrison song recorded by the band and released as a single. On the album The Beatles also known as the White Album Lady Madonna did not appear. Lennon did not like the song. On the Deluxe version and on the 50 year version you have the song as one of the add-ons. ",
