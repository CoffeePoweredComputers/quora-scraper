            "answer_text": "Critically! What I mean, is listening and at same time trying to understand everything you are hearing, technically, and musically. On technical front, detecting all the instruments, their panning, tone, effects. Also trying to detect how certain sounds were achieved. Especially important in EDM, since such music is full of sound design techniques, so listening for filter cutoff sweeps, comb filter sweeps, fast/slow attack on envelopes, etc, etc. On musical side, listening for melody and use of unison and octaves, key changes, degree of diatonic sound vs more \u201coutside\u201d sounding, chord progressions (especially by listening to bass), for syncopation among instruments, figuring out what is constituting the groove, determining basic form. Listening for use of other instruments contributing to melody, so strings, woodwinds or something in background playing counter melodies, etc. Listening for harmony in vocals and detecting basic essence, are they singing in thirds, fourths, sixths? This is why audio enginering and producing complement one another. A producer isn\u2019t someone who just thinks at high level, like, \u201cI want a big sound here!\u201d, but instead is technically and musically skilled so as to know how to turn a vision into a realization. Music is one of those areas where non technical and non musical managers/producers bring absolutely nothing to the table\u2026 Brian Free Guitar Lessons - Guitar Dreams ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to listening to the song, we analyse it too. This is helpful as it helps us understand trends and what makes a song good. I hear every element, note, relative pitch, sound, synth and everything going on to the point that I could recreate the song one month later if I wanted to but I would only do such a thing for a lesson or demonstration. As producers, we know exactly what is going on. Well the good ones anyway. ",
