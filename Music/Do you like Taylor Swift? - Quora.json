            "answer_text": "Nope. I was never a fan of Taylor Swift and never will be. Her overuse of the victim card / painting herself as an underdog Since the very beginning, Taylor (and her publicists) has painted a girl-next-door image for her. \u201cOur song\u201d also portrays a false image of Taylor \u2014 that she is merely a country girl who got discovered and is finally able to live a lavish lifestyle. Like a lot of country singers \u2013 that\u2019s how she first broke in \u2013 Taylor Swift grew up on a farm. It wasn\u2019t a subsistence farm in the rough part of Kentucky but a Christmas-tree farm in Pennsylvania. \u201cHer mother worked in finance,\u201d a New Yorker story says, \u201cand her father, a descendant of three generations of bank presidents, is a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. (He bought the tree farm from a client.)\u201d \u201cWhen she was ten, her mother began driving her around on weekends to sing at karaoke competitions. Then she persuaded her mother to take her to Nashville during spring break to drop off her karaoke demo tapes around Music Row, in search of a record deal; they didn\u2019t succeed, but the experience convinced Swift that she needed a way to stand out.\u201d When Swift was 14, her father relocated to Merrill Lynch\u2019s Nashville office as a way to help dear Taylor break into country music. As a sophomore in high school, she got a convertible Lexus. Around the same time, her dad bought a piece of Big Machine, the label to which Swift signed. Sure, Taylor\u2019s privilege upbringing does not negate her talent and hard work. However, one has to admit that it is deceitful of Taylor to portray herself as an underdog. In interviews, she often says she had to overcome a lot to get to where she is today. Meanwhile, there are countless talented artists who have had to face incomparable obstacles just to release an album; and they may never get to the same level of stardom as Taylor, due to their lack of privilege. It would be great if Taylor would acknowledge her privilege as opposed to playing the role of an underdog when she clearly does not fit the bill. White feminism White feminism is defined as a form of feminism that focus on the struggles of well-off white women while failing to address the distinct forms of oppression faced by women of colour and women lacking other privileges. [1] Taylor is so caught up in her white privilege that she can't even consider that there are any other perspectives. She is often regarded as a positive role model for young girls, but instead of teaching girls and women valuable lessons, she constantly perpetuates several archaic values. In addition, she regards feminism as a synonym for equality and talks about the double standards women face in today\u2019s society, both of which are indeed valid concerns. However, she does not acknowledge feminism as a whole, feminism as a multifaceted concept, feminism for nonwhite/successful/traditionally attractive women. Personally, I feel that she is jumping on the feminism bandwagon, making sure to portray herself as a . Case in point? Her very public twitter feud with Nicki Minaj. Nicki was simply noting how black women are hardly ever recognized in the music industry, even though they are significant influences on pop culture. She also called out the fact that winning videos always feature \"women with very slim bodies.\" Instead of recognizing the heart of her comments, Swift jumped in and accused Minaj of pitting women against each other. Drama with other celebrities I will not go into details but I\u2019ve added links to articles detailing her feuds with Kanye West and Katy Perry. (Releasing her albums back on Spotify on the same day when Katy\u2019s new album drops? Her conflicting and ever-changing stance on streaming services? Someone remind me is Taylor 27 or 7. Her very public, high profile relationships with male celebrities, most notably Tom Hiddleston in 2016. Does anyone truly believes that their relationship was anything but a publicity stunt? No-one can deny that they wanted to be seen and photographed together \u2014 nobody goes on a date to the Colosseum in an effort to avoid crowds. The \u201cI heart T.S.\u201d shirt Tom wore? Absolutely ridiculous. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, I like her enough and I've never liked her music, so me liking her is apparently strange. I found her music fine. In one ear, out the other kinda thing. None if them suck to me in any substantial way, but most were harmless (except We Are Never Getting Back Together. That song can burn in a fire, I despise it so much). She sings about what she knows, and what she knows is breakups. She had managed to build an entire look and career talking about maybe one or two things. She's got to be doing something right. But now it's become popular to hate her. Maybe because she's arrogant, little mean spirited, catty, the like, but I really don't care. She's far less so than like, half the entertainer industry. She made a song against Katy Perry? Who cares. She didn't even call her a slut in it (I'm not saying you should. What I'm saying is the chorus is \u201cbaby now we got bad blood\". Truly the most cutting and hateful statements. Woo) . That was the most passive \u201cdiss song\" I have ever heard. Song doesn't even say her name in it.It's what her fans want. They want her to continue talking about boys, and complaining about people that hurt her. It makes too much money. I can't get mad at a girl for giving her fans what they want. She has tapped into the most financially successful demographic to appeal to in a time where you can get music for free. And she still sells albums. I can't hate a girl for that. I respect that. If it wasn't working, I'm sure she'd try something new.And I think that last point is it. I feel like if what she was doing wasn't working, she would change it. This all a look for her. And maybe making a persona for the fans makes it easier for you to take it off and be a normal person at home. I don't know. I don't care enough about Taylor swift to break down her mental health.And as for the people saying she's sending sexist messages and whatnot\u2026i mean I guess? I can see that angle if you already don't like the song. But I feel like that song about how she wears t-shirts and whatever isn't set up to do that. It's to help out those girls that are young and don't feel very attractive. And I get it, you don't need to bring another woman down to bring yourself up, but it's not her job to teach that lesson. It's kinda the stance about Meghan Trainors all about that base. I understand all the hoopla, but at the end of the day, it's a song meant to cheer up heavy set girls in a world where they don't get a lot of those. This was the same. One could say it was done poorly, and I could agree with you, but no more than that. At the end of the day, I'm cool with Taylor swift. I feel like if it wasn't so popular to hate her, I might not be as forgiving, but she seems cool enough. She seems to keep to herself for the most part. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. First of all, I have to give context. My angsty teenager phase can be summed up in: \u201cNobody understands me\u201d\u201cI know everything and everyone around me is stupid\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just wait until I find that perfect someone\u201dSelf-diagnosed depression and overall extreme pessimismAt the time, there was no absolutely way in hell that I could enjoy her music. I was so disgusted with what I considered mainstream at the time that anything even slightly associated with mainstream would go straight into my blacklist. No questions asked. So no, I did not love Taylor Swift nor her music. Fast-forward to my first year of college, and like any storm, my angsty teenager phase passed. Now kicked in my \u201ceverything is sunshine\u201d phase. It\u2019s the first year of college. I\u2019m excited. Everything is new, shiny, and beautiful. Imagine that feeling of getting the video game/console you always wanted (for me it was the Wii) and unboxing. I just couldn\u2019t wait. This was the complete polar opposite of my angsty teenage phase. I was optimistic for once. Considering that I had been an introvert for most of high school, seeing that I was was forced to go out of my comfort zone to meet a whole bunch of new students like me was fun. \u201cHere was to new beginnings,\u201d I said to myself. \u2026 One day in October, my floor had an open door night. With this, a bundle of explosive energy entered my dorm room that I shared with my amazing roommate Austin. This was the beginning of my absolute adoration for Taylor Swift\u2019s music. This bundle of explosive energy\u2019s catchphrase was, \u201cJust be nice.\u201d It was something she really embodied. Everyday, she would barge into my room self-invited. We would always be greeted with a warm hug, following with the question of, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d She would always listen intently. Not with the insincere overeagerness of some. She would just listen. That was one of her gifts to us. \u2026 Getting to know her better throughout the year, I found that she loved lots of things, but there were four that really stuck with me: DisneyTaylor SwiftDogsBakingHer passions were made well known and clear. She would radiate with so much enthusiasm for her passions. It was just contagious. In the words of Jim Rohn, I found myself to be \u201cthe average of five of the people [I] spent the most time with.\u201d She infected me with the Rosie. \u2026 The Rosie spawned my love for Taylor Swift\u2019s song. To my surprise, her music was pretty relatable. The melody was catchy, the lyrics were easy to remember and follow along with, and experiences were general enough that most people could relate it to some kind of memory. I think the reason why I love Taylor Swift\u2019s music is because it takes me back. I\u2019m reminded of my AP Euro and AP US classes where my powerlifting cat loving teacher would jam out to I Knew You Were Trouble. I\u2019m reminded of the things that were out of my control that nearly ended my relationship with Girlfriend in the cold and loneliness of winter through Mine and December. I\u2019m reminded of all of the spontaneous midnight dance parties in my dorm room where my college fam would dance to Shake It Off on full blast. I\u2019m reminded of the times I would watch Taylor Swift music videos late into the night with Rosie, from Love Story to Wildest Dreams. I\u2019m reminded of the time I butchered You Belong with Me on the cruise ship game show and the whole crowd of teenage girls gave me a standing ovation. I\u2019m reminded of the time when my parents would discuss the internal family feuds and I would break out into Bad Blood. And of course, I\u2019m reminded my amazing friend Rosie. \u2026 Taylor Swift\u2019s music is associated with so many of my memories. It\u2019s sentimental and it\u2019s nostalgic. I\u2019m sure people who love Taylor Swift\u2019s music can attest to this. Also, how could I not love her? In the words of Rosie, \u201cshe is just goals.\u201d *Cue in the hair flip* ",

            "answer_text": "ok, lets start with music. what i find with most pop music is that there is no meaning behind the lyrics, no emotion in the songs, and there are like 20 co-writers for a single song. with taylor, this is not the case. example: blank space. at first, it sounds like some generic pop song, but its not. the song is written only by Taylor, max martin and shellback, but it was mostly taylor, fyi. the song is written from the perspective of what the media portrays her as. the media portrayed her as some crazy serial dater, so she wrote a song from the perspective of a crazy serial dater to show the media how outrageous she would be if she was actually like that. i feel that you can really sense the emotion behind every line of every one of her songs, because she puts her all into each song, unlike alot of musicians. next, fan interactions you physically cannot buy meet and greet tickets for taylor swift, she gives them to people for free. if you go to one of her shows, her management team will be looking for people who are dancing and singing louder than everyone else and invite them to meet taylor backstage. taylor has also given her fans money to help with medical bills and other financial issues, and she doesn\u2019t say anything about this on her social media. she just genuinely wants to make a difference, but she doesn\u2019t go around advertising it. she made a name for herself many pop musicians, (ariana grande, miley cyrus, etc.) had family members already involved in the music industry, which gave them a very easy backdoor into the industry. taylor, however, made a name for herself. she spent every weekend at cafes trying to get noticed by record labels, and when she finally signed with big machine, she was the only one who was signed. she started from nothing, and is now one of the biggest names in the industry.

            "answer_text": "Not really. I used to think she was okay; I really liked Love Story and her other older songs. But I think she\u2019s become too much of a conformist in the musical sense, even though she justifies this as her trying new things. She also often picks fights with other celebrities and seems like a very insecure person, even though I can\u2019t say because I don\u2019t know her in real life. Maybe she\u2019s just doing it for the publicity. I just think she\u2019s a bit of an attention seeker. She sort of uses her songs as a medium to vent about her failed relationships and emotional wounds, but it\u2019s not conveyed in a unique or moving way to me. Her songs don\u2019t express sorrow or pain, they express pettiness. Sure, she donates to charity, but I mean if you\u2019re sitting on millions, I think you wouldn\u2019t be a human being if you didn\u2019t feel guilty at all that you were so far up the monetary hierarchy just for singing songs. If I were her, I\u2019d live in a small apartment and give away all my money, I would try to make more of a positive social difference because I actually do have a lot of power. Yes, no one is expected to give to charity, and I certainly respect that she does, but I still don\u2019t think it sets her off from others. Here\u2019s some statistics: Her net worth is $250 million, and the most I\u2019ve heard is that she\u2019s donated $1 million to some Flood Relief program. Maybe there\u2019s more, but the point is that even $1 million can pretty much guarantee anyone a financially secure and happy existence for the rest of their life. What is she doing with that $240+ million?  Source: TheRichest - The World's Most Entertaining Site Yeah, she earned it. But does she deserve it? I think not. ",

            "answer_text": "Her music: Her songs are absolutely amazing! Her music is filled with beautiful lyrics, magical vocals and meaningful messages that younger listeners (maybe even older) can take with them through their lives. She sings about things that most people can relate to and I feel a very strong connection to her music. Her music perfectly describes her emotions and many different situations. She might sing about an excruciating breakup, a crazy, insane relationship, the joyous tale of a love she had with a boy, her family or her friends. She could sing the words on an intruction manual and it would still sound incredible! Whether she's singing one of her beautiful country songs with her guitar or she's singing one of her cool pop songs with a great beat, her lyrics, her voice, everything is just flawless. In short, Taylor Swift's music will take you on an emotional journey Great role model:I don't even know where to start! She doesn't speak bad words, kids love her, she visits children hospitals, her lyrics are meaningful, she doesn't act like Miley, etc the list goes on and on and on! She's friends with different celebrities and not just Selena. And in her songs there is always a secret message, you just have to listen carefully. She gives great advice and spends time with her cat, Meredith, has time for her band and her real best friend, Abigail. She teaches kids that not everything in life is pure gold. You have to work up to your dreams to accomplish it . Everything takes effort. Plus, she doesn't rub it in to everyone that she owns three houses and has more fans. Oh, and one more thing, she doesn't mind throwing fund raisers! She is so pretty :She looks really beautiful . I'm a guy from India. I started listening English songs at the age of 14 only because of tay tay. Mean, 22, Everything has changed are some of my favorite songs.  She acts her age :Unlike other singers, ariana grande, she acts her age and she is equally mature and the fun-loving Tay Tay that we know and love. Tay says that she doesn't need blonde hair when she's 60. True. She is now 26, and she acts like it, not pretending to be some person that isn't her. She is a responsible human being:Taylor gives her side of being a big sister who is responsible and independent not only to her own brother also to her friends .She treats her friends like her siblings and the people who love her like family too.  Her tour and the 13 hours meet and greet :Every tour is different, with something special. She sticks to her lucky number: 13, during the meet and greet. She even extended it because there are too many fans waiting for her.  She ignores hater :One amazing thing about Taylor is she doesn't let the haters get to her. Some people think that they have the right to say horrible things about her because they don't like her, her music, her style, her hair, or whatever. They're people who just don't have anything better to do than try and make Taylor feel upset. Newsflash! She doesn't care what you say. She knows that she is talented and the bad things people say about her are not true. She just shakes it off! GO TAYLOR!  ",

            "answer_text": "YES. Sure, there are things I dislike about her, things I disagree with. But the good things weigh out the bad, for me. Lets start off with her music. I feel people only judge her most popular songs, like Shake It Off and Look What You Made Me Do. Although both songs have a powerful message, they do not portray her amazing songwriting. Some of her best written songs are: \u201cAll Too Well\u201d\u201cState of Grace\u201d\u201cFifteen\u201d\u201cMean\u201d\u201cRed\u201d\u201cBegin Again\u201d\u201cClean\u201dMany people say that Taylor only writes about break ups. Firstly, that\u2019s incorrect. She\u2019s written songs about a little boy who died (\u201cRonan\u201d), her parents (\u201cThe Best Day\u201d), her best friend (\u201cBreathe\u201d), etc. Some people will say she doesn\u2019t have a good singing voice. Now, we all know she\u2019s not as good as Mariah Carey or Ariana Grande, but she does have talent. Secondly, who cares if she only writes about her exes? It\u2019s not a bad thing. Many songwriters write about their exes. Many people say that Taylor starts drama, or picks fights with too many people. A good example of this would be her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Kanye West called Taylor to ask permission to reference her in a song. That was very responsible. But, he only said that about one part of the lyric. He never asked if he could say \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d. Taking credit for someone else\u2019s fame is unfair. I\u2019ve heard people say Taylor is a white feminist. I do not believe that is true. She spoke out about lgbtq rights at her show in Chicago. She is friends with multiple people of different races. Although it would be nice if she used her social media platform to speak out about these issues, it\u2019s not mandatory. People can love and accept minorities, even though they don\u2019t speak out about it online. Taylor Swift seems like a very kind, caring young woman. She donates to charity, she meets fans at hospitals, she even gave a private show to foster kids and their foster parents a few days before she went on tour. She could\u2019ve been resting or celebrating, but instead she chose to spend time with foster children. I would also like to point out her love for cats. It\u2019s adorable. I love Taylor Swift, and I hope she\u2019s happy with her life right now, because she deserves the world. ",

            "answer_text": "YES! Both as a fangirl and a feminist. She's a great example of a succesful woman. People that have met her say she is one of the nicest people, she's donated so much to charity, one Christmas she hand wrapped gifts for her fans, and so much more.  Just look at these two girls. I know some people don't think she's feminist enough, they bash her by calling her a \u201cwhite feminist\u201d and a \u201cserial dater\u201d. Also, the media literally calls every feminist who's white a white feminist. It's so annoying. But guess what? People in their 20\u2019s date. Get over it!  This quote says it all. Dating doesn't degrade you as a person. Having a love life doesn't degrade your worth or independence. Besides that, she's got a beautiful voice Just listen to this here song: Safe & Sound feat. The Civil Wars (The Hunger Games: Songs From District 12 And Beyond) Also, she's SUCH A GOOD SONG WRITER. Most of the time she collaborates with other writers, but she always participates and the most song writers on a song are three I believe. But just listen to this song: Taylor Swift - All Too Well (DVD The RED Tour Live) And this one: Last Kiss by Taylor Swift And this one: Taylor Swift - Out Of The Woods And if you say there are too many Taylor Swift songs about boys, here: 16 Taylor Swift Songs Not About Boys  THANK YOU TAYLOR!

Her new pop songs are catchy, sure, but there\u2019s a certain charm and innocence I associate with her older, country (ish) songs. I love her music videos. When I want a nostalgia fix, all I have to do is get on YouTube and pick a playlist from her earlier years, starting of course, with the iconic \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d.  The moment you realized that Taylor was playing both girls was the moment you grew up. Taylor Swift is a talented singer and song-writer, a kind and generous person (from what I\u2019ve seen) and an all-round successful musician who worked damn hard to get to where she is today. What\u2019s not to like? ",

I love her music so much and her personality too. She has a super melodious voice and, if you ask me, is one of the most beautiful people EVER with one of the best voices. She\u2019s super talented and not overrated at all. She completely deserves to be where she is now. Her lyrics are relatable to many people and the beats on her songs are really nice too. She is extremely grateful to her fans and knows very well that she\u2019s where she is only because of her fans. She gives as much as she can to her fans and knows what she should open up to the public about and what she should keep private.     ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, yes. I feel like people are hating on her more than she deserves. Did she get a little petty and write a song about how she disliked a former friend? Yeah, she did. But, cmon. We are ALL petty in some ways. Taylor was probably hurt, as anyone would be, or angry. She may of fueled it out in the wrong way, but that was just her bad way of venting. Taylor does write songs about her former relationships, problem? Not really. She doesn\u2019t say names, or even apply (that I\u2019m aware of) that all her songs are targeted at specific people. Her love songs got her famous, so she kept writing them. To keep her career going. Okay, there is no problem. And, they\u2019re pretty catchy lol. In my opinion, she is a strong young lady that is doing things with her life. She is living the American Dream.

She's not a vocalist at all, she can barely sing with her weak voice. Most of the time she lipsynchs her performance, and when she sings live she seldom sounds good. They make extremely decorated and coloured videos to attract people to watch her and stay focused on her. They pay lots of money to put her on top of charts even though she doesn't deserve that, and many people have noticed that. They keep talking about her on social media so people would remeber she does exist in this world. She's a mainstream artist that's why she keeps getting new fans bc people are into what mainstream is. There's too much to say, in general I don't like her. Pls swifities don't bother me with ur stupid stan talk bc that's my opinion and I'm okay with it. ",

I\u2019m generally not a fan of radio-friendly country, but once I was hipped to a few Swift tracks, I began listening to and purchasing her music. And while I don\u2019t think my experience as a musician makes my tastes any more sophisticated, I\u2019ve studied and played enough to have more than a layperson\u2019s understanding of songwriting and so on. So I\u2019m probably not the typical Swiftie. Although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to be part of The Squad, I\u2019m under the impression that she treats fans well. I am genuinely confused by the Swift-haters, as they seem to engage in a lot of conspiratorial thinking.

She loves and cares for them, and is often very kind. I\u2019m sure she is not perfect, and I bet she can be a proper cow sometimes, but her heart is in the right place. Someone as successful as her can easily turn into a monster, I don\u2019t see her as that, at all. All successful people acquire enemies, their accounts are often to be taken with a pinch of salt. They are, after all, part of a truly radioactive, reptilian world, themselves. She even honks, after a spirited performance in hot weather! Who would imagine it? And doesn\u2019t mind being told she could do with a shower, after her n-hundredth concert. I would have preferred, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a shower\u201d but I think that might easily have been misinterpreted as my wanting to take one in the same cubicle, at the same time, as Ms Swift, which, obviously, could not have been further from my mind, and would have been an utterly ridiculous distortion of my words, a quite absurd idea.

Her high-profile spongy relationships, feuds with other famous people, and massive turnaround in her latest album make me realise that she is here for the biz, not so much for the music itself. To conclude, I really like some of her songs so much that I think she deserves her multiple Grammys. She really has talents as a singer-songwriter. But personally? Not so much. Only Adele that has both professional and personal charms for me. ",

She has tailored (pun intended) her content around this phenomenon and has really garnered an enormous following of very dedicated fans because she\u2019s able to so accurately capture the emotions associated with breakups and put it into her music. This creates a bond with people since she becomes somewhat of a megaphone for their problems and puts their feelings into something tangible. ",

She has essentially sold herself as an average girl-next-door really down to earth kind of person. When in reality, she came from wealth, she lacks talent, and she is a stuck up, cold, calculating money hungry cunt who is all too willing to sue anyone who uses her music at their wedding. She lacks talent, her lyrics are dog shit, all her songs are about the same thing, her instrumentals suck, her songs never make you think or feel anything and her fan base is more toxic than Chernobyl.

Catchy but nothing that we've never heard before. Her old music was a combo of country and pop which during that time, wasn't popular yet. And she made it popular. She used to be on MySpace Music, that's where I first heard of her. This was back in early 2000s I think and the first song (and I think her very first song as well) I ever heard from her was Tim McGraw.  I was pretty much a teenager back then so I can really relate to her song lyrics. Great tunes and great combo of pop and country. And it didn't hurt that she looks pretty too.

Because its not easy. Its not easy to be this party monster and a straight A student. Get it. It needs effort. TRUE EFFORT. Every single time people try to expose her but there is nothing that strongly proves she is truly a mean girl or a drama queen or whatever they call her. Even if she is, she doesn't leave any crumbs to find her and destroy what she has built or who she is . Very squeaky clean. She is one brave and strong woman. I love her for that. ",

She has a way of connecting with her fans that most major artists don\u2019t have. And she\u2019s become very, very good at marketing the brand that is Taylor Swift. For the most part, I respect her grind. ",

When it comes to her as a person, she seems like a very nice and decent person, but when it comes to her music, I really don\u2019t understand her appeal beyond a superficial one. She is often credited with writing and creating her own music, but she wasn\u2019t the first to do so. Joni Mitchell did this years ago. While it is true that she is not a contemporary artist, her influence has been far reaching. It is doubtful that Taylor\u2019s music will be reinterpreted years from now whereas the verdict for Joni\u2019s music is in. Now I could be wrong and she could surprise all of the skeptics, but if she continues to work in the current music business I think that she will produce the same kind of music she produced in the past.

In modern times the over-hyped young popstar seem to get all the support and attention without earning it. Corporate music. This occurs to some extent even with \u201cserious\u201d musical talent. After all it is entertainment, people enjoy focusing on good looking people for hours on end. But most importantly, Ms Swift seems to be a benficiary of this model. Without the ability to sustain herself her kite will soon find itself unable to fly when the fickled winds of the teenage market no longer blow in her direction. ",

Those who criticise her are jealous of her. Maybe it's a bit rude of her to write revenge songs about her enemies but at least she is straight forward and honest and she does not like to speak rubbish behind a persons back that most of the people do. She is very down to earth and very polite with reporters and her fans unlike many celebrities. She is independent woman and an inspiration to many. ",

However, on one of the TV shows, she performed an original ballad, accompanying herself on piano, with no other musicians performing. It was beautiful, and my respect for her natural ability has remained to this day. ",

Her outfits aren\u2019t as daring as other celebrities\u2019.Catchy music. Even toddlers get into the beat of her songs!",

She could sell millions of her album in a week. Ok, enough of the praise. Let me say about why people hate her?. Firstly, Some people hate Taylor, because she sings about her ex boyfriend. That's why men are scared to date her because later on there may be a song about them. And secondly, the other group of haters are the Kanye West fans. You guys know the Kanye, Kim and Taylor drama. And also the 2009 VMA. And thirdly, the remaining haters are some of the fans of Katy Perry, Demi Lovato and other celebrities. You guys already know the fight between Katy Perry and Taylor\u2026 And recently there is rumour that, Taylor Swift is Illuminati. I don't know if it is true or not? . What do you guys think?. ",
