            "answer_text": "Quality is about consistent fitness for purpose. A $1000 guitar should be of a consistent quality with other guitars of the same model by the same manufacturer. A $100 guitar could be amazing, but 9 out of 10 will have some flaw which was not identified in the manufacturing process. You may not identify it in the shop when you try it. If it\u2019s an electric guitar, it\u2019s usually possible to replace parts until you have a \u2018perfect\u2019 instrument, especially if it has a bolt-on neck to a standard size. This means that, for $100-$400 more, you can have an instrument that plays as well as a $1000 guitar, though it will still have a budget brand on its headstock. If this bothers you, sand it off, revarnish, and put your own custom logo on it, because you will effectively have made a custom guitar. If it\u2019s an acoustic guitar, and it\u2019s not unplayable, the problem will most likely be uneven tone, and you will have to live with it. Such guitars can be great for recording to give a different voice, but they are disappointing as main instruments. I had a $200 guitar for a couple of years in the 1980s (adjusted for inflation and exchange rate), and then gave it away when I bought the guitar which stayed with me for the next 25 years. All that said, the guitar I bought in 1982 and stayed with me for 25 years was \u00a385, having previously been on sale for \u00a3350 at another shop which went bankrupt. That\u2019s a $320 purchase price in today\u2019s money, for a guitar that had been on sale for equivalent of $1500. However, instruments are usually cheaper in the USA than the UK, so let\u2019s say that my earlier guitar was $100 and my later guitar was $150 but should have been around $1000. There are always bargains of this kind to be had, especially if the guys at the local music store know you and love you. They will usually cut you extra discounts, or take you to the guitar that came in second-hand the previous day as an exchange and which is far better than its selling price would indicate, or else to the one in a thousand cheap guitar that really sounds like a $1000 guitar. My current acoustic is a Taylor costing several times more than $1,000. It\u2019s magnificent. But it isn\u2019t thousands of times better than a carefully chosen $100 guitar if you really took the time to play through every guitar in the store, and then got it professionally set up. If you\u2019re a beginner, buy a guitar which is good enough to play, and upgrade later. By then, your style will have developed and you\u2019ll know what you want. If it\u2019s a choice between tone and playability, pick playability. A badly set up guitar will develop bad habits which will be hard to break. Occasionally, I used to go to a guitar club where professional men aged 35\u201355 all played ridiculously expensive acoustic guitars. The sad truth was that very few of them could play at much more than the over-ambitious beginner level. They would take complicated parts from guitar magazines, practise them like crazy, and then play them at the club. Sometimes, two or three of them would try to play the same part on the same evening. Awkward! But as none of them had put the hours into practising the basic techniques, the result was just sloppy and without feeling. Playing a complex part badly doesn\u2019t sound any better on a Martin or Taylor than it does on a generic $100 guitar. It\u2019s easier to play a Taylor, because of the way they\u2019re set up, but that doesn\u2019t overcome inability. I would far rather invest in a guitarist with a cheap guitar who is willing to put in the hours, than one with a guitar priced like a good second-hand car who isn\u2019t willing to work. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have a $1000 guitar, but I do have $100, $300 and $3000 classical instruments. The 300 to 3000 jump is the same sort of ten-fold difference, but the difference is $2700 and that\u2019s a heck of a lot of money. I guess this demonstrates it\u2019s unwise to think of your purchases in terms of logarithms\u2026 I digress. The $100 instrument is really entry level. It can be played but it\u2019s not easy. It doesn\u2019t stay in tune, the tuners tend to bind which makes tuning difficult, the notes sound indistinct. The action\u2019s not great and the intonation is - well - inexact. The $300 instrument is nicely intonated, the action\u2019s good, it has a solid cedar top, laminated mahogany back and sides and it sounds pretty good. It\u2019s not particularly pretty but it\u2019s not ugly either. The rosette is a sticker which is coated in (I assume) polyurethane varnish. I suppose you could say the luthier put the effort into making it sound good. That\u2019s simply smart. The $3000 instrument is in a totally different league. The top is cedar, the back & sides are rosewood. It\u2019s a work of art, the marquetry is exquisite. It\u2019s sensibly perfect in every way I can see and hear. In truth, it doesn\u2019t sound 10x better but it\u2019s clearly superior to the cheaper instrument. The tone is a little richer, the tuner settles on a single note without wandering all over the place, it projects well, the back resonates in sympathy. I really doubt this instrument will ever be the limiting factor when I\u2019m playing it. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a far greater jump in the quality of sound produced by an instrument when you move from $100 to $300 than there is when you move from $300 to $1000. Finally, I\u2019m comfortable taking a $300 instrument on a camping trip to sit around the fire. If I\u2019m taking my $3000 instrument anywhere, I check the weather, temperature and humidity then I usually leave it at home. It only comes out of its case once the case is back up to temperature.
