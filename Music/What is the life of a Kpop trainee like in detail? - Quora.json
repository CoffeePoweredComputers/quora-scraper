            "answer_text": "I was a trainee at a quite small company. I will not say its name, just because of my privacy. Also, my parents don't want me to share it and I respect their opinion. I hope you understand that. I was a foreign trainee because I am from Europe (never even lived in Korea before my trainee experience). Honestly, I will tell you that the foreign trainees have harder trainee\u2019s years than Korean trainees, but that is a well-known fact by now I think. Not just because of the language border between you and everybody else around you, but because you are foreigner, they put even bigger pressure on you to fit Korean standards, not the foreign ones (basically forcing you to adapt to Korean culture) MORNING early morning My day started at 5 AM. I lived with eight more girls in a small dorm (not all of them were in the line-up of our group, we just lived together). It was really small, I can tell you that (definitely not a whole house as you can see today in many idols\u2019 vlogs which are filmed in their dorms). I slept in a room with four more girls, which was always packed with things. Every girl needs to have space for her clothes, make-up and things like that. When you put four girls in one tiny room, it is a disaster. In the whole dorm, there were only four rooms - bathroom, bedroom, kitchen with dining room and living room, where other girls slept on the couch or on a floor (they had a thin mattress like thing, I forgot how is it called, but they didn\u2019t sleep on the hard cold floor, don\u2019t worry). I went jogging every morning around the block in which we had our apartment or do some quick but intense workout - I did a lot of working out even before I went to Korea because I did athletics for a while so I worked out by doing exercises I remembered from my athletics practices. There wasn\u2019t any specific workout I would be able to tell you there (basically squads, burpees, high knees, push-ups, crunches, that bicycle thing\u2026) In the kpop industry, nobody just says: \u201eIt is okay to have one kilogram more than you should.\u201d Especially when you are in the company similar to which I was. It wasn\u2019t any famous company on the level of Cube, Starship, etc. and the CEO really had a certain vision in his head of how we should look like. Especially when you are a woman in the industry, there is way more pressure put onto you to be always skinny and good-looking than it is put onto men. That is the reason why everyone in the kpop industry has these unhealthy diets or starving because their agencies force them to look a certain way without even considering things like their height or health problems. (Finally, it is changing these days and I hope it will continue and all idols will live healthier! It hurts to watch people be insulted because of a few kilograms.) school I came back from jogging around 5:45 AM (sometimes sooner, depended on a day) and I immediately grabbed my things and went to school, which started at 6 AM for me. I had one Korean class before school every day with our Korean teacher (I went to the international school) because the company was paying her for the classes. Most of these days I didn't have time to eat breakfast, so I pick it with me to school or waited until lunch. After the Korean lesson, I normally joined my class for the day\u2019s school schedule. AFTERNOONschool Normally I was at school until 2 PM or 3 PM, depended on the day as we had different classes every day and some of them lasted longer than the others. Normally kids stayed for after school studying, but that wasn\u2019t my case. The school was basically the only place, where I felt like a normal student and kid again, enjoying my childhood with the rest of the class, doing silly things just as you do with your friends. In breaks between classes, I was chatting with my classmates about movies I have seen, groups I was listening to, cracking jokes, listened to music, etc. For me, it was the place, where I was looking forward to going every day. No student would say that about school\u2026 Right? I was lucky if I finished earlier because I could do my homework and study for the next day and don't do that at night, between my company schedules or in the morning. The Korean education system is really tough. You are basically nothing in Korea for your parents and society if you drop out of school or fail in the final exams. If you think parents are strict on you when it comes to school, try to go to Korea for a month. Students study till late night hours or spend the whole afternoon in library, or in after-school academy studying or doing homework/essays. That\u2019s why every Korean student is so shocked when they watch some American school vlog and envy the free atmosphere. So I sat with my friends in the library or classroom and tried to finish my work to school until the time, in which I was supposed to start my schedule in the company came. Before training Right after school, I went to my company building, where I had my schedules and spend most of my time (basically the rest of the day). I always took public transport to get there. We didn\u2019t have a manager driving us around, especially before our debut. If you are set to debut as a solo artist, you train alone just with your trainers and sometimes join some group of trainees for dance practice. If you are supposed to debut as a group, you will train as a group in most of the lesson (mostly the dance ones, vocal/rap lesson were usually individual). That was my case. I should debuted as a maknae dancer and rapper in girl group of five members - the group line-up changed before debut anyway. I was also that lucky, that in my company, trainees could have their phones and use them whenever they were out of the company building. I must just give the managers or some staff member my phone when I entered the company building and when I finished my schedule for a day, they gave me my phone back. I was able to call with my friends and family, but I wasn\u2019t able to have any social media as a trainee, nor share the information from the company to anybody, not even my parents. Right after I came to the company building, I had a lunch with my group members. We had a small cafeteria, in which we usually got the small lunch boxes with rice, some meat, kimchi or just other grilled vegetable. It depended on certain trainee\u2019s diet if they had some. Trainings Because I was considered at that time as the main dancer of the group and lead rapper, I had longer, more intense and more often dance and rapping lessons. Even though you are the main dancer, it is not easier for you in the dance lessons. Coaches are even more mad at you, when you do mistakes or you are unable to learn moves quickly. You are considered to be the best dancer, so you must be able to show them you deserve that title or else, they will pass it on someone else. They may be too harsh on you, but it is because all eyes are on you, when the group is dancing on the stage. As a main dancer, people should see that skills in you immediately as soon as you start dancing. You must be able to pull up great performance and show people that you are really skilled dancer every time you have to dance. Because of my rapper position, I had many korean classes. As a rapper, you must be able to pronounce the words right (especially when you are foreigner) and I must spit many words in small period of time or be able to put emotions and energy even to the slow rapping, to make it interesting for the people. Most people these days think that you are not good rapper unless you can rap like Eminem, but rapping is not just about being fast rapper. Sometimes it is way harder to rap slowly than spit fire around you. I should be able to switch the languages in my rapping lines, because our songs were supposed to have some English/Japanese lines in them. I will tell you that it was really hard for me to be able to switch from one language to another and don\u2019t make it sounds awkward. I started by doing covers of slow rapping song to develop my skill of putting emotions to the each word and when time passed, I came to songs like Doom Dada (T.O.P) etc., to learn how to rap fast. I also had vocal classes, but I had them only once/twice a week, because I wasn't vocalist, but still I attented them to fix my breathing and have the basic skills in singing. But the classes that every trainee have are the language ones. As I said I had many Korean classes (like even three or four per one day sometimes). In those I also learnt Korean manners/culture/history because I didn\u2019t know any of these when I came to the country, which put me into lot of embarrasing situations. How I should act in presence of older or important person, table manners and so on. Because I can speak English (sort of) and also the language from the country where I was born, I learnt Japanese as a third language, but I have never really shined in it as I had difficulties with even Korean, so I was focusing more on that than on learning Japanese. Between those classes I had my acting classes to improve myself infront of camera not just at award shows, concerts, variety shows but also in music videos. I was and still am more of an introvert so standing in front of so many people, cameras, crew etc. was a really big problem for me and it took me a lot of courage to overcome this fear and be a little more relaxed. There it also depends what concept you have with your group. We had one similar to the today's Blackpink/4minute - mature, kinda sexy and mysterious. Nothing like Twice or Girl\u2019s generation. Then as the last ones there were modeling classes, where the photographer usually told you, how you should pose in front of camera to look good on photos, took a photos of you which were then used for the debut promotions. Again, these weren\u2019t that often, but still we had at least 3\u20135 in month. Time after scheduled trainings When I finished my scheduled classes, which I had to attend, I could go back to the dorm and have dinner, but that happend just once or twice per month when there wasn\u2019t really anything particular what I had to work on, or I just felt really exhausted. Normally I stayed in the company building like the rest of the girls from my group and we practised together in the free practise room. Dancing, rapping, acting and other things. It wasn\u2019t of course as intense as the normal classes, we were joking around most of the time while practising, to lighten up the mood after a look tiring day. Sometimes we had dinner there if we ordered one (not gonna lie, in this time of day when there wasn\u2019t a manager or stuff checking our every move, we had some pizza). It was fun, to sit in the practise room with your friends and just talk like normal humans once again. We helped each other with the skills. If someone struggled with rapping, the better one would help her as much as she could. The group where I was, was full of nice girls. Yeah sometimes we just couldn't stand each other, but it was because of stress and tiredness we were under. When you are tired, you just can\u2019t be nice at everybody all the time and sometimes you just say something, which you would normally keep for yourself, which can then start an argument. But that wasn\u2019t happening as much as it did in other groups. On the other hand we were all great friends, who could rely on each other whenever you needed it the most. Everyone wanted the best for our group. It was our dream to debut, we shared it together and none of was had intentions to ruin it for us. All of us were just doing everything in their powers to make us debut. These practises lasted utill 12 PM or 1 AM next day usually. Right after that we went back to the dorms together and went to the bed or study in my case if I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do it earlier that day. SUNDAY Sunday is for every trainees free day, or at least that\u2019s what I always heard even from my friends from other companies. Most trainees usually spend their free time studying if they are still student, some still go to the company to practice if they feel like they still lack in something and they need to fix it before the monthly evaluations. But on this day you had the opportunity to go ot with friends or visit your family if they lived nearby. - ",

Your question probably meant the daily routine of a k-pop trainee but I couldn\u2019t help but share this here. He is just so sweet\u2026.uWu  In the summer of 2012, a 14-year-old trainee with big dreams boarded a plane to Los Angeles for the adventure of a lifetime.  A year before he debuted with BTS, Jungkook traveled to the US to study dance. On February 6, 2013, he shared his memories in a blog post that has recently resurfaced. He entitled it, \u201cAn Ordinary Maknae Trainee\u2019s Dance Training Abroad In America\u201d. This is what he wrote.  \u201cHello this is Jungkookie\u314e I\u2019m nervous because it\u2019s my first time blogging. I wanted to show you the photos I took when we went to the States back in July-August of last year for dance training. -\u3142-. Looking back on these photos now, I\u2019m realizing how young I was. I think I look better now than back in these photos haha.\u201d  \u201cThis is when I boarded the plane headed for the States. \u201c\ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc\u201d (This is sound of Jungkook\u2019s heart thumping!). It\u2019s my first time taking a long flight \ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc\u201d \u201cIn order to become the best dancing Kookie I went to train in LA for about a month(?)This is the photo I took after I got off the plane. I look tired. -\u3142-It was the first time I ever rode a plane, I think I was on it for about 12-13 hours.~\u201d  \u201cOn our way to our dorm, the scenery was so nice so we stopped the car and took pictures.Ah~~~~~~\u201d  \u201cI think we took about 2~3 dance lessons, but they weren\u2019t as difficult as I thought it would be. But I began to have a mental breakdown on the second lesson. I couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying \u315c\u315c. It was a much more difficult level than the first lesson.!!\u201d  \u201cIn the mornings, we would go to a nearby Korean restaurant and eat breakfast before heading to our lesson.Thanks to the Korean food, I didn\u2019t get homesick.-\u3142-!!\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have lessons on the weekends so we played at the beach!We were hungry so we went to a restaurant, but the owners were Korean. They initially thought I was a foreigner so they used English, but the owner\u2019s son recognized that we were Korean. They even gave us the drink on the left for free. Thanks, hyung.-\u3142-\u201d  \u201cyum yum It was so hot that day, we almost died while eating haha.\u201d \u201cWe took a lot of lessons and had to change our clothes a lot, so we went to the laundromat about 1~2 times a week. Honestly, it was a little annoying..^^;\u201d  \u201cWe went to an art museum to look at an exhibit, but there were no one on the stairs so I took a photo while doing an awesome nike! Hahahahahahahahahahah I look pretty awesome.!!\u201d  \u201cThis is the museum I was talking about yesterday\u2026This is the first photo I took once arriving\u2026..The exhibition was worth seeing hahahahahahah.\u201d  \u201cA day before we returned to Korea, I ate lobster for the first time at a nearby seafood restaurant. But since I\u2019m from Busan, I think king crabs are the best. hahahahahah-\u3142-\u201d  \u201cThis is the choreography we learned when we first started dance training.I messed up at the end a lot so I\u2019m embarrassed..; hahahahahahahAfter watching this and then the practice video I took a few days ago, I think I improved a lot.. \u314e\u314e\u201d \u201cThis is MOVEMENT LIFE STYLE. It\u2019s where I took lessons.~ I arrived a little too early for my lessons so no one had arrived yet \u315c\u315c\u201d  \u201cI bought that skateboard in America and started riding it for the first time.!!\u201d  \u201cMy teacher took this photo when I was riding in front of the training room. I look stupid.I am the biggest newbie in skateboarding -\u3142-\u201d  \u201cThe best way to end the blog is with a nike2 !!!!!!\u201d  \u201cThis has been Jeon Jungkookie\u2019s study abroad dance training in America.
