            "answer_text": "What a wonderful question to come across. I am thinking about some of the series of paintings, drawings or photographs that I have done and it seems that for many of them it starts with a simple idea like: doing a series of photographs called \u201cMy Walk to Work,\u201d or a series of drawings I have done entitled \u201cFrom the End of my Street.\u201d I also think about when the ideas actually are started, or what triggers them being formulated in my brain. I actually have to credited an old colleague who I taught with a Montserrat College of Art Gabriella Keller of the series of drawings, \u201cFrom the End of My Street.\u201d We were having a conversation one day, maybe it was about coming up with ideas for work and she quoted Aaron Siskind, who she said to a photography classes Gabriella was in with him: \u201cIf you cannot take a walk around your block and find something to take a photograph of, then there is something wrong and it is not with the camera.\u201d I believe he was saying that the subject is always there it\u2019s a matter of seeing it and then capturing it in an enlightening manner. There was a series of paintings I did years ago entitled, \u201cWhen the Ebb Tide Flows.\u201d The idea for these paintings, which are abstract and based on a loose grid, came out of doing the representational drawings that are a part of the \u201cFrom the End of My Street.\u201d The story goes that while I was siting on a small rocky beach in Cape Elizabeth Maine doing semi-representational drawings and watching the light change throughout the sea and landscape, I started to think about a small loose grid painting I did years before. So I started to do these loose grid paintings again. On nigh while I was in the studio on night working on the ebb tide paintings I had to stop because I didn\u2019t have an idea of what I really wanted to do with them. Even though they are abstract I needed to have a reference point for them and I didn\u2019t. So I just sat and stared looking at what I had done trying to set up a road marker to hit in the paintings. After a time, it dawned on me that the paintings were about how the light I was watching changed and effected the sea and landscape while I was working on the \u201cFrom the End of My Street\u201d drawings. Here\u2019s are a couple of examples of a \u201cFrom the End of my Street:\u201d   Unfortunately I do not have any examples of the Ebb Tide series right now. When I do I\u2019ll post a few. To recap: there\u2019s coming up with an idea that was triggered because of something someone said to you, or something you see. Sometimes the ideas just come when you are doing something other than being creative. The truth of the matter is ideas can happen at anytime anywhere you just have to be open to possibilities. I remember repainting our little foyer many years ago and for whatever reason I came up with the idea of taking photos and messing with them in iPhoto. Here are a few examples from that series \u201cMy Psychotic Foyer\u201d :    Hope this helps, I had a fun time answering the question. ",

            "answer_text": "That's not an easy question to answer so I'll just keep it simple. To start, you have to seek out things that seem interesting to paint - that usually first happens as you are learning about art, you are exposed to a variety of subject matter and set-ups for you to learn and develop your skills. Often the work starts the ball rolling into what direction you might take - you find that you like landscape, or portraits, or abstract, and you seek to explore it further. As you learn your ideas evolve and artists who continue into advanced studies have to choose a theme for their work, so exploring ideas becomes the nature of the artist's work and develops into a body of work.  I started with mostly figurative work, studied life drawing and anatomy drawing/painting for years, but at one point things changed for me and I no longer had access to model/subjects, and for me what became an emotional exploration was beginning painting landscapes and then abstract. I was drawn to the subject of landscape and I can't exactly tell you why, it chose me. I'm more a traditionally trained artist, so I paint landscape, still life and abstract - and all of them I paint from a very abstract approach, I don't paint what I see, but paint what I experience as the sense of each of the subject. So, I don't choose anything to paint, but choose to paint and then follow where it leads - I have a sense in mind of what I'd like to convey, and that's what I aim for. ",
