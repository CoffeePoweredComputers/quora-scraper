            "answer_text": "At one point last year, this was my most played song on Spotify so I've definitely spent a lot of time listening to it and understanding what is meant behind the lyrics.  Ariana's verses:   Tell me something I need to knowThen take my breath and never let it goIf you just let me invade your spaceI'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain And if in the moment I bite my lipBaby, in that moment you'll know this isSomething bigger than us and beyond blissGive me a reason to believe it In the first verse she's pleading with The Weeknd to open up and let her in. She knows that it will be worth it (pleasure and happiness) but since it sounds like he might have some baggage, she acknowledges that it could be painful and not easy. When she sings about biting her lip, she's indicating that it's a subtle sign to him that they both want each other and she's waiting for him to agree.  Chorus: 'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harderAnd if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder Pretty self-explanatory. What person hasn't found themselves in this situation where they've asked the person that they like/love to commit, put in more effort, try, etc.  The Weeknd's verses: I know your motives and you know mineThe ones that love me, I tend to leave behindIf you know about me and choose to stayThen take this pleasure and take it with the pain And if in the moment you bite your lipWhen I get you moaning you know it's realCan you feel the pressure between your hips?I'll make it feel like the first time The Weeknd is pushing Ariana away and telling her that he's trouble, but should she choose to stay and pursue this, there's definitely going to be pleasure and pain. In his second verse, things are escalating VERY quickly.  Bridge: So what do I do if I can't figure it out? (figure it out)You got to try, try, try again, yeah.So what do I do if I can't figure it out? (figure it out)I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again The Weeknd has given in. He wants to make things work and he's asking Ariana to show him how and the consequences if he fails. Typical rise and fall of a relationship! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s clear that several of the songs of Ariana Grande have deliberate \u2018sexual innuendo\u2019s\u2019, meaning they are suggestive and can be interpreted either romantically or sexually. And if in the moment I bite my lipBaby, in that moment you'll know this isSomething bigger than us and beyond blissGive me a reason to believe it This is a clear example of sexual innuendo. Adults will interpret this as reaching mutual orgasm while engaging in sexual activity: \u2018something bigger than us and beyond bliss\u2019: it\u2019s about sexual gratification, because at the moment of orgasm one surpasses oneself. I think the songwriters and record company of Ariana Grande love these kind of lyrics because you have an attractive lady singing about sexuality and sexuality sells. \u2018Love me Harder\u2019 can also be interpreted both romantically (in the sense you love one very much), but also sexually (as in rough sex).
