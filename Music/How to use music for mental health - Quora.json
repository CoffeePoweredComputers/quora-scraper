            "answer_text": "I really like the idea of this, but I myself am not too well versed in music therapy. I will say that music is activating to the Limbic system of the brain which is responsible for secretion of dopamine that leads to pleasurable moods. This should decrease stress and/or depression. Using music could foster \u201cmindfulness\u201d which is the mindset that describes living in the present and being aware of your surroundings and social setting versus dwelling on the past. Hope this helps! ",
