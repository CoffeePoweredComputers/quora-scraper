            "answer_text": "You actually can! Auditioning for kpop does not require you to have professional training or a need to be good at dancing etc,, but of course you should have some background knowledge about it. kpop companies usually would train you for a few months before they actually choose you, and they will develop your voice, dancing, acting, rapping and so on, so you need not worry about your experience in singingI do, however, feel that it might not be a good idea to audition for kpop at this point in time, as kpop as a music genre has reached its peaking point, so once you get into a band it might be a year or so later, and kpop would not really be a thing anymore. That is just my personal opinion. But what you choose to do is totally up to you, so if you want to audition for kpop, go ahead! ",
