            "answer_text": "It appears to refers to no one specific band, but reflects on the archetype of the traditional '60s and '70s UK or US rock band, such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Wings, Black Sabbath, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, The Who, Aerosmith, Deep Purple and others. Perhaps less Rolling Stones, Aerosmith and Alice Cooper, given they've all continued on, but the others have all broken up, regardless of some having reformed at one point or another. I wouldn't be surprised is The Cars is also an influence of sorts, given that Ric Ocasek came back to work with Weezer again for the first time in about 10 years or so for \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\". Additionally, and strangely, the song resembles \"Mr Brightside\" by The Killers, however its subject matter hearkens back to a yesteryear, suggesting more of the earlier bands I've mentioned. ",

            "answer_text": "hard to say.  maybe its a sort of rorschach test.  one sees one's own favorite band from back in the day, from whatever generation you claim, in that picture.  the template actually applies to more than one group out there...  so why does it have to be specific?   there may be some potentially contradictory clues in the lyrics, or in the musical motifs, or the context of a couple of other songs on the album, especially \"back to the shack\".  who knows?  and like a lot of weezer songs, you've got to expect more than a touch of irony, like the advice of a fan to the band they love: \"We'll never forget the jams you made. Let em fade. It's time that we laid you in your grave.\"    haha.  I can think of a few who fit the bill. ",
