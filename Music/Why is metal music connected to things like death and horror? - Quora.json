            "answer_text": "Heavy metal music often relies on an augmented 4th chord that was banned from medieval church music for its dissonant \"evil\" sound. Other names for it include the devil's interval, the devil's tritone, or the diabolus in musica (Latin for \"the devil in music\"). For many people, this chord goes naturally with death or horror imagery, which is why a lot of heavy metal bands exploit the connection. The pioneering metal band Black Sabbath is not only the biggest popularizer of the devil's tritone in rock & roll music, but they also named themselves after a 1963 horror movie. Other heavy metal bands who rely on death and horror imagery in their lyrics or their visual presentation on stage are merely following the path set by Black Sabbath. ",

Often, this can come across angry, and many artists have had fun with the sound by connecting it to darker topics because, well, they can. Not all metal music is this way, however. Here is an article I found with  The 10 Most Inspiring Metal Songs. Not my article, but gives very good examples. ",
