            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never seen the movie about Borat, and I do not want to see it. I do not share the opinion that it somehow belittles my country. How could it? The man that made this movie clearly has never been to Kazakhstan, and judging by what I\u2019ve read on the Internet, this film\u2019's purpose is to make fun of American society\u2026at the expense of Kazakhstan. Of course, I will never be objective about this subject, because it's my country we\u2019really talking about. Some Kazakhs say that the film was useful in a sense, because people learned about Kazakhstan, and went on the Internet and looked it up qnd learned something about it. Some people say it sparked an interest in Kazakhstan. Still,in my experience, ignorant individuals do not bother looking up stuff. They just take what is shown to them as if it were the truth. I have been approached by people in the US asking me if Kazakhstan was really like in Borat, or even expressing surprise that this country actually existed, and Sasha Baron Koen did not make it up for the movie. It's not a great experience. I do not want anyone to associate Kazakhstan with this film. To be honest, rarely anyone does nowadays. I\u2019m glad. ",

            "answer_text": "I've never seen this movie. I've never heard about that until one of my friend mentioned it. After his remarks about Borat  everyone started to talk about it aggressively. Since that I can say for sure that Kazakhs hate Borat and they all watched it. I can describe how people in Kazakhstan feel about that: One group of the people, especially youngsters and some adults, watched this movie and hates it. Second group is people who never watched it but hates is as well due to the human prejudice, I can surely be in that group. And last group is people who nerver heard about this nor watched it. The latter is especially people of the old age or children from 1-6.  In this little narrative you can see that Borat has huge impact on Kazakhstan citizens life.  ",
