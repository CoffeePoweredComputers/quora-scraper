            "answer_text": "Okay So, I will be clear that I don't ship them and this edits are fan made.  (This is not real; just an edit) LizKook (Lisa X Kookie ) So they have looked at each other for like 2 seconds, are both Maknaes, and are both attractive + Talented. Thats it. No reason to ship then lmao. I feel like this ship is a self insert for female fans of JK (cuz hes the most popular BTS member) and self insert thru Lisa bc she is the most biased BP member. God y\u2019all are pathetic. 2. Ros\u00e9kook People ship them cuz of this : Ros\u00e9 is main vocalist of Black Pink. Jungkook is Main Vocalist of BTS. Ros\u00e9 is the Lead Dancer in Black Pink. Jungkook is the Lead Dancer in BTS. Also about Jungkook fav food being \u201c Ros\u00e9 Pasta \u201c and the fact that JK avoids girls & Rosie avoids guys. I don't think that having the same position in the group mean you like each other- it doesn't even make sense. JK x Rosie was super popular until Lizkook dominated, but it\u2019s still there. Like really people, come on??!!  From when they MCed on a show together.  ITS AN EDIT NOT REAL 3. Taesoo & Taennie. I see a lot of both of these everywhere I go. People ship Taennie because before Jennie became an ambassador for Chanel, she wore a lot of Gucci. Apparently them having a similar style means they are dating? Okay sis\ud83d\ude05 Taesoo blew up when V & Jisoo MCed together on an award show. Apparently they had \u201cchemistry\u201d or some shit. No, hun, they were reading from a script. \ud83d\ude02 Tae did look at Jisoo a lot but she is really pretty, especially to Koreans, so can you blame him? This doesn\u2019t mean they are together or dating, stop making a mountain out of a mole hill. Delulus.  AGAIN REMINDER ITS NOT REAL 4. Jirose They are shipped cuz their face are similar. This logic is like what- they look like siblings tho but I don't think there is any \u201c special \u201c reason to ship them. Like WHAT? Oki Felicia baii.  I\u2019ve said it before and ima say it again. ITS JUST AN EDIT CALM THY SELVES. 5. Jinsoo (Jin X Jisoo)\u2014-So people ship them bc they have similar visuals (Uh shouldn\u2019t this make them siblings rather than lovers? Lmao) and like a lot of the same things. I can see WHY you ship them, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s real. Just because two people COULD be good together doesn\u2019t mean they automatically are or even want to be. Stop projecting onto idols cringey humans. Alrighty. So those are the most popular BlackTan ships. However, fanbases for any BP member X any BTS Member exist. Trust me, I\u2019ve checked. Just search up \u201cJennie\u201d X \u201cRM\u201d and a thousand edits and fanfics will flood ur screen. Like there\u2019s JK x Soo, Rosie X Suga, JK x Jennie, RM x Soo, Hobi X Lisa, etc. Shipping in general is toxic and dumb. On the very unlikely chance that any of these ships are real, okay, good for the people involved. BUT it\u2019s none of your business and you do not and should not know anything about these idols\u2019 personal lives. Imagine a BTS or BP member is dating someone, and that person is bombarded with these edits of their GF/BF kissing someone who isn\u2019t them everyday! Imagine how uncomfortable BTS/BP feel! These edits have probably made it awkward and ruined chances of friendship between the members!! The wonders of Technology are at the tip of our fingers and THIS is what y\u2019all choose to do? Lmao I\u2019m ashamed to be the same species as you.   ",
