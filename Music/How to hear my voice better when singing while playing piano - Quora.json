            "answer_text": "Both previous answers are excellent, but I thought I\u2019d throw this out there if you don\u2019t have or can\u2019t afford a mic. Get a pair of earplugs. There are lots to choose from in all price ranges, but for this, just get a cheap pair of the foam ones they sell in the drugstore. First, put both in and sing. Hear all the nuances? Now, if the piano is not loud enough, try it with one earplug in. PS: This is how I warmed up before a gig in the dressing room. If anythings not right, you\u2019ll know quickly. ",
