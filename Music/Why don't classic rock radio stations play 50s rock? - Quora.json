            "answer_text": "The delineation occurred with Beatlemania and the rest of the musical British Invasion. An influential radio station stated everything before the Beatles was termed \u201coldie\u201d rock, so that separated the rock music listening audience. Also those grew up in the \u201850s are mostly aged 80 or 90 now, so the fan base is way down (though not extinct). Hope that music never completely goes away, but music stations are pretty cutthroat with their playlists. There are various subcultures that listen to \u201850s rock (rockabillies, some lowriders), so who knows with more technology maybe there can be a solution? ",

            "answer_text": "Supply and demand. Not enough people ask for or listen to it, especially at enough of a rate to warrant more air time. Radio stations need to sell ads to stay in business. The way they sell ads is by quantity of listeners. The way they get more listeners is playing what the people want to hear. Get enough people to request 50\u2019s music and you\u2019ll get stations to play it. Simple business ",
