            "answer_text": "You've hated on Zuckerberg and co. several times for changes they've made to your favorite social network. But face it. Sometimes they were right and you were wrong. And other times, they gave you exactly what you were looking for. 10. Events  Face it, without Facebook events you wouldn't know what's going on. You can thank Zuckerberg for your current social life. 9. Timeline  Timeline was met with mixed reviews, like most major redesigns. We like it. The old wall was too cramped. In Timeline, photos, new friends, and other content now flows smoother in a wider, double-barrel river. It's not flawless, though. Zuckerberg doesn't even use life events. 8. Social Plugins  These let you comment from your Facebook account on sites like the New York Times and Global http://Grind.com. 7. Embed-in-Post  Facebook was several years ahead of Twitter on this one. When you post articles, videos, and pictures on Facebook, the linked content is fetched and delivered right in the post, saving you a click. 6. The Wall  The original: the Wall started it all. 5. Relationship Status  If you saw The Social Network, you saw this idea plop into Zuck's head. Now you know whether that guy/girl you met last night/last weekend is single/engaged/married/in an open relationship, etc. 4. Messenger  We all thought we didn't need another chat platform. Turns out that yet again, we were wrong and Zuck was right. Now it's in the top 75 most downloaded apps in Apple's App store. 3. The Like Button  Before the Like button, to approve of another person's post, you had to write, \"Like\" or, \"Yeah!\" or, \"Wow, I like that too LOL!\" Those were dark times. 2. News Feed  This was the update that launched a million protest groups. Zuck's response: \"Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.\" In the end, we breathed, we came around to the idea, and now we can't imagine our online social lives without it. Thanks Zuck. 1. Photos  This may be the most popular use of Facebook. It was Sean Parker's idea, Scott Marlette engineered it, and the application launched in October 2005. It's Facebook's pride and joy. That's why Zuck had to spend a cool billion nipping Instagram in the bud. ",
