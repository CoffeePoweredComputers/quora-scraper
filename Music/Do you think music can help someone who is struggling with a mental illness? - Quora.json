            "answer_text": "Do you think music can help someone who is struggling with a mental illness? More than a year ago, during a hot and shiny summer, I was staying in a hotel together with a few friends. We've been there for a training. However bright the day was, however beautiful this summer turned out to be, my mind kept being troubled with somber, grey, almost terrifyingly dark, muddy fog. I'm a person with schizophrenia. I suffer from this illness for quite some years now but I'm doing rather good, so at that time I was reducing the dose of my meds. That brought back symptoms. They crept back into my life, slowly and steadily. During a break, I was sitting in some kind of lobby and got anxious. Not terribly so but still anxious. The voices started harassing me with their abusive choice of words and harsh sound. They got louder. And louder. And louder. Nobody could see it but within me, a battle took place. My confidence, without armour, against the voices, clad in iron, armed to the teeth. The voices always know what to say in order to hurt you. And then, Daniel started playing.  He didn't know I was struggling in this very minute. He just wanted to practice. He played for his own pleasure - and thereby won my battle for me. The sound of piano music calms me. It soothes my anxiety and redirects my mind to another thing, so it can push away the voices. Daniel saved my day back then. With his magical talent. He struck away the voices with every hit his fingertips pressed on the keys. I recorded him, so I can play it on demand. Of course I told him that I recorded him and why I did and that I would delete it immediately if he's not okay with that. But he's an angel who was glad to provide me with a new tool in my box of tricks, meant to keep me going. No other music ever helped me in that way. But piano music has an unimaginable therapeutic effect on me. Yes, my dear, I do think music can help people who struggle with mental illness. ",

I play music almost all the time, whether I am writing or working out or whatever. I\u2019m sure the people around me wish I would shut up, but I often sing aloud along with the music. Okay, I lied, I only do that when I am alone, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for people running madly away, hands over their ears, into traffic or something. There is a certified therapy called music therapy, using music and talk therapy. That kind of music can go a long way to healing.

            "answer_text": "Well yes. In a few ways. Appreciating music is some kind of weird form of expression. Playing music or creating it? Even better. Music on it\u2019s own is just supportive though. So let\u2019s just say part of mental illness often involves some blockage or inhibition of expression of both emotions and creativity. Anything that allows feelings to come out and be recognized and acknowledged? That is helpful. And appreciation of music allows it. Some say dancing is one of the best ways to express yourself. It\u2019s fun. According to Teal Swan? Great spiritual lady in Australia? Rap and hip hop actually stimulate your root chakra too. Certain sounds like the monks changing in tibet? Ohmmm? Just humming that can stimulate your Vagus nerve. This also helps depression somehow. ",

            "answer_text": "Dude, I\u2019m a 7 year Army Veteran, who struggles with Schizophrenia, sure i\u2019m not symptomatic now, the VA has me on some good drugs. Playing the guitar has been an outlet for me and a medical treatment for me. Sure I\u2019ve played for 27 years, but once the VA got my meds right, I\u2019ve been humming along on the strings. I used to medicate the disease with half gallons of vodka, let me tell you, that was the wrong approach, that lead to nothing but trouble with the law, jail, even imprisonment. So i seeked out help from the VA, it took 10 years of hospital stays, rehab, mental health counseling, therapy, groups, and of course med changes to finally get the right mix of therapy and meds. Now i go to the VA for 5 classes(Group Therapy) a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays for maintenance, but all other days are devoted to playing and learning the guitar, I want to goto college for classical guitar training(4 year degree from U C Cincinnati) I already have a degree in Electrical Engineering, so some of those credits will transfer for the basics, math, english, speech, ect.. ect.. but i have to have a 2 year music understudy before U C will accept me. Guitar is my life and I totally live for it, I use it to moderate my sickness and calm the voices from within. You say the guitar is there to help people with mental illnesses, I say \u201cDitto\u201d It has helped me through the roughest times of my life! ",
