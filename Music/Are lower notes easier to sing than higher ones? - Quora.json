            "answer_text": "It depends on your vocal fach. Male voices from low to high are bass, baritone, tenor and countertenor. Female voices from low to high are contralto, alto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. Obviously a bass is going to find low notes easier than a soprano, because his vocal range is lower. You can find your range: there are plenty of apps out there that recognise what note you are singing, so all you have to do is sing as low as possible and as high as possible, and put that into a range. My lowest note is C3 and my highest is C#7. You might think I'm a soprano or a mezzo, but actually, I'm a low contralto! Take your range and decide what part of it you are most comfortable in. After a note like F5, do you start to strain? Maybe you're an alto. Do you get a bit coughy or have your chin shoved into your chest when you try to sing a note like Eb3? So for me, yes, low notes are easier, but for you it might be different. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say it depends on the individual. Having been both an alto and soprano (I lie more within a mezzo-soprano comfortability), I\u2019ve found that ascending into higher notes is actually more difficult/straining than descending into lower ones. With lower notes, it involves active use of chest voice, and at some point your voice just can\u2019t go any lower. With higher notes, however, the body acts in a different way, in that head voice takes over and the throat naturally wants to get tighter. But my choral director always used to emphasize thinking upward as one sings lower, and thinking downward as one sings higher, as that mentality makes for a less strained outcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Normally this question depends on the singer and their training. A good rule of thumb is that with an unrestricted air passage, and using a lot of air, e.g warming up a frosted car window (lots of warm air), one can sing high and low with ease. From a good foundation, one can extend their vocal range by practicing lower and higher notes each day, while keeping up the fundamentals necessary to maintain their growth goals as a human and musician.

This will require you looking Very nice at first voice consultant; it will cost big bucks. Learning to to sing well with no strain and longevity is an art.
