            "answer_text": "A tribute (often explicitly) displays admiration and esteem of someone or something. For example, a tribute could be a band covering a famous song. Paying homage also displays admiration and esteem, but most often for historical events, movements, and figures, and usually (but not always) does so externally. For example, a poet could incorporate Shakespeare\u2019s prose into a verse, paying homage to his style through allusion. The etymology behind \u2018paying homage\u2019 essentially denotes an act of service in vassalage. So here, you can think of the modern equivalent as that of \u2018paying your dues\u2019 or \u2018giving credit\u2019 to something larger than yourself. Both are out of respect, while dependant on context, can be used to describe how directly said respected entity is being acknowledged. ",
