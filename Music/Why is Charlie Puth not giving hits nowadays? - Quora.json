            "answer_text": "Believe me he is trying hard. Making songs is not that easy, plus he just released two of his songs \u2018Girlfriend\u2019 and \u2018Hard On Yourself\u2019. I think they are really amazing but people have their own opinions. His new songs are on the way and every time when he makes us wait, its worth it. Maybe CP3 is also coming soon and you just have to be patient \u2019cause i know that its worth the wait. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a ",
