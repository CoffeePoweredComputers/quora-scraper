            "answer_text": "Is it bad that I don't want non-Asians in K-pop? Well\u2026it's not bad per s\u00e9. I get it. And I halfway agree in spite of my Liberal self. If in the 80's/90's, I'd said \u201cI don't want white people rapping,\u201d that would've sounded terribly racist. Rap is black invented, but should it stay completely black owned? I would've missed out on 3rd Bass, the Beastie Boys and Eminem! That's why racism is so incendiary, among many reasons. However\u2026because white rappers showed up in moderation, nobody felt threatened. See where I'm going?  Not going all in is one of the reasons why Kpop will struggle globally. In order to truly expand it would literally have to open itself to other races. Because most people will not fully accept a thing that they don't have a stake in.  I'm all for having the occasional mixed player or full-blooded non-Asian. But yeah, it wouldn't be the same Kpop if it were wholly integrated. Maybe it would be worse. Maybe better. Only one way to find out\u2026but do you want to? Like with rap, I'm good with integrating Kpop. Just not by much. I think cultural significance is just that important. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I have a similar mind, although I\u2019m okay with having non-Asians in K-pop. K-pop, although despite the influences of American and African music culture, is still Korean. I can see people calling a song a K-pop song if it fulfills at least one of these conditions on top of representing K-pop culture in some kind of way (like dance, choreography): The majority or at least 30% of the people singing it are KoreanThe song has Korean lyrics and actually makes sense (You don\u2019t call K-pop American pop because it has some English phrases. Same logic is applied for the other way around.)The song is produced by a Korean company (but if it\u2019s this case it better have some Korean words)I wouldn\u2019t call a group that doesn\u2019t have a single Korean as its member, doesn\u2019t sing in Korean, and doesn\u2019t have any of the trade-marks of K-pop (as in the polished dance skills with some singing) as a K-pop group. If there is a group doing so, obviously they\u2019re just calling themselves \u2018K-pop\u2019 to gain popularity and actually has no respect for K-pop culture or Korean culture in general. And those people do in fact piss me off. ",
