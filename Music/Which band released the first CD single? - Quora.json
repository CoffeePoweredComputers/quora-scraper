            "answer_text": "Says Wikipedia, \u2018Dire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms\" (1985) is reported to have been the world's first CD single, issued in the UK in two separate singles as a promotional item, one distinguished with a logo for the tour, Live in '85, and a second to commemorate the Australian leg of the tour marked Live in '86. Containing four tracks, it had a very limited print run. The first commercially released CD Single was Angeline by John Martyn released on 1 February 1986. CD singles were first made eligible for the UK Singles Chart in 1987, and the first number 1 available on the format in that country was \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" by Whitney Houston in May 1987. The Mini CD single CD3 format was originally created for use for singles in the late 1980s, but met with limited success, particularly in the US. The smaller CDs were more successful in Japan and had a resurgence in Europe early this century, marketed as \"Pock it\" CDs, being small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. By 1989, the CD3 was in decline in the US (replaced by the 5-inch CD single, called CD-5). ",

The first CD album is supposedly ABBA's The Visitors from around 1981/82 but I don't remember commercially available domestic players being available that early. ",
