            "answer_text": "Because although other music industries have similar elements, the k-pop industry has taken them to a new extreme. It seems unimaginable to people that there are kids and teenagers who will spend years of their life training for something which may not even happen. Everyone knows training isn\u2019t easy; there\u2019s long hours, late nights, diets, evaluations\u2014all things which are sure to happen in other music industries but have never been accepted or promoted the way it is in the Korean entertainment industry. In the k-pop industry, trainees spend years away from their families, undergoing well-documented hardship, all for a dream which could easily fall through if they cannot perform to the standard that is expected of them. And because they are young and there are countless others who share the same dream and will take their place, there is a specific mold they are expected to fit into. Particularly the larger companies like SM, YG, JYP, Cube, Starship etc\u2014each of these expect you to become who they want you to be. BTS succeeded in the West partially because they had this raw authenticity that came from being put together by a smaller, less established company, who kept only trainees who truly loved music, and also from being so involved in the music process; they created their own sound. It wasn\u2019t given to them and then expected that they would become who the company wanted them to be. Again, it\u2019s not that such pressures don\u2019t happen in other music industries. If you look at One Direction, they didn\u2019t have a lot of artistic/creative direction themselves until a little further on in their career. But what they always maintained was their true personalities. Of course, they will have received some media training but they still goofed off in front of the cameras, they still misbehaved and had fun and did all the things normal teenagers do and it was, to a certain degree, expected of them. No-one expected 16/17/18-year-olds to be flawless and there was leniency for that. The problem is that the k-pop industry has set its standard at perfection. In the k-pop industry, you cannot act silly or be known as a bit of trouble-maker, especially in the early parts of your career. The industry has caused this manufactured image to be shown to the rest of the world, not because it\u2019s a way to discredit the industry but because the industry is manufactured. And a lot of that comes also from societal expectations\u2014one scandal in Korea and a celebrity\u2019s career could be over, particularly as a rookie. Cancel culture is strong. Companies often pick their stars for their visuals before talent, and it\u2019s an expected and normal part of the industry. If this was done with such brazen pride in the west, all hell would be let loose and there would be an outcry of misogyny, objectification, discrimination, fat-shaming, and over-sexualisation of young teens. But the k-pop industry doesn\u2019t care about this because it can afford to practice in this way. Even Jin from BTS was picked for his visuals\u2014did anyone think it weird? No, and thankfully, he\u2019s also an amazing singer as well so he fit well into BigHit. However, do that in other music industries and the company/management label would be torn to shreds. To summarise, people call the industry twisted and manufactured because it is. Of course, other industries have their own similar problems but no other music industry in the world displays the more uncomfortable aspects of their practices with more pride. Has the k-pop industry produced amazing stars? Yes, of course. Are they all manufactured? No, not all of them but especially from the bigger companies, there is a personality/type expectation and if you don\u2019t fit, you won\u2019t debut. Do other industries have similar problems? Yes, Korea just happens to push its k-pop industry to the extreme because of the tremendous amount of competition. Hope this helped. \u2014Sani ",
