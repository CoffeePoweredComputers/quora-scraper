            "answer_text": "In some of the books I've read on Bowie over the years it's been written and observed that Bowie had a problem with the song Rocket Man, because he felt it was a rip off of Space Oddity. Bowie also seemed to feel that Elton was muscling in on Bowie's stage act with his flamboyant costumes. Bowie was human and certainly flawed as we all are and he probably just found things about Elton John annoying. He's not alone, I do too. He probably saw him as a bit middle if the road and not at all edgy or dangerous. Bas chemistry between people comes into it. A bit of jealousy too, as Elton has sold a lot more records and was successful a lot quicker than Bowie, who struggled for years to break it big. It's interesting to note that I'm Still Standing and Modern Love, which were released and recorded fairy close together have some similarities. Such as the energetic piano riffs and the upbeat vibe. They're just two human beings who didn't like each other in the main; it happens. ",

            "answer_text": "Bowie and Elton used to be real close friends\u2026 hanging out at the gay clubs together - Bowie obviously thought that John wasn\u2019t being real with himself ( in the closet?) as well; John did not like the Ziggy Stardust show in London - for being androgynous - making him very uncomfortable at the time. John reportedly said \u2018we\u2019re through\u2019 \u2018he\u2019s blown it\u2019.  Rare photo? of the two together\u2026 lol They were really in each others lanes\u2026 Their views were just different - leading to drifting apart. Things said, uncomfortableness and maybe too much history in trying to break through. Maybe John seemed like Bowie\u2019s shows were aimed at him personally? - but I do believe they thought highly of each others creativity - although in the press it seemed like 40 years of turmoil.
