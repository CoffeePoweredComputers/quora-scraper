            "answer_text": "Nice Question. This is the same question that popped into my mind when I first started out with the geetar. The Answer is : NO. They are completely different. Givson Guitars are a basically Chinese products. That is why they are sold for a cheap price in India. Most of us would easily be able to afford one of them. I won\u2019t say that Givson Guitars are bad. One of my friends had it here in VNIT, and it sounded okay. Can\u2019t expect a classy sound out of it, but it was definitely playable. You would get the acoustic givson guitars for about 5\u20138k. The electric guitars might touch 10k. But I gotta tell you, the electric ones are nothing more than a pile of cowdung. They sound horrible. On the other hand, Gibson is an American company that manufactures all sorts of guitars and it\u2019s accessories. Ofcourse, they are pricey. The legendary Gibson Les Paul electric geetar could cost you about Rs. 300k /- (Or 3 Lakhs!!). But I\u2019ll tell you, every damn nickel is worth it. When you rock that baby on your lap, you\u2019ll feel like you have received eternal bliss. Gibson has produced a lot of legendary guitars for various artists throughout the course of Modern Rock. They even have subsidiaries that most of us can afford. Those are: Epiphone, Steinberger, Kramer, Cakewalk, etc. Those would range from about 20k to 30k.    Aren\u2019t those Beautiful? They are the shit. I dream about getting one of those. Be my guest. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hahahah!! Very common question that confuses a lot of guitar players, majority from India. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. The answer is NO!! Gibson is a luxury guitar brand from USA. They manufacture some of the highest quality guitars ever and are a renowned brand among guitar players. Their guitars are owned and played by some of the most reputed musicians ( Slash, Jimmy page, billy gibbson, Zakk Wylde, Angus young and the list goes on!! ) Though now in some financial Crisis, this company is like the Ferrari of guitars. ( controversial statement :p ) On the other hand we have GiVson, with a V. These guitars are made in Kolkata with the cheapest wood possible, the quality is pathetic and can bring tears to a guitar players eyes if the guitar is left out and played after a while ( not exaggerating ) . They call it the seasoned toon wood. Though the quality is ok for the price if you see. The difference can be seen in the price of the guitars too. GiVson guitars start from a price range of rupees 4000 while a GiBson costs rupees 70000 for the starting model and goes up to 5\u20137 lakhs too. ( The price is higher also due to this being imported from USA but still it\u2019s the quality which it\u2019s listed at that price point ) Cheers!! ",

They are very well made guitars and have been used over long periods of time for producing good music.  Givson are cheap & low quality Indian knock-offs of \u2018Gibson\u2019 manufactured in Kolkata.  These guitars are usually made from very low quality resources and do not deserve to be played by any aspiring musician. Hope this helps, keep rocking hard! Cheers! ",

There is also another brand Grason which is a spin off from Givson. These are about the cheapest guitars available. Sometime ago, I ended up purchasing a Grason GS 1000 Electric guitar with HSH pickups as my first guitar as it seemed very inexpensive - however, the pickups & electronics seem to be of very very poor quality as the rest of the guitar!
