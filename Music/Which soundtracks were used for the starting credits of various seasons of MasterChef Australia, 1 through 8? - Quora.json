            "answer_text": "Masterchef, just like many other reality TV shows tend to use stock library music throughout the production. However, the signature song is usually a production-specific track. For example, Katy Perry has sung the theme for a number of series (Hot and Cold) but this isn\u2019t a general release track. It\u2019s a production track that is copyright Endemol Shine, so it\u2019s probably a special track just made for the show. ",
