            "answer_text": "That depends on which one you prefer, and whether it will disturb you or not, though I'm more inclined to say Classical Music, since Jazz tends to be more energetic (with exceptions of course) which can increase the distraction. I always study with classical music, and no one will be able to convince me that music is \"bad\" for studying. That being said, I also don't think rap or pop music can possibly be good for studying. The kind of reaction it gives you and your brain in particular (I don't want to go too far into human psychology, but I feel that rap makes people focus on the music a lot more with the repetitive beat that makes you want to clap or move on the beat, the energetic vocal lines that constantly grab your attention etc) is incredibly unnecessary for studying. The beautiful thing about Classical music is that there is so much of it that it can evoke almost any emotion. There are pieces that can make you calm down, but there are also pieces that can give you emotions similar to what a rock concert can offer you. TL;DR It really is down to your own preference, but I'd give the slight edge to classical music since it tends to be more soothing than most other genres. ",

            "answer_text": "One problem I faced when studying is the fact that whatever music was playing, it took my attention and diverted me from the task in hand. So, for me, silence please. If I HAD to choose, it would be something cool and non mind-invasive, such as the George Shearing Quintet playing \u2018I\u2019ll Be Around\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll Remember April\u2019, \u2018Lullaby of Birdland\u2019 and so on. Smoothly great in the background with little to grab your attention. Conversely, don\u2019t play \u2018The Atomic Mr. Basie\u2019 or you\u2019ll lose a lot of time. I cannot NOT listen to any of the classics and work at the same time, so to play - for example - a Tchaikovsky symphony would be counterproductive. Such music demands the attention of the listener.
