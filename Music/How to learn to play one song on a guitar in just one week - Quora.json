            "answer_text": "My advice is determination, patience and time management. When I want to do that with song I\u2019d love to learn. Usually, I make the song into different parts, and day by day I learn each part alone. Of course, it\u2019s different from a song to another. But for example, Metallica\u2019s Nothing Else Matters. I started to learn the intro which took about 2 days or something. Then verse chords, and the chorus they didn\u2019t take more than one day. And next I started to work on guitar licks and the solo. But for sure there are songs who take more than a week. Good luck! :D ",

So you get to see how chords fit together, and how songs are built up one chord at a time. If you play the chords in different orders, you get lots of songs. The third one can be used for Louie, louie and Wild Thing out of the oldies. But the 1\u20134\u20135 pattern is everywhere. The final one also is four chords that just power thousands of songs. As I say, not quite what you asked for, but you do get videos, backing tracks - and will pick up a bit about how songs are made. So I hope it helps. ",
