            "answer_text": "I'm Bi Polar. Music can help me with mood swings. If I am manic, I listen to melodic songs with a slow tempo, sort of like ballad style songs or music like Deep Forest. Muse helps slow my mania. If I am feeling low, I crank up the more fast tempos, pop, techno, rock. No love songs or break up songs. More songs with a great rock intro. Queen is a favourite of mine. AC/DC. ",
