            "answer_text": "I think Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People takes the cake here. It has over 5+ million certified units/sales with 6x platinum and is played on the radio all the time hitting the charts a few times. It has a very upbeat pop and catchy tune which has really drawn a lot of people in. However if you carefully listen to the lyrics this is how it goes: Robert's got a quick handHe'll look around the room, he won't tell you his planHe's got a rolled cigarette\nHanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kidYeah, he found a six-shooter gunIn his dad's closet, in the box of fun things\nI don't even know what\nBut he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you All the other kids with the pumped up kicksYou better run, better run, outrun my gunAll the other kids with the pumped up kicksYou better run, better run, faster than my bullet Nuff said.

While Copacabana, with its uppity happy melody, is about a brawl that ended up in murder of a showgirl's lover. There's also Polly by Nirvana, sounds light and simple for the punk band, until you realize the lyrics is about a girl being kidnapped and raped\u2026 \u201cLet me take a ride/Don't cut yourself/I need a help/To please myself.\u201d ",
