            "answer_text": "Actually you can not adjust the action without a truss rod. But you can try to change it by following steps. Change the string to low gauge or light gauge strings - It will leave lesser tension to your guitar.Keep your guitar rest on floor and keep weights on the tuning head and lower side of the sound box. It will cause the fret board to bend a little bit. But make sure to add weights which will not hurt your guitar.If the second step doesn\u2019t workout, just save some money and buy a new one. Because if you really wanna learn guitar, good guitar is a very important factor.If your guitar is not comfortable or not making good sound, it will automatically leave to quit what you are learning.I would suggest you to buy Havana guitars or Aston or Granada. These are very basic guitar but perfect for a learner. They are below 6000 INR. But serves it\u2019s purpose perfectly. Wish you very all the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Classical/nylon string guitars traditionally don\u2019t have a truss rods, so obviously there are other ways to fix action issues. It depends on the reason your action is too high. If the guitar neck has too much of a curve, you would need a new neck. But that isn\u2019t the only cause of high action. Sometimes a fretboard can be worn down after years of playing. Replacing the fretboard would be the fix for that scenario. Most of the time, adjustments to the bridge height can be made and it may be necessary to have the nut adjusted as well. The risk is that taking off too much material can create buzzing or other playability issues. Because this is delicate work, it should be done by a luthier. I would suggest taking the guitar for evaluation before trashing it/buying a new one. ",
