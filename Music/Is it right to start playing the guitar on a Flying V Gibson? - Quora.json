            "answer_text": "Not really. I know that any decent guitar is good enough to learn on, but there\u2019s a reason why the Flying V and similar V-bodies guitars won\u2019t work as well. It\u2019s not the best guitar in terms of ergonomics. First off, you really can\u2019t play the Flying V sitting down, and if you\u2019re practicing, you\u2019re probably gonna be sitting down. Now, people will say that you can hook the groove of the V onto your leg. Yes that works, but the fact is that your fretting hand is still keeping the guitar up from falling. When you are learning, you want your hands and arms to be relaxed, and if your fretting hand is doing most of its work keeping a guitar upright, then that\u2019s not relaxed and it\u2019s not good for technique and posture. Now let\u2019s consider playing standing up. It\u2019s actually okay to learn this way, except it will tire you faster when you\u2019re standing up. Again, not so much an issue, but when learning, you want to be relaxed and you want to conserve your energy. After all, you want to spend most of your energy on learning, not carrying a guitar. It is important to note though that depending on how high you strap on the guitar and the angle you use it, a person may find that the wing of the guitar may interfere with the picking forearm. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Flying V are beautifully guitars but hard to practice with\u2026 You always have to stand up and play that beauty\u2026 Maybe get it when you get a second guitar\u2026 Checkout Fender Stratocasters, they are very comfortable playing sitting down or standing up\u2026 They also come in many price ranges and you can get many different sounds from them\u2026 If you can't afford an American Stratocaster, go for a Mexican Stratocaster\u2026 I have one and she plays very well really close to an American Stratocaster\u2026 Only difference I see and hear is the American Stratocaster has better hardware\u2026 Best thing to do is go to a guitar store and play many different guitars and find one that feels and looks good to you\u2026 Once you find the one take to in store repair shop and have them check it out for you\u2026make sure the neck is straight and that all the pickups, electronics, toggle switch and tuners are in good working\u2026 Once you buy have the repair shop set up and intonated, cost between $25-$50, usually comes with free strings\u2026 The set up deals with how high you want the strings to be\u2026 The intonation deals with proper tuning with the guitar\u2026 Have fun playing\u2026 ",
