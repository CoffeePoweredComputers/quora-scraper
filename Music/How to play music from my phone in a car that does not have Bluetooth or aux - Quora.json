            "answer_text": "There are two methods. A Bluetooth transmitter can take your phone\u2019s Bluetooth output and convert it into an FM frequency that you can tune with your radio. A second method for those with cassette transports is a fake cassette tape with contacts on it to transmit the headphone signal from your phone to your cassette deck\u2019s playback heads. Both methods absolutely SUCK and are not worth the money, imo. However the Bluetooth transmitter concept could be acceptable if manufacturers would build an acceptable product. So far, everything I\u2019ve tried or read about is junk. Part of the problem is that it would be expensive to do this properly and there is concern that consumers would not like the pricetag. The dummy cassette method shall remain eternally horrible and should always be avoided. Easy answer? Have a new radio installed. Keep your old one for when you sell your car. The radio doesn\u2019t have to be much but it must have an aux jack and/or superior Bluetooth or WiFi capabilities so that your phone works well in the car. ",

            "answer_text": "Use a radio transmitter interface. They are inexpensive. Plug your phone into it; set it playing; tune your car radio into the transmitted signal and enjoy. Most of these devices transmit on the FM band. Some use the AM band. Not surprisingly, ones on AM will not transmit in stereo. I find that placing the device closer to your car aerial may he necessary for good reception; they are low power devices. In such a case, use a long cable so that the phone is within reach for control when you park to change your music\u2026 most car aerials nowadays seem to be at the back of the car\u2026 ",
