            "answer_text": "China bans so much of South Korean content due to tensions in the government. China doesn\u2019t approve of anything, well, \u201cun-Chinese,\u201d basically. Since China and Korea are tense due to Korea deploying an American missile defense system, China doesn\u2019t want to promote anything Korean because they don\u2019t agree with what Korea is doing politically. They also won\u2019t want Korea to be benefiting off of the entertainment market in their country. Also, China has to sign off on all of the content that enters the country, including the Kpop concerts, merchandise, Kdramas, etc. Most recently, however, China is starting to loosen its ban on Kpop and Korean entertainment. This could be a step towards a less difficult relationship between Korea and China. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the THAAD, and also because Chinese government was worried about the Korean entertainment industry affecting the Chinese entertainment industry too much. It was banned for 18 months - as of Nov 2017 it has not been banned, and Kpop concerts are supposedly being planned for late 2018 / early 2019 already. I personally think this was an overreaction by the Chinese government, but many Chinese people have justified this by saying \u201cKorea chose USA over China and this is their punishment\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I agree but anyways I\u2019m glad that its unbanned now.
