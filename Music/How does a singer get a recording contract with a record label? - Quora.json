            "answer_text": "There\u2019s really no formula, any more. Labels don\u2019t tend to want a ton of artists they need to invest time and money developing so they typically gravitate towards those who already have established fans, some EPs or albums recorded, and a fairly efficiently running career already. Those who can draw a decent crowd to a show in a number of cities, sell merch, and prove that they have a real-world following and not just social media numbers that present well. 200k+ Twitter followers aren\u2019t very useful if they don\u2019t support an artist\u2019s career, buy music and merch, and invest real time and money in the act. Labels (typically) want what seem to be pretty successful acts by most people\u2019s estimations. Why do I keep using the word typically? Because there are always going to be exceptions. ",
