            "answer_text": "Not exactly in the lyrics, but here's an interesting story about Sam Cooke's A Change Is Gonna Come. Sam Cooke wrote this song after being imprisoned for \"disturbing the peace\" after refusing to leave a Holiday Inn when they tried to kick his band out. He was scared of the song because it came to him suddenly and seemed really ominous. He asked his friend what it sounded like and he told him \"it sounds like death\" meaning he thought they'd kill him for the song. So Cooke only performed the song 1 time to a live audience. Just a month after its release and rapid use in the civil rights movement he was caught in a situation in which he was accused of rape by a prostitute who robbed him and then was shot dead by a woman across the hall he suspected was hiding the girl. The woman who claimed to have been raped by him was later charged with second degree murder of her boyfriend. This man had a really tragic life but I believe in some ways it all culminated into this one song. It was a song he feared but ultimately it was one of the songs that immortalized him past the 33 years he existed on this earth.  ",
