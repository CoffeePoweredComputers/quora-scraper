            "answer_text": "Certainly. Film score soundtracks are getting very popular now simply as casual listening music, and many of them are atonal. I don\u2019t particularly like the word \u201catonal\u201d as it means too many different things to different people, so it has to be carefully defined. A lot of people from a Western concert music background only admit 12-tone serialism as \u201catonal\u201d, which I think is unnecessarily narrow, and will limit the music in that definition to Schoenberg and his ilk. But if you define it as \u201clacking a central tonal centre\u201d then a lot of jazz, some prog rock, much more classical concert music, and a bunch of film soundtracks start to make their appearance. Much of this is eminently listenable, and to those who want a programmatic aspect to their music (\u201cit should be ABOUT something\u201d) then it certainly fills the bill. ",

            "answer_text": "It's very difficult, but if you can it becomes some of the most interesting music you will ever listen to (if it's good that is). Of course, there are compositions like Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring that are actually quite easy to enjoy even if you haven't enjoyed much atonal music before, but those compositions are few and far between. I would recommend listening from the early romantic period (like Beethoven) and working up to Schoenberg and the like. The further you progress from those earlier composers the more you'll enjoy dissonance. Here's a quick guide: Beethoven - String quartets 12, 13, 14, 15 and the Gro\u00dfe Fuge. Berlioz - Symphonie Fantastique movement Liszt - Faust symphony Wagner - Prelude to Tristan und Isolde, Liebestod and Brunnhilde\u2019s Immolation scene Schoenberg - Verlarkte Nacht (this is tonal, don't be scared!) Debussy - Prelude \u00e0 l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune (Prelude to the afternoon of a Faun) (Richard) Strauss - Final scenes from Salome and Elektra Schoenberg - Erwartung Erwartung is the first atonal piece on this list. It will be challenging when you first listen to it, but hopefully by the time you reach this piece you will be accustomed to dissonance and complex use of the orchestra. Have fun! ",
