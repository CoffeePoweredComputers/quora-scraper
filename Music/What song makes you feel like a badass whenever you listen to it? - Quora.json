            "answer_text": "\u201c46 & 2\u2033 by Tool I will try to defy physics in the explanation of this impossibility of the song that conjures such a pure, badass vigor. First, the listener hears tremendous emotional growth from the narrator's perspective, a drive to evoke emotion beyond all compare. That gushing force pumped up in violence, propelled from ear buds once silence, and she images them deep in her ears, with the backing rise of Justin Chancellor's lines, and with Danny Carey's bizarre drum beats were a prize, she listened so deeply, the song sang discretely, but began to the flicker with a fuse. The spectator, smiled, the smile of a child, and the music it took her on her way. Things then start shifting, gaining mass, and onnecteing, they are grander than the sum of their parts. Sliding from almost nothing, reaching on and on, touching, until the listener clenched her fists, she declared, this is a majestic feat. The driving bass riff a magnum opus, its own love it'd bring: a masterpiece of the thick-strings, it creates, density of the bass, standalone, but a meshing of notes, through such tone! Somehow separate, yet entirely whole, she'd check: the sound, an immovable object. Then, somewhere in the background, twirling through the snares and the vacuum, the vocal dynamo of rock out blasted her world, and she savored the shock, the vigilant listener swirled with the flock, as if the Divine Choir led her on a stage. Upwards. Engaged, the rhythm, it banged, and her fandom increased as Maynard James sang. Living by the blood-driven infusion and rises of grand-plucking Adam Jones droned, a master of courageous six-string licks, and she bonded with rising forces of the drumsticks, the vocals, and the electric strings that gave birth to, a sprite of magik, this night, in the ambient background, observed. Sounds single, they mingled, somewhat separated from bass! The lead of the forces at play. The strength and vitality the center of gravity, or bass, holding our listener down. Then twisting, and swinging, she shot through like lightning, closer and closer to the sky. She let her lungs breathe, to take in such love, the unstoppable surroundings above. Then, we have it. That bass, Justin Chancellor's barbaric cry\u2014the impossible beat is upon us\u2014 the immovable object never loses its new push into it's ferocious forte. As the bass holds her, gently, higher into the muse's directed air. No impurities afoot, ascension without foot, we have the orbit of Carey\u2019s varied time sign. The toms and cymbals in a love unconditional, the listener, she clutches her heart. Those beats, somehow possible, begin to meld with the vocals of a mastermind, high in the Choir of cherubs. The ability to take in the fuel, pumped by the rhythmic tenacity of one, Maynard James Keenan, our listener in such a daze. The singing, but lonely, no solo crooning phony, but instead leads stitched with golden thread. Twisted buy these wizards, to one man's dazzled fingers, they fit in a pitch so complete. Adam Jones cruises on with his guitar\u2019s grandiose swells, edging evermore toward the bass tune, the notes fell. His palm-muted matching is strong with his axe, but when it catches the vocals, ensnared with the trap set, the stitching enriches her mind. She's now in ascension alone and with tension, in orbit she longs for their meet. This trifecta, beginning to close in on that grandiose bass. The guitar gently releases the muted strung coils, and gives rise to gain, and a great gritty fix. That process, so timely, but featured sublimely, allows Tool, maestros of means, the band, ever-grand, breeds listeners, flocking, who stoked its own paradox scene. A goal to unlock the mystical thoughts, the potential building blocks of all life! To take a sole soul, and hear \u201cViva! Please won't you play more!\u201d for fans and fans by the score, the song develops its pieces in play. Now, bass, all alone, mighty mass, at the throne, the orbiting sounds set their course. Their velocity, vicious is now an irresistible force. As the four entities collide, all the instruments rhyme, and our listener inside freed her mind. Just one girl in the world, the listener belts alongg with a piece of her live for the world. She has been coaxed out with enriched sounds, freed of submission to the ground, emboldened, she listened and was freed. Memories locked after the mass hitting mass. She set down her ear piece, and opened her curtains with pride. Far down below, the collision took hold, and she\u2019d heard impossibility, now bona fide, an immovable object, an unstoppable force, she stared at the sky, and asked \u201cWhy? Why did the music create polished enthusiasts, who created pure powers that collide.\u201d The Irresistible Force Paradox took its course, generating impossible noise, and the listener smiled, her blood pumping wild, and with poise, the girl understood it, the answer, and sang it in pleasure and in glee she stepped from the world.
