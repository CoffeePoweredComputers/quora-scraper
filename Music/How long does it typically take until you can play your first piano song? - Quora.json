            "answer_text": "It's great that your first song is one you know. That helps a ton. A lot of us - me, for example - started when we were very young at our parents' insistence and were just taught to play boring, trivial songs out of \"lesson books\". They start with whole notes and one note at a time and not moving your hands at all, things like that. According to my teacher when I was 6, I learned a song on my first lesson. It went \"C D E, E D C, C D E D C' with the words \"this is up, this is down, this is up and down\". Not really what you're looking for.I hardly remember how long it took to be playing \"real\" music, as a result, because I didn't do it in a very sensible order. I didn't have anything I wanted to learn because I had never even listened to music before. On the plus side, lots of things I learned back then are now ingrained in my head at the same level as arithmetic or English. I know it was less than two years before I learned the opening section of \"fur elise\", which is the first thing I actually remember playing. So even a six year old can make pretty quick progress, I guess. Instead, I'll give you some advice as to how to approach that piece. It's great that you know it, as I said, because you'll know when it's right or wrong and you'll have a standard of \"how well you're playing it\". I wasn't so lucky: when I started out I didn't know what music was, hardly, and I had no idea what it was supposed to sound like.  It's also fantastic that you're learning at 21. Everyone who thinks it would be fun to play an instrument should learn early in their life, if they can. It pays off many times the effort you put in after a while, when you get the hang of learning new things. That said, I should warn you: that piece is going to be sort of tough to start with. It has thirds (pairs of notes two-apart in one hand) that go by pretty quick, and it involves moving your hands around in the middle of arpeggios. All of this is perfectly learnable, but be careful as you go. Don't bullshit stuff. Make sure you're playing things right, not almost right, as you learn them. The right part will be tricky, so learn it slowly, and try to get the left and right parts together early on so you don't get to that rut of \"I just can't make my hands do different things\" that a lot of self-learners get. I don't know if you can read music at all. If you can't, you'll be doing a lot of searching for notes on the keyboard at first. Some electric keyboards have ways of showing you what note you're playing, which should be helpful. Make sure you don't get confused by the clefs (the curly symbols at the start of each staff (each set of five lines, that is)). They mark \"treble\" and \"bass\" clef, but this song starts with both in the treble clef, so they're reading the same notes. The left hand only goes to bass clef at measure 16. You're going to have awful \"technique\" at first, but here are some pointers:  don't play with the flat parts of your fingers. Make sure they're sort of \"arched\" so the pad is on the key, not the whole finger. It'll be impossible to play fast otherwise. There's some leeway with your thumb.Use all your fingers. That chord in the right hand in measure two will probably be 1-3-5 (which is thumb, middle, pinky). The third at the end of the first measure will be 2-4 (index-ring) and the note before will probably just be 3. You'll want to practice going between those quickly until you don't screw it up. anymore. You're going to have to jump to get the 3 on that starting note. If you were more experienced, I'd recommend a more complicated fingering where that isn't necessary (use the thumb instead by curling it under from the note before, or use 5), but for a beginner I'd say: just use the pedal to make it sound smooth. But if it's tough, by all means, experiment with fingerings to find the one that works best for you, and then play it with the same fingers every time thereafter.The notation \"ped.\" and \"*\" under the left hand staff says \"start pedal here -> stop pedal here\". Then it says \"pedal simile\". This all means, really, to just hold down the sustain pedal for every two measures. Digital pianos typically only have one pedal, but if you ever move to a real piano it'll probably have three, so you might want to be aware that the rightmost pedal is the equivalent of the one you'll have on your keyboard.Try to do everything fluidly and not jerking around your hand. For example, the right hand in measure one is an 'arpeggio\" that plays the notes of a chord one-at-a-time. Your hand shouldn't be really moving while you play it - at least, not more than a slight \"flow\" to move down when the notes go down and move up when the notes go up. If it sounds really jerky, like \"note! note! note! note! note! note! chord!\", focus on making it sound more like a singer: \"dah-da-da-da-da-da-chord\".Try not to hit the sides of keys with your fingernails and stuff. If it \"feels\" like bad technique, it probably is.",

            "answer_text": "I had a very similar experience! I always wanted to learn piano since I was a kid and only started learning when I was 19. And this was my very first song:  I kid you not. If you're familiar with To Zanarkand (which is the specific piano piece asked in this question) you will understand that this piece is few levels harder than that. And how did I accomplish such feat? 1. Have a mentor Most important part. I started my lesson when I was 19 specifically because I had a flatmate who owned a piano (and played very well). One fine day, he randomly played One Winged Angel and I was intrigued. He agreed to teach me how to play this song. Note that I didn't ask him to teach me how to play piano. I asked him to teach me how to play this song. 2. Live close to a piano You already have a piano? Great! Because it's important that you play the piece every single day. 3. Forget about the basics When I started learning, I couldn't read a note. My fingers were all over the places and they never sounded right. But you know what? That didn't matter for my purpose. I didn't care about playing piano the correct way. I wanted to play One Winged Angel. I asked my friend countless time on how to play some certain part. I memorize them. I started learning how to read piano sheet just because I didn't want to bother him all day. My friend told me that my fingers was wrong, but I didn't care. It sounded right and was easier to memorize! 4. Start with the right-hand When learning a piece, I always start with the right-hand part. Why? The right-hand part of a piano piece usually plays the melody and it's what people usually pay attention to. It gives you instant gratification which in turns gives you a sense of progress and the motivation to do more. I also tend to put more effort to memorize the right-hand part because I can improvise the left-hand one. When I was learning  One Winged Angel, my friend gave me a dumbed version of the left-hand part so I can easily play it with similar sound. 5. Muscle memories I played one part vigorously until I memorize it. Right-hand, left-hand, then combined. One measure took me two weeks. Eventually it got better because I understood the song better and there were repetitions. After 4 months of playing everyday, roughly 4 hours a day, I managed to memorize the whole song. I could play left-hand part of this piece with eyes closed. 6. You can only play one song I could play One Winged Angel beautifully, but I didn't understand a single chord to accompany my sister's singing. But that's to be expected since I optimized my learning to learn one particular song. And to specifically answer your question: I learned To Zanarkand in 3 weeks. Without mentor. And it was my 4th song. ",
