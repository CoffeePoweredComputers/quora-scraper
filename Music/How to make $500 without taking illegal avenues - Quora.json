            "answer_text": " Ah, the joy of making money! If you live in the United States (which I presume you do), making $500 is a very easy and obtainable task, legally, for even the beginners in the \"game\".  While the most common answer you'll get to this answer is; get a job! it is interesting to take a look at how quite easy it is to obtain a total of $500 from a simple, minimum wage job requiring no experience at all. Let's take the lowest of the low, McDonald's! From 15-year olds to 40-year olds (maybe even older!) McDonald's are always looking to hire new hands to flip their, fabricated, meat. Not surprisingly, as they open new venues nearly every month. They're everywhere. I'm not going to go into detail about your job and adventures of working at McDonalds, but I will tell you that they pay a minimum of $7-$12 per hour (depending on your state). On average, you'll work about 6-8 hours a day, 5 (maybe, probably 6) days a week. That's about $56-$96 a day. 5-6 days a week, it's going to take you at most 1 2/3 weeks to 1 week to make over $500! Not too hard, right? The great capitalistic society of America! Now just take off some dough for taxes ;) But let's say you don't have a week to make $500. Let's throw it out there that you need that $500, like ... right now. I get it. Maybe you need to pay the bills, or take a special someone to a big, big shopping spree to get a little ... okay, forget that, but I get it. You need the $500, and you aren't cut out for jail, or aren't much of a runner for when the cops bust you in the act. But cutting back to your question. There's a great, untapped way of making $500 ... LEGALLY! Broadcast Your SkillsWhat do you do, best? Maybe it's a sport, maybe it's something to do with PC's. Whatever it is, it can be used to make you money. Say you're a computer engineer; you specialize in fixing computers. Bam, with a little backsweat and will, you can crop up well over $500 by going house to house and fixing broken, or slow computers (big market for these suckers! We all know first hand). Let's say you charge just $60 a computer, you would only have to fix 9 computers to meet your goal of $500. It may sound like a long stretch, like how the hell will you find 9 computers to fix in a day? If you came to my house, today, and offered to fix my slow as hell desktop, and trust me I love working on desktops, I'd whip out $60 to get your house service. I mean, you're right at my door! There's plenty of people who would do the same. Obviously, everyone isn't a computer engineer, but that's okay. Like I've already said, America is a capitalistic society! It's made for one thing, and one thing only; making MONEY! This is entrepreneurial heaven. You have to find what you can do best, and use it for yourself to make money. That's what people with money did, before they had money. Some made money with their idea, skill or plan faster than others, and visa versa.    Pretend your homeless!Meet Gary Thomas, a Texan who makes over $100,000 a year pretending to be physically handicap. No, this is not considered fraud concur to popular belief. Begging, despite your background, has and always will be legal. This guy makes almost $500, at an average of $270/day.. sometimes more than others. But in a happening, wealthy city, with a good gag, you have a good chance at racking in over $500. Rent Out a Spare Room, or more!This option is so overlooked by people striving for the extra buck (in your case, 500 extra bucks), that it's pretty much one of the most valuable untapped, tapped, sources in common day America. Assuming you have a house with more than one vacant bedroom or room (guest room, living room, etc.), that's money sitting on the floor ... for the right person. If you are fine with living with a stranger, then it's for you. While rent varies for how nice your place is, how nice the area and how accessible it is to what the renter is looking for, you can't forget about the deposit renters require all around the United States. Simply charge them $300-$500 down for the place, PLUS the first month (and maybe even the last month) rent. Easy! Now you have your initial goal of $500 easily obtained, with a lot left over. Offer your time in Advance for immediate paymentYou'll find this fairly easy, because it's really benefiting the employer rather than you, however, it's a great way to get the $500 you need, right now. Simply offer an employer to work every single weekend for the rest of the year, but only if they pay you the $500 right now, today ... money in hand. You'll find a lot of people willing to do this!  Offer yourself for $500 (no, not like that!)I'm sure, hopefully, we've all had that one girl/guy obsessed with us. They would DIE to go on a date with you. Well, might as well capitalize on it. Offer them a date, but ONLY if they pay you $500. This is PERFECTLY legal as long as both parties agree the payment is for the company, and nothing else. You truly are getting desperate if you go to this step. Buy a lottery ticketBecause, it never hurts to try! And you'll end up making a lot more than just $500 if you win. (Unless you don't have the money, then just forget this) Take a loanIf your credit is good, there's nothing holding you back from taking out a $500 loan, right now (unless the banks closed!). You will have to pay it back, obviously, but hey ... that's $500 in your hands the same day. Obviously this doesn't work if you are trying to get money to pay back a loan, lol. So, those are some great ways you can get $500, maybe even more. I think that pretty much covers every way possible. Now, go out and make that money! ",
