            "answer_text": "It depends on the context and the style of music. Rock music often uses power chords instead of full chords. When played in unison with a bass player, they can create a powerful statement. If you are playing with another chordal instrument - like a piano - power chords can keep you from stepping on each other\u2019s toes. But in that case, you may as well not play at all - or play very sparsely. And there are other, more useful approaches. Power chords are not really chords at all. They are just the root note and the fifth. Only two notes. Like C and G. They are a way of hinting at a chord without making any commitment. With only two notes, we don\u2019t know if the music is major or minor. It has no character. This can be useful in some situations. A chord has three notes. The root note, the third note in the scale and the fifth note. The third note makes it major or minor. Generally, major chords are considered \u201chappy\u201d or positive and minor chords are considered \u201csad\u201d. Minor chords and minor keys are used a lot in Blues. A \u201cC Major\u201d chord contains the notes C E G. The \u201cC minor\u201d chord contains the notes C Eb G. Without that middle note, you can\u2019t tell if the chord is major or minor. Blues and Jazz rely heavily on four note chords. A major seventh C chord would use the notes C E G B. You are more likely to find this chord in Jazz, though it can appear in other styles, like Pop. A dominant seventh C chord would use the notes C E G Bb. This type of chord is used all the time in Blues and many other styles of music. Four note chords add color to the chord. This usually creates a more complex emotion than simply happy or sad. Bar chords are generally simple triads - three note chords. On Guitar, this means that some notes in a chord are repeated at different octaves. The same is true of open chords. An open G chord includes the notes G B D G B G. If you also held down the second string at the third fret, you would get G B D G D G. Some players do not sound all six strings when playing a chord. They prefer not to play the same note more than once. They may only pluck three or four strings to outline a chord, depending on the chord they are playing. When playing with a bass player, it is possible to indicate a chord with only two notes. In this case, it is not necessary to play the root note if that is what the bass player is playing. In the example of a C Major chord, the bass player could play a C and a guitarist could just play the notes E and G. Jazz and other players use this technique at times but they tend to use the third and seventh of the chord. The bass player plays a C and the guitarist plays an E and a B to outline a C Major chord. I know this is more than a simple yes or no answer. That\u2019s because music is more complex than that. This is what gives it its power. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess they can, but the question and any answer needs some qualification. Barre chords would be any chord using holding several notes with one finger (usually the first) and that shape is movable giving different chords based on the root. The first barre chord usually learned is the F chord, which is a movable E shaped chord with a barre above it. With this one movable chord, the guitarist can make a Major (1,3,5), Minor (1,b3,5), Dominant Seven (1,3,5,b7), Minor Seven (1,b3,5,b7), Major Seven (1,3,5,maj7), Minor Major Seven (1,b3,5,maj7), Sixth (1,3,5,6) or which without damping is more likely a Thirteenth (1,3,5,6,b7), sus4 (1,[3],4,5), or sus2 (1,2,[3],5), or those two with b7\u2014simply by lifting the little finger and placing it elsewhere\u2014Nineth (1,3,5,b7,9), Eleventh (1,[3],5,b7,11), Thirteenth (1,[3],5,b7,13), Augmented (1,3,#5), Diminished (1,b3,b5) and both those two have sevenths, or a Hendrix favorite Seventh/Sharp Nineth (1,3,5,b7,#9). I hope I remembered the formulas correctly; I\u2019m sure I left some out. And that doesn\u2019t count the several places on the fingerboard to play each one. A Power Chord is another term for a 5-Chord. It begins by looking like a barre chord, but doesn\u2019t play the whole chord. Sometimes I showed it as a cheater \u201cchord.\u201d It misses some of the formula; the 5-Chord has this formula: (1,5 or 1,5,1). See how much could be missing? A chord has been defined as \u2018at least three different notes played at once.\u2019 The 5-Chord only has two. It might be used, in the place where another is called for, but it doesn\u2019t really substitute for it. You can write songs using 5-Chords\u2014and many today do\u2014but these aren\u2019t substitutes. Do that, but understand what you\u2019re doing and what you could be doing. In fact, after playing a while, I learned that \u201csubstitute\u201d was used with a different meaning. Imagine a song with |G / / / / |C / / / / |D / / / / |D / / / / |G / / / / |/ / / / | Some might \u201csubstitute\u201d different whole chords in certain places; they had related or notes leading to the next chord. For example: Am or Am7 for the last two beats of the measure beginning with C, then adding a D7 before returning to G. |G / / / / |C / /Am / / |D / / / / |D7 / / / / |G / / / / |/ / / / | There are a whole lot\u2014books\u2014of suggested substitutions. Often they occur a few beats before a chord change. So, can power chords substitute barre chords? No. One might try to play a power chord in the place of a barre chord, but they don\u2019t substitute for them. Keep playing and learn some more. Good question. ",

            "answer_text": "In broad general music theory terms, bar chords are complex chords. Power chords are the harmonic backbone of Western music, built on 1st, 4th, and 5th tones of a major scale. So, the answer depends on your creative goal. In arranging/ composing, complex chords impress me as offering creative opportunities to use them for musical color, special effect, and what you happen to find, if you experiment. Wikipedia has an interesting entry on this. On the other hand, if you are interested in staying within specific style restraints, you should respect those restraints, unless you wish to try to stretch the style. Stepping outside common style restraints risks criticism and potential rejection. Just ask Beethoven, but remember, his critics were outnumbered by his admirers. ",
