            "answer_text": " Of the \"double A-side\" notion, and of the two released songs, this one, I Don't Know is the one I like the most. It is a contemplative, somewhat dreamy song in part and with a quality of melancholy. I find it the most interesting of the two because of its mood and depth. In audio terms, it sounds lovely and wistful, but this is a song that possesses an authenticity about it, one which couldn't have been written before now. Whether this is Paul, allowing a more personal expression to come to the fore, in these later years, one can only speculate. There is an oblique quality to the lyric which gives room for interpretation and reflection, like true poetry does. It 'feels' more personal and intimate and this is the McCartney I love, when he isn't playing to the gallery. Paul is a natural showman and has never been overtly introspective in terms of his songwriting,although he has ventured more into that meditative arena since Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. There is much that one can say, critically, about the song, or rather its realisation. Paul's voice is the voice of someone who has been round the block, with all the qualities of a man who has embraced life fully. Like an old single malt whisky, he gives us his best shot and it is tempered with the effects of time. The piano melody is exquisite and emotionally evocative; from the outset, there is no question that we're being allowed into a more intimate space, where nothing is wrapped up tight and certain. I like the fact that has an openness to it, without a tidy resolution. i would be very interested to hear what others think about the song and it's subject matter. In terms of its meaning, there are many readings within the words. One interpretation could be that the surety of regret, of sorrow and longing in Yesterday has become an uncertainty in this song. There is a sense of loss within I Don't Know, which leaves the protagonist, who is surely McCartney, feeling ambivalent about pain, love and coping. He is at the centre of it, an imperfect man, facing an uncertain future, with world-weary bravery. I think that this is an important song, probably the most important in a very long time. It is a long way from toe tappers and crowd pleasers; this is a McCartney for now, and, you know what\u2026..maybe I am amazed! ",
