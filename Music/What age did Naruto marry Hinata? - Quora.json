            "answer_text": "I write this before reading the updated Naruto wikia. 19 Years old if i calculate it correctly. The Last Movie taken place 2\u20133 years after the war. so Naruto is 18 Years old. and then let\u2019s assume they dated for 1 year and then they have the first child around 20 years. Boruto is 12 years old Genin when chapter 700 coming in and Naruto at that time looks early 30s. let\u2019s say it\u2019s 32 years old so.. And Chunnin min. 12 years old. 32 - 12 = 20 years old = First child. 19 is the answer! which is very young age for married couples. (And we all know Naruto wouldn\u2019t hold back to make a child with Hinata after they married lol) ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s think about this logically. Now, the Fourth Great World War ended on Naruto\u2019s seventeenth birthday, alright? Then, during the Shikamaru Hiden arc, Shikamaru mentioned the war has been over for two years, so we can estimate Naruto is nineteen years old here. Now, we have The Last: Naruto the Movie not too long after THAT; so we can guess he is still nineteen. We can safely say he and Hinata married a year later, so he is now twenty years old. ",
