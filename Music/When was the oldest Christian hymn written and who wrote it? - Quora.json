            "answer_text": "It depends exactly what you mean by a \u2018hymn\u2019, which simply means as song of praise. As has been said, the psalms are the oldest hymns and are still in vigorous use as such. Some scholars see fragments of hymns buried in some of the New Testament epistles. One ancient hymn from early Christian times is \u2018phos hilarion\u2019 - \u2018hail gladdening light\u2019, an anonymous verse dating from maybe 290AD. \u2018Modern\u2019 hymns - verses of fixed metre with a repeated tune - seem to date from the time of St Ambrose (340-397AD). Most mainline hymn books contain a few hymns claiming Ambrose as their author. ",

This is not surprising, since the earliest Christians were all Jews (as was Jesus). In the Catholic Church, we still sing the Psalms every Sunday if there is sufficient musical accompaniment (otherwise, the Psalms are read rather than sung). ",
