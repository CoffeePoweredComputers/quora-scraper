            "answer_text": "I'm probably going to be the only guy on here that will say yeah, you are kinda late. There are so many kids out there who start when they're 12, and are on tour by they time they're 16.  My cousin was touring as a shoegaze band when he was 15 and that went on for years. At 22, there's gonna be a tonne of college grad kids who already played heavy in college and used that to wheel girls, and played at the school bars and had that whole experience.  You're going to meet guys with a decade plus of musical instrument training etc, who've been in orgies. So yeah you're kinda late, and I think all the guys on here who are saying you're not are just way older and don't remember how old 22 is (I'm 25 I feel pretty old).   Doesn't mean you can't start, just expect everybody else in your age group to be way ahead of you and a lot more experienced.  Instruments take years to learn how to play effectively so just be down to grind it out.   I played in a small punk band when I was 12 years old, and started guitar at 11 so I know how this feels.  I'm 25 now and still learning scales properly. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an old posting, but its still relevant. It would depend on what genre you are targeting, and what your goals are, obviously, but generally speaking, no. If you're original, and innovative, it doesn't matter how old you are. Look at it this way\u2026 even though Jimmy Page was very young when he started paying his dues being a session musician, and eventually joining the Yardbirds, his real big break forming Zeppelin didn't happen until his 30\u2032s. Now, on could argue \u201cbut that was the 60\u2032, and Rock was still fairly new, and fresh.\u201d But the thing is, in all music, especially today, you are only limited by your talent, commitment, and creativity. I say that because years ago, to get a break, you needed to get discovered by an exec, or pay a lot of money for management and promotion, whereas today with the internet\u2026.many artists self manage, promote, produce\u2026everything. It does take skill, commitment, and vision, but age is not such a factor anymore, as you can tailor your target audience to suit you in many ways. Just play honestly to yourself, hone your sound, image, etc. And the rest will follow. ",
