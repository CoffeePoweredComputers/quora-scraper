            "answer_text": "Sure, why not? But it needs a bit of tweaking to sound good. IV-vi-I-V is how this would be notated, not \u201c4615\u201d. That\u2019s important because the distinction between upper and lower case signifies the distinction between major and minor chords. It would look like this in the key of C: F => Am => C => G Let\u2019s break that down into the individual notes: F-A-C => A-C-E => C-E-G => G-B-D Now play it on your instrument. It makes a pleasant sequence of chords but it doesn\u2019t \u201cgo anywhere\u201d, does it? What I mean is this. Our ear might pick up a pattern in the first three steps and anticipate a fourth step (\u201cHey, this is going to land on \u2026\u201d) but the fourth step that we actually get neither satisfies the expectation (aka \u201cresolution\u201d) nor confounds it in a startling way. It just kinda stops. What I\u2019d consider is altering that fourth step so that we get a consistent pattern of two notes staying the same and one note changing, and we have the tonic (in this case, C) in the final step, creating a quasi-resolution with a pleasing element of surprise / unresolved tension. So \u2026 let\u2019s try replacing that G major with a Gsus4: F-A-C => A-C-E => C-E-G => G-C-D Now in each step you have two notes which are the same as the preceding chord and two which are the same as the following chord. You end on a Gsus4 (which is identical to a Csus2: C-D-G). Let\u2019s play it \u2026 Yep! To my ear at least, this sounds like a good progression. That final D, a major second interval above the tonic, is left hanging in space, a bit like ending a poem on a question mark. To sum up: All sequences of chords are possible; only some of them sound like a progression.Learn your diatonic scales: I-ii-iii-IV-V7-vi-vii\u02da-VIII uses the seven notes in your major scale in a beautiful harmonic progression; I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII-VIII sucks majorly.*Break the chords down into notes, so that your numbers actually become meaningful. They\u2019re not just arbitrary numbers!Recognise patterns and where they get disrupted.Trust your ear. That\u2019s the whole point of music, after all.\u2026\u2026\u2026 *Jazzers and classicists will point out that the seventh degree of the diatonic major scale is really vii7(\u266d5), but let\u2019s not get over-technical \u2026 ",
