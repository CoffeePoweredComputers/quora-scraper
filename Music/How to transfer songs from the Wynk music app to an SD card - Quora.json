            "answer_text": "Wynk music's songs are DRM protected so you can't easily move them wherever you want. There is a technique though to move them. The songs won't be named as usual as the names. They are named as codes so you are gonna have to play them by identifying the Album artwork meaning if you have more than 2 songs of same album, you should play them to know which is which. The technique to move them is found on Google so search there and in my opinion its not recommended. There's another option, you need root access to your phone and enabling write data to external sd card option after rooting. This option directly downloads music to SD card without any issues. You can use wynk as usual. ",
