            "answer_text": "I LOVED the ON era personally. But if you felt it was hollow or empty, my guess as to why is probably because of what happened in the world during it. That was the era when the pandemic was taking over everything and the world was shutting down. So performances of ON did not include a live audience. They were promoting the comeback, but it was sad. The fact they couldn\u2019t interact with an audience was sad. The world was sad. It\u2019s hard to look happy when you\u2019re facing empty seats. And maybe that was the vibe you felt. The tour got canceled/indefinitely postponed. Which then led to a complete upheaval in their schedule and their lives. And ours. So I am not surprised that you may feel that way about the ON era. It just probably has less to do with the actual music and more to do with the state of the world.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think so too. It is most likely due to the short promotion period, that they only promoted ON for a few weeks in music shows back in Korea. Their overseas performances are spectacular tho, not to mention performing \u201cON\u201d at The Tonight Show in Central station, and performing \u201cBlack swan\u201d barefooted at the Late Show. Also the way you mean \u201chollow\u201d or \u201cempty\u201d can be contributed to their outfits. It\u2019s not the most eye-catching or flashy in terms of colours, compared to their most recent comeback \u201cDynamite\u201d. But hey, you can\u2019t blame them- it suits the overall vibe of \u201cON\u201d, and I don\u2019t actually hate it. It just doesn\u2019t cater to mainstream audience. Anyways, I do feel the same way you do, and the ON era seems too underwhelming to some extent. It deserves more love and support! ",
