            "answer_text": "Yes. Ibanez is a very good brand of guitar.The things I like best about them are their consistent quality and their very reasonable prices. Anyone who\u2019s played a selection of 1970s Fenders for example, will know how much individual examples of ostensibly the same guitar can vary in terms of fit and finish, playability and sound. You can pick up pretty much any price point range of Ibanez and it will play well. Much like a Yamaha.If I\u2019m advising someone on purchasing their first electric guitar, then Ibanez is always at the top of the list. The reasonable prices are (I think) down to several factors. Firstly, the clever use of materials. A lot of Ibanez electrics have bodies that are quite compact, and slim. As well as making the guitar lighter and less tiring to wear, this also saves wood. You could probably get two Ibanez electrics out of the wood blanks used for a single Les Paul! Secondly, they use the same basic handful of designs, then produce models at all price points based on those. The higher up the range you go, the nicer will be the hardware, the wood finish and the inlaying, etc. Maybe a tremolo where the base model has a fixed bridge and such, but that base model guitar will still be built to the same quality, and available to you if you don\u2019t need or have the budget for any of the extra fancy stuff. Thirdly, economy of scale. Ibanez makes a hell of a lot of guitars in a year. They have refined and developed these models over many many years, so what you buy now is the culmination of all that experience. Ibanez know how to make a guitar very efficiently. They know what hardware is not only good at its job, but reliable and cost effective. They know that a slim neck is not only easier to play, but also cheaper to produce, because you get more necks per blank of wood. They know that if you want an angled headstock, then the most materials-efficient way to make it is to produce a flat neck, then join the headstock on afterwards. Gibson, for example, will machine the entire neck and headstock from one piece, which wastes a lot of wood.I guess you can sum it up as using traditional luthier craftsmanship with modern production engineering principles. You really can\u2019t go far wrong with any Ibanez. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, in term of brand recognition, Ibanez is very popular brand and it\u2019s probably one of the most recognizable Japanese guitar brands alongside with Yamaha, especially for it\u2019s Electric guitars. Ibanez is very popular with its RG electric guitar body shape which is used widely by metal guitarist and rock virtuosos. Its also popular with it\u2019s thin neck profile that supports fast playing and versatility which was firstly introduced among other guitars back in the day. The quality of Ibanez electric guitar is a really decent regardless what price point you\u2019re entering, but of course the more you scale up the more better you\u2019ll get. The more affordable Ibanez guitars are manufactured in Indonesia and china, this include standard pickup and hardware that are used in those guitars. The more expensive models are manufactured in Japan and some of them are in United States. Because it\u2019s popularity, Ibanez guitars are copied/replicated quite often (fake guitars) and its totally different case. Speaking about acoustic guitars, you should be careful before buying one because in general i think ibanez acoustic guitars quality is not that good (compared to its electric). I\u2019ve tried one of Ibanez\u2019s acoustic electric model which is priced around +$1000 and it uses a laminated top instead of solid top (which is considered better in the acoustic guitars world when it comes to wood selection) and of course it sounded thin acoustically. With that amount of money you can get a nicer sounding acoustic guitar. ",
