            "answer_text": "Modern pop music sucks because of the digital innovation, which came into place in the mid-1980\u2019s. Before digital, there was the understanding that the music business was run by musicians, and those musicians were expected to concertize, and to be able to playback their hits live, using real instruments. The advent of digital means that any person, even those lacking all musical talent and ability, can now create music that is automated by computers, essentially. Digital wizardry allows anyone to make something that roughly \u201csounds like music\u201d. Even a live performance can be totally, or partially, pre-programmed with synthesis. The MTV ethos also damaged the industry; prior to MTV, fans rarely cared too much what a musical act looked like. In fact, many, if not most, pop musicians were physically plain\u2026 But that was okay because it was their music that mattered. The radio was the prime medium of pop music, and in that environment, how a musician looked was of little or no consequence. Paul Simon has recently said that, were he and Art Garfunkel to be starting out today, they likely would not meet with success, because they were not especially handsome or dramatic-looking and did not dance. The MTV ethos convinced fans that the visual element of a pop act was as important\u2014 if not more important\u2014- than the music being made. In the 1960\u2019s, there were not a whole lot of supermodel-looking music acts, and when they DID crop up (like Jackie deShannon, Bobbie Gentry, Nancy Sinatra, Michelle Phillips, Grace Slick or Gayle McCormick) they were not automatically fawned over because they were beautiful, and you\u2019d better believe that audiences demanded that they prove themselves as powerful musicians first and foremost (which these six women did). Nowadays, with the world of synthesis and digital wizardry, a female popstar need not prove that she is a musical talent\u2026 because all her shortcomings can be easily fixed by digital technology. But she had better be hawt-looking, and I mean, all over. (And even her appearance can be tweaked endlessly on computers). The other thing that has damaged pop music is the Star Search/American Idol/Britain\u2019s Got Talent ethos. In the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, there was the feeling that music was best left up to the professionals\u2026 namely, musicians who could really sing and play. Starting in the 1980\u2019s, with TV shows like STAR SEARCH, et.al., suddenly music became a competition amongst amateurs. And very often the goal of these shows was to ascertain who could hold the highest note, or who could embellish their song with endless ghetto/gospel scat melismas. Soon, all that superficial posturing became far more important than the song itself, and songs that were subtle, sophisticated or delicate quickly became out-of-fashion, because they did not elicit wild applause on these \u201ctalent\u201d programs. As we know, anyone who can harness the power of the Internet, can grow very rich indeed. Starting in the mid-90\u2019s\u2014- coeval with the rise of the \u2018Net\u2014- certain popsong styles became etched in stone. There has been the feeling of, \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d, and basically no new pop song styles have arisen since the mid-1990\u2019s. If a particular sound and groove sell well, there is no impetus at all to change it or to try new musical ideas. AM and FM radio used to expose a relatively wide spectrum of musical styles to the listener; today, any listener can define a very narrow channel of styles he wants to listen to, and never be exposed to any style outside of that narrow channel. Country-Western music used to be about warmth and sincerity, but with the advent of Autotune technology, it is now as slick, superficial and anodyne as any other flavor of pop. Meanwhile, newer generations are being born who are raised on this new ersatz stuff, and who do not remember when pop music was real, assume that this new falsehood is simply the \u201cnew normal\u201d. AM and FM radio used to be the channels by which most people heard new pop music, and because those channels were so relatively narrow and limited, musicians and DJ\u2019s could assert some control, and limit what got heard by the public. With the advent of the \u2018Net and other digital media, all music formats have mostly been shattered, and there is an \u201canything goes\u201d ethos afoot, with musical subgenres proliferating\u2014 usually with absurd, pretentious or arbitrary characteristics. In other words, nowadays you have non-music performed by non-musicians in an endless galaxy of audio choices. This all but squelches out the genuine musician who writes and performs his own songs. Cream doesn\u2019t necessarily rise to the top anymore. Another factor in this current malaise\u2026 is that sincere at-home and at-school musical instrument learning has been greatly curtailed. Many high schools have discontinued their Music programs. Few young kids want to work hard, and for years, at learning the piano or guitar\u2026. when tricky digital instruments can simulate the sound FOR them. That\u2019s why Rap was born: it was thought that there was no further need for learning Melody, Harmony and Lyric-Writing. One could just shout over a synthetic drumbeat. Before Rap, pop music was most often about finding what was beautiful or singular or impressive about the human experience; after Rap, any subject matter, no matter how vulgar, crude, ephemeral or vicious became the style. Today, the only permissible emotions a popsinger may evince are 1). braggadocious sexual posturing, and 2). aggression/anger. All other emotions are taboo\u2026 thought to be wimpy. There are a host of reasons why most modern pop music is crap, but these are a few. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of reasons why pop music is bad. I am not saying all pop music sucks. But most of the pop music sucks. First of all. Music isn\u2019t for money. Music is an Art. We should treat music like that. Like many other things, maths, or writing music needs a lot of creativity. Money can\u2019t define creativity. Its true that musicians need money. We all need money. But dealing music for money isn\u2019t just the way. There are many examples of it. There are lots of rock musicians whose earliest stuffs were better. But from time to time they get worse. Its only because of they get hungry after money, they don\u2019t have the same passion they used to have when they weren\u2019t famous. Even artists like Elvis Presley became worse. I mean, when he came to music in his prime was very good. But he didn\u2019t show his creativity much in later songs. In pop music its even more common. All the commercial companies, need money. They don\u2019t treat music as music. They just wade music like circus. That\u2019s why they recruit some hot girls from tv channels. They promise themselves to make them pop-stars. Thus they become musicians. But music isn\u2019t just it. Everybody is different. People who were interested in acting shouldn\u2019t be doing music because of fame. And the commercials made the music worse. They don\u2019t have time for creating different types of music. They just need fast production. That\u2019s why they put a lot of same thing in songs. Thus songs become repetitive. And it gets worse.Another thing I have found on YouTube. I have seen so many things like that, Here he says that everybody\u2019s taste it different. But music companies are brainwashing us. He says that \u201cMost of the pop fans, who listen pop songs for the first time, they don\u2019t like them either. But from time to time they start to love it. Its because listening something all around us, makes us liking it. And they fall into a chain. Where they don\u2019t wanna find different variations of music but wanna stick to the same music they listen\u201d. And thus how music sucks. The thing that is bad, was pretty much there since the beginning. But it didn\u2019t spread like that. Back in the 50s, 60s or 70s there were bad music too. But those didn\u2019t get famous music people used to appropriate blues, rock or other types of music more. But from the 70s, it all started kinda become famous with punk rock. I won\u2019t say Punk rock is bad. But it wasn\u2019t creative comparing to other genres of music at that time. It became famous, then slowly the music industry started to promote those types of music instead of more creatively written music. The punk artists started to swear in their lyrics, short written lyrics, few chords playing. Yes, that was it. And now these things are spreading. But punk rock artists weren\u2019t like today. They still had passion, they wanted to show the world that they were tough. But unfortunately few things of their\u2019s influenced new music. And now music industry use them. Nobody has now time to write thousands lines of songs. Like people used to do one day. Why? Cause they didn\u2019t think of money. 1000 lines wouldn\u2019t matter to them. But now people think that \u201cInstead of writing a song with 100 lines, let\u2019s split the lines, increase the tracks and get more money\u201d. So, MTV is the father of these things. But like I said, there were always bad music. The guy above there said that when the beatles recorded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band it become famous, yes, but it also started to inspire pop music. Conclusion: So, there are lots of reasons why pop music suck. We can\u2019t only blame pop artists for that. Even rock musicians of that time made some influence on new pop music. Just wonder what if Led Zeppelin hadn\u2019t sing countless songs about sex. Its not like that they hadn\u2019t talent for writing songs like Stairway to Heaven. Why they had to sing about sex when playing music? They could simply sing about other things too. But what they did for fun started to become serious nowdays in music. So my point is that why pop music is bad because now pop is combining those things once that were bad things. ",
