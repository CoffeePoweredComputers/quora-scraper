            "answer_text": "If we decide to look at it the normal way which most of the people will decide to, then it is yes, they (our parents) made us feel bad but what if I tell you, there is another way (if we decide to) of looking at it, which can make us feel happy about it. Only to start with we have and need to admit that whatever we do to our parents no matter what it is or how big it might seem to be, can never compensate them even partially for what they have done to us or the what they have suffered with us to become what we have become today. Then we need to ask ourselves can we change the behavior of our parents at this age? If no then we need to ask another question: Do we have the authority over them to force them to change? Again it is absolutely no. Then we should start asking ourselves: what is in our equation that is variable? That we can change or replace? Consequently we realize it is the meaning (that we can change) we give to their criticisms or comments about us or the things we do. If we change the meaning to something like: I should not consider or feel anything as a reaction to their criticisms and comments as I take it as a release of their lives\u2019 frustration expressed through it to their loving daughter. Because you are the closest person to them and because they know they can get away with it with you, the only way they learned to do that release is through expressing it to you and you are mistakenly taking it personal. On the other hand also, don't forget that they are coming from different values and were having different dreams for themselves as well as for you and for your future. Maybe they have not fulfilled their dreams and you didn't fulfill their dreams about you(you might have taken another path in life than the one which they have planned it for you). So every time they criticize or attack you, consider it as a way of helping them removing some of their tensions and pressure. Be happy that you got the opportunity to reward them a little from what they have done to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Parents are just humans like us. They might have their own ideologies and perceptions to a certain subject based on their own experience with life. But if that makes you feel about bad about yourself then STOP !  There are two questions here which you need to ask to yourself- Does your parent's opinion matter a lot to you? and second Do they really understand you? If both the answers are yes ! then you should talk to them more often, make them understand your point of view and why they should not make you feel bad. Tell them that their opinions make you feel belittled. No parent would want that.  First be very sure, that you are doing the right things. Sometimes with lesser experience, we don't see the bigger picture. We don't try to see and other's opinion. So be sure you do that. Be sure you are right to yourself more than to anyone. And then just do what you want. Even when you are wrong, who learns without stumbling in the way. Sometimes parents do not understand us but trust me they do not hate their kids. It is just the perceptions differ from one generation to the other. They cannot make you feel bad about yourself if you do not want to. Love yourself and the things that you do , the world and your parents will subsequently start loving you for the same. Give everyone some time to understand you and your views.  Be what you are and learn to accept the views others offer. If you like it embrace it and if you don't then just carry on. You should not feel bad about yourself at all. Parents are important part of your life but they are not everything. They might scold you and hate you for a lot of things but they will never ever want you to fail. So just be more open and accept things the way they come.  Be brave and embrace all the positives and negatives that come your way. Hold your head high and love yourself. Always !! ",
