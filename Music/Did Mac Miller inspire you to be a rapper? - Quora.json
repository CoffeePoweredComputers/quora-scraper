            "answer_text": "I guess in a way, but not really. I don't have a solid one person that influenced me to be an emcee. There are, however, multiple rappers who've influenced me in certain (somewhat specific) ways. I wouldn't put Mac in the top rappers that inspired me. But his mixtape \u201cFaces\u201d influenced me by making it comfortable for me to rap about mental health, internal struggles, etc. (Which i incorporate in a few rhymes). Another, more prominent rapper, that influenced me in the same fashion as well as many other ways is Kanye. But anyways, I wouldn't say i started rapping bc of Mac Miller. But that doesnt take away of how great of a rapper he is, and he being one of my favorite rappers. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he definitely did. His albums good am, best day ever, and watching movies with the sound off were some of the many inspiring albums that I had on repeat during my psychadelic phase right before I started rapping seriously. His Good AM concert at Rialto theater in Tucson, AZ was one of the best concerts I have ever had the pleasure of attending. Mac definitely was a genuine dude who loved making music and I could tell that he really cared about his fans. He definitely inspired me to be a rapper and will be missed. RIP Mac :,) hes probably smoking a blunt in the clouds somewhere ",
