            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t consider his breakup songs, like \u201cDirge\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d, and pretty much Blood on the Tracks in its entirety, there are still a lot of great ones. Dylan\u2019s progression in love songs is very easy to be noticed. His few early love songs from The Freewheelin\u2019 are pretty simple and straight-forward, and they get better with time, specially 1964 (coincidentally when he met Sara Lownds), when we talk about one of my favorites of his: \u201cTo Ramona\u201d. Your cracked country lips I still wish to kiss As to be by the strength of your skin Also from 1964, \u201cBallad in Plain D\u201d isn\u2019t a love song, but a breakup song, and I feel like it\u2019s very underrated among Dylan fans. \u201cSpanish Harlem Incident\u201d is also a highlight. In 1965, almost marrying Lownds, he recorded other two I absolutely adore: \u201cLove Minus Zero/No Limit\u201d and \u201cShe Belongs to Me\u201d. The cloak and dagger dangles Madams light their candles In ceremonies of the horsemen, even the pawn must hold a grudge Statues made of matchstick crumble into one another My love, she does not bother She knows too much to argue or to judge The latter, while not as good of a poem, still is a great love song, with a few great lines. My personal favorite is this: She wears an Egyptian ring that sparkles before she speaks She\u2019s a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique Later, in 1966 and now married, Dylan wrote probably his best love songs in Blonde on Blonde. It\u2019s just a sequence of massive love songs with the peak sound of his career. I\u2019d say \u201cI Want You\u201d, \u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\u201d (a clear homage to his then wife), \u201cOne of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\u201d and \u201cJust Like a Woman\u201d. Even though it\u2019s a pop song, \u201cI Want You\u201d has great lines, like the opening one: The guilty undertaker sighs The lonesome organ grinder cries The silver saxophones say I should refuse you The cracked bells and the washed-out horns Blow into my face with scorn But it\u2019s not that way, I wasn\u2019t born to lose you And my favorite from those, \u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\u201d, which is an 11-minute epic with perfect instrumental and perfect vocals. The kings of Tyrus with their convict list Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss And you wouldn\u2019t know it would happen like this But who among them really wants just to kiss you? With your childhood flames on your midnight rug And your Spanish manners and your mother\u2019s drugs And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs Who among them do you think could resist you? With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace And your basement clothes and your hollow face Who among them can think he could outguess you? With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns WHo among them would try to impress you? From then on, he continued to write some great love songs, but I think he peaked in this category around this time. Having said that, I still have to mention a few. In 1974, he released Planet Waves and even though the album is kind of childish with a dad-like Dylan, there are two deep love-related songs, the heartbroken \u201cDirge\u201d and \u201cWedding Song\u201d. The latter is again to his then wife, Sara Lownds, and even though it isn\u2019t as poetic as any other of the mentioned before, it\u2019s still powerful for being so personal and so touching. In 1975 The Basement Tapes were out and, with it, \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Going Nowhere\u201d, another good Dylan love song. 1976\u2019s Desire also had a single great love song: \u201cSara\u201d, another personal favorite of mine without such a poetic bless that Dylan\u2019s early love songs used to have. After that, there were more good songs with some theme of love (\u201cLove Sick\u201d, \u201cIs Your Love in Vain?\u201d, etc.) but they weren\u2019t as focused on love or were breakup songs. Or they just weren\u2019t good enough (\u201cMake You Feel My Love\u201d). ",
