            "answer_text": "If you download it legally it will come with all the tags and covers. If you use illegal methods to obtain songs and want all the correct tags and pictures you will have to do it yourself in itunes, google the artwork and cop and paste it into the song/s. If you do not use itunes, there is plenty of programs that find the album, song and artwork for you. Have a google search because there are quite a few, and they all specialise in slightly different things. I use a simple program called Musicbrainz picard if my tags and artwork need adding, but you have to find the artwork by a simple good search. There are programs that do it all for you though, like i said. ",

If you find some other source, you can use Google Images to find pictures of the performers, possibly including the album covers. But shame on you for ripping off performers and composers. ",

Album artwork, can be easily found, and downloaded, by looking up the artist or band's discography on wikipedia. I'd also like to add, there is no bundled software, i.e. malware, spyware, adware., and can also be used to add tags such as, band names, song titles, album, genre, and release year. I trust it to my computers, and have been using it for 4 years now. ",
