            "answer_text": "It was a smart business move on his part. After some of his shady business came to light (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the full extent of it), the stocks of YG plummeted. Had he stayed that would have meant the complete downfall of YG. He is still the major shareholder of the YG Entertainment. According to the MarketScreener[1] Yang Hyun Suk owns 17.3% in common stock, his brother owns 3.56%. Therefore, he will more than likely continue to have an indirect or direct influence over the company. Furthermore, the newly appointed CEO of YG, Hwang Bo Kyung, had been working for the company since 2001. I refuse to believe that someone who has worked for the YG for over 18 years had no idea of what sort of shady business he was involved in. There is this term called \u2018Glass Cliff\u2019 phenomenon. It refers to the tendency of groups, organizations, or political parties to put women in power during times of crisis or downturn, when the likelihood of failure is highest. It makes the company look good regardless: if the woman fails, the company still earns a reputation of being \"progressive,\" but it is free to reappoint a man to her position when she fails; if she succeeds, the company is better off and might even take credit for having the foresight to appoint the right person for the job. [2] I might sound very sceptic, but it\u2019s important to remember that Yang Hyun Suk has been in the business for many years. He might be a crappy human being, but he is undoubtedly an experienced businessman.

            "answer_text": "I feel YG & his brother have been involved in some extremely shady business practices over the years. HE\u2019S undoubtedly the one who got Seungri to act as a shill at various clubs. He\u2019s also practiced a lot of favoritism and ignored (left in the basement, as they say) some groups (IKON) which is nasty. His cover-ups of various problems that his idols had show his corruption. Now, I could care LESS about pop stars using drugs, going to prostitutes, having groupie sex, gambling - illegal or not - I\u2019d be a total hypocrite, classic rock fan that I am, if I said differently. But bribing the police and other officials and using these activities to blackmail artists (tell me that didn\u2019t happen somewhat with Seungri, yeah) - THAT is noxious. So I am glad that he\u2019s resigning. I just hope someone takes over who\u2019s got more integrity. I also hope the SK police throw that little drug-dealer publicity hound in jail instead of going after celebrity users from years ago just for fame - it makes me sick. ",
