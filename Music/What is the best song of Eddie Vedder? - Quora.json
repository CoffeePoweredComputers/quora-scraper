            "answer_text": "I have been a silent Quora spectator for a while now. :)So, here is my 2 cents: I loved all the songs from Eddie Vedder, but these following couple of songs have a special place: 1. \"Guaranteed\" On bended knee is no way to be freeLifting up an empty cup, I ask silentlyThat all my destinations will accept the one that's meSo I can breathe Circles they grow and they swallow people wholeHalf their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never knowGot a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soulAnd so it goes Don't come closer or I'll have to goOwning me like gravity are places that pullIf ever there was someone to keep me at homeIt would be you Everyone I come across in cages they boughtThey think of me and my wandering but I'm never what they thoughtGot my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughtsI'm alive Wind in my hair I feel part of everywhereUnderneath my being is a road that disappearedLate at night I hear the trees they're singing with the deadOverhead Leave it to me as I find a way to be Consider me a satellite forever orbitingI know all the rules but the rules did not know meGuaranteed (Close your eyes for the last minute humming, you will be taken to a different world.) 2. Society  It's a mystery to meWe have a greed with which we have agreedAnd you think you have to want more than you needUntil you have it all, you won't be free Society, you're a crazy breedI hope you're not lonely without me When you want more than you have, you think you needAnd when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleedI think I need to find a bigger placeCause when you have more than you think, you need more space Society, you're a crazy breedI hope you're not lonely without meSociety, crazy indeedHope you're not lonely without me There's those thinking more or less, less is moreBut if less is more, how you Means for every Kinda like you're startin' from the topAnd you can't do that Society, you're a crazy breedI hope you're not lonely without meSociety, crazy indeedI hope you're not lonely without me Society, have mercy on meI hope you're not angry if I disagreeSociety, you're crazy indeedI hope you're not lonely without me P.S. It took me 21 hours just to get the guitar chords right. Totally worth it. ",
