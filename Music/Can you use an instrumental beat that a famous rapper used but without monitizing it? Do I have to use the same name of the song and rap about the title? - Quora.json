In fact, many well known rappers record tracks over other artist\u2019s beats and release them to dj\u2019s as exclusive \u201cfreestyles\u201d. As an unknown artist though, you may get flagged by youtube if you upload tracks using well known instrumentals. It's what happened to me. You can check out a couple of my tracks below where I did this. The first one is live, where I used the beat to \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d by Immortal Technique. The second one is the one that kept getting flagged, I spit over \u201crun this town\u201d by Jay-Z.

If you for instance put it up on SoundCloud or YouTube you have made it available to the public and it makes you open to a copyright lawsuit. Using the same title can actually make it worse as then you also open yourself up for a lawsuit over trying to hitch a ride on someone else\u2019s reputation.  Don\u2019t be a copy. From a copyright standpoint you can\u2019t base your work on someone else\u2019s work without getting a permission (licence) to do so.
