            "answer_text": "Its not just BTS, its anyone who performs music isn't holding concerts at this time because of covid19. BTS has done online concerts last month called bangbang con and a dear class of 2020 for YouTube. They also did their bts festa muster this yr w/o army. This is the new norm until we can safely go to live concerts. It is stressful knowing no live concerts will be held this yr. I have 2 tickets for bts concerts in nj and md that were postponed and i hope to use next yr. Just keep informed online when bts will have their next online concert. In the meantime just look up old concerts. I joined in 2017 and love watching their early music concert videos on YouTube. ",
