            "answer_text": "This is a really good question. With a little care, you can craft a new piece of music that sounds as if it were actually from the renaissance period.Since this request seems to be for music that will be \"background\" music for your fantasy, the final result should most likely be instrumental. One of the most common instruments of the renaissance was the lute. Those that could play it well were the 15th and 16th century equivalent of rock stars. A few notable names (not all inclusive by any means) would be Anthony Holborne, Francis Cutting, Robert Johnson, Thomas Robinson, and the one at the top of most lists, John Dowland. If you can write music to imitate lute music of this era, then you will have hit pay dirt.  Often times, lute music is a straight-forward \"melody and accompaniment\" approach. The melody is presented in the upper voice, while the supporting harmony (usually just two or three notes including the bass) support in a somewhat chordal style. When the melody seems to sustain on a single pitch, the other voices will often have some type of counterpoint. This counterpoint need not to be consistent nor constant to be effective. Remember, one of the hallmarks of renaissance music, even in secular settings, was restraint. When the texture is just two voices, they are almost always rhythmically different. Your last question concerned modes.  Since the renaissance is not part of the Common Practice Period (1600-1900), it's music to our 21st century ears can certainly take some surprising harmonic turns. This is largely due to the choice of chords. A quick analysis of a few Ren. pieces quickly shows that these \"surprise\" chords in and of themselves are rarely dissonant. On the contrary, they are usually major (and less often minor) triads. So the trick of how to make something new sound like renaissance? Avoid the guidelines that give us tonal music! Here is what I mean. 1. Keep harmonies simple. Most renaissance pieces didn't uses anything beyond triads in the harmonies. 7ths on V chords are ok, but there were actually sparse too. 2. Avoid using chromatic or secondary harmonies. Secondary dominants and the like didn't really become fashionable until on into the Baroque, so these will only detract from what you are trying to accomplish.3.Keep the forms simple. Symmetric (or nearly so) phrases that were repeated were often the formula of the day. A performance practice by lutenists was to play a phrase \"straight\" the first time and to add ornamentation on the repeat.4. In major mode pieces, it is ok to use a major triad built on a lowered 7th scale degree. EX: In G this would produce an F major triad. This isn't the same as mixolydian mode, because in most cases, the composer would have used the diatonic 7th for either melody and or harmony before or after this lowered 7th. These tips may not make you sound exactly like John Dowland, but they will get you started! Let me know how it turns out. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm puzzled by your question. If you have heard a representative sampling of the music it should be clear how to imitate it adequately. (Many many years ago I did a full 90 minute score for an NPR radio drama under similar constraints - it isn't hard.) The better your hearing skills, the more accurate you'll be.  If your imaginary troubador is not attached to some sort of feudal court you can just give yourself a diatonic tuned harp/zither/lute or early guitar relative, or something with a simple drone as the accompaniment.
