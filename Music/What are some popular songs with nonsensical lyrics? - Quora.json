However, play it to a bunch of drunken brits over 30 and they\u2019ll all join in. Slip inside the eye of your mindDon't you know you might findA better place to playYou said that you'd never beenBut all the things that you've seenWill slowly fade away So I start a revolution from my bed'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head.Step outside, summertime's in bloomStand up beside the fireplaceTake that look from off your faceYou ain't ever gonna burn my heart out And so Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on byHer soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say Take me to the place where you goWhere nobody knows if it's night or dayBut please don't put your life in the handsOf a Rock n Roll bandWho'll throw it all away I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed'Cause you said the brains I had went to my headStep outside 'cause summertime's in bloomStand up beside the fireplaceTake that look from off your face'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on byMy soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on byHer soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can waitShe knows it's too late as she's walking on byMy soul slides awayBut don't look back in angerDon't look back in angerI heard you say At least not today https://genius.com/Oasis-dont-look-back-in-anger-lyrics ",
