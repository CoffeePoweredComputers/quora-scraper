            "answer_text": "He was sick of it\u2026. So he faked a motor cycle accident, got a Doctor to testify that medical reasons meant he didn't have to tour, and took the next few years off the road\u2026. He retreated into rural rusticity, helped make \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d with The Band, moved into country with \u201cJohn Wesley Harding\" and Nashville Skyline\", and generally continued to re-write the rules until he was good and ready to go back to playing live\u2026. In the eight years that Dylan was off the road he was hardly inactive - he made a surprise appearance at the 1971 concert for Bangladesh, featured in Peckinpah\"s \u201cPat Garrett and Billy the Kid\", but in 1974 he went back on the road with The Band\u2026 Since 1988 Dylan has, as well as writing and recording some of the finest material of his career, been in what has become known as The Never Ending Tour\u2026..

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I think Dylan still tours. \u201966 was a rough year for him because he went electric. Those pesky Beatles, eh? But that\u2019s not why he did it. He did it because he wanted to explore that sound. But I had a friend who saw Dylan in 66 and the crowd was booing and yelling \u201cTwist for me Dylan.\u201d But he never stopped and never looked back. I have seen him 4 times, and the first time was like 1988, so he was still touring. ",
