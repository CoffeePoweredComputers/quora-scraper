            "answer_text": "Stray Kids. Yes, I\u2019m a big fan of them, but this is also coming from a non-biased point of view. Stray Kids has songs about overcoming hardships, going at things at your pace, and ignoring the voices in your head. They are the group to listen to when you\u2019re feeling down and you can\u2019t get up. Some good songs to listen to (and to read the translated lyrics) are: VoicesMy PaceSide EffectsLevanter (English vers. and the original song)Double Knot (English vers. and the original)The members are very supportive, and they wish to help their fans through music. I hope you give them a listen! ",
