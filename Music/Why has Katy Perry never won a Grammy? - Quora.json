            "answer_text": "I'm actually not sure. Theoretically, she is the top ranked female artist, tying with Michael Jackson to the amount of number one singles/albums. I think it's weird that she hasn't won a Grammy yet because she's been nominated so many times and everything she's been nominated for has been a brilliant song/video. Taylor Swift is on the most achieved list also, but is behind Katy. (Not right after, a few places after) yet she has one a few Grammys herself. This is odd to me, the two are both fantastic singers and songwriters and are both talented. It also confuses me that Katy has the most followers on twitter (and got a new record of the first to 60mil, first to 70mil) yet she probably isn't on the top ten for instagram. I know that Katy's time will come to win a Grammy, but if she doesn't in the next few years when she is career-active, it will remain a mystery to most of us. ",
