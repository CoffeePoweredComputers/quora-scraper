            "answer_text": "The first ones that come to mind are \u201cDreamHigh\u201d and \u201cDream High 2\u201d   I love the cast and there are some great scenes in \u201cDream High\u201d but it isn\u2019t the deepest series, nor is the OST the most incredible I have heard. It is similar to \u201cFame\u201d in that it is about kids attending a music school. The biggest trials are trying to compete in the music industry and love triangles. It isn\u2019t the best drama I have seen, but I think it is still worth watching. Bae Suzy and Taecyeon are in this one, too.  The sequel is not even a quarter as addictive or interesting as the first, although it should be. Whereas most films feature the performers, it is rare that we get to examine the people who compose it and/or write the lyrics. We are also meant to examine other genres like rock. Although it has some fantastic ideas, the script and plot is lacking- other than all of the parts with Hyorin/Hyolyn in it. If you haven\u2019t listened to SISTAR or any of Hyolyn\u2019s music, check it out. Her vocals are incredibly beautiful and husky. Ailee is also featured here, too. \u201cDream High\u201d and \u201cDream High 2\u201d are meant to be romcom/inspiring dramas. My personal favourite is the film \u201cHighway Star\u201d  It is an older comedy/drama about a singer from a metal band that tries out for the \u201cTrot\u201d genre. Think karaoke synthesized-style music, sequined tuxes, slow music with lots of vibrato.  He is so ashamed, he hides behind a luchador mask when he competes for the part, and so it begins. For Japanese dramas, I have watched \u201cNodame Cantabile\u201d which I would NOT recommend. The music is incredible, but the drama is awful- a lot of over the top comedy with a wailing heroine, a perverted conductor and an arrogant love interest that punches her. A lot of beautiful classical music though, and a glimpse into the life of trying to get into the orchestra. The best film though is \u201cLinda, Linda, Linda\u201d   It is a slow-paced, Japanese film about a group of girls performing a song for their school\u2019s talent show. It is a slice-of-life film that is more about the every-day memories of high school, but the band it covers is phenomenal - The Blue Hearts.  That is it for the ones I have watched, but I found this: 7 Inspirational Characters From K-Dramas About The Music Industry (A list from Soompi) as well as a list from Spinditty: 13 Best Korean Musical Dramas That You Must Watch It mentions \u201cMonstar\u201d which a lot of Kdrama fans have recommended, but I haven\u2019t watched yet. Good luck and happy viewing! ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest I haven\u2019t come acroos many dramas that showed the music genre, but here area few. Dream High  Thia is such a classic drama that I think all kdrama fans should watch in general, not just because it\u2019s music themed. It\u2019s set in an arts school that trains students in various things like singing or dancing so they can become the stars of the entertainment world. This drama shows the hardships of the students, the romance between them and how they all mature through out it. Moreover, the teachers at the school are heavily involved making it even more interesting. You\u2019re beautiful  This series is all about a band who has gets an additional member but what they don\u2019t know the member\u2019s twin sister is posing as him. It\u2019s hystrical to see band members confusion when they start developing weird feelings to her and start to question heir sexuality!! Honestly, I\u2019m sure anyone will love this drama. Cheer up!  Not going to lie this one is not really focused on music and is really more about dance but since dance and music are somewhat similar topics I thought it\u2019d make a great addiotion to the list, especially since it\u2019s phenomenal. This drama shows the story of how the students at a school are discriminated against based on their status and grades. Even though it\u2019s such a heavy topic, the series gives the message in a light and cheerful way which is why I recommend it 100%. ",

HeartstringsI love it. 2. My lovely girl It has rain (the singer ;)) in this. The plot is kind of sad and slightly twisted, but the drama is nonetheless great. 3. Nodame cantabile (Japanese) Apparently, there is a Korean remake to this drama called *cantabile tomorrow* but i\u2019d still suggest one to watch the Japanese version. It\u2019s literally the perfect adaptation of manga, including all the of extremely dramatic and over-expressive comic panels. 4. Dream High 1 & 2 There is a sequel to this drama, the first one should have been definitely amazing. You can blindly go by that principle, when dramas have sequels. :p 5. The liar and his lover My favorite. 6. You are beautiful 7. Top Management 8. Shut up flower boy band 9. Entertainer 10. Mary stayed out all night 11. Producers & High end crush (Short/Web drama) They slightly fall under this category too, i suppose.
