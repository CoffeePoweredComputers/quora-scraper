            "answer_text": "Some people think so, some people don't, why does it really matter at the end of the day if they were? Except for the fact it would have been a living hell for them in that time period. They could have been arrested and would have had to hide their love away. Yoko hinted that John was probably in love with Paul but that Paul was too heterosexual for anything to happen between them. She also said she considered him to be her biggest rival, not Cynthia. What we do know is that John Lennon and Paul McCartney were soulmates, heterosexual lifemates if you will. They had a bond so deep and so unique it's quite impossible to define. I don't think there was ever another friendship like it and most probably never will be again. They were mirror images, two sides of the same coin, if they were more only Sir Paul can really tell us. George Harrison had said that whenever they were in the same room their eyes would lock into one another and then everyone else but them seemed to cease to exist. As far back as the Quarrymen bandmates remarked how John and Paul would communicate without words and if someone dared to contradict one of them, they'd exchange a look and sooner or later that person found themselves no longer in the band. So were they lovers? I don't know, it wouldn't bother me one iota if we discovered tomorrow they were except to have an innate sadness of the pain it must have caused in 1960's society to hide their feelings always worrying about someone catching on. But would I care that they were lovers, nope, not even if I had found out in the 60's. I am open minded I wouldn't have minded sharing Macca with Johnny boy for a single second, in fact it might just have been fun\u2026\u2026..hey\u2026\u2026 Just saying And you know what? They would have been a damned good looking couple and at the end of the day it doesn't matter, would you stop listening to their music, maybe see new meanings in more of their lyrics, have an epiphany about the breakup? They are still Lennon/McCartney the greatest songwriting team to have ever been and their band The Beatles are still the greatest band in history.    ******EDIT****** Just an additional thought for a moment. There are far more \u201cclues or evidence \u201c that they were intimately involved than there are for all of those idiotic PID conspiracy theories BTW. The looks and touches in videos and photographs make a much more persuasive case for a relationship than any clues on album covers or in the albums themselves. That's all folks\u2026..again, just saying ;p ",

            "answer_text": "There is no evidence that there were unresolved sexual feelings between Lennon and McCartney. After Albert Goldman wrote that horrible smear job \u201cThe Lives of John Lennon\u201d, I watched an interview with Paul McCartney and he was commenting on the book saying it was a pack of vicious and he quipped, \u201cHe [Lennon] never hit on ME, darling.\u201d It is clear that there was a lot of affection between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, between all four of The Beatles really, that they were close friends who loved each other. But this was also a working relationship and a rivalry too. George Martin described it as \u201ca healthy competition\u201d between the two. After Lennon\u2019s famous \u201choliday\u201d with Brian Epstein McCartney stated fairly recently that he believed that Lennon only went away with Epstein as a means to influence Epstein, as McCartney put it, \u201cJohn wanted Brian to know who Mr. Epstein should be listening to\u201d, as far as the band\u2019s creative direction. So, they friends, collaborators but also competing for control over the band (like all creative collaborators). John Lennon very candidly described his relationship with Brian Epstein as \u201can intense love affair that was never consummated\u201d, Ono has gone on record as saying that Lennon told her he liked her so much because \u201cyou\u2019re like a bloke\u201d and people have described Lennon as being \u201cambisexual\u201d or willing to experiment. You would think that Lennon and \u201cthe cute Beatle\u201d would have had a dalliance or two, but I do not believe that was the nature of their close and complicated relationship. Paul McCartney may simply be \u201cas straight as an arrow\u201d as some people put it and while he loved Lennon it was a platonic or brotherly sense of love. (Interesting off-topic note. There is the story of McCartney stopping by to visit Lennon after Lennon had moved to New York and the story goes that Lennon \u201ccoldly\u201d told McCartney, \u201cYou can\u2019t just stop by anymore, it\u2019s not like the old days.\u201d Turns out the more accurate version is that Sean had just been born and Lennon\u2019s reaction was actually more along the lines of, \u201cWhat are you thinking?? I\u2019ve got a kid to take care and you drop by without calling first?? This isn\u2019t like the old days Paul!\u201d Lennon was busy, not \u201ccold\u201d. ) ",

            "answer_text": "The only Beatle about whom it has been claimed that he had any kind of romantic/sexual relation with a man is John Lennon. Albert Goldman made various claims in his \u2018biography\u2019, but they\u2019re dubious at best. A far more reliable source is Lennon\u2019s close friend Pete Shotton, who wrote in his absorbing memoir John Lennon In My Life that Lennon had described to him a sexual encounter he\u2019d had with Brian Epstein while they were on holiday together in 1963. According to Shotton, Lennon (who was by his own admission curious about Epstein as a person) offered Epstein sex, and Epstein declined, but Lennon ended up giving him manual stimulation. When Lennon and Epstein returned from holiday and attended McCartney\u2019s birthday party, local DJ and fan Bob Wooler made a joke to him about the holiday, alluding to the idea that Lennon and Epstein might have got together. A very drunk Lennon lost his temper and beat Wooler severely, but apologised the next day. Shotton\u2019s book is the most substantial evidence we have that Lennon ever got intimate with another man. Personally I think it\u2019s plausible, but I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on it. I look forward to the next volume of Mark Lewisohn\u2019s epic Beatles biography, where the evidence will be presented and sifted more thoroughly. Despite McCartney\u2019s image as the softest and prettiest Beatle, all accounts agree that in his Beatles heyday he was rampantly heterosexual. He has preserved a gentlemanly silence about the number of groupies he bedded, except for the wisecrack \u2018It should have been called \u201cCan Buy Me Love\u201d, actually.\u2019 Nobody has ever suggested that Lennon and McCartney were anything more than close (and at times, not-so-close) friends.

            "answer_text": "I'm a Gay man, and a life long Beatles Fan. Absolutely NOT. There is no way ANY of the Beatles were Gay. If the three of them were in Hamburg, McCartney, Lennon and Harrison, and sharing beds, even by my orientation, it was impossible. There sometimes is a window were heterosexuals can do homosexual acts. It doesn't mean they are Homosexual, just part of our experiments in sex as we healthily decide our orientation. John did go away on holiday with Brian Epstein alone, and much has been made of this. John would be sat at a Cafe with Brian Epstein, asking: \u201cdo you fancy this one? (Meaning a walking passed male), Brian saying yes or no. John Lennon had too much time on his hands, and took this holiday to cerment their business relationship. Sexuality has a certain \u201cpower\u201d drive, John liked all such Mind Games, (yes a good name for an Album). Lennon regarded himself as the leader of the Beatles, it was HIS Band, and realised Epstein was Gay. A holiday to cement his power is possible, as homosexuality was still a crime, even though the Law was changed that year of 1967, it still does not fit. Was Epstein going to allow more power to Lennon, quite frankly being in the most famous Band in history, was enough power for any despot. Yes, in New York, Lennon had beaten up a musician who gave Lennon a kiss, which he and Yoko talked about in an interview. So I think it highly unlikely. Yoko has just recently admitted having a Lesbian relationship, with Hilary Clinton, throughout the 70's. So Lennon had every opportunity to admit his sexual nature. Lennon was for all oppressed groups, decades before those groups got recognition, so coming out may have given him more \"street Cred\", but NO, he wasn't Gay, trust me, Lennon was never short of confidence in declaring stuff about himself, but he never did, because he never was Gay.

            "answer_text": "First, I don't care. Second, neither should you. Third, it's 2019. John died 39 years ago. Murdered, if you remember. Fourth, why does it matter? Will you now just hate their music if it turns out either or both were gay? Or in a romantic relationship with each other? If you are THAT shallow? You're not a true fan. What difference does it make if John and Paul had a romantic relationship? None. Why do you care? You should not. What is your point asking this question? I see no valid point. What do you want to achieve? To be able to tell your friends: \u201cSee? I was right?\u201d So? What does that prove? Nothing. If that's your highest life goal, then I am sad for you. Let's say they were romantically involved. Hypothetically. Do you have a problem with that? Why do you care? Does it make them bad people? No. Can't people just love who they love, without it making a damn difference if they are gay or not gay? Why does it matter? Why do you care? Why does anyone care? Biblical rationales aside. It should make no difference what they do in the privacy of their bedroom. Or hotel room. Wherever. We are fans. Not our damn business. Being gay is not wrong. Not a disease you can cure. Being gay is not a choice. It is decided before one is born. It should not matter in 2019. To anyone. Ever. As someone else said: \u201cAnd if they did? So what?\u201d Get over it and move on. It is a non-issue. One day, I hope and pray this sort of question never needs to be asked. By anyone ever because no one will care. Everyone gay will be out of the closet and it will not be news. In my perfect world. No one should care. This should be irrelevant. You love their music? Good. Enjoy it. Stop worrying about who is in love with who and go live your life. Would you want someone judging you negatively in your relationships? I think not. Who is your best male friend? Would you be okay with someone asking this question about your love life? I bet you would not. Are you and your guy friend in a romantic relationship? If you are? So what? Why should we care? So because they are famous, it's okay to not only invade their privacy but defile it as well with a pointless question? Are you homophobic? Most homophobes are deeply closeted gays, from my experience of 58 years on our planet. If you are gay? Cool. But own that, for goodness sake. Stop trying to distract people with silly questions. Come out come out wherever you are. And be good with that. Stop worrying about anyone else's business but your own, at least regarding your sexual orientation. Or theirs. That is your business. No one else's. Same for Paul and John. Not our business. Should not matter. Let it go. Thanks for reading this far. Thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Paul it seems is not gay considering his record of known love affairs - starting with Jane Asher, and his masculinity has never been in question while some doubts can be casted on John because of his closeness to Brian Epstein who was gay. But I think he was not gay. Not a chance. Know why? If he was, considering he was a witty, glib talker who held nothing back, he would have revealed it when he was still alive! Paul and John were great friends, and that was all there was to it.  (If by chance you can secure a copy of the book 'The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon & Yoko Ono\u201d interviews by David Sheff. Playboy Press, 1981 you'd have a better feel of John Lennon. This was the last interview of John Lennon. It appeared as an edited or condensed version in Playboy Magazine December 1980 issue - the exact month he was assassinated. It was only about 20% of the entire series of interviews which was done in several sittings for three weeks in 1980. Due to the demand, a year later, Playboy published the complete interview, 194 pages in all, without editing, warts and all and I was able to buy a copy which to this day remains one of my prized possessions. You can read in the book John blabbering away, holding nothing back after a 5 year hiatus from recordings that he spent as househusband, revealing his inner thoughts, his insecurities as songwriter, as singer, angry for not being mentioned in George's book \u201cI, Me, Mine\" and envious of George for being considered more fashionable, counting lines he contributed to Paul's songs, debating with Yoko, etc. But most importanly his critical assessment of each and every Beatles song. If he was gay, liberal minded that he was, he would have said it then. In fact, considering his personality, if he was, he might have even flaunted it. But he wasn't and there was no mention of it nor hint nor anything remotely connected to it. I have other books about Lennon but this one is really the \u201creference book\" as intended by him.

At one time they planned to someday marry each other and move to Australia and open a discount Fish & Chip shop in Perth. But cruel fate tore the lavender Liverpudlian lovers apart when evil overlord Brian Epstein forced them to choose between true love and a fat pay packet.  But that\u2019s not the whole story of the convoluted secret gay sex lives of the Beatles\u2026. Wednesdays were reserved for Paul & George to play \u201cHand up the horsey\u201d for several hours in the Abbey Road loo, while Pete Best waited outside to scrub up when they\u2019d finished. John and Ringo had a whips and chains thing going, but never never on a Sunday, for they were both good christian boys. In fact, John first met Yoko when she was a penniless nude cashier at Bungalow Bill\u2019s Bondage Goods & Curry Shop on High Street in the spring of \u201857. Cynthia & Maureen were, as everyone knows, cardboard cut-outs and not actual people. The role of Patti Harrison was played by Rex Harrison, and was another of his brilliant performances, for which he won the bronze at the 1982 summer Olympics. George and Ringo met Thursdays at the Victoria & Albert Museum for a light round of anal (with a \u2018touch\u2019 of oral), while Paul and John preferred \u201cfiddling about\u201d with the Albanian midgets at the local Bird & Bee, whilst dressed as medieval harlots in all their gaudy finery. A splendid time was guaranteed for all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brian Epstein was actually a closeted heterosexual, but grudgingly filmed the sessions in Super 8 for the Beatles fan club annual porno reel. He was paid 8 pence per film, which splendidly supplemented his meager allowance from his mum. His mum Queenie, of course, was the real \u201cpower behind the throne,\u201d and boldly beat the band members behinds when they misbehaved, which they all rather enjoyed. Pete Best was usually called in afterwards to clean up the mess, except when he wasn\u2019t, cuz he wasn\u2019t very good at that either. The videos are available on You Tube, except when they aren\u2019t, which is generally always. ",

But tension forced The Beatles bandmates apart \u2014 until they learned that they should just let it be.  It felt like any other summer day in Liverpool, but a chance encounter turned into one of the most notable days in music history: the day John Lennon first met Paul McCartney. On July 6, 1957, St. Peter\u2019s Church in Woolton Village was having a church party, where The Quarrymen \u2014 Lennon\u2019s skiffle band at the time \u2014 played. \u201cApparently, we were on stage playing the Del-Vikings doo-wop number 'Come Go With Me,\u2019 and Paul arrived on his bicycle and saw us playing,\u201d Rod Davis of The Quarrymen recalled to Billboard. \u201cIt was somebody we didn\u2019t know, Paul, who met someone we did know. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. You explain this to people, particularly Americans, and they expect there to be angels hiding behind clouds blowing trumpets. It\u2019s all terribly, terribly a non-event \u2014 except in hindsight.\u201d During the meeting, mutual friend Ivan Vaughan introduced the two \u2014 and McCartney joined the band a few months later. While they eventually changed the direction of their sound to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2014 and their name to The Beatles \u2014 what made their eventually success so sweet was the tight friendship between Lennon and McCartney, the songwriters of the group.

            "answer_text": "No. There is nothing to evidence that McCartney had homosexual tendencies. Lennon, on the other hand, has been more questionable. It has been documented that the reason Brian Epstein (who was a closeted gay) became The Beatles\u2019 manager was because upon seeing them at The Cavern acquired an instant crush on Lennon. It has been said that he (Epstein) pestered Lennon about yielding to his inclinations and that Lennon possibly gave in and experimented with him while they were both on holiday together in Spain (1966). It has also been speculated that Lennon\u2019s insistence on art school buddy Stu Sutcliffe remaining in The Beatles as their bassist (even though he couldn\u2019t play bass guitar) was related to their being best friends, and possibly romantically involved. But as for Lennon being with McCartney, there is nothing to substantiate this claim. ",

            "answer_text": "No evidence at all for that. Yoko Ono has stated that John was at least potentially bi-curious or heteroflexible and his violent reaction to someone suggested he and Brian Epstein were sexually involved would be typical of someone repressing that part of themself. So it's not inconceivable that John may have felt some attraction to Paul, his close friend. But even if so, it seems he kept it well hidden and may not even have been aware of it himself. Paul claims he would surely have sensed it, considering all the years they spent together so intimately, but he's being naive. Successfully repressing low-level same-sex attraction is done by countless people, so much so that we are scarcely aware how common this type of thing really is. And even more likely at the time, when very few fully gay people were out of the closet, much less bisexual or bi-curious people. Who knows, perhaps this was one of the things that gave creative energy to their songwriting. ",

And some think there is a possibility they were lovers though they are not sure. At the same time there is a big amount of fans who detest to think about it. They get furious when they read about it\u2026as if it would be something shameful, as if to see a possibility would be a kind of disrespect to them. It isn\u2019t. And yes, there are signals. They don\u2019t prove anything. But they exist. If it is not true, that\u2019s allright. If it is true, that\u2019s allright just the same. I only think that, in case it was true, and they could never come out, it is terribly sad. A lot of guys can\u2019t come out till today. At that time it was a crime. Now it is not a crime anymore in England. It is not a crime in USA. It is not a crime in Brazil where I live. But it is stil a crime in 72 countries. And homophobia is real and dangerous. Homossexuality is not shameful. To beat and even kill them for this reason is shameful. I was very happy and applauding when I saw the Rainbow Flag in Paul\u2019s concert recently. He may be straight, but he supports the LGBT cause which is wonderful. Thank you, Paul. ",

Went to their childhood homes, Beatles museum, etc. I was told by the tour guide who is basically a Beatles history expert, that someone wised off to John, about his going on vacation with Brian Epstein being a gay affair, and John beat the shit out of the guy. He was about to be sued by the guy and Epstein didn\u2019t want the bad publicity, so he paid the guys attorney quite a lot of money to make sure the news media didn\u2019t find out about it. Supposedly, that was when Epstein told the Beatles that they had to start cleaning up their attitudes and even the clothes they wore. They started wearing suits and ties, and weren\u2019t to let anything get them rattled or display any \u201cuncool\u201d behavior which might screw up their public image. It apparently worked. ",

John continued having affairs, eventually marrying Yoko. Paul settled down to live with Linda the love of his life and never cheated on her. When she died, Paul went on to marry 2 other women, divorcing his 2nd wife. ",

Lennon may well have been been at least curious, and the nature of his vacation trip to Spain with Brian Epstein is open to speculation, although it probably had more to do with power and band politics than anything else. To me, the bottom line is that if Lennon had been romantically or sexually interested in Paul McCartney, or even had sexual interest in men at all, he would have mentioned it. He wasn\u2019t known for keeping much to himself, and was willing to discuss anything with sometimes brutal honesty. He would have spilled the beans if he was into Paul. ",

The most credible account of a fling between John and Brian comes from Peter Brown, who took over as the group\u2019s manager after Brian died. In his 1983 hatchet job \u201cThe Love You Make\u201d, Brown claims John and Brian had sex while on vacation in Barcelona in 1963, and his footnotes have a quote where John is supposed to have admitted to it, that he wanted to see what it was like to have sex with a man. Also, John\u2019s close friend Pete Shotten wrote a book around the same time, claiming John admitted that on that trip he dropped his pants let Brian \u201ctoss him off\u201d. ",

It\u2019s notable, though, that all four were very close, and admired, Brian Epstein, who was their manager, and Epstein was gay\u2026 and likely harbored an unrequited affection for John.

Paul Ma cartney came out and defended John Lennon wen the \u201clives of John Lennon\u201d came out in 1988. he said that John never went near him and he was close with him for 20 years. Even if Epstien was attracted to Lennon, he was married and was open to blackmail Epstien did berate lennon for making homophobic comments in the local press (before they were famous) and I doubt either would be so stupid. Besides it\u2019s no ones business but theirs. Leave it alone. ",

Add to that the fact he was Heavy into cocaine and Alcohol, which would have lowered his inhabitions to close to nothing. Oh yeah John would have came out as Gay just to spite Paul with thee \u201cbad publicity\u201d. Between 69 and 72 Lennon would have claimed they were Nazi\u2019s just to stick it to Paul. ",
