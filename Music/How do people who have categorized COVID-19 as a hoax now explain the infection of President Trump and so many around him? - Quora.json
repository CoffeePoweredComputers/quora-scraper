            "answer_text": "Well, how do senior members of the US Congress claim that serious evidence against Hunter Biden is a Russian Conspiracy? How do the House of Representatives and 90% of the mainstream news media claim that Trump was colluding with the Russians to get elected for three years when there was no evidence, and they all knew it was a (to quote a CNN executive) \u201cnothing burger\u201d? How is it that the Chinese Government and the WHO denied so much about COVID reality during the first six months of the pandemic, and people believed them? How is it that the academic elite in the western world continue to think that socialism is a good thing when there is over a century of evidence against that very stance? The answer is that people making the proclamations have an agenda that truth doesn\u2019t help. To push that agenda, they need to distort, twist, obfuscate, and ignore reality. They then take advantage that the problems facing the world today are very complex and that even experts don\u2019t agree or even comprehend fully the various nuances of the issues. That then allows those with an agenda to push emotions instead of facts while making it sound like facts. They then hit two nerves - the fear nerve and the anti-fear nerve. The fear nerve is hit by \u201cdo X, or you will die/get sick/lose everything/see society destroyed/etc.\u201d The anti-fear nerve is \u201cthey (of course \u201cthey\u201d is never defined) are going to destroy/kill/take everything/hurt your children/etc. so ignore them and listen to me.\u201d Depending on who you listen to, you either believe it is the end of the world or a hoax. Given the amount of conflicting information and difficulty find out \u201ctruth\u201d on COVID and Coronavirus, people are forced to lead with emotions instead of truly informed opinions. At one extreme, you have people thinking that if they even see a person without a mask, everyone will get sick and cough up lungs. At the other extreme, you have people thinking that this is just a bad form of cold or flu and that the Democrats are using it as a means to get Trump out of the White House. Both parties (and many other people) use this disease to push their agendas and reality-be-damned seriously. Both positions are equally irrational, yet I can easily point to \u201creliable\u201d sources floating or pushing such narratives. The reality is in the middle. The reality is that COVID19 has the potential to be very bad. Still, there are many easy actions that people can take to mitigate the severity and the probability of infection. If we could stop the hyperbole on both sides and have calm, rational discussions on real options and mitigation techniques, it would reduce the fear and reduce the denial. Unfortunately, those pushing agendas are having too much fun stirring up the populations, so that will never happen. We are doomed to have fear and hoax mongering for at least a year (until the next big thing comes along that the agenda seekers latch onto). ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to all the answers about the right (which really should be called the wrong), believing COVID is a Democrat hoax, now that 230,000 Americans are dead and the virus is out of control in most states, the denial has now morphed into \u201cTrump did everything possible so it is what it is.\u201d A friend who is a trump supporter has a sister who lost a close friend to COVID this past week. She insists that trump did everything he could, so he\u2019s just not responsible. WTAF? Do these folks not watch anything other than FOX? (Unfortunately, no.) And now, of course, the White House policy is \u201cwe can\u2019t stop it so it just has to run its course.\u201d Holy motherforkin\u2019 shirtballs. They surrendered before they ever put up a fight, and are happy to have hundreds of thousands or millions die. in fact, they want herd immunity. Well, in that case, 60% of Americans need to get it which is about 180 million people, and if only 3% die (lower that the actual average), we lose 5,400,000 people. Oh well. It is what it is. I guess it will be good for the funeral business. (Can you imagine if Obama acted like this or said such things when he was President? The right would be out with a literal lynch mob.) Not to mention, no other country will allow us in, so we\u2019ll become more and more isolated from the global community and virtual prisoners in our country. And the impact on the economy of so much illness and death will be disastrous - much more than we have already seen, which certainly is already horrifying. (At what point do other countries stop all trade with us to prevent contact?) For example, I\u2019m an attorney with the USPS and at this point, with all sorts of safeguards, we\u2019re still down 20% of employees each day, much of that due to COVID and related matters. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be for us and all other businesses if the numbers run amok. Oh, wait. We\u2019re going to find out because the numbers are running amok right now. 75,064 cases reported last Thursday (10/22/2020), the highest one-day total since July, and 481,000 new cases in the past week!!! It took us months to get to the first million, now just one week for half a million. It\u2019s growing exponentially. See, e.g., Coronavirus cases break records as states in every part of U.S. reel under the surge; Coronavirus Maps: How Severe Is Your State's Outbreak?; Here Are the States Where COVID-19 Is Increasing. For goodness sakes, make sure to VOTE FOR BIDEN!!! Your lives literally depend on it. ",
