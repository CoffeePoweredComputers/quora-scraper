            "answer_text": "It is about the Seoul ferry accident. I will explain it in a few words: Highschool kids were going on a fieldtrip. It was basically an accident that happened in South Korea a few years ago. A ferry was sinking. The captain of the ship and crew members evacuated but told the students to stay put. There were a lot of high school children who were scared. Basically the situation was handled very poorly. The president told people with cameras to get there to record everything that was happening. That was her prioriy. Instead of insuring the kids\u2019 safety. A lot of children drowned. It was a horrible accident. Many people lost their loved ones and it was extremely tragic. The media didn't take care of the situation properly and was highly criticised for it. There are a few hints in the spring day mv: The abandoned suitcases and clothes represent the children who went with their belonging and things but left(passed away) and didn't come back. Snowpiercer is a movie that describes the difference in the way the upper class and lower class are treated. The lower class are treated poorly and are told to follow the orders that they are given no matter what. One person finally decides to seek justice. Since Rm sang this lyric he says that he wants to do the same thing. Confront the government for handling the situation poorly and for keeping the truth. All the bts members are seen as \u201csurvivors\u201d of the accident in the MV. The survivors do feel guilty and empty that their friends are gone but they are still alive. But they have gone to a better place. Spring day is a very meaningful MV. Don't forget the people and friends that you lost that day. Keep on fighting for justice. The dead will not come back but cherish the memories that you had. As long as they live on in her heart they are always by your side.The lyrics are also very meaningful: I miss youWhen I say that, I miss you moreI\u2019m looking at your photoBut I still miss youTime is so cruelI hate usNow it\u2019s hard to even see each other\u2019s faces It\u2019s only winter hereEven in August, winter is hereMy heart makes time runLike a Snowpiercer left aloneI wanna hold your handAnd go to the other side of the earthTo end this winterHow much longing has to fall like snowFor the spring days to come?Friend Like a small pieceOf dustThat floats in the airIf the flying snow is meI couldReach you faster Snowflakes are fallingGetting farther awayI miss you (I miss you)I miss you (I miss you)How much more do I have to wait?How many more nights do I have to stay up?Until I can see you? (until I can see you?)Until I can meet you? (until I can meet you?) Past the end of this cold winterUntil the spring comes againUntil the flowers bloom againStay there a little longerStay there Did you change?(Did you change?)Or did I change?(Did I change?)I hate even this moment that is passingI guess we changedI guess that\u2019s how everything is Yeah I hate youAlthough you leftThere hasn\u2019t been a day that I have forgotten youHonestly, I miss youBut now I\u2019ll erase youBecause that will hurt less than resenting you I\u2019m blowing out the cold youLike smoke, like white smokeI say that I\u2019m gonna erase youBut actually, I still can\u2019t let you go Snowflakes are fallingGetting farther awayI miss you (I miss you)I miss you (I miss you)How much more do I have to wait?How many more nights do I have to stay up?Until I can see you?

            "answer_text": "Following a frigid winter of teen angst and uncertainty, spring comes as a new beginning; the landscape begins to fill with new life, and new stories begin. And in true BTS fashion, they\u2019ve managed to pull out some obscure literary references to tie into the plot of \u201cSpring Day.\u201d The most notable of which is the inclusion of the Omelas Hotel, in reference to the short story by Ursula K. Le Guin, \u201cThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.\u201d As DreamTeller theorized, the city of Omelas \u2014 as well as the hotel room in the MV \u2014 stand as a false utopia: a place where everyone is perpetually happy and carefree, but under the surface, one child must suffer in order to maintain the balance. In the story, some residents choose to walk away from the false paradise to face a new world of uncertainty head on: in the MV we watch BTS finally choose to leave their youth behind and move forward into the future by boarding the train to spring. The Omelas hotel room is the center of the member\u2019s nostalgia, the false utopia they have trapped themselves within in order to preserve the bliss of youth forever. But much like the sparkler and match they hold to the impending darkness, even the brightest of moments eventually burn out.  The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Serieshas centered around the journey into adulthood, with each member facing their own fears and insecurities along the way. Surprisingly, it is the youngest member, Jungkook who chooses to board the train away from Omelas first. He\u2019s always been the one most reluctant to mature, most afraid of what the future holds. Yet, he is the one who first sees the need to move away from his youth. He is soon followed by Rap Monster, who walks through the cars of the train before returning to the Omelas hotel. In a way he is returning to round up the rest of the members, but his return also shows the struggle between moving forward and lingering in the past. Ultimately though, it is Jungkook who runs back to Omelas to gather the members before boarding the train a second time. The rest of the members take their own path to boarding the train, each bringing their own baggage with them. Sugaliterally has a mountain of laundry and memories that he rests atop of while he tries to sort out all the change in his life, trying not to be resentful of the person who left him. Did you change?Or did I change?I hate even this moment that is passingI guess we changedI guess that\u2019s how everything is Throughout the series, we\u2019ve watched Jin routinely take snapshots of his memories, and this is a theme continued in \u201cSpring Day.\u201d Jin wants to keep bits of his youth forever, to keep things unchanging like a photograph even as the world spins on around him. In \u201cSpring Day\u201d Jin takes snapshots with his fingers \u2014 holding his hands up in front of him to watch his fellow members advance along the staircase of life. It isn\u2019t until they\u2019re all on the train together than he finally puts his fingers down, when he finally moves past trying to preserve his youth \u2014 their togetherness \u2014 forever, and moves towards growing up. I miss youWhen I say thatI miss you moreI\u2019m looking at your photoBut I still miss you V and J-Hope both take a unique route to boarding the train. In the case of V, he\u2019s always been the most wayward among the group \u2014 teetering on the edge of death, particularly through suicidal imagery. Somehow though, in each MV, he always pulls himself back and continues to trudge on. In \u201cSpring Day\u201d it seems he\u2019s finally come to terms with his own demons as he waits patiently for the train. He even walks alone on the tracks to catch up to it before boarding with a smile on his face. J-Hope, on the other hand, is seen riding atop the train with a paper airplane \u2014 combating his fear of heights and finally being free.  Jimin has the most interesting sub-plot, as he clings to the memory of those being left behind by carrying around a pair of worn sneakers. The shoes hint at death \u2014 at the memories Jimin is carrying around in his conscious \u2014 and his own grief and guilt for trying to move on without someone. He sits with the sneakers at the beach and atop a spinning washing machine, still unable to fully abandon the memories of those in his past. Even once he\u2019s seated on the train, Jimin is inconsolable, shrugging away J-Hope\u2019s comforting hand to his knee. Out of all the members, he\u2019s the least ready to move on. There is no such thing as eternal happiness, there is no real Omelas like everyone hopes for. Even the fictional utopia of Omelas had its darkness in the single child to who had to suffer for everyone\u2019s happiness. Once the members have finally accepted that eternal youth is not eternal happiness, they are able to board the train together, to push forward into the unknown. There may be an unforgiving winter ahead, but once they pass through the tunnel, spring will come; and they will still be together. Cherry blossoms are bloomingThe winter is endingI miss youI miss you When they get off the train in spring, Jimin finally releases the sneakers he\u2019s been toting by placing the shoes in a tree; preserving the memory of youth forever, but allowing himself to grow away from it. In so doing, he honors the loss of youth \u2014 or potentially the Sewol victims \u2014 and those who didn\u2019t manage to make it into adulthood. Cherry blossoms begin to swirl around the members, and they can all finally find some form of peace in one another.  What makes the MV for \u201cSpring Day\u201d so touching, is that it\u2019s not all hopeful. There\u2019s sadness, reluctance, and longing as the members begin to move forward, away from the familiar and on to something new. \u201cSpring Day\u201d is all about loss, about missing someone, about clinging to youth. But most importantly, it\u2019s about carrying on. The memories of the past will always be there, and we can chase them forever and end up in a hopeless cycle \u2014 like the washing machine featured \u2014 if we so choose. Or, we can mourn in our own way, move on, and truly live. Past the end of this cold winterUntil the spring comes againUntil the flowers bloom againStay there a little longerStay there The song doesn\u2019t really hit the mark for me \u2014 as most songs that include the Millennial Whoop do not \u2014 but the MV for \u201cSpring Day\u201d does. Loss is complex, growing up is never easy, and BTS manage to visualize that struggle through each member\u2019s individual storyline. They captured the utopian highs of youth and happiness, the inexplicable pain of loss, and the will to carry on and live even when you\u2019re hurting. There are a lot of ways to interpret this MV based on your own personal experiences, which make it an especially poignant release. For some, the MV will be about friendship, for others it will be about the loss of a loved one, and for many young Koreans it may tie back to the Sewol tragedy which defined their youth. For twenty-somethings like me, \u201cSpring Day\u201d is a reflection of the terrifying cusp of adulthood, where we cling to the nostalgia of youth as adulthood slowly pulls us further and further away. No two people will have the same reading of this MV, but nearly everyone will be touched and moved in a personal way. I hope it helped :) ",
