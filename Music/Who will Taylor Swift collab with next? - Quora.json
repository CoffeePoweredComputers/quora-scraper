            "answer_text": "Christian singer, Lauren Daigle could but, idk if she would. I like some ts but, don\u2019t listen to any country other than ts in years. Likely someone much younger, unknown. Few have a mother that would pour so much of her life into her young daughter's career. Without Taylor Swift\u2019s love for God shown to her daughter, there would be no ts. She would likely be a saleswoman at a bank that did local singer or poem readings in pa instead, through caring and persistence ts has developed into the greatest singer of her generation. She has even managed to keep my attention through her emotional expression alone. A feat never before experienced.  ",
