            "answer_text": "I would err on the side of Yamaha, simply because they\u2019ve been sampling their concert grands For use in their keyboards, for years. Or maybe you don\u2019t want the over metallic sound that Yamaha have become known for. It also depends on what you\u2019re amplifying with. Yamaha have been doing what they\u2019ve been doing for a long time, when Casio were making watches and calculators .. does that make them better, or use a little hacknied ? ",
