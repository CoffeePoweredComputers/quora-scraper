            "answer_text": "There are at least 2 times that I know of that someone besides Charlie Watts played drums on a Rolling Stones track. Jimmy Miller played the drums on \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d according to the liner notes of Let It Bleed. On the Dirty Work album, Ron Wood played drums on \u201cSleep Tonight\u201d. According to Mick Jagger, due to Charlie\u2019s problems with heroin and alcohol in the mid 80\u2019s, he didn\u2019t play a lot on Dirty Work. It would appear that at least some of the drum work on that album was by Steve Jordan and Anton Fig. Watts\u2019 state at the time was one of the reasons that Jagger says he didn\u2019t want to tour the album and decided to record Primitive Cool instead.
