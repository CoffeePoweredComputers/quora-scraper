            "answer_text": "Personally, I use the Alternate Mode Trap Kat for edrums. I\u2019m not familiar with Alesis kits. That said, I\u2019d get the Aerodrums system. Totally silent, for obvious reasons. Even though you are playing air drums, your brain interprets sound in interesting tactile ways. You \u2018feel\u2019 something, even though nothing is there. Except for mesh head edrums, any other \u201cpad\u201d system is going to create sound, especially can that be the case with your kick drum trigger if the surface is sits on is not rug or carpet. That sound, just monotone strikes on rubber, can drive people crazy. Check out the Aerodrums. They\u2019re pretty cool. ",

            "answer_text": "Most inexpensive electric kits will be comparable. If there is a certain feature you're looking for, look out for it. I might suggest finding a used set where you may be able to up the quality for the same dollar. Musical instruments have a low resale value because the market gets flooded with great gear due to lack of interest, lack of space, immediate need for cash etc. ",
