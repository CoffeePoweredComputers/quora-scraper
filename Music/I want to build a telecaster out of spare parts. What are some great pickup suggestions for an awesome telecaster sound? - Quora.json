            "answer_text": "There are many and I certainly haven\u2019t tried them all. Seymour Duncan makes a great variety of pickups that generally tend to favor rock and Metal sounds. Their Web site has descriptions and sound clips for you to compare. Duncan pickups (US made if you care) also aren\u2019t just very high end, expensive boutique models. You might also look at Lace. They made the original high end alternative pickups for Strats and have a decent variety now. Lace at least used to tend toward more classic/vintage sounds, but they\u2019ve branched out. Of course there\u2019s always Fender \u2026 they have some decent options if you\u2019re looking for an authentic rather than alternative sound. I used a Fender Vintage 50s pickup in my P-bass because I was going for that old school sound. Several others came close but they tended to have higher output than Fender. That might be want you want except that as a Jazz player, I wasn\u2019t looking for output that I could overdrive, etc. So that leads to deciding on the sound you\u2019re going for before buying anything. Each maker will indicate what sound their pickup sets aim for. Sound clips on line are great but subject to the limitations of your computer\u2019s sound system. On mine, that\u2019s pretty limited. I more have to go by the target sound and by the reputation of the maker. That doesn\u2019t mean good or bad, but other artists who use their pickups and what they sound like. ",

            "answer_text": "Pete Biltoft with Vintage Vibe Guitars builds the best Tele pickups\u2026.coupled with his 5-way switch, they\u2019re the best I\u2019ve heard\u2026. I asked him to build me a set with the same specs as a friend\u2019s \u201853 Tele which were the best I\u2019d ever heard\u2026.what he built for me are better! And best of all they\u2019re reasonably priced! I would also recommend Warmoth for your body (I went with Tobacco sunburst) roasted maple neck (needs no finish and is smooth as butter)a Callaham bridge and Hipshot locking tuners. It\u2019s my favorite Tele ever! ",
