            "answer_text": "The prevailing opinion is that Ringo was the perfect drummer..for The Beatles. So yes, he was a very good drummer, the PERFECT drummer ..for what The Beatles needed. He was not a gifted rock and roll drummer when you compare him to slightly later guys like Keith Moon, Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice or even Mitch Mitchell;consummate rock drummers whereas Ringo was really a pop drummer. He wasn\u2019t showey, creative, pretentious or even remotely technical on the drum kit. He didn\u2019t do solos all that much (his solo on the Abbey Road Medley is one of my favorites; heavy, precise..conservative), he made few if any mistakes. Fills and rolls were his forte from a purely percussive standpoint. The better comparison would be Charlie Watts (though Ringo\u2019s skiffle background to the latter\u2019s true jazz style would be a notable difference, otherwise very similar in the successful musical role they filled for their respective legendary bands.) Ringo is not seen as a \u201cdrummer\u2019s drummer\u201d in the annals of classic rock. You would think the drummer in the most influential rock and roll band that ever was and ever will be would not be underrated. But he is. Or is he? Ringo\u2019s incalculable (and irreplaceable) value to The Beatles lied not with technique and stylistic innovation but with his dissemination of the musical ideas handed down to him by the other three Beatles during the writing process and in the studio. No other drummer in the world, however more talented they were ability wise, could interpret what John, Paul and George needed into percussive form like Ringo could. He was all about the beats. He put the \u2018Beat\u2019 in The Beatles. His focus on the kit was always tailored to the band\u2019s songwriting in all the various directions they decided to take in many various different songs. Nothing more, nothing less. One of my favorite songs off The White Album (a record I thought Ringo\u2019s drumming particularly stood out in) is Cry Baby Cry. Starr\u2019s hits on that crash and on the snare are so infectious that it\u2019s what\u2019s makes that song so great. Ditto Helter Skelter..the extreme dissonance of his drumming on that number still mesmerizes after first hearing all those years ago as a young kid. Raw and primal. The other day I was listening to The Beatles Channel on Sirius. I think his solo hit Back Off Boogaloo was playing when I thought to myself \u201cWhat the hell? Why is most of Ringo\u2019s solo material composed of such schmaltzy, inconsequential crap?! It doesn\u2019t sound like he is even drumming anymore.\u201d * And then I realized it\u2019s because The Beatles were no more. Ringo\u2019s best and most important work was with The Fab Four. No one else but the other three Beatles-together as a band- could utilize his skill set as a musical composer of percussion. And vice versa. He was utmost integral for Beatles songs. Had he decided to stay quit after the tumultuous White Album sessions, that probably should have been the end of the entire band altogether too. Ringo was not a great drummer of classic rock taken as a whole but probably one of the most important to songwriting. *Despite my utter disdain for Ringo Starr\u2019s solo discography, I think It Don\u2019t Come Easy is one of the better solo Beatle singles released (albeit one that George Harrison had a heavy hand in its quality and success). A few tracks off his 2017 album were also surprisingly good. ",

            "answer_text": "The drummers in this blog have it right. The issue isn\u2019t technicality it\u2019s creativity and influence. He is a completely self taught player. Ringo is incredibly influential to drumming and comparisons about whether he was better then John Bonham or Ginger Baker are about as relevant as asking who was a better singer, Elvis , John Lennon or Paul McCartney or Bruce Springsteen. Really a somewhat ridiculous question. But if you must\u2026if Bonham or Baker or someone else had been the drummer for the Beatles it would not have been the Beatles as we know them. From a drummer\u2019s perspective, I\u2019ve been playing for 55 years, Ringo was revolutionary. Here\u2019s why - he played inside and he was the first rock and roll drummer to play inside. That means he played inside the song fitting the rhythm precisely to the whole scope of a song in the same way a symphonic percussionist plays inside the orchestra. As opposed to playing outside as a lead instrument with fills and movement that sits on top of the music track not inside it. Charlie Watts was also an inside drummer and it\u2019s easy to understand the enormity of what Charlie did for the Stones. But Ringo preceeded Charlie and his creativity was wider then Charlie. Ringo was not \u201cBusy\u201d he was uncluttered. Busy was the way Ginger Baker played, the way Neil plays with Rush, the way Mitch Mitchell played for Hendrix. Nothing wrong just a different place to play. It took me awhile to actually catch up and understand Ringo. Bonham would have dominated Beatle songs rather than added or supported them. Steve Gadd in my mind is a perfect example of a Ringo style today. Ringo was tasty, uncluttered, appropriate, perfect timing and incredibly creative. Another way of viewing his playing which probably only musicians can understand is how much space he left in the tracks some called it simple I call it tasty. Simply put Ringo invented playing \u201cinside\u201d. If you listen to Dave Garabaldi of Tower of Power you will hear a total inside drummer but in a very different style. Everything single thing Steve Gadd plays today is inside. Another side of Ringo rarely understood outside of musicians is where he sat in the beat. Ringo played ever so slightly behind the beat rather then out in front of the beat like Bonham or Baker particularly or what most hard rock drummers do today. The R&B coming out of Motown in the 60s also had that slightly behind the beat feel which did two things: it kept the song from rushing and it gave the beat a more solid feel. In this regard both Bonham and Baker and Mitchell as well would have ruined the Beatles \u201c sound.\u201d If there were a drummer today that had to play for the Beatles other then Ringo it would not be Neil P or Stew Copeland it would be Steve Gadd. Ringo\u2019s influence is felt in nearly every studio drummer today who nearly all play in the format he pioneered. He was every bit as powerful a creative force in the Beatles as the others. The work he did on songs like \u201cCome Together\u201d was masterful, every living drummer today knows that power and influence of Richard Starkey. Ringo deserves the Grammy, the Academy Award and the Nobel Prize for drumming. Was he the greatest drummer? Irrelevant question! Was he influential? That is the question. ",
