            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. There are a few reasons but since you get this problem only when you play higher notes, I believe this is because you are blowing too hard for higher notes. And then my next conclusion is that you need to review your basic technique. Please remember that your blow should be constant whether you are playing higher notes or lower. Only the size of hole in between your lips should get smaller for higher notes. This can be explained by one simple example. Observe how a gardener waters his plants. For nearby plants he keeps the hole of water pipe fully open and water falls nearby. But when he wants to water plants that are a little further away, he doesn\u2019t run to turn the tap to increase the flow. With flow of water being constant he keeps a finger in front of mouth of pipe to make it smaller and with same force the water travels further. Ditto for flute. You have to keep your blow constant. You only have to reduce the size of hole in between lips. With smaller hole and constant blow you should be able to play higher notes without much difficulty. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like your sound is not well supported. So you need to go back to making a decent tone in the low register. Get Trevor Wye\u2019s practise book for tone (book 1) and start there. Do every exercise. There are no excuses for poor tone. It\u2019s just a matter of practise. Many people who have only been playing a few years move into the top register and the tone becomes thinner and airy as they ascend. They don\u2019t have the understanding of the basics, which is sad as some time spent doing long notes and tone exercises early pay dividends later. ",
