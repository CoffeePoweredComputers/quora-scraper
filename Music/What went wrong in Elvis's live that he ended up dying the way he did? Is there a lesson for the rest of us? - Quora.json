            "answer_text": "Yes of course. The lesson is that you never stop learning. Be aware. His Manager was an incompetent con man. He never realized that because he did not look around. He did not engage meaningfully with others in the same profession to find out whats going on. To determine if he is being gypped when he had to pay 50 % of the gross. He didn\u2019t think of ways to serve his country without putting his career on hold. He didn\u2019t think of the side effects of the drugs that were given to him, even though his mother died from drug side effects. . He didn\u2019t stop to think that dating a 14 year old girl would come back and bite him, when he really fell in love with someone else. He didn\u2019t have the discipline to stop. He had to ask her parents to let her come and live with him. He never developed any discipline.He cocooned himself with sycophants because he was too timid and shy and intimidated to make new friends. This limited his ability to learn. In essence he suffered from a lack of passion. Maybe a lack of ambition. He was OK with the status quo although it was not making the most of his talent. He wanted to be a serious actor but never thought to improve his acting skills by taking acting lessons. Learning is a lifelong process. He didn\u2019t know that. ",
