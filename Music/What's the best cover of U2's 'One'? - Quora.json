            "answer_text": "Tthe original is of course the best, but thats not the question you asked, so the covers in descending order of quality would be Damian Rice, simply outstanding, Cash next, and then one of the below following on. Overload, Dami Im, Mica Paris, Warren Haynes and Jerry Fish werent bad and each gave the song different directions,but the song suits Irish accent so well, the American ones covering it tend to sound not quite so genuine. Personally I didnt enjoy the Mary J one, its way OTTP though her voice is fine of course. To finish I would reiterate that U2 did it best, if you not seen the version in Italy, Milan, where Brian Eno et all come on, then listen on youtube now. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know if it is the best cover of U2\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d, but Warren Haynes (Gov\u2019t Mule/The Allman Brothers) does a beautiful version of it in concert sometimes. The few times I have heard him play \u201cOne\u201d it is just him on acoustic guitar. The simplicity of the arrangement (he is an accomplished guitar player), with his honeyed voice is just gorgeous and really speaks to the depth and empathy of the piece. I also think he is one of the sweetest guys I have worked with.   ",
