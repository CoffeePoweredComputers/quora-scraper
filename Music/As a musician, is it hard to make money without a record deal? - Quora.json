            "answer_text": "Record Deals are a thing of the past \u2026\u2026\u2026 They are really no longer given, especially now with the virus pandemic. Artists and bands nowadays promote themselves and try to sell product online. Prior to this pandemic, the music industry as a whole, shifted to live performances as a way to make money, and recorded material is mainly, but not totally, relegated to being sold at merch tables at the performer\u2019s shows, although, as i said before, some product can be, and is , sold online \u2026\u2026\u2026..Nowadays, records companies act more like performer /artist/band management services, as well as distributors and marketers \u2026\u2026\u2026. Maybe the smaller ones may still dabble in artist development, but the larger ones certainly don\u2019t and all they do is basically manufacture and/or distribute content, whether back catalog or new, for their more successful artist roster.

            "answer_text": "It's funny seeing this after looking for some music distributors. It depends on if you want to pay a little money. There are distributors online that will put your music online and give you some, or all of the money. You have to pay for these. It's harder but not impossible. It will also be harder to get your name out there with out a record deal. If you're interested, I'm looking at something called Level. Here are the prices.  I was not played by level, and have no idea if level is a good service. It seems okay. I hope this helps. ",
