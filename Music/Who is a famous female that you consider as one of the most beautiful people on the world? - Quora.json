            "answer_text": "While not superstar famous or a household name she is an actress so i\u2019m choosing her anyway.    This is Katie McGrath. Everything about her is just stunning. She has a jawline that looks like it was carved by angels and eyes that are so full of kindness that I can\u2019t help but smile. Plus look at the colour! Just beautiful. She looks great in anything she wears, the contrast between her dark hair, stunning eyes and pale skin honestly makes me weak. Which is funny because anyone who knows me thinks I prefer blondes. And not only does she look like an angel who came to Earth, she\u2019s got the absolute softest voice. She\u2019s from Ireland so her accent has a strong Irish twang to it, and usually that\u2019s not my thing at all, but on her it works so damn well. Everytime I watch the shows she\u2019s in or I see any video of her I can\u2019t help but smile like a school girl with a crush (I totally have a crush on her, how could I not?). Shes funny, shes smart, she\u2019s cute, she\u2019s down to Earth, she\u2019s hot as hell, there isn\u2019t a bad bone in her body and she plays both the good and the bad girl brilliantly. She\u2019s got the sort of personality that I love and the sort of personality i\u2019m drawn to in a person. And her smile just radiates love and positivity! Her smile could honestly lighten up a whole room.  Okay, i\u2019m going to stop now, because I could honestly gush on all day about how beautiful of a person I find her to be and i\u2019m sure there are other people who want to answer this question too.

            "answer_text": "SHANIA TWAIN HAS \u2018PERFECT\u2019 FACE, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS Shania is the one for me.  We all know Shania Twain has perfected the art of the pop-country crossover hit, but now scientists believe they've discovered the dimensions of the most attractive female face in the singer's lovely visage. BBC News reports that the key to the ideal arrangement of a woman's facial features is the measurement between her eyes, mouth, and ears. The study was led by the University of Toronto in the songbird's Canadian homeland, with the findings published in the journal Vision Research. Students rated the attractiveness of color photographs of the same woman's face, laid out side by side. Using Photoshop software, the researchers altered the vertical distance between the eyes and mouth, and the horizontal distance between the eyes in each image, but didn't alter the features themselves (no computer-enhanced nose jobs or collagen injections!) The research suggested that the most attractive distance between a woman's eyes and mouth should be just over a third -- or 36 percent -- of the overall length of her face, from hairline to chin, and the space between a woman's pupils should be 46 percent of the width of her face from ear to ear. Women who do not fit those criteria have no need to resort to plastic surgery, however, since things like hairstyle could be used to create the optical illusion of perfect dimension. And while the study was great news for Shania, the features of actress Angelina Jolie don't impress them much, as researchers determined her face didn't fit the ideal ratio for length or width. It still depends on a guy, you know guys have different thoughts in regards to women. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Now this one I guaranteed. ",
