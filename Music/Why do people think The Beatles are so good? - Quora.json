            "answer_text": "Well, it wasn\u2019t just one thing. They were young and ambitious, especially John and Paul. They came up the hard way and honed their live skills in Hamburg playing long hours in clubs. They were really great singers - again John and Paul especially, and they took to songwriting and really excelled at that, and the general public got to see and hear it with each record they put out. They were good musicians that could play a wide variety of styles, unlike a lot of blues and rock and roll based groups around that time. They weren\u2019t the greatest musicians technically, but they had great and innovative musical ideas that went on and on. They had a manager that could get them work, and a producer, George Martin who was classically trained and game for their material - he was extremely important and knew what he was doing. They hit their stride just at the right time in history, sort of like Elvis Presley did. They were smart, articulate and very clever and they knew popular music and rock and roll. To me, they were a unique, kind of sweet and sour mixture - Lennon being the powerful, bitter and biting voice and McCartney the very musical, multi skilled and sweet side of it. And don\u2019t forget George Harrison - his guitar parts and memorable solos in the studio were always top notch - not an easy task at all. He also became a great songwriter and singer despite working in the shadow of John and Paul\u2019s massive outputs and egos. Ringo star was a drummer who understood the songs and played accordingly, had a good feel and didn\u2019t overplay- that\u2019s rare. The variety of their music was amazing and often ahead of the times, and their massive popularity gave them a freedom do produce great and innovative songs and sounds. Hey, they were just GOOD\u2026that\u2019s about it. It can\u2019t happen again - just one of those things\u2026.TC ",

            "answer_text": "Although I'm having a difficult time understanding why you're asking this question I will try to answer because I feel you must not know the Beatles to even have to ask it. As an 11 year old child in 1963, I was deeply affected by the murder of President Kennedy. The horror and tragedy and brutality of that act; seen on television over and over again, affected my psyche. I was inconsolable. One night, I believe it was a Friday night because I was up late, I saw a newsreel of The Beatles and thought to myself \u201cwow\u201d but left it at that. Then that next January 1964 one of my friends brought the Meet The Beatles album to a bunch of us. I never heard anything like that; they were so upbeat, there was so much emotion and joy in their songs; it was exciting; they were exciting. They looked different, their hair was longer than anyone we had ever seen before; but it was short by today's standards. No music was like that; no clothes were like that; no boots were like that; no haircuts were like that; no sound was like that. I was able to smile again. I found joy in their music. I felt like I was part of a worldwide love, of a worldwide singular entity. And when the following month they came to New York and I got to see them on Ed Sullivan and listen to the local New York radio stations covering them I felt a burden released from me. I was smiling again I was excited. I felt joy. I smiled and I sang. I sang like I never sang before from the bottom of my heart with enthusiasm and with gusto. When they sang She Loves You there was emotion; \u201cbecause SHE LOVES YOU!\u201d and that pure emotion in that sound just captured me. I Want to Hold Your Hand was a vivid song full of spirit. Every single person I knew was changed from that moment of February 9th 1964, when they appeared on Ed Sullivan. Boys started growing their hair out; girls changed too. People started forming bands; guitar sales went up guitar lessons went up. The whole world changed literally. And as they grew some of us did not want them to change but they did and so we did too and we became more involved and more mature and more introspective. And people continued to be influenced by them not only up to 1970; not only up through Abbey Road; but through today. If you listen to The Beatles and if you try to put yourself back in the day you will understand the significance of them. Their music still holds up today. You play their music to young people and they like it for the most part and those of us who are now old or getting old can still turn on any Beatles song and feel that same emotion and whatever other emotions time brought along in their lives. They are honored today with radio shows, specials, anniversaries and there's a reason for it. They changed the way people dressed; they changed the way people thought; they changed the way people enjoyed music; they changed the way people played music. This is why the Beatles are adored and this is why they will always be relevant. This is why they are special to me. Perhaps someone with a great knowledge of music can explain it technically but I am explaining it emotionally. They saved me. They brought me joy. ",
