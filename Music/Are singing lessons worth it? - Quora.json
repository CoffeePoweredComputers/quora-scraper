            "answer_text": "Vocal lessons are generally private, one on one lessons. The teacher needs to focus on the sound you are making and the things you are doing with your voice. Research teachers in your area, or online, and set up a trial for them to evaluate you, and for you to evaluate if you are compatible with the teacher, or if they can match your learning style. These days, if you have a good internet connection, Skype and other video phone can be used, but in person is much more preferable, as the teacher can see better exactly what you are doing. The actual lesson depends on the length and teacher, and what your voice needs work on that day. For half hour lessons, they are compact. 5\u201315 minutes of warm up and vocal exercises, and the remaining time is for singing selected pieces and working on technique as you sing, a line at a a time, and then full out at the end. The teacher will guide you based on the priority or progression of the vocal corrections you need. For hour lessons, probably 20\u201325 minutes of warm up and technique exercises, another 10\u201315 on song guidance and singing line by line, and then the remaining time is used for song practice end to end. I like the hour format better, but I am a biweekly student, so the teacher has cut lessons to half hour only for biweekly, and I am back to half hour lessons that I have not had since I started four years ago. She has hour lessons offered for weekly students, but I don\u2019t practice regularly enough for that, plus it\u2019s more cost prohibitive. If you can afford ongoing lessons with a great teacher, that is preferred. If not, a limited set of lessons with a teacher who is knowledgeable about the science of the voice and applying technique along with physics lessons about sound, and can also guide you in sound quality improvement with technique, and performance as well. Vocal lessons should be professionally recorded and made available to you for your awareness building and vocal practice. You should then practice correctly between lessons, so you can make progress. Singing, as with most things, cannot be learned and improved upon by time in the studio alone. You have to practice regularly. At a minimum, warming up correctly and practicing technical exercises, from breathing to diction, is required daily or almost daily. If you are not practicing, the teacher will be able to tell, and great teachers do not have time to waste on students who do not listen to their guidance, who do not practice, and make no improvement as a result of poor choices about practice. If you\u2019re going to take vocal lessons, find a truly qualified teacher based on references, do trials first, and ensure you are going to put in the time and energy (and money) into it. A short stint of quality lessons is better than many poor quality ones. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you want to achieve. If all you want to do is to sing in the shower then no, there is no point in paying money to someone to help you do that - you\u2019ll be fine to just go ahead and sing. If you want to sing in a folk band who rehearse for an hour a week and do 20 minutes at the odd gig here and there - no need to take lessons, but it may well help if you do. If you want to be a professional opera singer then it\u2019s a bit like saying \u201cI\u2019d like to be a surgeon and I\u2019m fully qualified because I read a book on anatomy and I\u2019m very good with a sharp knife\u201d. Yes, you really really will need to take lessons in order to ensure, at the very least, that you are not doing anything now that will damage your career in the long run. If you want to sing in a professional rock and roll band then you can probably get away with singing without lessons, but after a few days of singing you\u2019ll start to lose your voice and have to cancel gigs. At that point your manager will send you to a teacher to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again. What your average person in the street doesn\u2019t realise, is that a singing teacher doesn\u2019t teach you to sing. Everyone can do that anyway. A singing teacher teaches you how to use your body to properly control your voice, so that you get to achieve what you want to achieve without wrecking your vocal chords. If you have ever wanted your voice to sound different and can\u2019t get it to make the noise you wnat it to make, then you need a singing teacher. If you have ever wondered why your throat hurts when you\u2019ve been singing for a while, then you need a singing teacher. If you have ever wished you could hold a note for longer, the way that professional singers can do, then you need a singing teacher. If, on the other hand, you are happy doing what you are doing, then no you don\u2019t need a singing teacher. But even then, you\u2019d probably enjoy it even more if you did get one. Your choice! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Taking lessons from a professional will teach you how to control your breath and your voice. Breath control is the most important element in being able to sing properly. It can take many years to master this, but once you are starting to get it right you will find that it becomes easier to control your voice. Breathing techniques include how to actually breathe in properly, how to control your diaphragm, how to use your rib cage as a kind of bellows, how to protect your vocal chords, and many other important techniques. Singing quietly is probably one of the hardest things - anyone can belt out a loud tune - but being able to sustain and control your voice in the quiet moments requires plenty of practice. You don\u2019t have to have a fantastic soloist\u2019s voice to warrant taking lessons. I have never been a professional soloist, apart from a few small amateur roles, but have sung in many choirs and small groups. Taking singing lessons is a great benefit to any one who sings. ",

            "answer_text": "Is learning how to do what (you say) you want to do worth it? A voice teacher can give you directions to where (you say) you want to go. But you have to make the trip. You, on your own, every day, for months, years, until you get there. It\u2019s not unlike asking for directions from a stranger, hoping that a) the person will know how to get there, and b) will be willing to share that information for free. With a voice teacher, giving vocal/musical directions is a person\u2019s occupation, one that requires study and training and, therefore, a fee is charged. Of course, you could ask your bestie whether you sound good, or your boyfriend or your folks, or anyone (everyone) on social media. I figure you might prefer to save time and energy, and go with a pro. And bear in mind that nearly all of the work you will do alone, but you can (as many singers, amateurs and pros, often do) hire a teacher for a \u2018checkup\u2019 - to ensure whether you\u2019re doing things correctly. Regular, hands-on vocal instruction is important during the \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how come\u2019 stage, when we\u2019re learning how things work, and a regimen (good habits) to keep them working well. Once we understand what to do, weekly lessons are not as necessary for some, but crucial for others. There is often a lot of un-learning to do, and a lot of hand-holding or tough-love needed to get some people to stay the course; only the teacher and student can decide. So ask yourself: is singing better, is developing a strong, flexible, resonant, consistently reliable voice worth it? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is absolutely worth it if you want to be a better singer. However, ensure that your vocal coach is a good one and really knows what he or she is talking about if you want your progress to be quicker, since he or she will be able to help you get out of your problems in case you face a road block in your development. From my experience, my progress in singing was pretty slow until I met a vocal coach who is really good and not only fixes my technique flaws (such as unnecessary jaw tension and extremely nasal tone) and expands my vocal range from E4 to G4 (or even A4 on a really good day), but also feeds me constantly with music theory and interval recognition.

A good voice coach will understand what you\u2019re aiming for and will teach you the techniques of placement and breat support so you can sing as you wish without the risk of damage to your voacal mechanisms. There are plenty of stories of rather famous vocalists who wound up needing vocal rest or worse yet, surgery because they never got proper instruction. Don\u2019t make that error. ",

Anyone considering being a singing in any kind of professional capacity should most definitely seek at least a few sessions with a skilled vocal trainer. This goes for people rocking sold out stadiums even down to little bar bands that want to improve their sound. The instructor should tailor lessons to suit the needs of the singer. They should teach note clarity as and power as well as things like gating to decrease volume without losing power or intensity. Metal singers will need things like proper scream techniques so they don't strain their vocal chords. It's worth noting that tone should also be heavily studied, and unlike guitar, you can't just go buy new gear to change your vocal tone (technically you can, but you shouldn't) ",

They are immediate feedback when you do something right or something wrong and are essential if you're serious about singing. ",

Alongside performing professionally as a singer, I run a small teaching studio in London and a LOT of our students have made a start independently before coming to lessons but then found that they hit a wall that they couldn\u2019t break through without getting a bit of help. If you\u2019d like to chat about lessons you can get in touch with me via the website of my studio Workbox Music | Singing, Piano and Music Theory Lessons | London . Good luck with it! ",
