The astronaut and NASA employee selection process is very long and stressful, but if you know your stuff, and are capable of advanced problem solving you should do well. Even if you went to a Liberal Arts College in mid state Kansas you should be OK, counting on of course your knowledge and skills in the job you are applying for. Now it does help to have a selective Engineering school on your resume but if you know your stuff, they'll know it. As long as you meet the requirements you will put through the same tests as the people with spectacular schools such as MIT and Stanford on their list. ",
