You will be surprised to know that the use of botulinum for therapeutic and aesthetic demonstrates a market of $3.4 globally Dropbox (DBX) Another noteworthy company that you must consider for investment purpose is the DropBox. Even though, this company cannot be compared with the biggest giants like Microsoft and Alphabet as they offer free storage via G-suit and Microsoft 365. But, the company believes that it can give valuable third party services, and G-suite and Microsoft are not two of its biggest partners As per an analyst, the company\u2019s premium model allows for an effective customer acquisition, high levels of customer retention and considerable revenue with a number of upsell opportunities. The company has also acquired HelloSign for $230 million. This major acquisition has provided DBX with an opportunity to diversify further and win more shares for the customers. Salesforce (CRM) Another company where you can choose to invest is the Salesforce.com: The Customer Success Platform To Grow Your Business. This company is a market-share leader for sure. The company sure consists of revolutionary products and a strong business culture, led under the super vision of a visionary CEO. Its most recent update is the Einstein Visual Search which enables users to take a picture on their mobile phones and then search for similar products. Other than this, its business fundamentals are strong and would even get better if its adoption of SaaS and data analytics increases Given a $180 price target, analysts have selected CRM as no 1 company for investment in 2019 .

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m the co-founder of Apteo, a company that uses AI to help stock investors make better decisions. In this answer I\u2019ll be referencing Milton, our first product, which is an AI-powered analytics tool for stock investors. Another disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and none of the below should be construed as advice or recommendations for an individual to buy or sell any securities. \u2014 Figuring out good shorts is certainly a challenging task. With that said, I\u2019m going to give it a shot. My company has developed an artificial intelligence tool called Milton to help analyze stocks, and right now it\u2019s pretty bearish on the following two companies. 1. AIG  AIG has lost a lot of money on underwriting and has significant problems in the larger macro economy, including interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit, and market conditions. It\u2019s had some significant structural changes among its management, and is losing market cap steadily, with significant room to continue. The Milton score on AIG is abysmal and Milton is predicting AIG to underperform virtually every other large cap US stock.  News - Here are some articles to help get started on research: AIG to Incur Catastrophe Loss: Will the Stock Sink Further?Is AIG Doomed to Have a Terrible 2019 Too?2. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT)  Goodyear is another stock that\u2019s been hit by macro issues. It has seen its costs for raw materials go up and the demand for its products go down, and is also seeing increased competition in the tire industry. Its Milton score right now is a 2/100 for the next 1-year, and it looks like it has a ways to go to continue falling.  News Goodyear Tire Dips to 52-Week Low: What's Behind the Fall?\u2014 Hopefully this helps you get started with research. Finding shorts are tough, but I\u2019ve noticed that it helps to follow a downtrend in companies that are struggling against multiple headwinds. If you\u2019re interested in doing further analysis on these or any other companies, you may want to check out the news analytics and Milton\u2019s view on www.milton.ai. ",
