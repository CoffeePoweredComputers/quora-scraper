            "answer_text": "This may have been the greatest marketing play of all time. But that is up for speculation. Only Paul and Ringo know for sure. In \u2018Glass Onion\u2019 John sings \u201cHere\u2019s another clue for you all, the Walrus was Paul.\u201d Supposedly the Walrus is a Scandinavian symbol for death. Back then, there were nightly radio shows dedicated to the \u201cPaul is Dead\u201d rumor. And the greatest phenom was playing the \u201cNumber 9\u201d in Revolution #9 backwards; it says \u201cTurn Me On Dead Man.\u201d I think one can hear it on Youtube. Kids were scouring their records for more clues and people were buying more Beatle records. Paul is of course alive and well and still current and relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh my goodness that\u2019s an old old old story. Of course it started in the US. Because in England they all knew he didn\u2019t die. It was some college kids. Too much time on their hands. And we\u2019re obsessed with digesting the Beatles album covers. They put together so much info that leads to the mass confusion. But what many Beatle fans have to say about it. Is maybe you can give someone reconstructive surgery. But how do you find someone with the same talent. YouTube it is probably a good way to hear a whole bunch of nonsense about it. You must be a Youngin? Any of us that have been around for years and years and years I from the very beginning know the story. I never fell for it. Like I said maybe you can get a look-alike which would be pretty rare. How can you get a look-alike with his talent? ",
