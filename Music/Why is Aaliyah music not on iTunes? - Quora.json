            "answer_text": "Aaliyah\u2019s music is not only not on iTunes, it is not on any digital music service. Even CDs of her music are very hard to find. Why? Because of messy music industry crap. Her label, Blackground Records, is owned by Aaliyah\u2019s uncle, Barry Hankerson. Blackground still exists, but apparently it doesn\u2019t currently have a distribution deal with any of the music publishers. Hankerson owns the master recordings of all of Aaliyah\u2019s music except her first album; that\u2019s why it can still be found. Hankerson refuses to sell the masters or release new recordings if it. Why? Who knows? Maybe he\u2019s hoping someone will drop a crazy amount of money in front of him. Maybe he\u2019s so sentimental he just can\u2019t give up his niece\u2019s music. He isn\u2019t saying. ",

            "answer_text": "Aaliyah\u2019s Music Catalogue is not on iTunes except first Album \u201cAge ain\u2019t Nothin but a Number\u201d . The rest of it is not on iTunes because the record label is defunct and the joint ventures of the other labels which the other albums came out under are in some legal bind to where it\u2019s not available. This is so unfortunate because her estate could be still ranking in so much money. Also, I believe her mother has something to do with it. She doesn\u2019t want anything out of her daughter , I\u2019m not sure why but I just think of something I heard before: Her family, especially her mother is still taking the loss hard. Before Aaliyah was Aaliyah to the world, she was Aaliyah to her Family first. ",
