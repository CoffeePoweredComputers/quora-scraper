            "answer_text": "To enjoy Eurovision, you need to understand exactly what it is. Eurovision is an exclusive contest amongst various European and a few near-European countries to find the best original song. The key word is original. It is not necessarily the best song, the catchiest tune, the best pop song or even the best sung song. It is a competition of mostly non-English speaking countries, with contestants either singing as best they can in English or singing in their native tongue, not fully understood by the majority of other listening nations. Songs often draw on local music customs and hence there are lots of folk songs. It is a show, so the spectacle of the performance is almost as important as the actual song. There are lots of rules that must be followed and always plenty of politics involved in the voting. Eurovision mostly attracts unknown singers or bands, as they attempt to get their big break. Established, famous singers or bands are too busy releasing music directly into the charts to want to waste time with the Eurovision contest. There are few songs/performers that come out of Europe that break into the the US music market (other than the U.K., no longer considered a European country). Most of the popular music in the US comes from the US, with some coming from the UK and occasionally countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc. Music that is popular in Europe is often not popular in the US because of cultural differences. Eurovision celebrates their local cultural differences, so songs considered bad by non-Europeans are often very popular within Europe. Of course, some songs are considered bad everywhere, and every year there are a bunch of Eurovision songs rejected by most European countries. There are also some songs considered good everywhere. Perhaps the best example is ABBA and their break out \u201cWaterloo\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. I\u2019ve watched every contest since 1977 and I was at the Birmingham 1998 contest. The Eurovision Song Contest is big. It started in 1956, with just 6 participating countries. Over the 60 years of the annual contest, it has grown with over 40 countries regularly taking part. It one of the largest live televoting events and regularly has international audience of over 100 million across Europe and beyond. It\u2019s regularly transmitted in Australia, New Zealand and sometimes Japan. In the United Kingdom, approximately 37% of Saturday night television viewers tune in to watch. In Sweden, the share is over 80%. In Belgium, Cyprus, Iceland and Austria, over half these countries\u2019 viewers are watching. [1] On the occasion of the 60th contest, nearly 200 million people tuned in. [2] The Eurovision makes an impact. It helped launch Celine Dion\u2019s career when she won in 1988. Bucks Fizz\u2019s chart success started after their 1981 win. And there\u2019s the legendary success of ABBA. Katrina and the Waves, Sandy Shaw, Cliff Richard (twice), Olivia Newton-John, Lulu and Engelbert Humperdrinck have all represented the UK. As well as launching ABBA\u2019s international career, the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest played a part in the Portugal\u2019s \u2018Carnation Revolution\u2019 military coup. There were secret signals in the coup, one of which was the airing of the Portuguese Eurovision entry \u201cE Depois do Adeus\u201d. As well launching ABBA and the Portugal\u2019s \u2018Carnation Revolution\u2019, the 1974 Contest\u2019s top 4 songs all went into the top 10 of the UK music charts. The 1974 Brighton hosted contest was a commercial and (literally) a revolutionary success. After all, it\u2019s a contest not a showcase. The Eurovision Song Contest is a television programme in search of a winning song, not a future musical career. But then Eurovision has produced some remarkably successful songs including \u2018Nel blu dipinto di blu\u2019 - better known \u2018Volare\u2019, which was the Italian entry coming in the 1958 Contest. There\u2019s also \u201cFly on the Wings of Love\u201d which has been subsequently covered and Spain\u2019s 1973 entry \u201cEres tu\u201d, which pushed Cliff Richard\u2019s \u201cPower to all our friends\u201d into third place. Nicole\u2019s 1982 German winner \u201cA little peace\u201d was the 500th UK number chart one. It may or may not be bad, but don\u2019t knock Eurovision. It watched by millions across Europe, has 40 participating countries, launched ABBA and a revolution and has had some commercial success.
