            "answer_text": "Sometimes they are on salary to a record label or a production company. Sometimes they are just outstanding as far as a reputation and can be hired by the band. Sometimes a record label or production company will retain a known person for a single video. MOST TIMES these people are media production staff for the production company. There are times when college students in media arts get to do a video because they work cheap and want the experience. UNLIKE MOVIES, videos have A PRODUCER not a director. Big budget films need a director to help focus things on site of a shoot. Many videos are filmed in a studio or warehouse with digital backgrounds and effects digitally added. ",
