            "answer_text": "Spotify is our #1 platform that people listen to our podcast through. We have 20% more people listening to The Email Marketing Show through Spotify than through Apple Podcasts. I think the reasons are probably: More people already have Spotify so use what they\u2019re already familiar with.Spotify have a MUCH better method of discovering new podcasts than Apple.Spotify works across all systems, Mac, PC, Phone, Tablet. One system to listen to all audio stuff.(Aside: strangely we get a high number of people listening through the player embedded on our website - I think that\u2019s pretty weird!) ",
