            "answer_text": "I define vibrato as \u201can undulation of tone that is the inevitable result of a relaxed, supported vocal tone.\u201d This begs some explaining. By \u201cinevitable,\u201d I mean if you are vocalizing correctly (from a classical and vocal health standpoint), an adult voice (and most adolescent voices) will produce vibrato, which I\u2019ll describe a little later. By \u201crelaxed,\u201d I mean a voice that is free of tension, even in the higher regions. The singer is comfortable intoning high pitches without stress or strain or the need to lift the chin, though higher notes will involve added subglottic pressure. This is normal and not a sign of poor technique. By \u201csupported,\u201d I mean the power that \u201cthrows\u201d the voice is derived from the diaphragm, which is the hood of muscles over the abdominal organs. When engaged, it flattens downward, dropping the floor of the thoracic cavity. This stretches the lungs, which in turn creates negative pressure, causing air to rush in. It is important that air be moved to the bottom of the lungs because it is both easier to get a full breath, and because it provides a more stable foundation for a consistent tone. Now someone will ask, \u201cHow does all this work to create vibrato?\u201d Vibrato is a combination of two phenomena, one aerodynamic and the other neuromuscular. As air is expelled from the lungs by the controlled relaxation of the diaphragm (which, when relaxed, will rise and drive or squeeze out the air\u2014this is the one and only place that you shoud engage any kind of tension), it passes through the trachea, which is a fleshy tube supported by a number of cartilaginous rings. Add to the fact that air, when moving from two engaging directions\u2014left lung and right lung\u2014creates a cyclone, the resultant airstream has an undulating effect. So the air coming up the bronchi into the trachea and, ultimately, through the larynx between the vocal cords has a \u201cwavy\u201d or pulsing shape, which will translate physically to the pressure wave your vocal cords are producing. Additionally, there is a neural signal being sent from your brain to the vocal cords to create a pitch. This signal is sent at a particular frequency; it is not (nor does it need to be) sent constantly. You can \u201clock\u201d the vocal chords into the position that produces tone at a particular frequency, but this defeats the purpose of a free, relaxed tone. Nevertheless, the signal is sent from the brain regularly (that is, at a more or less consistent rate) that is natural to your instrument, though it is safely adjustable within reasonable limits. Too much wobble, for instance, is not a natural vibrato any more than a locked up, trill-like vibrato\u2014but there are people whose voices naturally work this way. As the brain signal is sent, the vocal cords flex, in reaction to the pulsing airstream. This creates a core pitch that doesn\u2019t have to change (and, for most singers, really shouldn\u2019t), but involves an undulation that is perceived as a pitch wave. These two phenomena combing to form natural vibrato in the voice. Okay, now we\u2019re ready to tackle \u201chumming vibrato.\u201d Humming is nothing more than singing on [m] (or maybe [n]). If my normal, supported singing creates vibrato, my humming will as well, unless I use a non-standard (non-classical) vocal technique. The larynx doesn\u2019t care what position my lips are in; if my tone is supported and relaxed, it will generate vibrato, because as far as my larynx is concerned, it\u2019s just regular singing. No vowels, consonants, or anything else that can be affected by the embouchure (opening of the mouth), so if my normal singing produces vibrato, my humming should, too. The reality is that most of us do not hum at full voice. We do not typically engage the voice in a classical way (there\u2019s no need to produce the air support pressure that the singer \u201cleans\u201d on\u2014called appoggio), so there is insufficient (if any) subglottic activity to shape the upstream of air. And with that reduced air pressure, there isn\u2019t a lot of pressure to resist on the vocal cords. Basically, the two factors that normally create vibrato\u2014air pressure (support) and vocal resistance (NOT TENSION)\u2014are removed from the equation. If you hear someone humming with vibrato, they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong, but unless they\u2019re humming loudly, the vibrato is probably a habitual fluctuation rather than a supported phenomenon. If they\u2019re humming without vibrato, they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong or hurtful unless they try to project it loudly, and then it\u2019s probably only a problem if they\u2019re trying to hum-scream high notes. In that case, I would assume the person is doing so in response to pain\u2014or will be before long! ",
