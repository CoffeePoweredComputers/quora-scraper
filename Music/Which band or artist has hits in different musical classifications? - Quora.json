            "answer_text": "The Beatles, hands down. This is in part because there were so prolific. There are groups like the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful that covered quite a range of styles, from \"Daydream\" to \"Summer in the City.\" But with only a dozen or so hits to their credit, there's only so much range that can be covered. The Beatles had a good seven or eight years, but they also developed musically very rapidly. Starting from early 1960s covers of late 50s rock 'n roll \u2013 Kansas City, Roll Over, Beethoven; to covers of Motown's \"You've Really Got Hold on Me\" and \" The Broadway show tune \"Till There Was You\" in their first year, to their own rock sound with songs like \"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\" and \"Love Me Do,\" they rapidly moved on to the more innovative sounds of \"Help!\" and \"A Hard Day's Night. Add \"Yesterday\" and \"Eight Days a Week,\" and in two years they had a range of styles that most groups never duplicated. As they became musically accomplished, the styles of \"Penny Lane;\" \"Fool on the Hill;\" \"Eleanor Rigby;\" \"a Day in the Life;\" \"Sgt. Pepper;\" \"Helter Skelter;\" and \"Julia;\" and in George Harrison's \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something,\" and I don't know of any bands, writer of Broadway hits, or musicians of any other style with the breadth of the Beatles. Interestingly, it seems that Henry Mancini, who wrote the scores for numbers of movies and TV shows, may have the same breadth, although over a much longer period of time. But we are talking about a man who wrote \"Moon River\" and \"Peter Gunn\" in the same year. His ability to match a style to a film earned him a reputation difficult to match in the movie industry.

            "answer_text": "The Beatles are obvious, David Bowie also had huge stylistic variety with his 70s hits, Prince and Kate Bush in the 1980s.  In a short commercial career Blondie are a less obvious choice, there was no one songwriter writing all their hits or one magic combination of proven songwriters. Most band members lended a hand to songwriting and few if any other bands have had massive cross genre hit success in Rock, Reggae, Disco & featured Rap in such a short space of time. They followed their own star too, setting trends rather than following them.  The Clash also had Punk, Post Punk, Disco-Funk, electro rap influenced tracks and the beat poet Allen Ginsberg. Damon Albarn of Blur has also followed an eclectic path Indie Pop & Grunge Hits with Blur, African influences on his work with the Good, the Bad & the Queen and Hip Hop influences on hits with Gorillaz. He\u2019s also released world beat albums, worked on Opera but not had hits in these genres. Over a wider period of time Paul Simon has had success with folk rock, pop rock, South American and with South African musicians. Casting the net wider, many Brazilian Artists should also be included, Jorge Ben for one. ",
