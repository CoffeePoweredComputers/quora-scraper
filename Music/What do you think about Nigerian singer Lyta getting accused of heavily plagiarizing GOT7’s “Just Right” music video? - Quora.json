            "answer_text": "Now, for those of you who don\u00b4t know about this: it was recently revealed that a Nigerian singer called Lyta made a song called \u00b4Hold me down\u00b4. When the MV was released, fans realized that the music video had very similar visuals to Got7\u00b4s MV \u00b4Just Right\u00b4from 2015. KBuzz on Youtube made a video about it:  Here\u00b4s Lyta\u00b4s Hold me down:  And here\u00b4s Got7\u00b4s Just Right:  In the article someone said that Lyta wasn\u00b4t the video producer which could probably be true, but I don\u00b4t have enough information on that so I won\u00b4t say anything. Personally, I think the intro to the video is too similar to the intro in Just Right, but the rest of the video doesn\u00b4t seem like it was copy and pasted from it. I still think that maybe they should apologize, since the it\u00b4s obvious that someone copied it but no hate to either artist. I hope this was helpful, bye. -A ",
