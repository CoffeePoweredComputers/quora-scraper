            "answer_text": "Learn patience. Don\u2019t overdo it. If you find yourself getting choky when trying to force a \u201chigh\u201d note, take a break for the day. You have to treat the process as if it was a day at the gym. Work on specific parts of the voice? or do you do a full body workout in order to increase endurance? My advice is just watch videos on youtube. Study. I know people like to say that those videos give out inaccurate information, but from what I can tell they all have useful bits of information you can use to create your own voice \u201cworkout\u201d regimen. Just remember to be skeptical about it, don\u2019t try and copy the voice on the video when it moves up the scale. work at your own voice\u2019s pace. Most importantly, start a the very beginning. Breathing, Posture and Alignments are the most important things before you even decide to sing. Having a foundation to stand on when you continue to build is more critical than the idea of the building itself. Also, take time to actually workout your body at the gym (cardio), as certain things such as diaphragm muscle (which is very crucial for a singer) can benefit from those activities. ",

            "answer_text": "If you go online & research the term \"vocal pedagogy,\" you can find lots of good information on the structure of the voice, & how to get started. The first thing you want to do is to practice sitting, or standing up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, your shoulders down and back, your knees slightly bent, & your jaw relaxed with your tongue resting on your bottom teeth. T. Then breathe in using your abdominal muscles, making sure to open your mouth & the back of  your throat like you're yawning. Your ribs age shouldexpand, but your chest shouldn't move much. Then, try breathing in through your nose & mouth together like you're smelling something really good. If you're doing it right, you should feel a cool sensation in the back of your throat. Once you've mastered your breathing, you can pull vocal exercises  from the pedagogy websites & build on what you know from there. ",
