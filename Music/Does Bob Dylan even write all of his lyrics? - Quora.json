            "answer_text": "The objective answer is \u2018Yes\u2019. He writes all of his lyrics. Any Lyrics attributed to (Bob Dylan) were written by Bob Dylan, to my knowledge. He doesn\u2019t write all of the lyrics to all of the songs he has recorded. In his first album I know he he covered \u2018House of the rising sun\u2019 and \u2018Man of constant sorrow\u2019. Judging by the sass in your questions through your use of the word \u2018even\u2019 I\u2019m guessing you see this as a bad thing? I hope you\u2019re as tough on actors as you are on songwriters, both artists in their own right. Does Meryl Streep even write all of the movies she\u2019s in? Bob Dylan never claimed he wrote every single lyric that he sang, but damn, he wrote some beautiful songs. ",
