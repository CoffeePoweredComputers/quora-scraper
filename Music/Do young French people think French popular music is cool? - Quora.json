            "answer_text": "A2A. It is not very clear anymore what \u201cFrench popular music\u201d is. Nowadays, the most famous groups making music in French are rap groups using an idiom not understandable by the majority. Young French people, let\u2019s say teenage until late twenties, are very familiar with his type of music, wether they like it or not, because it gets most broadcast and publicity. And it\u2019s supposed to be \u201cbadass\u201d, which young people tend to like . But then when a big figure like Charles Aznavour dies (yes, he was also Armenian\u2026), all the young people ask what the big deal is and they listen to what it sounded like. All old major Aznavour hits have been topping the French charts since yesterday. And the funny thing is that many young people discover them on such occasions. Their reactions are typically a bit startled, as it sounds both fully understandable and yet almost alien. But then they (often) get aware that there is quite an impressive heritage of \u201cold French pop\u201d, with quite a few really big voices and very elaborate lyrics, entwined with the melodic specificities of the language. It does work on \u201cyoung people\u201d, but only gradually.  I rediscovered the French pop heritage myself for example mostly after it had been popular, much more than when I was \u201cyoung\u201d. In the 1980\u2019s, what was cool to listen for young people was\u2026 rock music in English (which hardly anyone could fully understand back then). Now rock has been replaced by hip hop or electro or metal, but what\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d is STILL in English. However, as you get more mature, you often lose interest in shallow stuff, and get to appreciate classics more. That\u2019s how they may serve as inspiration for new artists, with surprising results. Even if Stromae sounds very different from Brel, inspiration gets very obvious when you pay attention. So the answer to the question at this point seems to be no, not really. But \u201cFrench popular music\u201d has quite a consistent heritage only waiting to be rediscovered, once the young French people think Lady Gaga and the like is no longer cool. ",
