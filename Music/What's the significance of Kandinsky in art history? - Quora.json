            "answer_text": "If you take art history in an American high school, surely you will recognize this painting.  This is Improvisation 28 by Vasily Kandinsky, and it displayed an important movement towards abstraction. Kandinsky\u2019s goal here was to get the viewer to respond to the artwork as if it were a musical composition (which is why many of his pieces have titles related to music). There is supposed to be some references to synesthesia because sounds and color are connected in the piece. One main reason he is a significant figure in art history is that he was a member of Der Blaue Reiter movement which broke off from Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung-M\u00fcnchen (NKV) artists. The main reason Kandinsky left NKV was that he wanted more freedom of expression to depict the natural world beyond a literal representation. His belief was that if you can recognize the forms in art, your conscious mind will take over, but if you don\u2019t, you can use your emotional abilities to respond to the form and colors. As seen in Improvisation 28, you cannot see any recognizable physical forms allowing you to interpret the artwork in a subjective way. ",

            "answer_text": "Kandinsky is one of the fathers of abstract painting. Indeed he was believed to be the very first artist to produce an adstract painting, in 1910, with his \"First Abstract Watercolor\". But specialists discovered that this watercolor was indeed produced in 1913 as a preparatory work for his famous Composition 7 done in 1913. The real first abstract painting was indeed made by a Czech painter, Frantisek Kupka, in 1911. Kandinsky keeps being regarded as the first major abstract painter and one of the most brillant philosopher of art. ",
