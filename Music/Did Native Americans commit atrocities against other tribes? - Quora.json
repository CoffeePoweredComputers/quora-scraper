            "answer_text": "Of course! Has any large human population not engaged in atrocities against other groups? However, this topic is related to scale, timeline, location, etc. In this regard, it is still no different than all other populations that engaged in atrocities (or, will engage in them in the future). I\u2019ll give you an example\u2026 Vikings. Pretty brutal people right? Well, this was a northern Germanic group that exploded on the world stage at a specific time and place. They had a warrior culture that valued death in battle and had no moral qualms about killing and plundering. That was part of their overrall world view. However, fast forward a bit through Viking history, and these Norsemen would accept new religious beliefs, mix with different people, and morph into new nations\u2026and actually become a new people. They aren\u2019t static. So, as we go on this theoretical journey and arrive at the present time, we find the \u201cVikings\u201d - or, rather\u2026their descendants. And these Norsemen might call themselves Swedes, or Norwegians, or Icelanders, etc. And these Nordic countries are some of the most liberal and stable nations on the earth. Although, to digress a little bit. Perhaps they took the radical progressive politics a bit too far and now they\u2019ve imported \u201cheathens\u201d from other countries at such high rates, that they are establishing new cultural norms and are tearing down society a bit. But, that is a completely different topic. Back to the Native American atrocity thing\u2026 Look, the other thing to realize is that there are hundreds of tribes in the Americas. Some were more warlike or brutal than others. Heck, some were not warlike at all. And many tribes just maintained a defensive posture against more aggressive neighbors. So, it really depends on what group you are talking about. It would be like asking, \u201cDid Africans commit atrocities against other tribes?\u201d That is a huge continent, and you\u2019d be lumping a lot of distinct cultures and populations together under one umbrella term. It is not very specific. Same goes with this Native question. Who are you talking about here? ",

There were likely also some smaller incidents, but nothing like the scale of the ancient European genocides. The usual pattern was assimilation to one degree or another.

You have to understand that at their height the Comanches had 10k tribes members and wanted to exclusively own 10% of the lands west of the Mississippi. In their system it was simply impossible to sustain themselves. They could never of had say factories or farms which would have sustained millions of people. Like other people have pointed out atrocities are common to man. The land we call China was at one point many tribes but one THE CHIN killed off or chased away all of the others.

First, a reply I made to post answering the first: \u201cGenocide, rare, and more slow and incidental than fully intended; But, massacres\u2014less frequent in the Americas more owing to geography and logistics. One regional example, touching on repeat patterns: \u201cMesa of Sorrows\u201d by James F. Brooks.\u201d For the Southwest region of North America, I recommend James F. Brooks work, having attended a presentation at the University of Arizona Book Fair a few years ago, featuring him, an archaeologist, and a Hopi man who served both as a counselor and as a tribal historian. The latter said that emotions from the massacre of Avat\u2019ovi carried through several centuries to the present, presenting even now as PTSD similar to what he sees from abusive family situations. For definitions: \u201cgenocide\u201d as at least attempted wiping out of a group with its own language; \u201cmassacre\u201d as more than a battle, but killing of more helpless people. ",

( Huron is the most common name given to them by the French that came to Canada in early 1600\u2019s) She passed along this story of the 100 year war between the Wendat tribe and the Mohawk tribe. It was all intermingled with the French and the British that came to Canada during that time. Hurons and Mowhawks had some peace agreements but it was a rocky relationship because they competed for the lands that assured survival. They would regularly ambush each other\u2019s villages. My great grandmother spoke of the young Mohawk men coming of age coming to attack her village and they would scalp some of their victims. It was like a trophy to them. After that, they would leave and go back to where they came from. She also stated that the children were not killed during an ambush. Instead, they were brought back to their respective villages and adopted by the members of the tribe. The children were raised as their own. I do not know why this was done but my great grandmother stated this. Please note that the Hurons sided with the French and the Mohawks sided with the British. Before that, they were at war with each other and it was called the 100 year war. Below is a source the seems to confirm what my great grandmother stated. The French created war between the Iroquois and New France from 1609 to 1701. It was a 92-year war with us. They lost every one and sued for peace to end the wars. The Great Peace of Montreal was made on June 25th 1701, on the summer solstice. Source: Mohawk Nation News Below is an other source that gives an other interesting perspective. The beaver war.

The maya had a very complete written language and many of the Mayan inscriptions record details of their frequent wars between the various Mayan city states and the gruesome aftermaths.

A group of Osage warriors charged into a Kiowa camp and brutally slaughtered the women, children and elderly there. Most of the warriors of this group of Kiowas, headed by Chief A'date or \"Islandman\" had left to raid a band of Utes or had gone bison hunting. The camp was left mainly unguarded and when the Osage came, the Kiowas had no choice but to flee. The Osage killed approximately 150 Kiowa people and took their sacred Tai-me medicine bundle and two children captive.  Cutthroat Gap massacre ",
