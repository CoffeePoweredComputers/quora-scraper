            "answer_text": "The most moving song I\u2019ve ever herd is \u201cEverything\u201d by Lighthouse. I was a5 a Christian camp on a mission trip with my friends when I herd it. We were sitting on the carpet floor watching \u201cThe Everything Skit\u201d while listening to the song. For me, it wasn\u2019t very profound. I sat quietly nodding my head thinking Yup, this is it. The thing people need to hear. I admit, I was stoic. But then, one by one, young boys and young girls, youth leaders, camp counselors and my closet friends started dropping into tears. As everyone around me was impacted deeply (turning to sobs) I was sitting there reevaluating my heart. It wasn\u2019t about what they were feeling. For once, I let myself think about my heart: \u201cAnd how can I stand here with you And not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?\u201d Suddenly it wasn\u2019t about what they needed to hear. It was about what I needed to hear. I walked up to my cabin alone that night and thought long and hard about the lyrics: \u201cFind me here, and speak to me I want to feel you, I need to hear you You are the light that's leading me to the place Where I find peace again You are the strength that keeps me walking You are the hope that keeps me trusting You are the life to my soul You are my purpose You're everything And how can I stand here with you And not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?\u201d I learned that God could reach through a self-righteous heart. He got through mine a stripped away the persona I built up. That was being moved. That was everything. ",

            "answer_text": "One very strong candidate for the \u201cmost moving\u201d piece of music that I\u2019ve ever heard is the Durufle Requiem, performed by Robert Shaw conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (a Telarc CD in my collection). All nine movements of the piece are very moving in their own unique ways, from being overwhelmingly powerful (with floor board rattling pipe organ) to being eerily ethereal in nature. But the one movement that seems to grip and manipulate my feelings in the strongest way is the last movement, \u201cIn Paradisum\u201d. In the last few measures of the vocals (right before the music slowly fades away with strings, harp, and one last very subdued pipe organ note), there is what seems to be a magical and liberating transition as they sing the last line (\u201caeternam habeas requiem\u201d, which translates to \u201cmay you have eternal rest\u201d). If any piece of music could even hint towards conveying what it must feel like for a soul to be released/freed from the body on its journey into Heaven, I\u2019d say that it would have to be this choral masterpiece. Another very moving piece of music (for me) is, perhaps not surprisingly, another requiem: The John Rutter Requiem, performed by Timothy Seelig conducting the Turtle Creek Chorale and the Dallas Women\u2019s Chorus (a Reference Recordings CD in my collection). The sounds of the chorus, the cellist, the soprano soloist, and the pipe organ are superb throughout the piece. In one of the movements, \u201cAgnus Dei\u201d, the chorus builds up volume with a slow crescendo, and finally reaches fortissimo volume levels a little after 4 minutes into the movement. Just before the 5-minute mark (about 2/3 of the way through the movement), the loud voices recede and give way to the harp, some low pipe organ notes, and a flute. At this point, between the first and second phrases played by the flute, there is a transition in the long, sustained low pipe organ note, punctuated by the plucking of the harp strings. It\u2019s really hard for me to put it into words, but something about this is strangely moving to me. The rest of the movement is also quite moving, with the chorus and flute in calm dialogue with each other until the end of the movement (ending with the flute), accompanied by subtle low organ notes.
