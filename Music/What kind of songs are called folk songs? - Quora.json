            "answer_text": "Good question. But what are \u2018folk songs\u2019 ? Back in my schooldays, around the time of rise to prominence of Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez and others, much of THEIR output came to be known as \u2018folk music\u2019. However, I had come to regard \u2018folk songs\u2019 as timeless songs, handed down from generation to generation, such as (in England) \u201cThe Ash Grove\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Fair\u201d, \u201cCherry Ripe\u201d, \u201cOranges and Lemons\u201d or (in Ireland) \u201cShe Moved Through The Fair\u201d, \u201cThe Ballad of Molly Malone (Cockles and Muscles)\u201d In USA, Mickey Newberry combined three folk songs - \u201cDixie\u201d, \u201cBattle Hymn Of The Republic\u201d, and \u201cAll My Trials\u201d, to form his \u201cAmerican Trilogy\u201d, which became a \u2018hit\u2019 for Elvis Presley.

            "answer_text": "Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century, but is often applied to music older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. ",
