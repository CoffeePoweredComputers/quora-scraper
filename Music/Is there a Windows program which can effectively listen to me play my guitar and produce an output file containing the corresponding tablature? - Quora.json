            "answer_text": "Probably not. With a guitar, there are several ways to play any note. Which strong you play this particular C# on will depend on what comes before and after. Which fingering works best. Capturing that data is the only advantage TAB has against standard notation. Standard tells you what notes to play, but leaves it to you to decide how you should play them. So it works across instruments. And a computer might well pick out what note is being played, it sort of takes a guitar player to know on which string and fret - from among the several possibilities - he should use THIS time. Two measures farther along, and he might slide up the neck and play exactly the same note in the same octave, but play it 5 frets up on a lower string. That sounds like a very steep test for a computer. Essentially, it is going to have to understand how a human plays, and makes those choices. ",
