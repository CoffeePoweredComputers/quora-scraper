            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a long-going argument about whether old pianos are better than new ones\u2014particularly with respect to Steinway. You can think what you want about that. I\u2019d go with the new pianos, honestly, even though my own piano is approaching 100. Old pianos by great makers are worth a lot, and that\u2019s at least in part because a 100-year old piano needs a major overhaul. That\u2019s not cheap. (Mine had one at about 70.) And pianos that aren\u2019t great in the first place, that aren\u2019t worth what it costs to rebuild, tend not to get rebuilt. Why spend a few thousands of dollars on an instrument that wasn\u2019t very good in the first place? But that doesn\u2019t really answer the important part of this question. \u201cWorth so much?\u201d Compared to what? Piano models change very, very slowly, so unless you\u2019re looking at a real antique, or a piano whose maker no longer exists, a piano of the same model is probably built today. (That\u2019s true of mine.) So you can look up the price of a new piano of the same model and compare. And you\u2019ll find that the old pianos are selling for roughly half the price of a comparable new instrument. For example, take a Steinway M, which is probably the most common high-end piano out there. New, it lists for about $75,000 (according to pianobuyer.com). On eBay (which isn\u2019t where I\u2019d shop for pianos, but it\u2019s OK for a price check), Ms are going for $20K to $45K (less than I would have thought, though I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s a glut of high-end pianos on the market.) There\u2019s a lot of variation depending on age and how much work has been done on the instrument. But basically, 1/3 to 1/2 of the list for a new instrument. So, on one hand, old pianos are worth a lot because, if they\u2019re any good, they\u2019ve gone through a major restoration at some point. On the other hand, compared to a new piano of the same model, they\u2019re a bargain\u2014IF the restoration is done right. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, this is a complex topic: Piano technicians need to make a living and many do so by rebuilding old pianos. Some of the old upright pianos were well designed, well constructed of good materials and often have wonderful and irreproducible carving and woodwork. Many old pianos have enormous personal or historic importance or value (which is enormously difficult to quantify). But: Pianos devalue as they age; wood deteriorates, finishes decompose, damage and accidents happen, rodents wander, iron and steel rust, even brass and bronze corrodes or fatigues. Rebuilding an old piano requires essentially three steps, disassembly, re-engineering and re-assembly. Building a NEW piano involves only one step, assembly (assuming that the job of design, prototyping and testing have already been done). New pianos are made of all new materials with a full life-span ahead of them and (theoretically) with the experience of hundreds of years of manufacturing behind. Rebuilding an old piano is more time-consuming and expensive than building a new piano. To keep costs down corners must be cut and those cut corners degrade the performance of the instrument. A new piano is cheaper and more reliable. You do not know the outcome of a rebuild and you have to pay for it even if it is a disappointment. A new piano can be evaluated before purchase and comes with a warranty. Discarding a beautiful old piano is a tragedy and a great loss of its history and beauty. So is burying a beloved parent or \u201cputting down\u201d a wonderful pet. Life happens. Interesting, historical and beautiful old pianos need to be preserved and maintained, a few should be rebuilt. For the rest, tearfully say goodbye and send them to the dump. A new piano is cheaper.
