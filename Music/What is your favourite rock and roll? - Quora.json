They are great live, The best in the live concerts according to me. Their performance at 1985 love aid is still considered as the best concert ever. Their versatility is what makes go bits over this band. Just give their songs a try. And also listen to their underrated songs. The list of songs everybody should listen to understand are given below. The show must go on : The most epic song the kingdom of rock n roll has given us. Freddie's voice still raises goosebumps in me.You take my breath away: This song is only Freddie playing the piano and singing out to his loved but alone. No other members are with him. A truly hauntingly beautiful song.Its late: This is my favourite. I intend to play it on my first gig. It has a great guitar riff, couple with Freddie's awesome voice and John's fantastic bass work.39 : D. Brian May at his lyrical best. The song is a study in time and space but with all the live of home in it.",

            "answer_text": "I would choose garage rock bands from the 1960\u2019s. They were the precursors to the punk rock movement and were made up of indie bands who were just starting out to make their own sound. Sometimes they would cover other bands and they would also do their own material. It was a musical genre which was unique in the energy and creativity by the bands that made up that movement. ",
