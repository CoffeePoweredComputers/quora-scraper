            "answer_text": "It depends on my mood. If I am in the mood for music, I listen to a station that has the songs I like (whether 1960s oldies or classic rock or current hits); if I am in the mood for listening to news and current events, I listen to a station that doesn't shout at me but does provide interesting information, one that keeps me up to date.  In all cases, I prefer announcers (or disc jockeys) who are personable and conversational, who make me feel they are talking TO me rather than AT me.   I enjoy announcers who have a sense of humor (even a news/talk station can still be entertaining, rather than seeming as if they are giving me a lecture.  I understand that many news stories are quite serious, and I am not expecting jokes during a story about tragic occurrences.  I am simply saying that I prefer announcers whose tone is suitable to the story, but who can also relate like human beings rather than robots reading the news).  And while in America, most stations are supported by commercial advertising, I prefer a station that does not have so many commercials that the news or the music seems almost secondary. ",
