            "answer_text": "The number of fine pickup crafters has become somewhat prolific these days, and it is going to depend on what you deem sounds best for your ear. The Lollars are excellent as are Lindy Fralin's lines of goodies. I have been using Klein pickups in some builds the last few years after hearing some of the sound files on his site. While listening to Strat pickups the sounds were very good, and then I heard The Jazzy Cat, which was so juicy, over the top Stratty it made me dizzy. His 51 Broadcaster set also had that thing going for me, and besides the original Bardens that are in my own \"Old Piney\", which are the pickups Danny Gatton ran in his Tele (which do not exactly sound like a classic Tele) the Klein Broadcasters have a timbre reminiscent of what I think of when hearing \"Telecaster\". I would absolutely check out curtisnovak.com, O.C. Duff Pickups - Handmade Guitar Pickups, Bill Lawrence Official Website (Wilde and Keystone Pickups), and have a look at  www.fishman.com/products/series/fluence/fluencesignature-gregkoch.php ",

            "answer_text": "You can go down the huge rabbit hole of expensive pickup winders like I and many others did. You'll find some you like and some you don't. I've tried many. Rumpelstiltskin, Don Mare, Lollars, Fralins and more. I gotta say, none of them were better FOR ME than the fender nocaster set. A simple off the shelf set that sounds great and is relatively cheap compared to the other names I listed. Just know that sound quality has little to do with how much a set costs ",
