            "answer_text": "It depends on the piece. There were a lot of pieces that were commissioned either for that particular piece or by hiring the composer to just provide music every week, but of course there were a lot of pieces that were composed either to help someone get a job or just out of fun. There is a piece i performed last week called 'if ye love me, keep my commandment' by William Byrd. It's about 400 years old and I've performed it many times over the years- and it has a funny sort of history. Byrd was a Catholic living in protestant England while it was illegal to be Catholic. So much of his Catholic music was composed in secret and performed by his close friends- all in secret. He was not only not paid for this, it could have cost him his life. However today we still have his music and it's considered some of the very best religious music (for protestants and catholics). Every song has a different story to tell, and it's just as true with old sacred music as with new pop songs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The primary employers of composers at that time were the Church (Catholic or Protestant) and the nobility. Composers were paid for their services. Composers also produced some works for public performance - operas, oratorios, symphonies, etc - and tickets were sold to the public. The rise of the middle class made this more and more possible. There was also a certain amount of music publishing for which they received payment - this became more common toward the latter part of the 18th century. Again, a growing middle class meant there was more demand for music that could be played in the home. Of course, there was nothing stopping a composer writing a sacred piece for the sheer joy of it if the urge struck them - no doubt this happened on occasion. But for the most part, composers had to make a living just like anyone else and didn\u2019t have time to spare writing music that would not bring in some income. ",
