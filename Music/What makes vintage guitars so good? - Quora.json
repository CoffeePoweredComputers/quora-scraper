            "answer_text": "it\u2019s easy to end up with a pile of good guitars when you start with tens of millions of guitars and throw away every guitar that is even remotely bad. What you see with vintage guitars is a prime example of what I call The Great Filter of Time. Vintage guitars have been through it, and modern guitars haven\u2019t, not yet. The term statisticians use for it is survivorship bias. Basically, the only \u201cvintage\u201d guitars you usually see around nowadays have survived the long journeys to the present day unscathed because they were worth keeping around-the ones that looked, played, and sounded their absolute best. Everything else that wasn\u2019t that good was thrown away long ago. You do not often see examples of the vast oceans of guitars from the same era that were not that good. Nearly all of them that weren\u2019t condemned to landfills ended up nailed to restaurant walls as \u201cpieces of flair\u201d. On the rare occasion that you do get a chance to play one that is functional, you quickly find out why they did not survive. Their necks are uncomfortable, their fretwork is bad and often uneven, their pickups sound weak and thin, and their bridges often do not intonate precisely. Compared with modern guitars in terms of sound and playability, the new ones absolutely destroy the vast majority of old guitars. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, honestly, they don\u2019t - not as a hard and fast rule. I\u2019ve played what are now called vintage guitars before they were vintage, and some were dogs. Horrible little things. And here\u2019s a secret that people need to know: not all humbucking pickups from the 1950s and early 1960s were awesome. There were some real anemic sounding hbs that came off the line at Gibson. Not a lot, but they were out there, and are still. There is a lot of \u201cvintage MUST be better\u201d because, blah blah blah\u2026 Not in my 54 years of playing guitar, and a lot of the guitars I used to own would now be considered vintage. I had a couple dogs, got rid of them. One was a 1966 Stratocaster. The neck was awful and the sound was just so-so. Nothing to write home about. Another was a late 1950s Les Paul double cut, the TV model. It had been gutted and routed for humbuckings. That guitar was a trade, I think. But after playing it for a while, I let it go because it just didn\u2019t work on so many levels, pickups aside. And then there\u2019s the guitars I played but never owned, some in stores, some owned by friends, which are now considered vintage. A few were great, a few were okay, and a few were\u2026.ugh\u2026 Do not buy the hype that vintage automatically means \u201cbetter\u201d. You have to make that assessment on a guitar by guitar basis, literally every guitar being its own testimony to great or awful, or somewhere in between. And THAT is a very subjective assessment at the end of the day. You may say, \u201cWow, this is fantastic!\u201d, whereas I may play the same guitar and think, \u201cWow, not what I was hoping for, not even close.\u201d ",
