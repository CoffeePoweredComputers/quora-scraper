            "answer_text": "Yes. The current mayor of Boston is Marty Walsh, a first-generation Irish American. Many institutions in Boston retained Irish influences like Boston Celtics and Boston College, and the most obvious Irish influence in Boston is the Kennedy family. According to the 2012\u20132016 American Community Survey, the Irish constituted 21% of Massachusetts, which makes them the biggest ethnic group in Massachusetts. During the Celtic Tiger, many Irish people bought buildings in New York to Boston.[1] [2] [3] On a personal note, I visited Boston a few times. During those visits, I represented New York at the CYC (Continental Youth Championships) which is the biggest tournament of Gaelic Sports outside of Ireland. The CYC is rotated with several North American cities like Boston, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Toronto, and Ottawa. From my experience, the city has strong Irish American roots, and they would mention it on their tours.

            "answer_text": "Boston has maintained a lot of strong Irish influences. There are many living Irish here who have immigrated from Ireland and many more who are the descendants of those from earlier generations. It would have been common for those who had \u201ccome out\u201d to send money home for years and to visit home if they had the means. Over the years, many institutions evolved to support the burgeoning immigrant population. Boston College in particular has become an important sponsor of Irish studies and culture, with an important Irish library collection, guest scholars devoted to the study of the Irish history and literature, and a presence in Dublin. Harvard hosted Irish Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney as a visiting professor at Harvard beginning in 1979, as the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory from 1984 to 1995, and as the Ralph Waldo Emerson Poet in Residence, a position he held until 2006. Boston\u2019s current mayor spent a great deal of time in his youth in Galway, his father\u2019s home, and is an Irish speaker. One could go on about the political culture that still owes much to the Irish, from the Kennedy\u2019s to the McCormack\u2019s (Speaker of the U.S. House) to the O\u2019Neil\u2019s (same). I\u2019m sure others could add to the list. ",
