You didn\u2019t say you had trouble fingering the G chord, you said it doesn\u2019t sound right. The reason G chords often sound off (see? alliteration! And I didn\u2019t even do it on purpose) is that you\u2019re playing two Gs that are the same pitch, and they\u2019re out of tune with each other. As a reminder to you (but really for the ukulele-curious folks reading this, if any) the uke is tuned g-C-e-a and so the third fret on the e string should be exactly the same as the first g. A lot of the time, it\u2019s a bit off. The simple solution is to check the two notes and make sure they\u2019re the same. There is another tuning issue you could have, not quite as noticeable, which is that the C string is a bit off. That means the D note in the G chord (second fret, for our viewers) is not quite where it should be and that ringing g-D-g is a bit muddy. It\u2019s good to check the C string against the high c on the a string. Because the ukulele is in a treble instrument, tuning issues are a lot more obvious than with the guitar. When it\u2019s in tune it rings, but if it\u2019s a bit off, the chords just kinda lie there. To make things easy, I recommend using a clip on tuner. You don\u2019t need one of those expensive ones, a cheap small one will do. I bought a pack of six for about $20 on Amazon, and they\u2019re great (I have a lot of ukes). Anyway, the critical thing is check to make making sure the unisons and octaves are in tune. Oh, I almost forgot: There once was a fellow who daily Would strum on his old ukulele He did wonderful things When he plucked on the strings And others compared to him, palely ",

            "answer_text": "Of the chords presented to a beginning ukulele player as \u201clearn this first,\u201d G is probably hardest, arguably harder than the corresponding chord (D) on a guitar. You have three fingers close together on the fretboard, trying to each hold down one string AND NOT TOUCH ANY OF THE OTHERS. If your other chords sound ok, then this is probably your problem. There is a bit of a cheat for this. Instead of using 3 fingers, use 2, laying the index finger across the c,e,a strings, at the 2nd fret, holding them all down firmly, and then using the middle finger tip (well curved, to not touch any other string) on the e string at the 3rd fret. You might find that easier. ",
