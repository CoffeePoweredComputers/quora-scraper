            "answer_text": "I am assuming you mean non famous people like myself. Just to correct you musicians don't really sell songs songwriters do. So just happen to be musicians. It is extremely difficult to sell a song unless you are well connected. There are various websites you can go on. If you just have a song that hasn't been recorded it makes it nearly impossible to sell. I record at least the instrumental tracks and some songs I record the whole song complete with lyrics. If I want to sell like a single I list it on sites like Reverb Nation but if I am trying to sell it for use on TV, commercials or a movie the I upload it to a site like Music Gateway I also have it on the site if I want to sell it to an A&R firm so they can have another artist record their version. It is d and not generally a good way to make a lot of money. ",
