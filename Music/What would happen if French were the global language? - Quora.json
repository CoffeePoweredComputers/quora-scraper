            "answer_text": "For a language to become a global language, it must not be overly regulated and must be allowed to evolve in each region, with unique accents and manners of speech. French is doomed not to become a world language because it is overly regulated. French speakers are often assumed to be thoroughly educated in it. This creates an unrealistic expectation that French is the language of the literati or cultured individuals. This is true: French people often pride their language as the royalty\u2019s tongue. Yes, Latin was once the language of the high society too. But it soon died afterward. Living languages belong always to ordinary folks. Le Fran\u00e7ais\u2019 unwillingness to accept foreign influences on itself has rendered the French language a fragile edifice. The French language has not evolved for hundreds of years. You thus get a language that tends to break when you try to bend it. For most people, learning French is not fun because everything is way too serious. The grammar is serious, pronunciation is serious; nothing is forgiving or lightheartedness. Many among the french have even confessed: why speak good French when you can speak bad English? The linguistic poverty of the French language is aggravated by the fact that France rejects and dismisses the importance of regional dialects and usages. Whereas every English speaking country has their own dialect(s). Even within the UK, you have probably over a dozen dialects. Some of these are very charming and fascinating (like the Scottish and Irish dialects); while some of it are difficult to understand \u2014 such as the Scottish Glaswegian dialect. But there is no comparable intellectual charms to be experienced in the land where French is spoken. Weird accents and uncommon grammatical usage are ridiculed. Until recently France (and its linguists) has had no interest in other dialects (i.e. the cajun french) of French spoken around the world. They think these bastard tongues do not deserve attention. One of the reasons French has declined as a world language is because the speaking populations in the colonies were neglected and marginalized. English is extremely successful because people in the colonies, even non-white colonies, are allowed to speak in a way they are comfortable with. Linguists in America had studied and documented various dialects of cajun French spoken in the former French communities, such as Louisiana, at least a hundred years before French linguists started to turn their attention to these forgotten dialects (in the 1970s). By then it was too late: there was almost no French speakers left in the US. The same is true in the Indochina, no one speaks French there anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "The vocabulary in science and computer sciences would be very different. In French, we don\u2019t like to accept popular and context-dependent words into terminology. For science, we would just have even more greco-latin. The programmation codes would use a basic French lexicon. For fun, I \u201ctranslated\u201d the beginning of the HTML code of this page : <!TYPEDOC lbh><lbh lang=\"fr\"><t\u00eate><lien rel='ic\u00f4ne' refh='https://qsf.ec.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favic\u00f4ne.ico-26-3f34badcb59c8f6c.ico' /><lien rel='pr\u00e9chargement' \u00e9tant='police' type='police/woff2'\u00a0HTML, assuming we would have named it from the same ideas, would be LBH (langage de balisage d\u2019hypertexte) in French. Note we never say that in real life. I\u2019m quite sure not even the OQLF would dare to suggest an alternative in French for this acronym. Internet would probably be MUCH friendlier for expanded Latin alphabet and perhaps any other script (trough Unicode). It\u2019s possible the standard of the most basic text in French on computers would not be in ASCII but in UTF-8. Probably diacritics in Latin would be supported even in the most basic text a computer would produce. Probably it wouldn\u2019t be called Internet, but something like le R\u00e9seau or la Toile (which is used in French), if the idea of a spider web also occurred to us.      The United States would definitly use the International system of measurement, often called metric. We would never tolerate their barbaric units. Wait, did I say the United States ? If French was the global language, it would probably not exist, and be New France instead or some other name if it got independent (we would never have chosen the name Qu\u00e9bec on our own, sorry Europa Universalis IV). Movies would be in French subtitled in most countries, and dubbed in the luckiest. Cannes would be as huge as the Academy Awards are now. I don\u2019t mean that Cannes is not a huge event of course, but\u2026 I guess you see what I mean. The common saying would not be \u201cHouston, we have a problem!\u201d but \u00ab Kourou, on a un probl\u00e8me ! \u00bb. You wouldn\u2019t go to the \u201cstock exchange\u201d but to the Bourse, and it wouldn\u2019t be stocks but actions. You wouldn\u2019t study economics in the London School of Economics but in the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales de Paris. It wouldn\u2019t be Cambridge, but the glorious Sorbonne. Instead of Harvard\u2026 well it\u2019s hard because there were no real universities in New France, but it would be some descendent of the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec. Perhaps it would still be called l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval since the founder wouldn\u2019t change. We would probably not have invented fast food, or not in the same way. It would have been done in a different way because the tastes would not have been the same. Jambon beurre would be served in any fast food joint and maple syrup would be a household product everywhere in the world. Britton galette-saucisse would be the alternate hot-dog. Renault, Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot would be hegemonic for cars in America. The vocabulary for cars would be :  You would write your numbers 1 234,56 instead of 1,234.56 and money would be 5,00 $ instead of $ 5.00 . The week would start monday. You would never see AM (ante meridiem) or PM (post meridiem) because time would be in 24h format. There would never be BC (before Christ) and AD (anno domini). It would\u2026 we would just use relative numbers altogether, so minus and plus. In mathematics, some things would be written differently. For example, you wouldn\u2019t write [math]tan(\\theta)[/math] but [math]tg(\\theta)[/math] because that\u2019s how it\u2019s done in France (not in Qu\u00e9bec).The symbol for division would be more : and less \u00f7, because this last symbol is less popular in France (does not apply to Qu\u00e9bec as usual).Trade mark would not be \u2122 (trade mark) but MD (marque d\u00e9pos\u00e9e). In fact, Qu\u00e9bec has a MD character in Unicode, but since it doesn\u2019t display on my Windows, I assume it wouldn\u2019t on yours either. On a Mac you would probably see the character: \ud83c\udd6b. The music you would hear in the radio would be in French because that would be the language of prestige that people would think sounds cool. People would assume it\u2019s cool because of some intrinsinct qualities and not mere political power. If fact, you would be forced to have quotas to have any content in your languages at all because if you allowed your people to do what they lean to, music in other languages would simply disappear. As for weapons\u2026  Edit : You would ask questions like this on Quora all the time : How can I create an English environment for my baby if I am in a non-English Country (China)? ",
