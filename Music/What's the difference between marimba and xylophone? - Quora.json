            "answer_text": "These two are often confused, for obvious reasons because they look very similar! In fact, the technical difference between them is in the tuning of the bars: A plucked string vibrates in several different modes at different frequencies, producing many partials of the sound that is heard. If the fundamental note has frequency F, the higher partials have frequencies 2F, 3F, 4F, and so on. In musical terms, these correspond to the octave, twelfth, double octave, and so on. We hear the combination of those partials as a single note. A rectangular bar struck with a mallet behaves somewhat differently (if you're interested in the physics of why that is, ask me in the comments and I can explain further). The higher partials do not have such a neat frequency relationship with the fundamental. This is why any old piece of wood doesn't sound particularly musical or pitched. If you look at the underneath of a xylophone bar, you'll see that the wood has been cut/sanded away in the centre of the bar. By doing this, the maker can tune the second partial to exactly twice the fundamental frequency. Now the fundamental and the octave are in tune, and the bar has a more definite pitch. On a marimba, this is taken even further. By carefully shaping the shoulders of the central cutout, higher partials can be tuned as well - on modern instruments, the third and fourth partials (the twelfth and double octave) are tuned. This gives a marimba bar an even more defined pitch and a more 'musical' sound. The differences in playing style stem from - and are accentuated by - these tuning differences. A xylophone is typically played using hard rubber or wooden mallets which excite high frequency modes and produce plenty of the higher partials. Remember that these aren't tuned, so the xylophone has a percussive sound with a pitch which isn't very well defined. A marimba is typically played using soft, yarn-wound mallets. These damp high frequency modes of vibration and bring out the lower partials, giving the marimba a much more musical and centred pitch. With it's more toneful, warmer sound, the marimba began to find new applications, including as a solo instrument. Players and composers began to extend the range, leading to 4.3 and 5 octave instruments. With this extension, the bars themselves got larger and the resonators increased in length to match the lower frequencies - hence the differences in appearance remarked upon by Pedro in his answer. (In recent years, some makers of 'xylophones' have started to tune the third partials of their instruments, so that the above is less true than it used to be. Many players don't like this, because they feel that the real xylophone sound is being lost.) ",

            "answer_text": "I apologize, but this is a rather vague question. There are many different ways the instruments vary - cost, size, weight, materials, appropriate mallets, orchestration, range, durability, genres in which they appear, etc. I am going to make a bold assumption and assume that you are asking the question: \"I am interested in playing mallet percussion and am curious about how the experience will differ between learning to play xylophone and marimba.\" Marimba tends to have heavier mallet heads. The physical left-to-right span of the marimba is larger, so you are covering more ground. It is much more common to have 4, 5, 6, and 6+ mallet marimba pieces than xylophone. 99% of the xylophone music I have played is 2 mallet only. The good news is that, intellectually, they are identical; they are both keyboard-type instruments. Any knowledge you gain on one (that isn't muscle memory) translates to the other. A marimba's sound will feel more \"meaty\" - more bass-heavy. To me, playing marimba is a bit more satisfying physically. The xylophone requires a somewhat more delicate touch. The individual notes / keys are also wider on the marimba, so there is theoretically more physical margin of error for beginners. Stylistically speaking, I find the marimba to be a bit more flexible. Just now I could envision 5 different styles / samples of music with marimba in it playing through my head. I can think of only one style for xylophone right now, which is a symphonic / Broadway musical style. If you are a serious percussionist, you owe it to yourself to spend quality time on both instruments. The physical requirements and technique are different enough that they should be approached with separate and individualized practice regiments. And if you're REALLY serious, you should own both. (But then we're probably talking 10+ grand, if not 15.)  ",
