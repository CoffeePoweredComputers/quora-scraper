            "answer_text": "Interesting question. There's no reason they couldn't be the same, and no reason they must be. While the Harmonium is pretty standardized, \u201cflute\u201d is really more a class of instruments than any particular instrument. In the West, the word usually refers to the Western concert flute. This is a chromatic instrument, like the Harmonium, and therefore ideally notes played on it have the same pitches as notes played on a Harmonium. In India, when you talk about \u201cthe flute\u201d, you're more often than not talking either about a Bansuri or a \u201cVenu\u201d. Then there are native American flutes and Arabian flutes and Chinese flutes - and, I'm sure, others. Ocarinas are technically flutes. Many kinds of indigenous flutes, including Indian classical flutes, are diatonic instruments. This means, essentially, that they are tuned to be able to play one particular scale in one particular key - often a natural major scale. You can, of course, also play in modes of this scale. These flutes may not even be tuned to any specific absolute pitch - in which case it is unlikely that any of the notes (played with each hole either fully open or fully closed) would be the same as any of the notes on a harmonium. Moreover, even if the flute is tuned such that the tonic is a standard note (off the piano keyboard, for example), the flute may be tuned to just intonation, such as (at least North) Indian instruments traditionally are, as opposed to equal temperament, which is what the harmonium and other chromatic instruments use. If this is the case, then ideally each note on the flute will have an equivalent note on the harmonium, but the frequencies will be very slightly different. ",
