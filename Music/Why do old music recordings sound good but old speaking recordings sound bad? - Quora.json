            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, most old music recordings were done in professional studios designed for that purpose, and old speech recordings were usually done live, in venues that were not designed for recording. The recording equipment would have been rudimentary in comparison (probably a tape recorder or a portable disc/cylinder recorder if we are talking very old recordings.) The equipment would often have been located some distance away from the speaker, and often would not have been connected through a soundboard, as would be done today. This kind of recording simply can\u2019t compare to what could be achieved in a studio. In terms of very old recordings (pre 1930 or so), There was less difference in how they were recorded, and more difference in how the equipment was suited for the purpose. Speech recordings back then often WERE done in the same studios where music recordings were made, as there was not really any practical portable equipment, so extremely important speakers would be invited to make recordings. However, those early recording devices were best suited for loud, deep sounds - not so much for common speech. If you listen to old popular songs from the 1910s and 1920s, you\u2019ll notice that the singers may seem to be shouting. That\u2019s because they are in fact shouting their lyrics down a horn similar to that of a gramophone, into the machine that is cutting the master disc right in front of them. This worked well enough for music but wasn\u2019t very good for simple speech, but it was the best thing available. With the advent of better recording technology in the late 20s and early 30s, that kind of singing went out of fashion and speech recording technology got better, though it was still not comparable to what can be done today.

            "answer_text": "Easy. Musical recognition is based on the musical notes, which are essentially constant frequencies. The study of such frequencies is part of musical studies, and it suffices to understand that all occidental music makes use of 12 discrete frequencies (of which 440 Hz, of International Standard Pitch fame is one), and multiples or submultiples of those 12 discrete frequencies. For common people, those frequencies are known as NOTES. Note recognition comes early in life, and after a few years of music listening, it is a natural condition of civilized society. It is only necessary to hint at a musical note for the brain to \u201cadjust\u201d it as a musical tone. Melodies and harmonies are succesions and \u201cblocks\u201d of diverse frequencies, and they form what we know as MUSIC. An early recording is enough to bring to mind a melody, with satisfaction. Early recording systems were, quite naturally, very primitive, and they do not reproduce the aural spectrum in a faithful way. The extremes of the hearable range are not recorded, and although the small portion of it which does get recorded and reproduced suffices to somehow remind the hearer of a certain melody or tune, and even sometimes recognize the instrument producing such melody, or the voice singing the tune, many characteristics of human speech are not reproduced properly. Most important is the sound of the letter \u201cs\u201d. Early recordings simply erase it. Any language lacking the \u201cs\u201d sound becomes quite difficult to understand. The difference between \u201ct\u201d and \u201cd\u201d is also marred, as are the sounds B, V, N, M and C. In fact, only the vowels are easily recognized. Training in listening to early recordings aids towards the enjoyment of such records, and the high background noise of old records does nothing to help. If you have an old recording you want to underestand, listen to it on as many different apparatus as you possibly can. You will discover that playback of early records through \u201cgood\u201d or even excellent gear gives poorer results aurally than listening to them through limited fidelity gear. In many instances, a cell phone or laptop can do wonders towards making early recordings very clear to be understood. In early days of recording it was admitted that Edison recordings made the meaning clear, but the voice of the speaker was not easily recognizable whereas Berliner recordings made it very easy to know who had made the recording, but it was difficult to understand what the speaker had said. Male voices recorded better than female ones, and some languages are easier to understand than others. ",
