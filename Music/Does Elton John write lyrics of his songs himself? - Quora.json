            "answer_text": "Elton John primarily writes the music having been given the lyrics by a songwriting partner, which obviously has most usually been Bernie Taupin. However, Elton does alter the words a little to fit his rhythmic flow - cuts out words here, repeats a line there, or asks his songwriting partner to add another section or couplet etc.  So it wouldn't be fair to say he has no input on the lyrical side. There are also some songs where Elton wrote a significant chunk of the lyrics himself, if not all of them.  I'm not sure it's ever been officially commented on (and the songwriting credits do not reflect it), but for example Elton supposedly wrote some or most of the lyrics of Sorry Seems to be The Hardest Word, Don't Go Breaking My Heart, and the fadeout refrain of Song for Guy. Note: I have not sourced the above views, which come from having listened to countless interviews he (and Bernie) have given, and/or magazine articles and biographies.   I would not be able to provide references without significant effort. ",

On the 1969 recording or \u2018Border Song\u2019, Elton wrote the lyric to the last verse because he felt the song needed one more verse.  \"Border Song\" Holy Moses I have been removedI have seen the specter he has been here tooDistant cousin from down the lineBrand of people who ain't my kindHoly Moses I have been removed Holy Moses I have been deceivedNow the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leaveWon't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of teaHoly Moses I have been deceived I'm going back to the borderWhere my affairs, my affairs ain't abusedI can't take any more bad waterI've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes Holy Moses I have been deceivedHoly Moses let us live in peaceLet us strive to find a way to make all hatred ceaseThere's a man over there what's his color I don't careHe's my brother let us live in peaceHe's my brother let us live in peaceHe's my brother let us live in peace ",
