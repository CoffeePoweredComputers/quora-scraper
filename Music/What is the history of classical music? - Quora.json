            "answer_text": "Western classical music can be divided into historical style periods. This is always a simplification. There is no clear consensus about when one period starts and another ends, there are overlaps. However it's a good starting schedule. Most books on classical music history use periods more or less like this: ...-500: Ancient HistoryOnly a few musical fragments survive from this period, and nobody knows what this music really sounded like. There are however some important books on music theory. Pythagoras discovered numerical ratios in the harmonic overtone series. Ptolemy and Boethius described the early tone system that was based on scales of tetrachords. 500-1400: Middle AgesGregorian chant, named after Pope St. Gregory the Great, were monophonic songs on Latin liturgical texts used in the Catholic Church. They were sung in the Latin mass and in the convents. Byzantine chant was its Eastern European counterpart. After 1100 there was a rise of secular monophonic music. The troubadours in southern France, the trouv\u00e8res in northern France and the Minnes\u00e4nger in Germany wrote wrote melodies to their poems of courtly love. Polyphonic music started in the late 12th century when the composers L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin in the Notre Dame School in Paris added a second voice to a Gregorian melody. The result was the organum. This period, mainly the thirteenth century, is called the Ars Antiqua. The polyphonic style was developed further during the 14th century. Guillaume de Machaut's Messe de Nostre Dame was the first complete setting of a mass by a single composer. This period is called the Ars Nova. 1400-1600: RenaissanceThis period was dominated by religious polyphonic music. The Latin mass and the motet were the most important genres. Dutch composers were Josquin des Prez and Orlande de Lassus. Italians were G. P. da Palestrina and Giovanni Gabrieli. Secular music was written in a lighter style. In the 16th century instrumental music started to blossom. 1600-1750: BaroqueThe monody was a new style developed in Italy: one vocal melody with instrumental accompaniment. This coincided with the rise of new genres: opera and cantata. The basso continuo is the most typical style element of the Baroque: a figured bass line with numbers under it, indicating the chords on the harpsichord or other chordal  instruments. Important composers in the 18th century were Monteverdi and Purcell. In the late Baroque J. S. Bach combined the old polyphonic with the new monophonic style. G. F. Handel wrote a lot of operas and oratorios, Antonio Vivaldi wrote his concertos. 1750-1800: Classicism In this period the basso continuo gradually disappeared. The classical orchestra took shape. Joseph Haydn created the standard genres and forms that would be followed by composers for over a century: the symphony, the string quartet, the piano sonata. W. A. Mozart's instrumental music is stylistically close to Haydn's, but he also wrote operas in German and Italian style. The early Beethoven belongs to this period as well. 1800-1910: RomanticismDuring Early Romanticism (1800-1830) Beethoven added personal expression to the classical genres when he wrote his masterpieces. Franz Schubert wrote songs (Lieder) with piano accompaniment that expressed a sense of unfulfilled longing and a preoccupation with death.  During High Romanticism (1830-1890) the symphonic orchestra was expanded. Important composers of symphonic and chamber music were Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms. Chopin and Liszt created a virtuoso piano style. Richard Wagner wrote heroic operas in a new chromatic style. Giuseppe Verdi was the pride of the Italian opera. Other countries developed their own national style: Russia (Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov), Bohemia (Dvorak), Norway (Grieg) and Spain (De Falla). Late Romanticism (1890-1910) saw a further expansion of the orchestral song and the symphony by Gustav Mahler, the symphonic poem by Richard Strauss, the piano concerto by Rachmaninoff and the opera by Puccini. In France there was a countermovement with Debussy's impressionism. Erik Satie was a precursor of minimalism. 1910-1970: Modernism and NeoclassicismArnold Schoenberg broke with traditional harmony when he started writing atonal music and invented his twelve-tone technique. His pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern followed suit. Igor Stravinsky used irregular, hammering rhythms in his ballet The Rite of Spring. After 1920 he turned to a neoclassical style, combining style elements of older composers with new, anti-romantic ideas. Bela Bart\u00f3k found inspiration in the folk music of Hungary. Other composers who found their way to the concert hall were Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten and Heitor Villa-Lobos.  Radical modernist composers of the next generations were Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. Integral serialism was a mathematical approach to composing. Aleatoric music on the contrary incorporated a chance element. There was a countermovement in the United States with the indeterminate music of John Cage and the rise of minimalism. 1970-... Postmodernism: This period - if it exists - is the hardest to define. The central idea - if there is one - is that the cerebral logic of modernism was a dead end street. Postmodernists are open to irony and contradictions. Alfred Schnittke wrote polystylistic music, juxtaposing styles of different eras in one composition. Other composers combine classical music with jazz, rock or world music. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not entirely sure what answer you are expecting bu I\u2019ll offer my thoughts. It may well be that others can do much better. It is necessary to define a start point for classical music and, more, to define what is actually meant by the term. One person\u2019s classical music is Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and this is the period of the enlightenment. Another person will consider the music written during the romantic period to be classical. I\u2019d prefer not to assign dates or periods in time to music, at least not the music of the last couple of centuries. I don\u2019t see the need. Delius, one of my favourite composers, began composing in the 19th century (the time ascribed to the romantics) and wrote well into the 20th century, dying in 1934. Yet, is it fair to class his music as \u2018romantic\u2019? In some cases and to some extent, yes; but his was a unique voice, in much the same way as was the voice of Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arnold Bax. Therefore I prefer to think of classical music as a broad span of musical styles, from operatic to ballet to symphony to choral work, even to certain film scores that present a quality that rivals that of (predominantly) the romantic composers in its depth and feeling. Would you class any of John Barry\u2019s musical scores as classical? There\u2019s a fine line at times and this composer has a unique voice. What about George Gershwin? His opera score for Porgy and Bess and his rhapsody in Blue must surely rank as high calibre classical music, regardless of the time period when they were written. ",
