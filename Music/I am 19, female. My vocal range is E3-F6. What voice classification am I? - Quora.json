            "answer_text": "This probably depends on where you think you sound the best! If it\u2019s in your low/middle range, you are most likely a mezzo soprano and if it\u2019s in your high range, you\u2019re most likely a soprano. Also, which notes come with ease? For me, I have greater difficulty hitting a Bb5 than F3\u2026. So while I can hit \u201cboth\u201d, the fact that I have an easier time navigating my lower range indicates that I\u2019m a mezzo soprano! Finally, when I was younger, I was convinced I had a range of C3-C6\u2026. This was not the case, because I\u2026 well\u2026 couldn\u2019t sing that range at all. So maybe something \u201chas to give\u201d whether it\u2019s in your high or low register. For me, it was kinda both; as of now, I have a range of approx F#3-B5, but I\u2019m working on my strengthening my high notes. I hope this helps, and if that is indeed your true range, it\u2019s quite a remarkable one! ",
