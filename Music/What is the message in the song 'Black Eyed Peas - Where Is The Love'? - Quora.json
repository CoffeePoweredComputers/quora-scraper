            "answer_text": "The message in the song, \u201cWhere is the Love,\u201d by the Black Eyed Peas, is whatever you choose it to be. It was written by a flock of songwriters, each with his own interpretation\u2014will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Justin Timberlake, Printz Board, Michael Fratantuno and George Pajon. Wikipedia (not the bastion of truth the world thinks that it is) claims that the song laments worldwide problems, including terrorism, the U.S. government, hypocrisy, racism, gang crime, pollution, war, and intolerance. Below is my interpretation of the song, using some of its lyrics, interspersed with my own thoughts (WARNING: MY THOUGHTS ARE THE THOUGHTS OF A DAMAGED BRAIN). What's wrong with the world? We\u2019ve forgotten our advanced human mothers, who created us in a world of peace, where everyone was humane to everyone else. Our lives are filled with drama and trauma. We claim to fight terrorism; but we are terrorists ourselves. We live in a land (the USA) filled with discrimination and prejudice and hate. Our minds are out-of-control, and love is not the answer. What we love we hate; what we hate, we kill. We\u2019ve given up our humanity, and we don\u2019t understand the true golden rule\u2014the treat others like THEY want to be treated. We pray to God for help; but we are just praying to ourselves. We kill people with bombs and chemical weapons; and then we claim to desire to make America \u201cgreat again,\u201d when it was never great to begin with. We don\u2019t seek the Real Truth\u2014about who we are and why we exist\u2014because we don\u2019t care. We worship the Mighty Dollar, not realizing that the love of money is the root of all evil. We\u2019ve lost our humanity, collectively, as a mortal human race. We fear a One World Government that could save us\u2014by eliminating poverty and child prostitution. We rely on religion instead, waiting for the god of this world to set up his One World Government instead. Yes, something is wrong with the world.  ",

            "answer_text": " The message is about love and peace. Where with love and peace the world will be safe. There is no hunger, let alone those who do evil and hurt one human to another. If there is no peace and love in this world people will be able to kill and hurt each other. Its So Bad. ",
