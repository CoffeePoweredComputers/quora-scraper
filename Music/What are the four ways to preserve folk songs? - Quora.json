            "answer_text": "I doubt that this is a definitive list, but: Pass them on. Make sure others learn them and sing them to others. This is, after all, the ultimate reason for folk songs.Adapt them. Not too much different to the above, but updating folk songs to reflect more modern happenings can help to keep the tunes and the general message within the song alive.Write the down in a manner that can be used by future generations - e.g common musical notation; easily read text. The resulting book should then be published to ensure that a few copies are dispersed around - and if properly published with an ISBN number, a copy will b held by the British Library at least.Record them. Again, this needs to be in some long-term electronic format. For the moment, I\u2019d say that standard mpg would do, but more clear and modern less lossy formats such as FLAC could also work.I\u2019d say that the preferred one is to pass on the original as best as possible. However, much folk did have at least the music updated to reflect different times: the approach of e.g. Steeleye Span of taking very old folk songs and adding electric guitars and complex drums as well as fiddle solos shows how successful this can be.

            "answer_text": "Off the top of my head, I can think of three ways: Pass them along from teacher to learner(s), in person, by ear (aka the aural/oral tradition)Write the lyrics and music down. The music can be written using standard music notation or some system of tabs, be they guitar tab, banjo tab, mandolin tab, or what-have-you. Most tablature transcriptions, however, don\u2019t do a very good job of conveying the rhythms and phrasing of the music, note durations and so forth, requiring the learner to already have a pretty good idea of how the tune should sound in order to play the tab accurately.Record the song in some fashion. Thomas Edison revolutionized the world of music forever by inventing the phonograph in the late 1800\u2019s, thereby making it possible for the first time to record and preserve sound for future listening.",
