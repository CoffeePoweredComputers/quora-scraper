            "answer_text": "You're talking about Harry Nilsson. One of the most underrated singer, songwriter and composer of his generation. Once, Dick Cavet interviewed The Beatles and asked each of them what the were listening to. Each in turn responded \u2018'Harry Nilsson\u2019\u2019. He was pals with Lennon and Mickey Dolan. As far as I'm aware, there are no other songs really like \u2018'The Coconut Song\u2019. Nilsson\u2019s work is amazing. Highly recommend \u2018Nilsson Schmilsson\u2019, which is his greatest hits recording. There is also a box set. The documentary about his life was also amazing. He died about 10 years ago after a very hard life. ",
