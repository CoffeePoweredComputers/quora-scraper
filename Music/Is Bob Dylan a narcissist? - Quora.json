            "answer_text": "To my understanding, a narcissist has a heightened self of their own self worth, a pathological need to be admired, adored and noticed and struggles to empathise with anyone else. That doesn\u2019t sound like Dylan at all. In fact it\u2019s almost the opposite of the way he behaves. It\u2019s difficult to judge anyone\u2019s empathy because empathy is so easy to fake. It\u2019s easy to think Bob was empathetic because we can see clear empathy in his songs but he saw himself as part of a tradition of folk music which detailed the plight of those less fortunate. He listened to empathy, sang other people\u2019s empathetic songs and could easily have faked empathy if he felt like it. Dylan didn\u2019t have a heightened sense of his own self worth and actually got annoyed when others did. He hated being called \u201cThe Spokesman for his generation\u201d and arced up if anyone used the title. He\u2019s famous for saying he was \u201cjust a song and dance man\u201d and downplaying the importance of his music. He\u2019s always been honest about his own limited musical ability and acknowledged that he\u2019s an adequate guitarist, pianist and harmonica player. He\u2019s capable of criticizing his own vocals and acknowledging when he borrows a tune from a traditional song. It\u2019s much easier to find evidence of him talking himself down than talking himself up. Dylan definitely doesn\u2019t have a pathological need for attention. If anything he has a pathological desire to avoid it. He performs concerts and releases albums but apart from that he tends to stay out of the public eye whenever possible. He doesn\u2019t do many interviews, even when promoting an album. He politely declines offers to appear on talk shows and other appearances and turns down offers to perform onstage with big names who idolise him. Donald Trump (who is definitely a narcissist) has released 30 books about how wonderful he is. Dylan has released only one non-fiction book in his 50 year career. He rarely appears on his album covers and he even produces his own albums under a pseudonym (Jack Frost). In 2016 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first songwriter to achieve the honour. Instead of making a big deal about it, he went weeks without even discussing it. When he did he said it was a huge honour. He was entitled to go to the ceremony and receive waves of adulation but stayed at home and sent a speech instead. That\u2019s not really the action of someone who craves attention. If you want further evidence then check out any of his acceptance speeches. He\u2019s been given lost of awards in his life and when he does turn up to the ceremony he makes his way to the mic, recites a brief list of people he wants to thank and then rushes off. If he was a narcissist then he would adore the attention and use it to promote his own importance, Dylan is more interested in showing gratitude and then getting out of there. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and his acceptance speech went for just over a minute and was basically a list of thankyous. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers were inducted in 2012 and Flea spoke for three times that length and spoke almost entirely about himself and how great his band was. If you have to tick three boxes to be a narcissist (lack of empathy, attention- seeking, self importance) then you can\u2019t really tick any of them and you can definitely put big crosses next to the last two.

            "answer_text": "Bob Dylan is about the furthest thing from a narcissist. The man avoids interviews at all cost and does not seem to enjoy any attention people give him \u2014 in fact, attention seems to irritate him. I\u2019ve seen him in concert twice. No pleasantries with the audience, no showboating. He goes on stage, does his act, then walks off with little more than a \u201cthank you, good night.\u201d Hardly the behaviour that a narcissist would exhibit. ",
