            "answer_text": "A little background as to where I'm coming from. I'm 64, and was a teenager from 1968 - 1975. It was a very turbulent time with sweeping and significant changes in all aspects of our lives. It was also a time where artists felt a new freedom of expression. Music listeners were not opposed to spending the time to appreciate a thematic record album that might have them digging into a cuts longer than 20 minutes. It wasn't uncommon for a group's work to be very diverse. It didn't have to be the cookie cutter crap forced upon them by producers from their record label. It was no longer necessary to shorten the release to 3\u20134 minutes and maintain a particular style or sound (sound familiar? History repeats). The greatest hits are a good place to start. Most serious music lovers find that what's most popular is often what's most \u201caccessable\u201d. An artist's need to play to the largest audience is often not a reflection of the most significant or meaningful work that they've created. I think you've got to dig deeper to appreciate what an artist has to offer. What is most popular doesn't always resonate with me. I find that YouTube is a great, no cost option to explore whatever artist (with few exceptions) with whom you may have an interest. Happy Listening! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for an intelligent music question! I will use Brian Hyland for my answer. He is an artist that has been around for a long time, nearly sixty years, but he is still putting out great music. So you might think my answer would be chronologically, but I guess in this instance I would have to say more haphazard. I have always loved his song Gypsy Woman, it is from his eponymous 1970 album, so I started there. I got the track listing and listened to every single one of the songs, I created a play list starting with those songs. I joined his fan club and I saw some relatively new music listed there, so I looked up those tracks and added all of those to my play list, too. I love his newer music, much of it has a jazz or bluesy feel to it and is so good. After that I went on a case by case basis, many time YouTube would suggest a song, so I would listen to it and decide if I wanted to add it. I have to admit, I am not crazy about his very early stuff, they were novelty songs from the early 60\u2019s which suited the times but are hopelessly outdated. He has done everything from country flavored (I\u2019m Afraid To Go Home) to rock, pop, blues and jazz. I can\u2019t wait to see what music he still has in him, he is 76 years old but sounds like a man half his age. ",

There is so much when going back to the early stuff. Just like the Beatles\u2026 I find the early stuff so fascinating\u2026 ",
