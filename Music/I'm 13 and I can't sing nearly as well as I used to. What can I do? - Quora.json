            "answer_text": "I don't know if you're male or female (and it's not important information) but whichever you are, during puberty your body changes. This includes your vocal chords.  If you are a boy, your voice will break noticeably and become deeper. If you are a girl, you're voice will also mature and may become deeper. This will obviously affect your singing.  BUT, all is not lost. Puberty doesn't last too long and your body will settle down. Once this happens, you may not have the vocal range that you had as a younger child, but you will discover your new voice can do things your old one couldn't.  And remember, being the best singer is not about hitting the highest notes. The best singers in the world are the ones who can express their music using the range they have in their instrument (their voice). Tone, control and power throughout your range are far more important than what the highest note you can hit is. Good luck and I hope you reestablish your confidence in your singing soon! ",

You should keep at it and believe me in another 3 or 5 yrs. your voice will mature and you will not just be good, but surely a great singer. Continue with your breathing & singing excercises and have warm tea with honey sometimes. Keep good oral hygiene and Do not catch a cold. 12 to 16 years is a very trying time for all teenagers . It's called Puberty. You could use that time fruitfully by learning to play the Classical guitar. See you on You Tube one day, with thousands of followers. ",
