            "answer_text": "Having attended plenty of IU related events as well as the university and still affiliated with some aspects thereof, I would have to say that the biggest misconception is that its automatically a party school. It\u2019s a party school for the people who chose to go out and party and get drunk and either they make the grades or they end up flunking out. Then they have to transfer somewhere else or end up at a lesser state school. The whole idea of it being a party school came about probably about the 1980s or so before I attended there. What I will say is that I know of a straight A high school student that wanted to be a doctor and attended IU. She chose to party instead and eventually no longer ended up pursuing a medical career and ended up flunking herself out as did many other people my age. If you take it seriously and do your coursework, take good notes and learn as much as you can its a terrific school especially for business majors, medical and countless other pursuits. On the other hand if you screw off and party all the time just like any other major college you are going to have some difficulties. Some people can party their asses off on the weekend and do their coursework during the week and be successful. Others have issues with doing the partying which ends up extending into the week and then you are going to have issues with getting coursework done and attending class. Another misconception is that IU is some hick school in Indiana whereas its actually a liberal place in a city that in many ways is a liberal oasis in a state that runs pretty conservative in its politics. Bloomington (the home base of the IU system) is a quite liberal and accepting city for the most part. Of course, there are always outliers such as the fundamentalist nutheads that show up to protest everything from some town south of Bloomington that is predominantly rural and supposedly Christian even though its a fake sort of religiosity that these people practice. Bloomington is also relatively close to Indianapolis so if you need some big city flavor you can always run up to Indianapolis a 50 mile drive one way and get some sort of city experience although Bloomington is a community these days of 80,000 people with 150,000 in the county. Also another thing is that Monroe County and Bloomington both have protections for the LGBTQ community such as ordinances that prohibit discriminatory practices and a generally accepting community for the most part. Rarely do you hear of some sort of bias crime or hate crime minus the occasional nutjob that decides it would be appropriate to attack someone and then of course they end up in jail for being fools. The nice thing about Bloomington is that its also a city that has a lot of nature going for it from Lake Monroe to its proximity to places like Brown County State Park about 20 miles away and Yellowwood State Forest. There is also McCormick\u2019s Creek State Park about 15\u201320 miles NW of Bloomington as well as Lake Monroe. Bloomington has a quite vibrant arts and crafts community as well with a lot of smaller festivals you might not hear about. Not to mention kid friendly for the most part with attractions such as Wonderlab and with proximity to Indianapolis to visit the Children\u2019s Museum, Indianapolis Zoo and other big city amenities. I\u2019ve probably forgotten a few things or someone else can chime in about IU and their experiences there but overall its a great place to get an education if you are properly motivated and have a good attitude towards learning. If you choose not to then by all means its on you not the professors or the university. ",

So why is she so popular? Her personality, her overall outlook appeals to the Korean market mostly. But at the same time \u2192 She has stage presence.When IU performs on that stage, everyone watches her. I think that\u2019s one reason she\u2019s so popular. Because of her good girl image, she looks like an angel. She\u2019s overhyped.Everyone talks about her all the time, but there are more talented and amazing soloists out there. I like IU but it makes me wonder why she gets so much hype.  I could be wrong about this, if i am sorry. I like IU\u2019s relatable personality and all, I just don\u2019t see the hype. I know this is really short so\u2026 ",
