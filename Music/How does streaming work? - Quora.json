            "answer_text": "There are two different things that people call \u201cstreaming\u201d these days. Online radio (which is the actual \u201cstreaming\u201d). On the remote machine a special software (e.g., Icecast, SHOUTcast, ffserver) continuously generates what you can think of as an \u201cinfinite .mp3 file\u201d. You, as a listener, can access that \u201cfile\u201d (= \u201cstream\u201d) using a URL. E.g., this URL \u2013 http://ice1.somafm.com/thetrip-128-mp3 \u2013 gives you a stream of SomaFM\u2019s The Trip channel. So, for you it\u2019s essentially an .mp3 file which is located somewhere remotely, and which you have no control of \u2013 you cannot rewind it back or forward, you can just click \u201cplay\u201d and listen to whatever it is currently playing there. All the listeners who open the same URL will listen to the same music as it\u2019s generated per URL, not per listener.Online streaming service (which we call that way, but what technically might not be 100% correct). This is how Pandora, Spotify, Google Music and all the other similar services work. The remote software sends you (to your client app or a web browser) a URL t a song (an .mp3 file). Your client app downloads and plays that .mp3 file for you, then asks the remote software to provide a link to the next file to download and play. And so forth. Every time when the remote program receives a request for the next song, it can decide which one to provide (taking into account tons of parameters \u2013 user\u2019s location, genre preferences, trending songs, user\u2019s age, etc.) and in most cases it will differ for different users. For example, if you open Tuneself Radio (which is actually not a radio) and click \u201cnext\u201d button a few times, you will get some music, but the songs will be most likely different from those which I get if I do the same at the same time. From the given example, you can also see that in the case of a \u201cstreaming service\u201d, you may have some control of what is playing and how (typically, you can rewind across the currently playing song \u2013 as it\u2019s basically \u201can .mp3 file in your player\u201d \u2013 and advance to the next song).PS I used \u201c.mp3 file\u201d term for simplicity, the actual audio format may be different for both online radio streams and streaming services (not necessarily MP3 per se).
