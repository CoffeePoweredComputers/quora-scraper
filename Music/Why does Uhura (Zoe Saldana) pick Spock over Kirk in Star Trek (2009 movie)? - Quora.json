            "answer_text": "She doesn't \"pick\" Spock over Kirk; as Jesse notes, Kirk was never even in contention. First of all, she's obviously quite put off by his initial approach in the bar, then by his appearance behind her roommate's bed.  While this sort of diametric makes a great start to an \"opposites attract\" movie, it's not usually the case in real life, and really, that outcome has no place in the story being told.   Besides, in such a story, in the time it would take the uptight girl come around and fall for the abrasive but dashing lead, Kirk is already in command of the Enterprise and suddenly Uhura's commanding officer... and as has been discussed elsewhere (Star Trek (creative franchise): As a woman, what is it like to work for Captain James Tiberius Kirk?), the one thing Kirk the Man-Whore has never done is abuse his position of authority over women in his command. All that notwithstanding, it's quite clear that Uhura and Spock have already been in a relationship for some time, possibly since even before Kirk signs up with Starfleet. In either timeline, Uhura doesn't strike me as the type to dump a long-term relationship for a fling with a bad boy. ",
