            "answer_text": "Yes, because they were born here, not because they have more of a right to be called native Americans than the rest of us do. Originally from the Southeast, especially Georgia, they were forced to move to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). They were the most closely assimilated at the time they were forced out of Georgia. They had a written language, lived like their white neighbors, and even owned slaves. Many of them fought for the South in the Civil War. As punishment, Indian Territory was opened to white settlement and allowed to become a state. ",
