            "answer_text": "Hi, This my own interpretation about the song : 1. \"We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes I thought you died alone, a long long time ago\" --   I think that the stairs here represent the life cycle of human (particularly that person) and now as he is well socially connected person, a person with wealth and all the riches he realized that today when he have everything, he has lost his innocence and is not able to realize the real important things in life apart from materialistic thing which he had gained due to the pressure of world around him. 2. \" I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here We must have died along, a long long time ago Who knows? Not me\" -- In these few lines he want to generalize this current situation to his, with world.  He had realized that in the urge to get all materialistic riches he had lost the connection with nature and family. He is thinking that the person who he used to be has died within him in the process of gaining everything which on later life would mean nothing to him. 3. Chorus \"We never lost control You're face to face With the man who sold the world\" -- The chorus starting line should mean that he is fed up with his sophisticated lifestyle and now is talking steps to get connected to the soul of nature by selling off all his wealth which meant world to him right now. Ps: Sorry for bad grammar :P ",
