            "answer_text": "Being comfortable singing between E3 and G4 tells me you either have a vocal organ akin to that needed in order to train and build a tenor voice (and that would quite likely mean some hormonal imbalance and possible health issues for you\u2026) or most likely you are singing awfully low in your range. The fact you can hit an F5 as your highest note is not telling that much since without proper training and technique you might not even be accessing your real High notes, so as far as we know your vocal organ can be anything needed in order to build some kind of low voice such a contralto or maybe a mezzo-soprano or maybe even a lower kind of soprano voice\u2026 who knows? We haven\u2019t even listened to you :) I personally advise everyone posting this kind of question on Quora on quitting chasing answers on the Internet and instead: pay a visit to either a Phoniatrist or an Othorhinolaryngologist being specialised on singers and asking about your vocal foldstake some singing lessions by a known singing teacher experienced on your kind of voice (male voice vs female voice)Hope this helps.

I know that might not be a voice part/type you find in chorus but I don\u2019t really care much. I wish people would be classified as certain voice types based on their anatomy instead of what notes they\u2019re capable of singing. You have your answers. ",
