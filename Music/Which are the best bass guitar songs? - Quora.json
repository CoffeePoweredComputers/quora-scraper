            "answer_text": "Here are a few songs and bands that cross genres/styles of music. I'm staying away from jazz stuff, that can go on for days. Are you just learning bass? Looking to improve? What's up? A must know is any, which means practically every, doo-wop song. Popular circa 1955-1961, the 1\u20136\u20134\u20135 pattern is exemplified, even if not followed strictly, by doo-wop. Some good ones are Two Silhouettes On The Shade, Earth Angel, Duke of Earl, and Under The Boardwalk. That last one is good to know because it IS a different pattern. Listen to anything with bassist Bill Black. He played with Elvis Presley and did solo albums. Great two-count, great walking lines, great bassist. Then listen to the master, James Jamerson. He's on all Motown like Jackson 5 and Marvin Gaye. His bass on Ain't No Mountain High Enough is unsurpassed. The old stuff isn't bad or boring. It's solid, rhythm keeping bass playing. That is the foundation all bass players need to know. More modern: I'm a fan of the band Boston. Learn Foreplay/Longtime. It's not that hard, you can learn it by ear. (Ultimate Guitar Tab app has lots of bass tabs) The Pretenders Mystery Achievement, Go-Go's Head Over Heels, and Pink Floyd Money are very recognizable basslines that are fun to play and hear. Another is Fleetwood Mac The Chain. Also play Grand Funk Railroad Some Kinda Wonderful with Can I Get A Witness. Simplicity CAN get you everywhere! Bassline in Meatloaf Paradise By The Dashboard Light harks back to Fats Domino on the piano. If you can play Rolling Stones Miss You\u2026. the Holy Spirit must be in your fingers!! More advanced than I can play is John Entwistle of The Who, Noel Redding & Billy Cox who both played with Jimi Hendrix, and, of course, Paul McCartney. Did I go too long? I'm sorry, I get carried away. Now get out there and learn some basslines!!! . ",
