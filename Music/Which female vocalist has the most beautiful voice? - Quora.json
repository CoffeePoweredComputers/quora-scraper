            "answer_text": "I think Lara Fabian has the best pure, warm, round, powerful and strain free timbre. Especially in songs like \u201cAdagio\u201d, \u201cJe suis malade\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not from here\u201d and \u201cBroken vow\u201d I find her timbre impossible to improve in beauty. I love also Hiba Tawaji, Karen Carpenter, Emma Shapplin, Madina Amin, Ann Wilson, Judith Durham, Eurielle etc.. These are all rather \u201cclassic\u201d musicians, they don\u2019t have dominant jazzy or gospel influences. The singing of Lara is for me related to Bel Canto in the way that\u2019s about the beauty of the voice first while the lyrics are often not much more than a vehicle for that goal. Some might find it all too sugary or commercial but if you sing yourself you can only admire her timbre and perfect intonation and carrying power and all this almost without any vibrato. I have some issues with her breathing sounds though and her repertoire is not always deep. That Hiba has practically only \u201cgood\u201d or even better songs, recommended !  ",
