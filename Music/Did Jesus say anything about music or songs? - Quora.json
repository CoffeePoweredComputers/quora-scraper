            "answer_text": "No, Jesus never talks about music or songs, but in Matthew 26:30 he and his disciples \"sing a hymn\". Jesus gives music a passing mention in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:25). He hears some music in Matthew 9:23. But he never evaluates it positively or negatively. Elsewhere in the New Testament, Paul recommends singing \"hymns, psalms and spiritual songs\" (Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:19) and in James 5:13 we are told to sing \"songs of praise\" if we are happy. The prevalent belief in Protestantism, Catholicism and Orthodoxy is that music can be good (when it is devoted to God), bad (when it promotes un-Christian messages like violence and devil worship), or neutral (sometimes a song's just a song). In private, you are free to listen to whatever you wish, but you'll know yourself when a type of music makes you feel, for example, violent or lustful, and you should no longer listen to it. ",

            "answer_text": "Two of the Gospels mention the fact that Jesus and His disciples sang a hymn at the end of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30 and Mark 14:26). Elsewhere in the Gospels, music is seen as part of mourning (Matthew 9:23) and celebration (Luke 15:25). Paul gave instructions regarding the use of music during Christian gatherings in Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16.  In Ephesians we see that addressing each other with hymns and songs is  an indication of being Spirit-filled. In Colossians the same is an  indication of being filled with the Word of Christ, and the songs come  \u201cfrom the Spirit.\u201d In James 5:13 we have this command: \u201cIs anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.\u201d  Read more:  Page on gotquestions.org ",

If you've ever attended a Jewish wedding then you know there is plenty of dancing and singing and instruments being played! A wonderful, lively celebration! I want to reason that if Jesus was a complete and total stick in the mud, I'm not sure if He would've even been invited to the wedding. Jesus' mother, Mary, was there also in attendance. If her Son found music or dancing offensive, I think she would've left him home. ",
