            "answer_text": "I've attended Coachella for 12 consecutive years. What people do at Coachella depends on whom you ask. In general, Coachella is predominantly a music festival (started in 1999) with some art installations sprinkled here and there, and over the years, further recreational activities added in. Many of the attendees camp in the lots adjacent to the festival grounds. I'll summarize the demographics I've observed over the years: Music Lovers: There really ought to be no further explanation. In 2006 I showed up to Coachella not knowing what it was, and was blown away by the knowledgeable but unpretentious crowd that flocked from all over the world to these polo fields to catch their favorite bands and artists. Without having to talk to anyone, I felt a special vibe being in that same place and time as everyone else there. This pretty much described the entire population I encountered in 2006. Today in 2017, we're only a fraction of the overall attendees. Scenesters: I'm sure these people always existed, and a decade ago they might've been those guys who wore funny clothes, but today they're pretty much every female in attendance who wears the same Native American flower crown hippie B.S. that's infested the festival grounds. This population shows up to appear cool on their social media accounts. If the weekend gets particularly warm, certain members of this population may not find sufficient motivation to return in the years that follow. Spring Breakers: Speaking of infestation, with the rise of shitty EDM in this country at the start of the decade, a breed of attendees have converted this beloved festival into what many of us veterans call \u201cBrochella\u201d. This population can overlap with the Scenesters, and a lucky few may even convert to Music Lovers, but in general these people tend to enter the festival later in the day, are under the constant influence of substances that I'm not fully knowledgeable on, and very rarely leave the dance tent to catch a set that involves real instruments (unless such a set is Lana Del Rey or the like, in which case they'll rudely push their way to the front of Neutral Milk Hotel\u2019s quiet set and loudly talk amongst themselves while waiting for LDR to come on). Today I consider this demographic to comprise 75% of overall attendees. Celebrities: Celebrities have always attended Coachella, since the festival is just a short drive away from LA, and it was almost commonplace to spot the regulars like Danny De Vito or Paris Hilton flocking among the muggles. Nowadays, every celebrity who has an Instagram account is guaranteed to be at Coachella, some of whom could be paid by certain brands to wear their apparel. Furthermore, in recent years, celebrities increasingly make appearances as surprise guests for some of the performers. Curious Tourists: I'll just use this label to cover everyone else who may tag along with a friend for the first time and have yet to discover their Coachella identity. They may be excited about a band or 2, but are happy to just sample the various parts of Coachella with no expectations. They usually walk out of their first Coachella feeling inspired and energized. Because despite the increasing flaws that have befallen this beloved festival, Coachella is still fun. Clearly I reflect on the changes I've witnessed with a sense of bitterness (I hear that Burning Man has encountered a similar fate), but this nonetheless has not deterred me from returning each year. I'd still highly encourage anyone who may be interested to attend, even though it saddens me that this event is not what it once was. ",
