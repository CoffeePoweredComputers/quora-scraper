            "answer_text": "Can I change guitar tuning during a song? This is for a studio situation, not live. I'm writing a long instrumental, and I would like to have a section in drop C, but another in E standard. Would it be too drastic of a change? Thank you for you answer I saw and heard Christopher Parkening do this exact thing at a classical guitar concert in Seattle many years ago. He was playing an arrangement of Simple Gifts\u2014if I recall correctly\u2014which required him to change keys for the final verse and re-tune his low E string down to C, which he did during the piece with almost no interruption.  So what you propose is at least possible, even if it were a concert situation and not recording. But of course, in a recording situation, there\u2019s nothing to prevent you from doing this as two separate tracks and putting them together. There is one way to down-tune during a song without missing a beat, but this device only allows you to go to drop D from standard low E. It\u2019s called the Hipshot, and it\u2019s used to allow guitar players to retune quickly. It replaces the entire tuning peg on your sixth string (or they make them for bass as well). You just flip the lever and you can toggle between standard tuning and one step lower: Hipshot GT2 Electric Xtender  ",

            "answer_text": "If you wanted to use just one guitar and switch during tunings during the song, the Line 6 Variax range of guitars can do this (I have no affiliation with them but I own one of the models). Check out videos of 12 Foot Ninja demonstrating this on YouTube (\u201c12 Foot Ninja's Stevic MacKay Does the Impossible with JTV\u201d). He is using another piece of tech (Helix) to switch tunings but you can also switch tunings on the guitar itself. The tuning won\u2019t *necessarily* have a drastic change on the piece; that\u2019s really up to your composition. Obviously you\u2019ll reach lower notes in the drop C section and that tuning is most useful for a C tonal centre. I personally use that tuning mainly for playing power chords or chugging riffs rather than open chords but Andy McKee has done some beautiful pieces in drop D. Soundgarden are an oddity in that Kim Thayil usually tuned his guitar to the same tuning as Chris Cornell - in many bands, the lead guitarist might stay in standard or drop D so their favourite lead licks are the same. The weird tunings led to some really interesting leads from Kim so my advice is to not follow any hard rules and to have fun experimenting. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question! As long as you have time built into the song I see no reason why not. You should have either a clip-on tuner or a floor model ready of course. Remember that the time needed to retune would depend on what tuning you wish to go into. A dropped 6th string would be easy and could be done in seconds. A full-out retuning would take at least 30 seconds to a minute. If your guitar has a floating tremolo bridge then you will have a much harder time. In fact, I would advise attempting that during a song. One more thing, it may be best to have a second guitar ready. That may give you the ability to make the quick change you are looking for.

            "answer_text": "I really would not recommend using studio time this way. Far better to switch between guitars, or possibly get yourself a double neck instrument and tune each neck accordingly. It sounds as though you would be using an acoustic guitar for this recording session. Unless you are very much at home in a studio environment you are likely to be nervous, and if you are not also very used to swiching between tunings, your nervousness could really make things difficult. I would certainly recommend at least taking a second guitar with you as a failsafe - either tuned to concert or open C if that is what you intend using. Practice at home first of all, and see how well you are able to quickly retune from E to C and viceversa. If you find it at all difficult, chances are it will be far more difficult in the studio, so don't risk it. ",

But you need to convince people to do it if you want someone to play your music. But before you go crazy (that's why you asked), you need to really think is it necessary? Change of tuning during a music will give a good chance of out of tune. So, why you need to change? Is it possible to to stay in drop C even playing the E tuning? How about two guitars? ",

As far as the execution, I'd recommend either two separate guitars, or bring the C up to D and capo back up to standard (assuming no floating bridge, of course). You'll have to retune a string or two, but it sounds like it'd be worth the extra set up time. ",

He could get there in one quick turn, while holding the note, the tuning itself was part of the song, taking one one beat and one quick motion. I don't see how you would do this on a guitar without some mechanical help, some contrivance so that you could do it quickly like Earl did. Or you could just write in a long bass / drum solo, and tune there. Probable easier to swap guitars. ",

Using two differently tuned guitars in one song may not be of too drastical change. Yet there are some songs which uses two different tuned guitars. The important point is how you will compose the song to get these different tunings go in beautiful agreement. This actually is a point that concerns the creative abilities. On the other hand, as technical wise, as in the other answers, you are better off using two separate diffrently tuned guitars. Or alternatively you may first record all the guitar parts separately on each different tunings of you are concerned about the tonal quality of the guitar sound. ",
