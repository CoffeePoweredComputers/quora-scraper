            "answer_text": "Are all Latin Americans the descendants of Muslims? No. Latin America is a diverse place with numerous immigrants and ethnicities. Many are indigenous peoples who haven\u2019t intermixed with others in millennia, while others have come from places such as Southern China and Japan, with minimal Muslims. Most Latin Americans? Possibly. A significant proportion of Latin Americans? Definitely, despite Muslims forming a minuscule proportion of the population of both Latin America and Spain. Remember: one only needs one ancestor who was a Muslim to be descended from a Muslim, even if that ancestor lived 900 years ago and was just one ancestor from that time out of thousands. Most of Latin America identifies as white or mestizo. Many, if not most of these people are of Spanish descent. Now let\u2019s go back to Spain during the Middle Ages. By 1000 AD, the Caliphate or C\u00f3rdoba dominated the Iberian peninsula. Most of Iberia, and most of the people who would eventually become Spanish lived under Muslim rule, and undoubtedly, many converted to Islam. Some historians estimate that as much as 80% of the population converted to Islam. Even if a smaller fraction of Spain converted to Islam, even a low number such as 15% or 25%, by the 1600s, virtually all Spaniards would have had at least some Muslim ancestors. 600 years correspond to 20\u201325 generations, or 1,000,000 to 33,000,000 ancestors. While inevitable inbreeding would reduce the actual number of ancestors (Spain had nowhere near 33 million people), the point is that people have an ungodly number of ancestors, and it would\u2019ve been virtually impossible for a Spaniard to not be descended from a Muslim. Given that virtually all Spaniards had Muslim ancestry by the 1600s, and that many, if not most Latin Americans are of Spanish ancestry, many if not most Latin Americans have Muslim ancestry, even if such ancestry is very distant.
