            "answer_text": "Naturally, some manufacturers figured out ways to profit off this, by making cheap copies and counterfeits of popular headphone models from brands like Apple, Beats, Bose, Marshall, Shure, and many more [you can found Cheap Reliable online Store of Top brand earphones]. Design IN THE BOX  There's very little difference in the packaging and in-the-box accessories for both the Beats Solo2 and the BeatsX. Looking closely, you can see that the carabiner hook of the Solo2 is a different color and the manual booklet is a little faded. The Beats logo sticker is glossier, and the box is a slightly different shade of red. As for the BeatsX, we couldn't get the same grey color variant of the real BeatsX we reviewed. However, they have pretty much the same content in the box. The only difference is the slightly off-color case and the free Apple Music card, which does not have a legitimate serial number to register the (fake) headphones. COMFORT  The most noticeable differences in comfort are with the over-ears. The fake Bose QuietComfort 25, especially, do not have the same degree of motion for their swivel hinge as the originals. While they are still very comfortable, especially for a knock-off, they do not have the same fit and padding as the real QuietComfort 25. The Beats Solo2 also are a bit different when it comes to comfort. While the original Solo 2 have always been a bit tight on the head, the padding of the fake Solo 2 makes the fit even tighter. The pads on the original are a bit more foldable, similar to memory foam, unlike the fakes which feel like cheap foam cushions. The padding on the fakes is also a bit thicker. BUTTONS  Buttons are not the most important aspect of a headphone's design but it can help you spot copies and counterfeits. The fake BeatsX have poor feedback for their control scheme compared to the original. It's most noticeable with the volume down button, which barely clicks when pressed. The fake Bose QuietComfort 25 have decent buttons, but the inline remote is cheaply built and of lower quality to the original. It rattles when you shake the cable, and it's also a different color to the real QC25's remote. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. The processes that ensure that the approved components, property coicingnand testing of the sound and other electrical components and mechanic tests for the physical properties of the headphone are parts of the \u201ccooking\u201d process that a recipe book from a knock off factory cannot duplicate. The best analogy is a cook trying to replicate someone soup by buying a bowl and deciphering the exact way it was made based on smell, taste and visuals When it comes down to it, only the chef knows where the ingredients come from, how long the soup base took to prepare and when to add each ingredient to to the soup while changing temperature, etc. A knock off artitst needs access to the kitchen and apprentice from those making the headphones in order to course the right compmemts, replicate the designs and to follow the same manufacturing processes to ensure the same performance from the product and the craftsmanship in the aesthetics and build My understanding of the current Beats Noise cancelling headphone so that the dual mic digital noise cancelling circuit is sourced and purchased exclusively form a major manufacture and is a heavily protected OECD of intellectual property. Only one other company has laid claim to overlapping tech in this field. I doubt that any other small knock off artist would have access to those parts. And if they do, it would not be worth the cost of producing them given the lean margins they leave on by selling and aesthetically identical product for a fraction of the price ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not. But with that said, you can almost always get headphones that, in a lot of regards, are as good or better than Beats for a lower price. Beats used to be notorious for being fragile and not very well made, but they seem to have gotten it figured out in the last few years, and especially now that they\u2019re owned by Apple, I\u2019d expect Apple\u2019s reputation and experience in building things really well to translate into modern Beats headphones. From an audio standpoint, it depends. Are you looking for something that \u201cenhances\u201d the sound and colors it very heavily, or are you looking for something that offers a detailed, balanced, natural overall sound signature? If you\u2019re in the first camp, Beats will be perfect, although there are plenty of other headphones who offer a similar sound signature at a much lower price. If you\u2019re in the second camp (like me), you will be very poorly served with Beats, and should instead focus on critically acclaimed audio brands like Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Grado, Audeze, etc. Basically, you should focus on the brands that every audiophile knows and probably at least respects, and which the everyday consumer probably has never heard of unless they have audiophile friends. This is one of my favorite videos about Beats, which explains why they are so expensive (primarily advertising):  ",

            "answer_text": "No. But they\u2019re worth the price you pay for them, if you get them dirt cheap (no more than $80 which is usually the case). They\u2019d also be just alright, considering that Beats cans are just okay. I\u2019d never buy original Beats cans because they are a horrible value. I can get real audiophile gear for that money. I\u2019m not saying you should buy fakes. But there are tons of much cheaper cans and buds that give you the same or better quality for the price. ",
