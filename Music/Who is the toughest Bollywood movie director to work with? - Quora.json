            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A:  This man is the toughest director. Why? Ask his actors. He takes minimum 40 takes for each shot. Just to simplify it, every scene is composed of number of shots. Different shots are taken by placing the camera at different positions and actors redo the entire scene for every angel. Right, most of the movies are shot with a single camera. So whenever you notice that a camera angle has changed thrice during a certain scene, it means that scene has performed thrice by the actors, while position of camera was changed every time. Now, it never happens that every shot is done by acting it just once. There are bloopers, interruptions, technical problems, actors missing the line, not doing it right and several others. So, obviously every shot has to be shot multiple times until it gets perfect. This every attempt is called as \u2018take\u2019. Usually 5 - 6 takes are taken by directors and best part of each one will be seen in the final cut. Sometimes some scenes are done in one take. Climax scene of Krantiveer, the long monologue of Nana Patekar was a fabulous example of scene done in a single take. Coming back to the answer, Bhansali is well known for taking at least 40 or more takes of each individual shot. Now imagine if you are laughing in a scene, then you have to laugh 40 times after every cut. If you are crying, then you have to cry 40 times, if you angry, you have to shout 40 times. Imagine the stress level of the actor during the shoots. Still they give us memorable scenes. That\u2019s the power of an actor. They keep giving takes after takes without getting exhausted. Also ask his production designers. He is also known to have a grand scale visual maker. Even if he wants to shoot a scene in a hall of a mansion, he wants it to be biggest. Nitin Desai, his long time collaborator reportedly said that, no matter how big set he used to build for him (for Devdas) director always told him to go even bigger. At the end of the chain of going bigger Nitin Desai got tired and said, there is no place now behind this where we can expand it even more. He eventually built an set of an entire indoor city for him for Sawariya. Also ask his music directors. (Since he has become the one now, so you can ask the team working under him) Just like any other departments, he is also demanding here. He wants the biggest instrumentation for his music (Remember Devdas, Hum dil de chuke sanam). He is never happy with smaller orchestra delivering the content. Ask his CGI team. Just watch Bajirao Mastani or Padmavat, you will find finest graphics work done in the indian films. Just check their behind the scene graphics making videos on Youtube. You will be mesmerized by knowing, a lot of things we thought to be real, were actually computer generated. No doubt we never noticed on screen. Overall, he is the most challenging filmmaker to work with. ",
