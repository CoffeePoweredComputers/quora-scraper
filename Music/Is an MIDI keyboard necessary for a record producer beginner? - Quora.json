            "answer_text": "You mean a Beatmaker? Record Producers aka Music Producers are people that directs and oversees recording sessions as they have nothing to do with composing tracks. They are the visonary of the entire recording being made that provides guidance through out the entire recording process. They coach the artist to get the best vocal performance out of them, vocal arrangements etc. Beatmakers on the other hand are the same thing as Songwriters and Composers that compose and program beats, They are generally credited as Writer, Composer, Instrumentation or Programmer. I do both roles myself as I started out as a beatmaker in 2004 before I took over the acting role as wearing the Producer\u2019s hat in 2008 working directly with my first artist one on one in the studio. As a Beatmaker, yes you generally would need some kind of keyboard to compose tracks if you are writing and programming music with a DAW or using hardware. I use a combination of both hardware and software myself as I still have a collection of outboard hardware that I\u2019ve kept over the years. The keyboard above my Yamaha Motif ES keyboard is a Roland PCR-500 midi controller that I use with my soft synths for my DAW.  ",
