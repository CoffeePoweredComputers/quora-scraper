            "answer_text": "We studied this in my Children\u2019s Literature class at M.C.C. During the Medieval and Renaissance periods, there were many fairs, feasts, and festivals, as well as traveling Bards, minstrels, and story tellers. They\u2019d tell their tales to the public with coins tossed into a hat, in town squares and again in taverns. They were often bawdy tales, which were told to everyone. Childhood wasn\u2019t seen as a separate stage of maturity and growth from adulthood at that time. They were viewed as miniature adults. All the adult stories were told to children. Their clothes, toys, games, etc. were all geared down to child-sized, but all were smaller versions of the adults\u2019. (I\u2019ve read many of the older 1300\u20131700\u2019s stories! Ones we now call \u201cFairy Tales\u201d. Just ONE example of is from 1600\u2019s, where Red Riding Hood is forced to EAT/cannibalize her Grandma, and then forced into bed with Mr. Wolf, in explicit detail! Some are more horrific. The old stories originally had cannibalism, rape, molestation, eyes pecked out, boiled alive, and violence beyond belief. Cinderella and Snow White didn\u2019t go unscathed! Would be better than any horror story that\u2019s on the movies today. A really good orator could put the audience on the edges of their seats! IF you get the chance and are interested in the tales BGB-Before Grimm Brothers, borrow a copy from the library of \u201cThe Classic Fairy Tales\u201d Edited by Maria Tatar, A Norton Critical Edition. Mine was published by W.W. Norton & Co., 1999. Is a pretty good scare. Must have made them so scared back then, they\u2019d fear going out to the outhouse! Gave me a few nightmares! ",

            "answer_text": "Before the age of Industrial Revolution and modern medicine, an average human being had the life expectancy of 30 years. For the rich and ruling class, the life expectancy was a bit higher and for the peasants and the poor it was lower.In medieval times, there was no concept of \u201cteen-age\u201d years, meaning the transition from being a child to being an adult was quite sudden, if not instant.Most peoples lived and died within 5 mile radius. And that 5 mile radius was their entire world.Young children, would help their families with their lands (farming / day laboring / household chores). And as soon as they were old enough they were either married and joined in an apprenticeship i.e. like becoming a blacksmith, rather than a farmer.Around the world, during the medieval times there was the feudal system where almost often the farmers were the lowest class, and the kings and soldiers formed the upper most class. Traders were in between these two extremes. Social mobility was almost impossible.Now, answering you question, factoring in points [1] to [5], poor people usually lived for 30 years, worked in the fields from sunrise to sunset, often very poorly feed on a monotonous diet. A vast majority of them had no access to everyday entertainment. But if you consider yearly cycles, then they did have occasional fairs, travelling circuses, market days, religious holidays, festivals, etc.",
