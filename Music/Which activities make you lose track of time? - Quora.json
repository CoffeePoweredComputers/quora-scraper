For the last few nights, as I'm crawling into bed, I've said to myself that I'm just going to log in real quick and see if I have any interests before I go to sleep. Then, the next thing I notice is that's it's 4 or 5 o\u2019clock in the morning & I don't know how it happened\u2026AGAIN! Then I start to feel a little panic, worrying how much this sleep deprivation is going to send me to an early grave. Today I actually did an internet search to see what blood tests results change when you haven't slept. That eventually led me to trying to find out if the local nutrition shop sells Orexin-A (they don't). So I set my alarm for when I needed to get up, and then moaned outloud at myself when I realized that the alarm was going to go off only a few hours later. I sat down my phone and finally went to sleep. ",
