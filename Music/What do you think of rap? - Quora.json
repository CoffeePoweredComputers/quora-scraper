            "answer_text": "Rap is a really beautiful artform. I see it as a 'collage' form of music where many artisits cut up and rearrange existing sections of music to make something new and  tell their stories over the top akin to the original Blues artists of yesteryear. Gangster Rap on the other hand is perhaps something very dark indeed. There is evidence to suggest that through privatisation of the USA prison system there is big profit to be made by having a high percentage of the population incarceated. Some record industry bosses wanted to 'dip their bread in that gravy' and through a few very private meetings, Gangster Rap was born to promote violence, gangs, accumulation of wealth through nefarious means and objectification of women through pimping, prostitution and rape.  Many young people wanting 'respect' and all the glamourous trappings and lifestyle that these Gangter Rappers portrayed in their lyrics and videos fell into the trap and acted out these same fantasies in the real world, became imprisoned and helped boost the Record Industry profits through their shares in the prison system. What does a typical gang memeber in the USA 'earn' through crime? About the same as working in WalMart. The whole thing is a massive con. Oh yes - you know the phrase 'It's all Gravy' that you hear in many of these songs? That is insider slang for quite literally 'I took it up the ass from Record Executives' in exchange for being a successful Gangster Rapper. If you come out and mention any of this to the public, we expose you to the world as a homosexual. I know it sounds crazy, but we live in a crazy world... ",

            "answer_text": "Rap is a musical art style of which I'm a very big fan of. It  has 2 sides, there's the ones about money, drugs, alcohol and profanity, like \"We made you\" by eminem and \"California\" by Hollywood Undead, the ones that are usually subjected to articles on how they're influencing kids these days, and the ones that are meaningful and deep that talk about matters such as love, suicidal tendencies, betrayal, past mistakes, etc. Like the songs, the rappers are also subjected to crisis  for the types of songs they make, like how people would judge eminem for being vulgar and profound after hearing \"The Real Slim Shady\" or \"Criminal\" and yet they forget the things he's been through and the stories he tells in songs such as \"Like Toy Soldiers\" and \"Mockingbird\" and refuse to acknowledge not eminem, not slim shady, but Marshall Matgers himself. (Sorry if I sound like some kind of  fanboy, I just really like his music) ",
