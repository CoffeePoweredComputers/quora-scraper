            "answer_text": "The song that perfectly describes my 2020 so far is \u201c70 years\u2019, done by me about six years ago when I lost my mum. My mum and I lived together all my life until she passed on. So when she died the impact of her passing made me to realize how little the time we humans have to spend on earth and why we should live our lives in such a way that we will be able to give a positive account of it in the end. I recently shot a video of the song but the lyrics keep coming back to me each time i listen to it especially at this time of uncertainty regarding this corona virus out break. Though I love other songs and I have other songs done by me, but this particular \u201c70 years\u2019 is not just a song to me, but a message. please pardon me if I say that one of my songs is the song that perfectly describes my 2020.
