            "answer_text": "I think post-grunge is a pejorative term for bands (and their music) that were blatantly copying innovative and distinctive bands whose popularity had largely faded following the folding of Nirvana (the band most synonymous with the so-called genre). Not only are post-grunge ham-fistedly derivative and in original, but their sound is inferior to the bands they try to sound like. (They don't have the x-factor that the trendsetting bands had.) They also sound outdated, like products of a bygone era. (The trendsetting grunge bands channeled the pessimism and cynicism of the Pacific Northwest circa the early 90s.) Examples of post-grunge bands: Bush / Bush XCollective Soul (early)Theory of a DeadmanStaind",

            "answer_text": "thing is, grunge is not really a genre rather than a scene, in that sense, unlike the punk /post-punk music, which are clearly two separeted genres stylistically. Plus, grunge became a trend in it\u2019s time, so in reality every band that played \u201cgrunge like\u201d and surfaced after the first original generation of grunge bands is post-grunge. But the post-grunge concept is not and aesthetic one but commercial, so every band that played \u201cgrunge\u201d trying to capitalize on the early 90\u2019s grunge trend could be labeled as post-grunge, as they were not \u201cmoving forward\u201d the genre but were just rounded by music labels to make some buck. Nickelback, Creed, Foo Fighters, Matchbox Twenty are example of post-grunge bands, whose objective was clearly to make the \u201cgrunge sound\u201d comercially acceptable by lowering on the angst and loudness.

            "answer_text": "\u2018Post\u2019 anything is music that is influenced by something yet is different. REM was a \u2018Post-Punk\u2019 band. They were singer songwriters that used punk style licks and riffs throughout their music. Grunge was basically a rehash of Bad Brains more or less. Bad Brains took the music of the Sex Pistols and the Ramones and fused it with Black Sabbath (originally they were a fusion jazz band ironically). Grunge took this a step further and fleshed it out with more \u2018complex\u2019 songwriting. ",

I don\u2019t mind that they used grunge as their foundation. I think of it as inspiration and a natural progression of where music was going in the 90\u2019s.
