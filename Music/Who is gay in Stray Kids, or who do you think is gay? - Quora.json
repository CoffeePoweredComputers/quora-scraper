            "answer_text": "no one in stray kids has confirmed their sexuality so as far as we know they are whatever they are lol. i\u2019m not going to just say they\u2019re straight because we need to break the \u201cstraight is the default\u201d mindset, so atm they\u2019re sexualities are n/a unless they confirm something themselves. now who do i think is gay? well\u2026if i\u2019m honest stray kids all act gay or have at some point, but that mainly because we as fans view them being gay as being touchy and comfortable with one another or them saying cute things to each other. of course the possibility that they are attracted to each other or to guys is up there since they are all extremely close and have not confirmed their preferences, but they could also be attracted to women as well so who knows. anyways back to who i think could be gay. this is all just what my thoughts are, i am not making assumptions nor am i enforcing you to believe my opinions. felixi think almost every stay knows why he\u2019s on this list lol. i think felix could be bisexual. back during a fan sign, a fan asked felix was his ideal type was. felix then responded, \u201cboys or girls?\u201d to which the fan said either was fine. he then said for boys that changbin was his type because he\u2019s dark, strong, and muscular. then for girls he said that he loves all stays the way they are. this doesn\u2019t confirm that he\u2019s bisexual, but it definitely can lead to the idea that he\u2019s attracted to both girls and guys. he also gives of cute bi energy to me if that makes sense lol. (btw i\u2019m bi haha) 2. hyunjin so the main reason i think hyunjin is gay isn\u2019t because of his strong feminine side nor his dramatic personality (even though they are a factor). my main reason is due to what happened during one of his lives. while hyunjin was live, he decided to play some music. i don\u2019t know the name of the song, but one of the lines of the song was \u201cgoing on a picnic with a girlfriend\u201d. while hyunjin was singing along, rather than singing \u201cwith a girlfriend\u201d he sang \u201cwith a boy-\u201c as if he was about to say boyfriend rather than girlfriend. then when he realizes that he said the wrong lyrics he quickly corrects himself and sings \u201cwith a girlfriend\u201d. now, of course we don\u2019t know 100% if that\u2019s what he said, but in context, what else would he have said? unless girlfriend in korean sounds like boy, then it\u2019s not far fetched to think \u201cboy\u201d is what he said. another reason is that he corrected himself. if he was saying girlfriend i\u2019m korean per say, i don\u2019t think he\u2019d correct himself since he\u2019s technically not singing the wrong lyrics. (this sounds like an analysis oh god\ud83d\ude2d) anyways, it seems pretty obvious that he clearly knew said song before the live, so he must\u2019ve sang it before. it is known that some people change the lyrics to songs to meet their needs so they can connect to the song better. for example, changing the pronouns in songs. it\u2019s possible that hyunjin in the past changed the pronoun to boyfriend because he connects to that more than girlfriend. so while he was used to singing boyfriend while he was alone and off camera, he forgot to change back when he decided to sing the song live in camera. also, the thing about his personality, of course most would say i am judging him by stereotypes, but i think stereotypes are ok as long as they are used respectfully. i think stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. it\u2019s not odd that a group of people tend to act similarly since they share the same traits and interests. but when you judge someone at first glance based on stereotypes, that\u2019s not ok. assuming someone will act a certain way because of their traits and interests is not ok. BUT, someone acting like a stereotypical person in their group is ok. as long as you are not irrationally judging someone based on stereotypes, i think they are ok. now onto hyunjin. i won\u2019t be specific, but his vibe makes my gaydar go WEE WOO WEE WOO. that\u2019s all i\u2019ll say. 3. jeongin if i\u2019m honest i\u2019m kinda wishy washy about jeongin since he\u2019s never out right done anything that made me think\u2026that\u2019s a lil sus\u2026expect maybe his fanboying over how sexy he thought hyunjin looked for his psycho fancam lol, but a lot of idols have done similar things so it wasn\u2019t too much of a green light. personally i see jeongin as someone who would know that he\u2019s attracted to guys but doesn\u2019t deal with it much, he just kinda does what he does if that\u2019s makes sense. again, this is no confirmation of their sexualities, these are simply my opinions. regardless of their sexualities i hope stays will continue to support and love them because their sexuality does not define nor change who they are.

            "answer_text": "Only Felix has given ideal type for both, boys and girls. The rest of members have never stated any specific preferences for any gender. Honestly, it's none of anyone's, but their, bussiness. And fans can't label the members before they do that themselves. I don't understand how can people say: \u201cI bet Chan is straight\u201d or \u201cJisung is definitely gay\u201d. Like\u2026? I'm asking you: what makes you think they're gay or straight? Chan has never stated he was romantically interested in girls, nor Jisung ever stated he was romantically interested in men. So how can you think whether Chan is straight if he never said ANYTHING about his interests? Or how can you say Jisung or Minho are gay if they never said anything either? Just because Minho and Jisung are affectionate towards each other, it doesn't mean they're gay, and just because Chan doesn't do much skinship, it doesn't mean he's straight. Same goes to the rest of the group. Oh and also to the people who go anonymous and write something like: \u201cMy uncle is janitor at JYPE and he told me Jeonginnie oppa is straight\u201d yeah no, sorry to break it to you, but nobody's gonna believe that and these kind of answers are probably written by 12 year olds that badly want their male idols to be straight and don't actually know anyone that knows the idols personally. So stop anonymously answering in this ridiculous way. And if you actually knew their sexualities, I don't think you'd go and disclose their preferences to fans. If they're straight, cool. If they're gay, cool. If they're other sexuality, cool. I'll support them no matter what. But it's really not fans' place to determine what their sexualities are, especially when they said nothing about preferences for any gender (except for Felix, who said ideal type for both genders, but fans still shouldn't label him before he does it himself). So please stop assuming idols sexualities out of nowhere, or asking for assumptions about their romantic preferences. Stream Stray Kids' \u201cGod's menu\u201d official MV\u2764\ufe0f  ",
