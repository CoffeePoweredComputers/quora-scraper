            "answer_text": "How should you sell your song \u201ceasily?\u201d  Selling songs is certainly not \u201ceasy!\u201d Even the top artists in the world have to think very carefully about which song they choose to release, how to package it, what approach to take with the video, the timing of the release and more. To start with you must make sure that the song you write is capable of relating to the masses in a specific market and genre. There are certain subject matter that will always relate well such as: loverelationshipsHardshipMoneySexGoodtimesStreet lifeThese are just a few of the subjects that do well over and over as themes for song writers. Once you decide on your subject matter then you would need to target a genre. What style of song are you writing? How big is that target market? For instance; if you are trying to write a song about your hard life in your submarine in the style of African Rockabilly it probably won't stand as good a chance of being used as maybe a relationship song in the style of blues trap. There is a science involved with songwriting and a major factor is respect for statistics. Business is all about profit. Your song is supposed to attract investment prospects. It has to gain respect from business people who believe that your song will prove profitable because it is right for a certain act in a certain market at a certain time. Its anything but easy! Unless your name is Ed Sheeran! I did recently write an article called \u201c10 big reasons why songs don't catch on\u201d You might find it helpful. I hope this helps!
