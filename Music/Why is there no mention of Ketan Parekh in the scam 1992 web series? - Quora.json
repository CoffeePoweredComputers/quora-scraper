All four have been sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment by the special court trying the various cases related to the 1992 securities scam. According to the chargesheet filed by the CBI, the four former brokers had arranged for bogus ready forward (RF) transactions between Canfina and Canbank Mutual Fund during October 1991 to January 1992. In a ready forward transaction between two parties A and B, party A sells securities to party B for a certain amount, and agrees to buy those securities back at a slightly higher price at a pre-decided date in the future.
