            "answer_text": "The Lyrics: Who can say where the road goes Where the day flows, only time And who can say if your love grows As your heart chose, only time  Who can say why your heart sighs As your love flies, only time And who can say why your heart cries When your love lies, only time  Who can say when the roads meet That love might be in your heart And who can say when the day sleeps If the night keeps all your heart Night keeps all your heart  Who can say if your love grows As your heart chose Only time And who can say where the road goes Where the day flows, only time  Who knows? Only time  Basically, time is the great equalizer and answer of all questions. Ephesians\t1:10 As a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. Galatians\t4:4 But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. As I found out later, this song had been \u201cadopted\u201d for what happened on 9/11 Only Time by Enya - Songfacts It took on a very specialized meaning, then. ",
