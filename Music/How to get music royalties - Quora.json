            "answer_text": "I\u2019mgoing to re-post John\u2019s good answer, but with some additional explanation, because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not a professional: Mechanical royalties are calculated by the units produced and sold, less product returns (unsold records). \u201cMechanical royalties\u201d refers to copies of the recording sold, whether on CD or by download. They are paid to songwriters and publishers only, not artists. When recordings are sold, the record label must pay what is sometimes called an \u201cartist/producer royalty\u201d to the artist and producer. An example might be: 15% to the artist, 3% to the producer. The songwriter and publisher do not get a share of this. Record club and overseas sales usually pay a lower rate per record. \u201cPublishing\u201d refers to several types of royalties that go to the songwriter/publisher, not the artist. These royalties include both the mechanical royalties referred to above and so-called \u201cperformance royalties\u201d for broadcast/web streaming/live performance of the song. It is not the artist who licenses the song per se, it is the publisher. The record label may license a particular recording of the song (by their artist) but they do not license the song itself, just the performance of the song they own, of the record they are selling. In other words, if you want to use the original recording of \u201cHelp\u201d by the Beatles for your documentary about the Trump administration, you need two licenses - one from the record label and one from the publisher. Performance royalties must be paid by everyone from national TV networks all the way down to bars and clubs and dentist offices that play the radio in their businesses. ASCAP, BMI and SESAC license their entire catalogues to these end-users (so called blanket-licenses) and collect on behalf of publishers. The formulas for payment and the determination of which artists and publishers get paid how much for what are complex, and would take a few pages here to explain. The formulas tend to favor big publishers and hit artists, vs. all other music (film scores, TV music, advertising music, etc.) Publishing [for radio airplay] is calculated by the number of radio plays as estimated as a percentage of all radio spins, based on sampling stations play logs.And streaming is [paid] per stream - a tiny fraction of a penny per stream. Then, there are special laws covering satellite, cable, etc. Royalties for both artists and writers and even side musicians. There are union payments (Musicians\u2019 union and singers\u2019 union) that can generate further royalties, called residuals. Finally, if music is staged, such as songs in a stage / movie musical, special royalties for the writer/publisher for these so-called \u201cgrand rights\u201d spring into play. Sound complicated? It is, and this ain\u2019t the half of it. Plus, it\u2019s changing all the time in various ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the most prominent ways to receive music royalties: Physical or Download Purchases The most traditional way of receiving royalties for music is from physical or digital sales (from a digital standpoint, this means anything that is a permanent download for the consumer to keep). There are typically different rates for the various types of sales for albums, which break down into LP (which stands for long-playing vinyl, which is synonymous with a full album) or EP (extended play album, which has up to five songs and is often used for promotional purposes). If you are contracted under a music label, there is a negotiated artist rate that typically falls between 13-20% of the wholesale price of a purchased album or single song. The wholesale price typically falls between $7-10. This is the price before the digital service providers add their markup to sell it at retail price. The most popular digital service providers for downloadable music today include iTunes, Amazon and Google Play. Audio Streaming Audio streaming services allow consumers to choose songs to play at will on the cloud. Revenue is generated from advertising and subscription fees. The royalties are calculated based on the negotiated compensation that the record label receives per subscriber. The royalties due to the label is based on the negotiated subscriber rate multiplied by the proportion of streams from the label against the total number of streams for each subscriber. The label then further distributes what is due to the artist based on their artist rate against the portion of the number of streams by that artist over the total number of streams from the label. If this sounds small, you aren\u2019t wrong, as the range goes from .001 to .007 per stream. Here\u2019s an article discussing the range of royalty rates among major streaming channels. These digital service providers includes Spotify, Apple Music, Napster and Amazon. Performance SocietyPerformance societies collect royalties of public performances from radios, nightclubs, live venues and more. Performance societies negotiate the fees for the license, licenses the songs, collect the royalties due and distributes them to the necessary parties. While artists typically get their revenue from the ticket sales, performance societies are still due their cut to pay the necessary parties involved behind the performed songs. The well-known performance societies include ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, which are specific to paying performance royalties to songwriters, publishers and composers. SoundExchange is specific to digital performance royalties (from such sources as SiriusXM and Pandora) and pays music labels and artists. Sync Sync royalties are royalties due from licenses to use music in a film, TV show, commercial and video games. These are typically a flat-fee license for a negotiated term of usage. Compilations Compilations are albums that include multiple artists, such as movie soundtracks or themed albums like hits from a certain era. The royalties are based on a pro-rata royalty, where you receive royalties based on your portion of songs on the soundtrack (i.e. the album royalties divided by portion of the artist\u2019s one song of the album\u2019s total ten songs). As usual, the artist is then paid their artist royalty negotiated with the music label and/or compilation contract. RingtonesRoyalties are due from a certain portion of the ringtone price from each downloaded ringtone, then distributed to the artist based on your rate with the record label. There are over a dozen major digital service providers (and over 100 more that are smaller providers and international providers) to which music content can be licensed to receive royalties. Many music labels work with distribution companies to help streamline the effort of receiving reporting and collecting royalties from such numerous providers. However, as the margins become smaller and more convoluted with the increasing complexity of royalty structures, it becomes ever more difficult for new artists to become profitable. As technology progresses, one of the persistent issues in the ever-evolving music industry is transparency. As the concept of blockchain technology progresses to decentralize and integrate data across the internet, such technology is also evolving to help artists. We at Soundeon are working to help artists gain clarity on their performance across multiple providers. This helps artists gain more autonomy, as well as improve reach with their audience due to an increasing visibility of the vast terrain of digital service providers, concert ticket sales and video content. For a more thorough understanding of royalties, a great source for any artist, music label, producer or other music industry professional is All You Need to Know About the Music Business by Donald S. Passman. ",

            "answer_text": "There actually are several models. If you\u2019re a musician but not a songwriter, your performance on a recording is copyrighted, usually by the recording company. They then pay you residuals according to your contract. If you\u2019re a songwriter, in some cases the record label will require you to assign them the rights to your creations in a contract. That happened to Taylor Swift earlier in her career, and she recently had to go through legal proceedings to get the company to permit her to perform those songs! In those cases you get paid residuals on the record sales. If you retain rights to your own songs, then you get paid a standard royalty. I recall Eric Sylvester, a session guitarist who recorded with Peter, Paul and Mary and others, recounting how John Denver put one of his songs on a best-selling album; Eric got huge royalty checks every month for several years, then they got smaller and less frequent\u2014so write a song, keep the copyright, and get it on a big seller and you\u2019re set up for retirement. In other cases, some firms will find a promising young artist and sign a representation agreement. This gives the promising young artist a fair amount of money in return for the rights to the songs. The Robert Stigwood Organization did that with Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton, and the Bee Gees; Top RankkRpoductions owned Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues until 1978 or so. The artist still generates some residuals from the songs but the big money from those hits gets sucked up hby the licensing firm. Now, another level of royalties comes from airplay and cover bands and the like. There are firms like BMI and ASCAP who administer most of those payments. Usually the perrformence venue will pay a flat annual fee for performances of copyrighted songs (not only bars and concert halls but also schools and universities). Radio and streaming services track number of plays and pay a little for each. Then the firm that collected the money estimates how much your material got used and sends you some money. ",

            "answer_text": "Owners of publishing and songwriter performance rights typically rely on the efforts of Performance Rights Organizations (PROs). These organizations are responsible for collecting Performance royalties on the behalf of artists and musicians. This is important because the PROs are not in charge of collecting mechanical royalties, synchronization royalties., or (usually) digital performance royalties tied to master recordings. We will cover that in a moment. Remember, public performance royalties are paid whenever a song is played in public. This includes the playing of a song on radio (AM/FM, streaming, or satellite), in a concert hall or in a restaurant, and on television shows and commercials. After the PRO collects royalties, they distribute them to the rights holders. Songwriters and publishers are encouraged to join a PRO and register songs and their locations to ensure prompt payment of their royalties. There are four PROs in the United States: ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers)BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.)SESAC (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers)SoundExchangeMore information you can find here.

            "answer_text": "There are two music copyrights that generate revenue in the music business: the sound recording copyright (i.e., the master recording) and the musical work copyright (i.e., the song or composition). If you author or co-author one of those copyrights, then you are a stakeholder that is supposed to be compensated (e.g. with royalties) for the use of the copyright you created. Until you sell your ownership of the copyright (e.g., sell your masters to a record company or your compositions to a publisher) you are an owner of the copyright and will be entitled to both the owner's and creator's respective shares of royalties. Even after you sell your copyrights, typically you will collect compensation for the creator's share only. The US copyrights include the right to display, reproduce, perform and make a derivative work from a copyright, so these are the types of uses that generate compensation for the owners and creators of copyrights. Other countries have similar but not identical rules. Many of the answers here reference ASCAP and BMI as music royalties sources. While these organization indeed collect and distribute to owners/publishers and composers/songwriters of compositions a great deal of the royalties in the music business, currently these organizations are just two of several that license the performing rights of music compositions. So, if you are a master stakeholder and not a composition stakeholder, you won't be collecting any royalties from ASCAP or BMI, but you may collect sound recording performance royalties from SoundExchange and other types of license fees and/or royalties from other sources. Basically, you need to understand that there are other sources of royalties besides performance royalties. In any case, in order to earn music royalties you need to either create or acquire a musical sound recording and/or a musical composition and then these copyrights need to be registered and exploited to generate revenue that you can participate in and there are many different income streams, so you might need to hire an expert to help you optimize your royalty earnings.

I believe they mostly use a system that they call \u201csampling\u201d where they collect a bunch of cue sheets and logs from radio stations and TV stations (at random) and split the all the royalties collected that year to the artists that came up in the search. For live concerts, venues are required to pay a annual blanket license to each P.R.O. for performing works in their catalog. The annual license fee is about $500 per year. When a live performance is reported (through ASCAP\u2019s OnStage service for example), they calculate the royalty based on how many people can fit in that room (using the building\u2019s fire code). The $500 royalty they collected at the beginning of the year is split up to everyone who's song had a performance in that vanue. After that, the royalties are split 50/50 between the writers and publishers. Additional splits may also take place via contract agreements. Internet radio royalties are collected in a similar fashion; however, they are collected by SoundExchange. Pretty much all other royalties are up to the copyright owners of the song; although, there are some few exceptions. ",
