            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a professional singer nor an expert, so I could be wrong. You sing well when you have musicality: you are intoned and manage to do well with different basic rhythms without messing up the entrances, getting confused, and things like these; if you have the sensitivity to really feel the lyrics you are singing, making them feel to the people that are listening too. If you are acquainted with the breathing techniques that keep your vocal cords safe. You sing very well when you have a peculiar voice that can be recognized and it\u2019s pleasant to hear (and all the above too), particularly if it has a strong, rich sound. A malleable, agile voice that feels at ease with more than a genre, and with more syncopated rhythms. A full vocal range that goes from deep notes to very high ones would help too, but even if you don\u2019t have it, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you really own the one you got. You are a great singer if you have imagination, adding all the above. If you dare to break the schemes; if you have the full control of your voice and rhythm and don\u2019t fear messing them up to gain a new sound. If you can sing above a polyrhythm, or with keys, tempos and rhythms changing abruptly. If you are unique, with your own style; if you own the technical dexterities of your main genre and use them proficiently to best suit the song you are singing. Examples of great singers could be Freddie Mercury, Aretha Franklin, Robert Plant, Nina Simone, Anna Moffo, Maria Callas, David Bowie, Mina, Mahalia Jackson, Philippe Jaroussky, and these are just the ones that are coming into my mind right now, there are many more. Sorry if I made mistakes in English, I\u2019m still learning. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the question directed to a person or some persons? Well if you're to ask who sings well then I'd like to say that it is someone who really practice, practice and practice over and over again. There's no limit when it comes to singing, everyday new things are leant. Have you had time to do the normal basic vocal exercises like breathing exercises. Singing absolutely well depends on what music is to you? The question is, are you just singing for fun or you are turning it into a profession? There you'll know who sings well. Beyonce is one of the outstanding vocalist. She's one of the best because she went to a music school despite she naturally being vocally good and knew her vocal range,texture and therefore knows how's to go about managing her voice. Alisha keys, Frank Sinatra are all very good singers because they practice virtually every day. ",
