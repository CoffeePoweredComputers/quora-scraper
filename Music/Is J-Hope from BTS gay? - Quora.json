            "answer_text": "I say this in every answer I do for these questions and I will say it again, DO NOT ASSUME HIS SEXUALITY, I AM NOT ASSUMING HIS SEXUALITY I AM MERELY GIVING MY THOUGHTS BASED ON GIVEN EVIDENCE, I AM NOT GOD IDK FOR SURE IF THIS IS YES OR NO, DO NOT TAKE MY WORD AS GOSPEL. Okay so to start off I\u2019m just gonna day rn I personally believe Hobi might be one of the straightest straight in BTS. While yes he clearly shows minor evidence of possibly being bi or MAYBE homosexual I believe the evidence of him being straight is greater. Much like every member except Yoongi, Hobi has never said anything referring directly to his sexuality being anything other than straight, but unlike a lot of the other members, Hobi hasn\u2019t really shown himself as anything other than straight in ANY WAY. I can\u2019t seem to find many little hints like I can with the rest. I think one of my biggest pieces of evidence that might say Hobi is at least a little gay is that he is Dom #1 in BTS. He seems to put dom every single member in every chance he gets. Whether is occasionally choking Jimin just cause he can, or it\u2019s hitting a member because they talked back harshly (tho this one is usually out of fun) or maybe it\u2019s his glare when a member irritates him, HOBI IS A DOM AND A POSSIBLY GAY ONE. Otherwise I find Hobi to be straight. He may seem happy and \u201cgay\u201d all the time but he also has never really given us hints saying he\u2019s anything but straight. To further show this he is the only member to openly give details about a past relationship, which was with a girl who left him for another man. (Haha she probs regrets her decision so much rn) And ik this isn\u2019t really liable evidence but as a pansexual male myself I have a gaydar and Hobi doesn\u2019t set it off. (Again not real evidence but like my gaydar is pretty accurate) Anyway in conclusion, Hobi is probs the straighter out of the 7 but that\u2019s just my opinion so I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. Hope you got the answer you wanted ^-^ ",

He is among the straightest members in the group.Tbh I\u2019ve been watching their journey since 2012 to date and I don\u2019t think any of them is gay or bisexual like how some see Suga or Jimin to be. No one knows exactly what makes their d*cks hard off camera but can only speculate and from what I\u2019ve seen,they are all straight men. RM 100% p*ssy guy Jin 100% p*ssy guy JHope 100% p*ssy guy V 100% p*ssy guy Jungkook 100% p*ssy guy Jimin 100% p*ssy guy Suga - He can be but will be a very soft and sensitive guy. ",
