            "answer_text": "I think a lot of it comes out of jealousy, but if you want a more comprehensive answer, here are some of my thoughts: They created something new out of what already was. If you look at the music in the late 1960s when Zeppelin debuted, it was very psychedelic in nature. The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper in \u201967 which turned the music landscape upside down. Hendrix followed a year later with Electric Ladyland, and that\u2019s not even mentioning the adventure that was the Moody Blues who released Days of Future Passed (1967), In Search of the Lost Chord (1968) and On the Threshold of a Dream (1969). Music was experimental, and Zeppelin sought something different. They sought to create something new, something which had never been heard before. They took the blues and created something heavy out of it. Something extremely heavy for the time. Zeppelin was not by any measure a psychedelic band, and when Zeppelin I debuted in 1969 it went against the growing trend and basically announced that a new dawn had emerged. Shortly after this album debuts, the music industry changes too. The music begins to get heavier and experimentalization takes the form of guitar driven blues and creating the heavy sound. The shift from singles to album oriented rock begins. Zeppelin created something new out of what already was. I think the reason why a lot of people don\u2019t like them is because they weren\u2019t smart enough to come up with that. The Who had a great album in \u201cThe Who Sells Out\u201d but after Zeppelin, everything changed. Just look at the difference in music released in 1968 and 1970 and you will be able to see what I am saying.Led Zeppelin did not respect what was. Again referring to my prior point, Zeppelin did everything against the book. They were not a singles band, they rarely did TV interviews and they did not follow the mainstream. The music company did not control them, they controlled their own destiny. The freedom which Zeppelin enjoyed to create their own music was, I think, a cause of great jealous for many of their contemporaries. While the Who and the Rolling Stones had to follow the advice of their record label, Zeppelin had a very powerful manager in Peter Grant which basically told the record label to shove it. Zeppelin had freedom, other\u2019s did not. Not until the mid-70s.Led Zeppelin insulted the blues. Plagiarism allegations aside, Zeppelin, by their very work, insulted the blues. They took old blues standards: You Shook Me by Muddy Waters, You need love by Willie Dixon, Killing Floor by Howlin Wolf and just manipulated and twisted it so much that they made it their own. It wasn\u2019t that Led Zeppelin didn\u2019t care about the blues, I know each member loved and worshiped the blues masters, but this wasn\u2019t about paying homage to their idols, it was about creating their own work and being counted on their own terms. That upset a lot of people, a lot of the blues guys thought it was disrespectful and it might have been, but Led Zeppelin did not care at all.I honestly don\u2019t think the critics knew what they were listening too, it was so different that I guess I couldn\u2019t blame them for being critical. But, obviously, Zeppelin won in the end because their music is adored by millions. ",

            "answer_text": "English or American critics? For a start, as the Yardbirds\u2019 popularity dwindled the New Yardbirds/Led Zeppelin inherited that disinterest from the musical community; even when the drummer was asked to join he initially refused - dismissing them as \u201cirrelevant\u201d. After recording their debut album at the guitarist\u2019s expense, their shrewd manager was virtually laughed out of record company offices when he attempted to initiate a recording contract - despite the guitarist & bassist\u2019s reputations as the top session players in London! So realising that America was where the action was, they went over; given Page\u2019s reputation in the Yardbirds - along with a good word from Dusty Springfield, whose album was arranged by Led Zeppelin\u2019s bassist/keyboardist - Atlantic Record could not sign a lucrative deal fast enough. Back in England, the press/critics were a little miffed that this band of young upstarts had betrayed & \u2018deserted\u2019 them by signing to an overseas record company - & were not prepared (broadminded/mature enough) for their brash loud music (although Hendrix & Black Sabbath were acceptable); the band didn\u2019t \u2018grow up in public\u2019 - they were a \u2018hyped up\u2019 bunch of misfits refusing to obey the rules (releasing singles &/or appearing on TV shows such as \u201cTop Of The Pops\u201d or \u201cOld Grey Whistle Test\u201d). Furthermore, they were always touring over in America - how dare they!!! In return, Led Zeppelin decided that they would ignore the critics/media and just get on with recording & performing music - infuriating the critics, as the band weren\u2019t playing the game. Although the 2nd album was more developed, the 3rd was not a repeat of the previous one, so it was given the most brutal thumbs down possible. Although it really hurt the band, not to be outdone they released the next album with NO writing on the cover at all!!!! The band\u2019s behaviour was becoming somewhat decadent on tour - that certainly didn\u2019t help public relations. Then again, by the mid 70\u2019s if you\u2019re selling more records & concerts than the Rolling Stones - do you really care what the critics think?  ",
