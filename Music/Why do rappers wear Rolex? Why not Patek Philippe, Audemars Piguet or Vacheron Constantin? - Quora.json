            "answer_text": "I don't know of any rap artists that wear Pateks or VC, but as a matter of fact, Janelle Monae spends a great deal of time mentioning Piguets in her music, and they've shown up in Jay-Z's music as well. Additionally, Nicki Minaj has a diamond studded AP Royal Oak that she brings out on the regular. It's true though, rappers do tend to gravitate towards Rolex. I suspect it's for two reasons: one, it's a traditional status symbol, and two, Rolex helpfully obliges the desire for ostentation in its customers by making a lot of models in flamboyant colors and encrusted in jewels. In fact, the desire for flash is probably what also drives the popularity of Hublot among rap artists as well, considering that brand's deserved reputation for making expensive and garish limited editions.

            "answer_text": "Because Rolex is a popular brand, and is known to people of all walks of life. Perhaps this is the only luxury brand of timepieces some rappers know.The audience of rap music are much less familiar with brands like Patek Philippe.Few people are horology enthusiasts, even among more affluent circles, so there is no use mentioning such niche knowledge on what is essentially pop music for the masses.",
