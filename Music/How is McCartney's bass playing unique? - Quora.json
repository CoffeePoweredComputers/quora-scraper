            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen so many of these kinds of questions that I almost passed this one by. Someone may answer in highly technical terms how Paul\u2019s bass playing is or isn\u2019t unique. I look forward to reading it. As for me, I\u2019ll say that\u2019s not the point. For what it\u2019s worth, I think that Paul McCartney could pick up a trash can and record a masterpiece. He\u2019s. Just. That. Good. Each of the Beatles had their own styles, which were quite varied. But you don\u2019t listen to a Beatles tune - any - because this or that one played a cool riff that\u2019s unmistakably him. Each Beatle contributed their unique and formidable talent, not to show off, but to the SONG. None went into the studio to play something that overshadowed the rest of the band, but to enhance the SONG. It was always the SONG. Vocally, now that\u2019s different. They each had unique and recognizable voices, and used them well. Their lead vocals were distinctly that Beatle - as it should be. In the early days and especially live, John and Paul even traded off lines on lead vocal because one of them (usually Paul) could nail that one note - then back to the regular parts. Their incredible harmony work, like their instrumental work, was solely to contribute to the SONG. Whether in ensemble or solo, each Beatle\u2019s first and only objective was to make the SONG the best they could. Not that they didn\u2019t have egos, but I marvel at how little ego touched them in the studio, at least in the final product. They were a band, each part contributing to a greater whole. The SONG. That\u2019s what made the Beatles the Beatles. Total dedication to the SONG. ",

            "answer_text": "Paul\u2019s bass playing is very good, but not necessarily unique. I appreciate that he did a lot of bass lines that added movement under the guitars without treading on them. He also created parts that could become the musical hook. An example is the fuzz tone bass on Think For Yourself. He also did bass parts that became signature guitar lines. Examples would be Day Tripper and Birthday. I\u2019ve noticed that his bass line in Rain became something he fell back to often and comfortably. This gets straight to music theory. It\u2019s a one measure line. You need to know music theory for bass to follow this. Paul starts the first note on the root note of the chord. Then he hits the note an octave higher (up 2 strings and 2 frets). The third note is the Perfect 4th (up one string from the root) and hammering the 5th (up 2 frets higher) and resolving on the 7th, which is up 2 strings from the root. As the lead in to the next measure he can quickly hit the 5th again. Every other measure instead of the 5th, he can do a triplet of the 5th, 4th and 2nd (which is 2 frets up from the root. You notice that all the notes are the 3 string above the root or 2 frets up an the same 3 strings. It forms a box. It\u2019s a lot of fluidity but only requires the index finger and ring finger with your hand positioned for the root. You\u2019ll find Paul uses this line a lot. ",
