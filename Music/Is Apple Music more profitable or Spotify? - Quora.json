Apple Music is part of Apple\u2019s Services which are hugely profitable and growing, but it\u2019s impossible to know if the service is profitable on its own. It\u2019s likely that it probably breaks even since Apple\u2019s overhead costs are much lower. The fact that Apple has so many products and services means that they can subsidize parts of their ecosystem that make less money on their own. Either way, it\u2019s clear who the winner is here. ",

The well-known music executive Jimmy Iovine said that they must have original content (like Netflix) to attract customers. This means the next phase of growth for both companies requires additional capital\u2026 Apple has this capital in abundance, but Spotify does not... Although Spotfiy is more profitable now, it will be a very very different story in 2-3 years time. ",
