            "answer_text": "I\u2019d do exactly what I did last time a large sum turned up in my account that I knew I didn\u2019t own. I contacted the bank straight away and went in to my local branch later in the day. The amount was just over \u00a32000 but a fortune to me! I had no idea where it came from and was never told where it came from or how it came to be in my account. To my horror, they had already notified the police. I got a grilling from a manager, who was really quite nasty to me, ALL my accounts were immediately frozen, I had no money to buy food or pay bills. It was 5 days before a new current account was opened for me and several more days before I got new cards. During that time I was charged for direct debits that had not been actioned including my mortgage which was at the same bank! I also had a home visit from the police. At least it was a plain clothes officer who was considerably more polite than the bank who were very accusatory and treated me as guilty of something that was never actually defined. I later complained to the bank\u2019s head office and a month or two later I did get a written apology and \u00a350 as compensation for the way I\u2019d been treated and the direct debit return charges were refunded. That was the Halifax. I should have closed my account right then because a few years later, I was subjected to their shitty treatment again over something different that was not my fault either. That time I did close my account. I think there have been some agreements within the banking industry about how they should treat innocent customers since, because with an increase in money laundering and online fraud, it has become a more common occurrence and there were a lot of complaints about banks treating people like criminals before any investigation. I do know this. If you were to move even 1 penny of that money to a different account, you could be guilty of an offence, depending on where you live and banking laws and policies. If you know it isn\u2019t yours, leave it alone. Ask for the bank\u2019s help and they SHOULD be friendly about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly I would deposit the million dollars into my nearest bank and then transfer the $1 million in its entirety in multiple high interest online savings account like Ally or Betterment and i would wait for a week not touching the money and just going about daily life and get used to the miracle that i\u2019m worth a million bucks but i ain\u2019t doing nothing with it. $1,000,000. After a week or something, i would start to make my moves. I would get in touch with a Financial Advisor and get some idea about my options of where to invest my money. If he/she backs my ideas, i would invest $300,000 into three different Vanguard Index Funds, and i would leave it there to grow for decades. $700,000 left. I would put some money into stocks of Big and more importantly, stable companies, established giants like Coca Cola, Apple, GEICO, Bank Of America and JP Morgan. Let\u2019s say about $250,000 just to get some skin in the game. $450,000 left. Next i would try to break into the Real Estate game which has been a great way to get grow wealth for some centuries now. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) would be an attractive option to me, let's say $50,000. And for actual properties, i would look for duplexes or small apartment buildings/complexes, take 30 year mortgages on them and set aside $300,000 as deposits and a safety net. I would hire a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and form a team to help me identify and buy good properties that i can rent to tenants for cashflow. $100,000 left. I would leave $60,000 in different online savings accounts to accumulate enough interest to outpace inflation and i would not touch this money ever. $30,000 will be deposited in a savings account of a bank, and $10,000 in a checkings account for my personal use. ( Warning, extremely optimistic numbers!) So, assuming an annual 7% appreciation of the stock market, my three Index Funds should earn about $21,000 per year, maybe $15,000 a year in dividends from the blue chip stocks, 10% return on the REITS would mean $5,000 a year, $1,500 monthly rent from each apartment or $2,000 for duplexes, and of course a 1.25% interest rate by Allybank means i would earn $750 a year in interest before inflation. Basically, my main goal would be to grow the $1,000,000 by diversifying my investments into Index Funds, Blue chip stocks, REITS, Real Estate and Online Savings accounts. Not a single cent would go to cars or any other crap lottery winners buy that gets them broke. (How realistic are my chances of actually growing the money? Feel free to leave a comment :) ",
