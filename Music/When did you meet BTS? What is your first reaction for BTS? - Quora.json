I got to know about their existence in 2016 (idk wtf i was doing before that) and was instantaneously attracted to them like without having any negative thoughts which I thank myself for. Although my bias prolly changed every second cause i didn\u2019t know who was who and everyone\u2019s so amazing. That was my initial reaction and might I add, I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m a full time army and I\u2019m so grateful and honoured to be a part of this amazing fam. stay safe y\u2019alls ~zak  (the picture\u2019s not mine :) ",
