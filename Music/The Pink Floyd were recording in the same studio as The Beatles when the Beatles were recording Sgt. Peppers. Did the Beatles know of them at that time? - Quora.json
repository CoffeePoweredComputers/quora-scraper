That year, he became a producer in his own right, and the first group he was assigned was Pink Floyd. During the Sgt Pepper sessions, Pink Floyd was recording in an adjacent studio, and Smith brought them over to meet the Beatles. It is not known what either band had to say to each other. ",

I have heard that the Beatles essentially ignored Pink Floyd who were in awe of them. I can see that. Paul and George were perfectionists who were without their manager and driven to make an album. Not sure I\u2019d give an up and coming band my attention either. ",
