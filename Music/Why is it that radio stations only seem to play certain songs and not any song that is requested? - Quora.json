            "answer_text": "My show, Transatlantic Conversations, is on a community radio station Celtic Music Radio 95FM and, subject to national guidelines, I can play anything I want. If it fits my show\u2019s parameters - traditional and acoustic-based music from both sides of the Atlantic, and is of good quality, then I\u2019ll probably play any request. Generally, my stuff is based in folk, bluegrass, oldtime, Celtic. Commercial stations and the various BBC channels generally have a station or owner decided playlist. Some specialist programmes will take requests, but most have to follow the playlist. If you\u2019re looking for radio exposure, best to find community stations (not the commercial ones which are mainly owned by the same few companies) that have shows playing your type of music and send them some sample mp3s - preferably direct to the presenter if you have her/his email. If they really like it, they\u2019ll probably ask for more and play it. Most specialist presenters are always on the lookout for new and interesting material. IMPORTANT!!!: But PLEASE get it peer-reviewed by other players and writers first and ask them, \u201cDo you think this is really suitable/good enough for radio play? Be absolutely honest with me. I can take criticism!\u201d We tend to get a lot of stuff from people whose friends, who don\u2019t want to seem critical, tell them it\u2019s GREAT and it ISN\u2019T! I hate having to turn people down, so make sure your material is suitable for the show, well-played, well-written, and well-recorded before sending it in. If you\u2019re trying to promote your musical career, it\u2019s essential that you have a good, frequently updated and added-to, website (it\u2019s worth paying for your own, easily recognisable and remembered domain name), and a Facebook and Twitter presence with lots of followers and people you follow. If your recordings are home-made, get a decent condenser mic - the Rode N1A is excellent value, and a good interface - Focusrite are my preferred brand. There\u2019s an absolutely BRILLIANT deal here that gives you all the hardware you need for \u00a3259 or \u00a37.30/month: Rode NT1-A Vocal Recording Pack With Focusrite 2i2 Interface, Stand at Gear4music It\u2019s also essential that your tracks have some kind of mastering. I only use online mastering to make demos to give me an idea of how my tracks will sound once a pro engineer has done the job. However, for small ensemble or solo work, LANDR: Creative Tools for Musicians do a job that\u2019s not bad - they give you a choice of three mastering levels to help you pick the best sound. Their high level Mp3s are good enough for anything short of an album pressing - if your mix is REALLY good, you could probably use them for that too. Get the best possible mix you can with your DAW program (I use Reaper Audio Production Without Limits - they charge only $60 for a program that is, in my highly experienced opinion, just as good as any of the major company products - it will also create a burnable CD image of your work if you just want to run off a few CDs at a time). Use your EQ plugins (Reaper comes with plenty - so does Focusrite) to roll off the bass overall below about 60Hz. Roll off as much of the bass as you can from your vocals without affecting what you hear - you should be able to remove 100 - 130 Hz and below depending on your voice - that\u2019ll give any lower instrument notes a bit of space. The Reaper EQ has some good vocal pre-sets, but I\u2019d still roll a bit more off. Use a bit of compression - not too much - to make your voice cut through. And experiment with how widely you can pan your instruments to get decent separation - but leave drums and bass near the centre - maybe 10% right for one and left for the other? Overall, add a touch of reverb - not too much - and the Stereowidth plugin that comes with Reaper helps boost your sound and separation. Once you get as good a mix as you can, render it to a .wav file - leaving around 4 - 6 db of \u201cair\u201d on your mix (ie space below 0dB) - and get it mastered either by an engineer or load it up to Landr. Make sure you, and someone else with a good ear, like the final product before sending it to a show! I hope this helps! ",
