            "answer_text": "Reverb does have an Echo component. Actually depending on the type of Reverb, maybe dozens of tiny Echo components. Think of Reverb as being like dozens of ping-pong balls dropped out of a box from a rooftop into an alley. Once they hit the ground and start bouncing, they\u2019ll collide off the walls of the alley and each other, changing direction randomly, and eventually settling one by one. Quite chaotic. This is what sound does. It bounces of any hard surface, returns, hits another hard surface, bounces back, etc., until it finally fades out. But generally, the first reflection happens in a fairly short time. Often Reverb units are designed to emulate small rooms, large rooms, halls and cathedrals. So for a small room, it\u2019s a very short time. For a enormous cathedral, the first reflection could almost sound like an Echo. But it\u2019s quickly buried and confused by all the subsequent reflections, which are quieter and also generally less bright sounding. Echo on the other hand, tends to be a longer, clearer reflection. Like what you hear if you shout into a canyon. The main differences being the enormity of the canyon and it\u2019s lack of side walls. Yes you\u2019ll hear subsequent reflections, but they will be at a lower volume and less \u201ccluttered\u201d. Think of Echo as being more like a single ping-pong ball. Typically what you\u2019d call Echo in audio recordings, is usually created by a Delay unit. Most Delay units have a \u201cDelay Time\u201d control that can be adjusted between a very short delay, sounding similar to Reverb (but less random and cluttered, giving it a \u201cmetallic\u201d sound), to long enough that a musician can play a harmony over a melody (even one lasting several bars) that they just finished playing. So very long even for an Echo. Also, Delay units have a \u201cfeedback\u201d control. At the zero setting, there is only one repeat. At maximum, the repeats stack up on each other and blur. At this setting, they may swell into a very loud, very chaotic sound. This can often be a useful effect, but it lacks the pleasant and natural tonality of a Reverb, which sounds like reflections in a room. ",

            "answer_text": "Echo is a distinct repetition of the original sound, crisp and clean. A double echo would be two repetitions of the original sound, crisp and clean, which repetitions must be at different times, in order to discern them as two discrete repetitions. An echo can be triple, quadruple, etc, it all depends on the physical characteristics of the structure or structures responsible for reflecting back the original sound. Reverb is a particular case of echo, in which the repetition is not only multiple, but overlapped. It occurs when the structure reflecting back the sound cover a very wide angle from the sound source, thus the reflection is smeared in time. This is, the closest point of the reflecting structure will reflect, and points further away will reflect, but later, and so on with increasing distances between source and reflection. It is usual to have various reflecting surfaces covering wide angles, the multiple reflections coming from various directions. This usually implies a closed space, in which the reflected sound bounces and re-bounces from all points of all reflecting structures. Not all enclosed spaces create reverb. In many places there are \u201csecret rooms\u201d to be found, which are rooms with reflecting structures so positioned as to reflect, that is, echo the sound from a source to a point far away. From that point far away the original sound can be heard at a volume which is abnormal at such a distance. Other structures are able to discriminate different frequency through the standing wave phenomenom. This effect is noticeable while walking between two high walls with no roof, as would be between two buildings, which walls must be very long, very tall, and no more than some three feet apart. The steps will resound with a particular ring, and if singing is attempted it will be noticed that some notes sound very full, and some others seem to fall into a hole. The effect is that of a comb filter. But I wander\u2026\u2026 Echo is basically one repetition of the original sound. Reverb is uncountable multiple repetitions of the original sound, which create a spongy mush of noise, eventually decaying. Some amount of reverb is necessary for pleasurable listening of music. Excessive reverb can render sylabic speech impossible to be understood, but can nonetheless be enjoyable in some sorts of music. ",
