            "answer_text": "Different people have different opinions about this. I owned a Kawai grand piano. Before buying it, I read about different pianos, their resale values, their sound, their durability, etc. I did not plan on buying a grand piano, but I encountered a deal too good to pass up. No regrets! I loved it. However, unless you encounter a deal too good to pass up, I would recommend a Yamaha in an upright. They are very good pianos. The action feels great. The sound is beautiful. They have a deservedly good reputation, and you should get a good price for it if you decide to sell it (although I hope you can keep it for life). A Steinway upright is an excellent piano, but unless you feel certain you would keep it all your life (I sold my grand piano when I moved from a house to an apartment), you may have trouble justifying the price. But if you keep it all your life, the cost per year may not be that much considering the pleasure it provides. Best wishes, and keep enjoying the piano! ",
