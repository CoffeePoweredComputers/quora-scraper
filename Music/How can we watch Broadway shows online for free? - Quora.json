            "answer_text": "YouTube has some shows that you can watch for free but definitely not all of them. This is as far as you will get with \u201cfree\u201d solutions but there are some workarounds that you can try as well. Since Netflix has some stage musicals available on their streaming platform you can use the 15-day trial and watch them during that period. You can do the same with other streaming platforms like Hulu, Fandango, and others. If you need more ideas, I am sure this guide can help you out. ",

Or if you have Amazon Prime, BroadwayHD offers a free week trial for their Amazon channel. Also check Tumblr, someone somewhere has probably posted the video on there. ",

Sometimes, right after PBS has shown a Great Performances episode, the episode might be free for about a week after it was shown on TV to watch online, but eventually that too is locked. ",
