            "answer_text": "There are several strange things in the African culture and one can find them disturbing. Masai We all know the Masai are the Samson of the Bible, famous for killing lions with just a spear. :-P The Masai men used to sleep with young Masai girls and according to their culture the girls were not supposed to get pregnant before marriage. What do you expect? Of course they did get pregnant and were forced to the most gruesome abortion ever. The pregnant girls were forced to lie down facing upwards then one to two women walked on top of their belly till they bled out the embryo from their vagina. Most girls died and a few survived. Those who died were thought to be evil and they didn't moan their death except mostly for a few mothers who understood the pain their child was going through. This is one of the worst cultural practices that I'm glad is extinct. 2. Akamba  The Kamba girls used to be abducted by older men for marriage. In this culture like most African cultures women didn't have a voice. When an elderly man noticed a hard working girl that fetches firewood and water in time they would send a group of young men to abduct her. From then on she should be a hardworking wife, age difference was not an issue and sometimes the age gap was overwhelmingly high. Imagine a 60yr old man marrying an 18 yr old. My grandmother was almost abducted but she escaped narrowly. Witchcraft I find witchcraft strange. People have eaten grass like cows, barked like dogs stuck on trees because of stealing fruits, given birth to snakes etc I'm an atheist but I wonder how do these things happen? I have no proof I mostly hear from the media or personal stories and just wonder what the heck!! I  I'll appreciate any grammatical corrections!! ",
