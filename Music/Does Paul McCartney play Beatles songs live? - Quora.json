            "answer_text": "Yes, and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to see him twice, in 2002 and 2011. In the 2011 concert I was at, he performed the entire Abbey Road suite, moving from drums to keyboards to bass to lead guitar during the sequence. I\u2019m very glad my son (who was 11 then) and I had the chance to experience that. At age 69, McCartney never stopped for over three hours. I don\u2019t think he even paused to take a sip of water. He is incredible. ",
