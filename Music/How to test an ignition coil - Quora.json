            "answer_text": "Usually a coil is either working or its not. When they fail, it\u2019s usually a complete failure. This means the engine will not run at all. Is the engine runs but idles very rough, it\u2019s not the ignition coil, but could be a bad spark plug wire or spark plug. If your car has a coil with a single wire that goes to a distributor, the test can be pretty easy. There are probably other ways to do this, but I\u2019m going to give you the quick and super easy way to check but will caution you not to touch the screwdriver or you will get zapped. Unplug the wire from the coil that goes to the center of the distributor. Take a Phillips head screwdriver And put it into the wire. Hold the screwdriver shaft about 1/8 to 1/4 inch from any bare metal part on the engine. Have someone crank the engine over for a couple of seconds while you look for a spark from the screwdriver shaft to the bare metal. If you have spark you know that the coil is working, of course it will not tell you how well it\u2019s working. Pretty basic, I know - there is more you can do troubleshooting, but to your specific question, that\u2019s the answer ",

            "answer_text": "In the old days, you would remove the plug wire from the plug and set the wire end near the engine, start the motor and you can see the arc. I test spark ignitors on gas appliances by placing a clamp type amp meter around the wire. If there is an arc, it will use current and get detected by the meter. With coil on plug you can switch them and see if it now misfires a different cylinder. Just for fun, you can have someone pee on a plug wire with the engine running. ",
