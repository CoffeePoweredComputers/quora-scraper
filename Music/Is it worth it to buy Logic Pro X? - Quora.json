            "answer_text": "You can read my related answer here: What is the best DAW on the market right now?\nBut, the answer to this questions depends on you.  Ideally, you want to buy a program that you are comfortable with and a program that allows you to create anything that comes to your imagination. There are many programs out there that can accomplish this, depending on your tastes, but for me Logic Pro X is that program.  Let me make my case: Logic Pro X only costs $200. That's a very competitive price for all the features it holds. Apple (the owners of Logic Pro X) acquired Alchemy from Camel Audio. The Alchemy plugin alone used to be sold for $250. They could have updated Logic Pro to a new version and charge a premium fee, but when they updated Logic Pro X with Alchemy, the update was FREE. Months prior to releasing Alchemy, the Logic Pro team let out a massive free update as well.Logic Pro X's $200 price tag makes it one of the cheapest, (if not the cheapest), industry standard programs available. Logic Pro X is one of the applications that gives you the MOST \"bang\" for your buck. Compare it with the prices of FL Studio, Cubase or Ableton. Logic Pro X is a steal! Logic Pro X allows you to get stuff done right out-of-the-box. Their Orchestra and \"real\" instruments are adequate but can sound more realistic. Their newer drums are pretty well-made and so are their synths. With Alchemy, you can basically make any instrument that comes to your mind... Logic Pro X is also equipped with other stock plugins that allows you to shape the sound of the available instruments or create ones that are totally unique. Logic Pro X's built-in mixing and mastering plugins are pretty well-made too. Unlike some of the applications you come across, you can count on a lot of the stock plugins, and instruments available in Logic Pro X. If you don't like the plugins or instruments, you can find 3rd party plugins/instruments for the ones you are not satisfied with.You can find out more here: Logic Pro X - Music production. Cranked up to X.At the end of the day, it does not matter what application you buy. You can make hits in Garageband! The famous saying is, \"it's the DAW, not the user.\" Logic Pro X (or any application you choose) can provide you the tools, but will you be able to utilize those tools to their best potential? If you try Logic Pro X and your answer is yes, then Logic Pro X was worth your buy. I can't speak for others, but it was worth my buy. ",

            "answer_text": "I started on Logic probably 15 years ago, when they were still Emagic, and had a PC version. At the time I paid 500 bucks for the \u201csilver\u201d version (the \u201cgold\u201d and \u201cplatinum\u201d were more expensive), and 250 dollars extra for the ES-2. When Space Designer came out it was an extra 800 (?) dollars. A full Logic package would be over 2000 dollars. Apple has been at the same time increasing the functionality and lowering the price ever since. Right now Logic is the most incredible value for money. The only question is whether it has the right workflow for you. It seems Live is better if you do loop-based stuff, but apparently it\u2019s not great for recording live instruments. Logic is really bad at scores. If you need to write out your parts, get a score program with a good orchestral library. I have no experience with other DAWs, so I can\u2019t help you any further. Do your own research. ",
