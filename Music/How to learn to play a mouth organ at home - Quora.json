            "answer_text": "There two options for starting. Choose what kind of harmonica you want to use. A chromatic harmonica has all the notes of any music scale therefore you can play anything providing you have the determination to succeed. Non-chromatic harmonicas are usually made to different keys. Ex: C major, D major etc. There are blues harmonicas (traditionally called blues harps) which are crafted to let the player bend the reeds to get that high lonesome wailing sound. (my favorite). Find a guitar or piano playing friend to help you find your groove and jam a lot. It\u2019ll come to you. P.S. dragging a wood and metal object over your lips takes a bit of getting used to, so be careful. Good luck. ",

Aside from that, the easiest is going to be working form YouTube videos, if you have access to YouTube. Adam Gussow, Tomlin Leckie, JP Allen are great to start with, but there are many more. Play along with music; record yourself and listen to the recording to see if you can spot problems (this also allows you to keep track of your progress). Listen to a lot of the masters. Good luck! ",
