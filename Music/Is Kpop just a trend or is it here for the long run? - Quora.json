            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Sania Islam Anyway, KPop is not just a 'trend', as you called it. It is a genre in music, like with JPop or CPop or even American Pop. It might seem like a trend to you, because it is hugely popular right now thanks to groups like Twice, BTS, and EXO. So yeah, I think your question needs a little bit of rephrasing. I am not the most hardcore KPop fan there is, but I do know that KPop has been around for a long time. H.O.T, Fin.K.L, and SES are some of the biggest groups back in the day. Then there is Park Jinyoung, who is a pretty big pop artist. Let's also not forget Rain, Mina (Answer the Phone, anyone?) and Boa. No matter how much people claim KPop is just the \u201csame\", I guarantee you that each artist is different, whether group or solo. For example in girl groups, Sistar, Rainbow BLAXX, and AOA have sexy concepts while SNSD, After School, and Twice are more on bubblegum pop. Mamamoo has some jazz-ish tracks and Crayon Pop is kind of weird and cute. Everybody has a different concept, target audience, and performances. I hope I made sense. Okay tldr: KPop will be around for a long time, and it is not just a trend. Maybe the hype will calm down but KPop will not disappear. Again, I hope I made sense. ",

            "answer_text": "Just a \u2018trend\u2019? It\u2019s a label for pop music coming from a specific country, not just a basic fad! Would you ask if American pop is just a trend? Idol groups first began cropping up during the 1990\u2019s, which was also a pretty big time for cheesy pop music in the rest of the world. British pop music was, uh\u2026 questionable during this time, but popular. Take That, Boyzone, the Spice Girls\u2026 Maybe someone might say \u2018but Amy! English-language pop music isn\u2019t like that anymore!\u2019 Yeah, music changes. Kpop isn\u2019t what it used to be like, either.  (From the early 2000\u2019s. I see no difference between that and British/American pop from the same time period! Man, this song is still so good, though.)  (Something from late last year, for comparison. What a bop.) It develops, it grows. What is being viewed as \u2018Kpop\u2019 now, isn\u2019t what people were viewing as \u2018Kpop\u2019 when Gangnam Style had its few minutes of fame. And what people think it is now is still only the surface of an entire genre. Groups differ, songs differ, concepts differ. There are groups which are more like Khiphop (some of BigBang, or maybe Block B), others are closer to bubblegum pop (Orange Caramel, perhaps?). Others are more mature (like Gain\u2019s music), or maybe leaning towards the trot or pop rock genres (some of M&D\u2019s songs). As a general rule, people like to listen to music they can understand. That\u2019s fine, and normal. But, we\u2019re getting more open about that over in the west, now \u2014 songs in Spanish have been popular, for example, from the likes of Shakira. And I think that the more open we get, and the easier it becomes to look up the translations of lyrics online, or see music videos, keep up with music groups, learn languages and find out about other cultures, buy albums and merchandise\u2026 the more music in other languages will spread, and get the recognition it deserves to have. I expect the hype will calm down. It\u2019s new to a lot of people. It\u2019s become the new thing to react to Kpop MVs online. A lot of people were introduced to the genre (or given a doorway into it) by BTS on the AMA\u2019s, and with their surrounding interviews (Ellen, James Corden, etc). So the Kpop trend is a trend. The Kpop genre has been, and will be here for the long run. ",
