            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends mostly upon the period in which the music was written. Until the nineteenth century, the difference was mostly in the music\u2019s lyrics. Composers like Bach and (later) Mozart used the same musical techniques for sacred and secular pieces, and audiences didn\u2019t expect to encounter much of a distinction between the two. For instance, the vocal solos in Bach cantatas largely follow operatic forms of the day. Throughout the 1800s one can notice a divide between sacred and secular compositions for a number of reasons. One large reason, however, was that churches became less important as musical patrons during this period. Also, the rising importance of the middle class created more opportunities for secular musical patronage. Few of the great Romantic composers were all that interested in writing sacred music steadily, and most of their great sacred pieces were heard in concert\u2014not liturgical\u2014settings because of their length and grandiosity. (Think of Beethoven\u2019s Missa Solemnis, Berlioz\u2019 and Verdi\u2019s Requiem settings, and Brahms\u2019 Ein Deutsches Requiem.) By the mid 1800s, the money in composing was to be found in the opera house and concert hall. Music heard in worship can do one of two things. It can try to remove listeners from the outside world in an attempt to help them concentrate on the eternal nature of God and God\u2019s teachings. Or it can try to make a direct connection with listeners by sounding exactly like the music they listen to during the rest of their week, thus making music more of a \u201chook\u201d which will make listeners more receptive to the rest of the worship service. Back in the 1960s a \u201ccontemporary worship music\u201d movement had its beginnings in Great Britain, eventually spreading to North America. Some churches embraced the trend while others resisted it. Today\u2019s \u201cblended\u201d worship involves a type of worship planning which includes both approaches. Although it would appear to be a nice compromise, blended worship can be very difficult to design successfully because these two approaches to music as worship require fundamentally different kinds of musical experiences which clash when placed in close proximity to one another. The truly sad thing about this occurs when churchgoers decide one approach alone is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Inevitably this leads to insults being hurled against those who favor the other way in which music can function in worship. I suppose musicians like Handel, who in the early 17000s rescored some of his most successful secular pieces for his later (sacred) oratorios, must chuckle when looking down at the gravity we assign to this conflict today.

            "answer_text": "Audrey had a great answer. Another use did not. Sacred music and secular music are not interchangable like the \"world\" is trying to do today. First off, music is a gift from God and it was meant specifically to glorify Him. Music has three main parts: Melody, Harmony, and Rythmn. Our bodies have three parts as well: mind, body, and soul. Each part of music matches these. The main difference between sacred and secular music is that sacred music first speaks to the soul glorifying/praising God. Secular music first speaks to the body. This is why you cannot simply take good lyrics and put them with secular music and expect to glorify God. Compare a sacred hymn with a contemporary \"Christian\" song (I know not all contemporary is wrong obviously) and see which one moves the body and which one moves the spirit. We have all seen dancing baby's wiggling to a strong beat. This is natural as it's thier flesh moving, just as it should be natural for a Christian to sing/listen to music that first glorifies God.
