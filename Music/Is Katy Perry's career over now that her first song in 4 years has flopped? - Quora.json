            "answer_text": "Maybe and no. WHY NO? Katy Perry has a HUGE back catalogue of hits. She can make $10s of millions of dollars a year in TOURING REVENUE for pretty much the rest of her life as a legacy artist, even if she never gets another radio spin PERIOD.WHY MAYBE? Technically, Katy Perry has actually now had about 4\u20137 flops in a row, depending on how you count. Since \u201cDark Horse\u201d pretty much every single has performed worse than the last.Her current album is easily the biggest fall from grace since Lady Gaga\u2019s Artpop era, which ironically started with negative comparisons to Katy Perry\u2019s #1 hit \u201cRoar.\u201d See my answer to a related question here: Peter Daines's answer to Did Katy Perry's latest album Witness flop both critically and commercially?Her 3 most recent singles are easily the 3 worst performing in her entire career by a mile. They have all peaked below #200 in overall radio airplay per All your music data needs in one place (billboard doesn\u2019t report on radio airplay for songs that don\u2019t chart, and also generally doesn\u2019t release actual numbers; NOTE: kworb.net radio numbers actually come from Mediabase, which is a very reputable organization).KP\u2019s label dumped a LOT of money on her recent music videos & they got a LOT of views. It\u2019s possible that they aren\u2019t done dumping money into her career & that gives her hope for a high production comeback with her next album. But for now, KP\u2019s name on a song is actually kindof toxic.",
