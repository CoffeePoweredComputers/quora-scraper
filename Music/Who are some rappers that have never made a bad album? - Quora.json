            "answer_text": "The Notorious B.I.G. only made two albums. Sadly he got killed shortly before his second album released. Ready To Die is the first album, and it is a classic.  Most of the album is gangsta rap. But there were some lighter songs like Juicy and Big Poppa that helped this album sell way better than other great East Coast rap albums from around the same time.  Shortly after Biggie recorded his second album, he was killed in a drive-by shooting. 2 weeks later, we got Life After Death.  Like the first album, Life After Death is a mix of gangsta rap and party music. There was more of a mafioso theme this time around, and several references to beef with Tupac, Nas, and a couple Wu-Tang Clan members.  There is some posthumous material that\u2019s more hit-and-miss than the two studio albums, but I don\u2019t count them. Biggie had no say in their release. Both of the albums he did record and intend to release were good albums, and it\u2019s sad to think of what more he could have done if he wasn\u2019t killed only a few years into his career. R.I.P. Biggie Smalls, one of the best rappers of the 90s. ",
