So many days sets are bind to be interesting once someone had spent some time with them. At a glance the one I find most interesting every time is the NYC taxi data. It's literally the start and stop points of every fare in the city. The billion plus points let's you take some very simple segment details and start discovering complex things about a city. Just plotting the points produces this wonderful map.  Then doing some simple binning and histograms you can start to see how the city operates without any prior knowledge. The business centers appear, the airport lights up like a beacon. With a little more processing you can start to identify other types of businesses and determine the times and demographics of their customers. In a few cases you can pick out individual homes and start tracking the peoples travels. The image above comes from this page with a lot of details about working with the data. http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/ ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cInteresting\u201d and \u201cmost interesting\u201d are extremely subjective terms. What is of interest to someone, might be not so much (or not at all) to somebody else. Having said that, check this large meta-repository Datasets for Data Mining and Data Science as well as links in my answers Aleksandr Blekh's answer to What are interesting open data projects in data analysis or science? and Where can I find free spatio-temporal dataset for download?. Also, if you use Amazon Web Services (AWS), check AWS Public Dataset Program. If you use Google Cloud Platform (GCP), check Public Datasets - Access and Analyze Data  |  Google Cloud. Some other potentially interesting public datasets are listed on this Azure documentation page: Public data sets for Azure analytics (though note they are not hosted on Azure). And this is just the tip of the public datasets iceberg. Hope this helps. Good luck! ",
