            "answer_text": "It's a very recent song, and yes, it is Deathgrind, but if you can push through and understand the lyrics, behind the amazing riffs and melodies, I can't describe just how much hatred for humanity Cattle Decapitation put into their song, Manufactured Extinct. A lot of artists use very subtle hints and cues to exemplify their feelings. Cattle Decapitation, on the other hand, gone all out in their effort to write the most hateful, depressing, and saddening piece of art I've ever heard. The song comes from their upcoming album, The Anthropocene Extinction, which, if I remember Geography lessons correctly, means the Global extinction as caused by human actions and pollution and destruction of the environment.  If this doesn't make you either instantly depressed or hate humanity or a combination of the above, then you probably need to see a doctor. Enjoy.  Here are the lyrics, for your reading (dis)pleasure:   In the beginning of this, the Anthropocene era Life was pristine, resonating impact \u2026the instigator\u2019s arrival Densely populating smashing biodiversity  Altered climate accelerating exacerbated by our human activities We used it up, we wore it out, we made it do what we could have done without  Machines to make machines fabricating the end of all living things Sacrificing all morality, the ends never justify the means  Technology defines the ages - our human history burns its own pages  Under the sun and in the light of day we throw this all away Instinctual devotion to annihilation Eradication, mass predation - manufactured extinction The powers that be are you and me  These enemies of inconvenience = undertakers  Entire species erased Millions of acres defaced Nonrenewable  Fuck this flesh Curating distress Composing our dirge True nature emerged  Under the sun and in plain sight a tragedy has been designed by hands of cultures intertwined in greed and cruel ways of life  ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion; Christmas 1915; \u201c1915 on Christmas Day, On the Western Front the gun all died away, Lying in the mud on bags of sand, We heard a soldier sing from No-Mans Land. He had a tenors voice so pure and true, The words were strange but every note we knew, Soaring o\u2019er the living dead and damned, A German sang of peace in No-Mans Land. Silent Night, No canons roar, A king is born of peace forever more, All calm, All quiet, All brothers arm in arm, In 19 and 15 in No-Mans Land. They left their trenches, We left ours, Beneath tin hats the smiles bloomed like wild flowers, With photos, ciggarettes and tots of wine, We built a soldiers truce on the Front Line. The singer was a lad of 21, We begged another song before the dawn, And there amid the mud and blood and fear, We heard again that song all longed to hear, Silent night, No canons roared, A king is born of peace forever more, All is calm, All quiet, All brothers arm in arm, Amid gas and rusty wire in No-Mans land. In the morning all the guns boomed in the rain, They shot us and we shot them again, With bullet bomb bayonet gas and flame, With neither us or them at all to blame. There was heavy fighting right throughout the day, For one nights peace we bloodily did pay, That night they charged, We fought them hand to hand, I killed the boy who sang in No-Mans land. Silent Night, No canons roar, A king is born of peace forever more, All calm all quiet, All brothers arm in arm, And that young soldier sings, The sound of peace still rings, Where the captains and the kings, Built NO-Mans land. Sleep in heavenly peace\u201d ",
