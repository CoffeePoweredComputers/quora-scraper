            "answer_text": "Your question implies that someting is wrong (bad), therefore you measured it against an ideal that is called right (good). That means you already measured and know what is not in your understanding of good, which means you know exactly what the answer is. For interest sake. Are you measuring Cambodia against another country, like India, China, Laos, USA, Switzerland, Central African Republic? What is the \u201cright\u201d country in your measure? For me, Cambodia is what it is. I learn to live with it. She teaches me her changing ways and I enjoy her. Soon she will change and become more developed. People will think they have prosperity, but they will only get more of that which creates the high levels of mental and personality problems found in developed countries. Cambodia is what she is, and she offers more opportunities than any country that I know. It will be outsiders come in to make use of the opportunities. Its how life is. Locals often dont see the opportunities. ",
