            "answer_text": "Congratulations, writing songs is an incredibly valuable and worthwhile achievement, if they reach people and create an emotional response. Have you discovered that your songs are liked by people? What types of songs do you write, what genre/s do they occupy? Have you published performances of your songs to enable people to experience them? A song is only of value, in harsh practical terms if the song provokes a response. It does not matter how good you think they are! You obviously intend to present your music, your songs to an audience, yes? I ask you these questions, not to \u2018troll\u2019 you, or to upset you, I think it is important to look at your situation in very practical terms, I think the work you have already performed demands this level of respect, yes? You say you have written a lot of songs, this is not, in itself the important part of the equation. So, the first objective for a songwriter is to present their songs to the right people. This might sound a bit strange, but say, if a group of heavy metal fans, who love head-banging big sounds were to listen to a folk song, say of the type that Ed Sheeren writes, what would be their response do you think, would they like it, appreciate the nuances? Nope, chances are not! Matching our music to the correct audience, this is the art and science of music marketing. Marketing is not a dirty word, in musical terms it simply refers to the process of identifying \u2018who\u2019 will like your music. Entire careers have been forged from one, or two songs they can be that powerful.* The next step for a songwriter, such as yourself is to reach out and discover who your audience is. The world of music today is a very complex, polarized one. We have different communities, and factions. We have the \u2018Hip Hop\u2019 ultra commercial industry, where image and street-cred have been distilled into a sales pitch. We have the Rappers, word smiths and attitude builders. We have the Rock, Blues, Progressive fusion communities. We have the singer-songwriter, acoustic guitar and beautiful love ballads, the political commentators, the unique personality communities. Your task is to identify who your people are, where are your songs going to find their home? Music culture is not monolithic, it is not just one thing, or what the mainstream industry claims it is. The world of talent contests, of television judges, of delirious audiences is an artificial one. The real music culture is out here, in suburbia, in towns and cities, villages and communities, people are waiting to hear their music, the music which speaks to them, comforts them, allows their dreams to take flight, music which will provide the magic fuel for the next cultural movement, for the way forward. Go through your songs, sort them into categories, be ruthless, get to know your songs and discover just where they can fit-in with real people, build your own audience, create your culture. Music, songs are a special form of communication, and all communication requires listening, and responding to. Set up a YouTube channel, set up an artist page on Facebook, on other social media channels. Build your catalog of songs, different versions of them, film performances in people\u2019s lounge rooms, in kitchens, they do not have to be slick, \u2018professional\u2019 productions, they have to reveal the innate qualities of your songs, and to allow people to engage with them. Present, perform, reveal, discuss, re-iterate, make mistakes, correct them, build vlogs, blogs, put out videos, allow others to perform your songs, get your music out to the people who will love your songs. *I make the claim that entire careers have been made possible from one, or two songs, we can describe this if we make a short list, and match each name with one, or two songs: The Beatles - \u2018She Loves You (yeah, yeah, yeah).Glen Campbell - Witchita Linesman/GalvestonCreedence Clearwater Revival - Proud Mary/Fortunate SonFrank Sinatra - \u2018All the way\u2019-\u2019My Way\u2019R.E.M - Losing my ReligionNeil Young - Heart of GoldPeter Frampton - Do you feel like we do? (the whole album \u2018Frampton Comes Alive\u2019 I guess, one album launched decades of success).Chuck Berry - Johnny B. GoodeThe Rolling Stones - Satisfaction/Jumping Jack FlashKate Bush - Wuthering HeightsSo we have the phenomenon of one song capturing the imagination of a great many people, which opens the door to being heard.

            "answer_text": "As a songwriter, you write songs all the time. But if you don\u2019t take those songs out of your \u201cbedroom bubble\u201d you will never get to see if they work in front of the audience. You need to get feedback on your songs to learn how to write better songs, and often time family and friends are not the best people for this. Go to a local singer songwriter night and perform your songs in front of a live audience. Set up a camera in the room or get a friend to film your performance. Even better if they can also film the audience response. Study back what works and what does not. Work on it, make it better. And repeat the process. As a singer I can tell you there is nothing better to improve your vocals than singing a one thousand shows. I know this sounds crazy, but to become a truly engaging performer is a craft and it takes time. The number of songs you have written does not mean much, but the experience helps. How good your songs are is something you don\u2019t decide, the market decides. And you will never find out until you put your songs in front of people. ",
