            "answer_text": "\u201cI got white folk money that I won\u2019t blow. If you ask me why, \u2018cuz the white folk don\u2019t.\u201d AAAHHH lol I was so fucking stoked when I heard this line. I\u2019ve heard hip-hop songs since about 2002 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve EVERRR heard anyone in that genre praise the idea of saving money instead of buying a ton of shit. \u201cIf you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen.\u201d I know it doesn\u2019t seem like the craziest lyric, but it\u2019s more of the song as a whole that\u2019s awesome. This is just said something at the end because I didn\u2019t know which line I wanted to put on here. Gotta love my man Logic. (So I wrote this answer this morning/afternoon\u2026 It\u2019s late night and I just happened to run across a comment of mine on one of his songs 5 years ago\u2026 Have to share because it\u2019s so fucking cool lol. Never sold out. Ugh. <3)  \u201cHow much money you got? (A lot) How much money you got? (A lot) How much money you got? (A lot) How many problems you got? (A lot) How many people done doubted you? (A lot) Left you out to rot? (A lot) How many lawyers you got? (A lot) How many times you got shot? (A lot)\u201d When I first heard this song I was like oh lord, another song fronting about how much money someone has\u2026 Rolls eyes. As soon as he started twisting it and talking about whether or not it was worth it to get to the top, it commanded my respect. \u201cBut bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong wayBut she think she a bitch, what a double entendre.\u201d Was sooo hard to find one line (or two) instead of entire verse, but finally found one to pull. Adding this song because it\u2019s SOOO good and hopefully at least 3 people watch it lol.  \u201cFifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch.\u201d \u2018Nuff said! XD \u201cMaybe these are the momentsMaybe I've been missin' what it's aboutBeen scared of the future, thinkin' about the pastWhile missin' out on now.\u201d That was really fun. Thanks for the question! ",
