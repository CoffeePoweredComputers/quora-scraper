            "answer_text": "Many singers sing live in many venues. I assume you are talking about lip synching (singing along with a recording). The absence of a live accompaniment is often a reason. I once programmed my choir to sing a song from a religious rock opera. I had sung in a performance myself, but they couldn\u2019t do it with me singing from the piano. So, I bought the recording, which included both singing and karaoke tracks. Sung live, but not played live. Acoustical problems in the hall could be another. The great Afro-American star Josephine Baker was rehearsing for her final comeback in Paris. She was in her early seventies. The hall proved to have such bad acoustics, that the entire show was recorded, and the record played back as the performers sang live along with it. A film was going to be made after the opening. The final preview had just been performed. Ms Baker was found dead the morning of opening night. (The recording was released). ",

            "answer_text": "The truly talented ones can. The ones who can\u2019t are completely bs artists who use autotune so heavily on their voices on albums that it puts them on key and pitch even if they have horrible voices. Singing live is the test of any singer. If you can\u2019t do that, then what\u2019s the point? ",
