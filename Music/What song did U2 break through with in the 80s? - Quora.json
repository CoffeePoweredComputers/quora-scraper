            "answer_text": "I was hoping for some clarification about your question\u2014namely, breakthrough where? The world is a big place and lots of countries have radio and sales hit charts! But since I\u2019m not sure what you mean exactly, I\u2019m going to provide a few different answers\u2026 For all of the following answers, I\u2019m looking at both the Peak Chart Position of the single AND the Peak Chart Position of the accompanying album. After all, does a band really \u201cbreak through\u201d because of a stand alone hit single if the rest of the album tanks? Such a band would be considered a \u201cone-hit wonder,\u201d not a breakthrough mega-band. U2 Broke Through the UK in the 80s with \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d from War in 1983. That track was their first Top 10 hit in the UK, while the album hit #1 \u2014 U2\u2019s first number 1 record in the world! While no other single off War cracked the Top 10 in the UK, the follow-up album also went to #1 and both singles (\u201cPride\u201d and the title track, \u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d) charted higher than \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d (#3 and #6, respectively).U2 Broke Through in Ireland in the 80s with \u201cWith or Without You\u201d from The Joshua Tree in 1987. This one is debatable because the fact is U2 had a #4 hit in the charts with a single from their sophomore album, October, way back in 1981; the single being \u201cFire.\u201d And they had 5 more singles in the Top 10 between \u201cFire\u201d and \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d But their first 4 albums did not reflect the band having broken through: Boy = 13, October = 17, War = 16, The Unforgettable Fire = 53. Those numbers suggest that U2\u2019s popularity was flagging from the get-go! But then The Joshua Tree dropped in 1987 at #1 on the Irish charts, and every U2 album since (except for the most recent, Songs of Innocence, which capped off maddeningly at #2) has topped the charts. On top of that, the three lead-off singles from The Joshua Tree (namely, \u201cWith or Without You,\u201d \u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For,\u201d and \u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d) all were #1 hits as well. So I think \u201cWith or Without You\u201d demands to be recognized as U2\u2019s breakthrough album in their own country.Finally, U2 Broke Through in America in the 80s with \u201cWith or Without You\u201d as well. Compared to the UK and Ireland, U2\u2019s first couple of albums barely made a blip on the US charts: Boy peaked at 63, and the follow-up which should have upped the band\u2019s game fell flat and only managed 104. The first single from the band to show up at all in the US was 1983\u2019s \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d the same single which saw U2 become rock stars in the UK but which struggled to make #53 in the States. The next few singles performed even worse, until \u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d did a smidgen better by hitting #33. (SIDE NOTE: Bono\u2019s lyric from \u201cHold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,\u201d includes a line that goes, \u201cThey want you to be Jesus, they go down on one knee, but they want their money back if you\u2019re alive at 33!\u201d) Not all too promising! Still, their albums War and The Unforgettable Fire did show some glimmers of hope as each came close to the Top 10 charts in the US. But could they actually break wide open, or were they going to have to settle for \u201cBiggest Band in Europe?\u201d The answer, of course, is history: The Joshua Tree landed at #1 in America, as did the first 2 singles off the record, kicking off with \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d It\u2019s easy to point to \u201cWith or Without You\u201d and its iconic record as THE band\u2019s breakthrough worldwide, but the whole story is certainly more complex than that. Aside from becoming big in the UK, another huge factor wasn\u2019t a record or a single at all, but a nearly-calamitous live performance at the legendary fundraiser concert, Live Aid (Live Aid). Because of some questionable antics on the part of Bono, their 2-song set (which was supposed to have been a 3-song set) ended up making them stand out in front of a global audience and it probably earned them a million new fans and admirers overnight. Without \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d smashing the charts in the UK in 1983 and Bono rescuing and dancing with a girl in the audience at Live Aid in 1985, who knows if there ever would have been a Joshua Tree album or its massive hits? All is quiet,Ben(o) ",
