            "answer_text": "What's the difference in music between streams vs record sales? The Streaming company pays a tiny fixed sum per stream to the artist.

This is why making an album is no longer a good risk. Unless you\u2019re going to get tens of millions of streams, you\u2019re going to struggle to recover costs. The digital content genie is out of the bottle, and it\u2019s killing off being a creative musician as a career. The streaming companies take massive income - but still, make losses. The artists just get annoyed, and hungry. ",
