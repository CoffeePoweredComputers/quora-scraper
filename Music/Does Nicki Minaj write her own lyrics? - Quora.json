            "answer_text": "She does on most of her albums but with features and singles not so much,it's obvious by the content per song alone. What I do like about her album content is that it is more relatable than songs like \u201cAnaconda\u201d. Listen to her Pinkprint album front to back and you'll get to know the crazy person in those singles like Anaconda. The above with an excellent choice of producers everytime give us the one of the best female rappers today. ",
