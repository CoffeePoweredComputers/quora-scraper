This year is the 13th year since he published his first album which named as his name \"Jay\". This album has sold well, and from then on, he became more and more popular. His songs are extrordinary, and the most impressive songs are always made up with Traditional Chinese Cultures. e.g. \u9752\u82b1\u74f7(Qing hua ci). You can enjoy the most traditional music from China, that's also why I love his songs so much. I don't know anything else to answer you, but I suggest if you are really interested in him, you can search the Google with \"Jay Chou\" or \"\u5468\u6770\u502b\". ",

He was popular for a while then disappeared from the stage since he got depressive disorder. my favorite song, of him, is \u751f\u5982\u590f\u82b1.  And if you mean the latter, Eason Chan, of course. Besides, Xiao Jingteng is probably as a good choice. ",
