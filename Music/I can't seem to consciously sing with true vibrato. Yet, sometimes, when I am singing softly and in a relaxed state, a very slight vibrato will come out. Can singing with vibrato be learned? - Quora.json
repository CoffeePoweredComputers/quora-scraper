            "answer_text": "Work on developing vocal quality. Get the basics down. Learn to sing with proper breath support, a relaxed, open throat, and work on resonance. I\u2019ve heard people attempt vibrato before gaining this control. You need both control and a relaxed throat before you work on vibrato. If you are tense, you can\u2019t do it. You also need steady, even breaths to support the sound. Vibrato should be a quick variation in pitch that comes naturally. Listen for the variation when you are singing. As your voice matures, it will develop vibrato. However, not everyone has a strong vibrato. It may never be very strong but you can develop it. Practice often and work on the basics and your voice can become amazing. ",

            "answer_text": "In short\u2026 yes. If you get some vibrato when you\u2019re relaxed, you\u2019re on the right track! Sing like this often and you\u2019ll train your muscles to do it. It\u2019s very much like exercise. Eventually, it will come naturally to you. Beware that this is a slow process and may take years. I\u2019m not sure of your age, so if you are younger than 22 (ish) then you are still in the development period and your voice is changing constantly. Try not to push vibrato, since there are far more important vocal techniques you can learn, such as jumps, trills, runs, etc. Best of luck on your musical journey! ",
