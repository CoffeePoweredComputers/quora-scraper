            "answer_text": "I presume you do other things, such as work, eat, and such, so I\u2019ll focus on the choice of doing things that do not happen to involve listening to music. You can make music! Sing. In the out-of-doors singing sounds best, or in the shower, or anywhere. Just make up a song, or sing something you know - anything. To be producing music is a great privilege of being a human being. Reading can only be done in silence. Thinking, just considering ideas, often requires silence - when I am struck by an idea on the radio, I turn it off so I can talk with myself about it. The music of the outdoors is plenty when gardening or walking, though, of course you can sing while doing these, too. I have sometimes put some music on a machine, but after awhile it feels like the machine is ruling me, so I turn it off. Years ago (1968) I was driving my Rambler on the California freeway in farm country. There was nothing on the radio but static and annoying music. So I clicked the thing off, and within seconds I heard a red-winged blackbird in a field (I always drive with the windows down today, something this experience taught me), and puttered along at the 50 mph the Rambler would do, listening for more of the sounds in th real world.
