            "answer_text": "There is no one way, but here is the way I often do it\u2026 Be organized - arranged and re-order tracks, group them, colour code them so you know what is where BEFORE you start to mix. It\u2019s counter productive to your creativity to have to deal with this stuff later. Also at this point set up all your routing, so buses for your tracks, reverbs, delays, and logical subgroups. You can set up master fader processing if you want - but it is by no means a must-do. In a DAW session, probably pull all the tracks WAY down as they will have no doubt have been recorded way too loud, and you want some headroom on your stereo bus. Throw a VU meter on your stereo bus - yep, the old style one with the needle. When your mix is pretty much together, you want your needle to be hitting about zero. This is old school, but digital peak meters are useless and this is how it would work on a mixing desk. Listen to the tracks together as soon as possible to get an idea of what makes up the song, and make a super rough mix as fast as you can free to based on what you hear. As you do this, add markers to denote the individual sections so you can get to them quickly. Now you know what\u2019s where, and you know what the individual parts are, you can mute out some sections and work on a few things at a time, for me usually starting with drums and bass. Here\u2019s where I fundamentally disagree with a previous poster: another guy said roll off unnecessary HF & LF - don\u2019t. Don\u2019t EVER do anything by default. The more you EQ, the more you mess with phase and harmonic content. First few passes - only EQ things which are problems. Is something bugging you on playback? If so, fix it. Do not use a frequency analyser OR your eyes - use your ears, train them. Reference other tracks if you find it helpful to gauge things like \u201cis there enough bass\u201d or broad stroke situations. As more instruments come in, think about your panning, dynamic control and effects, and sure, feel free to use EQ more creatively and to shape but remember that sounds only really make sense in the context of the mix - so keep balancing, and refine, refine, refine. Get the vocals in EARLY as everything else in your mix will fit around those - don\u2019t add them last and expect it to work! It can be a good idea to mix the loudest section of the song first and work outwards. At this point you will probably need to start adding automation as things rarely sit where they should for a whole song, so start doing that. Again, refine refine refine. Think about your polish now\u2026spot effects, moves to add drama, etc. Do it. Do it. Listen to your mix loud, quiet, on a little boom box and from the other room with the door open. refine. Print it, and have a break. Listen the next day, make some tweaks. Done. ",

            "answer_text": "Well. Ask 20 engineers, you\u2019ll get about 700 answers. Mixing styles tend to be personal and dependent to an extent on the song and the genre. I think most engineers can agree, though, that you generally want a good balance of frequencies - you don\u2019t want everything in your track to sit in the same range so your snare drum, vocals and guitar are all fighting for attention - and you want some dynamic range (if you must squeeze out every available drop of loudness, do that after the track sounds good). So, how do you improve mixing? First: listen to a lot of music. Not just stuff you like. Listen to everything. Don\u2019t like country music? Listen to some country music anyway. Don\u2019t like classical? Listen to a recording of some Bach cantatas. Learn to listen to not just the song, but the sense of space, and how things fit together and sit in a mix. It\u2019s a skill that takes practice, and frankly once you get good at it it\u2019s hard to stop and sit back and just listen to a song without analyzing it, but there are worse problems to have. Second: Learn your tools. Whether you\u2019re mixing with Pro Tools and a rack of outboard gear or with the version of Live that came free with your audio interface, spend time just learning how to use the EQs, Compressors, Delays, reverbs and most importantly the mixer. All the fancy effects like crazy bit crushers and multiband saturators come later. Learn how your EQ responds to your input, and learn what it does to various tracks. While it\u2019s fun (albeit not cheap) to acquire the latest and greatest gear and software, 95% of what you do in mixing will be very basic - levels, EQ, space, and dynamic control. Adding that extra push of good analog gear or the latest Empirical Distressor clone plugin may help you get that last 5%, but that\u2019s only useful if you\u2019re up the first 95. Third: learn to turn things down. Your vocals not loud enough in the mix? Snare drum not punchy enough? Instead of turning those things up, turn other things down. You have a lot more room to turn things down than to turn things up, and when you start running out of \u201cup\u201d you start having to make weird decisions to get stuff to fit. Fourth: listening environment. This can be tricky, especially on a budget. But to be perfectly honest it\u2019s hard to fix what you can\u2019t hear accurately. Not everyone can afford high end studio monitors or lay down a ton of acoustic treatment, but if you can afford to do any of that, do what you can. Even good headphones make a difference (but be aware that headphones and speakers do not respond the same way, so you\u2019ll need to compensate for the differences. That\u2019s a whoooole other topic). Fifth: don\u2019t overdo it. The tendency is, and I am suuuuper guilty of this, to get an individual stem sounding awesome in isolation, layered with compressors and EQs and fancy effects and stuff. The problem is if you do that enough, once you put it all together, you get mud. Before you start piling on the effects, listen to a few stems at a time - how do the drums and the bass fit together and interact? Howabout the vocals and the synths? The synths and the bass? What\u2019s likely to clash? Got guitars? How are they doing against the vocals? What\u2019s great, though is often just a little bit of a change can fix a lot. Vocals not sitting right against the guitars? Try gently pulling down the guitar EQ a db or two at around 3000hz, suddenly things might fit together better. Tiny changes can have huge effects. Anyone here can spend probably years detailing individual tips and tricks for what sort of compression ratios to use for what instruments, and where things sit in EQ bands, and how to use a delay to make your instruments sound wider, etc etc. But the real trick is knowing what to listen for, and knowing what to do with it. You can follow every tip-from-the-masters in the book and still end up with a crappy mix because your vocal recording isn\u2019t exactly like everyone else\u2019s or the guitarist decided to turn his amp up a little higher that day or the guy with the drum machine decided to jack the bass. And sometimes, happy accidents happen when you do the \u201cwrong thing\u201d anyway. Think it sounds cool when you crank the snare so it\u2019s redlining? Crank that snare then. If it sounds good, it is good.* * (with some exceptions) ",
