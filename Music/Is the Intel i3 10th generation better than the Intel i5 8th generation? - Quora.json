            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say definitively, as the i3 10th generation isn\u2019t out yet, and the current leaks of 10th generation Intel core processors only cover i5 and i7 mobile CPUs. It\u2019s also possible that the 10th generation will be better than the 8th generation on laptops but not on desktops, or vice versa. However, based on what we know, it is likely that 10th generation i3s will still have 2 cores on laptops and 4 cores with no hyperthreading on desktop, in which case overall performance is still likely to be lower than the 8th generation i5s (4 cores with hyperthreading on laptops and 6 cores with no hyperthreading on desktop). However, single-thread performance may be slightly in favour of the 10th generation i3s, and graphics performance on the 10th generation is expected to be significantly better than the 8th generation due to \u201cgen 11\u201d graphics. Confusingly the 10th generation CPUs have 11th generation graphics, because Intel decided for some reason that skipping the 10th generation of graphics was a good branding decision. This decision was possibly to make it clear that the CPU generations are not linked to graphics generations, as the current 9th generation of both the CPU and graphics is actually a coincidence - the generations do not normally align, but Intel have been stuck on 9th generation graphics for far longer than they were expecting due to problems with their 10nm architecture.

            "answer_text": "i3 10th generation 10110U vs i5 8th gen 8265U  The short answer is - No When you are buying a laptop there are 3 features that you can see initially in the processor department are the clock speeds the model of the processor and its generation. But that doesn't give us a clear picture of of the performance the i3 10th generation laptop may look like a good option however the performance difference between an I5 8th generation and i3 10th generation laptop is quite significant if you look at the numbers i5 8th generation is almost 50% faster than and it's i3 10th generation counterpart Look at the base and Max frequencies of the i3 10th generation is slightly better than i5 8th generation but when we look at the cores and the number of threads the i5 comes on top. While the i5 also have 50 percent higher cache. So what does it mean? i5 will perform better in multitasking and will have low lately but i3 will perform slightly better in certain applications that require just one core which are becoming lesser by the day.
