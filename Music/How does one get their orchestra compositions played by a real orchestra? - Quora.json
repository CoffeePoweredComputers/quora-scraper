            "answer_text": "This is a common challenge for young composers. As a conductor and a president of a \u201creal\u201d (amateur, community) orchestra, I can give a few suggestions regarding this from my perspective. Not many orchestras like to perform new music, but most conductors actually enjoy the challenge and the process. While I find it incredibly gratifying to work on Beethoven\u2019s 7th, or Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Scheherazade, these old scores have been done millions of times, and there are plenty of remarkable recordings by the best orchestras of the world. There isn\u2019t much new that a conductor can find there, and the primary satisfaction comes from working through a masterpiece that had stood the test of time (and that really is profoundly satisfying). Working with a living composer poses different challenges, as well as thrills. In my experience, the work tends to receive last-minute revisions almost until the day of the performance, with the composer often striving to improve it after hearing it played by the living, breathing ensemble. It also allows the conductor to suggest changes when the material poses logistical or technical challenges (balance of sound, difficult leaps, trills, or arpeggios to execute, due to instrument limitations, etc). In many developed countries, there are many amateur community orchestras, especially in countries where plentiful conservatories or music colleges churn out highly trained musicians that can\u2019t find professional work other than teaching. Many of these ensembles have quite high (and fairly consistent) level of musicianship and have active performance schedule with anywhere between 5 - 15 concerts per season. Establishing contact with music directors of these ensembles is a good first step. While e-mail costs nothing, the result is usually proportionate to the effort (I receive frequent e-mails from composers around the world offering pieces to play). Attending a concert performance and introducing oneself to the music director demonstrates greater effort, and a direct face-to-face contact makes it much more likely that we may take the time to listen to your recordings and think about them. For me, the most important part in considering a new work is that the composer is actually properly trained and musically literate. I need to be sure that the orchestrator knows intimately what each instrument can and cannot play, how to write for each instrument, what kind of articulation, expression and phrasing is appropriate for which instrument group, what kind of dynamic relationships between instruments and sections work, and which don\u2019t, etc. Ideally, the composer would also work with a copyist who knows how to properly prepare the score for the conductor, and the parts for the orchestra. They must be done in correct staff size, multi-rests should have bar number ranges below them, the score (and parts) would need plentiful rehearsal marks, cues would need to be provided after every multi-rest longer than about 10 measures, page turns must be accommodated (by making sure there\u2019s enough rest at end of right-hand page), etc\u2026. In reality, though, unfortunately I never get parts prepared like this, so I usually as for Sibelius files and do it all myself. If your music is original, creative and good, and it is properly written and scored, so that I don\u2019t have to do your work, you may have a chance of getting it performed. ",

            "answer_text": "When i was in college i wrote a symphony. The offers to play it did not pour in so i recruited my musician friends to form an orchestra. I conducted them and rehearsed them and put on a concert of my symphony. I did it all again for a second symphony. I will never do that again. Way too much work, uphill and against the wind from beginning to end. But it was real orchestra. They were real musicians, really playing. But I guess you want someone famous to play your music so you can be famous too. Then you have to ask yourself\u2026 why should they? Famous orchestras have musicians to pay. Will your music make more money for them than whatever else they could be playing? (In the US, audiences avoid concerts with new music on them as if they were a contagious disease.) To get any orchestra to play your music on their own money you will need some person of influence on the inside who will champion your cause. The conductor, a wealthy benefactor, the conductor\u2019s mistress\u2026 someone with deciding power. Absent any of the above\u2026 you do what Frank Zappa did. He paid them. No one was interested in playing his orchestral music (for good reason) so he paid the London Symphony Orchestra to do it. ",
