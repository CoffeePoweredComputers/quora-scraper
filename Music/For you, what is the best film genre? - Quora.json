            "answer_text": "The Western is my favorite genre. Westerns are the quintessential American movie genre - depicting life on the frontier, even as Hollywood was just struggling to get a toehold on that frontier. Westerns paint larger than life characters across larger than life natural landscapes, much in the way of the paintings of Frederic Remington. There is no genre with greater storytelling capabilities than the Western. The beautiful desolation of the west is a harsh place - blazing heat, freezing cold, a lack of water, and dangerous creatures. Life on the frontier is life on the edge of civilization. The western genre easily traverses the valley between society and the wild. There\u2019s nothing better than a hero putting on a pair of boots and a Stetson and riding out into the desert to right a wrong. The environment, period, and types of characters featured in Westerns makes it the genre that best subscribes to the seven types of narrative conflict. Character vs. Character Whether it be the classic white hat versus black hat or the more complex grey hat versus grey hat, the west was conquered by strong people with strong personas - providing rich personal conflict. Westerns from Red River (1948) to 3:10 to Yuma (1957) take two characters with wildly divergent viewpoints and missions and send them on a journey together in which those disagreements are pushed to the limits. Character vs. Nature The Southwest of the United States is stunningly beautiful, but it is also harsh, especially in the period of the Western - blazing heat, freezing cold, a lack of water, and hostile flora and fauna. Nature could kill a person in a day. Every time a character stepped outside of town, a battle with nature began. As far back as The Wind (1928), starring Lillian Gish as a young woman from Virginia who marries and relocates to West Texas, where the maddening wind never ceases, westerns have used the environment for conflict. Character vs. Society When the hero rides into town and finds himself the only one willing to stand up for what is right, he takes on society. In High Noon (1952), Gary Cooper plays Will Kane, a marshal on his last day in office. He has just married and is ready to give up the responsibility. But he has also just found out that a dangerous criminal that he sent to prison has been released, and is coming to town, with his gang, to kill the sheriff and anyone else in town that he has a grudge against. Kane feels duty bound to defend the town, even though no-one in town will assist him. It's a gripping story told almost in real time. The film is rich in allegory and a true classic. High Noon was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Actor for Cooper. Shane (1953) examines the evolution of society on the frontier from lawlessness to civilization and the inability for a man associated with that earlier stage to join the latter stage. Character vs. Self People coming to the west left their old lives behind and started anew - defined themselves anew and struggled with the definition of the self. The Searchers (1956), a John Ford and John Wayne collaboration, is considered one of the best films of all-time. It is number seven on the BFI\u2019s Sight & Sound Top 50 films. It is a masterpiece of the conflict with the self. The main character goes through a transformation and has an epiphany as he finally understands who he is, at his core. Character vs. Technology The period western has the old ways of life being quickly overtaken by approaching technology. There\u2019s little more dramatic that the transitions from horse to train, from six-shooter to Gatling gun, and from ranching to oil. Character vs. Fate The idea of fatalism plays a common role in westerns. Do we define our own destiny or is it predetermined? It is an idea easily toyed with when telling stories in the past. The audience knows that no matter what the characters on screen do, their way of life is coming to an end. Character vs. Supernatural The western provides us two competing faiths that can be mined for supernatural conflict. We have the puritanical and evangelical settlers, taking their faith to the frontier and trying to displace the resident native tribes with their own spiritual practices that are exotic to the audience, including practices such as vision quests.

            "answer_text": "What is my favorite movie genre? Before then, I\u2019d say Dramas no doubt. Especially those movies that are slow motion, realistic and that sometimes portrays sad lives, shows the life in all goodness and badness. Now I am not embarrassed in the slightest to answer with Romantic Comedies. Julie and Julia  Romantic comedies are like the friend you need when you are bored or upset. It feels like eating the whole bar of your favorite chocolate and drinking hot chocolate (not at the same time). If your friends are busy and not free to listen to your problems, grab a coffee or tea, and open a rom-com with your favorite actors to uplift your mood. My favorite actors are Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Meg Ryan, Cameron Diaz and some male actors I don't know by name that star in many rom-coms. The Holiday  They are easy to watch. You don't have to speculate on why we are on this earth, what you\u2019re doing with your life while watching. Just get to know the leading characters and get ready for watching them not liking one another at first and then falling head over heels in love. Cliche but fun and romantic.  They also remind me that life is simple and not too complicated at the end. People meet, fall in love or not fall in love. Small hiccups happen, life gets in the way, people keep missing one another while working at the same workplace and then become aware of the presence of the other and fall in love. They have their heart broken but some months later they fall in love again. They get cheated on but then forget about the past quickly and fall in love again. These are the things we say \u201cNo this happened too quickly\u201d in movies but they give me hope after all. Also these sort of things are included in real life too. In reality it doesn't take 2 months but maybe 6 months or a year to date someone else after you had your heart broken by your ex but it happens. So, romantic comedies remind me the beautifully existing shallowness of life, easiness of life that there is a rule that everything that ought to happen happens. What a relief! And not all rom-coms are unrealistic or not in all of them things happen way faster than in real life. There are some really realistic and quality rom-coms. How I describe a rom-com is by the smile it puts on my face watching it, because many of them really do that. I forget about things I care about for an hour or two.

            "answer_text": "My favourite movie genre can be considered \u201cniche\u201d, as the signature characteristics of films of its ilk are more nuanced and precise when sorting them. However, its level of impact on the world of film has more outreaching effects than some would initially consider. I am referring to the weird yet compelling genre of \"Psychological Thrillers\". Definition Psychological thrillers are (obviously) a subset of the thriller genre, but have key differences in both creation and story execution to the films \"just\" designed to thrill an audience and fill seats. The nature of the story has to have a psychological bearing, relating to the brain and its abilities in some way. Often a psychological thriller will play with mental concepts such as memory, perception, amnesia, fear, fantasy vs. reality, illness and even time distortion, to name a few. The nature of psychological thrillers bearing one or more of these as a central theme can resonate strongly with an audience, as we all use our brains to live moreso than just existing (at least, that's how we perceive it). If we are seeing on screen the effects of something that could potentially be happening in our brains, then our minds are drawn in to the cinematic spectacle. Depending on the film, we may even feel like less of a passive viewer and more an active participant in an experiment. Expanding on the creation of psychological thrillers, accurately conveying the effects of an inherently internal affliction or condition relies on the detailing used to portray said condition. This can be done through the use of camera tricks and special effects, but also use editing tricks and symbolism. A balance of techniques used during both filming and editing can help tell a story purely through a visual medium, without the need to rely on dialogue to explain what we are seeing. Cinematic Examples An example of this is Jacob's Ladder (1995), a film that utilises both what is shown on screen and how it is shown to get inside the mind of the viewer. This example crosses over with psychological horror, but still retains the aforementioned qualities that make it more psychological than horror. (N.B: As I highly recommend this film to those interested in this genre and/or filmmaking techniques, mild spoilers follow.) After the initial war-torn setting sets the scene for several seconds and we are introduced to our protagonist, we are suddenly taken to a different location, a subway station. Already the juxtaposition between unfamiliar and familiar is jarring enough, which the sound design reflects through the cut from vulgar language and shouting to the ambient echoes of a local underground transport system. However, this subway station is not as pleasant as initially portrayed. After the protagonist spends a moment wandering the station, we see he is the only person there. Unusual for a place usually seen busy and bustling with people on a constant basis. Making his way towards the exit, he then finds himself on the train tracks. Suddenly a train comes barreling towards him. He dodges left, right and left again, but he is still on the tracks, as if the train is aiming for him and not stuck on the tracks. He falls down and rolls off the tracks just in time to see human figures standing at the window, hands pressed against the glass. When the last carriage passes by, he sees a not-quite-human standing still, staring at him as the train gets further away. The 'thing' then raises its hand and waves slowly, in an almost sinister way. The visuals are doing their job of being unnerving, dipping into the Uncanny Valley of something being almost familiar, but not wholly. However, the effects are amplified by the editing. As a great horror writer will often say: \"The more you look at a monster, the less afraid you become of it.\" This film utilises that technique by giving us little hints and glimpses, but never a full picture. The passengers on the train go by the camera so fast we can't really see what they are. The only discernable detail is that they have human features, but there's something off about them. Their skin looks to be too pale, they don't appear to be moving, their faces don't seem normal\u2026 but it passes by too blurred and too quick for us to be sure. We are left wondering \"What the hell did I just see?\" Consider how this scene would be affected if we had long and clear close-ups of whatever was on the train as it went past, so there was no ambiguity. While it would no doubt be more effective in scaring an audience in that moment, it would be akin to pulling back the curtain from a magic show. We now recognise what we are supposed to fear. Because the film plays with the audience's perception of what is going on, as opposed to merely conjuring up a frightful sight, our minds are being played with as the film continues digging away at the psyche of the protagonist. And maybe even your own. It should be noted that while a psychological thriller has themes about the mind and the brain at its core, just mentioning them in context does not entitle the DVD case to emblazon itself \"A psychological thriller\". To highlight the difference, compare the two films Inception (2010) and Psycho (1960). If you have not seen either, then I highly recommend watching both. Not right now, though, so I'll give you a spoiler-free rundown. The former consists of people who are employed to make journeys inside people's dreams and steal secrets, with a lot of visual symbolism to depict the vapid and collapsible nature of memory and how the brain draws inspiration from them. The latter is a crime drama, where a successful robbery is turned on its head after the robber is murdered in a motel shower. The identity of the killer is the driving question for the rest of the film's story. Now, based on those honest synopses, which do you think is the psychological thriller? You'd be forgiven for thinking Inception. The reason why they differ greatly despite the subject matter and content is how the story is unveiled to the audience. While Inception uses Christopher Nolan's signature directional style of playing with the order of the story, the plane on which the story exists is simply a backdrop for a complex sequence with action scenes and impressive CGI throughout. This is why Inception is often lumped in with the ever-growing ambiguous \"Action-Adventure\" genre. While it is no doubt a thriller, it lacks the psychological merit. Everything you see on the screen stays on the screen. Psycho, on the other hand, uses its unconventionally \"normal\" setting to lull the audience into a false sense of security. (N.B: Yes, spoiler warning, even though it's nearly 60 years old). The first half of the film has a daring yet fragile woman making an effort to break out of monotony by stealing money and getting away scot-free. However, her flustered behaviour causes her to become somewhat paranoid, as shown when she overreacts to innocuous questions from innocent people. Then, after an odd (but not alarming) check-in at a motel, she is murdered in the shower by a female assailant hidden from view. With no warning for the audience, the protagonist and her story has ended. For 1960, this was unheard of in the world of cinema! 'Killing off the protagonist halfway through the film? How DARE they!' So what is it about this halfway plot switch that makes it more psychological than Inception? Well, as my mock quote above outlined, such a dramatic choice in the film would have confused and angered the audiences of its time no end. The film had infiltrated their minds and twisted up storytelling convention until it was unrecognisable. The second half of the film is no way as clear cut as the first half. We have the sinister yet sincere motel runner Norman Bates, an abusive and controlling old woman, the mother of Norman, whose presence is only made known to the audience via her voice. The story picks up Norman's fear in light of what has just happened. Now the protagonist is Norman, having to deal with a murder that no-one can possibly find out about. His inner turmoil in dealing with the crime is played with subtlely as he attempts to cover up the crime. One exemplar scene is when Norman attempts to sink the dead woman's car in a swamp, but just as he attempts to drive it in, he hears an aeroplane engine motor gradually get louder and louder overhead. He is visibly shaken and panicky because of this. After he jumps out and looks up for the plane, it is not there. The sound of the engine is now ebbing away. Whether or not that was real or just a manifestation of Norman's fears is never explained. But then again, it doesn't have to be. Regardless, all we needed to know was the effect it had on Norman's mind. That is the real element of psychological thrillers: how effective they are in communicating how the brain works, as well as what happens when the brain isn't working as it should. Plot Twists One of the reasons this genre is my favourite comes down to my personal make or break factor of a good psychological thriller: the plot twist. It should be noted that a plot twist is not a requirement for psychological thrillers, but there is a significant correlation between the two. For better or worse, the plot twist has now firmly established itself in the 'modern film script checklist', along with \"Token Ethnic/Minority Character\", \"Romantic Subplot\" and \"Not-So-Subtle Political Message\". (All of these facets are make/break points in films, but that is for another time. For now, let's stick to plot twists.) Irrespective of genre, a plot twist now has to be inserted into a film so as to have a talking point. However, one thing that a lot of filmmakers rely on is the plot twist carrying the story. A good psychological thriller, on the other hand, will be able to carry a surprising plot twist. I judge the weight and merit of a plot twist on a few things: shock factor, coherency and replay value. Shock factor is the most immediate one. Does the plot twist surprise, shock, or otherwise provoke an emotion within me that changes my perception of the film? This matters, because not every plot twist has to be shocking to be good. Some plot twists have more insidious roots in a story, so when they are revealed they do not make me shout \"NO WAY!\" Instead, I sit there in silence nodding approvingly as the story development washes over me like a cool breeze. Both of these reactions make me think differently about what I was led to believe from what the film had previously shown me, making any examples of the two a good plot twist. To counter that, a less than stellar plot twist will be one with no shock factor. When the plot twist is revealed and there is no discernible reaction, it means it is not satisying. My perception of the story may have been subverted, but the twist had no build-up, for felt shoehorned in, or simply wasn't interesting enough to elicit a reaction. The film ends, not with a \"WOW!\", but with an \"Oh\u2026\" Secondly, coherency. After finishing the film and thinking about how good/bad/average it was, reviewing how much the plot twist actually made sense determines how good it was in hindsight. The sudden reveal that a character was secretly evil despite lots of viable evidence to suggest otherwise seems like a deliberate attempt to shoehorn in a shocking swerve to a good story. These are known as \"cheats in the narrative\", which I think is befitting of such lacklustre twists, as the feeling of being cheated by a film can make me feel insulted. This has another, more permanent effect of me being less likely to watch the film again. This isn't a demand for infallible stories. As CinemaSins put it: 'No movie is without sin.' However, a meagre plot twist that breaks the pacing and coherency of the story over its knee with a sickening crunch has an equal effect on the moviegoer watching it. Thirdly, the replay value of a psychological thriller. There has been a notable increase in recent years with attempts to try and join this niche venue, with varying degrees of success. As an aside, I feel the oversaturation of plot twists in other film genres has tainted modern psychological thriller wannabes, with the idea that \"plot twist = psychological\". So when debating whether it is worth re-watching the film, I ask the same question: \"Does it feel like the film was written around the plot twist, or vice versa?\" This echoes my earlier notion that a plot twist is rarely capable of holding up a whole film, because if the plot twist was taken away, you have a flat story with very little in the way of merit. Once you know how the magician does the trick, you can still enjoy the trick if there is enough showmanship and intrigue to entice the audience into seeing it again. In contrast, if the film lacks artistic flair or an element of personal investment, how else is the magician supposed to keep you coming back for more? You may realise I'm listing a lot of negative examples when I'm supposed to be explaining why this is my favourite movie genre, but there's a good reason for this. Essentially, psychological thrillers that include the problems listed above are few and far between. Many of them can be considered stellar examples in their own right, not just from watching them, but the trendsetting power they have on cinema. Psycho paved the way for how we watch films today. Jacob's Ladder was an inspiration for Konami's Silent Hill, a video game series that also favours foreboding psychological imagery over jumpscares and gore. Christopher Nolan's debut feature film Memento (2000) was the start of a signature style of cinematography, which has been used by many directors and editors since. Mulholland Dr. (2001) plays genre staples of psychology up to 11, without a clear ending and very little in the way of explanation, requiring the audience to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of a plot. Oldboy (2003) is an Eastern example (Korean, specifically) that similarly takes Eastern storytelling staples and subtlely subverts them, resulting in a haunting and memorable story that the American remake failed to recapture. Shutter Island (2010), Donnie Darko (2001), The Silence of the Lambs (1991), they are ALL psychological thrillers. To me, this genre is the ultimate expression of how films are more than just marketing cash cows or pleasant distractions for weekend afternoons. They show how films can alter your mind, present investing stories without underestimating the audience, and highlight the little mental details that show our brains aren't infallible (and how that isn't a bad thing). When done right, as most of them are, they combine evocative cinematic imagery, well-crafted stories which defy convention, and the sense that everything you see was done for the art rather than for the box office receipts. These, I feel, are the marks of a good genre. And that genre (for the 17th time) is psychological thrillers. TL;DR: My favourite film genre is psychological thrillers, because they allow for the greatest reach of artistic cinematography and stories that actively play with the characters' minds as well as the audiences'. Author's Note: All of the films I mentioned in this answer are highly recommended for anyone interested in psychology, psychological thrillers and/or different styles of cinematography and editing. I will add a slight warning and say most of them are rated 15 or 18, so viewer discretion is advised when watching. I'll also add a link to the TV Tropes page for psychological thrillers, which has an extensive list of films if you want more: Psychological Thriller - TV Tropes Enjoy! -RM ",

            "answer_text": "And they lived happily ever after..!? A lot of films end on this note. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, their love hits a rough patch, some melodrama and in the end they unite and live happily ever after. But is that the case in real life? I doubt. I think \u201chappily ever after\u201d is a huge misconception that our films stuff into our heads. In reality marriage isn't a bed of roses and it takes a whole lot of work put in by both parties to make it work. Once the initial euphoria has set in and you start getting used to each other is when the real test of your love begins. And for the same reason, I love movies that potray this phase of a relationship. Because lets face it, we all know the tussles that a relationship can bring to the table after the so called honeymoon phase is over. Movies that have explored what happens after marriage are Sairat, James and Alice, Munthirivallikal Thalirkumbol etc. In Sairat Archi after running away with Parshya does start missing home, the privileges she lived in, differences start to crop up in their relationship, they engage in fights, but through all this, their relationship triumphs and stands the test of time. Now that to me true love. In James and Alice( Malayalam) James and Alice have had a love marriage. Alice left her home, her family for James. But in a few years they start taking each other for granted. There is a lack of communication and resultant misunderstandings that crop up. The rift between them keeps widening, and in James' haste to make ends meet he has no time for Alice, resulting in a lot of disappointments. However an accident that almost takes James' life makes them realize their love for each other. In Munthirivallikal Thalirkkumbol, Ulhannan and Anyamma have been married for many years and they are bored of each other amidst their monotonous life. Ulhannan meets his ex during a college reunion and reminisces how full of life he used to be and how things have changed over the years. He almost gets into an affair with another woman in the process of reinventing his lost spark. But the women happens to be a philanderer. So he goes back to his wife and rekindles their love for each other. These movies, especially the last two potray life after marriage in it's truest sense and that makes me a fan of them. Let's hope more movies are made on these rather unexplored lines. ",

            "answer_text": "Man, that is a very good question, but a little tough for me to answer! Why? Because, I like several/different film genres: i.e. mystery & suspense, crime drama, Western, action & adventure, comedy, historical, and some fantasy. But, the genre that I love the most would be science fiction. Whether, it is film franchises like \u201cStar Wars\u201d, \u201cStar Trek\u201d, \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d, \u201cBack to the Future\u201d, \u201cThe Matrix\u201d, \u201cThe Predator\u201d, \u201cMad Max\u201d, \u201cRoboCop\u201d, \u201cThe Terminator\u201d, and/or \u201cAlien\u201d. Another, one of my favorite film genres or subgenres I should say, that can best be described as a blending of science fiction and fantasy, would be the superhero-action movie. Some of my favorite superhero film franchises include the \u201cX-Men\u201d, \u201cWolverine\u201d, \u201cDeadpool\u201d, \u201cSuperman\u201d (Richard Donner), \u201cSpider-Man\u201d (Sam Raimi), \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cBatman\u201d (Tim Burton), \u201cWonder Woman\u201d, \u201cThe Avengers\u201d, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d, \u201cThor\u201d, and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d. Thanks for reading my opinions and commentary. Fin. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to love war movies - the way children gobble up stories with \u201cmoral\u201d, I think. I haven\u2019t seen many since their popularity wanes\u2026 in mid 2000s, I guess. I doubt I feel the same way these days. The kind of movies I like now\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what genre to call them. It\u2019s probably better to name directors I like: Lars von Trier (def. for Dancer in the Dark)Ang Lee (especially Lust, Caution)Wong Kar Wai (for so many but In the Mood for Love def. the topper)Zhang YimouAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rrituLasse Hallstr\u00f6mAlfonso Cuar\u00f3nDanny BoyleAnd although they sometimes make questionable choices, I definitely will go and watch any movie my favorite actors star in. Alfred MolinaJames McAvoyAmy Adams I reckon the films I like usually take their time showing you what is going on, unfolding the story in a way that leaves some things to your own interpretation. You go along thinking, \u201cOh, so that\u2019s why.\u201d \u201cOh, so that earlier scene was because of this. I see.\u201d It sounds like a cliche, that I want a story to show me things instead of tell, but once you\u2019re exposed to films, or rather, directors who can do that, you know your preference. Another thing is the ruthlessness. I like it when there\u2019s a degree of \u201c\u2026this is how life can be. Deal with it, life goes on.\u201d Especially when it is served in a matter of fact way.  I haven\u2019t watched movies in a while though. So many I wanted to, so many newly recommended directors I haven\u2019t checked out. Now that diversity has kicked in somewhat, I am excited to see more female directors and hopefully, longer trajectory in the careers of female actors. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A!! Actually, it all depends on my mood. I'm always up for a Marvel movie, and a couple of DC ones (specifically Wonder Woman, Justice League, Suicide Squad). And, of course, any and all Star Wars & Star Trek. I'm not a big fan of romantic movies, comedy or otherwise. There are some war specific movies, but not the whole genre. I liked Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge but not too many others. I LOVED M*A*S*H, but I categorized that more of a comedy. I understand now it's comedic in showing how people cope with the horrors of war, and I love it. Love most comedies. I really liked all the Harry Potter and Twilight and Jurassic Park movies. I even like (hold onto your hats) the Fifty Shades movies. I am nothing if not an agreeable friend when it comes down to \u201cWhat movie should we go see?\u201d   ",

            "answer_text": "That's like asking what one food would you prefer to eat for the rest of your life? It's impossible for someone who has watched thousands of films, and enjoyed the majority, of them to pick a single genre.  I tried. I really did. I had categories such as: MusicalClassic comedyLight comedyWesternDramaRomanceWar moviealong with examples for each. And then I'd think of another film genre and a bunch more  films that fit in there.  I really don't know what the advantage might be to trying to limit a movie buff's choices to a single best film or best genre or best male or female actor of all time or whatever.  I recognize that some movie fans do have favorites,  One posted the question, \"Is there a movie as good as The Dark Knight?\" which I answered with a long list of films I consider much better. Now, I have no problem with that OP thinking Dark Knight was the best film he or she had ever seen. But I do think it shows an extremely limited experience base from which to determine the \"best\" of anything having to do with films. There is never a \"best film\" or \"best genre.\" Can't be done. There are just too many choices.[1]____________________________________________ [1] Those keeping score at home might bring up the fact that I did make one attempt to pick a \"best film\" in Barry Hampe's answer to What are your favorite movies and why? But even there, I wrote that it was an impossible task, and while I did pick a single film, I listed 39 others, any of which might have come out on top on a different day. ",

            "answer_text": "Action is my favorite genre. In my opinion, it\u2019s one of the most energetic genres because when a character goes through physical challenges like fights, chases, shootouts and explosions, it\u2019s just hard to take eyes off the screen (depends on how intense the action is). The very thought of a choreographed action set piece is exciting. It\u2019s pretty obvious that when you (if you watch it too) watch action, you don\u2019t realize how time passes quickly. A well choreographed fight/chase/explosion/shootout will always impress me whether it\u2019s 10 minutes or 10 seconds long. Also, an action film can be made on any theme. It can be themed on not just good v/s evil but also on themes like violence, disasters, nuclear tests, cyber crimes, career struggles, family issues and what not. An action film surpasses the language barriers better than any genre. Because action film is one which features action scenes in its narrative, there can be any theme for the story and thus a fresher approach to the characters and screenplay, the action feels stronger. I believe that to make a good action movie, you need good action scenes and a good story, or either of the two. Sometimes, the story is so good that even the less impressive action sequences can be forgiven. And if you can\u2019t get a good story, then the action needs to be so impressive that the flaws get ignored. An action film is good enough for an outing to the cinemas. Barring a few, almost all the movies I watched last year in theaters were action movies. Some were dark, some were funny, some were both. The best thing is when I hear that a film is an action entertainer, I never get to know what kind of a story it would be having. Of course, there are some pretty common themes in action movies like one man army, heroic rescue etc but technically and in a deeper sense, action movies don\u2019t have one fixed theme or storytelling pattern. Action movies can be complex and non-escapist too as all the genre needs is action with a narrative of any kind. An action movie needs not to necessarily feature an action hero. It can be also about a character who\u2019s not an action hero but becomes one as time passes. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to feature too many action scenes. Just two big action sequences at minimum would be enough for an action movie which also wants to go the story way. If I come across an action movie, I\u2019ll make sure to give it a watch if I find it interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I like to watch movies of many genres. When u watch so many great movies of different genres u can't really decide which one genre u like the most. But I don't like horror, I think that why put urself in a difficult position afterall movies are for having fun and I don't feel like it being scared most of the time while watching it. And that is not same with Thriller and Mystery movies, I think u know the difference. Some of the genres I like are Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy (sometimes), Romance, Western (Mostly Tarantino movies), Drama, Fantasy (Like Star Wars or LOTR), Animated and Crime. So if u want to know which type of movies to watch, well u gotta know ur taste and watch accordingly. If u don't actually know ur taste and it is very common, IMDb is the best platform to explore movies, just start watching their top 250 list. They're one of thre most legendary movies of all time. Hope it helps!! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most common questions in my comment section is this: What is your favorite genre of movies? To that I very rarely have an answer. I just love movies, all different kinds of movies. I gave Beauty and the Beast (1991) a 10/10 and I gave The Seventh Seal a 10/10. So the answer that I normally go with is that I love good movies; Genre be damned. If it\u2019s good, I\u2019ll enjoy it. But that\u2019s a boring non-answer. So if you put a gun to my head and said pick your favorite genre of film I think I\u2019d have to go with Intelligent Sci-Fi.  Many of my favorites belong to this genre: Her, Arrival, Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Under the Skin are just a few examples of exceptional Sci-Fi films. These are movies that attempt to explore what it means to be human through characters and situations that are entirely alien. It is this that I find fascinating. Films like these don\u2019t have to stay within the confines of existence in order to explore what they want to explore. Intelligent Science Fiction is limitless. ",

            "answer_text": "The genres which I find tend to exclude themselves the most from all the annoying clich\u00e9s are the comedies and the so called mindfucks (excuse my French). I don't particularly like sci-fi or superhero movies. I usually find them a bit too predictable, which is - I'm sure a lot of people agree - also the main problem with rom-coms, they are also often horribly scientifically impossible and generally implausible. I know that these are basically key features of the genres so as long as these elements are not too obvious I'm fine with it. My brother always gets really annoyed at there being gravity in an essentially flat spacecraft. This would be borderline for me: If the film is good I'll ignore it. An excessive use of movie stereotypes often in action movies, will also turn me off. e.g. the onehandedledgehang or the letsnotkillthegoodguyyet, etc... The comedies can do it by mocking these specific stereotypes, but they are usually fairly predictable and can end up trying to be too funny. The mindfucks are usually quite good, but they are quite hard to classify. If they confuse me then I'm happy. If the mindfuck/twist is too predictable then I'm not a happy bunny. So on the whole I think my favourite film genre is probably the mindfuck genre purely because it produces (for me) on average the least bad films. I would never limit myself to just one genre: you do find good films dotted around in every genre and also you need normal films to make the mindfuck films actually be mindfucky and for the comedies to mock.

A few years ago I realized that most of the stories I\u2019ve consumed in my life, through theater, film, television, books, music, etc., were written from a straight white male perspective. I realized how incredibly limiting that is to me as both an actor and human being and committed to being more conscious about the perspectives in the media I choose to watch. Since then I\u2019ve sought out work from a broader range of perspectives, which turns out to be more enjoyable as a member of the audience, more fulfilling as a person, and healthier for my mind and spirit.

Notable examples: Double Indemnity The Maltese Falcon The Big Sleep Sunset Boulevard The Third Man The Lady From Shanghai Night of the Hunter Detour Key Largo Gilda The Glass Key The Woman in the Window Mr. Arkadin (Confidential Report) I like the stark, expressionist B/W photography, the larger than life characters with their impossibly, irrealistically intense dialogue, the deep intrigue where a usually broken hero (whose fault is often being so \u201cgood\u201d that he\u2019s bad) is surrounded by double-faced evil and treachery, the femme fatales \u2014 a sexist characterization, but one that does not deprive them of power, self determination and (often malevolent) pursuit of their own agenda. Plus the glamour of fedoras, long coats, smoky joints, and the telephone as the most advanced piece of technology available for investigation. (wax cylinders for voice notes on Double Indemnity\u2026.) Modern noirs I also like, such as Chinatown, Mulholland Falls, LA Confidential, Black Dahlia or Poodle Springs, but the irrealism of the subject is more suited I think by a vintage B/W picture than it is conveyed by current photography or familiar, contemporary faces such as Russel Crowe or Scarlett Johannson, as good as they might be. It\u2019s not a case that modern noirs are still often set in the past (or the future \u2014 you could count Blade Runner among neo-noir movies, definitely), so that you are eased in your suspension of disbelief.

My first is as cavalier as everyone else. My favourite is Experimental - less a genre, more a stance against mainstream movies that encompasses many potential genres and styles. My second is faithful to the concept of genre as it was defined from the classical Hollywood period. My favourite is Film Noir, including its antecedent, neo-noir. I adore the grim urban as a setting for essentially human drama. My third is Comedy. I tend to believe that I prefer serious drama and documentary than frivolous (or otherwise) comedy. Yet in my personal collection I have 3x the number of comedy than other classifications (besides the extremely broad church that is documentary). So, despite what I believe, my collection seeks to thrust a custard pie in my grim face. It's for the best. ",

Up until I saw it, I was a fan of crime thrillers like Seven(1995) and The Silence Of The Lambs (1992). But since then I've been in love with this genre. I have watched nearly all of Coen brothers\u2019 films most of which are centred around this genre. Then there is Martin Mcdonagh\u2019s follow up to In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths (2012) which is also a notable work of this genre. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained may also be classified as Dark Comedies. Dark comedy films are basically structured around an eclectic mixture of comedy, drama and violence. Those topics which might seem to be a taboo are often used to evoke laugh. ",

Horror comedy is the only sub genre of horror that I enjoy nowadays, since those rarely let me down. (Think Shaun of the Dead, Cabin in then Woods, What We Do With The Shadows) On a similar note, I love over the top action movies that either deconstruct or rejoice in the genre. (Think Disposables, Hot Fuzz or even Meg.) Movies that don\u2019t take themselves seriously but where the crew clearly enjoyed themselves. All that said, I\u2019m not a genre fan as much as I\u2019m a director fan. It doesn\u2019t matter what genre they choose, if specific directors direct something, I\u2019ll be there to watch them. ",

I like good movies. I like interesting characters and a good cast to portray them. That is my favorite genre. :-) ",

My movie watching logic is pretty simple: watch the trailer and read the synopsis and then decided if it is worth spending 2 hours or not. Usually (read this as 95%) I am right in my decision to watch the movie I select but sometimes I do regret my decision - Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011) Apart from the reasons I gave above, I sometime want to watch the movie listening to my instincts. For eg. Don't Breathe (2016). The trailer for the movie gave up almost everything but I still want to watch it and when I was done watching it, I loved it. Don't Breathe (2016) is a pretty amazing movie. Audience who would love watching horror genre would be disappointed after watching Don't Breathe (2016) as there was no horror in the movie (as labeled by the media or movie recommendation websites). Go watch something that interests you and keep you engaged. If you are not having fun then it doesn\u2019t matter if it is your favorite genre or not. ",

Invariably there is the jerk who refuses to leave even after people die. Their characters are never developed and it is enjoyable to see then slaughtered in various inventive ways. A variant is where a bunch of jerks do something horrific to someone as a joke and they come back and start slaughtering the jerks in various inventive ways. My favorite in this variety is Terror Train with Jamie Lee Curtis. Carrie is also a good example. ",
