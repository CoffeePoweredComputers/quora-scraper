            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an ongoing saying that when Hendrix was asked, how did it feel to be best guitarist in the world? he said he didn\u2019t know and to ask Rory Gallagher.  Many people assume that he pointed at Rory Gallagher to be the best guitarist in the world. But I haven\u2019t seen any proof of it. No video, no conversation anything. But I have seen an interview where he ignores the answer,  (Jimmy Page \ud83d\ude02 and Jimi Hendrix) There\u2019s also a similar statement where Robert Fripp says that Jimi was saying King Crimson was the best group he had ever seen.  (Robert Fripp on meeting Hendrix) So, there\u2019s lots of stories about Hendrix comments. And many may claim that he said he\u2019s the best and she\u2019s the best etc etc. But I think some of his favorites where (contemporaries, not his influences) Eric ClaptonBill GibbonsTerry KathRory Gallagher?Jeff Beck? (Jeff Beck talking about meeting Hendrix) etc etc I think Jimi was being kind and didn\u2019t point anyone so his other fan guitarists might get angry. ",

            "answer_text": "When Jimi went to England in 1966 he thought it would be Eric Clapton. Jimi got up on the stage to jam with Cream, but Clapton walked out. The problem wasn\u2019t that Eric was a crap guitar player or didn\u2019t have the chops, he just didn\u2019t have the same vocabulary of Blues songs that Jimi did. Clapton could play the Blues he was exposed to in the UK, but Jimi came from Seattle, and had access to ALL of the Blues greats. Jimi had a HUGE record collection of Blues artists, plus there was what he could hear on the radio. I saw Eric in concert with my wife here in Sydney Australia. My wife hoped that he would play some of his \u201cPop\u201d tunes like the hauntingly beautiful Tears in Heaven. Eric played all Blues and my wife, not a Blues fan, loved it. If Jimi had lived he would have experimented with Jazz-Rock fusion, and would have become one of the greatest Blues guitarists to ever live. ",
