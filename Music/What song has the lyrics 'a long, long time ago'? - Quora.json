            "answer_text": "Americans Pie. Artist Don Mclean Aong long time agoI can still remember howThat music used to make me smileAnd I knew if I had my chanceThat I could make those people danceAnd maybe they'd be happy for a whileBut February made me shiverWith every paper I'd deliverBad news on the doorstepI couldn't take one more stepI can't remember if I criedWhen I read about his widowed brideSomething touched me deep insideThe day the music diedSoBye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryAnd them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSingin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieDid you write the book of loveAnd do you have faith in God aboveIf the Bible tells you so?Do you believe in rock and roll?Can music save your mortal soul?And can you teach me how to dance real slow?Well, I know that you're in love with him'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gymYou both kicked off your shoesMan, I dig those rhythm and bluesI was a lonely teenage broncin' buckWith a pink carnation and a pickup truckBut I knew I was out of luckThe day the music diedI started singin'Bye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryAnd them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSingin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieNow, for ten years we've been on our ownAnd moss grows fat on a rolling stoneBut, that's not how it used to beWhen the jester sang for the king and queenIn a coat he borrowed from James DeanAnd a voice that came from you and meOh and while the king was looking downThe jester stole his thorny crownThe courtroom was adjournedNo verdict was returnedAnd while Lennon read a book on MarxThe quartet practiced in the parkAnd we sang dirges in the darkThe day the music diedWe were singin'Bye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeAnd singin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieHelter skelter in a summer swelterThe birds flew off with a fallout shelterEight miles high and falling fastIt landed foul on the grassThe players tried for a forward passWith the jester on the sidelines in a castNow the half-time air was sweet perfumeWhile sergeants played a marching tuneWe all got up to danceOh, but we never got the chance'Cause the players tried to take the fieldThe marching band refused to yieldDo you recall what was revealedThe day the music died?We started singin'Bye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeAnd singin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieOh, and there we were all in one placeA generation lost in spaceWith no time left to start againSo come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quickJack Flash sat on a candlestick'Cause fire is the devil's only friendOh and as I watched him on the stageMy hands were clenched in fists of rageNo angel born in HellCould break that Satan's spellAnd as the flames climbed high into the nightTo light the sacrificial riteI saw Satan laughing with delightThe day the music diedHe was singin'Bye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSingin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieI met a girl who sang the bluesAnd I asked her for some happy newsBut she just smiled and turned awayI went down to the sacred storeWhere I'd heard the music years beforeBut the man there said the music wouldn't playAnd in the streets the children screamedThe lovers cried, and the poets dreamedBut not a word was spokenThe church bells all were brokenAnd the three men I admire mostThe Father, Son, and the Holy GhostThey caught the last train for the coastThe day the music diedAnd they were singingBye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryAnd them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSingin' this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieThey were singingBye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSingin' this'll be the day that I die ",

Lyrics He lived down by the farm houseWhere the stray cats sleep at nightJust a deck of cards, two fold up chairsAnd a ghost of his wifeThe Devil lived in his doorwayKept out the love and hopeHe lived a long long long timeA long time agoHe lost one yellow sunday when he reached into his throatPulled out all the people that he had been and tried to chokeBut together they overwhelmed him and he couldn't help but explodeHe lost a long long long timeA long time agoAsked a man in town and he said he is lonelySaid he was strange and he was all aloneNo place to goHe went up in smokeDo do doooo doooo doooo dooooWell he left in a hurryWhile the cops kicked in his doorHe jumped out the second storyWent do the road and highacked a carStuck his head out the broken window and he howled like the Devil's ownHe left a long long long timeA long time agoAsked a man in town and he said he is lonelySaid he was strange and he was all aloneNo place to goHe went up in smokeDo do doooo doooo doooo dooooHe flew right past the borderHe ditched his car and dyed his hairHe took out his deck of cards for a couple last rounds of solitareAnd he slept just like a babyThough the night was hard and coldHe flew a long long long timeA long time agoWhen he passed through the devils doorwayWell he knew just where he wasHe through back his head and howled s he resigned himself to dustAnd they found him in the Rio Fuerte his body was still afloatHe passed a long long long timeA long time agoHe passed a long long long timeA long time agoHe passed a long long long timeA long long long timeA long time ago Gustavo Woltmann  ",
