            "answer_text": "Assumptions As you have a Netflix subscription and you are reading this answer on Quora you must be aware of IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes. You must be fairly competent in using google search with Keywords - \u201cBest Horror Movies on Netflix\u201d or \u201cBest Movies on Netflix.\u201d Essentially this means that you are looking for Hidden Gems on Netflix India. The shows or movies which aren\u2019t as famous but are exceptional. That\u2019s where I come in, I\u2019m going to recommend movies which aren\u2019t famous. So even though I like House of Cards and Stranger Things very much they won\u2019t be featuring in this list. As I said, these aren\u2019t my favorite movies or TV shows, this are hidden gems The Fall - Let\u2019s kick things up by (one of ) the best police procedural thrillers that I have watched. If the devil is in details then you have a devil right here. Gillian Anderson is brilliant in the portrayal of a brilliant detective (She just owns the show, I rarely rate anyone higher than Castle\u2019s Kate Beckett but she easily outdoes her)  La Mante - One serial killer story to another, British Crime thriller to French Crime thriller. Must watch if you are crime genre fanatic.  On Children - You think your parents put unnecessary pressure on you, wait till you meet the unfortunate children of these anthology series. Each episode is around an hour and half long (almost a movie length) and deals with dystopian future where children are forced to study. You have to watch it believe the horrors of parenting gone too far, but it will be worth it.  Sense8 : This probably is the most ambitious entry in the list as well as most known by mainstream audience. However, I still decided to include this as many of my friends who do watch US based TV series aren\u2019t aware of this. This is a TV series with a great concept, diverse lead cast and beautiful cinematography. I strongly recommend this if you haven\u2019t watched it.  The 100 - Okay, you are looking for a TV series in which main characters can die a horrible death just like GOT (and probably Walking Dead) your quest ends here. Do you think Dragon Queen has questionable moral compass, meet Clarke the lead protagonist of the series for whom the case can be made for most brutal lead character. She has the highest kill-count for any lead that I know of. If you haven\u2019t watched it, this will fill up your time slot nicely while you wait for season 8 of GOT.  I sincerely hope that you got at least one new TV series to watch after reading this, if not let me know I will update the list. ",
