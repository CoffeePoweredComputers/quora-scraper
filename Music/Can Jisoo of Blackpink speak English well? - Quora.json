            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, she can\u2019t speak English as fluent as Jennie and Ros\u00e9. You can clearly see it in Blackpink\u2019s interviews with GMA and Apple Music. She usually stays mute and does not speak that much. Because compared to the other Blackpink members, Jisoo is the only one who was born and fully raised in South Korea. So I understand how hard it is for her to speak in English considering her education background. However, she can read and understand English perfectly. She just can\u2019t speak English well because she\u2019s afraid to mess the grammar and tenses. ",

The other 3 members of BlackPink happen to grow up speaking English: Rose is Korean but was born in New Zealand and grew up in Australia, Jennie was born in Korea but studied abroad in New Zealand for most of her childhood, and Lisa is Thai and English is taught in school there. FYI, it is not require for Kpop or Kpop groups for be able to speak English. ",
