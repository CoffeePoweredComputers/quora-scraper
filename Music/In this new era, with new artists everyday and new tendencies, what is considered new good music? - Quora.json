            "answer_text": "The only way to really answer this is listen to what comes out and just decide what you yourself like. Your taste is just as valid as anyone elses. Ultimately the cream will rise to the top and what ends up being considered good will have legs\u2026that is will still be with us years down the line.

What's good is what people like and sticks with us for more than a minute. If we musicians really knew the answers to this question we'd all be writing all hits all the time\u2026\u2026 and we don't.
