            "answer_text": "There are lots of Easter songs. The Roman Catholic and Church of England hymnals are full of songs about the Easter story. It forms a larger part of the Christian faith than the nativity narrative so it gets written about a lot. There are probably more Easter songs than there are Christmas ones.  But they haven't really crossed over to the mainstream because the imagery isn't as good. Babies born in mangers is much cuter than men dying in agony on bits of wood. So stores have been happy to blast traditional religious carols throughout their sound systems for the entire of December. But nobody wants to hear about Crucifixion when they're shopping. ",
