Is life so intimidating that you cannot ask your peers this simple question? Do you feel like it would be weird or something? Just cuz Chester has passed it doesn't mean LP's music should be put up on a shelf to collect some dust bunnies. Listening to his music keeps him alive in your memories today. Music is timeless. ",
