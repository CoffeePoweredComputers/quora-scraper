            "answer_text": "I am multifandom, so what I am about to say is unbiased (also, this is a long post) Subjectively: People can choose who is the best based on their own personal preference. If their fav is being outsold by BTS, then you are going to see comments about BTS not being the best. If their favs are BTS, then you will see comments that say BTS are best\u2026 Objectively: BTS would be considered the best band of KPop, and I will tell you why: They have out sold the most globally (Stadium Tours, Albums, Perfumes, Games, Merch, etc), and they are the highest paid and most requested KPop act for award/television series, you don\u2019t get there from not being the best of the bestThey have broken many records that other Kpop groups may never even come close to breaking, if at all. Their most recent comeback BoyWithLuv broke 3 guinness world records in 24 hoursMost viewed @YouTube video in 24 hoursMost viewed @YouTube music video in 24 hoursMost viewed @YouTube music video in 24 hours by a K-pop group#BoyWithLuvThey had 3 Billboard #1 Albums within a year (Love Yourself Series), which has not been done since the Beatles\u2026.the Beatles people, everyone knows how iconic they are.They are trending in countries that are considered homophobic and xenophobic. In fact, Saudi Arabia law indicates homosexuality is punishable by death (that\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t homosexuality there), but what I am trying to get at is BTS has been invited to have a concert there. Do you understand the enormity of that situation? That is MASSIVE impact.BTS is also the first kpop group to have a stadium tour and perform in a stadium in the US, and not only are they the first KPop group to have a US stadium concert, they SOLD IT OUT within MINUTES\u2026They also sold out Englands and Frances tour dates, BOTH days. Some VERY popular American artists can\u2019t even do that. Also, this a KPop group guys, selling out different countries stadiums\u2026Wembley alone as 90K capacity\u2026No other KPop group has done that.*Before I make my last point, I want to say the US music market is the elite music market, there is no debate from that. People from all over other countries hope to break into the American music market. So with that being said, let\u2019s get back to the last point: Last point, sure, EXO, Big Bang, Girl's Generation or 2NE1 \u201cbroke\u201d into the American market and were considered the top of the top at one point, but they are not anymore. Not objectively. Also, they did not have the same impact as BTS. Sure, there was KCon, artists did \u201cworld tours\u201d and the US said they liked KPop, but sales were not in the big leagues, they weren\u2019t even in the game compared to US artists. KPop might have been on one week on a late night TV show, a week on the album charts, or maybe opening for a US act, but nothing substantial. KPop success in the US was parallel to Western Success, they never intersected, they never were considered \u201cWestern Success\u201dNow, enter PSY he impacted the western industry in ways other kpop companies only dreamed of doing, but it didn't change the game, his global success was connected to a single parallel song and they called it \u201ckpop western success\u201d, he was the anomaly the big 3 wanted to be, but it wasn\u2019t what we call Western SuccessNow enter BTS. BTS started outselling the Big 3 by 2015, and this wasn't just in SK or Asia, by the end of 2015 BTS was beginning to make their way up in the charts that would lead them to the top of not only the US, but many other untouched countries. But they were still parallel to Western Success up until 2017. By 2017, BTS had built a bridge between the parallel lines of \u201cKPOP\u201d and \u201cWestern Success\u201d and every record they broke made this bridge longer. Once they got a foothold on the side of Western Success\u2026they TOOK OFF. They began to set records far beyond the KPOP industry, they started breaking all-time records and awards noted in global music history.Now for over a year other KPop groups have aggressively tried to walk on that same bridge, but what they have found is that that bridge has already been crossed and can only be forged by the combination of genius-level talent and the most committed fanbase in history, the BTS ARMY (they are free to build their own bridge, but it will be EXTREMELY hard)So what\u2019s the take away? Many other KPop acts never intersected the lines of \u201cKPop\u201d and \u201cUS/Western Success\u201d, the Big 3 just gave the illusion that they did, but BTS ACTUALLY did, this is why they are the best band of KPop, and why they may reign at the top for a VERY long time to come. BTS is not a one hit wonder, and once you cross that bridge of Western Success and establish yourself for real, there is no going back.To be honest, BTS is something other than KPop, their success does not reflect badly on KPop, but you can easily see how their concepts and lyrics are different than kookie (pun-intended) cutter Kpop groups. RM and Yoongi have even stated that they do not want to be necessarily placed in the genre of KPop, and that they are artists who love to make music. I see BTS\u2019 success making KPop common, and what I mean is you go out to a bar and they play Latin music and everyone loves it and dances to it even if you don\u2019t understand what they are singing, that is what I am talking about. TL;DR: BTS is the best band of KPop due to Western Success, sales, and broken records ",

            "answer_text": "As an army since early 2015, I think luck has a part to do with it. Whilst the boys are amazing and play a part in creating their music, it\u2019s the fact that they were different than other groups when they debuted. I don\u2019t tgink they had as many scandals, mostly plagiarism and drama with rappers whilst other groups had romance drama. I don\u2019t know if this is because Bighits girl group had dropped or if they were just more careful, but romance hasn\u2019t seemed to be there. This catches a few eyes already. They\u2019re young men, attractive, fighting towards their goals and almost no drama. Sounds like a dream. This is where smart moves from Bighit play a role, if you\u2019re a kpop fan there\u2019s at least one company you hate. Whether it be SM, JYP, YG, or a smaller company there\u2019s still some disdain. Bighit didn\u2019t put them in a lot, whilst this seems like it would make them less visible to the public, the few appearances they did make drew in hundreds of new fans. Making bangtan bombs made ARMY feel closer to them, as we know idols and fans are almost on different worlds. But with a click of a button it feels like we\u2019re living with them, experiencing what they do. They let us in on how they feel, even when it wasn\u2019t positive. In kpop, I don\u2019t think that happened a lot, maybe now more then before. But having Yoongi (Suga) sing about how he didn\u2019t care who he loved, gender didn\u2019t matter. Having Namjoon (RM), Yoongi (Suga), and Seokjin sing about the unfairness of the school system in korea meant something, them singing about the military rules that they were born into, the things that happened to them as they struggled to make it. It makes me feel closer to them, to know that once they too were just a person in this big world. They make me feel not as alone. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what makes them feel different. That\u2019s how they succeeded. With smart business moves, good relationships in the group and with the fans.  ",
