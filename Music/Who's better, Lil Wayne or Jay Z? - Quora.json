            "answer_text": "Jay Z. I\u2019m not even being a stan. Lil Wayne was a great lyricist and made some good music, but he\u2019s fell off really hard. Jay Z on the other hand has got a little worse as he\u2019s gone on. But he\u2019s said that he dumbed himself down, and he still makes good music, it\u2019s just not AS good as Blueprint or Reasonable Doubt. Lil Wayne is just bad now. He has a good song now and then, while Jay has a great ratio on every one of his albums. Lil Wayne in his prime vs Jay in his prime would be a lot closer, but overall, Wayne gets stepped on. ",

But Wayne\u2019s a bit weird you know, Jay Z is a nice down-to-earth guy. This question can only be answered with opinions mate, not facts. I believe Lil Wayne is better but he\u2019s my fav artist so yea, just my opinion. ",
