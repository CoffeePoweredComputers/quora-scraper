            "answer_text": "My answer is complicated but very real and directed towards those people who know nothing about the intricacies of modern musical performances. I want to make it perfectly clear that any use of an artist\u2019s name is only meant to give an example of the type of performance and DOES NOT imply that they lip sync or don\u2019t. The first factor is what type of performance? Is the artist\u2019s act also predominantly dance as in the case of Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Brittany Spears and other modern pop artists? If so, in a live show environment, there is a good chance that they are singing live along with prerecorded track. The artist\u2019s mic is usually hot at certain times during the performance so they can sing if they choose and talk to the audience. For anyone who thinks lip sync is a rip off and phony, try this at home. Do 50 jumping jacks. Now run around your house or apartment building 5 times. Now do it five more times while singing Happy Birthday out loud. Hard to sing. Hard to catch your breath. Sound like crap don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve heard the obnoxious sound it makes when people blow in a microphone? All of that is why it\u2019s done.In the case of TV performance, especially award shows such as the Academy Awards, Rockin\u2019 New Year\u2019s Eve or Superbowl half time show, everything is scripted to the second. In TV, time is BIG money. It is crucial for the performing artist to adhere strictly to the time schedule even five seconds of inconsistency can cause problems. Often it is written into the contract that they will sync for their TV performance so that show producers can count on the scripting and advertisement air times.I hope that helps. I\u2019ve never met an artist who didn\u2019t want to sing for their audience but many professionals understand the reality and technical challenges of today\u2019s performances. Every artist I\u2019ve ever worked with always wanted to give their audiences the best they could deliver. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a technical challenge to pull off a live show with live vocal performances. There are times when the environment won\u2019t cooperate. It\u2019s too noisy for the performer to hear themselves above the rest of the band, the crowd is cheering too loud, the wind is creating loud blowing noises in the microphone, etc. As advanced as wireless mics have become over the years, there are times when holding a big hunk of metal and plastic in your hand isn\u2019t practical. The little tiny \u2018lavalier\u2019 or \u2018tie-clip\u2019 mics also capture rubbing noises, as the fabric of a costume moves across a performer\u2019s skin. Most of the time, singers who simply stand in one spot aren\u2019t visually exciting. This is why the performer is also dancing elaborate choreography. However, singing is tough enough without running out of breath running and jumping all over the stage. TV borrowed a trick from the film industry, and encouraged the performers to pantomime \u201csinging\u201d to pre-recorded tracks. Recording audio in a studio, an enviromnent designed for the purpose of capturing sound, allows the director and technical staff to focus on the visual aspects: lighting, camera lenses, camera movement and placement, and so on. Most of the time it works\u2026 however, Ms. Carey\u2019s recent performance is an example of when things go wrong. ",
