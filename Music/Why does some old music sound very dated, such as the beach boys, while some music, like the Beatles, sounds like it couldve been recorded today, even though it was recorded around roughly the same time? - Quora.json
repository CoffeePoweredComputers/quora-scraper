            "answer_text": "Crikey, there\u2019s a whole mountain range of subjective reasoning going on in this question! Which characteristics of a musical presentation does the questioner think should be considered in deciding whether it is \u201cdated\u201d or \u201ccontemporary\u201d? Let\u2019s look at The Beatles. The guitar sounds employed by George Harrison are very clean and dry. Most guitar players now would add a little more sustaining overdrive, a touch of chorus and/or delay to sweeten and smooth the sound. The guitar tones immediately identify a Beatles recording as being 1960s era. That\u2019s \u201cdating\u201d the sound, quite literally. The drums are recorded in mono. They are dull and thuddy, and cymbals are quite dull in comparison to a modern recording. Studio technique and technology has enabled far clearer and better-defined drum recording. Usually, stereo panning is used on drum tracks, and reverb greatly enhances the sound now whereas in the 1960s it muddied things up so was avoided on drums for the most part. This dates the drums on Beatles recordings very obviously. That\u2019s just two stand-out characteristics that I listen for to \u201cdate\u201d a recording. I do it a lot because I\u2019m tasked with creating demo recording performed by tribute bands that need to sound right for the era of the band whose music they\u2019re performing. There are effects and styles of effects that are appropriate for different time periods\u2026 and what The Beatles and The Beach Boys used were common effects and techniques that enable us to guess within a decade or better when the music was produced. That goes for other recorded music too - Simon & Garfunkel, The Who, The Mamas and The Papas, Pink Floyd, BillHaley and The Comets\u2026 you name it, they shared sounds characteristic of their era. Moving on\u2026 SOME tracks were/are pioneering in techniques. They get ahead of their time - and that can always happen. The stand-out track for me is Marvin Gaye\u2019s original \u201cI Heard it Through The Grapevine\u201d which to my ears could have been recorded yesterday. There\u2019s very little in there that enables dating it accurately, and that\u2019s clever. However, it\u2019s a personal thing and someone else might disagree because they listen differently. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the others below, that it\u2019s a subjective thing. Also, that the audiences were different \u2026 early Beach Boys was going for a good-time, surfin-n-sun in Cali vibe. The Beatles by 1965 were more into being musical for its own sake, so getting a little more serious you might say (tho it was still heavily boy-n-girl stuff, a good portion of that was about heartbreak). Also \u2026 the old Beatles material has been re-worked, re-mastered, etc. So their old songs sound better now than they did then (sound-wise), substantially better. ",
