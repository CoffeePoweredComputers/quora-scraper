This is a good one, it's a remix but really quite fun to listen to:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaXDr-e_EpU&feature=related \"Tell me When to Go\" by E-40 -- a reference to sideshows and \"ghostriding the whip,\" a move popular and central to sideshows--the title of the song is asking bystanders and friends to tell him when to start riding as they view him hanging from the car.  Make sure you crank this up in your Tercel with the subwoofers in the trunk.
