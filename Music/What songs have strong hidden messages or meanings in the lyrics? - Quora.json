            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really know of any, but there are several that people imagined that there were hidden messages and meanings in them. For Viet Nam vets, they remember songs like The Animals I Gotta Get Outta This Place Peter, Paul, and Mary sang Puff! The Magic Dragon. Lot\u2019s of smokers thought it was about marijuana and the boys in Viet Nam thought it was about a C-47 gunship nicknamed Puff The Magic Dragon. But the writer and the artists say it\u2019s a kid\u2019s tale. There were also direct lyrics for the war in Viet Nam. Steppenwolf\u2019s The Draft resister or Monster, Suicide, America. ( We don\u2019t now how to mind our own business,cause the whole world\u2019s got to be just like us, Now we are fighting a war over there, no matter who\u2019s the winner, we can\u2019t pay the cost.) Barry McGuire Eve of Destruction Edwin Starr War! What Is It Good For? There are many others. There are many songs that when played backwards, seem to have Satanic messages in them\u2026Stairway to Heaven is about the most famous. Queen\u2019s Another One Bites the Dust is another. Summer of 69 is NOT about buying a first guitar in 1969. It\u2019s about the guitar alright, but the 69 is his sexual awakening, using the position as a reference. If you want more, just look on the web for songs with hidden messages. ",
