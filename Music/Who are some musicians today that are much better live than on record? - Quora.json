            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very subjective question. Some people have become \u201cspoiled\u201d by the consistent perfection of recorded music and can\u2019t appreciate when songs evolve with a band, not to mention most recordings have layered tracks and extra instruments played by studio musicians, so the sound is going to differ unless the band is \u201crolling tape\u201d. If you want a no-frills band that just lays it down, Clutch tops my list. Need a little more flair? Try Volbeat or Korn. I\u2019ve never listened to any studio music of theirs, but The Cleverly\u2019s are a sight to see live. Great bluegrass and comedy all rolled into one. Three of the best shows I ever went to were Megadeth, the absolute worst show I ever went to was Megadeth. They all can and will have bad nights. The vibe of live music is something that just can\u2019t be captured on tape, even recordings of the exact performance are not comparable to being there. Go to shows and decide for yourself who you like better live (just remember, one bad show doesn\u2019t mean they suck). If you enjoy the live music \u201cvibe\u201d, odds are good that most artists you like will be better live more often than not. ",

            "answer_text": "Recording studios generally have a larger recording room, separate isolated rooms and a separate room for the recording engineer and sound equipment. They also usually have a selection of high end microphones and recording gear. The rooms are or should be designed and treated with acoustics in mind- parallel walls and corners create audio problems and you'll often see walls treated with materials to deal with these issues. Here's what a separate room might look like: (this one used for recording drums. The wood mounted to the wall deals with reflections you would get otherwise get from a wall that's smooth and flat.  Here's another room used for percussion on this session:  Once these rooms are closed off you can hear little to no sound coming from the drums. Here's a large center room with my stuff set up behind a panel- I've got a small headphone monitor feed coming from the small gray box to the left of the chair. We were recording acoustic guitars on this session and you can't see in this photo but there's another station like this one set up on the far side- the windows let us see each other and see the drummer. The electric bassist was set up between us and used a DI (direct injection) box so there was no bass amp involved  Here's a room in a different studio for recording two guitars at the same time.  So, in a studio these separate rooms are used to create a controlled environment. In the early days, before multi-tracking and digital recording became the norm, ensembles used to have to record with one or two mics to tape. The tape could be edited by cutting and pasting tape (which you can imagine is very time consuming). The controlled environment allows for easier mixing, editing and overdubbing. You can overdub, edit and digitally splice sounds together without changing the overall sound. You won't get coughing, foot noise, car sounds, bird chirps or other instrument sounds bleeding into the track. You can get a very \u201cupfront\u201d sound without much of the room sound itself (reflections). Live recordings have all the issues I just mentioned (maybe not bird noises, depending on the venue). Depending on what you're recording and how, there may be some isolation happening (bass is often DI into the mixer, recorder and thus isolated), some guitar equipment allows for DI as well. Any microphone is going to pick up other sounds from the stage (called \u201cbleed\u201d). This is not necessarily bad as it can add a lot of depth to a recording. However, depending on how much bleed there is the tone of the entire mix can change when an instrument goes up or down in volume. Mixing isn't entirely impossible in a live recording- you can still adjust the close miked volumes of various instruments. Editing can still be done to some extent though it's more difficult. For example, a guitar solo might not be replaceable with a different solo because the sound of the original guitar can be heard in the background of other instrument tracks. However you can replace the track with a new track as long as it's the same notes since it won't clash with the background bleed. You can even fix a few blips here and there if needed. The bleed isn't as loud as the new track so the new fixed sound will overpower the mistake or unwanted noise. You might even be able to cut entire sections of music out of a live track and splice them together in a way that's undetectable. If there's a section of music that's the same it can replace another section if there's some problem sound in the second repeat. Let's say a drummer misses a hit because a hawk flies by his head at the outdoor festival- you can select a good hit from somewhere else and if the bleed is the same then you won't hear a difference. We also try to isolate tracks with EQ and other software in live recordings. Every instrument has a frequency range and by cutting unneeded sounds with a filter above or below this range can help remove unwanted sounds in a track. Anything in the same frequency range is going to come through. Recording live classical music can be very tricky. The noise from air conditioning, cars driving by, foot noises and DJ from a wedding in the next building can be difficult to deal with. The low frequencies from the DJ\u2019S bass sounds can be picked up by the mics even from very far away. I can remove and reduce a lot with software programs but not everything. In the last festival I recorded, I swear it sounds like someone is cracking a whip every so often. I still have no idea what that is or who is doing it. There's also creaking chairs and other random sounds. Next time I plan to bring something to dampen the sound of the chairs\u2026 The feel of playing with a band live is very different than recording to prerecorded tracks in a studio. A live group reacts in the moment to each other's playing and that interaction is harder to replicate if you're building a track piece by piece. There's lots of ways to record in a studio but only one way to record live. Live recordings can often be more exciting and better capture the feel of a group playing together as opposed to a track that's been recorded to a click track in a studio. Here's a clip of he group I play with in a live session recorded by me last year. We're playing amplified acoustics (nylon strings) with internal mics and an isolated pickup for leads (using amplifiers so the rest of the band hears us), bass is DI out from an amp but the live amp tone bleeds into all the mics (reduced with EQ), drums and percussion all miked. The electric guitar is close miked but the cabinet is in the room. The room is a small theater and not treated for sound like a studio would be.  Here's another live clip from our regular gig- I actually added some background noise to the beginning since it sounded too clean. It's the same recording setup.  ",
