            "answer_text": "No, neither is better or worse than the other. They are different. It really is as simple as that. There is some pretty bad \u201cclassical\u201d music just as there is some pretty bad \u201cpop\u201d music; there is some darned good pop music and some darned good classical music. It\u2019s about talent, performance, communication, the composer\u2019s skills and the performer\u2019s interpretation. In their own times, music from composers like Mozart, Rossini, Verdi and others was the pop music of its day. The aria \u201cNon piu andrai\u201d from Mozart\u2019s Marriage of Figaro was the blockbuster, top 40, #1 hit at the top of the charts, for quite some time when it premiered in Prague. People couldn\u2019t get enough of it, so much so that Mozart made fun of it in his next opera, having one of the characters sing the tune with the words \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this.\u201d Verdi forbid the first cast of \u2018Rigoletto\u2019 to sing \u201cLa donna e mobile\u201d in public before opening night, because he knew he had a hit tune on his hands. Sure enough, it was a blockbuster almost instantly. There are many examples of classical music that was the pop music of its day. \u201cClassical\u201d music encompasses a great deal of purely orchestral music, something that is rare in pop music.That is one big difference. But \u2014 pop music generally has lyrics, and is meant to be sung, and the lyrics typically tell a story or set a mood. In that sense, it\u2019s exactly the same as an aria in an opera, although the performance requirements are vastly different. But they exist for the same reason. On the other hand, some pop music works its way into the concert hall. Many of the Beatles big hits have been orchestrated and arranged for orchestra. Same for many tunes from Broadway shows, along with Cole Porter, Rodgers / Hammerstein, Leonard Bernstein, and so forth. But one genre is not necessarily better or worse; I would say if you want to compare, then compare similar pieces from each genre side by side. ",

            "answer_text": "Before anything: In no way I\u2019m downgrading pop. Also, I\u2019m no pro (I\u2019m web developer) but like to make a joke with my friends, teasing them ofcourse - you can\u2019t call Bach and Ringo Starr colleages (there is a huge gap between the time spend and the amount of notes these two dug before we mention them now days). To get to the conclusion, there is two main aspects - composing/writing music and performing music. Classical music may be looked as superior because of: Polyphony and Composition is way too complex and sofisticated (compared to most pop music) - there is strict rules, lots of knowledge and complex structures to master before writing a piece of it. It\u2019s imposible to number all the constraints that classical music piece requires in order to be accepted (before) as such - canons, order, composition, timing, harmony\u2026 After all that preset, you can start evaluate quality.it requires superior skillset (to put it short) in performance. Classical music performers spend almost lifetime in learning and mastering their instruments. It matters a lot - you can\u2019t perfom Rachmaninoff before getting crazy from fighting the piano (most great composers require a decades of training to be performed in public).All that doesn\u2019t makes it better than pop - better music is the one that makes you better. Now to give my answer to your question: Is it better? It is for some people. It\u2019s about listenning: classical music requires a lot from audience (they say: you need to give three chances to opera to fall in love with it\u2026 or not). So - for a good listener, there is no better than a classical masterpiece, because of that deep exhausting satisfaction it produces. One\u2019s preferences are final criteria ofcourse - I don\u2019t enjoy Schnittke (I don\u2019t have the education to even listen properly this guy) as much as Bach (but others do). In any case, most classical music, generally, gives me more joy than pop, I can spend a day listennig Bach\u2019s partitas, but I listen tons of pop (it\u2019s easy) and enjoy it. P.s. BTW: there is Jazz. That\u2019s a heavyweight category for any musician - it requires just-in-time creativity over complexity performance. Many jazz musicians are trained classical musicians and can perform classical music, but usually perfer not to (they get bored). ",
