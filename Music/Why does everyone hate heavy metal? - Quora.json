            "answer_text": "The premise is false, but I\u2019ll answer it as if the question is asking about the genre\u2019s limited exposure in the mainstream, which is also not exactly true, but not as egregiously inaccurate. You can\u2019t passively listen to metal. Fully appreciating it requires an understanding of musical complexity and a respect for artistic exploration beyond the confines of the generic. The mentality of \u2019sticking it to the man\u2019 continues to be a major driving force in the genre, and its seen as one of its greatest charms. That said, such an emphasis on individual expression means much of what\u2019s produced bewilders the casual listener. Metal is a huge genre. That means there are many metalheads out there who are insufferably snobbish and pretentious about their tastes. Like all other major industries, there is a fair amount of douchebaggery. Of course, it would be irrational to dislike a whole genre of music simply for having one obnoxious friend who identifies with it. Some people have no desire to listen to challenging music.Nothing wrong with that. I say it would behoove us metalheads to be less pompous about our tastes. ",

            "answer_text": "Because It's loudIt's in your face, balls to the walls music.Isn't mainstream.Has explicit, philosophical, tongue-in-cheek lyrical content. The lyrics are not meant by catchy.Is dissonant, doesn't follow 4/4 time signature and is offbeat summing up to the fact you can't dance to it.The vocals aren't sung it's screamed or shreiked. But if it's sang then it's almost operatic.Loud distorted guitars, double bass drumming, thunderous basslines all sets up to the aggression.All these factors add up to people disliking Metal music.
