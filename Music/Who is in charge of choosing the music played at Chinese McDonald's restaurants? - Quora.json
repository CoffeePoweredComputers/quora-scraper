There are two ways for the restaurants to get it. Some fancier restaurants have direct access to the music from the headquarters; the other restaurants just play the CDs produced by the Marketing Department. The tempo and genre of the music will be decided upon the time of the day and also it varies among different types of restaurants. For instance, the McCafe will play slow-tempo, elegant-style Jazz music in the afternoons. Of course all the music that McDonald played are authorized editions and we've already paid the Background Music Copyright Fee to the Music Copyright Society of China.\" ",
