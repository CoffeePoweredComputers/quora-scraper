            "answer_text": "It depends on the dye used and if it was \u201cset\u201d or not. Sometimes using 90% rubbing alcohol soak can remove unset dyes. It greatly depends on the dye type and what fiber was dyed for more accurate information. Some lower cost dye brands (such as RIT) have their own dye remover solutions. You can also use a commercial dyer detergent (or carpet cleaner if not available) to remover loose dye off a garment or even a watered solution of bleach with the later being the most destructive to the fabric itself. Hope that is some help to you. ",
