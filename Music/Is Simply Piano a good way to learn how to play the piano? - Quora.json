            "answer_text": "I used a Piano teacher for several months while I was first starting out and I tried Yousician as well as, Simply Piano, piano maestro, Flowkey, Playground Sessions, and Piano Marvel. First, let me give you a rundown of many of these apps. Yousician is lacking in content, but otherwise is just as functional as Simply Piano. Also, I have to say that I recommend them the least, as they are charging extra to access the good songs and that\u2019s a shame as they\u2019re every bit as expensive as the other apps without the benefits of the music. Piano Maestro is good, but some of the instruction comes across as being created to be used by a teacher. Tons of songs and and the family plan is cheap though, so it\u2019s worth owning this one in addition to other apps geared more towards teaching theory and such. With the Teacher, he didn\u2019t really have any more knowledge than buying a music theory book and using Simply Piano\u2026 However, the way he explained things was much more clear than books or even Simply Piano. An example would be intervals, where Simply Piano shows you intervals and books explain them, the Instuctor went a step further and explained how they were useful for sight reading and this honestly improved my reading speed as a result of his explanation. The teacher is also good for correcting the little flaws in your technique. With Simply Piano, I can honestly say everything you need is pretty much there if you want to get good at this instrument. They give you plenty of instruction, plenty of lessons, plenty of songs in simplified, intermediate, and advanced formats. If you do decide to go the Simply Piano route, don\u2019t just brute force your way through everything, instead take your time and play all the pieces they give you, until you master them\u2026 If you do this, you\u2019ll develop good sight reading and finger control. I think about the only thing I wish they did earlier, would be technique\u2026 It seems odd that it is so far along in the course, but at least it is there. Understand that Simply Piano will keep you playing, it will get you comfortable playing, but you will need addition materiel to learn the theory as that\u2019s the place where it is weakest. Another note, Simply Piano has added a feature they call Play (it\u2019s currently in Beta). There were complaints that people found they couldn\u2019t play the music from sheet music after learning on the App, and Simply Piano added this feature to help counter that. It basically gives you sheet music to play and has features where they can teach you the song (using their standard app approach), or scroll the sheet music down at a pace that you set. The only flaws I see in this feature is that it doesn\u2019t listen for you to play and change the page for you, and it is locked to landscape orientation, so you can\u2019t see the whole page on screen at one time. Another drawback of Simply Piano is that it is only available on iOS and Android, where apps like Flowkey can actually be played through a Chromium based browser on a much bigger display (like my 27\u2033 iMac display). Also, Simply Piano bucked the trend of monthly subscription options, so you\u2019re stuck with a minimum of 90 days at a cost of $60 and that\u2019s a real problem if you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re going to like that app after the short trial period. There\u2019s also no lifetime option like Flowkey and Playground Sessions have. Playground Sessions might have more content than most of these apps, but their App is horrendous and the lessons have a lot of unnecessary filler that, I found, made the app less enjoyable to use. Piano Marvel is great all around for technique and content, but they\u2019re a lot like Playground Sessions as they have excess filler and an app that\u2019s clunky (but nowhere near as bad as the playground sessions app. Flowkey is the best of the bunch in my opinion, it actually teaches you a bunch of music theory, has a guide for fingering above the staff so you can see how it is actually played, let\u2019s you pace yourself better than Yousician or Simply Piano, has better music to learn, and will show you how to break down a song for learning. Compared to Flowkey, Simply Piano is little more than a game and risks implementing bad habits into your playing routine. Flowkey will teach you at least 36 of the 48 scales and enough chords to play pretty much any pop song. It will actually teach you chord building and chord progression as well as reading notes and give you some Hanon exercises to develop muscle memory. Also, if there\u2019s a YouTuber that you enjoy watching and want to learn some of their pieces, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re already working with Flowkey and have many songs in the app. Oh and anyone that tells you that you \u201cneed\u201d an instructor isn\u2019t being completely honest, as one post mentioned, your goals will determine if these applications are good enough for you. A quote I recently heard was, \u201cThe best find an instructor, not so they can get 5 or 10 percent better, they find one so they can get 1 percent better.\u201d So, when you reach the point where you want that 1 percent improvement, then get an instructor, until then, try it on your own. I would also like to add that Music Theory is only covered at the most basic levels with Simply Piano, you should avoid this app if you want to learn a ton of theory but use it if all you want to do is get motivated and learn to play.

            "answer_text": "some update (10/03/18) on the answer I wrote below a while ago. Just after writing this answer I reached the end of intermediate 2 of simply piano. It had taken me about a year and a half. It is at this point I realized that the time had come to switch. I went for flowkey that I have been using for about a month. The reason I switched is because I realized that (1) the simply piano method was making me dependent on a very specific way of displaying the score, (2) few pieces are available (3) the writing is not standard, the pieces are very simplified and they keep this silly background music, even with classical pieces I still think that simply piano was a very motivating way to start and it got me quite far, but I would not recommend using it for more than a year or two. I am really happy with flowkey: it is a bit less didactic than simply piano - hence my advice to start with simply piano - but it has many more pieces. The main plus is that you have the hands of a professional playing above the score and it therefore clears any doubt you may have at any point with respect to fingering and finger movements. Also, it is compatible with the Yamaha lighting scheme that shows you which key to play. This feature is a mixed blessing in my opinion: great to start learning a piece quickly but probably a highway to bad habits. I try to use it only when beginning a piece - I do not read music very well and it saves me a lot of time. I then switch it off as soon as I am reasonably familiar with the keys. I know this is a bit disputed, but my understanding is that the consensus is NEVER looking at the keyboard when playing. For instance, in about 2 days, I have managed to play their simplified \u201cclair de lune\u201d, which is quite pleasant. The only downside of flowkey is that it gives you no quantified indicator of your progress, which is a feature I really liked in simply piano. I had heard a lot of good things about playground sessions, but when I tried it, about a year and a half ago, the app was really not great. It looked more like flowkey but a bit less pleasant and I found it very difficult to get anything useful done with it. \u2014\u2014- my original answer starts here I have been using simply piano for about two years now. I am 49 so it\u2019s a slow process. I do not think the app makes things faster but it teaches cords and fingers in a very clear and unambiguous way. Some people are arguing against sliding staff. I would say I wonder who will NOT be using a tablet to read music in ten years. It is just a natural thing to do. Bear in mind that nothing is static in music. Note that I started with piano maestro, which taught me a lot but felt very limited and was obviously taking me the wrong direction including bad habits. I dropped it when simply piano came around and this was a totally different ball game. For a while I was undecided between simply piano and Flowkey but simply piano turned out to be more didactic. The only problem is that I hate their \u2018modern \u2018 orchestrations. I simply turn off my iPad volume not to hear it. So far it has taken me where I wanted. I can play a few pieces in a rather convincing way - I mean with full control - , like autumn leaf or maple leaf but you have to give it a lot of time. I practice everyday anything between 30 minutes to 4 hours. I try to always practice even a few minutes. The bottom line is that it is a slow endless process. You have to enjoy learning otherwise it is not worth it. I estimate about 5 or 6 years till playing the things I am interested in at my current pace. But it is non-linear so it may be faster - or slower\u2026 One last thing initially I started was a cheap keyboard. They told me it was not good enough and that it will give me better habits and all the stuff. But this is all I had and it turns out that switching to a much nicer keyboard about a year and a half later set me back by about a month no more. I think the first keyboard for 100 bucks was enough for me to decide whether I wanted to spend 3000 on a much nicer one. I just got myself a clavinova Yamaha with wooden key and yes it\u2019s great but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t do it before. So my advise: start cheap and upgrade if you think it\u2019s worth it. In any case start with a keyboard pressure sensitive - they start at 100 bucks or so ",
