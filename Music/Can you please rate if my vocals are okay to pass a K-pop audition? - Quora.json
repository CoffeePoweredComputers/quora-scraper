            "answer_text": "Your singing voice is good but when it comes to way you sing , it changes. During singing you have to be relaxed but you were singing at high tones, it also can have a bad effect on your voice. Me also tried to sing the whole song at high notes and I lost my singing voice after it, although I got it back but it took 2-3 months to get back . Try relaxing your body and face as much as you can while singing. Don't work up with your vocal cords too much it harms . Warm up at least 1 hour everyday . Don't sing on high notes if not needed . To find your actual singing voice. 1 . Relax your whole body . 2. Warm up your vocal cords. 3. Take a deep breath ( through nose . Through mouth only while singing) 4. Then do the lowest note you can. 5. Increase notes one by one . 6. Stop at note you are most comfortable with. ( Best with piano or any key instrument) I hope this helped you. \ud83d\udc4d ",
