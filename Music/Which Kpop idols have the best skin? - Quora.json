            "answer_text": "Hard to tell. They all have make up artists who are honestly excellent at hiding flaws and as with most of us they have skin care regimes (I\u2019m sure theirs cost more than mine but mine isn\u2019t cheap or quick!). In Korea the lighter the skin the better the complexion is thought to be (I don\u2019t agree, but I do use more sunscreen on my face than on my body - aging, not fear of tan). If you look super close due to all the makeup all the time their skin is actually worse than many average Koreans and also due to lack of sleep. Make up off, lots of water, decent sleep, and a regimented skin care routine and anyone\u2019s skin can be good (and if it\u2019s not there are spas and treatments to fix that). I find it semi-unfair when people call us vain, in part we are but a lot of that is taking care of ourselves and the skin and bodies we were given. It\u2019s not like we get a new one every 10\u201320 years. There are no do-overs with taking care of your skin, even with treatments ",

Korean beauty is never really heavy and they tend to be more natural. So I doubt their actual skin is far from what you see even with makeup :/ ) Jin  Yoongi  Hoseok  Namjoon  (As I was saying, Maknae Line also has great skin.)    (Besides their live broadcasts, bts with no makeup can usually be found in bon voyage and their summer packages (and sometimes in twt too!) ) ",

NCT Jaehyun: In the 24-hour relay series that NCT 127 did in 2019, we can see barefaced Jaehyun multiple times. His skin is pretty much flawless, despite his admittance that his skincare routine is basically non-existent. In his 10\u201311am video, he showed us that he only uses Toner and Moisturiser (this may have changed by now, but I\u2019m going off of what I know), and if this still holds true then the man must have incredible skin as its very rare for us to see blemishes or acne.     (Here\u2019s the video where he showed us his routine) ",
