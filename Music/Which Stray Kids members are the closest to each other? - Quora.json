I will list a few: Chan and Felix3RACHA (Chan, Changbin, Han)Han and Minho (aka the infamous Minsung)Chan and WoojinHyunjin and I.NHyunjin and ChangbinHyunjin and Han (which is funny, because as trainees they almost got in a fistfight that\u2019s how much they hated eachother)Hyunjin and SeungminSeungmin and I.NChangbin and FelixWoojin and Felixetc. I\u2019d say probably the closest SKZ friendship is the one 3RACHA has, Minsung, or Chan and Felix (as Chan literally called Felix the best australian little brother ever, instead of his actual australian little brother, Lucas) ",
