            "answer_text": "I can't see why 25 years old is too old for a music career. Charlie Daniels of \u201cThe Devil Went Down to Georgia\u201d game didn't get popular until he was twice your age. If you lead a healthy lifestyle, ie. don't even consider tobacco, eat smart, exercise, get some sleep, drink water, avoid alcohol and other drugs\u2026you just made yourself more youthful. There are no absolutes, but there sure are tendancies! Practice, practice, practice! If you truly have a passion to rap and sing you have to do this, and with rare exception you should enjoy it anyway! Rockstar didn't just get a guitar, grow their hair long, and get on stage! I read Keith Richards autobiography, of Rolling Stones Fame. He played guitar all the time. If he got constipated he took his guitar with him to the toilet! He said he's been to parties where gorgeous women were all over him, there was every drug available (maybe piles of cocaine or whatever) you get the idea. Although these opportunities became available as he got famous, he said if he saw a guitar leaning on the wall in the corner, that got him the most excited. Passion! Good luck! ",
