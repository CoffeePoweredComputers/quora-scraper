But now we're getting out of control because of the movie Bohemian Rhapsody that came out. I am now getting tired of people saying that queen are the greatest live band of all time!!!! No that is not even remotely true they had one great live performance at Live Aid that is true however they only played for 20 minutes that does not give them the title of greatest live band. Freddie Mercury is arguably the greatest frontman of all time and he knew how to command an audience however that doesn't make up for live sound. Sorry but the Who are a better live band and they should have the title of greatest live band. And I will prove it with facts as it pertains to live albums Queen live killers versus The Who Live at Leeds sorry Live at Leeds hands down. While Queen may have had a show stealing performance against other legendary bands the Who had several more the Who made an impact with the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock ,the live at the Isle of Wight Festival and the Who also stole the show at the concert for New York which was their version of Live Aid and the who even blew the Rolling Stones off the stage in their own special TV program The Rock and Roll Circus. Now as it pertains to albums come on people you know the Beatles hands down. Queen is awesome and again I am very happy they're getting their much over long deserved recognition but let's not get carried away and call them the greatest band and live band of all time. Freddie Mercury did command and mesmerized the audience but he was one person compared to 3 of The Who members who tried to dominate one another and they also commanded and mesmerised the audience Pete Townsend with his guitar wind milling and leaps , Rodger Daltrey with the swinging is microphone like a lasso as if he was going to rope a member from the audience and the madman himself Keith Moon all over the drum kit which also captivated a live audience.

            "answer_text": "I am a Queen fan but if by \u201cbest band\" you mean \u201cbest ever in the world\" I will have to say, no, not really. The problem with Queen is that their sound, while amazing, contained too many genres for them to be the best in each. Their albums also were not all great. Their 70s albums was certainly much better than the 80s (except for Innuendo) which veered too much into pop category. The album that was really bad for me was Hot Space and that is enough to put them out of the best band contention. Freddie Mercury is the best frontman and as a live band, they are probably the best but if you put in studio albums plus innovations etc, the Beatles is the best band. When Queen is good though, they are very good ( A Day At The Races, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera). One can only wonder what might have been if Freddie Mercury had not passed away. So, I love Queen but I can't call them \u201cthe best band\". Sorry ! ",
