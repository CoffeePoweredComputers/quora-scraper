            "answer_text": "Strange question. All music not connected with god could be said to be secular. If you\u2019re including songs with music then there are too many \u201csecular\u201d pieces covering too wide a number of styles and subjects to generalise about characteristics. The only meaningful characteristic for secular music is that it is not about god or religion. Discussing the characteristics of sacred music makes sense on its own, but that isn\u2019t what the question asks. Asking about the characteristics of secular music is like, for example, asking about the characteristics of music not-concerned with love. All you can really say to that would be that the characteristic is that it doesn\u2019t concern itself with love. ",

            "answer_text": "Since Bach\u2019s secular cantatas sound like his sacred cantatas and Mozart\u2019s requiem sounds like his other compositions, it would seem that key, tempo, time signatures, etc. are the same. Other examples; \u2018What Child Is This\u2019 is the same song as \u2018Greensleeves\u2019 and \u2018People Get Ready\u2019 sounds like other Curtis Mayfield compositions except for the lyrics. Even lyrics can be virtually the same, i.e. they can praise England or a King or America or a person (Fat Boy Slim\u2019s \u2018Praise You\u2019. ",
