On the app, each ad will give you 2 bits. On a computer, you will usually get 5 or 10, but will rarely get 15 or even 25. Other than that, I do not believe there is any other way to get free bits. ",

However there is a survey system Twitch has called Twitch RPG, it often awards 500 (though sometimes less, sometimes more) bits after you complete a survey. It will take a while for you to access these bits, but they are free! ",
