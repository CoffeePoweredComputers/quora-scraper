            "answer_text": "My personal favorite QR song is Take Hold of the Flame off of their first album The Warning. Operation Mindcrime is a concept album that is amazing start to finish. It is well worth the listen but take that one on when you have an hour to kill. It is way better when absorbed as a whole concept. Rage for Order has some great songs like Walk in the Shadows and Screaming in Digital. Empire is another great album with some really string material. Their latest self titled album is really well done and harken back to their original sound. Their new vocalist Todd La Torre has the chops that Geoff Tate used to have without sounding just like him. There are several albums in between Empire and Queensryche that have a song or two that work but overall I don't care for them. ",
