            "answer_text": "Honestly, I am not by any means an expert, but it saounds like you are \u201ctone deaf.\u201d In no way do I intend to be mean or insulting. But I did not even recognize the song until I recognized the lyrics. The actual notes on the scale that you are singing do not correspond to the notes of the song. Tone-deaf people have the ability to enjoy and love music, but not the ability to replicate what they hear by using their voice. My husband is like that. He is a big music lover, but knows he can\u2019t really sing. His difficulty with other languages may be related- he says the words with an overwhelming American accent, not trying to mimic the pronunciation of a native speaker. It\u2019s kind of the same thing, as he says the correct words (\u201clyrics\u201d) but not the correct inflection (\u201cmelody\u201d). I do not know if you can be trained to hear what notes you are singing better. Perhaps if you played a line of the song, then of you singing it, and recorded all of it, you may be better able to hear where you are not hitting the notes and staying on pitch. But even if you can\u2019t get one bit better, keep singing! Singing brings me joy, and I don\u2019t care how good or bad it is, but how much fun I have when I sing. I hope you feel the same way. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know this song, but here are some observations. You seem to know the song pretty well, so what might lead you to have such trouble replicating what you heard? Maybe-you might do better if a pianist was accompanying you. That could keep you in the right key.you might do better if you relaxed your throat more and tried to sing just the notes, rather than put in the style and emotion. I would love to hear you sing Happy Birthday with someone playing along at the piano. I think that would tell me a lot more. A tense throat can put you off-key, so can all the glottal stops (uh-oh) you are making, likewise attempting vocal ornaments you don\u2019t really understand. Try singing a simple song with accompaniment. (By the way, my late father had a nice voice, and plenty of choral singing experience, but there was one place in one song, where he would always go into the wrong key, and always by the same amount.)",
