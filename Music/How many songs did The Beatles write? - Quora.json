            "answer_text": "Wikipedia lists 237 songs written by The Beatles. But, I just read Mark Lewisohn\u2019s \u201cComplete Beatles\u201d chronicle, and Allen J. Wiener\u2019s \u201cultimate recording guide,\u201d which lists virtually every song they ever did. Let me tell you that there are many songs that were never released! So, if you count them - how many would there be. There also TONS of solo songs by McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and even Ringo that were recorded but not released. There are FILMS that were shot and never released - all kinds of scripts that were ordered, written, and never saw the light of day. I think you will find most artists have works they don\u2019t release because they don\u2019t like them, never finished them, etc. So many unfinished little gems of history waiting to be discovered some day \u2026 ",
