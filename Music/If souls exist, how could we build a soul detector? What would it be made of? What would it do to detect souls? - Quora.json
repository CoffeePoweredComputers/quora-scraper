            "answer_text": "The ghost-hunters, I rather suspect, have already solved the hardest part of this problem for you. So building a soul-detector is actually going to be a rather simple problem, in the end. What\u2019s a soul-detector going to be made of? *blink**It\u2019s going to be made of silicon, copper, and plastic, of course. Transistors and resistors and capacitors and batteries and wires and Arduinos and microcode. I\u2019ve actually started a little project of my own to build a soul-detector. Hmm, perhaps I should start from the beginning. Ghost-hunters report a phenomenon they have dubbed \u201cbattery drain.\u201d Ghost-hunters are fixated on audio and video recordings of so-called \u201csupernatural\u201d phenomena. (Which are actually completely and entirely natural, but let\u2019s not open that can of worms.) They really don\u2019t see anything else. So when they are doing an investigation and get a call that supernatural phenomena have been observed happening at a certain location, they get all excited and go running at top speed to the location and point their cameras at it. And their cameras stop working. (Not every time. Just occasionally.) This, as you might imagine, is frustrating in the extreme. Here they\u2019ve spent all this money and done all the hard work of getting everybody organized and equipped, and it\u2019s 4 oh-damned-o\u2019clock in the morning and everybody\u2019s loopy from being up so late, and then they start seeing EXACTLY what they came to see, and they go flying to the location and point ALL their fancy, expensive equipment at it so they can prove to the whole world they\u2019re not the lunatics most people think they are\u2014\u2014AND THE TRIPLE-DAMNED FANCY EXPENSIVE GADGETS STOP WORKING! But then it gets WORSE. They drag the gadgets off somewhere else to see just what the hell is wrong\u2014AND THE DAMNED GADGETS START WORKING NORMALLY AGAIN! They can\u2019t find ANYTHING wrong! (First off\u2014\u2014I have to observe gadgets, even electronic gadgets, don\u2019t do this. They don\u2019t stop working and then start working again. When electronic gadgets bust, they STAY busted, just like mechanical gadgets do. The only way for an electronic gadget to start and stop like this is for the parts to be EXACTLY the same while it\u2019s both not working and working, i.e. it\u2019s NOT the parts that are changing, it\u2019s something else in the environment Certain physical constants are changing, I suspect, and the electronics are NOT evolved to handle that change (unlike nervous system cells, but that is ANOTHER can of worms), and they stop working. Until they\u2019ve been moved to an area where the physical constant is at the value they were designed around, whereupon the electronics start working again. Which would give you the observed results.) The ghost-hunters say the gadgets don\u2019t actually shut down. What happens is they see a voltage drop. Since a low voltage under normal circumstances means the battery is almost empty, they have been thinking the battery has suddenly been drained, and so have been reporting the phenomenon as \u201cbattery drain.\u201d Frustratingly, while the ghost-hunters (the good ones) rule keep meticulous records\u2014they have NOT documented what happens when they see \u201cbattery drain.\u201d It\u2019s an aggravating thing to them, a failure, and so they don\u2019t record anything. (These guys\u2019 hearts are in the right place\u2014-but trained observers they are NOT.) I have asked them if remember charging the batteries after a \u201cbattery drain\u201d event. (I\u2019m not a ghost-hunter. Staying up until 4 in the morning would wreck me.) Nobody knew. Oh, well, I get to start from scratch. But when it comes to building a soul-detector, I sorta think the ghost-hunters have tripped over how to do it. They have found the detection principle, the most important part, a drop in voltage and current in electronics, maybe batteries. I have decided to investigate the phenomenon myself. I have contacted a local ghost-hunter group and started teaching myself basic electronics. I am going to build voltage-and-current logger. I will attach a charged battery and some random electronics to a camera maybe three feet away from the logger. (Have to keep the logger electronics out of the soul-field. Can\u2019t have that shutting down too.) We\u2019ll see what happens next. Probably be a statistical thing. Probably have to have a hundred of these things out there to get any usable data. The ultimate goal will be to nail down exactly what\u2019s going on and then build a soul-detector around it. And then I will have the ability to do a REPRODUCIBLE experiment. A soul-detection experiment anybody, not just me, can do anywhere, anytime. And then the world will change like you would NOT friggin\u2019 believe. Wish me luck.

            "answer_text": "It is best to understand what the soul is and then you will understand that your questions may not apply because many speak of the soul without really knowing what the soul is. What is the soul? Everything that exists is a vibration of energy which includes the soul. The human is part of the soul of planet earth and we each individualize that soul which consists of four lower bodies representing the elements of the planet which are, fire, air, water, and earth. The soul consists of unique vibrations of energy, respectively, of the identity body (fire), the mental body (air), the emotion body (water), and the physical body (earth). The four lower bodies interact with each other and the energies of each can become unbalanced in the material realm resulting in karma. All souls (persons) are subject to the law of cause and effect based on thoughts and actions which becomes karma. Karma is neither good nor bad but provides the opportunity to learn the truth about oneself. The identity body represents the super-conscious mind. It is how we identify ourselves in the material realm regardless of the name given at birth. It is the higher mind that links to higher realizations and provides guidance for the conscious mind. The mental body represents the conscious mind; it is how we think in order to conduct ourselves in the material realm of form, time and space, and linear thinking. The emotion body represents the sub-conscious mind; it is the seat of memory, desire, and feeling, and causes action. The physical body represents the unconscious mind which operates the body functions such as the heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and the healing of cuts and wounds, etc. When the life leaves the body upon so-called death, the mental, emotion, and the physical bodies decompose. The patterns of the mental, emotion, and physical body of the lifetime is stored in the identity body to be used for reincarnation of the soul. In most cases, the soul is allowed to reincarnate until the lifestream makes the ascension to a higher realm with no need for a material body that needs a soul. ",
