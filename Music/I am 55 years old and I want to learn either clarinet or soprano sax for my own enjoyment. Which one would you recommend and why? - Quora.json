            "answer_text": "Firstly, good on you for not letting age be a barrier. I\u2019ve taught people your age and older in sax and clarinet and they\u2019ve found it rewarding and have produced good results, though be aware learning an instrument takes time and persistence so understand while results will come, you\u2019ll have to be patient. In terms of which of the two, in my opinion it, depends on if you have any previous musical experience. If the answer is yes then either, just choose the one you like the sound of. If this is your first instrument, steer clear of the soprano sax which for complicated acoustic reasons is very hard to play in tune (even professional sax players can struggle with this). If you\u2019re sold on playing the sax, tenor or alto sax are inordinately easier to play so start there. There\u2019s also a lot more material around for beginner alto and tenor than for soprano (though you could at a pinch play tenor music on a soprano sax) and there\u2019s regular chairs in bands for alto and tenor (and of course clarinet) but not soprano so opportunities to play with others as you learn abound. So, I\u2019d suggest if you\u2019re serious about soprano, learn on an alto first. Another factor is what music do you like. Yes, you can play classical music on the sax but there\u2019s much more for clarinet and there\u2019s clarinet chairs in community orchestras you could aspire to. You can play classical music in concert band transcriptions but generally the sax section doesn\u2019t get as good parts as the clarinet does. (I\u2019ve played professionally in wind bands for 25 years most as principal clarinet so I do know a thing or two about this) if you want to play jazz then it\u2019s pretty much sax all the way but for the reasons mentioned above steer clear of the soprano until you\u2019ve had got experience on the alto or tenor sax. That said if you\u2019re a Dixie fan then clarinet might be the go. From a cost point of view you can get a much better clarinet for the cost of an entry level soprano sax. There\u2019s lots more clarinets in the market (I\u2019d reckon the average music ship would sell ten Clarinets for one Soprano Sax). There\u2019s more Alto and Tenor Saxes around of course but generally they\u2019re more expensive than a clarinet. of course if you\u2019re sold on the Soprano Sax then ignore the above and go for it. Music is about self expression so if you like the sound of a soprano sax then that\u2019s all that matters. Good luck and happy playing ",

            "answer_text": "In the beginning and intermediate stages the sax is an easier instrument to play than the clarinet. As you advance however you learn that all instruments are pretty much the same in difficulty. You can - and I have known people who do - spend 6 hours a day practicing the diatonic mouth organ. (Diatonic means that the normal notes on the instrument are the notes of the scale only. This is why mouth organ players who play diatonic models need a different instrument for each key.) On the surface it would seem that the mouth organ is easier but trust me, even this can drive you mad with frustration and take all your time. Of the saxophones the soprano is the hardest; playing in tune becomes more of an issue with the smaller saxophones. Most people start off on the tenor or alto. You will learn that the sax and clarinet are what we call transposing instruments. The soprano sax is in Bb, as is the tenor. For this reason soprano sax players usually also play the tenor. In fact most play the tenor primarily, adding the soprano later. The reasons are many but a big one is that the soprano is a solo instrument. It isn't found in sax sections of bands. In many cases it is an elitist thing. I would seriously encourage you to learn either the alto or tenor and add the soprano later after you have got the basics down. Better still, learn the clarinet and double on sax. Many players do this. It boils down to what you want to accomplish and what do you like the sound of. Clarinet is more popular in classical music and traditional jazz. ",
