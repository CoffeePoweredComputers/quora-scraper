            "answer_text": "First at all I'm black. I am black and don't understand the hate GOT7 becomes. They are a sincere and really hardworking group that deserves EVERYTHING. At the point of Bambam saying the N word. He sincerely apologized. He really didn't knew this word. It was 3 years ago or something like this. Bambam is quite good in English but before he wasn't that good. He just said the n word because a friend from Mark told him that it means something different. After this incident Mark unfollowed most of the friends he has spent time with at this day together with bambam. He apologized really sincere..he was just an innocent boy back then and I think that it's really mean to say that he did something wrong (a long time ago) for what he sincerely apologized. To Jackson. He knows how and when to apologize and at this point he really didn't had to. At this time he became so much hate for swearing dreadlocks for an ADVERTISEMENT. It was Pepsi by the way. He didn't deserved that hate and told the haters that they were wrong if they think that he hated the black culture or discriminated it. He actually has respect for the black culture. Jackson is really open minded. Jackson also became hate because of black facing but he sincerely apologized and understood that he was wrong. Many people also hate GOT7 because of jacksons personality. Thet found jacksons hype and funny side annoying. But what's wrong is that they really think that Jackson is just like this. Tbh are this only people who are enjoying GOT7s reality stuff. In real life Jackson is bright but he is also a hardworking person and he is more thoughtful and serious then funny and bright. GOT7 did some mistakes at the past just like every other group (for example Bts, Exo etc). But they didn't apologized for things that they didn't do wrong. That's why GOT7 is one of the most honest idols. Some group members would apologize for everything (even if it wasn't they fault). If GOT7 thinks (and they were always right) that they didn't do anything wrong, they talk yes, but they don't apologize. GOT7 apologize really honest and sincere and not fake. If they do something wrong THEY WOULD EVER APOLOGIZE. So to hate them for past things and not to see how mature their become is just wrong! These boys doesn't deserves it. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do I start on the bandwagon hate for Got7? The poor boys. Oh, okay let\u2019s start with the N-word bullshit. As the previous responders have said before, BamBam didn\u2019t know what it meant and was told that it meant something else so he used it. Also front that New Years V-live where they thought he said the N word (he clapped back) and he just said JB was getting old (Jaebum\u2019s Birthday is on January 6th). Mind you, I am Black/Indian/ A whole bunch of other stuff, literally we don\u2019t care if you say that word. (Edit: Excuse me, I no longer mean this statement at all. I suppress my own individual opinion because there is no point in arguing with ignorant people. I am my own person. No it is not okay for people to say this word, regardless of background or race. It\u2019s just stupid. Yes, I\u2019m fucking black) I\u2019m surprised no one is talking about it but the biggest thing that I think ruined their chance at being really popular was JB being homophobic. Long story short, Yoo Youngjae and Jaebum were on some show and they went into a couple\u2019s cafe. Apparently Jaebum seemed uncomfortable and Youngjae said something about holding hands or whatever to which JB replies, if you touch me I will beat you up. Thus sparks the theory he is homophobic (accusations from people who\u2019ve never listened to the band or ever checked them out were the first ones to share their opinions, lol) and should be canceled. Since only Jackson had an Instagram at the time, they attacked his comment section because of it. Spark #2 was when JJP was about to come back and a mistranslated article was circulating about how Jinyoung said that he really loved JB to which his companion clarifies the love as platonic. Again, idiots who don\u2019t care for them were the first to share. I think everyone chooses to forget this, it wasn\u2019t a nice time and I think everyone began to boycott Got7. \u00a00:00-0:30 Yeah, he\u2019s definitely homophobic. Jackson being racist which is the stupidest argument. From the fake blackface which was edited from a fan, to the dreads in the Pepsi commercial, it obvious that he\u2019s fucking racist. Yeah, because racist means the same thing as cultural appropriation. That\u2019s the most I can charge him with and CA doesn\u2019t mean that your hair is in a certain hairstyle, seriously girl. Everyone selectively remembers when RM from BTS had a mf perm and dreads and no one says shit but when it\u2019s Jackson it\u2019s now a problem. Okay! (Edit: I stand by what I said. It\u2019s not cultural appropriation, period.) And finally, Mark\u2019s asshat friends. I don\u2019t know too much but his friends got kicked out of a venue cause they were drunk and causing a ruckus in a public area. Then the lying to BamBam. There\u2019s some more but yeah you\u2019d have to look through that. Look, they\u2019ve grown up. They\u2019re not little boys who don\u2019t know anything. They\u2019re men who deserve a second chance. Majority of the hate they get are just bandwagon people claiming they know but they don\u2019t. Especially with their music (which I think is actually pretty good, they\u2019re now my bias group and I love JB so much). I think people need to just get over themselves. (I\u2019ll edit later with screen shots) ",
