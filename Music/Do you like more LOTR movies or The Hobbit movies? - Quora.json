            "answer_text": "The Lord of the Rings trilogy Is far batter and truer to the books than the Hobbit. The Hobbit makes me cringe. The first films were ok apart from the stupid elf dwarf love story and then came the third film with the aweful battle were they completely hammed up the tragic deaths of Fili and Kili which took so much from the story they were not killed like this, they gave their lives to shield Thorin and yet they were given such ignoble deaths in the movie. Oh and one of my pet peeves smaug was a dragon not a wyvern and there is this trend in movies to use wyverns and call them dragons but Smaug had four legs not two. And talking of Smaug, his death at the hands of Bard again they robbed Bard of his spectacular achievement with the ridiculous broken bow and cast iron spear arrow thing. There was so much potential here for a wonderful movie and they took it and made it a soap melodrama with more ham than a Danish butcher's shop. ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer the Hobbit movies. I love the adventure and the friendship. Smaug design is so perfect and it is played by my fav actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The battle is so awesome and the extended versions a must. Beorn house and Rhosgobel are really cool, not to mention to see more of Bag End. I happen to love dragons and dwarves to it is natural to like this movie a lot. I love LOTR also but I find Gollum such a pain, there is so much emphasis on him. It is well played though. Mumakils and Minas Tirith are wonderful and the Rohirrim charging on Pelennor fields bring me tears. Lets not forget Treebeard, cool design and the last march of the ents also bring me tears lol. I feel better after watching the Hobbit. ",

But Jackson stayed true to the spirit of Tolkien\u2019s story. The Hobbit franchise is just offensive, unnecessary and badly done. I pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. ",
