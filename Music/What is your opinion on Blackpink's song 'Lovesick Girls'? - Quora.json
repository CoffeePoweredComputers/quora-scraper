            "answer_text": "Personal opinion: I loved it. In my opinion it\u2019s their best comeback after AIIYL. This song was such a serve compared to HYLT and Ice Cream. I was expecting the worst after Blackpink\u2019s recent songs, but this one managed to knock me off my feet (and I\u2019m not even a Blink!) I\u2019ll be rating the comeback in different categories: visuals, song, dance, styling, etc. Please remember that this is only my opinion and I am not in any way enforcing it on others. Visuals: 8/10 Overall analysis: This is one of my favorite videos from Blackpink. This time they really put effort and a lot of work into it. What I liked The visuals were surprisingly beautiful, and they were filmed outside. Finally, it wasn\u2019t just cheap CGI sets. And the video was so aesthetic!         I loved that this music video was different than all the other Blackpink songs. It wasn\u2019t just a \u201cKill This Love 2.0\u201d or \u201cHYLT 2.0\u201dTheir acting was so good. Especially Ros\u00e9\u2019s and Jennie\u2019s.     What I didn\u2019t like No offense, I didn\u2019t really like Jisoo\u2019s random running scene. It also didn\u2019t really make sense that Jisoo was the only one without a \u2018boyfriend\u2019. Song: 9/10 Overall analysis: This song was great. I loved it! It was a great concept with great lyrics, verses, and rap. What I liked There are so many things I liked about this song. For one, Jennie finally gets rap.Ros\u00e9 is finally given main vocalist treatment.Lisa gets to try a new rap concept and is given vocal lines. Her vocal lines were probably some of my favorite parts of the song.Jisoo has a freaking HIGH NOTE! (Not that high, but still.)Fair line distribution and center treatment.Very, very catchy song. And not just catchy, it was actually good! I\u2019m currently listening to it on repeat.It was an actually sung chorus, not just a beat drop and some onomatopoeia.Jennie and Jisoo had a chance to write some lyrics.The lyrics were so deep and meaningful. Here\u2019s some of my favorite lyrics:I\u2019m nothing without the pain We were born to be aloneBut why are we still looking for love? I\u2019m happy with this pain You pity me, but I pity you more for pitying me Jisoo and Jennie have great potential in songwriting! What I didn\u2019t like To be honest, I found the chorus somewhat repetitive. I also didn\u2019t like that it was sung by all of them; I would have preferred only one person at a time.Jisoo still didn\u2019t say \u201cBlackpink in your area,\u201d but at this point maybe that\u2019s never going to happen. Perhaps Jisoo herself agreed that her voice wasn\u2019t right for it.Other than that, the song was a bop.Dance: 3/10 Overall analysis: I dislike the choreography. Of course, I haven\u2019t looked at the full dance yet, but from what I saw it wasn\u2019t my style. What I liked The dance wasn\u2019t just 2 minutes of shuffling around, like a lot of their songs.All the members got an equal chance at center.I\u2019m glad that there wasn\u2019t a rushed and unnecessary dance break.What I didn\u2019t like The dance just wasn\u2019t my style. It had a lot of hand movements, which I personally don\u2019t prefer.I would have liked to see a harder dance showcasing Ros\u00e9 and Lisa\u2019s talent.Styling: 6/10 Overall analysis: The styling was good as per usual, but it wasn\u2019t great. It definitely wasn\u2019t the best, but I don\u2019t mind. The song and visuals more than made up for it. What I liked I was living for Lisa\u2019s black hair and makeup. Overall the girls looked great.  What I didn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t really like the outfits. They didn\u2019t seem to complement each other.  Personally, I don\u2019t like Blackpink\u2019s heavy makeup looks. However, Maeng did such a better job compared to HYLT and Ice Cream that I was blown away. Conclusion: 8/10 All in all, this was a great comeback from Blackpink. I\u2019m not a Blink, so this is not a biased review at all. I think that Blackpink has great talent and visuals that were showcased in this comeback. What do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "Remember this article? French News Channel under fire for their short documentary about BLACKPINK, ends up insulting TWICE Personally, I didn't give much thought to the issue. As wise people say, it's always better to stay out of stuff that you'd most likely end up wasting time on. However, it did make me quite upset, for it brought up the decades-old \u201ccute\u201d versus \u201cfierce\u201d argument again. Apparently, to some people, the former means submission to the stereotypical female role that has been forced upon women for thousands of years, whilst the latter stands for women empowerment. In other words, falling in love, which Twice made good use of in their past titles from Cheer Up to Fancy, is a trend from the past that a bunch of Asian girls are starting to follow with the rise of Korean pop. On the other hand, Blackpink, armed with their concepts that are far from being What is Love?, is the revolution, the trendsetter for female pop in the oh-so-conservative continent of Asia. You may call me overanalyzing. Before you do that, you have to understand that what I felt wasn't only about the particular documentary. The media, especially the Western one, was obsessed about Blackpink's fierce breakup songs telling the ex to back off, that they were going to shine by themselves even without a guy by their side. A twisted sense of\u2026 \u201cwomen empowerment\u201d, I suppose. The thing is, love was never meant to be submission of any sort. It was never supposed to chain you in any way. Healthy relationships are actually a nice thing. A girl can be cute for her lover, if that is what she wants. I admit, the lyrics for some K-pop songs, such as Cheer Up(\u201ca girl shouldn't give her mind so easily, because that will make you like me more\"), could be viewed as sexist, but that does not mean that every single cute concept can be looked down on.  Blackpink's breakup songs were nice. Their fierce girl crush concepts suit them well. But I simply had to love the fact that Jisoo sang this part: I don't hear what you say I'm happy for this pain You pity me for being like this but I pity you more She literally said, \u201cf*ck off\" to whoever calls being in love a waste of time.  I simply had to love the fact that Blackpink used their international fame and popularity to send a message that being lovesick isn't something you should be ashamed of. You're the only thing I need in my world Even if it hurts, I'm okay if I have you Since when did K-pop have to be about \u201cloving yourself(I'm not saying this is a bad concept-it's just that your faves singing about love for themselves and not for their lovers is. not. something you're supposed to brag about. It doesn't make them any superior or whatsoever.)\u201d or some other \u201cdeep issue\" that isn't about relationships to be truly recognized as \u201ca meaningful piece of music worth listening to\"? I would have had the exact same feelings about Fancy had it been about Greenpeace. Hayne Kang's answer to What\u2019s your least favorite TWICE song? Let them sing about falling in and out of love. Stop bringing groups down for only doing \u201cshallow\" concepts. It's K-pop, for goodness sake. It's just a genre of music. Although I'm quite sure many K-pop fans, including me, have fallen too deep, there's actually nothing so deep about this. Once again, we should acknowledge that Blackpink has a huge influence over many people. I'm happy that they stepped out of their comfort zone and showed everyone that you don't have to be alone to be strong. And in such beautiful lyrics, too! Jennie and Jisoo really did outdo themselves.  Now, this is only my take on the lyrics. They might have a totally different meaning underneath, a much deeper one. Maybe I'm a delulu who is simply fed up with the double standards K-pop groups, especially the females, have to put up with. I don't really care, because I'm quite satisfied with the one that I found. In conclusion, Lovesick Girls was\u2026 actually pretty good. It didn't sound like the typical title that Blackpink would release, but I'm guessing that particular fact acted as an advantage to the song. To be honest, my expectations for Blackpink had plummeted after the release of HYLT, so this may be a biased opinion. But who cares, this is my opinion, so it can be biased to whatever extent I want it to be. Oh, and I loved Jennie and Ros\u00e9's acting scenes\u2026 and from what I've seen, it looks like I'm not the only one. But I loved Jisoo's running scene even more. Don't even ask me why. Wait, I think I can explain. It has been a while since I saw any mainstram girl group running like that-hard-in their music video. I was surprised in a pleasant way. Same goes to Jennie and Ros\u00e9's acting scenes that I mentioned earlier. It's rare to see raw emotions like that these days. The music video in general was a huge step-up from HYLT. HYLT, even with all its fancy decorations and expensive sets, was pretty meh to me. Some scenes of Lovesick Girls did remind me of PWF, and the gas station part looked basic enough, but I'm glad that they dropped the overly done backgrounds and let the members' visuals stand out more. The choreo was totally not my style\u2026 and did you notice that THE ALBUM has three songs that have literally zero Korean in them? Ice Cream barely escapes, because it has about eight seconds of Lisa rapping in Korean. But I'm not going to talk about that here. Lmao. I started writing this answer just because I wanted to make my first point, not the other ones about the music video and such. But You Never Know has very nice lyrics. I'm quite certain I didn't misunderstand those. I think it's the first time Blackpink sang about something like that? You might want to check the song out.  And whoever has the original version of this photo, I would appreciate it if you kindly left a comment. Okay then that's it. ",

            "answer_text": "LOVED IT ! I really did enjoy the song a lot! . Tbh , I never had any expectation,I mean I never have any expectation from any song and I like to be surprised, but after hytl and ice cream I was kinda sad cause I really didn't like that surprise but this one really moved me. MV I loved how it started with chorus , which actually made it really catchy and makes us sit at the tip of our seats . The sets really gave me a gr8 vibe , it makes us connect with the song and resonate with it. Especially starting off with Jennie's car scene was a gr8 thing tbh. Their ACTING, my god . I never expected them to be good actors , cause I've never really seen anyone act except jisoo and ros\u00e9. But this time even Lisa and Jennie were nice too .   Yeah her acting was on point \ud83d\ude09.  The thing that she does with her eyes \ud83d\ude33.  Ros\u00e9 can be a gr8 actor if ever she enters that field, I can really get that fierce energy from her.   Duh! Everyone knows she is an amazing actor. And she did a gr8 job this time . Especially that water scene was like damn. CHOREOGRAPHY:we haven't seen the entire choreo yet but , I think this one will have a gr8 moves. From the chorus part I really get good vibes that the choreo might be bop . SONGit was Hella catchy. Especially the chorus. Lisa's and Jennie's rap was so good it had good flow. And also Jennie got rap parts which I'm happy abt \ud83d\ude0a. Sry I wrote a lil abt rapping cause I like vocals more than rap. Coming to the vocal line, both of them aced it. Ros\u00e9's voice was seriously so good. It fits the song So perfectly, especially the tub scene lines ( sry for this kinda reference \ud83d\ude05). Jisoo's voice too suited the song so well , her high notes were too good . The vibe they gave through their vocals really sticks with me due to its mould with the music. I loved the part where jisoo and ros\u00e9 sing together. The deep and the high tone just mixed well. LYRICS:idk wheather I've interpreted right or not cause I'm not a lyrical person . If lyrics are good and deep I appreciate it but when I listen to a song I specifically not look into the lyrics. I just see the lyrics when I want to understand the meaning, especially in Korean songs I see lyrics most of the time cause it's difficult to sing \ud83d\ude05. When I saw the lyrics and went through it , it kinda gave me this vibes like from happy to sorrow. Even the MV potrays that. First they talk abt how they r stuck then they talk abt leaving it , it went through like a slide of emotions , I think . If I'm wrong correct me as I told I'm not good at this. And one more thing , the fact that jisoo and Jennie are involved in the song writing and also in the production makes me feel more connected with the song. COSTUME/ LOOK :blackpink are really very fashionable and have a artistic + aesthetic kinda costumes in MV The things I liked the most JENNIE :  Jennie's bangsHer ponytail in the MVHer beretHer entire set of costumes were cool especially the oversized fur jacket.LISA  Her hairdo here in the poster.Her spikes jacket stood out as hellThe costume she wore in the first verse gave her a swag rapper feel \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25.ROS\u00c9  Her pink hair colour hands down was so catchy in the entire MV.Her costumes are the most that really potrays this MV. It flows from cute , swag , chill and badass .Her makeup too went through a gr8 transition from light to darkHad to add this somewhere, I liked the scene where she breaks the guitar and on the other hand it did break my heart due to my abundance love for guitar \ud83e\udd7a. So mixed feelings abt that \ud83d\ude02 .JISOO  I loved jisoo's costume the most in the MV . It stood out the most to me especially.. This one , she looks like a goddess here. Her makeup too went through the same transition I loved the lightest makeup here in this scene. And this costume too was very catchy. She didn't have any colour in her hair it was natural. But I loved her black hair.Finally , this comeback is a BOP! I think the , \u201c THE ALBUM\u201d itself is a bop  I liked all the songs . Except hylt and ice cream. Actually even ice cream was very experimental, but hytl was very recycled. Anyway , I think teddy did a good job this time also don't call the songs slow . I personally didn't see anything \u201cslow\u201d in the songs. The girls really worked very hard and it shows. I wish them all the luck. And this , their first full album was \ud83d\ude09 EDIT : I didn't say anything negative cause I really wanted this answer to be positive and happy.  Complementary from my side \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc9c Thank u \ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "Tsk nope. It wasn't that good. Like I liked Ice cream more than this one. It's too repetitive. I didn't get satisfied, I expected better. I understand why people say it was good it was their first album so it only deserves love, but I couldn't take it. Like I expected better YG. What was this?? Jennie and Jisoo got finally to take part in writing, is THIS what they have? Seriously?! Okay whoever believed on all that I wrote above\u2026 \u201c\ud83e\udd21\u201d True it didn't quite reach my hopes, but I couldn't expect anything more or better after listening to it. I've written an answer about my expectations and blablabla. Yoo Taeyang's answer to What do you expect from Black Pink's first album? But I don't care about them anymore. The song and MV was soooo much different and unique from what I thought! So yeah, that means I LOVED IT!\ud83d\ude06 (\ud83d\ude02 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0644\u0644\u0647) (Sorry for answering so late, I was listening to the whole album the whole yesterday\ud83d\ude05) But I won't make this long, it's pretty short. (I didnt have the time to make GIFS to my points or screenshots, I'll just rush write it okay?) MV 10/10 I absolutely loved the MV! They definitely worked alot on this one. The MV fitted the song perfectly. Their visuals, the colors, the aesthetics, each members acting parts (especially Ros\u00e9), it was a mixture of hapiness with love and the sadness of it. And they finally didn't have backup dancers, it was only BLACKPINK choreo!  This part was my favorite! The background is so beautiful! I'm speechless\u2026  Each member had a memorable part, they all were focused equally on. They all stood out. Lisa with short hair and her rap scene and the part where L\u00f8ren and her were hugging. And Jennie's intro acting part and her bags and the doctor part and the other cute one? And Jisoos part on the colorful flowers and her running part and the water/rain/tears whatever that was, was my favorite. And Ros\u00e9, Ros\u00e9s parts were so good and she could make a good actor I think. However I thought she would go for blue hair again, but I got surprised seeing her with PINK!\ud83d\ude0d Song 9.5/10 Ros\u00e9s and Jisoos bridge is stuck on my head now. I can't stop thinking about it. I absolute loved their vocals. Jennie's intro was amazing and Lisa's rap was different and I'm happy to see her go for other styles. And Jisoos first pre chorus, I cried after the song thinking of how much she finally took part in this song\ud83d\ude2d And Ros\u00e9s parts in the outro, I could hear a small highnote in the end\ud83d\udc40 Oh and let's not forget our Main rapper Jennie finally getting rap lines!! It was short but it was rap and she's gooooood\ud83d\ude0c Choreography ?/10 I can't judge that now. I'll do it after watching them preform it. Line distribution 10/10 (Honestly the best line distribution I've ever seen of bp even though Jisoo got the least)  It was fair to be honest. Lisa and Jennie had 2 solo parts. And Jisoo had 3 solo parts. And Ros\u00e9 had one of the most lines, I haven't counted how many parts but yeah. It doesn't have to be equal bit for bit. This is perfect as it is\ud83d\ude24 Screen time distribution  Again not that much of difference\ud83d\ude09 I hope you agree with me or disagree with me whithout jumping or attacking me on the comments. Stream LSG\ud83d\udc98  Oooo my favorite b-side was probably Bet you wanna. Probably! Idk they were all good! Okay now bye ",

Sidique Rodney's answer to What are your expectations for Blackpink's upcoming \u201cThe Album\"? A vocal centered chorus. We got an actual chorus. It's not onomatopoeia. There's lyrics this time. It's such a refreshing change from Blackpink, I'm really happy to see it. Knowing the Jennie and Jisoo participated in writing the lyrics, I'm really proud of them.If not a vocal centered chorus, a rap from Jennie. Jennie had a rap. Even though it's short, she's getting a chance to showcase her rapping after so long, and proving why she's the main rapper.Adlibs from Ros\u00e9. There wasn't any adlibs but I'll look over it, because she has a lot of lines, and the chorus was vocals.A dance break without backup dancers. This song didn't even need a dance break. The ending is free and fun, similar to As If It's Your Last.*Edit: The dance practice is out and now I'm upset. There's backup dancers at the end. It's a bit disappointing to see, as I they didn't need them in this choreography. In my opinion, if there's no moves that you actually needed backup dancers for (BTS- Dionysus, Chungha- Play, or Everglow- La Di Da for example), it's unnecessary. They didn't add anything new to the dance, they just felt part of a set. No more walking in choreography transitions. We haven't seen the full choreography of course, but from what we've seen, no walking. In my opinion, too much walking can be visually boring. I really would like to know who choreographed this dance, you have my respect.Blackpink having fun with it. We'll have to wait for the performance for this, so I'll update it soon.Other things that I really liked: The line distribution seems to be pretty fair in my opinion. Jennie and Lisa evenly split the rap, and Jisoo and Ros\u00e9 sang the prechorus, and bridge. Stunning visuals, and sets as usual. Blackpink never disappoints with their music videos. Lisa's rap wasn't her typical \u201cin your face\" rapping. She toned it down a lot, and she's showing her potential. I love that she's tried a new style. Beautiful vocals from Ros\u00e9, Jisoo, and Jennie. I did not expect to see Ros\u00e9 with pink hair by the way, she rocked it. ~~~~~ I don't think it's possible to be disappointed in this comeback. Stunning job from Blackpink, and YGE.  Stream Lovesick Girls!~ -From a tiny island far away, Sidique. ",

            "answer_text": "No offence\u2026 but I see this song screaming SOTY all over. Blinks might not be the biggest fandom, but if you ask me, compared to other comebacks I\u2019ve gotten this year, this is one of the few songs that screams SOTY SOTY SOTY!!!!!!! Literally everywhere. I\u2019m a multi fandom but this was just\u2026 WOW! MIND BLOWING! UNEXPECTED! THEY REACHED PAST OUR HOPES! Now, let\u2019s start. Lyrics: The lyrics were on point. It\u2019s rare of BLACKPINK to have lyrics like this. It was very very very nice of YG to give Jennie and Jisoo credits for helping to write the song. Jennie was also a producer. You could read the sub titles, and get overwhelmed with emotions. MV: PERFECT. I mean, it gives me vibes of different seasons. You could see how the girls really enjoyed themselves. And their acting, along with Jisoo\u2019s race! It was just amazing. Their facial expressions! When Jennie fought with the guy in the car! When Rosie got abused by that guy who made her cry and I could punch him in the face now\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude00. Next time, he won\u2019t make my Rosie cry. Vocals: Okay, can we talk about their freaking vocals?! It really stood out well in the song. Rose\u2019s voice was absolutely a chef\u2019s kiss. What about Jisoo\u2019s bridge? That was amazing. Rap: Wait a damn minute. Wait a damn minute. WE GOT BACK MAIN RAPPER JENNIE! It was on point! Of course, I can\u2019t forget Lisa\u2019s rap! Like it was so swaggy, cool and too much to handle. Lines and Screen Time Distribution: Okay, even if Jisoo (my bias) got the least lines, we should be satisfied. Like it was very pretty much fair. The gap wasn\u2019t much. Also, I\u2019m so happy that Rose got the most lines! LIKE Y\u2019ASS GURL! MAIN VOCALIST! SHE DESERVED IT! Overall, this is one of; if not Blackpink\u2019s fairest line and screen time distribution. Catchy: DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN?! Like I\u2019m so addicted to this song. I\u2019ve played over 60 times today. Not even for the purpose of streaming, for the purpose of the masterpiece! This is by far really catchy, I was jumping like a kid when I heard it. As for their album, it was very nice. My favourite songs were You Never Know and Lovesick Girls. If I could describe this in one word, it\u2019ll be: P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N! Can we talk about the fact that Jisoo said Blackpink in your area\ud83d\ude0d?! AFTER 4 YEARS, YG LISTENED TO US! WE SHOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL. I want to say a big thank you, to YG ENTERTAINMENT in general, and BLACKPINK. This is for sure one of the best, greatest and memorable day in 2020. P.S, The likes to dislikes, even haters enjoyed it\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Anyways, Bye~\ud83e\udde1 ",

            "answer_text": " REEE I WAS LATE BY 9 HOURS WTFF \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Hi guys I\u2019m back from my two day break (more like, 26 hours, but we\u2019re not gonna talk about that) ._. Fortunately, Blackpink released a new MV, Shawn Mendes did too, Sasha Sloan just released new album, Twice and BTS will too. So, yay happiness upon me.  Anyways, I honestly think Lovesick Girls is one of my new favorite songs. Maybe it\u2019s because I needed something depressing I could relate to even if this wasn\u2019t a depressing song. SoOooOOo  MV: It sort of had a \u2018Stay\u2019 kind of atmosphere but not a junior version and had its own original vibe so I\u2019m happy.They all looked like they were having fun so that\u2019s a bonus.And rapper Jennie\u2019s back :OI really liked all the different settings, aesthetics, and outfits. So pretty ;-;    It made me feel kalm and at peace, not the intimidating kind of look Blackpink is known for.Oh and all 4 members keep having glow-ups while I\u2019m over here, looking like a constipated turtle.Song: At first, I couldn\u2019t really feel the beat or understand the chorus until the part came where it was just them saying, \u201c~~We are the lovesick girls~~~\u201d for a few seconds straight.Again, this is probably my new favorite Blackpink song because now I finally have an anthem to represent my miserable love life.The lyrics weren\u2019t really harmful, just talking about how toxic a relationship can get. And that they\u2019re strong, single, independent women.Even if the lyrics were a bit harmful, it\u2019s not like somebody will suddenly go and be like, \u201coH bLacKpInK sAnG abouT beInG iN pAin sO i\u2019LL bE in PaiN fOr nO reAson tOo. HmMmmMmm sO fUn.\u201d I haven\u2019t researched so I don\u2019t know much, but when I read this: I sorta got worried because not having a lover doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re alone. You can be single but being alone is like, nobody is with you in your most depressing times. Being alone is pretty scary and sad-Maybe I\u2019m overthinking but I was also reminded of the dating ban for some reason. It\u2019s like mafia boss YG went like, \u201coUr GirLs wiLL nEvEr dAte aNd tHiS is PrOof.\u201dAnyways, lyrics weren\u2019t that bad. It got more deep than the last ones and a lot of people can obviously relate.And yeah, the song was good too. Catchy as always\ud83d\udc4cOH AND THE ALBUM IS OUT OMG AKSFDAJKSDF IM DYINGG FINALLY AKLDSKKSFDKSKFDAKLFDS. hehgheghe Dislikes I wasn\u2019t holding high hopes or expecting something better, so I\u2019m pretty satisfied.Sorry I don\u2019t keep up with life, let alone the K-pop world, so I forgot what everyone wanted for this MV.It exceeded my standards, so I don\u2019t have much to complain about. YaYyyy, stream Lovesick Girls for clean skin and prosperity.  ",

            "answer_text": "I just watched the MV. I was 10 minutes late lmao I want to express my dislikes and my likes - yes I do have a few things that I didn\u2019t like but overall it was a pleasant experience. Lovesick Girls - Blackpink  DislikesBy the title alone I already guessed it was going to be about love, break up and a toxic relationship and it was made extremely obvious through the MV and lyrics as well.I do not like the lyrics nor message. Not because I don\u2019t find it essential or important, but because I\u2019m kinda tired of topics about relationships overall. I know Blackpink is the type of girl group where their main message is love and relationships which make them in a way generic and lack of uniqueness in that area.I watched this video and just decided to shut down the lyrics and mainly focused on the MV and the music itself.Of course if you are someone who just experienced a break up or struggles in a relationship, this might be your anthem and who knows, it might help you. But personally, I dislike the same toxic relationship stories BP and most kpop groups tend to put out now a days. I rather hear mumble rap than listen to a song where its lyrics are\u2026..like 70% the same as others. Thankfully most of the song is in korean so good thing I\u2019ll forget the lyrics and won\u2019t understand them later on.They could have changed the formula of the song a little more because it is too predictable who will start the song, who comes on second, who will sing the chorus, who raps, who raps second, who sings the bridge, etc.\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38 LikesNow, I am very satisfied with the song itself. It is quite different than what they have put out ever since they released D4.They experimented in a way and that shows a little bit of growth. They let go of that BP signature sound that they had for a so long.The MV was low key. It was not your typical glamorous sets and backgrounds, the ones that make you think or say, \u201cthis is so YG\u201d, which was refreshing and great to see.The MV felt a bit more rawYou can see the members genuinely had fun and actually seem happy.Jennie and Jisoo has some creative input and no matter how much they worked on, they were still able to take some type of control in their own music and help come up with something that was fresh for Blackpink. And it sure as hell turned out to be a solid and great piece of work so f*cking FINALLY and kudos to them \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffbThe outfits were so much better oh my god! For some reason I look at Blackpink and I think, \u201cthe more raw and real, the better\u201d, - I\u2019m not much of a fan of their sparkly and over the top outfits.The song was too good, I don\u2019t care about their choreo even though a choreo shouldn\u2019t really fit this type of song that much.I give this song an 7.5/10. I\u2019m not too crazy about it but I really really liked it! The hope I had for these girls was satisfied and although I have not listen to the album, I also hope it\u2019s just as good or even better.Congrats to blinks for having another comeback and a chance to enjoy more music \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf38  Pee pee pa pa ca kachow ~ ",

            "answer_text": "Ew, wtf no. it sucked. who tf would like Lovesick Girls? ha jk, me. the song was amazing, I loved it. The song was/ had good: Catchy- c\u2019mon, its catchy. admit it. the chorus isn\u2019t used as repeatedly, but it still gets stuck in your head.Lyrics- ok, read the subtitles, the lyrics are amazing. They\u2019re so meaningful with expression and emotion in them. That\u2019s amazing, we all know that blackpink hasn\u2019t always had the most meaningful lyrics, but Love Sick Girls\u2026 wow.MV- OMG, the MV\u2026 i dont even know what to say. It\u2019s so beautiful, it\u2019s so elegant, it\u2019s so blackpink. The colors, the theme, the makeup, the outfits, everything! The MV rlly has everything. It goes well with the song and it is visually pleasing.Autotune- now, if you\u2019ve seen my opinion of Dynamite, you know im not a fan of autotune, but Love Sick Girls, didn\u2019t have that much. The soon to be iconic line \u201cWe are the Love Sick Girls\u201d did have quite a bit of autotune which wasn\u2019t very pleasant. Overall, the song was natural and im glad autotune wasn\u2019t overused.Rap/ Vocals- this is my favorite part, WE GOT MAIN RAPPER JENNIE BACK! and, we got english jenlisa rap. c\u2019mon you can\u2019t ask for more. and rose and jisoo, vocally the song was decent. rose\u2019s voice fit perfectly with the theme and jisoo got a decent amount of lines. GOOD JOB YG, U DIDN\u2019T SCREW UP!In conclusion, I frikin loved it. I\u2019m not a blink just a casual listener, but blackpink rlly pleased me. it was completely different from their usual style and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. This is was like Playing with Fire + Stay, except 10 times better.  Thanks Blackpink! ~ meow_soph ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be honest. I dislike Blackpink in general. Their songs all sound very generic, and they are repetitive enough that because I don\u2019t like one, I don\u2019t like any of them. Their dancing and the way they are presented overall just comes off as very suggestive to me, and I feel like they try very hard to be seductive. I think the girls are talented, but I don\u2019t like the way they are presented as a group, nor do I like the content they produce. BUT I liked this song. It was very different from all of the other content they\u2019ve produced. The music video had some scenes outdoors for once, and the shots felt more human to me, rather than the intimidating, \u201cbad girl\u201d concept they usually go for. I enjoyed the shots of the girls in fields of flowers, Rose crying, and Jisoo dripping with water. Their dancing and the overall way they were presented was way less seductive. They weren\u2019t trying to shove their bodies down your throat with revealing outfits or suggestive dancing. And lastly, the song. It didn\u2019t come from the same mold as all of their other songs. The song sounded almost bittersweet to me, and I found it catchy and refreshing compared to Blackpink\u2019s other songs. The lyrics were still about a breakup, which is what the majority of Blackpink\u2019s songs are about: relationships, boys, and breakups. But the lyrics at least weren\u2019t a \u201cbetter off without you\u201d type, they were a more honest confession of being fed up with love and the pain that comes with it. In short, I really liked this song, and I enjoyed how the music video was way different than everything else than they\u2019ve produced. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly I am really very impressed. So the first song that came out was HYLT and not only that the music didn't appeal me ,but also the controversy regarding keeping the statue of the Hindu deity Ganesha on the floor had disappointed and enraged me.The only thing that I liked was the beautiful mv(YG mvs are literally the best) Ice Cream was the second song and the only part that I loved was Jisoo's part.The lyrics were\u2026..umm\u2026\u2026let's not talk about that but I don't think BP had really slayed \u2018pink's concept. Again the mv was quite good,the girls were even looking good and hats off to them filming in such a way that the first-time viewers can't guess that they are actually doing so in different places . And finally let's go to \u2018Lovesick Girls'. I didn't like it, I LOVED IT. This is the first time I liked the lyrics of a song by BP.The song was catchy,this time the vocalists shone more than the rappers and I liked it. As always, the mv was lit.Both Rose and Jisoo did amazing. Lisa's rap was cool as usual. Jennie's rap after the chorus might have been a bit off,but still she was wonderful. BLACKPINK REALLY SLAYED THIS TIME. However there was one problem:   Imagine working damn hard to for a song,and when you turn to YT you find these\u2026..Come on,if you don't like the song, fine, but why don't you mind your own business?Blackpink don't deserve this. I hope someday Blinks get rid of these toxic Blonks; the girls are doing great and so are the Blinks. ~Peace\u270c ",

            "answer_text": "Well, honestly when I first listened to this song I was so touched especially during jennie's rap I could feel the lyrics and I was deep in it. And the way Ros\u00e9 & Jisoo's vocals shined out for the first time. Jennie & Jisoo participating in the songs, is a rare thing to expect from YG, but this time they actually did it!  \u2022The lyrics were relatable, cheerful but at the same time chill & cool. There wasn't any \" bara bing, bara boom, boom, boom \" or \" Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum \" and nothing felt extra cringy like usual. No, empty empty choruses! In fact chorus part was really touching \"Yeah we were born to be alone, but why we still looking for love...\"     \u2022No more Jennie & Friends! Finally, feels like they are BLACKPINK and not Jenie and friends! It seems, the favouritism towards Jennie doesn't exists anymore and the girls are being treated equally in terms of outfits, lines and screentime!\u2661\u2661\u2661  \u2022Everybody got to shine in their own way! This doesn't always happen in Blackpink videos, but I can see everyone standing out with their own charisma, eversince \" How you like that \" era. And Jisoo's visuals are not a joke!     \u2022Ros\u00e9 finally got the lines she deserved.  Sometimes, I always found Jennie's vocals kinda cringy especially in \u201cplaying with fire\u201d , but Istg eversince \" how you like that \" era Ros\u00e9's healing vocals are really made this song! This is the most faired line distribution by BLACKPINK and Ros\u00e9's vocals felt original! I SIMPLY LOVE THIS SONG! Didn't expect this B.O.P from YG. This srsly deserves a SOTY!\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc97  ",

            "answer_text": "Song and tune: Personally, I absolutely adore the song especially since it is different from their recent songs. But I don\u2019t now if it\u2019s just me, but the song can fit in as an English song and I can see it being sung by Charlie XCX or someone with that vibe. MV : The MV was pleasing but, the sceneries from the beginning and the end of the song were so beautiful, I wish they have added more of scenes shot in that place. Choreography : Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know that with the tune of the song and all, it must be extremely difficult to choreograph it, but the chorus choreography looks like it was edited into the song, it looks out of the place. But then again. I haven\u2019t seen all the choreography yet. Lyrically: The lyrics was a banger, that\u2019s all I have to say. Members focus Rose : The song was for Rose, Rose was made for that song. She uplifted the whole song. Her vocal for the pre chorus of the first verse was so so good. She makes the whole song a lot better, she filled in the song with her unique tone so well. Jennie : Jennie\u2019s rap was short but lit. Jennie\u2019s raps are like high-end luxuries with a limited product. She ending the song was a whole solid gold. Jisoo : Okay, anything aside, did you see how beautiful she look? Her visuals was out of this world. She at least got more lines than the previous song which is so satisfying already. Jisoo\u2019s vocals in the bridge sound so good btw. I couldn\u2019t imagine any other members singing that part. Lisa : Lisa\u2019s part was satisfyingly catchy and beautiful, she really shines there, but other than that, as the whole song, she really did not shine much to me. But then again, nobody really outshine each other this cb. Anyways, Lisa\u2019s part in the first verse was one of my favorites in the song ",

I give LSG an 8/10 i really liked it, not only that but, jennie and jisoo should participate more into making there songs!  Tbh, i really hate the type of songs with girls getting out of breakups or love songs that\u2019s dedicated to a boy or something or the kinda songs \u201d i love you, you left me\u201d type of things the \u201c im heartbroken, i dont need your love anymore\u201d Yeah, but i gotta give a smile to blackpink for this since it\u2019s their first album so for me it\u2019s a pass, i\u2019m waiting Blackpink, show more of you\u2019re talents :D!

If one thoroughly goes through the lyrics, one will realize that this song is SO AWESOME, SO GOOOD!!The music is so GOOD! The part where Jisoo and Rose sings alternatively before the chorus is the best part according to me.HANDS OFF TO RAP-LINE!! Each and every word of the rap (by both Jennie and Lisa) has made me spellbound! There\u2019s such a deep meaning.The visuals!! OMG, Every clip is worth being watched and embraced. The girls look just THAT gorgeous. I\u2019ve already set their best pics in the MV as my wallpaper and lock screen. ^~^Finally!! Like FINALLY!! Jisoo said \u201cBlackpink in your area\u201d in this mv!! YG has finally listened to us!!! BTW, they just took this \u201cBlackpink in your area\u201d to the next level in their song \u201cPretty Savage\u201d of The Album. I was just awestruck by the way they started their intro with the iconic line \u201cBlackpink in your area\u201d in a completely new and amazing way!!! To the ones who didn\u2019t listen to their \u201cPretty Savage\u201d till now, just click the link below and am pretty sure you\u2019ll LOVE it! ^0^And last but not least, the storyline of their MV and each and every member\u2019s acting skills!! Am not saying that this is the first time BLACKPINK showed off their acting skills, but IDK why, in this MV, they really just kicked our ass with their mind-blowing acting\u2026I mean, the part where our Rosie fought with that guy (I mean acting) and cried was the best part, in my opinion. AND storyline was like SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD\u2026Whenever I listen to the song, I really feel the story and the music. It\u2019s both rocking and soft\u2026It\u2019s indeed PERFECTION!! (UP) Pretty Savage Full Song. SO, That\u2019s it.. BTW, Did anyone of you think that who the guy was in their \u201cLovesick Girls\u201d MV?

Also her bridge was so gooood\ud83e\udd7a. Its so lovely and her pink hair ugh. Please stop dying it but she looks good tho. Not to mention the choreo is actually pretty good, the one where they kinda pat their head is iconic. I love the MV and them so much.

            "answer_text": "It was a refreshing break from their previous releases I'll give them that. And to top it off Jennie and Jisoo helped in co writing the song so that's a plus. I was surprised by the title track. However I didn't like it. Sorry. For me it sounded like early 2000s Disney pop from Camp Rock. The song itself didn't have any defining factor. It wasn't as catchy as their previous songs either(which we all know is Black Pink's defining factor, atleast till now). I don't think the song was quite ready or finished. It seems kind of childish and what some amature producer will have thought of for their first song, I hoped to enjoy it since it was diffrent, and I realized that diffrent doesn't actually mean better. Its can be diffrent and still be disappointing and that's ok. But the lyrics made some sense. Finally. I would've preferred their other song, You Never Know as the title track. It would've give the some depth. Like, something more then just aesthetics or cool beats, something with meaning. But I guess they're doing quite good. Congratulations for the first full album in 4 years Blinks\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude05. ",

I haven't liked BLACKPINK\u2019s recent songs like ice cream and HYLT but I have to say that this one is a BANGER. I really liked Jennie's vocal , she really gave it her best and of course rapper jennie was on Fire. She just surprised me like it was just another version of her. Lisa was also good but her rap was nothing extraordinary like it was the same style as the other songs Rose was outstanding as always, her vocals were also on point. Jisoo\u2019s vocals were really nice too and she has improved a lot . The lyrics of the song were the highlights\u2026its just so different from their recent ones. It's written by Jensoo so it really had a different vibe to it. So I've to say that it's a pretty good song. ",

Not to exagerate but that is the only lyric or line that i dont like. Considering blackpink has a big image and popularity, implying some message in their lyrics should be thought throughly, i mean so many people even kids watch them and hear their music and what if the line \u201cWe were born to be alone\u201d influences some kids, and even as an adult, that line itself is wrong in so many ways.

One of their most memorable eras. ",

More than the song I was worried about blinks reaction to it because of the Hylt and ice cream situation but the song surprised me with being really good. The vibe the song gives me are the best. To me it feels like listening to a song you were obsessed a few years ago and remembering old memories. It somehow feels really nostalgic. The lyrics make perfect sense and it is clear what the song is about. Visuals were very pleasant to look at. And the beat definitely hits me. I was not expecting this. Blackpink does not have a lot of songs you can hear at calm rainy night but many parts of the song you can. The rap is so catchy. \u201cx's and o\u201d remind me of as if it's your last. Overall I can say I like the song which is very rare when we are talking about blackpink. So great job!  ",
