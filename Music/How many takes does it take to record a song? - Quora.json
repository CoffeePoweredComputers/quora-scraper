            "answer_text": "Q: How many takes does it take to record a song? A: Anywhere between 1 and some very high number. But \u2018takes\u2019 isn\u2019t exactly defined. This is because in most studio recordings, different tracks are recorded at different times. A typical recording might have everybody playing run-throughs at the same time but only the basic tracks (in other words, drums and bass guitar) are saved from a good run-through. Lead guitar, rhythm guitar, keyboards, vocals, etc. might all be recorded later with multiple takes each. Plus, it\u2019s very common to punch in for just a section of the song to fix a bad note, or get a better solo, etc. Vocals are often doubled, or recorded multiple times and the best little bits taken from multiple takes. So, to count \u2018takes\u2019, do you add up each time the \u201ctape\u201d runs past the \u201ctape heads\u201d (physical or virtual) with at least one track being recorded? That would make the number of takes very high indeed\u2014hundreds would be common, thousands or tens of thousands in some cases. Here\u2019s a short transcript of actual events in the studio, which relate to this question: Me, talking into the talkback mic: \u201cOK, folks, let\u2019s do a practice run-through of this song from the top just to warm up. I want to make sure all the levels are looking good.\u201d Band: plays brilliant take of song. Band: \u201cThat was GREAT! Feeling good about this. OK, are you ready for recording now?\u201d Me: \u201cNope, not necessary. I was recording that and it was perfect. Great feel. We can move on to the next track now.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "As many as you want. It really depends. It depends on how you\u2019re feeling, if your voice is warmed up and your throat is clear, etc. When I record a song, I usually do it with a goal in mind of how I want the recording to sound and what stylistics choices I want to make. Sometimes I can\u2019t decide, so I record a bunch of clips of me singing that song in different styles and experiment with different tones and voices, and then choose my favorite one to post. For me, I usually record and post 30\u201360 second covers to Instagram. Since I often record several covers at the same time, my time spent recording everything is pretty long. Usually I sing for 1\u20132 hours (with breaks), experimenting with different sounds and styles, and end up with about 40-60 clips total. Then have to listen to all of them again, pick out the ones I like, and delete the rest. Again, it depends. The reason I have so many retakes is that I know what I want in a recording, and I want it to be as close to that vision as I can. EDIT: I took a look at Mr. Roger Still\u2019s answer to this question and I think I misunderstood your question. I\u2019ve never been to a recording studio, but I remember watching a small documentary or interview about a singer (forgot who it was) and they said they had very limited time. That\u2019s my entire extent of knowledge on recording studios, sorry. ",
