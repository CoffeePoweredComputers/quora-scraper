            "answer_text": "I believe Steve Winwood is in a place in his life where he can enjoy performing with people who he has known and admired for years but never had the chance to collaborate until recently. I don\u2019t think he actually quits his bands, but if they don\u2019t have a project in the works he will create one and get guys who he thinks fit the bill. I met him in Santa Fe, New Mexico during the Spencer Davis Band days. He was not quite 20 at that time, but just by speaking with him you could tell that he has limitless musical energy. ",
