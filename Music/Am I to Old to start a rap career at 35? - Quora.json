            "answer_text": "Well there's a couple questions you have to ask before doing this\u2026 Do you have a job?Do you have a family?Do you make enough to sustain both? (If you have both)When 35, most people expect a man or woman to be dying down and having a family. But that's Societies view, not yours. If you have a sustaining job that gives more than 6 hours of free time, and if you make enough to pay your necessaries and extra, then I'd think there\u2019s no problem to have fun and rhyme a little bit. But if you have a family, you have to be responsible, make sure to always pay more attention to your children, wife, dogs, cat, imaginary friend, whatever seems like family, than anything that involves rapping. Being 35, I honestly don't think it'd be a bad thing, you're older which means you have experiences and stories that you can rap about. Just know it's not easy to make it into the game, lots of people crash and fall, but the way to win is to get back up and try again. (And think about the cash if you do make it). Anyways, good luck dude, hopefully in a year or two I see ya on the front page in YouTube! ",

            "answer_text": "LoL!!! The answer is NO! You are not too old, but the journey could be a lot more difficult for you because of age. But, the truth is you can do it, have fun, and make that jump exciting for yourself! How? First you need to know that because of your age psychology you will have your own drawbacks because you think others will make an issue out of your age, but that's not true. Some people will, but most people won't as long as your music is 'DOPE'! On that subject of making dope music, you are going to have to believe in yourself wholeheartedly, no holding back on yourself! Also, you will need to be honest with yourself and accept constructive criticism. A lot of older artist fall off because they don't practice on their craft, therefore ending up sounding dated with their style(s). Don't let that be you! Due to your age you have a great amount of wisdom, therefore you will be able to get things done faster, easier, and more efficiently that most of your younger counterparts. There will be challenges so be prepared to prove yourself as all artist have too! Check out this artist Spherm Banks \u266b \"Live from My Smartphone!\" - Spherm Banks. Listen @cdbaby This guy is a prime example of what I'm talking about, he did it with a smartphone and is getting airplay! ",
