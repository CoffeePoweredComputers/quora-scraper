I thought I would pick a dog theme for illustration\u20143 tunes from the Fifties. The first is \u201cHow Much is that Doggie in the Window?\u201d by Patti Page. It topped the charts in 1953. This is what White America was used to hearing. Meanwhile, the black community was doing \u201crace music.\u201d An example is \u201cHound Dog,\u201d by Mama Thorton, 1952.

African songs became Slave Spirituals, these Spirituals became Gospel music, Gospel music branched into Jazz, Blues, R&B, and Soul. Rock and Roll is a combination of All of the genres mentioned before. Earlier Rock and Roll acts were called \u201cRace music. African-American music - Wikipedia  One of the legacies of racism in America is the desire to down play achievements related to African people. One of the reasons Elvis is coined \u201cThe King of Rock and Roll\u201d is because he was a White man doing the same type of music but its not coming from a people the audience were told to hate and distrust. Also the fact that some Black teens were becoming heartthrobs didn\u2019t sit well with most White parents of that time period.  ",

Elvis Presley, The Beatles, AC/DC, David Bowie, Queen and others were much better and influenced much more with better rock. Even Carlos Santana(Mexican) created Latin Rock, and the rest of the world created their own rock forms. Rock is not one thing that was invented once, it\u00b4s a genre that has been developing and innovating through the years around the world. ",
