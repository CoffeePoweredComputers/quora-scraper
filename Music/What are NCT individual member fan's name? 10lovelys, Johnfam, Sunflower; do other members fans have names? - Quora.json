            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer for WayV. At one point, Cbars and Chinese fans on weibo voted in polls and finally chose WayV members\u2019 individual fandom names. The fandom names are provided and explained below in order of members\u2019 ages. Kun - NuoYi (\u632a\u79fb)  NuoYi (\u632a\u79fb) references \u201c\u4e7e\u5764\u5927\u632a\u79fb\u201d (qiankun da nuoyi - a Chinese phrase which means something like \u201cgreat shift\u201d) which is also a pun on Kun\u2019s Chinese name (\u94b1\u951f - Qian Kun). Kun made the pun a couple of times as well. Ten - 10vely  \u201c10vely\u201d is a reference to his name Ten(10) and \u201clovely\u201d because Ten is lovely. I believe this name was created before the polls as fans used it before Ten debuted in WayV. Win Win - Yunqi (\u8fd0\u6c14/\u6600\u59bb)  Yunqi (\u8fd0\u6c14) means luck. A homonym that is also used sometimes is \u6600\u59bb which means Win Win's wife, because Win Win is \u201c\u6600\u6600\u201d in Chinese. (Note that Win Win is his stage name and his Chinese birthname is Dong Si Cheng (\u8463\u601d\u6210)). Lucas - Lumi  Lumi is based on Lucas\u2019 name which means \u201cshining/bright/luminous\u201d. It is also inspired by Lucas\u2019 Nylon cover.  Hendery - Hengni  Hengni is based on his name (Huang Guanheng \u9ec3\u51a0\u4ea8). It\u2019s a transliteration of \u201choney\u201d, so Hendery and his fans are honey to each other. Xiaojun - Kuanggong (\u77ff\u5de5)  Kuanggong (\u77ff\u5de5) are miners because Xiaojun is iron and so his fans are the miners who unearthed the treasure. (I found this online but I\u2019m not clear why Xiaojun is considered iron). Yang Yang - Yangqi (\u6c27\u6c14)  Yangqi (\u6c27\u6c14) means oxygen. It is a pun on Yang Yang\u2019s name (\u5218\u626c\u626c). Yang Yang and his fans are oxygen for each other. ",
