            "answer_text": "Try the Pencil Exercise! Take a pencil and place the tip (just a little of it) of the eraser just under your top lip. Hold it there for 5 minutes. If your doing it right you'll feel the corners of your mouth get hot and tight within a minute or so. If you can't hold it for 5, don't force it. I gave this trick to my buddy who was last chair trumpet in the Wind Ensemble a few weeks before auditions and he took the principal seat. The pencil trick is like lifting weights for your chops, so when you pick your trumpet up after your pencil work out, you'll have greater strength for the high notes! This works real well. I can play higher then 99% of the trumpet players I meet. #2 - No pressure. This is one for the long run, but you won't be able to change this real quickly without sacrificing range. The more muscles you build the less pressure you'll need to use. (For some of the real high notes a little pressure is necessary). Practice moving the trumpet away from your face as you play. Pressing the mouthpiece against your lips will let you play higher, but at the expense of endurance, because your not using your muscles to play higher, your using the pressure. The less you press the longer you can play high and the nicer your being to your body. #3 - Short Tones and Long Tones. The old idea is that long tones are a great way to warm up. After a lot of new scientific research, people have found that Long tones work your muscles really hard and that warming up with them doesn't make sense. It's like trying to run a 5 mile marathon before a 3 mile race. What would you want to do instead of run 5 miles? You'd want to stretch! Stretching equals short tones. Here's what you do: Start at G (second line), focus your chops and play a short note (not real short, maybe like a quarter note at 120bpm) then after the tone happens (or doesn't happen) while keeping your emboucher focused, take the instrument off of your face, then relax your face and lightly rub the corners of your mouth then relax for 5 seconds. Next do the same thing, but go up chromatically to G# , then down to F# continue to balance going up a note with going down a note. If your chops don't focus properly for the note you want, try again, but only after you take the instrument off of your mouth and release your emboucher. if you haven't got the note in three tries, put the instrument down for a few seconds and start back a little. There's your warm up! This is great because it forces you to focus your chops properly for each note chromatically, so when you need to play it, your chops are perfect! Unlike with long tones you've got a while to focus. Do your short tones with a tuner. The long tones will really strengthen your chops....Do you long tones in the middle of your practice, but balance high and low just like you did with the short tones. When you practice long tones, practice with a tuner. Also add something so you don't get bored like practicing a crescendo or Fp on each note. #4 - Air - Without air, you've got no sound. If you're not using your air properly you wont be able to play well, high or low... ",

            "answer_text": "With any brass instrument you need to practice a lot of lip slurs. Slur from a low C to a G cleanly and slowly, no tongue or valves. When you can do it no problem, add a third space C. And so on up the overtone series. Charles Collins\u2019 book Advanced Lip Flexibility Studies is full of good slurring exercises. Pull out your Arban\u2019s book. Take the passages up a partial, then another. Maynard Ferguson used to take them up an octave to develop his melodic abilities in the upper register. Use the gear you have. Shallow mouthpieces and small bore trumpets can help reinforce the range you have, but no mouthpiece will magically add an octave to your range. Play with the best tone you can across your full range. And lastly: Under no circumstances should you neglect the rest of your playing in pursuit of high notes. Jon Faddis and Arturo Sandoval have effectively unlimited range, but both back that range up with technique and low-register control at equally astonishing levels. Sandoval plays pedal tones with a better sound than the average trombonist. If you intend to play piccolo trumpet having the fundamentals down will help you sound beautiful instead of shrill. ",
