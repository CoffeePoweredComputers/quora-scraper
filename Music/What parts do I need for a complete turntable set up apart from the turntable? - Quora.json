Here\u2019s http://www.rega.co.uk/rb220.html  And a cartridge. Entry level tables often seem to come with an Ortofon Red  Some turntables will also include: A phono stage. If you want to \u201cmove up\u201d in the hobby, I would not buy a turntable with a built in pre-amp unless you can bypass it.A analog to digital converter so that you send the music digitally to your system. I would avoid these turntables unless your only intent is to copy your vinyl collection to digital. Why go through the trouble of vinyl only to have it immediately converted to digital and back to analog?You need a few more things: Assuming you took my advice above, you need a phono stage. Music is not stored on records at its natural \u201ccurve.\u201d Bass and treble are curved down so that more information can fit in the grooves. The phono stage curves those frequencies back up to flat. It also amplifies the sound generated by a tiny stylus vibrating in a tiny groove. You need a phono stage that is compatible with you cartridge\u2019s impedance and amplification requirements (low output cartridges, typically MC, or higher output, typically MM). Entry level tables will usually include a moving magnet (MM) cartridge. MM cartridges are easier to pair with a phono stage than moving coil (MC) cartridges, which typically require more gain and can have more demanding impedance requirements. You can always double-check with the dealer, but most entry level turntables include entry level cartridges that work well with entry level phono stages. Here\u2019s Audio Products Designed and Built in California the Schiiit Mani. An amplifier of some kind.If you\u2019re going to use speakers, an integrated amplifier or pre-amp + amplifier are fine. And some integrated/pre\u2019s have a built-in phono stage. Because you can always bypass their built-in phono stage, I wouldn\u2019t discourage you from buying an integrated/pre with a built-in phono stage.If you\u2019re going to use headphones, you would need a headphone amplifier. (It\u2019s less common for these to include a phono stage.Speakers or headphonesCables. Do not invest in high end cables. You just need well-shielded cables with reasonable resistance characteristics and firmly attached connectors. I\u2019ve heard good things about Blue Jeans cables.",

            "answer_text": "Most turntables include a pickup arm in their design, but if your doesn\u2019t, then you need one. You will also need a pickup cartridge, the thing that holds the needle. There are various useful accessories like an alignment protractor and a tracking weight balance, and various record cleaning devices that you really ought to have and use. You will also need a very solid surface to place the turntable on - a flimsy book case or table won\u2019t do since bass from the speakers will make it resonate and screw up the sound or even make the needle skip. You also need to set up the cartridge correctly, not a trivial matter. Then you need a \u201cPhono Preamplifier\u201d if your amplifier doesn\u2019t have one, an amplifier (and preamplifier if you have separates), and a pair of loudspeakers. And some records. The total cost will range from a few hundred dollars to as much as you can imagine. At the high end a couple of million should do it\u2026 ",
