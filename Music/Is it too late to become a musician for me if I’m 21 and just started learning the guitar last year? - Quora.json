            "answer_text": "No, it is absolutely NOT too late for you to become a respectable guitarist. Let me explain with a few points-some personal and some not. 1. I taught myself to play flamenco and folk guitar when I was 11. By the time I was 13, I had attained a certain level of proficiency which (at the tender age of 13) made me feel like it would be possible to continue, but not without some type of formal instruction. My father promised me that he would try to enroll me into classes with Sophocles Pappas in DC (at that time). For a number of reasons, this did not occur. But it did not stop me. I spent the years from age 11 (grade school) through high school (grade 12). I also felt like I had made no progress. My brother and I used to play and sing at a place called \u201cThrough the Gate\u201d cofee house on Capitol Hill in DC. The repertoire consisted on the same songs, played the same way, for 3 years until my brother died in an accident. Still, no advancement and no progress. I went through the motions of playing after my brother died. I covered everything I had played up to that point. I worked on fingerstyle, I worked on flamenco with golpe, I worked on everything that I knew. At that point, I realized that what I needed to know in order to succeed was not something I could watch other people doing. I had to learn how to do what they did (whatever it was!) through formal instruction. When I was your age, I had already sold all of my guitars and had spent my first year in the Army. I had never stopped my love affair with the guitar, but money for lessons continued to be a HUGE problem. It scarred my soul to sell my guitars. Fast forward a couple of years. I played percussions in a band, wind instruments like sax and flute with the Montgomery County Chamber Music Society, and even played one of Orsino's musicians (flutist, stage name Marie-Therese Lintz) with the Shakespeare Theater's 1989\u20131990 season production of The Twelfth Night in Washington, DC. It all left me cold. I had been playing guitar since I was a kid, and THAT'S what I wanted to do. Just that. Nothing else. In summary, you are ABSOLUTELY NOT TOO YOUNG to learn to play the guitar. But you must understand that playing the guiitar, as with any other instrument, takes many, many hours of work. It does not matter what style you want to play. It ALL takes a tremendous amount of work. If you are serious about the instrument, do not be surprised that you may lose friends who do not understand how much mastering the instrument\u2014and how much it will take to do so. It doesn't really matter what style you want to play. I want to master Bach, Albeniz, Rodrigo and other Spanich composers. You may want to play head over heels better than Malmsteeen or Vai. In any case, or for any genre, you need to understand that you have hit plateaus, and you need to KEEP ON KEEPIN'\u2019 ON, even though you may think that you are getting nowhere. JUST KEEP DOING IT. Lastly, add a few bucks to your monthly budget and find yourself a good TEACHER. A good teacher does not equal a good guitarist. A musician who loves to teach is a good teacher. That is the most important thing you can spend your money on. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because someone is a great player, that makes him/her a great teacher. Nothing could be further than the truth. This is a serious search you have to make. Find someone who loves to teach. My own PHENOMENAL teacher is a guy who studied (and made high honors in) classicial guitar. His love of guitar? METAL. Good luck to you. Don't give up. It's too soon for you to do that. Look for a teacher\u2014preferably one who has studied guitar performamce at a University\u2014who loves to teach. You will not be sorry! ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. You\u2019re never to old to start ANYTHING. I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019m just now starting to do things I wish I would have started when I was 21. Do I wish I had that extra 9 years of experience? Of course. But what if I say, \u201cI\u2019m 30, that\u2019s too old to start!\u201d and then I turn 40, still have the desire to do it and start then? That\u2019s another 10 years of experience I could have had, that I wasted wondering if I was too old to do it. That\u2019s how people end up on their deathbeds wondering what could have been if they would have just went for it. \u201cI just care if I can be able to make my own music. Genre I love to most is electronic rock, this is the kind of music I would love to make.\u201d You need nothing else. Were you born with a guitar in your hand? No? Me neither. Neither was anybody else. The reason we have good musicians is because, just like you, they just wanted to make music, so they decided to. Forget all of the ideas of \u201cthey had talent!\u201d \u201cThey have a gift for it!\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a natural!\u201d Those are all excuses people make for not doing something they want to do. \u201cI can\u2019t do what they do because I don\u2019t have the gift like them.\u201d Well then you can continue buying albums instead of making them, and being a consumer instead of a creator. The reason we have great guitar players like Hendrix in our history isn\u2019t do to \u201ctalent\u201d and \u201cgifts,\u201d as blasphemous as that is to say in the guitar community. It\u2019s do to them bringing a unique perspective to the instrument and the music. They still had to put in hours of practice. They still messed up during live shows and recordings. They still had to wake up every day and decide, \u201cI\u2019m going to play guitar today.\u201d Do you know who else has a unique perspective? You. You\u2019ll have your own style, your own way of looking at the guitar, and your own sense of what sounds good that will become a common emphasis and trademark of your music. All you\u2019re lacking right now is the confidence to fully dive in. But you have the desire, and that is all you need. You get the confidence by continuing to learn, because the more you see you\u2019re capable, the more excited you\u2019ll be to keep going. You gain momentum by doing. It\u2019s not about when you start, it\u2019s about how willing you are to learn. It\u2019s about how committed you are to get the result you want. Read: What happens when you decide to change yourself? Just to be clear, I\u2019m left handed, I play on a right handed guitar. So I play upside down (the big string is on the bottom). When I first started there were two kinds of people: Those that were impressed and continuously reminded me about Jimi Hendrix\u2019s playing style.Those who actually got mad at me, and told me I\u2019d never get anywhere playing that way because you can\u2019t play a guitar upside-down!13 years later, here I am, more in love with making music than ever. In 2007 I got invited to join a metal band, which I played in for 2 years. I got invited to play guitar and bass in a church band. And in 2010 I switched to acoustic guitar which I\u2019ve been doing ever since. I\u2019ve written numerous songs, have an EP on iTunes, and have played live shows in coffee shops here and there. My point is, I might not have been \u201ctoo old\u201d to start, but the way I started was still unconventional. It \u201cwasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d It did because nobody could take away the love I had, the fun I had, when I make music. As long as there is a desire to make music, and a feeling of love and accomplishment when you make it, there\u2019s nothing that can stop you. I went 2 years without a guitar. What did I do? Used my laptop to make music on my computer. Why? Because a lack of proper equipment didn\u2019t cancel out my love for music. If I didn\u2019t have a laptop, I\u2019d probably tie rubber bands to a stick and learn how to make that sound good. I WANT to make music, and because of that, I\u2019m going to, no matter what I need to do. \u201cAll you need is love. Love is all you need.\u201d I love my guitar. I love my music. That\u2019s all I need to continue playing my guitar and making music. :) If you love it, do it. Age is irrelevant.  (The rest of this is just me having a rant. Lol) The most common reason people give up on things they want to do, is because they don\u2019t see results as quickly as they expected, or because they aren\u2019t willing to put in the work required to get the results they\u2019re after. 4 years ago I decided I wanted to create videogames. Guess how many I\u2019ve made to this day? Zero. Why? Because even though I\u2019ve watched COUNTLESS hours of Youtube tutorials in that 4 years, and have spent HUNDREDS of dollars on things to create videogames, every time I opened one of those programs, I realized it was a lot more work than I expected. More work than I wanted to put in to get the result. I just wanted the result. Everybody wants a button they can press to magically get the results they want. Whether with exercising, getting rich, getting good at something, getting popular, you name it. Some people call it \u201cThe magic bullet.\u201d It doesn\u2019t exist. You get good by doing, and doing again, and doing again. And while you\u2019re doing you\u2019re intentionally analyzing how to get better. I\u2019ve been playing guitar for 13 years and I STILL miss strings and notes. So what do I do? I quickly analyze, \u201cWhy does my finger keep going to the wrong string?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s something as small as \u201cOh, my fingernail is slightly too long and it\u2019s throwing off my coordination somehow.\u201d So I go cut my fingernails. Other times I realize that I picked up a bad muscle memory habit, so I keep playing the thing over and CONSCIOUSLY making sure I hit the right string. I\u2019m reprogramming my brain to cooperate correctly with my fingers. Practice isn\u2019t just doing the same thing over. It\u2019s doing the same thing over and consciously adapting, adjusting and improving as you go. But you can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t start going. You get better by looking at professionals (or people who have been doing it longer than you have) and learning how they think, how they create certain sounds, and what they see when they look at a guitar. Example: The other day I talked to my friend about guitar scales\u2013something I\u2019ve avoided forever because to me they are just a huge collection of notes I don\u2019t know what to do with. As I was talking to him he casually said, \u201c\u2026I just look at the shapes of the scales and move those around the fret board.\u201d I stopped him immediately. \u201cWait, wait, wait. So when you look at scales you don\u2019t see all the individual notes? You see a shape comprised of all those notes?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I IMMEDIATELY understand scales and was no longer intimidated by them, just by that simple change in perspective. All in all\u2026 It\u2019s not too late. Nothing can stop you from starting anything, even when you\u2019re 80 years old, besides you. Besides the idea that \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d I\u2019m 30 and single. My biggest fear, the thing that keeps me from asking girls out is this:,\u201cIt\u2019s too late! I\u2019m too old! All my other friends are already married and have kids! All I have is a cat!\u201d Now imagine I keep that attitude up for another 10 years, guess what I\u2019ll be? Single when I\u2019m 40. The ONLY solution to that problem is to do what\u2019s necessary to get the result I want. You want to be a musician? Do what\u2019s necessary. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s necessary? First is committing to learn the instrument. Second is to get around (or at least talk to) people who are doing what you want to do, and you will naturally begin to pick things up from them. If you want to learn how to shoot a basketball, you wouldn\u2019t ask a racecar driver. ",
