            "answer_text": "I think it is pretty much impossible to tell what John Lennon thought. A lot has been made of a single comment that Lennon spoke saying that the songs on one of Mitchell\u2019s album were \u201covereducated,\u201d which he followed by saying something like, \u201cyou want to sell a lot of records, don\u2019t you?\u201d Based on that it seems like what he was conveying was that her songs were to sophisticated or complex to be pop. That is a lot different from saying that they were good or bad. I don\u2019t think Joni Mitchell was trying to write pop hits or that John Lennon believed that was what she was trying to do. They were both great creative talents, and my guess is that each of them had enough sense to respect the work of the other for what it was. ",
