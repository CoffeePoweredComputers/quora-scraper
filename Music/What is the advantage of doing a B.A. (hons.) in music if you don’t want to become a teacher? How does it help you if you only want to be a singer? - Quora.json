            "answer_text": "Having a degree is always good , it helps theoretically but that doesn't garuantee you to become a good singer. Just a degree would not make you an artist. It needs more than a certificate I belive. Few things that I observed: 1)The Gharana System of Learning : \u201cGuru -Shishya Parampara\u201d The indigenous system of Learning music was to live under the shelter of a Guru. The leaning was more practical then theoretical. One basically lives the life of the Guru. And disciples tend to imbibe every quality of the guruji. Just to name a few renowned artists to learn in this format. a) Pandit Bhimsen Joshi - Desicple of Sawai Gandharva. b) Ustad Rashid Khan - Desicple of Ustaad Nisaar Hussain Khan and Ustad Gulam Mustafa khan . c) Mohammed Rafi- Desicple of Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan. d) Lata Mangeshkar - Desicple of Pandit Deen anath Mangeshkar ( Her Father.) e) Suresh Wadekar - Desicple of Pandit Jialal Vasant. f) Hariharan - Desicple of Ustad Gulam Mustafa Khan The above is just a few to name there are many more who have followed the same tradition of Learning music. This system of Learning has been heavenly diluted over the years . But the tradition has not completely vanished . Renowned singers like Rashid khan , Hariharan, Suresh Wadekar, Ajoy Chakraborty , Ravi Shankar and many more still teach in the guru shishya parampara. Coming back to the real question: No degree of music from any universe will help you if you don't dedicate time for Riyaz(Practice), Passion for music and dedication towards it. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a singer requires special inherent talent , gift of the voice and of course rigorous training and practice. A degree of BA in Music ,may theoretically help you in a very little way but it's ultimately your talent and hard work that will see you through. There are great singers, present and past , who didn't have a degree. And there are MA degree holders in music, who have not become singers. Hope you get my point. ",
