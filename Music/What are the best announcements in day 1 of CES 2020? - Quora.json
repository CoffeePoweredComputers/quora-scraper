            "answer_text": "I will discuss about the top tech AI that was revealed in consumer electronic show (CES) which was held in US for the year 2020. The first one is Neon which captures CES 2020 buzz with artificial humans, which may help to reinvent the future of work Neon, a startup funded by Samsung's research arm, has developed a artificial humans. These computational artificial humans, built on a platform called Core R3, will are capable to show emotions and intelligence. Neon isn't a next-gen digital assistant, but more like your digital twin with its own personality over time. Neon's artificial humans are more like video chat bots that can learn from experiences and be unique. Neon appears to be able to produce a replica of you and potentially learn from your behavior. The second cool stuff of AI is the ballie which was created by Samsung This is small, rolling robot with on-device AI capabilities The product comes at a time when more companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon aim to put more cameras into household items and trying to build a smart house which is capable of doing lots of stuffs. But this ballie roll robot is awewsome This robot will follow you where ever you go and talk with you and this is also capable to do all the things which you can do with the personal assistant. The third stuff of AI which was revealed in CES is Qualcomm Automotive autonomous driving platform The chipmaker company also introduced a new car to cloud services platform, as well as a new reference platform to advance Cellular Vehicle to Everything technology. Qualcomm announced Snapdragon Ride, a new autonomous driving platform designed to scale across all levels of autonomy, from Level 1 and Level 2 vehicles that offer driver assistance to completely self-driving Level 5 vehicles. The Snapdragon Ride takes a great approach to building autonomous services, combining hardware, software, open stacks, development kits, tools, and a partner ecosystem. Automakers can use the platform with their own algorithms or with the Snapdragon Ride Autonomous Stack. The purpose built autonomous driving software stack offers optimized software and applications for complex use cases, such as self-navigating highway driving, as well as a choice of modular options like Perception, Localization, Sensor Fusion, and Behavior Planning. The software infrastructure can also co-host customer-specific stack components with Snapdragon Ride Autonomous Stack components. Qualcomm also introduced the new Car to Cloud Service, that is connected car services that enable automakers to keep vehicles up to date with over the air (OTA) updates. It's designed for Qualcomm's Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms and Snapdragon Automotive 4G and 5G Platforms this service will keep cockpit and telematics systems up to date. The fouth technology is an AI-powered litter box iKuddle. The company, which develops pet-centric AI Internet of Things smart devices, is following up the litter box by announcing the launch of its AI-powered iKuddle Water Fountain and iKuddle Auto Feeder and is unveiling the first health and diet-monitoring AI Internet of Things ecosystem for pets. The idea is that with few reliable options that offer a huge solution for monitoring your pet's health on a day to day basis, iKuddle's ecosystem can offer a self reliant system that intelligently monitors a cat's health and adjusts its food or water intake accordingly. The AI Internet of Things ecosystem also alerts owners to any drastic health changes that may need the attention of a veterinarian. The last best technology which was revealed in CES 2020 by Delta is pilot parallel reality display at various airport Delta Airlines is investing in parallel reality displays a new kind of personalized signage that only shows you information that is relevant to you. Developed by the startup Misapplied Sciences which was backed by delta, the first parallel reality display will go live in Airport in mid-2020. Delta is finally going to come with a technology which will display whatever things are realted to you on airport this is fully based on AI. So this are the best technologies which was revealed in the ces 2020 which was fully based on ai i hope you can see all this technology soon in the mid of 2020 and don\u2019t forget to comment which ai technology will boom in the market you can check out codewrestling on youtube for updates on technology ",

Theres nothing to feel bad in asking this as its in their best interests, unless the middle portion is full, the upstairs wont be ready for them to market whatever they want to market, irrespective of what this arrogant buyers mood is and if he is not most likely to buy, but still its in their best interests to increase their conversion rate ;) ",
