            "answer_text": "Most answers here have immediately said no. I will venture to say, \u201cYes, on a conscious or subconscious level, quite possibly.\u201dYes, maybe.. and here\u2019s why. Let me pose the following question back to you and let\u2019s assume you were a German male.   Would it be racist for you to like Nazi Hitler youth music? Most Germans want nothing to do with the Nazis and are ashamed of that history. What did both the Nazis and Dixie stand for? White Supremacy. At the end of the day, I find no pleasure in listening to Dixie or Nazi music because it stood for hate, racial domination, and the enslavement of weaker people. You might rationalize it as you, \u201cjust like a tune,\u201d but what does the tune stand for, who\u2019s its author, and what did their authors believe in?   Moreover, don\u2019t many self avowed racists listen to such music at their rallies and create new reproductions of such music to propagate their white supremacist views? I would also ask, what draws you to the music or tunes of racists?  For me, there\u2019s nothing to like about the music of either group, but this is America. You sound like a decent person and none of the aforementioned is a personal indictment. You\u2019re you\u2019re free to enjoy all the segregationist and or Nazi music you like.  ",

            "answer_text": "For now, the answer could go either way. But the more attention that is drawn to the slavery connotations in it, that song could easily turn into a symbolic reference to it. The more attention that is given, the more likely it is to become something else. Like a rainbow. Or Kate Smith. Like making the OK symbol with your hand; more recently. That started out as satire, and as a satirical dare, and social media and news ran with it Now it actually became our newest racist symbology. I asked a few people what that song meant in their opinion, and they all just thought it was just an affectionate song about the south. That could change. Is it racist if you don\u2019t realize it was a confederate marching tune? No. but the more that people point it out, the riskier it is to use it. These days, I feel that social pressure can quickly ostracize someone/thing: you could get arrested fired or thrown onto the news for expressing opinions; because they are unpopular. Unpopular shouldn\u2019t mean unconstitutional. Even Nazis or the KKK have rights; provided they don\u2019t incite violence. My friends I polled didn\u2019t realize it was an official confederate marching tune. So for now, I say \u201cno\u201d. But that may not last forever. With enough social media influence and dedication, you could make \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d a song about ageism. And with enough controversy, it will be so. Dangerous times. ",
