            "answer_text": "While the GoPRO is not mainly designed for regular photography, you can use it for this. Just keep in mind the wide angle is great for wide landscapes and tight interiors, but not so great for close-ups or mid-length shots. I tried taking good shots of details, like a wall with some cool graffiti, and the results were a lot more mixed (though often still usable). The overall image quality seems really good to my eyes. Photos from previous models had a faded look to them, and the older cameras struggled especially with glare. Now the still image quality is fantastic and feels at least on par with what you can get from your average smartphone. While a GoPRO is just decent for general photography, I think it\u2019s actually better than other still cameras for taking selfies. That\u2019s because it\u2019s super easy to capture not just yourself, but your surroundings as well. This is ideal for travel selfies as you\u2019ll often want to capture as much of the location as possible, so you can really show off where you are (and not just your beautiful face). ",

            "answer_text": "GoPros are great creations. But it has its own position in photography. It can not replace pro or semi-pro cameras. The SLRs and mirrorlesses have better sensors and glasses. lenses are very important, this is by far the weakest point of GoPros. in defence of GoPro, one could say, the sheer size of action cameras, it's easy to carry, doesn't scare people off, not a distraction, lightweight. Which is important for action and street photography. I don't see GoPros replacing the DSLRs any sooner. By this time they\u2019ll be the essentialities for vloggers and video content creators. Now, personally, I think, travel photos should be taken with proper cameras in full resolution and using the best possible lense, because that particular moment may not ever come back and you may never visit the place again. I think you may follow the works of some travel and street photographers to understand the effect of a true camera. ",
