            "answer_text": "Many of his songs are Freestyles that have also become a Hit. He basically knows what he is going to address in his bars and he grabs the mic and spits it out. Just check out most of his freestyles on BET Cypher, Slaughterhouse, Tim Westwood TV. His verse in Detroit vs Everybody was also a freestyle. The Legend can spit bars all day long and 100 different styles. Rap God isn\u2019t a huge thing if you have heard his verse on Tech N9ne\u2019s Speedom (freestyle), The Ringer (amazing freestyle), Nicki Minaj\u2019s Majesty (Fastest Freestyle in his career) and much more. He only writes a lot more than he actually raps and that\u2019s what let him make such songs that people when they hear it, feel it might not be freestyle. Well, That\u2019s Eminem anyways, he is the Rap God for a reason. Invincible bars and Immortal Flows. ",
