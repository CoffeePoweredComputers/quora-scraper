            "answer_text": "Man, there are so many out there. Antares has been the go-to for a long time, but many viable alternatives are available today. Celemony\u2019s Melodyne, Waves\u2019 Tune, (heck tbh I sometimes use Flex Pitch in Logic X). Technology has come a long way. So pretty much anything you use will get the job done. Of course some tools are better than others, but that being said, if you know how to use the available tools within most auto tune software you\u2019ll be able to get the sound you want. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Antares coined the actual term Autotune, but there are a bunch of different tuning programs out there. Melodyne, Waves tune, one by iZotope are the biggest ones besides Antares. Most professionals don\u2019t actually use the automatic mode though, they will go in and manually tune/time correct the vocal per word ",
