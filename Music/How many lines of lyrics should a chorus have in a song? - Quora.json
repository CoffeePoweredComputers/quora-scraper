            "answer_text": "I prefer to think of it in bars of music. (In most songs, a bar is 4 beats.) A good guideline would be 8 or 16 bars. A lot of times, one beat could have two syllables. Take a line from Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLove Story\u201d: \u201cRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\u201d If I were to break it up into beats based on the way the lyrics fit into the rhythm, it would be \u201cRomey-o-take-me-somewhere-wecan-beya-lone\u201d If you count that up, it\u2019s 8 beats total, making it 2 bars. The whole chorus of the song is 8 bars. You can even get fancy and add syncopation, where the beginning of a bear falls in the middle of a syllable. You can hear this in the chorus of \u201cHot \u2018n\u2019 Cold\u201d by Katy Perry, where the first word of every line is syncopated (hot, yes, in, up, wrong, black, fight, and kiss). To sum it up, think about how your words fit into a rhythm, and try to write 8 or 16 bars worth of lyrics. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not necessarily about the amount of lyrics or how many words but more so about the length of \u201cbars\u201d. The standard hook is usually 8 bars long. A bar is a measure of time in beats in relation to the music. You can fit as much lyrics as you want within the time frame of 8 bars however, you want to create something that people can remember, understand , and that is easy for fans to repeat. I hope this helps! ",
