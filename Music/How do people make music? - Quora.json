            "answer_text": "Anthropologists tell us there\u2019s evidence that human-kind has been making music for tens of thousands of years. When we make music, we\u2019ve always done it using whatever materials are available to us at the time and strongly influenced by our surroundings and opportunities. One of the fascinating mysteries about music is that we don\u2019t fully understand what it is that defines the absolute essence of what music is or why we do it. But even under the most confining circumstances, the music somehow still comes out. In this next video, you\u2019ll see a Botswanian man playing a $5.00 guitar with two strings missing. His song and technical approach has no correlation to any of the Western ideas of what a guitar is or how it should be used. Yet, whatever it is, he\u2019s instinctively found that thing that is the essence of what we call music. Between this and other postings of the same video, Ronnie has garnered as many YouTube views as the most highly acclaimed music stars of our day, without the benefit of any marketing or promotional program.  Here\u2019s another. This fellow has made a guitar-like instrument out of trash. It wouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch to imagine that what we\u2019re seeing here is the genetic roots of American Blues, Southern Black Gospel, 60s Soul or even (yes), Jimi Hendrix. Jimi had better equipment and lived at a time where he had access to musical influences and a marketing industry. Absent the opportunities and environmental factors, could this be the musical essence of what would later become Jimi Hendrix and the other Black American popular styles?  Considering the two videos we\u2019ve seen so far, are all those fancy synthesizers really necessary? I think an answer of, \u201cno,\u201d should be pretty evident. That is, unless you want to make synthesizer music using synthesizers. In this next video we have Isao Tomita playing one of the most expensive synthesizers ever built. Tomita has a solid education in Classical training and somehow came up with the money for a Moog System 55 along with his own professional level recording studio. I\u2019d like to also point out that the lovely backing choir you hear was also created and pre-recorded using the Moog System 55 and probably a Mellotron.  Somewhere between these two extremes of expense and opportunity, lies your personal answer to your question. Search your influences, your inspiration, your will, drive and ambitions. Find a way to merge them with your opportunities, abilities and finances. If you are willing, there\u2019s a musical niche that reflects who you are and how you reach for your own version of this magical mystery that is the essence of music. ",

            "answer_text": "People make music entirely inside their heads, using the feedback created by their instruments (reminder that \u201cinstrument\u201d is a synonym for \u201ctool\u201d) to help guide their process. The choice of which instrument or tool to use during this creative process is entirely personal and arbitrary. Plenty of people use pure software tools to create music. I myself do this. Others use fancy sequencers, but freely admit that the pure software tools are more powerful (if somewhat less powerful). Take this video for example, which admits that Live is more featureful and compete than the OP-1:  BT (Brian Transeau) uses a variety of software tools and real instruments. Many of these tools he wrote or designed himself. Sometimes he writes songs purely in code, from the sounds up to the orchestration. This song, for instance, he cites as being generated by \u201c100 pages of code\u201d:  Here is some of the code: BT - This Binary Universe Of course, nothing so elaborate is necessary to make music. A singer makes music with only her voice. Others, who prefer software voices, stream sessions of tuning a software singer (e.g. Vocaloid) live on YouTube:  Ultimately, the tools used to create music are entirely a matter of personal preference. While it's tempting to immediately go for the most powerful tool, it's worth noting that that power can lead you astray from the creative process. Limitations are just as important, as Igor Stravinsky notes: The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self. And the arbitrariness of the constraint serves only to obtain precision of execution. ",
