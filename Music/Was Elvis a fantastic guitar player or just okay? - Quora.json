            "answer_text": "Elvis was a terrible guitar player and an equally awful pianist. He used the guitar (Martin D-18) mostly as a prop. He knew some basic chords, but other than that, he was pathetic. Having a guitar slung around you (especially a Dreadnought acoustic) is a great way to hide a \u201cbeer belly\u201d and/or strike some great poses. Elvis used the guitar to do both. Genius! ",
