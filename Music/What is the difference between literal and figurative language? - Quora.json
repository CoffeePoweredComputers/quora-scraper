            "answer_text": "Literal language is meant to be taken (that is, understood) exactly as said. \u201cBob and Roger are playing poker in the kitchen\u201d is literal language. It refers to two literal people (Bob and Roger) in a literal location (the kitchen) doing a literal thing (playing a particular type of card game). Figurative language is meant to exress some other concept by using metaphorical wording. \u201cBob is eating Roger\u2019s lunch!\u201d is figurative language (assuming that Bob is not actually eating from Roger\u2019s plate). Instead, it means the Bob is winning against Roger in their poker game, by quite a margin. To determine the difference, one uses context and common sense. \u201cThe autumn wind took the leaves from the neighbor\u2019s tree and dumped them all over my yard\u201d makes sense in literal terms (other than possibly picturing the wind as a thinking force), and there seems no reason to try to interpret this as anything other than literal. \u201cThe autumn wind took me away to Thanksgivings of years past\u201d is figurative. It makes little sense to suppose that wind could cause time-travel. But the feel of, and the sounds and smells carried by, the wind in autumn can induce a person\u2019s memory centers to reflect on past events. So there is no reason to interpret this as anything other than a figurative way of saying that breezy autumn afternoons make me feel nostalgic. ",
