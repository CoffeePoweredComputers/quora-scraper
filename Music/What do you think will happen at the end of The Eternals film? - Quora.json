The climax will start with the team coming together. They will have had many obstacles towards working together efficiently along the way, but will finally come together for the greater good.  They will then have to fight the big bad guy and his disposable army in order to obtain a McGuffin. The fight will seem to be going great as the poorly written score that makes up their theme song plays in the background.  But then the villain will step in. Each member of the team will try to defeat him alone, but they will fail.  Only while working as a team will they be able to succeed.  They will then obtain the McGuffin and reaffirm their status as a team for the inevitable sequel.  Basically, it will consist of the normal trite shit that goes into a climax of a Marvel Movie. ",

And if I have to sit through a montage of how the Celestials (big C) mucked about with sentient life all over the universe, leaving mainline beings, Deviants, and Eternals, and how on Earth there was a civil war among the Eternals so some left for Titan, moon of Saturn, and Thanos was one, but inherited a recessive Deviant gene while his bro got the date-rape gene, but on Earth, how weird, their names and powers were so similar to the Olympian Gods they acted as their Earthly Avatars until that went tits up, and Sersi joined the Avengers and fell in love with Jon Snow, even though he\u2019s short, I\u2019ll shove a straw in my eye.

I think it will end with Kro and the Deviants in an end credits scene, and then it will end. I\u2019m not sure if it will explore the celestials or not, since I\u2019m not the biggest expert on the Eternals, but expect Origins, and definitely an appearance from the Deviants, who are the Eternals\u2019 biggest enemies. This will probably be a trilogy so I expect the Deviants to come in the second film. Sorry this answer wasn\u2019t that helpful, but hopefully it\u2019s better than nothing. ",

The movie will perhaps start at an archeological survey just like the comics.  The movie will also focus on Ikarris or other Eternals trying to bring the celestials back to Earth.  In the comics Ikarris uses a Cosmic Beacon left behind by the Celestials. In the end, or perhaps the post credit scene, maybe we could see Celestials coming to the Earth.  In the comic, we got the Origin Story in Eternals #001 but we got to see a Celestial at the end of Eternals #002. ",
