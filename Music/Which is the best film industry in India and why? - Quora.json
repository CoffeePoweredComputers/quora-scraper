            "answer_text": "Malayalam film industry ( Mollywood ) hands down. I have seen fair share of regional movies (originals with subtitles, not hindi dubbed )  Some might argue that Malayalam films are slow and draggy, but there's a reason why they do it. Most Kollywood and Bollywood filmmakers produce choppy and hurried screenplays in the name of making it 'fast-paced', but the end result is an inconsistent, half-baked narrative that's lost in translation, leaving the audience unsatisfied and dumbfounded. Malayalam films treat their movies like fine wine; the more it ages, the more rich the brew is. While on one hand they demand your time and patience, on the other hand they force you to sub-consciously invest yourself in the characters and the plot. By the end of the film, you feel like you'd been transported to another realm with all of the characters becoming a part of your own life. Filmmaking is one of the purest forms of creative synergy. Without a strong and complete crew, a potentially good movie can fall flat on its face. Unfortunately, the stars of most of our films believe that a film is all about themselves, and there is no room to collaborate with their peers if the story demands it. Hero worship has sadly become a norm in our country. Think about it: how many Tamil, Telugu or Hindi mainstream multi-starrer films can you think of? But darkness, as they say, cannot exist without light. 'Mollywood' stars never shy away from sharing screen space with other famous actors provided the plot demands it. Look at a film like Premam or Charlie. They're a testament to the fact that you don't have to get out of the country to create beautiful frames. Our landscapes, our cities, our villages, our streets and our culture offer limitless forms of inspiration. Of course, there is no harm in setting your story abroad, but a film about a tough cop falling in love with a girl in Chennai has no reason to suddenly transport them to a snow-covered hillock in Switzerland and taking away most of the hitherto-demure heroine's clothes. Spending crores for the sake of a song that shouldn't have been made in the first place wouldn't exactly translate into good cinema. Anurag Kashyap said in one of his interviews that having a low budget allows him to experiment more. It is only a financial limitation that checks the scale and grandeur. In terms of imagination, a low budget is a boon; a tool that allows you to tread new grounds instead of the taking the familiar, template route that most commercial films are limited to. And Malayalam cinema is a living, fire-breathing example of this school of thought. if you've noticed, every Malayalam movie has a nostalgic undertone with varying levels of subtlety. Take Premam for instance. It didn't have a plot or anything significant to say, but it worked on so many levels, with one of them being the nostalgic factor. Just the mere thought of Shambu and Koya singing 'Kanmani Anbodu Kadhalan' or 'Mava' singing 'Ennavale adi ennavale...' brings a smile to our faces, doesn't it? the concept of 'hero-worship' seeps into most of our commercial films, portraying the protagonist as an invincible being who can take on at least 50 people at a time, even if he was shown following the neighbourhood hottie on a cycle a few minutes ago. And this has been happening since the beginning of time and still hasn't changed. Now that's something you would never see in a Malayalam film. Their characters behave like what they're supposed to be: human. The Malayalam industry is one of the very few regional film fraternities that gives the respect screenwriters really deserve, which is why if not for anything else, a Malayalam film will definitely have a very strong plot and multi-dimensional characters. Things have definitely started to change slowly, and hopefully in the next decade we'll see our very own writers' names up on the marquee instead of being buried somewhere in the end credits. image source : Pinterest ",
