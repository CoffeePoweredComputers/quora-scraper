            "answer_text": "Tons of video editors are out there in the market. But we have weed through the top 3 for your reference. GoPro appThis GoPro app is available on both your iPhone and Android phones This app can quickly analyses your videos to detect colours and faces in order to frame your footage perfectly. What is even better is this app also lets users add transitions and effects onto a maximum of 200 photos and video clips. 2. Abobe Premiere Clip This app has plenty of neat features. For example, it creates a video very quick, either with an automatic editing function or more advanced customized editing features allowing you to do everything from trimming clips to adjusting volume. 3. WeVideo This app is quite user-oriented by offering a clean interface. You don't need too much expert knowledge to use it. WeVideo has put full control in your hands, like text, transmissions, etc. I also want to recommend a very good tool called DVDFab Video Converter which is used on a computer in case you also have a need to convert and edit videos on your PC instead of your phone.

            "answer_text": "If you are any way serious about doing Video Editing then do not start from a \u201cquick and easy\u201d \u201cStick a couple of bits together in a template\u201d sort of editor. Even for these there is some learning involved if you want to do anything good. Start with a video editor which will grow with you \u2013 so you can keep adding more value to the Fan Site. That \u201cquick and easy\u201d will very soon become boring. I would suggest using HitFilm Express Download HitFilm Express | for Mac & PC - fxhome.com Apart from the fact that it is Free, it is very comprehensive and, behind the initial easy \u201csticking bits together\u201d, is a very powerful editor with lots of fun video effects for you to incorporate into those Fan Videos. FXHome have a huge number of How To out there on YouTube and there is a very helpful Forum of users (Well, there are now more the 4 Million of us!) ",
