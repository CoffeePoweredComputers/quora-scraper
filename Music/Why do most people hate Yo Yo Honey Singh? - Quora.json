            "answer_text": "So why do people hate honey Singh ? Who said people hate honey singh,I mean, people can love Eminem with his lyrics in \u201cAss like that\" but cannot digest honey Singh saying, \u201c I swear choti dress mein bomb lagdi mainu\" and then comes a song a few song but not as bad Eminem's. People can hear nicky Minaj saying shit lyrics but we can not hear honey Singh and that's the way we show loyalty to women. Guys do you just find honey Singh to deserve hatred or have you just decided to hate honey Singh. I have been watching that few people say honey Singh provokes sexism in his songs and come up with songs which are years old like get up jawani. Now don't you guys hear love dose, where he praises the beauty of a woman and songs like brown rang evaluating brown skin girls. No, because we have show the bad qualities of the singers from our own country and we will always love foreign movies,foreign culture,foreign styles and other things right? Because we are a bunch of crap. The guys who just say honey Singh having crappy lyrics in his song,I want to ask you,have you ever heard Bhagat Singh by yo yo. It has good lyrics but it came to be a major flop of his life and for which he didn't get work for three years. Replace yourself with that person and now think of a person whose father has a government job,mother is a house wife and he is fighting with his family just put up with his career in music industry. Just feel how lower he had to degrade himself at that time and then came dope shope with such lyrics and became a major hit. Who made it a hit? You guys, am I right? Now what would a person do if he has to continue his career ,will he just make good lyrics to get flop or come up with such songs and become hit? I would have chosen what honey Singh did ? Now you guys will say about that abusing song which he made with Badshah, I just can't recognize whose voice was that because it was not honey Singh and if it was him then why don't you guys criticise Badshah too. Because we have to degrade the one who is on the top. I personally dont love him but I don't hate him either. He is making good musics like dil chori and chottey chottey peg maar and I love them. I mean that guy can easily make a person move with his songs. Having no godfather in industry,he is self made and ruling the Bollywood. He also raps well,you guys don't like him rapping because he doesn't rap the usual style other singers rap,you just need fast rhyming as much as I understand. Let something new com in your music okay. You like bohemia,Eminem and other american-indian rappers, I mean here also you need mixture right.watch out guys you can't bear a pure Indian singer having such fame. Shame on you. I have been watching YouTube where overseas people were praising honey Singh music but we can not. Now he is back with Makhna and he will rock again. ",

            "answer_text": "I will write down all my grievances against Mr.  Honey Singh.  1. His lyrics. Omg what should I say? Aaj blue hai (paani)x10^infinity or phone, charger rakhle, roti bhindi pack kar among many nonsensical others. I mean it's good to have high aims in life but if he's seriously aiming to win a Grammy one day then he has to improve the quality of his lyrics a lot.  2. His portrayal of women. Like seriously? Kudi namkeen? Choti dress mei bomb lagti mainu? 3. His attitude. This dude has surely got an attitude problem. If he thinks he can insult bigwigs such as Eminem, Enrique Iglesias and Ludacris and get away with it, I'm sorry but I don't see that happening. Besides he needs to distinguish between facts and fantasy for the reality is that he is in no way a better singer than any of these.  All things said, I would like to add that his music is kind of good and if I ignore the lyrics(which requires quite a lot of effort) I like the beats but if he works a bit on them, they could be quite nice actually.
