            "answer_text": "This is not an easy question to answer, as the whole issue of the status of South West Africa/Namibia was rather complex, with on the one hand the UN adopting a stand against South Africa\u2019s presence in the territory and on the other hand the International Court of Justice ruling in favour of South Africa. This dragged on from 1946 until 21 June 1971 when the ICJ finally ruled against the legality of South Africa\u2019s occupation. But a lot had happened in between that fully committed South Africa by the time of the 1971 ruling. The South West African People\u2019s Organisation (SWAPO) was formed in 1960, with their armed wing The People\u2019s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) having followed soon. PLAN soldiers were sent to the USSR for military training and a violent overthrow of the South African administration in South West Africa became the intention. South Africa felt they had to protect the people of South West Africa against an armed invasion and the border zone with Angola and Zambia became increasingly militarised. The first clash happened on 26 August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe, which is considered as the start of the war. Two guerrillas were killed, one wounded and eight captured by South African forces. Throughout the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s there were numerous invasions by PLAN guerrillas, which mainly involved planting of landmines and attacks on isolated farms and small communities, and hunting down of these insurgents by South African soldiers. Of course, the whole issue became even more complex with the start of the Angolan Civil War in the 70\u2019s, the involvement of Cuban soldiers therein, South Africa\u2019s support for UNITA,etc, so that it\u2019s really hard to separate these. At the height of the war there were 71 000 soldiers from South Africa (31 000) and the South West African Territory Force and Police (30 000) involved, against 122 000 soldiers from SWAPO (32 000), Cuba (40 000) and Angola (50 000). There was never a major invasion of South West Africa/Namibia, as most of the fighting occurred on the Angolan side of the border. If one has to decide on a winner, it would depend on what the objectives of the opposing sides were. From SWAPO\u2019s standpoint their initial intention was a violent overthrow of the administration. They did not succeed in doing so, but they did win the election eventually. From South Africa\u2019s point of view their initial intention in 1946 was to incorporate the territory, which the UN prevented. Once armed incursions started they were adamant to protect the population against a violent overthrow. They succeeded in doing so. At some point they realised that an independent Namibia was inevitable, so keeping SWAPO out for long enough to create manoeuvring space for the internal parties of South West Africa became the objective. They were fairly successful with that, in that SWAPO failed to gain a two thirds majority (they mustered 57% of the popular vote) and had to sit down with the internal parties to negotiate a final constitution. Going by the political end result, I would then say the war was won 57\u201343 in favour of SWAPO. The South African forces had the last laugh, though. The elections in Namibia were overseen by the United Nations Transition Action Group (UNTAG) under the leadership of UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari. Part of the peace agreement was that the South African forces were to be confined to their bases, and PLAN forces to the north of the 16th parallel in Angola until such time that a UN peacekeeping force had arrived and they could be demobilised. On 31 March 1989 South Africa became aware that PLAN troops were moving south and on 1 April they crossed into Ovamboland. With no UN troops available yet, Ahtisaari had no choice but to lift all restrictions on the South African soldiers, who drove the PLAN soldiers back across the border.
