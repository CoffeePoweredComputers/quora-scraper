            "answer_text": "No, they didn\u2019t . The Beatles first single was released October, 1962 (first record album was released March, 1963) - and their last recording of original music was released May, 1970 - 7\u20131/2 years. But for this comparison I am using the US Billboard chart, so the relevant starting date for the Beatles is February, 1964 when they were first formally introduced to Americans. The Rolling Stones were introduced in the USA soon after the Beatles, in June, 1964. Therefore the active period considered here is March, 1964 to June, 1970 - about 6 years. The Beatles recorded 211 songs for release during their 7\u20131/2 year recording period. This doesn\u2019t count live performances nor does it include the many songs they gave to others, such as \u201cA World Without Love\u201d (Billboard US #1 hit for Peter & Gordon in 1964). (As an aside: The Beatles were prolific, and that certainly helped them rack up the numbers. For comparison with modern standards, Adele\u2019s first album was released in January, 2008 and her third album was released in November, 2015 - almost 8 years later. Adele has released 34 original recordings in the States during her 10-year career State-side, compared with 37 top twenty songs that the Beatles themselves charted in just six years in the States.) The Rolling Stones first single was released in the UK in June, 1963, shortly after the Beatles first album was released in the UK. Of course the Stones are still together 47 years after the Beatles last recording was released (Let it Be) and 48 years after the Beatles split up. There are several album charts, but I\u2019ve just referenced Billboard for the United States and stopped counting after the top 20, so this is not definitive. (The 27 #1 Beatles hits used to select songs for the compilation album \u201c1\u201d combine UK and US charts.). Also, there are a number of Beatles songs that as far as I know did not chart for the Beatles during the 60s, but are big hits because they are well known and have been covered by other artists. \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds\u201d (Billboard #1 for Elton John in 1974) is an example, but there are many others. Here is the comparison: Beatles: 19 #1, 3 #2, 3 #3, 2 #4, 1 #5, 2 #8, 1 #10, 1 #11, 2 #12, 1 #14, 1 #17, 1 #19 = 37 top 20 in the US Billboard charts.The Beatles - Chart history Stones: 5 #1, 1 #2, 1 #3, 2 #6, 1 #8, 2 #9, 1 #14, and 1 #19 = 14 top 20 in the US billboard charts.

            "answer_text": "If you check out The Beatles album \"1,\" as in \"one,\" it's an album of all their number one hits.  There's 27 songs on the album.    I did a quick search and found information that The Rolling Stones had 8 number one songs.  The site is Askville, probably not the most reliable site on earth?  But, it should give you a close idea.  Here's a link: How many number one hit singles has The Rolling Stones had? Here's what Wikipedia had to say about The Beatles \"1\" album: 1 is a compilation album by the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single released in the United Kingdom and United States from 1962 to 1970 by the Beatles. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on one compact disc. 1 was a commercial success, and topped the charts worldwide. 1 has sold over 31 million copies.[1]In addition, 1 is the fourth best-selling album in the US since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking US album sales in January 1991,[2] and the best-selling album of the decade in the US from 2000 to 2009,[3] as well as the best selling album of the decade worldwide. It is also the fastest selling album in history.[4] 1 was remastered and reissued in September 2011.[5] You can link to the article here: 1 (Beatles album) As others have mentioned, The Rolling Stones have some die hard fans and there are many people that prefer them over The Beatles.  In fact, John Lennon was jealous of the fact that The Stones got to be the bad boys of rock, while The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein insisted that they keep a squeaky clean image.  In reality, The Beatles were probably as wild as The Stones - but people didn't know it.  Their image was that of a bunch of lovable mop tops. FYI - A lot of people don't know that George Harrison is the one that recommended that Decca Records sign The Rolling Stones!  Decca lost out on The Beatles.  As I recall,  Dick Rowe was with George Harrison judging some kind of contest.  He asked George who he thinks he should sign.  George said he didn't know.  Rowe said \"Well who do you like.\"  George replied \"I like The Rolling Stones.\"  According to the book, Dick Rowe jumped up and left his judging post and left for London IMMEDIATELY to sign The Rolling Stones.  If I'm not mistaken, this was mentioned in The Bob Spitz book on The Beatles. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The Beatles were very prolific by any standards; together for just eight years and with 11 original (British) studio albums and 17 British number one hits. That\u2019s not counting the songs they gave away to others. Their songs ranged over a wide range of genres and the signal-to-noise ratio was exceptionally high too. The Rolling Stones can\u2019t come close to that. They did experiment with different styles early on but settled for doing one thing that they did really well and worked for them and their fans: the hard-blues-rock that sustains them in concert to this day. It\u2019s sometimes said that you could be a Beatles fan or a Stones fan, but not both. That of course is nonsense; anyway the members of the two bands got on well and the Stones\u2019 had their first British top twenty hit in 1963 with a Beatles song, I Wanna Be Your Man. ",

The Stones for maybe just shy of two decades The Stones at the time I write this STILL have not had as many hits as the Beatles. As a group. Or even recorded as many hits as were written under the Mcartney-Lennon copywrite. Or as many written by Paul Mcartney. I didn't Google any of this and could be wrong. Im fairly confident in my ascertions tho. So feel free to refute my claims if they are debatable. ",
