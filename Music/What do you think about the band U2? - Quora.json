            "answer_text": "I probably would not have answered this question had my sister not rung me a few weeks back excited that U2 was touring. So I surprised her and got tickets to see them this upcoming spring. But that would be a lie. A few weeks prior to getting the tickets, the fact of the matter was that I was starting to listen to \u201cAchtung Baby;\u201d so much so that I listened to it over 20 times in one week. \u201cZoo Station\u201d was fun, \u201cEven Better Than The Real Thing\u201d was great, and I absolutely loved \u201cMysterious Ways.\u201d I really think of it as their masterwork. It wasn\u2019t always like that. I guess now that I\u2019m in my thirties I\u2019m trying to either reconnect with bands that I hadn\u2019t listened to since many years ago (like this past summer I started listening to REM again\u2014I\u2019d hadn\u2019t listened to them since I was 14 and ate up their entire back catalog) or listening to bands or musicians I never imagined I\u2019d listened to. U2 is one of those groups. Growing up, they were everywhere, and I pretty much said they were a lot like The Beatles\u2014critically acclaimed, very popular, icons really. Their stuff never clicked with me. I got through \u201cAchtung Baby\u201d about halfway when I was 14 (my dad had a copy for some reason) and I thought it bored me. \u201cAll You Can\u2019t Leave Behind\u201d was overplayed, \u201cHow to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\u201d was horrible, and listening to the singles from \u201cNo Line On the Horizon\u201d was just\u2026ugh. However, rediscovering \u201cAchtung Baby\u201d back in September made me explore their back catalog and while it\u2019s taken a while for the stuff to sink in\u2026man, it\u2019s pretty good stuff! The early albums are quite atmospheric and set the stage for what they would do later on; the best of the bunch easily being \u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d (their best album next to \u201cAchtung Baby\u201d). \u201cRattle and Hum\u201d was a bit tedious at first, but second time around I appreciated what they were trying to do with roots music. The only one from the \u201880s, interestingly enough, that I cannot click with is \u201cThe Joshua Tree.\u201d Some cool tracks here and there, but I\u2019ve heard better. The \u201990s stuff isn\u2019t too bad, either! I initially wrote off \u201cZooropa\u201d as a disappointment (I got it at a discounted price on Amazon), however subsequent listens make it the logical step forward next to \u201cAchtung Baby,\u201d and even though Johnny Cash sounds quite out of place in its closing track, \u201cThe Wanderer,\u201d for some reason it works. Definitely an album of high production values, and not too much of an overstatement to call it the \u201990s \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d (although, with all due respect to U2, \u201cZooropa\u201d doesn\u2019t come close). Even \u201cPop\u201d (I got it for $4 last night) has its moments of brilliance, but by that point in the band\u2019s history, their experiments in electronica or social satire or whatever the intention it was had eaten itself up (which is the case in too many realigning chapters in the ongoing history of rock music). I really have no interest in listening to the stuff after \u201cPop,\u201d but completist that I am, I\u2019ll probably get the rest of their catalogue. Why not? As for the band and their place: they were post-punk, but took it from a spiritual dimension (something that was sorely lacking in their contemporaries\u2019 music at the time?). Bono had an interesting crooning voice, their rhythm section is solid, and The Edge has simple but dignified guitar work. The productions of Brian Eno and Steve Lillywhite helped take their sound and make it sound atmospheric\u2014almost heavenly. Not everything they\u2019ve done were masterpieces, but the results most certainly are interesting. I\u2019m appreciative of it, and who knows, I might one day consider myself\u2014dare I say it\u2014a fan. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re one of my all time favourite bands. You\u2019ll find that common to a lot of these answers because the question has \u201cU2 (Band)\u201d as one of the topics which means it is appearing in the feeds of a lot of people who follow that topic. And it stands to reason that a lot of people who follow that topic will be U2 fans. Anyway - they are one of my favourites. I won\u2019t say I like all their stuff but I do absolutely love some of their stuff. I find it fascinating how their career has unfolded. The band is now almost 40 years old. Try to think for a moment of another band who have stayed together and performed together for 40 years with the same original line up and achieved the level of success they have had. There\u2019s no one else. It\u2019s simply phenomenal and I think a lot of people take that for granted. The same four kids who started jamming together in a garage in Dublin in the late 1970\u2019s are currently performing in stadiums together. In an age where a lot of marriages don\u2019t make it nearly that far I think it is a credit to all four of them that they have maintained this career together and still seem to enjoy performing together for this long. I also can\u2019t think of another band who have had three distinct career peaks like U2 have had. The first was in 1987 when they released The Joshua Tree and became global megastars. Joshua Tree of course was their fifth album and with each new release they had continued to build upon the success of the previous one and solidify a growing fanbase. They had had career highlights before - performing at Live Aid in 1985 springs to mind straight away.  But with The Joshua Tree album suddenly they were thrust into the upper echelon of artists who could fill an entire stadium themselves and would have to travel with a security details because they were so well known! (with a nod to the undisputed greatest band in the world)  So how did they respond to this level of fame? Well first they recorded a semi-live album (Rattle and Hum) to pay respects to the American music which inspired them - and then they disappeared from the recording studio for three years at the height of their fame\u2026 And ended up in a newly liberated East Berlin to totally reinvent themselves and emerge in their SECOND career peak as a whole new U2 with the album \u2018Actung Baby\u2019 in 1991. (The Fly - first single)  Actung Baby introduced them to a whole new audience and they now seemed worlds apart from the earnest young rock band who had released The Joshua Tree just four years previously. The album of course was another smash hit and some of the singles have become absolutely iconic songs in their own right (\u2018One\u2019, \u2018Mysterious Ways\u2019). This is even more remarkable when you consider the context of rock music in 1991 - grunge was just exploding from Seattle with bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam leading the charge with stripped down, balls to the walls, hardcore hard rock with no flashy costumes or stage pyrotechnics. And yet U2 who had started their career with the same philosophy managed to hit the top of the charts doing the exact opposite! Remarkable! The world tours which followed were - as others have mentioned - full on theatrical stage shows with enormous screens and at one point a giant glittering lemon! U2 continued to pursue their merge of rock music with electronic music through the \u2018Zooropa\u2019 album (1993)  and less successfully in 1997 with the \u2018Pop\u2019 album which fell flat and again left the band trying to figure out where to go next. And again they took some time off to figure out who they were as a band and what they wanted to be. And they figured out they are a rock band - and that they had lost sight of that. So as the 21st Century began they once again re-invented themselves or in this case - re-de-invented themselves and returned to those basics as they once again applied for the job of \u201cgreatest rock band in the world\u201d.  It was indeed a Beautiful Day when U2 released \u2018All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind\u2019 in 2000 and again returned to the top of the charts (in an era when pop music reigned supreme and rock music was struggling) with an enormous album which was both a critical (multiple Grammy winners including Song and Record of the Year) and commercial hit (12 million copies + sold) and once again U2 had hit the peak of success - for a third time! This time though they followed up with another enormous album (2004\u2019s \u2018How to Dismantle and Atomic Bomb\u2019) and hit singles including Vertigo and the heartbreaking Sometimes You Can\u2019t Make it On Your Own.  The band has continued to perform and record in the years since and while it hasn\u2019t reached the peaks of the 1987, 1991 and 2000\u20132004 eras it has continued to be a top selling live act and continues to record new music in an age where most of their contemporaries are content to tour and play their old hits to nostalgic audiences. So what I do I think of them? They are amazing and absolutely unique. And Bono is probably the greatest person who has ever fronted a rock band. People call it arrogant when Bono tries to use his fame to achieve political or social change. I don\u2019t call the arrogant - I call it generous. He could quite easily have chosen to sit at home and snort cocaine off the backs of strippers. Instead he chose to try to change the world. What the hell is wrong with that? ",
