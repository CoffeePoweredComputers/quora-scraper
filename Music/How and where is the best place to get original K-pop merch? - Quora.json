            "answer_text": "Well for the first thing, the most accurate place to get original Kpop merchandise would be the Entertainment Company run stores. Such as Bighit Entertainments Weverse Shop app. My personal choice for original merchandise would be Cokodive. They are a South Korean based Kpop Merchandise Online Store and are know for selling legitimate Kpop merch, aswell as providing free international shipping. The prices are pretty much the same as the prices of the entertainment company stores, however i would like to make it ware that Cokodive takes no responsibility for any extra charges you may face after processing the order. Eg. They don't cover Import tax. You won't always get import tax but it cna occur. Out of the 13 times I've ordered form them, 3 had import tax alongside once they arrived at my address (40\u201350 pounds). One shop I'd definitely wouldn't trust is BTS MANIA. There Army boxes are completely rip-off filled with cheap merchandise and have an awful customer service team. I accidentally ordered two of the Army box and appeal for my order to be changed, which in the policies must be done within 24 hours. I had sent the email request 30 minutes after the order. They then kept trying to make excuse as to why they couldnt give me the refund, at first they tried to claim that it wasnt done within the first 24 hours, when I provided screenshot they then made another excuse, and it got to the point where my mother threatened to call up trading standards and then all of a sudden they were magically \u2018Allowed\u2019 to give me the refund for one of the boxes.
