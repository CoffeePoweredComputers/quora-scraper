Could well be the \u201cFletcher-Munson curve\u201d, see Jose Fornari\u2019s excellent answer. Could also be along the lines of what Surya talks about - factory Bose systems are dynamically equalized and the bass essentially stops getting louder past a certain output level. Newer ones even have limiters to keep the associated amp channels from going past a given point. Keeps warranty claims down. You may well even be pushing your amplifier stage past its abilities and running into clipping. As the power supply sags, bass gets sloppy and loses impact. The resulting distortion is also high frequency- if you are getting that grainy, harsh sound, and the sound is \u201cbreaking up\u201d, turn it the heck DOWN! Then, go get a stronger amplifier! ",

            "answer_text": "Why does music sound higher pitched when the speaker volume is high? That depends on a lot of variables, but it might be the speakers you are listening on. If they are not well designed, they might not have a flat response curve (some frequencies might sound louder then others) and this effect can increase with higher volumes. It is also possible the designer of your sound system knows the speakers can not cope with a lot of low frequencies so they intentionally decrease the amount of bass when the volume goes up. The sound system in my car does this, unfortunately. The solution is: get good speakers. ",
