            "answer_text": "The song Fly by Sleeping with Sirens. I like it because it\u2019s nice and simple at first and then it just keeps getting better and better. I love the way it sounds and the way it explains things, I love listening to this song. The way the words come together with the instruments being played in the background just sounds absolutely amazing to me. I fell in love with the band Sleeping with Sirens a while ago and I still listen to them constantly because I love them so much. I really recommend the band Sleeping with Sirens to you! ",
