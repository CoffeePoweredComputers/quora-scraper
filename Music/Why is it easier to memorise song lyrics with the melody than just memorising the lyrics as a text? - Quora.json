            "answer_text": "Great question, which I have never thought about. I am not an expert , though it seems I can learn songs quite easily but forget poems, unless they are based on a rhythm. Perhaps it is a mixture of reasons; for me the rhythm, beat or melody helps me keep the pace of a song and having a logical sequence to follow marries the two, which assists in producing a whole recollection. I also think that it could go back to the way we were taught at school using rhythms to reinforce learning, eg one banana, two banana, three banana, four, and that method sticks in later life. To that extent there is something intrinsically primeval about rhythm, that makes us want to dance and sing so maybe it comes from our ancestral roots and is ingrained in a deeper subconscious. Sorry a bit of a ramble, as I am thinking out loud. ",
