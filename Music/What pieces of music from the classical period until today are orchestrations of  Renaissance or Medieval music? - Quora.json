            "answer_text": "The way the main question is worded, taken literally, is asking what pieces of early music have been arranged or orchestrated - in other words they are not new pieces. There's a whole genre of arrangements of such work for modern instruments, usually heavy on the band and brass ensemble since pieces for viols can usually be played without re-arrangement. Here's an example, and arrangement of a pavane by Susato:http://www.manhattanbeachmusic.com/html/the_battle_pavane.html If you mean to ask what new or original works have been inspired by such material you get a whole range of compositions said to be 'inspired' by Renaissance polyphony. The most famous example would be Vaughan Willams' Tallis Fantasy, a great original work. Respighi's Ancient Airs and Dances for the Lute is more of a mere arrangement. You may feel it is based on material not really ancient enough to fit your limitation to Renaissance and before, and that limitation would preclude adding Stravinsky's re-working of Pergolesi in the Pulcinella Suite etc. Most currently popular church/choral  composers like Eric Whitacre and Morten Lauridsen claim Renaissance polyphonic influence , the former's Leonardo Dreams of his Flying Machine being a popular example. There are also more abstruse orchestral works such as Charles Wuorinen's Machaut Mon Chout, in which any references are far more oblique - I heard that piece performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra several years ago and recall only a brief passage for solo double basses that caught the tone of early viol music - just suggested it, not quoted.

            "answer_text": "You are asking two different questions:  use of early music (pre-Baroque) later compositions and original music that is evocative of early music. For the former, there are plenty of examples.  Sometimes it is because the early music remained in the popular musical consciousness for centuries.  For examples, when Berlioz used the Dies Irae hymn in his Symphonie Fantasique, this would have been familiar to audiences.  And when when you hear Ralph Vaughn Williams's Fantasia on Greensleeves, you think \"English folksong\" more than \"renaissance\", but the tune is that old.  In other cases the composer re-uses material, with or without attribution, from earlier sources.  For example, back to Vaughn Williams, and his Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis.  You probably don't recognize the original choral tune from the hymn \"Why fum'th in fight the Gentiles spite\".  But the piece certainly is evocative of early music.   Similarly, you may not know the music from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, but that collection was the source material, heavily adapted, by William Walton, for portions of his film score for the movie Henry V. There are also composers who stylistically evoke early music without necessarily quoting a particular work.  Good examples would be the Estonian Arvo P\u00e4rt,  try perhaps his Passio.  Also, Armenian-Ameircan, Alan Hovhanness, maybe try his Symphony No. 2 \"Mysterious Mountain\".  Also, American Randal Thompson, his choral works show a purity that hearkens back to Palestrina. Finally, if you want something that is closer to Resphigi's Ancient Airs and Dances, a modern orchestration of a dance suite, then look for Gordon Jacobs's William Byrd Suite, in that case an arrangement for wind band.
