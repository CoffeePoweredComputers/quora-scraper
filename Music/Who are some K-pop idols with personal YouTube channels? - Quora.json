I think this is the most personal one, she uploaded 5 vlogs so far <3 VIXX\u2019s Hongbin, he has been doing gameplays for a while now, he started on Twitch, but he has a youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtl1BsH_JKGYspPxUx8zRvw (he\u2019s probably one the best idol gamers from what I understand :) )",
