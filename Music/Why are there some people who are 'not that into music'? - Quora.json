            "answer_text": "Maybe, they don\u2019t connect to music emotionally. Being a musician, i can understand why the notes are put the way they are and what you have to do to produce a sound on a particular instrument. I\u2019ve played songs and sang songs in public and in private and I feel the emotion that the writer was trying to convey. People not into music don\u2019t have that emotional connection. They listen to music and like a song, but it doesn\u2019t stir anything in them to look past notes played together and words in a melody. My perfect example would be my sons. One is a drummer and the other is a computer/video game hobbyist. The drummer loves music; my computer son likes music but never played an instrument or sang in a chorus, so music never really touched him inside. I hope this is helpful! Markd ",

            "answer_text": "That are some good answers here already. I find the question challenging to answer, because \u201cbeing into\u201d something is subjective. Music speaks to people differently and it serves different purposes in their lives. As mentioned below, those highly trained as musicians have a relationship with music beyond listening pleasure. I find myself analyzing music as I hear it (what\u2019s that chord progression, that was an unexpected interval, etc.). This doesn\u2019t take away the joy of music for me\u2026it enhances it. I have known people brought to tears by a piece of music, while at the same time, another person falls asleep because they are bored. As with most things, we are unique creatures with complex minds - the wondrous variety is what makes us so special! ",
