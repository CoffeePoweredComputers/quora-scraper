            "answer_text": "Have you heard Anesthesia\u2014(Pulling Teeth) by Cliff Burton (Lars is kinda there too but not really)I\u2019ve always worshiped Cliff, and so did my dad. He\u2019s my all time favorite bass player and I really aspire to be like him, and this was the first time I ever actually heard a bass being played like a guitar. This was the thing that really changed the music world for me, I think the song really shows Cliff\u2019s musical ability, and it saddens me to know that he was taken away from the metal world so early. Another amazing bass solo to me was Cliff\u2019s solo(s) in Orion, which starts around the four minute mark and about six minutes and thirty seconds in. Orion means a lot to me, especially since it was a staple in my childhood. This once again shows how musically talented and confident Cliff Burton was. It is a beautiful piece.  (Orion, Solos start at 4:00 and 6:37)  (Bass Solo\u2026 Take One) ",

            "answer_text": "With so many guitarists which are extremely technical and use sophisticated techniques it's very hard to pick up a great player. However a player who can give you goosebumps is a better player than a technically fit musician. I would like to share a few instances from my favorite bass player : FLEA (RHCP)  Here are some of the instances where his music really gels with whats the musical aura of other band members around him : 1.Don't Forget me : Chorzow   The intro and the outro are phenomenal! 2. Permutation   The way the music entwines into each others notes is breathtaking. 3 Slane Castle - Californication Intro   Most people hear what John has to offer but he could not have hit that solo so perfectly without flea to support him. 4.Wet Sand (Original Track)  I would miss anything in the world to hear that first bass note live ! That's the genius of FLEA ! He is GOD. PERIOD . ",
