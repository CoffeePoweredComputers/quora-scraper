            "answer_text": "2? They\u2019re definitely releasing 1 before Jin heads off to the military\u2014and that\u2019s rumored to be in January. Since that\u2019s in January, and BTS tends to have 2 comebacks a year, they MIGHT release another album later in the year? So\u2026 Namjoon, about a month or two ago, had said that they were \u2018working on the new album\u2019. I suspect that MOTS: Shadow has already been finished back in June or July, since they have time (or maybe not) on their hands. I assume that the \u2018new album\u2019 he was talking about was Ego. And since Jin isn\u2019t gone yet, he could be in Ego!! Yay!! So we could get a final 2 OT7 albums! That would also come with 2 OT7 MVs and comebacks so Jin wouldn\u2019t be completely gone! Just a theory. It could only be 1, but I\u2019m hoping for 2. ",

Plus they released two hints during MMA Map of the soul: Egoand the intro video was basically them and their shadowsAfter the studio album I\u2019m expecting a mini album which will NOT be a compilation one. We will get one album before the first members enlist. I have a two months in mind for releases February and June. I think BTS have sufficient pre recorded songs to still release albums without the members present for promotion. I\u2019m expecting them to tour europe in late 2020. ",
