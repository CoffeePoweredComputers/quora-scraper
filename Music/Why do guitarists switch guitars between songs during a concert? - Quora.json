            "answer_text": "There are usually 5 reasons why a guitar player switches guitars\u2026.. 1) Breaks a string/Out of Tune. I combined these, because usually string breaking with a floating bridge, means out of tune. In larger bands, an out of tune guitar is often easier to solve and FASTER, by just switching guitars. The guitar tech will retune that #1 guitar backstage, and it will go back into rotation. This is how Angus Young in AC/DC would solve an out of tune guitar. You\u2019ll never see Angus tune his guitar between songs. 2) Different Tone. Different guitars sounds different\u2026makes sense. So if a song needs more bite or softer tone, that can be accomplished by changing guitars. 3) Change in tuning. Perhaps a song is in standard 440 tuning. But the next song is tuned 1/2 step down. Maybe the melody is too high for the singer live, so they tune down to make the vocals easier. Well, if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s much easier to change a guitar, than to tune down on stage between songs. 4) Alternate Tunings. Maybe the song is in Drop D (Meaning the top E string is tuned down 1 step to \u201cD\u201d). 5) Change for Change. Some guitar players have huge collections, and they just like to change regularly and show off their collection. Others, like Angus in AC/DC will play their #1 guitar the whole show unless #1. So\u2026How can you tell? If only 1 guitar player changes, it\u2019s probably #1 or #5. If both guitar players switch, it\u2019s probably #2 and #4, especially if the song changes tone. If Bass and guitars ALL change at the same time\u2026it\u2019s #3. Listen carefully, and you\u2019ll be able to tell it\u2019s tuned down. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only speak for myself and the question in general has already been answered. I don\u2019t like to fool around with amp and FX settings on stage. The audience is paying to hear music, not wait for me to dial in the tones for the next song. Therefore, I have different guitars that produce the overall sound I want for the next block of songs. My Gretsch Country Gentleman doesn\u2019t sound a lot like my American Standard Strat and neither of them sound like my SG. It takes me half a minute to pick up a different guitar and leave the amp as is. Broken string (rare with me) is another good reason. I haven\u2019t broken one in ages, but it can happen at any time. Balky guitar / mood (mine, the audience, something else). Sometimes a guitar doesn\u2019t want to stay in tune. Better to pick up another one than to have to keep re-tuning. Sometimes too, I just feel like playing a different guitar. I might use a Tele instead of the CG or Strat. I might use a Flying V instead of the SG. The key here is only that whatever I pick up isn\u2019t going to sound wildly different than what the singer is used to hearing on a particular song. You can arrange sets so you don\u2019t have to keep switching back and forth. For instance, I wouldn\u2019t do one acoustic number sandwiched between two electric numbers. I try to be sure we have at least 3 played on any particular guitar. (I also use an A-B-C box so that all three I might use in a set are plugged in, straps on, ready to pick up, kick on and play.) ",
