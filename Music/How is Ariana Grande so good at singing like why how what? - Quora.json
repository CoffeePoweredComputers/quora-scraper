            "answer_text": "Although in the psychology field there\u2019s still a huge debate on the exact influence of nature (as being \u2018born\u2019 with a certain talent) vs nurture (as being given the opportunity and chance to develop a certain trait), in case of Ariana Grande it\u2019s clear \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018nurture\u2019 are both present. As you may know the mother of Ariana Grande is a CEO. Her mother probably noticed from an early age on her daughter had a natural talent for singing. So she must have encouraged Ariana to express herself given Ariana\u2019s mother has a reasonable income, Ariana will also have had the chance to have some tutoring in singing, acting and dancing. May\u2019be not \u2018formal\u2019 education or a grade as going to music college, but certainly some tutoring was available like private coaching. Her mother will also know who and how to address someone in the artistic field, because one may have been \u2018lucky\u2019 to be born with a certain amount of talent, you still need a network of people to make it flourish (a manager, a music producer, stylists, \u2026 ). One should also be aware that there are many great singers, but unlike Ariana Grande they might not have the support or the network or the commercial knowledge like the mother of Ariana to make their talent flourish. So to answer your question: Ariana was certainly born with talent, but she was also plain \u2018lucky\u2019 to be the daughter of someone who nourished that talent and who must have addressed the right people to make her daughter shine. One simply needs nature and nurture and even when both are present it\u2019s certainly no guarantee you\u2019ll end up in the limelight but at least it offers the best start. ",

            "answer_text": "she undoubtedly has had talent since she was young and has worked extremely hard to build up her voice. she has insane vocal abilities and the two times i\u2019ve seen her live absolutely blew me away. but she\u2019s not the only vocalist and many people have or can develop singing skills. if you want to sound good, do a little research on singing and tips on how to improve. practise often and work hard. it takes lots of time and patience to master singing skills, especially to sound professional like ariana. a vocal coach would help a lot and would help you to use actual techniques. :) ",
