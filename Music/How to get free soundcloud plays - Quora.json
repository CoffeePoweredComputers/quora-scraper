            "answer_text": "This problem is actually easy to solve but it requires time, discipline, and a shift in mental thinking. When it comes to marketing, all money really does is expedite time. Money speeds up the time it takes to build an audience or develop relationships, etc. So if you don't want to spend money on your campaign, then I suggest you spend time earning your audience. Here are a few tips:  Follow listeners on soundcloud and engage with them.Spend time remixing popular songs, publish them to your account and promote them.Spend time building relationships with other popular artists who can help you build credibility. Spend other people's time promoting your work by building a digital street team.Hire an intern and share your knowledge in exchange for their time.Spend time performing live shows and promoting your Soundcloud profile.So in summary, if you don't want to spend money marketing your Soundcloud account, then either spend time doing it yourself or learn how to barter.
