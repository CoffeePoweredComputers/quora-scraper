            "answer_text": "Oh boy, here we go. I think you can interpret \"Old ARMYS\" in two ways. People that are/were part of the Fandom for a long time.People who are over 20 years old.I'm both. I'm 29 years old now and I started to stan BTS even before they had their debut or a Name for their fans. As of now, if I were still part of the Fandom, I would be with BTS for 2744 days. I'm into K-Pop since around 2009 and I liked other BigHit Artists, so I got introduced to them very early. I followed them Pre-Debut and really liked their vibe. So I waited for their debut and I loved it. So much, they quickly became my ult-group. But what changed? In short: EVERYTHING. 2018 was the time where I started to distance myself from the Fandom and the Group. But before that, I was super proud of them. They were so unique back then. So unique in fact, that they didn't have many fans. Back then we ARMYS worked so hard, to get a certain amount of views on their videos, the numbers are laughable now since they get those views within minutes. The first time they went a little viral was with DOPE. I was so happy to see them getting the recognition they deserved and then came Blood, Sweat, and Tears and they got even more recognition. The fandom was so proud of the boys and during that time I noticed how quickly the fandom grew bigger and bigger. And of cause, I was happy for them! BTS getting 2Mil followers on twitter was a huge milestone back then. Now the number is laughable. BTS and ARMY got so big that they even won a Daesang. Back then, NOBODY expected it and that is when I noticed another change in the fandom that had nothing to do with the size of the fandom. They got greedy as heck. The first Billboard Award was a historic event, and again, I was so proud, finally seeing BTS getting recognized in the US - now looking back, this is where it all started to end for me. I wasn't just an ARMY stan. I always were a multi-stan and will forever be. I never felt like that was a bad thing, but after BTS got so big, it suddenly became a bad thing, to like other artists as well. Why? I will never know. I don't get why ARMYS would imagine they are something better if they are \"Pure Blood ARMYS\". Suddenly you were only allowed to mention other groups when you hated them. So yeah, the bigger the Fandom grew, the more toxic it grew. As a multi-stan (even with BTS as your ult-group) you were throwing BTS under the bus - just because you also like other groups. So...toxic fans were one reason why I distanced myself from the fandom. But that's just the fandom. I still enjoyed BTS' music and content. Until I didn't. I wasn't the biggest fan of Fake Love (and got attacked for it - since, there is this rule in the Fandom, that you have to like EVERYTHING the boys put out and every new song is the best song they ever made. Do you think Fake Love was the Best Song? Well, you have to change your opinion, because IDOL just dropped, so now you have to LOVE the song or you are a hater.) As a multi-stan, it annoyed the heck out of me, that suddenly BTS won EVERY Award at shows, just because they are BTS, even if they didn't deserve the Award. A song had a bigger impact on South Korea? (Love Scenario for example - you couldn't escape that song. Kids were obsessed with the song, it played in every K-Drama during that time, it was played in every store and variety show.) Doesn't matter. BTS is at the show so their Song wins, even tho it didn't have the same impact. There are so many Awards, I as a multi had given it to other artists. Fake Love was a big turning point for me. I didn't like it. I liked most of the songs on the album, so it wasn't a big deal for me...but the other albums followed and I liked less and fewer songs - and maybe I bust a bubble with this, but K-Pop is a music fandom. I become a fan of a group because I like their songs - not because they are the biggest group in the world right now. So many ARMYS are OBSESSED with the things BTS archived and all they care for is breaking new records. Every Song has to perform better than the last. I purely hate that mentality. All those \"YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR THEM!\" tweets/posts once award season started, made me sick. Maybe because I'm older in age and understand that BTS will not disband just because they didn't get that one award, literally nobody besides ARMY care for. So yeah, once again: The Fandom was a big part of why I left. But, as I said, the music wasn't my cup of tea any longer. I still listen to all the albums when they come out and I will usually find 2 songs that I really like and listen to more often, but overall the music changed too much for me. And that's okay. BTS isn't the first group that changed and that I \"dropped\". It will happen again. That's just how it goes. It also really annoys me, that BTS kinda got hypocritic in their actions. Just two years ago they looked at interviewers super shady, when they got asked if they will release an entire English Song or Album and always said \"We're a Korean group and we sing in Korean. That's just who we are.\" and the fandom was like \"Yeah, how dare you to ask that question? We don't want BTS to release an English song! Other groups might try that but they are losers anyway and a disgrace for even doing so.\" And now? BTS drops an English song, ARMYS forgot that they didn't want an entire English song and once again it's the best song ever and has to perform better than anything ever. So yeah...the fandom shades other fandoms when their faves get westernized as if that is a bad thing and don't realize BTS got westernized themself. ARMYS always praise BTS for writing their own music (what they do less and less) and talking about \"real\" stuff nobody wants to talk about - but news flash. There were groups that talked about depression, school problems before BTS did and there are groups that do it now and there are groups that will do it in the future. BTS didn't invent it, as much as ARMYs want to believe it. so...tldr I guess: BTS changed. Music and Promoting wise and I don't like the change and the fandom got too much for me, so I left it. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really Army. I\u2019m an elder (mid 50s) elder multistan multi genre fan of dozens of acts. I was drawn to BTS because they had an edge. Their music was different yet with mainstream Hiphop, rock, RnB, and EDM dubstep elements. Their message was one of hope in the age of Trump. But with success things changed. Unoriginal content. It started with Persona and them lifting a lot of licks from Western Rock, EDM, and hip hop to almost the point of parts sampling: persona Intro copied lines from RHCP, Dynamite lifted from Timberlake and Maroon 5, singularity ripping off The Weekend\u2019s Call Out My Name, Even On sounds like a Black n white 50s jungle safari movie sound track. etc. SIX BTS SONGS THAT SOUND LIKE OTHER SONGS BTS is just as bad as one of RMs favourite bands; Coldplay. I\u2019m an elder fan rock guitar musician in my 50s so I am old enough to recognize a lot of the licks and riffs they lift. Often they did it in inventive enough ways to come out with something new but lately, it gets tired. I know the Beatles, Led Zepplin, Beach Boys, 70s bands all lifted licks from each other but\u2026 they didn\u2019t last OR they radically changed. But BTS also lost the edginess of Wings. They lost the edgy social critique that drew the original fans. That happened with other socially conscious bands too. The Clash, the Police, Talking Heads, Red Hot Chilipeppers, Green Day. It\u2019s called selling out or just aging. Now they BTS repeating a lot of their formula. The World fiasco was a complete mess up so u can\u2019t blame corona virus. Compare the content put out by AgustD to that of BTS. Suga\u2019s original work is far more interesting than main BTS. Why is that? Must be Big Hit producers. The Japan album was HALF of old Persona - fail. Stay Gold was lame. The first version of Dynamite was terrible, check my comment history, but they saved it with three remixes that are pretty solid. But a complete rip off. I\u2019ve been around a LONG time and many bands come and go. The ones that last: Bowie, The Who, The Stones, U2, Skrillex, Tiesto, Foo Fighters, XJapan, Rush, OneOK Rock are/were all reinventing themselves with different styles and genres while keeping their own sounds. Also there is a whole generation of Kpop bands that have been killing it over the last six months with original high quality, massive energy tunes and albums: TXT, Ateez, Day6, MonstaX, and Stray Kids are have all had really great recent aBlum releases. If the companies, promototers, the lawmakers in the country make it so these Kpop bands get disposed of or put on military hiatus every seven years: or let management/group leaders bully each other into quitting. Or let these idols get into scandal trouble after years of managers purposely delaying their normal social development. By starving them and cutting them up with surgery or working them into depression and suicide. IF the industry, the fandoms, the country and society just throw these young people away every seven, ten years then why SHOULDNT older fans just move on. It\u2019s not like this phase of a group is going to last in this genre. They are ALL disposable and lately BTS is coming out with unoriginal disposable cotton candy that will never last. So why be that loyal? They\u2019re are too many other fresh groups across East Asia, Europe, Latin, Africa and the World. What can BTS do? All the ideas below to focus on musical talent Renegotiate their contracts and go on hiatus to do military service together. If any group has a good chance at comeback after two years, after Covid, it is BTS.Get control of original music by doing solo projects.Stop with the photo shoots, product endorsements, video game worlds, appearances on TV series and focus on the music.stop seeking awards, collaborations, and stop using outside writers and producerskeep exploring new forms of EDM and rock fusion stylesPut out a live album video of their 2019 tour. (I\u2019ve seen the Wembley and elsewhere footage - looks awesome.Take the Remix of Dynamite and do a whole EDM album of greatest hitsDo an unplugged or acapella album of popular tunes.Do an album of cover tunes - in Korean. A couple in EnglishDo a Christmas carols Or Winter Holiday albumStop running a fan club or fandom. Include fandom with more behind the scenes stage work And rehearsal. Focus on your professional lives, not personal lives.Take time offscreen to have a personal life, see family, date, get laid (safely), get married or cohabitate.Take time to coproduce other artists music.Take time OFF to work on non music arts projects like photography, videography, art shows, and actingWrite an autobiography or a travel memoir.Get more involved in the charity and community work you do; to the level of BonoMake a really weird experimental totally new album like the White album or Ok Computer but focus not on some video game themechange from doing an award show circuit to playing Music festivals when they start up againBasically enough all the Vlive promotional, video game, non-music crap. Focus on THE MUSIC or artistic projects.. Get back to being a real band but get more involved in REAL life. Look at what Gackt does. He goes out on the streets to raise money, visits high schools to speak and perform, runs a huge charity AND puts out major albums and sound tracks every couple of years. That\u2019s how I see BTS going on through the next decade. This merry go round promotional circus they are on now is unsustainable. HOME | Charlesemery ",
