            "answer_text": "Knowing the scales (particularly where the black keys must be played) makes it easier to play any song on the piano by ear and in any key signature. Most songs will also modulate between different keys, so knowing the scales will help you play the melody by ear without striking a sour note. In theory, however, it may be possible to play by ear without knowing your scales if you play all songs in the key of C (no black keys) or A major (only one black key), while remembering via muscle memory to play the notes at III-IV and VII-VIII as adjacent keys when playing in a major key and playing the notes at II-III and V-VI as adjacent keys when playing in a minor key - particularly when playing melodies on the right hand. When playing chords on the left hand, put into muscle memory the finger spacing between pinky and middle finger for playing note interval 3, and finger spacing between pinky and thumb for playing note interval 5 to help you identify the root note by feel from below the melodic note. If the pinky happens to bump up against a black key, then play the black key as the root note. Next, form a fixed claw with three fingers to play the root note and the notes at 5 and 8 note intervals above the root note. If and when the middle finger happens to touch and bump up against a black key, then play that note as a sharp/flat key. To put all of these pointers together, here\u2019s how one can in theory learn to play piano by ear without actually learning to play the scales: 1) Memorize the melody so you can hum the whole song in your head 2) Play the song on the right hand in key of C (see video for more details) 3) Sight & locate the melodic note (played on the main down beats) you are about to play on your right hand & immediately locate & play the bass note at 1, 3 or 5 intervals BELOW the melodic note **KNOWING WHICH BASS NOTE SHOULD BE PLAYED ON A BLACK KEY** 4) Play or roll simple chords from notes at 1-5-8 intervals ABOVE each bass note (or 1\u20133\u20135 if your familiar with your scales) **KNOWING WHICH NOTES IN THE CHORD TO PLAY ON A BLACK KEY**  ",

            "answer_text": "As has been said in previous answers, scales are great exercises to develop strength and sound memory through playing. However, what I lack seeing in the answers here are the fun facts of scales. These are the benefits that I tell my students about: They are useful. if you would ever like to arrange or write music, scales, along with arpeggios, are the building blocks of most embellishments. To make a piece sound pretty, you can use scales to climb between notes, while bringing out the distinct sound of the piano (or guitar, harp, violin etc.).They are impressive. If you look up people playing scales at 240 rpm or greater, that\u2019s all they really need. Even some performances of scales or exercises from Hanon\u2019s are said to stir audiences with awe. There are different arrangements of scales, too, as in scales in thirds, in octaves, etc. These are pretty challenging but very rewarding, just like a high video-game level, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.They can be fun, too, I swear! Honest! I love scales, just like I love jumping jacks. When they start working, when they come naturally, when you don\u2019t have to think so much about them anymore, they can be sort of mind-clearing, relaxing, and entertaining. Mildly challenging, just like Candy Crush. And when you\u2019re learning them, you\u2019re really flexing your brain muscles, increasing your coordination.They are didactic. They\u2019re the kind of exercise that your mind can always look back and refer to when playing any style of music, especially jazz, pop, and classical. They\u2019re used often in so many pieces of music, and when you get to that point of the song, you\u2019ll be like \u201cwow, that was easy,\u201d and it sounded great too!There aren\u2019t only 24! There\u2019s a whole world of scales, actually, from different cultures, full of history and tradition. The cool part is that some sound so out there, so unique, that just by playing the scale, you can feel like you have taken a step into another culture, another world. I.e. all of the arabic traditional scales (ie Maqam), indian ragas, pentatonic, etc.Overall, scales are the heart of composing music, from everywhere around the world. Learning these scales will make creating music so easy and natural, it\u2019ll be like eating ice cream. You\u2019ll be impressive, creative, brainy, and in touch with the greats, like Mozart, like Edvard Grieg, like Hans Zimmer. ",

Of the remaining scales most are similar and some don\u2019t use the fifth finger at all. Now look at any conventional piece of music by any of the great composers and make a note of the fingering. You will see that the fifth finger is used an awful lot, just as much as the other fingers if not more. So the fifth finger, the least strong finger, the one that needs the attention is almost ignored. And the next weakest finger, the fourth is exercised half as much as the remaining three as essentially all scales break down as a 1231234 configuration in some form or other. Then look at where scales actually occur in pieces of music and observe that very often the fingering is quite different to the scale for logistical reasons. As I pointed out, five scales have identical fingerings as do many of the remaining ones. I personally don\u2019t see a lot of point in playing G if you can play C unless you need to familiarise yourself with the keys, although it\u2019s not rocket science remembering to sharpen the F. Such knowledge can be obtained without drilling the fingers unnecessarily. Don\u2019t get me started on minor scales\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I dont think so, but it isn't a popular opinion. Each time you practice something on the piano, you are learning a new technique, whether they are scales, arpeggios, or passages from pieces. If you master scales, you will become very good at passages that are played most similar to the scale that you learned. Some of the skill will carry over to passages that are a bit different. But practicing passages from pieces can also improve your skills that can carry over to other pieces. From my personal experience, the technique I gained from mastering actual pieces carried over to other pieces and back to scales much better than the technique gained from practicing scales, where the carry over to pieces was not as efficient. Most importantly, my practicing pieces that have scale-like passages (Clementi, Bach, etc) enabled me to master scales with respectable speed without my actually spending much time on the scales. The time I would have wasted on practicing scales I actually mastered numerous pieces. ***Try it yourself.Practice scales for awhile and see how much that improves your technique when playing pieces. Then take some tine off from scales and practice several technically challenging pieces and see ho much that improves your technique for other pieces. ",

All piano teachers would recommend learning scales, and for good reason - many of the skills that are important for learning piano are developed in practicing scales: Independent finger movementMuscle memory for spacings between keysPromoting good finger and hand shapeLearning how to manage accidentalsIncreasing staminaImproving the dexterityAll-round greater strength and finesseEasy pieces are very manageable without scales, however. If you are just looking to play something nice and beginner, such as Fur Elise, then scales are not strictly necessary. Practicing technical exercises are very boring and time-consuming, but the long-term gain is immeasurable. While not necessary, scales are something that every serious piano player devotes a great portion of their time into developing, and one I would seriously recommend too. ",

Which is lucky as I need to play them each day for practice. The thing most teachers forget to mention is that you don't have to play tons of different scales every day. That is just silly and a complete waist of time. Just choose two or maybe three scales to practice each day, then you will remember them better. Maybe one major and one minor scale. Also do the same for arpeggios. Maybe if you are still a begginner play the same two scales each day for a week. This way you will rembember the scales better and can move onto some new ones. Then eventually you will know them all. Also C major is not the easiest scale to start with, it has no black keys, and is very uncomfortable compared to many easier ones like E major or B major or F# major. C major is one of the most difficult overall. Of course many teachers begin with this because it makes sense when you study music theory at the same time. ",

I am in no way suggesting that a scale isn\u2019t necessary when in context. But as an exercise? Total waste of time. The main reason for this is that the fingering on a plain old scale will almost always differ from that of the scale in a piece of music. The type of finger movement that we use to execute a scalar pattern can be learned through actual music. It also doesn\u2019t drive students insane. If someone wants to learn scales, by all means, do it. It\u2019s not going to be harmful, but just don\u2019t rely on it too heavily. To learn scales, look no further than Mozart. ",

This is due to inertia and ignorance among other factors, but things are beginning to change thanks to the information age. Be aware that finding an uniform piano keyboard is currently not easy, but you might be interested by some commercial alternatives, e.g. The dualo principle  - dualo . For more information, you can start here: Jank\u00f3 keyboard or even check my own page The Bilinear Uniform Chromatic Keyboard (BUCK) also available in French and Italian. Below are quotes from famous pianists about the Jank\u00f3 keyboard: This invention will have replaced the present piano keyboard in fifty years' time! -(Franz Liszt \u2013 His prediction was wrong however.)

They\u2019re also an objective sign of evidence that you are not just learning the piece by ear and do indeed understand the musical theory of your level (or higher). They speed up the process of engraining the keys into your head and improve certain hand techniques that naturally come with it. They\u2019re one of the requirements in examination when passing a grade, to show what you know in terms of how the notes work. This expands into melodic minor scales that combine major and minor together and incorporate the relative major of that minor scale. Can a person become a concert pianist without learning scales? I think so. However, much more would need to be learned on paper rather than just practising a technique to save you time and improve your fingering skills, so the learning I think would be much harder in the long-run.

I don't want you to spend all your time going through the scales, of course, but you need to run through the scale associated with the key of the piece you are going to learn.  There will be scale passages in classical music (and in popular pieces, as well.)  Think of the 1st mvt. of Mozart's Sonata in C.  Scale runs!   Generally, students use scales as part of a daily warm-up.  Don't do them mindlessly.  Do a one- or two-octave runthrough of whichever scale you've been assigned that week every day when you start to practice.  This is also a good time to do any exercises, be they Hanon, Czerny, or something your teacher has clipped out of a current piece.  Then your fingers will be warmed up and you can launch into practicing your piece(s).  Don't stress about it!  But it's good to know the scale and also the I-iv-V chord cadence for every key you're going to play in. ",

If you have an arpeggio you find the way to play it, if you have a scale you solve the problem with correct fingering. I think there is an advance in not doing scales: Instead of thinking in a sequence of notes, a scale, an arpeggio, you can focus in each sound and find fingering that favours the way it must be. Not every scale should sound the same way, not every 16th note should be exactly as the previous one. Finaly, as well as there are great pianists doing hours of scales, there are many bad pianist doing the same hours of scales. ",

This ORDER is very important simply because it sounds good, and also to give meaning and understanding to the notes; not just straight memorization. Scales are a big part of our music note patterns, and also a big part of our technique in nimble and knowledgeable finger movements. ",

It is so much more efficient to learn all the scales and memorize and apply them to your pieces, rather than learn each scale while you are learning your piece. While practicing scales, it is a good time to practice your hand positions. You will also learn some basic music theory. So, all in all, learning scales will only benefit you.  ",

To be able to play the piano well you need to have good dexterity in your fingers, and the best way to build up that strength is by practicing scales. yet perhaps the most difficult instrument to master. ... To compensate, the piano is a polyphonic instrument. This means that it can play many notes at once, thus increasing the complexity many times over. Similarly, playing the piano necessitates coordinating the hands, which are mirror images of each other. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Play Piano material there... ",

Your tetrachords will also help greatly when learning other scales. ",
