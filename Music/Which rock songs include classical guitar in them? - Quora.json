            "answer_text": "Good answers already given. Here are a couple more, and if they\u2019re not all strictly rock, too bad. . .I\u2019m putting them here anyway! -Eric Clapton\u2019s Unplugged version of Tears in Heaven. -Queen Innuendo (flamencoesque guitar spot by Steve Howe). -Pistolero by Juno Reactor, kind of a techno piece, but cool flamenco-like guitar by Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens. He uses a pick, but I\u2019ll forgive him. Steven also has a whole album out of him playing rock pieces on nylon called \u201cFlamenco a Go Go\u201d. -Suzanne (and pretty much everything else) by Leonard Cohen. -Beatles: And I Love Her (Harrison, a Ramirez); Till there was you; I\u2019ll be back. -Dee, Rhandy Rhodes (classical guitar version on the Tribute album). -To Live is to Die, Metallica. Battery is another piece that opens with classical guitar, though it has a slight saturated/overdriven sound. -Obsession-Confession by Slash (yeah. ..the one from Guns N Roses). . .sort of a nuevo flamenco piece. Its not really rock, but this one was actually a hit for him, and so unlike what he\u2019s usually known for I feel like I should mention it. -Who Let the Dogs out, by the Baja men. (Yes, seriously) Has a classical guitar arpeggiated part the last 20 or so second of the song.   ",
