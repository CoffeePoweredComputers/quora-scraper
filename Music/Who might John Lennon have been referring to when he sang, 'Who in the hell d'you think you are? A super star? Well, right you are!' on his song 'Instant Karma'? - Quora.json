            "answer_text": "John is singing to EVERYONE! The theme of the song is that we\u2019re all stars\u2014famous or not. This was one of John\u2019s most positive songs\u2014\u201dWE ALL SHINE ON.\u201d \u201cKarma\u201d refers to a person\u2019s deeds across a cycle of lifetimes, and to their consequences for that person\u2019s spiritual fate. John knew that \u201cInstant Karma,\u201d then, is a contradiction in terms. But John loved the idea of selling \u201cInstant Karma\u201d like it was instant coffee. He was fascinated by advertising and slogan songs. In London, John wrote the song in a single morning, skipping the Beatles recording session in which the Beatles completed Paul\u2019s \u201cLet It Be.\u201d Phil Spector was in London to talk to Allen Klein about producing \u201cLet It Be.\u201d John called him up and said, \u201cCome over to Abbey Road. I\u2019ve just written a monster.\u201d John quickly got a band together consisting of George Harrison, Klaus Voormann and Alan White. John played the piano and sang. From the day John wrote it to the day the single charted was 10 days\u2014one of the fastest released songs ever. John believed that every human being had the potential for spiritual greatness. And he believed that we should all take responsibility for the fate of the world. John believed that he could change people\u2019s minds with music. He said that the essence of \u201cInstant Karma\u201d was to breathe belief into people. \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to say in the world is that you\u2019re gonna be great,\u201d he said. WE ALL SHINE ON, LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS AND THE SUN. ",

            "answer_text": "John reportedly told Alice Cooper that Instant Karma was about Paul. Can't remember where I read this offhand, but it makes sense reading the lyrics, given his anger at that time and the fact that quite a few of their songs were directed at each other, or about what was going on in their lives, particularly in this period. I'm sure he intended it to have universal meaning as well and not be too obvious. ",
