            "answer_text": "Arjit Singh\u2019s songs make us cry. I agree with that. Either you get emotional by listening to them or you just start crying because you just felt the lyrics by heart. But,in my case,I cried listening to them because the tune was so soothing and the way he sings them,you can feel it even though you don\u2019t understand the lyrics. It is his method of superb singing skills that bring the emotions out and make us cry. I have cried listening to BEKHAYALI(from \u2018Kabir Singh\u2019),for no reason. !!! I hope your question was answered correctly. What do you say Arjit Singh fans!!? ~Swathi Bhat :) ",
