            "answer_text": "For girl groups, I believe Hi Cutie is the youngest in terms of average age. The oldest member is born in 2003 and the youngest is born in 2006.  The next youngest is probably Busters with the oldest born in 2001 and youngest in 2005.  Both girlgroups debuted in 2017 so you can imagine how young they were at debut. The youngest boy group is probably 1the9? They came from the surgical show \u201cUnder19\u201d where the trainees were all under 19. They have members ranging from oldest born in 1999 to the youngest born in 2003.  ",
