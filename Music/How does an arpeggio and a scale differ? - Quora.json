            "answer_text": "A scale is a set of notes grouped together in a \u201cfamily\u201d and conceived as being linear and in order: for example: A B CD EF G A is an A natural minor scale (7 note scale) and A C D E G A is an A minor pentatonic scale. (5 note scale). A chord, (notice the word is similar to cord or accord) is a group of at least three different notes that can be played at once (a block chord) or played separately in time (an arpeggio). Although it's commonly taught that the scale produces chords (and it's fine to look at it this way) I think of it in reverse, that chords produce scales. The reason, is that there's a phenomenon known as the harmonic series which is that each single note produces itself and a series of other tones higher than itself, for example, the note C produces C C G C E G Bb C (there's more but I'm stopping at 8 parts for now). These notes sound at the same time but the higher parts are very quiet compared to the fundamental. This means that every single note is essentially a dominant 7th chord (C7 in the example) which is a chord. Notice the gaps in the tones- if you only had one string with no means to shorten it you could only play these harmonics- these would be an arpeggio. Each note produces a perfect fifth (the first G in the C series is an octave + a fifth higher than the fundamental. So if each note has a fifth above it, you can chain perfect fifths until you get 12 notes all related by perfect fifths. With some tampering with intervals we call equal temperament, we get back to the original note: C G D A E B F# C# G# A# E# B# B# in equal temperament is the same as C and the sharps have enharmonic equivalents. Put this chain of fifths in \u201corder\u201d and we get the chromatic scale. (C C# D D# E F F# etc) Take a group of three notes and use their strongest harmonics to produce a major scale: F C G (F is a perfect fifth below C and G is a perfect fifth above C). Harmonic series: C C G C E G Bb C G G D G B D F G F F C F A C Eb F Ignore the 7th partial (it's pretty dissonant) and we get C D EF G A BC which is the C major scale. So, that's why I look at arpeggios as creating our basic scales. So, scales and arpeggios aren't all that different, really. They're made up of the same stuff, rearranged. There's quite a bit more to it, but that should get you started. ",

            "answer_text": "A scale is the notes of a particular key arranged in sequence, starting from the tonic (also known as the root note, or key note) and leading up to the tonic one octave above. The main types of scales are major and minor scales. A major scale contains all of the notes of a major key. For example the one octave C major scale would contain the following notes, played in this order: C D E F G A B C A two octave scale would repeat the last seven notes one octave higher: C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C An arpeggio is the notes of a particular chord arranged in sequence, starting from the tonic and leading up to the tonic one octave above. For example, a C major chord is made up of the notes C, E, G, so a one octave C major arpeggio would contain the following notes, played in this order: C E G C A two octave arpeggio would repeat the last three notes one octave higher: C E G C E G C Arpeggios are particularly useful for chord progressions which step outside the key, or modulate (change key) frequently.
