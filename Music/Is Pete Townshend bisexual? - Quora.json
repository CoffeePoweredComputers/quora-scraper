            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of \u201cbisexual.\u201d Is someone bisexual if they\u2019ve had sex with both men and women? If they\u2019ve wanted to have sex with both men and women? If they\u2019ve had long-term romantic relationships with both men and women? If they identify themselves as bisexual? With this in mind\u2026 In his memoir, \u201cWho I Am,\u201d Towshend writes about having had sexual encounters with both men and women, but I don\u2019t recall him actually describing himself as bisexual. His long-term relationships have been with women. I don\u2019t have the book handy, so I can\u2019t give page references, but I believe he names a few names. This is the book where he famously wrote, \u201cMick [Jagger] is the only man I have ever really wanted to f***,\u201d and goes on to describe how good Mick\u2019s equipment looked in pajama pants. As for the encounters with men, I believe he names one or two them (they\u2019re not Jagger!), and says that he let one of them do \u201ceverything but f***\u201d him. (I assumed that by \u201cf***\u201d he meant anal penetration.) So, he doesn\u2019t hide the fact that he\u2019s had sex with men as well as women, but doesn\u2019t seem to identify as bisexual, either. ",
