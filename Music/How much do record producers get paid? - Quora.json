            "answer_text": "Historical standard is a royalty of 3% of RRP or 4% of PPD (what the record company charges iTunes/Amazon).  Producers with track records and/or who are taking financial risk by agreeing to help with a project may get more, and may get advances on those royalties, which can vary from almost nothing to 5 figures per song depending who they and the client are.   If the producer also engineers that may be separately chargeable (or the use of his studio may be) on an hourly or daily rate.    That's the theory anyway.  The reality of what you receive very much depends on other factors (artist/label/song etc) - 4% of nothing is nothing! ",

            "answer_text": "That varies quite a bit. But traditionally they get a percentage of the gross sale of the album. So a successful producer would typically get 5%, some of the really big name producers will just get a flat rate for a project. But nowadays its hard to say, because the music industry is going through a lot of changes and all kinds of new and different deals are being made. ",
