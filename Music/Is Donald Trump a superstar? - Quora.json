Doom on the Electoral College for not following their most basic premise - to prevent an idiot like Trump from getting into the White House. And notice how his rhetoric continues to spur mass shootings and murders. He\u2019s a walking, talking POS who deserves to get his sorry behind THROWN out of Washington, and hopefully, out of the entire United States. Doom on him and all his minions. ",

He is the President, which automatically gives him exposure and press attention. By the above definition, he is certainly a superstar to his base, who fawn over him endlessly. To his base, he fits the definition perfectly. On the other hand, there is sizable portion of citizens (probably a majority, according to polls) who are less than enamored or transfixed by Trump. To them, he\u2019s hardly a superstar, and is not \u201cesteemed for exceptional talent,\u201d is not \u201csought ofter for his or her services,\u201d and is not \u201csuccessful.\u201d So it all depends on perspective. The two sides will argue endlessly and to no meaningful end or purpose, as to his \u201csuperstar\u201d status. ",
