            "answer_text": "TL;DNR: Google \u201cloudness war\u201d Basically, psychoacoustics (the science of how we hear and appreciate sound) tells us that if you play 2 pieces of audio to someone, and one piece is just 3dB louder than the other, assuming all aesthetic arguments are removed, the listener will prefer the louder piece of audio. Just why this is so is related to the Fletcher-Munson curves, which describe how we perceive quantities of bass and treble in audio depending on volume. Spoiler alert: louder (up to a point) gives us a more rich/balanced frequency response. So, the loudness war began with radio in the late 80\u2019s, around the time the first digital peak limiters started to appear. If you could make the music sound louder coming off the CD, then it could go into the broadcast chain hotter and make your radio station sound louder than your competition\u2019s signal. Soon after, the A&R guys in the record companies figured that if we master the hot new single from Disposable Boy Band A just a few dB louder, then people will NATURALLY love it more than the hot new single from Disposable Boy Band B who just happen to be signed to another label. And it just took flight from there. What the A&R guys failed to understand in all of this was twofold: You still need quality product. No matter how loud you make it, shit music still sounds like shit music. And,There\u2019s a limit to how much you can employ this trick before you actually do irreparable damage to the audio. There were some great albums in the 90\u2019s and the naughties that were absolutely smashed in mastering and have never sounded as good as they should have done.Thankfully, over the last 10 years or so, we\u2019ve seen a small amount of sanity return to mastering, although a lot of it is still quite aggressive. But where the big wins have come is with the likes of youtube, spotify et al, who have collectively implemented \u201cvolume normalisation\u201d which means that every thing has to meet a consistent (audio volume) target. Anything that\u2019s squashed in mastering to make it super loud, will simply get turned DOWN by the streaming service so that it plays back at a consistent level with all the other songs being streamed. Things ARE getting better\u2026. slowly. The biggest losers in all of this are the artists and the consumers\u2026. the two parties who really give a toss. Hope this sheds some light. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is: competition. The music biz is a competitive, hit-driven business, and a loud mix - made even fatter by loud mastering - helps your song jump out of radio speakers and grab the listener\u2019s attention. That trend has prevailed, even though radio now has the technology to auto-limit audio to the same loudness. If I fail to master my tracks loud, they sound apologetic and feeble in comparison to a commercial track, and not as punchy as a competitor\u2019s, which is important if I am pitching a TV theme. I would only avoid limiting if the music is for non-featured background (for use under spoken voices). ",
