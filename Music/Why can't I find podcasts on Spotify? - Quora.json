            "answer_text": "Because Spotify is a crappy way to listen to podcasts.  They are simply not set up for it.  Look for most of the big named podcasts and you\u2019ll struggle to find their current episodes.  My recommendation is you go to the app or website for the podcasts you want and support those brands at their home. I\u2019ve tried to get my show consistently published on Spotify and it\u2019s not worth the effort.  They can\u2019t seem to get it right. The other thing is, we\u2019re all trying to figure out how to build an audience.  If the audience is at Spotify, or better at Melody. That\u2019s great for the audience, but what about the artist?  What incentive do they have? If Spotify has the ears, and the audience is getting what they want, is the artist being compensated for their work?  This triangle is poorly balanced at the moment.  Spotify can\u2019t really support the artist, and for now, doesn\u2019t really know how to fix that problem\u2026so the audience is going elsewhere. I hope you enjoyed my answer. Feel encouraged to connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
