            "answer_text": "I think that when it comes to Rolling Stone magazine and what their critics think are \u201cthe best\u201d, Gene Simmons put it very well when he said: \u201cI\u2019m really not too interested in what some aging hippies think.\u201d I feel the same way about it as Gene Simmons does and the funny thing about is, when he described them as \u201caging hippies\u201d that was somewhere around twenty years ago. Whenever someone mentions music critics, I\u2019m also instantly reminded of a quote by Phil Anselmo from the interview he gave at Loyola: \u201cMost writers and media people are wannabe musicians anyway, that can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the truth\u201d! I know what music I like. You know who you like to listen to. Why would I read a magazine written by some wannabe musicians who have the gall to judge the talent of people who actually became rock stars? That would be kind of silly wouldn\u2019t it? Music has no \u201cbest\u201d anyway because the word they\u2019re looking for but are too arrogant to use is \u201dfavorite.\u201d That list in Rolling Stone is nothing more than a list of their favorites. That\u2019s what it is! \u201cThe best\u201d is an objectively evaluable qualification! What objectively evaluable criteria are they using? None. It\u2019s sheer opinion and that\u2019s all it is. ",

With Lauryn Hill, Wu-Tang, Public Enemy, Kanye, Kendrick Lamar, The Notorious B.I.G., Dre, D\u2019Angelo, and more fully entrenched in The Top 50 LP\u2019s OF ALL TIME. But then, Jan Wenner no longer owns Rolling Stone, he is only the publisher now. Penske Media acquired the final 51% of Rolling Stone from Wenner in 2017. Jay Penske\u2019s group also own Variety, The Robb Report, and IndieWire.  above: \u2018What\u2019s Going On\u2019 But, Marvin Gaye and the Funk Brothers musicians who played on \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d, are top-notch! And that LP was the first by a black artist to address social concerns, suffering, injustice, and inner city problems. It was also the first \u201cconcept album\u201d by a black artist and the first record that mentioned the ecological movement, then in its seminal stage. It was also Gaye\u2019s first credited role as producer. \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d was always considered a Top 10 album anyway, since it\u2019s debut in May of 1971. In 1985, the NME considered it the best album ever. ",
