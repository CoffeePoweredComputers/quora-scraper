            "answer_text": "Which K-pop girl groups have the best stage presence? In my field I've spent a good deal of time hanging around excellent singers. And there is one thing they all had in common: confidence. When you look at many of music's pop divas, sure they can be a bit overwhelming. But all that stems from having a great deal of confidence. When you're a great singer, you know it, and you carry yourself accordingly. You know what girl group literally exudes confidence? Mamamoo. It comes off in their performances too. And in my opinion, it's presented in dance as well. When you can blow like them, you don't need to worry so much about how you sound - you know you sound good. Then you can put your attention to all the other things like stage presence. Today's pick is Mamamoo. They are the best in the business. In this particular performance, they control the audience from the very first note. There's sass, personality and loads of confidence.  Okay gogobebe. ",
