            "answer_text": "Liszt was a towering figure in the nineteenth century, and he left a substantial legacy. For this, he is still very much appreciated today\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say he is a maligned figure in any sense. Two observations: The more time I spend with Liszt, the more I appreciate his unique creativity and the extent of his influence.Nevertheless, Liszt was not a terribly consistent composer, and he produced a great deal of music of less-than-stellar quality. He wrote some of my favorite music, but all the same, he rarely competes with Chopin for quality.Posterity doesn\u2019t award laurels for quantity of composition. When Minerva\u2019s owl spreads its wings at dusk, the stars left hanging in the sky shine according to a combination of absolute and apparent magnitude. It\u2019s a more egalitarian environment than the blistering noon, a slightly distorted but ultimately pretty reliable meritocracy. A lot of pianists play a lot of Liszt, but a sizable portion of his work lingers on the fringes of the standard repertoire. Pretty much all pianists play at least some Chopin, and virtually the entirety of his output is now canon. Much of that output is comparatively more accessible and user-friendly than Liszt\u2019s work. But I don\u2019t think this means Liszt is being obscured: nowadays you can get your hands on all the Liszt ever published or recorded with just a few clicks and keystrokes. It isn\u2019t a zero-sum affair. We mustn\u2019t forget that Liszt was among the first great pianists to take Chopin\u2019s music on tour around Europe, even while the composer was still living. Much of Chopin\u2019s dominance in the repertoire beyond the mid-century is thanks to the studio of the great teacher Leschetizsky, who focused heavily on Chopin and taught it to superstar students including Paderewski, Gabrilowitsch, and Esspiova. This was paralleled by Anton Rubinstein, certainly one of the most massively popular pianists of the 1860s and 1870s, who played loads of Chopin and Beethoven. That places Chopin squarely at the center of two of the most important schools of the late 1800s and early 1900s. ",

            "answer_text": "Bluntly \u2026 Chopin was cooler. He didn\u2019t live as long as Liszt and he died of TB, which - if you were a 19th-century artist - was probably the hippest way to go. His output was smaller and less ambitious than Liszt\u2019s. It was also very consistent. And he found his voice effortlessly and instinctively. Liszt on the other hand was prolific, constantly searching and experimenting, and as such his output is much more varied. Some great music - I mean some really great music - but some turkeys too. Chopin didn\u2019t really do the turkey thing. Also \u2026 their lives were very different. Liszt was an amazing individual who seemed to be pretty much up for everything. He was a hyperstar - people literally threw themselves at his feet, fainted when he played in public. And he probably quite liked that for a while, though later in life he found it oppressive. His life was rather dissipated - he lived. He had a number of quite complicated relationships, not least with the Baroness Caroline Sayn-Wittgenstein \u2026 he was a public figure and people were quick to judge him and his work. Look at pictures of Liszt as an old man - he\u2019s clearly someone who just had a massive lust for life and all its complications. Chopin on the other hand didn\u2019t live to be an old man. He had some very refined relationships, most notably with the novelist Georges Sand. She however got rather impatient with him. Chopin seems to have been very self-absorbed and quite in thrall to his own talent (which I find a very endearing trait). He is, in some ways, a quintessential romantic artist (I\u2019d think of the English poets Keats and Shelley as parallels). Perhaps if you think of Liszt as nearer to Byron or Wordsworth it says something about why Liszt won\u2019t ever have the same cachet as Chopin. But he was a hugely influential and highly talented composer. ",
