In the case of Napoleon he was supported by the bourgeoisie, those who owned some wealth, in reaction to the unpredicable revolution who sent probably too many people to the guillotine. He was also fanatically supported by the military, a decisive factor of his longevity. He failed in 1814 mainly because he was betrayed by a greatpart of the marshalls followed by their men. Just an example of his brutality : In France nowadays we are plagued in the south by bush fire in the summer who are started either by accident or by malevolent acts from pyromaniacs.

            "answer_text": " He became that way, not in the military, but in his political dealings. The higher he rose the more dictatorial he became. Napoleon took over in a coup, pictured above. He fired, dismissed, jailed and sometimes killed his political opponents. It had to be done his way, and if not, there were problems for dissenters.

He had a German publisher shot for writing against him, and captured a Bourbon prince and had him shot. ",
