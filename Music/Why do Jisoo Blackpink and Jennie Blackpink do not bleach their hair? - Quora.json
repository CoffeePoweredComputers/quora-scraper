            "answer_text": "Because they usually wear wigs or dye their hair to a darker color, so there\u2019s no reason for them to bleach it. Ros\u00e9 and Lisa bleached their hair because Ros\u00e9 used to have red hair but she changed it to blonde so she didn\u2019t bleached her hair to dye it to the cotton candy color. Lisa didn\u2019t bleached her hair also because she had a brown, kind of blonde hair color and she can just dye through it like Ros\u00e9. I can get you a picture of them in different hair colors just click more.  I couldn\u2019t find a picture of Jennie like this :< Couldn\u2019t find a picture of Jisoo like the one on Lisa.:< Imma just type what hair colors she used to have and now. Jisoo changed the color of her brown hair into black then she got red hair\u2026? And then she got a purple kinda color hair and then she remains brown. Sorry couldn\u2019t find a picture for Ros\u00e9. Imma just type it in rose used to have black hair and then red and then pink and then blonde and then the cotton candy color. ",
