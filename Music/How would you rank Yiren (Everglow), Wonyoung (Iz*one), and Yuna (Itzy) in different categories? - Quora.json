            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no dance nor rap coach so that\u2019s all subjective but i\u2019ll be objective in vocals. this will be a long answer, sorry xx ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~/////~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ dancing: 1.Yuna  why: for me every ITZY member has the skills to be a main dancer in any other group, Yuna has everything and she\u2019s personally for me the best performer not only between these 3 but also in ITZY. I think her biggest issue is that she isn\u2019t as versatile or has shown much versatility like number 2 on the list but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. 2.Yiren  Why: I think Yiren deserves this spot because of how centered her technique is. My sister is a dancer and really likes her hip and torso control. Her background in modern dancing has helped her strengthen her flexibility and gave her a well rounded technique. I think she has some small issues with idol choreos. Like she\u2019s great in modern Chinese dancing but when it comes to idol dancing she sometimes gets too stiff, loses her facials and tends to rush some moves but she\u2019s improving. 3.Wonyoung  Why: although she\u2019s last she\u2019s definitely not a bad dancer not even close. She has sharp movements and shows a good consistency throughout all her performance, her biggest plus point which Yiren doesn\u2019t really have is THAT star stage presence. You can be a weak dancer but have amazing stage presence and make everyone appreciate and like your performances. I\u2019ve watched a video and he/she said that she has issues with her hands, angels, torso control and body balance which to me sound like more serious problems then the other 2. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014next category\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 rapping: 1.Yuna  why: she\u2019s the only one with a high rapping position and i also think she\u2019s in general the best rapper here. It wasn\u2019t untill this album that she showcased actual rapping like in That\u2019s a no no. 2.Wonyoung  why: i placed her higher then Yiren because she has actually showcased some rapping(i think) it was more talking but that\u2019s better then Yiren who has barely showed us anything. 3.Yiren  why: because she hasn\u2019t rapped, simple xx \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014next category\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 vocals: 1.Yuna  why: all 3 are on the weaker side but Yuna has definitely shown way more vocal performances that are technically more correct. She sings very nicely when she doesn\u2019t try to go above her mid belts, like in Dalla Dalla\u2019s bridge she sounds very nice and shows nice dynamics but in Nobody Like You (ik it\u2019s more chanting) but on the \u2018\u2019you\u2019\u2019 parts you can hear her struggling and just pulling up her chest voice. NobodyLikeYouChoreography 2.Wonyoung  why: she\u2019s not really in charge of the vocals neither does she really sing much, she just starts out the song and gets the key phrase of the song. I find it nice how she doesn\u2019t try to force everything out and just sings what she can. She has a nice voice, but she\u2019s way too squeaky and places her voice very much in her nose without any or ture support. 3.Yiren  Why: because she barely sings but from what she has shown during produce she has a nice voice but she\u2019s also very squeaky and nose based. Whenever she sings she\u2019s either flat or doesn\u2019t project properly. In peekaboo she showed no issues with the C5\u2019s but still went into falsetto by how unconfident she is. I think with a little training solely on vocals she will surpass Wonyoung and maybe even Yuna. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014next category\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 visuals (my beauty preference) 1.Yiren  ethereal beauty, she\u2019s Tzuyu Irene and Jisoo\u2019s love child. 2.Yuna  she\u2019s pretty but idk why but i keep on thinking she\u2019ll become even prettier. And then i\u2019ll probably fall in love with her look even more! 3.Wonyoung  she\u2019s one of the people i don\u2019t find attractive but cute, but she has this duality where she can look 23 for sum reason and it\u2019s creepy(good creepy lmao) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014next category\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Group ranking; bias + bias wrecker + favorite song 1.ITZY  I just love how they actually feel/look like sisters or bestfriends. I fell in love with their chemistry before i fell in love with them, i also find all their voices very pretty and very unique. bias; Lia  bias wrecker; Yuna Favorite song; Nobody Like You 2.IZ*ONE  i loved most of their songs and i like their choreo\u2019s, i just sometimes feel that they are more co workers then members ykwim. I know they are a large group so not everyone will be shipped/seen together but there are alot of member who just don\u2019t interact. But then you have Yena and Yuri who actually seem genuine and i would see hanging out together after disbandment. But i mean that\u2019s my opinion, i may be wrong. bias; Nako  bias wrecker: Yena & Yuri favorite song; Fiesta 3.EVERGLOW  they are a very nice group with talented idols and imo the strongest rap line but their concept FOR ME is just getting boring. And i in general prefer cute concepts so that\u2019s already a min point for them. I hope they will do something different JUST FOR ONCE, not a total concept switch. bias; E:U  bias wrecker; Yiren favorite song; Dun Dun if you read everything; I LOVE YOU! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the end\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 bye -:) ",
