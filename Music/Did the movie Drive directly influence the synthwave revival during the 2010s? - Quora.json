            "answer_text": " Drive is a very underrated film with a very good soundtrack by Cliff Martinez. Your question was very intriguing and at first I thought their is no connection between the film and the synthwave revival so I decided to look into it. In addition to Martinez\u2019s score there are some good synthwave tracks on the soundtrack  These are the songs Under Your Spell by Desire  Nightcall by Kavinsky & Lovefoxx  A Real Hero by College  Tick of the Clock by The Chromatics  According to Wikipedia : The release of the movie Drive in 2011, whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists and pushed new fans and artists inspired by it toward the genre. Following the various influxes of new artists into the genre, several of these artists gravitated toward specific aspects of synthwave carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide variation in styles between artists who are associated with the genre. Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited Electric Youth and Kavinsky as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014. Since 2013, synthwave has reached a broader audience from outside artists' fan bases and through popular media, thanks to games like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and the Netflix television series Stranger Things. So the answer to your question is a definite YES. Two more points on the films & music from the 2010\u2019s. First in my personal opinion is there is no longer any good new music, so in addition to Drive there have been a few 2010\u2019s we have had a bunch of films that revived all different types of older music:      just to name a few. Second Ryan Gosling is sometimes criticized for being emotionless with his acting whether he is or isn\u2019t is up to the viewer to decide. Personally I think his acting in Drive landed him the lead in this film Where he acted along side Harrison Ford whose character liked to listen to Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Great question by the way. Thank you for reading and thank you for the A2A. ",
