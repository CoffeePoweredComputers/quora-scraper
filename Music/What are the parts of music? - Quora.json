            "answer_text": "I think you mean, what are the structural parts of music? If so, let\u2019s leave lyrics out of this discussion. There are four structural parts to music: melody, harmony, rhythmic patterns and texture. Melody is a sequence of pitches (notes, frequencies of sound). Harmony is the relation between those pitches. The simplest relationship is called a pitch interval. Chords are composed of several pitch intervals. Rhythmic patterns are based on two ways to divide time, as 2 or as 3. All rhythmic patterns are combinations of those ways to divide time. Texture means what it sounds like, what instrumentation, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "The other answer is that, for many pieces, there are more than one instrument, so the sheet music exists in two forms: The Score, which contains all the music for all the instruments (and/or voices) The Parts, each of which contains only the music (notes) for one particular participant. So, for string orchestra, there would be parts for the first violin, the second violin, the viola, the cello, and the string bass. The conductor would have a Score containing all these parts on one page, such that the lines for each instrument would be stacked on top of each other, and the measures would line up. ",
