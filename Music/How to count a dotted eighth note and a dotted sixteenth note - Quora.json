            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s assume your in 4/4 time. The dotted eighth note is worth 3/4 of a beat. The attached 16th note is worth 1/4 of a beat, therefore, the entire structure = one full beat. Draw four 16th notes followed by a quarter note. Connect the first three notes with a curved line (known as a tie). Clap out the rhythm without the tie, then with the tie. The dotted 16th note is rare except at very slow tempos. It is worth 3 32nd notes and would most likely be followed by a single 32nd note. Whole structure is worth an eighth note\u20261/2 a beat Same ratio ",
