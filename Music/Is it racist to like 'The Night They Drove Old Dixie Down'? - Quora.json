            "answer_text": "The song has nothing to do with race. There's not a single word mentioning blacks or whites in the whole song. The song is about the burning of Richmond on April 2 and 3, 1865, according to the book \"Southern Lady, Yankee Spy,\" which I happen to be reading just now. Contrary to popular knowledge, it was the Confederates themselves who set the city on fire in order to deprive the Union Army of any food, ammunition, or liquor. Their foolishness in dumping several hundred barrels of hard liquor into the streets caused the fire to spread throughout the city as burning whiskey ran through the gutters. (pp. 190-191.) The reason for the conflagration is that Gen. Sherman had completed his March from Atlanta to Savannah Georgia, then north through both Carolinas to meet up with Gen. Grant outside of Petersburg Virginia. Their combined forces, along with the cavalry of Philip Sheridan, defeated Gen. Robert E Lee, causing the fall of Richmond, the Confederate capital. \"The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down\" refers to the night of April 2, when the Confederate militia set the city on fire and destroyed resources on its way out of town. By the time Gen. Grant arrived the next morning, his primary task was putting out the fires that the Confederacy had set, even as Federal soldiers were raising the flag of the United States over the Confederate capital. The song is much better than the story; but neither of them has anything to do with slavery, nor with Blacks. ",

But I think it would make a great national anthem. Singing any national anthem in public is in fact the gold standard of Virtue signaling. The ultimate \u201clook at me, I\u2019 m one of the good ones of this group!\u201d So the beginning of the fight I see on the subject national anthems breaking out this week is being led by a new group: The young millennials, wanting to send a new virtue signal and not be associated with grandma and grandpa\u2019s star spangled banner. I say \u201c It\u2019s all good.\u201d Everyone wants to belong and so we all listen to the crowd and hear \u201cblack lives matter\u201d or \u201chands up don\u2019t shoot\u201d or \u201cno justice no peace\u201d or \u201cbelieve all women\u201d or \u201c hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids have of you killed today\u201d and so repeat it in a crowd and belong. Become one with the people. The good guys. But for god\u2019s sake behaving like this has started countless wars with people who forget that it\u2019s just a slogan. Or just a song. Please remember that during the anthem debates to come. It\u2019s just a song. Play whatever song pleases the crowd at your event. Including \u201cThe night they drove old dixie down.\u201d Or what would be my choice \u201cImagine\u201d before the first pitch at the 2021 world series. ",
