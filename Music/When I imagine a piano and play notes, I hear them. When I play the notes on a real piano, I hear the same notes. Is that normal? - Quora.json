            "answer_text": "You may have what is called, \"perfect pitch\". Perfect pitch is actually pitch memory. To determine if you have it, try this experiment. After you have been away from the piano for several hours and haven't listened to any music at all, go to your piano. Choose a note but don't play it. Instead, try singing the note first - then play it. If you are able to produce the pitch vocally before you hear it, you may have perfect pitch.  The vast majority of people including professional musicians don't have perfect pitch. Instead they rely upon relative pitch. This technique involves developing the ability to relate one pitch to others. So, once one note is identified, all other pitches can be derived from this one pitch utilizing a variety of techniques. Someone with a well developed sense of relative pitch may seem to have perfect pitch once they have identified one note. But, they generally cannot recall pitches without first having a reference pitch.  Interestingly, someone with perfect pitch may not have good intonation. For example if someone with perfect pitch were to play in a group of musicians who tuned high or low to the standard pitch, they would have difficulty playing in tune with the group while most people with well developed sense of relative pitch would naturally adjust to the new reference pitch.  Another challenge for someone with perfect pitch would be to try to sight-sing music while transposing it to a different key. For most people this would present no problem. But for the person with perfect pitch, they would have to perform mental gymnastics in order to produce the pitches vocally different from what is represented on the page.  Ultimately all musicians must develop a high degree of relative pitch even if they have perfect pitch in order to facilitate understanding of the underlying structure of music. However, perfect pitch can be a great tool for transcribing music since it requires no effort to know the notes they are hearing.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean that you have an auditory hallucination and can \"hear\" the notes, then that is pretty awesome but not normal. My memory is good enough to find notes using relative pitch, but I cannot \"hear\" notes vividly except when I am dreaming. In fact, if it wasn't for dreams, I'd have trouble picturing what you mean. When dreaming, I have only a few times imagined a crazy piece of original music. One time, I even dreamt what the sheet music looked like. I woke up, ran to the piano, and played the bits I could remember and sure enough I have the POTENTIAL for absolute pitch. But I unfortunately can't do this in real life. Sometimes people that have your abilities take it for granted that other people are the same. I laugh when I read Stephen King books because it is apparent that he hears vivid voices in his head and finds it natural for his characters to hear voices as well. I don't believe that we are all the same in this respect. Likewise, some musicians have a fantastic musical memory (absolute pitch), many more have OK musical memory and good relative pitch, and on the other end of the spectrum from you are people that appear tone deaf. The middle group is what I consider normal. I still can imagine music well enough to compose it, but can't vividly hear it. Very few people have the ability that Bela Bartok had. He was apparently able to not only hear but visualize a score and then copy it onto paper the same way a normal person might copy from one physical page to another! ",
