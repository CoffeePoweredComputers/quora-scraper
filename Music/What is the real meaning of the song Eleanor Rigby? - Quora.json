            "answer_text": "Its a song about a lonely women named Eleanor Rigby. There is not hidden or subliminal message intended. Nor was it a personal accounting of any of the Beatles. Its a fictional story put to song. According to Paul McCartney: \u201cI was sitting at the piano when I thought of it. The first few bars just came to me, and I got this name in my head ... \"Daisy Hawkins picks up the rice in the church\". I don't know why. I couldn't think of much more so I put it away for a day. Then the name \"Father McCartney\" came to me, and all the lonely people. But I thought that people would think it was supposed to be about my Dad sitting knitting his socks. Dad's a happy lad. So I went through the telephone book and I got the name \"McKenzie\".\u201d McCartney said he came up with the name \"Eleanor\" from actress Eleanor Bron, who had starred with the Beatles in the film Help!. \"Rigby\" came from the name of a store in Bristol,\"Rigby & Evens Ltd, Wine & Spirit Shippers\", which he noticed while seeing his girlfriend of the time, Jane Asher, act in The Happiest Days of Your Life. He recalled in 1984, \"I just liked the name. I was looking for a name that sounded natural. 'Eleanor Rigby' sounded natural.\" It has been pointed out that the graveyard of St Peter\u2019s Church in Liverpool, where John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met at the Woolton Village garden fete in the afternoon of 6 July 1957, contains the gravestone of an individual called Eleanor Rigby. McCartney said he may have been subconsciously influenced by the name on the gravestone. In 2008, however, when a birth certificate was sold at auction of a woman named Eleanor Rigby, with seller and buyer believing it belonged to the person referenced in the song, McCartney restated publicly: \"Eleanor Rigby is a totally fictitious character that I made up.\" He added, \"If someone wants to spend money buying a document to prove a fictitious character exists, that's fine with me.\" The Eleanor Rigby from the birth certificate lived a lonely life similar to that of the woman in the song.

            "answer_text": "With \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d Paul set out to write a song about loneliness. Perhaps it was unintentional, but \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d turned out to be, in my opinion, a fairly ruthless indictment of the Church, and a not-so-subtle knock on religion. In Paul\u2019s mind, the concept of loneliness created the images of a Priest, a lonely spinster, a decaying church, death, empty pews and ignored sermons. Father McKenzie darns his socks at night and writes a \u201csermon that no one will hear.\u201d And Eleanor Rigby \u201clives in a dream\u201d and is \u201cwearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door.\u201d One of the final lines of the song is totally damning: \u201cNo one was saved.\u201d Basically, all of the Beatles were raised in homes in which religion played no part. They had all lost interest in religion by their mid-teens. Paul came from a home with an agnostic father. In \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d he reveals his presumptions about religion. ",
