            "answer_text": "They did not. When 78 RPM records where the standard recordings of the day, one side of a record could only hold about 3 or 4 minutes of music at full volume. To put something longer on the side of a 78 required closer grooves and quieter sound. So this approximate length was carried over to 45 RPM records. Radio dj shows were built around 3 minute 78 RPM records. When the top 40 format first emerged in the 1950s \u201cdouble spotting\u201d, that is playing two commercials back to back, was considered bad form. Radio stations wanted short songs so they could space out the commercials. The record companies felt that songs over three minutes were at a disadvantage for getting added to the playlist however there were exceptions, longer records were released and some longer records became hits. For instance El Paso, by Marty Robbins crossed over from Country and Western and became a big hit at 4:40. Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cLike a Rolling Stone \u201creleased in 1965 was well over six minutes, although the record company labeled it under six minutes to keep DJ\u2019s from completely freaking out. That became a big hit. There were many other hits in the 60s that were well over three minutes. By the 1970s most hits were longer than three minutes. So your question has a basis in history but contains a faulty assumption. ",

            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t actually true. Songs have averaged out at about three minutes, but there was no mutual decision by radio stations to hard cap song lengths to three minutes. The pop song as a musical form turns out to be about three minutes because whatever you want to do musically turns out to be an idea you can explore in between about three and four minutes. Occasionally songs will go longer if they have something more to say on the given idea, but the verse structure of pop songs, while varying somewhat, has never generally exceeded more than six sections (verse, bridge, interlude and chorus in various combinations) and has defined most of pop and rock music since the 1950\u2019s.
