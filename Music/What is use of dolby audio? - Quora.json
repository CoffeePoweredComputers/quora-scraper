            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a loaded question. When you say \u201cDolby audio\u201d, that encompasses a raft of technologies, both analogue and digital. At the beginning, we have Dolby\u2019s noise reduction technologies: Types A, B and C, all of which rely on the idea of increasing the amplitude of higher frequencies for better capture, then applying a filter that lowers the amplitude while preserving the quality of those frequencies, reducing tape hiss. Dolby HX Pro, where the HX Pro stands for Professional Headroom Expansion, was developed to increase the bandwidth of cassette recordings and therefore increase quality of sound reproduction. Dolby Stereo, Dolby Surround and Dolby Pro Logic are all forms of \u201cmatrix\u201d surround sound for film soundtracks, whereby a 2-channel audio track could reproduce 4 channels of audio [L, C, R, S]by decoding audio matrixed into the track. In addition, later iterations of Pro Logic allowed for simulated surround effects and extraction of bass to a dedicated subwoofer, with Pro Logic IIz simulating height channels. 6-track Dolby Stereo is a magnetic format for 70mm presentations, where the tracks were either 4-track stereo with the remaining two tracks used for low frequency effects, or LFE, or 5 track stereo with a single LFE track. Finally, we get to the digital realm. Dolby Digital aka AC-3, is a 5.1 digital audio track producing 5.1 channels of audio [L, C, R, Ls, Rs, LFE]. In film, this was encoded between the sprocket holes of a film print. Dolby added matrixed back channels to Dolby Digital and dubbed it Digital Surround EX in the early 2000s. The most recent iterations of Dolby Digital Audio are Dolby Digital 7.1, which changes the rear surround channels to discrete channels, and Dolby Atmos, which is an object-based surround sound system not tied to a specific number of speakers, but adding a more robust height element to surround sound. Aren\u2019t ya glad you asked? ",
