            "answer_text": " Billie Eilish has always been in the news for her dressing style and her personality. What separates her from the rest, and brings her attention is that she often wears clothes much larger than her actual size. In most of her public appearances, including the prestigious Grammys\u2019 Awards, she was seen wearing baggy clothes. While one should not be judged for the way they dress, celebrities are bound to e under scrutiny, no matter what they do. A lot of people criticize Billie Eilish for her \u201cnon-sexy\u201d clothing. As a response to this, during her Miami concert, Billie Eilish stripped all pieces of clothing down until only shreds covered her body. I have written about this incident here. The same post also has a short video recording from the concert.
