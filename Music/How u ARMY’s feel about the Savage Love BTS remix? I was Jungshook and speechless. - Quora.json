My only teenie tiny complaint is that I was expecting to hear more of the members more clearly than I did on my first listen (even though JK\u2019s my bias and I loved his parts lol). I also liked how they added Korean lyrics in. While I love listening to them singing in English, I\u2019d never want them to change who they are. :) ",
