            "answer_text": "Thanks for the answer request Chris, Overt narcissists are easier, like Donald Trump. Loud bragging annoying vain charming low emotional intelligence backstabbing love gossip and drama jealous bitter vindictive mocking cruel pathological lier that must win at any cost. But the most dangerous is the covert narcissist. Which most female narcissists are. It can take years to work out. They promote themselves in public as kind caring fun loving people. But its all fake. They have the same traits as the overt narc but have learnt to hide it. Apart from in front of people they trust. They turn on their chosen victim almost out of the blue, even after years of friendship. If you become too smart, catch them lying, or notice their strange behaviors. To them they know you have seen the face behind the mask they show to the world. And they no longer have any use for you. As they are scared you will expose them to others. The narcs biggest fear. So now you must be destroyed. They use slander and hate campaigns to ruin your reputation. And hopefully life. They will stop at nothing to turn everyone against you. All because if the truth got out everyone would hate them. Its like damage control. They get in first. Before the real truth is told. Smart people usually work it out though. Only people of no integrity believe one side of the story. Not matter how good narcs charm and lie. It just doesn't add up. Good people always search for the truth in every situation. And cant bare conflict and cruelness. That\u2019s where the narcs slips up.. And become obvious. Learn the red flags and the traits of a narc and you will stay safe. Make no mistake they are dangerous and want to ruin lives. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Chris for the A2A. No, it\u2019s not easy to spot people with NPD because that\u2019s not a diagnose you put by simply checking some traits in the DSM-5 or by a mere glance at someone (keep in mind most of the people, while out in society try to wear a mask and most of you have narcissistic traits in safe amounts within you). Narcissists, like any other people, have very different \u2018personalities\u2019 and a lot of different education, baggage, intelligence, etc. They\u2019re not all the same, although they do share some fundamental traits, those are not to be used to diagnose. Diagnosis is established in therapy, through several sessions where the cognitions and behaviors are analyzed by professionals. Most high functioning narcissists are, contrary to what others have said, very intelligent people. And they weaponize their intelligence to manipulate, control and persuade people into thinking they are great and you\u2019ll fall for it 100%, unless you already had some experience. If love is involved, you\u2019re pretty much doomed. Exhibitionist Narcissists (Overt) are easier to spot yes, but they\u2019re not necessarily people suffering from NPD. Vulnerable Narcissists (Covert) are harder to spot and here I can tell you why as I\u2019m being one. If the overt narcissist will sit in the center of a room, making himself known and requires everyone\u2019s attention, the covert narcissist will sit away from the crowd. Will be special and above you all by not condoning to your pathetic social activities. I\u2019ll talk to you in a condescending manner, judge you, throw you sarcastic and arrogant looks whereas an over narcissist will just give you a piece of his mind straight away. Being a self-aware narcissist with an above average intellect I can tell you that you\u2019ll have no idea what I am and who I am, you\u2019ll fall for any lie I\u2019d throw to your direction, you\u2019ll only see a funny, charming person, a lovable being. I\u2019m sneaky and I\u2019m always plotting, my mind never rests. I always watch you and analyze you so I can keep my control over you and situations. Usually narcissists are not self-aware and they do things as they come to them - an automatism. A self-aware narcissist realizes when they are mean and when they did something wrong, which is why I can continue twisting and bending the truth and facts in order to make you like me even though I hurt you. Self-awareness and intelligence on a narcissist is a deadly combo and you\u2019ll never see it coming until you\u2019re already hooked. Once you expose me and the mask falls off, you\u2019d be able to see my true self, but rest assured a narcissist will never allow you to reach that point as it will discard you as soon as you start confronting them. I hope this helps you and others understanding better this disorder and stop labeling people so easily. People can just be a**holes and not suffer from NPD, but people suffering from NPD are always a**holes. ",
