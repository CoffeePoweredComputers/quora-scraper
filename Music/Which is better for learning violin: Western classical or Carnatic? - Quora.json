            "answer_text": "Both the Western and Carnatic style of teaching Violin will help you master the instrument, but as a student of music, you should also master the subject called music and not just the instrument. Identify if you are more inclined towards Carnatic / Hindustani/ Western Music and get going on the violin. This is my story and you can have your takeaway from it. I always dreamt of playing beautiful music on the Violin. By placing it on my shoulder and dancing all around the room with it, I just loved that pose! I also looked up to a few violin tutorials online( western ones, I didn\u2019t know at that time that Carnatic and western styles existed for Violin), how to hold the violin, how to hold the bow, the four strings of the violin called G D A E strings etc, but when I attended my first violin class at a teacher in my neighborhood who teaches Carnatic music, I was very surprised to know that the way to hold the violin and bow is completely different from what I saw online. Was disappointed with that but I felt a very good connection to Carnatic music, maybe because I have heard Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni previously, in several tv shows. Western\u2019s A B C D E notation seemed quite unfamiliar to me. I continued learning Carnatic music on Violin for a few months, later I had to discontinue for some personal reasons. And by this time, when I wanted to rejoin violin classes, my fascination for Western Violin Pose had still not gone. I wanted to join for a few months of formal western violin training, but somehow, still the disconnect, because, though Western music is beautiful (also tough), it is not something which comes to me as naturally as Carnatic Music (if you are a north Indian, read Carnatic as Hindustani in this line). All our South Indian movie songs, devotional songs etc have that typical South Indian flavor and accent of music in them, which has already been embedded in me over the years. Also, I personally like Indian Music over Western Music for two reasons: Indian music has Raaga Aalapana concept, which shows the performer\u2019s mastery not only on his instrument or voice, but also on the subject called Music. It is an impromptu performance, where they do multiple permutations and combinations of Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni, by sticking to a strict set of rules for each raagam. Extreme mastery I must say. This is what you can do in a Raga Aalaapana. 2. I find the Gamakams/Ornamentation techniques in Indian Classical Music to be more light-music (movie songs etc) friendly than the ones in Western. Ornamentation techniques are used to beautify a song instead of singing or playing it plainly. We have 17 ornamentation techniques in Carnatic Music. Hope it was informative. Happy Bowing!!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "To every artist, his/her own genre is better in technique and quality of music. One cannot compare two genres as different as Carnatic and Western Classical and derive a conclusion that one is better than the other in any instrument. Each of the genres are amazing in their own spheres of music.  When it comes to the violin specifically, since violin is a European (Specifically Italian) instrument, western classical music blends in with the violin easily. But since you specifically mentioned bowing technique, bowed instruments first originated in Equestrian Central Asia (Equestrianism), some of the more prominent bowed instruments are Erhu in China, Rebab in the middle east, Byzantine lyra in the Byzantine Empire and Esraj & Ravanahatha (said to be atleast 5000 years old)  in India. The violin is a derivative from these instruments and first practiced (and very much prized ) in Europe. So in a way, the violin was born into western classical music and became a major participant in Orchestras, with the intent of adding so much more beauty to the genre.  Ravanahatha Once the violin made an entrance into the Indian subcontinent, it was swiftly adapted for Carnatic Music. The Tamil Yazh and the Ravanahatha had already been adapted, with the later being a bowed instrument. The true potential of the violin for this genre was unleashed, with the Gamaka (music) being very prominently incorporated in the instrument.  Yes, the violin is a product of western classical music, but it quickly became very prominent in the Carnatic sphere, especially since similar instruments had already been mastered. The violin is now a major instrument, previously only an accompanying instrument for a Carnatic vocalist. The saahithya (Lyrics) of Carnatic compositions can only be emphasised with a skilled bow technique. In the hands of a Carnatic master, the violin can sway the audience into believing that its almost a vocal performance. That is the beauty of the instrument.  So a conclusion such as, \"The bowing technique and all is much more refined in Western than Carnatic\" is very unfair. When it comes to your personal choice, please pick a genre you connect with and a genre that moves you. The violin is generally a difficult instrument to coax and both genres individually will be difficult to learn. But I completely disagree with your teacher about the bowing technique being better/worse in either of the cases. The bowing has to be strong for a violist, regardless of the style, without which the violin will fail you miserably. ",
