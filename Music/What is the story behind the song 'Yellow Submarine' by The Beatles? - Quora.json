            "answer_text": "The answers above are fine, so I\u2019ll just add my 2 cents on top: John and Paul liked to write a song for Ringo to sing on each album if they had time, and it had to be one that fit his unique (but limited) vocal range. Like \u201cWith a Little Help,\u201d they seemed to have come up with a good one in \u201cYellow Submarine.\u201d Ringo Said on Anthology: \u201cI don't actually know where they got the idea for it; I just felt it was a really interesting track for me to do. I'd been doing a lot of covers. At that time I did either covers or something they wrote specifically for me.\u201d Paul said in Anthology: \u201cI remember lying in bed one night, in that moment before you're falling asleep - that little twilight moment when a silly idea comes into your head - and thinking of Yellow Submarine: 'We all live in a yellow submarine...'I quite like children's things; I like children's minds and imagination. So it didn't seem uncool to me to have a pretty surreal idea that was also a children's idea. I thought also, with Ringo being so good with children - a knockabout uncle type - it might not be a bad idea for him to have a children's song, rather than a very serious song. He wasn't that keen on singing.\u201d And in his \u201cMany Years From Now\u201d Book: \u201cI was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal. I just made up a little tune in my head, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived and how there'd been a place where he had a yellow submarine. It's pretty much my song as I recall, written for Ringo in that little twilight moment. I think John helped out; the lyrics get more and more obscure as it goes on but the chorus, melody and verses are mine. There were funny little grammatical jokes we used to play. It should have been 'Everyone of us has all he needs' but Ringo turned it into 'everyone of us has all we need.' So that became the lyric. It's wrong, but it's great. We used to love that.\u201d A lot of Beatles songs don\u2019t seem to mean much of anything beyond having interesting word associations/sounds. I think this is more like that. The film came out years after the song and the Beatles didn\u2019t have much to do with it, so I don\u2019t think we can learn much from the imagery used there. I\u2019d add a couple of things to this answer as \u201ctid-bits\u201d for what they\u2019re worth. 1) When John first took LSD, and they eventually made it back to George\u2019s house, in some sources (I think even Cynthia mentions this) John talks about how he felt like George\u2019s house had been transformed into a submarine and he was the Capitan. We\u2019d have to check the date of that incident against the writing of the song to see if that might have influenced it\u2026perhaps he talked about the incident with Paul, who got the image stuck in his head. 2) It seems to be accepted that Donovan wrote the line \u201csky of blue, sea of green.\u201d (or maybe it was just the \u201csea of green\u201d part, I can\u2019t recall.) He was a friend of Paul\u2019s and they were hanging out a lot during this period. Donovan says: He played one about a yellow submarine. He said he was missing a line and would I fill it in. I left the room and returned with this: 'Sky of blue and sea of green/In our yellow submarine.' It was nothing really, but he liked it and it stayed in. ",

            "answer_text": "It was the Beatles first children\u2019s song. It was song idea from Paul wanted to write a song simply for children, again exploring song writing fora different genre and unlike most bands they could carry it off without anyone batting an eyelid. The lyrics were deliberately composed of short words, done so that children could easily learn the song like a nursery rhyme. Basically it was about a young boy listening to an old sailor\u2019s fantastical yarns about sea and finding a land of submarines and then becoming a sailor . Although Paul was aware that some people would think that there were connotations to the song title, he always maintained it wasn\u2019t about drugs as some have implied, it was simply a song for young children. The line \u201csky of blue, sea of green in our yellow submarine\u201d was contributed by Donovan as McCartney was stuck for a line or two when he played it to Donovan at Donovan\u2019s Maid vale flat. They had a habit of dropping in on each other at that time. The song perfectly suited Ringo and was the flip side to Eleanor Rigby in 1966. It was later used as the basis for the feature length psychedelic Cartoon of the same name which also used other characters from Beatles songs. ",
