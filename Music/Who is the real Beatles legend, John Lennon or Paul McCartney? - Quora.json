            "answer_text": "In terms of songwriting, both. In terms of the Beatles, all 4. The key word here is synergy. The whole was greater than the sum of the parts. Of course some fans prefer Lennon and others prefer McCartney, but that\u2019s subjective and does not negate the contributions of the other. Also, because Lennon is deceased, he tends to get a bit more recognition as a legendary figure. That almost always happens when an artist dies. If one wants to break it down, McCartney was stronger as a melodist and musically in general. Lennon was stronger lyrically and pushed lyrical boundaries. But they complimented each other perfectly and spurred each other into a healthy competition, so McCartney was quite an excellent lyricist at times and John at times was an excellent melodist. John was a bit more of the rebel, rock and roll type, Paul was a bit more of the diplomatic and versatile type. So neither was the key member. They were equally important in different ways. ",
