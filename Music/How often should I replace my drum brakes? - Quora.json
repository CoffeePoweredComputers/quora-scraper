            "answer_text": "Since I doubt that you plan to actually replace them yourself (if you could do this, you wouldn\u2019t need to ask), here\u2019s a little info. Not all cars have drum brakes. Yours may not, which would mean that you have disc brakes on all 4 wheels. The brakes should be thought of as an entire system, meaning that all your brakes should be checked at the same time. If you are following the manufacturers service recommendations, your brakes are being checked at each significant service (ie: 30, 60 and 90,000 mile intervals) and sometimes more often. In other words, don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll let you know when the brakes are getting too thin. If you haven\u2019t followed the car makers recommendations, get your brakes checked during your next service and ask for an estimate as to what percentage of brake linings remain. Brake inspections are often done at no charge and are usually done anywhere that sells brakes or tires plus many other shops. On most vehicles, brake pads and shoes last a long time. Expect to get over 60K miles on a set of brakes but the lifespan can vary greatly. Of course, things come up and you should have your brakes checked any time you hear noise, have a light come on or notice a problem with the way they function. ",

            "answer_text": "They last a long while. I replaced mine after 20 years of service (rear only) and it probably didnt need it yet. I had to go in to replace a wheel cylinder so replaced mine, but they had a few more years left. The deal with drums is you gotta adjust them. I work on cars all day and dont adjust my brakes on my vehicles when I should because my maintenance schedule is schewed and weird. Id rather just swap them if Im in there already on my personal vehicles but that isnt the best advice to non-shop managers. Adjusting drum brakes takes 10 minutes and isnt something customers request or something I necessarily want to recommend that I do because our shop is small and has a one hour shop minimum. Now, if you have a shop replace your front pads, thats the time to request rear drums get adjusted because shop minimum is already met. Whats 10 extra minutes in labor? These days front disc provides 80% of your braking power. Unless you start going through front pads super fast (once every 2 years) rears are probably fine. Even then, bad rear shocks are usually the real culprit for fast front disc wear. ",
