            "answer_text": "Can you be racist to a white person? SJW\u2019s certainly are but they mainly limit their actions to talk and at most persecute people that they choose to target in order to be able to express their hate since they get such kicks out of it as they imagine that whites and especially white males are somehow a legitimate target that you can keep kicking with impunity to express your frustrations and hate without facing the typical condemnation that usually follows for such behavior. They also insist things like \u201cyou cannot be racist towards white people\u201d and so. White people all have \u201cwhite privilege\u201d is thrown around casually as if it weren\u2019t racism. The issue isn\u2019t whether some whites are racist. They face racism too from non-white people and from white people as well. prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. \"a programme to combat racism\" synonyms: racial discrimination, racialism, racial prejudice/bigotry, xenophobia, chauvinism, bigotry, bias, intolerance; More the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.For instance there are many racist terms towards whites: Cracker / Cracka Hillbilly Redneck (Directly using the sunburnt white skin as racial slur.) more: Albino Anglo (Derogatory term used by Mexicans in Texas.) Aryan (Can be used towards racist whites who don't think they're racist.) Bak Guiy (Cantonese for \"white ghost.\u201d) Bean Dipper (White men, or any non-hispanic, who date hispanic women.) Big Nose (Term used by Asians when refering to westerners because of their larger noses) Bird Shit (Bird shit is white.) Blanco ('Blanco' is Spanish for white or blank.) Casper (Casper the friendly ghost) Caveman (Refers to the Neanderthals living in caves; used by rappers.) etc. The Racial Slur Database In addition to insults and slurs there is always many other types of discrimination against whites. You might not be welcome to an area or event with predominantly non-white attendance or inhabitants. You might be attacked because of your skin color. All the typical expressions of racism. Since we consider that we\u2019re all the same despite our skin color it is absurd to conflict that with remarks that claim white people to be especially racist or so because of their skin color. Also generalizations about white people are just as bad as generalizations about anyone else. Everyone who engages in social interaction will eventually run into racism and bad experiences. The Liberal-Left (for a lack of better term) really ought to distance themselves from the white-hating racists amidst them if they ever wish to be taken seriously again. And shouting \u201cno, you\u2019re a racist!\u201d isn\u2019t going to solve anything. Especially if you once again start your tirade about how all whites are collectively responsible for bla bla. Unless someone honestly thinks that white skin color is a race of human beings that are solely responsible for racism and that they deserve everything bad coming their way for being so evil. ",

            "answer_text": "Racist, as in deeply prejudiced against a person due to no factors beyond the color of their skin: Yes. Racist, as in perpetuating inherently unjust systems on them due to no factor beyond their skin color: Not in the US. Like a lot of \u201cisms\u201d, there\u2019s both the personal and the systemic. One can be deeply and unfairly prejudiced against every person who has a factor of a different type of person. How that affects the person in question depends on where they are in particular social classes and hierarchy and just general systems of thought. My dad experienced anti-white racism as a child in the 1940\u2019s, as he was one of the only white children in his school. He was targeted by both other children and adults for harassment and violence. However, he was not a victim of systemic racism - the majority culture in the United States was still geared towards him being the ideal. While he was lacking in a certain amount of power in his particular situation, all of the authority figures around the area were white, all of the heroes in pop culture were white, all of the presidents were white, and as he went to a Catholic school, all of the teachers were white. Everyone who was in charge of anything looked like him, and the people who looked anything like his classmates were mostly caricatures based on minstrel shows, aside from the odd black character in war movies. So, it\u2019s complicated. My father experienced racist violence (he was stabbed three times and shot twice before he was in high school), but he ultimately benefited from systemic racism that said he was better than his peers because of his white skin, not because of his intelligence and drive. His intelligence and drive helped him get noticed, but he was noticed more easily than an equally gifted black boy would have been. ",

            "answer_text": "Any person can be prejudiced against members of any group. That is, anyone can pre-judge the members of a group, using stereotypical assumptions about the characteristics of a person unknown to them based solely on the person's membership in the group. The dictionary definition of \u201cracism\u201d may be indifferent to the power status of various groups, but keep in mind that dictionaries are usually written by members of the dominant group. The term \u201cracism\u201d was born of systematic attempts to subjugate people who have ancestry from continents other than Europe. The idea being that \u201cwhites\u201d \u2014 people of European ancestry, especially northern European ancestry \u2014 are superior to all others. Members of the same group who brought the fictional concept of \u201crace\u201d into society also get to define the term \u201cracism\u201d, ignoring key elements of its history. That's convenient for whites. I know what it's like to feel hatred from blacks because I'm white. The fact is, I've always had the upper hand in those relationships because, as a white person, I've gone through life with the benefit of dominant group status. Most people pre-judge me to be intelligent, honest, and capable. My life has had painful struggles, but none of my struggles have been related to my European ancestry, unless you consider that, as research shows (see Crocker & Major, 1989), people of European ancestry in the US generally have lower self esteem than people of African ancestry, which may have put my white mother, who took her own life when I was a baby, and my white son, who overdosed on opiates at age 24, at greater risk for those outcomes. We have a perfectly good word for the pre-judging of whites, women, people with medical conditions such as obesity, the differently abled, and all other groups. That word is \u201cprejudice\u201d. The word \u201cracism\u201d would not exist without the bogus science cooked up to support the myth of European supremacy. It makes sense for dictionary publishers to account for the etymology of words as they define them, and usually they do. But in the case of the word \u201cracism\u201d, they chose to go the easier \u201cboth sides\u201d route, leaving the crucial element of power/dominance out of the definition. This may change in time. You may have heard that a thing of importance within a particular culture may come with multiple words to refer to the thing and account for different qualities of said thing. For example, The Sami, who live in the far north of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia, have at least 180 words for snow. Each unique term for snow refers to a different kind of snow \u2014 fresh snow or icy snow or packed snow (See Alison Kroulek, K-International blog, 2015). In English, we have different words for prejudice. \u201cRacism\u201d is a particular type of prejudice used in the oppression of people who are descended, at least in part, from people with long histories on continents other than Europe. The only reason to take the role of power/dominance out of the definition of racism is to obscure the responsibility of white people in maintaining racist systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can be racist to white people. To discriminate based on someone\u2019s race, or to attribute certain traits (whether it be strenghts or weaknesses) to a race, is racist. For white people, if you say that white people are racist in a blanket statement, that\u2019s racist. If you say white people need to feel guilty about what their ancestors have done or for their white privilege, that\u2019s racist. If you say that white people have privilege, that\u2019s racist. If you say white people need to shut up and listen to POCs, that\u2019s racist. If you say that white people are evil imperialists, that\u2019s racist. Though to be fair, there are so many civilisations in history that have become imperialistic regardless of the race of its peoples. It\u2019s just Europeans were the ones who beat everyone else to the punch in colonising the rest of the world. Now to answer the other question that merged into this question; \u201cWhy are there people who don't think speaking bad about whites isn't racist?\u201d In the minds of these people, these postmodernist cultural marxists, they believe that you cannot be racist to a white person. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the University of Delaware Office of Residence Life Diversity Facilitation Training. Excerpts from University of Delaware Office of Residence Life Diversity Facilitation Training - FIRE A RACIST: A racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. The term applies to all white people (i.e., people of European descent) living in the United States, regardless of class, gender, religion, culture or sexuality. By this definition, people of color cannot be racists, because as peoples within the U.S. system, they do not have the power to back up their prejudices, hostilities, or acts of discrimination. (This does not deny the existence of such prejudices, hostilities, acts of rage or discrimination.)\u201d \u2013 Page 3 So yeah, that was written and published by a University. Obviously you can see where people are coming from when they say college campuses are now Marxists indoctrination camps. Postmodernists, and cultural Marxists have attempted to hijack the term \u201cracist\u201d and redefine it in such a way that it can only apply to whites. Of course everyone else in the sane world hasn\u2019t bought into this definition. A racist is someone who thinks one race is superior to another due to some belief that one race possess traits the other one doesn\u2019t have. However, those people that believe that throwing shade at white people isn\u2019t racist, they believe that \u201cracist\u201d term that University of Delaware has published. So you might ask what is the new term these people use to define bigotry based on racial lines, and that term is \u201ccolourism\u201d. I don\u2019t think \u201ccolourism\u201d has caught on yet, but you can watch a whole video on it by Franchesca Ramsey. I\u2019m not going to link you to it because I don\u2019t want to give it more traffic than need be, but feel free to find her on MTV\u2019s Youtube Channel. ",

            "answer_text": "You need only look at a dictionary to know people can be racist against anyone. People who argue against the possibility of people being racist against whites do this by using only one of the dozen or so definitions listed in the dictionary for racism, but that is not how words work. Many words in the English language have more than one definition racism is one of those words. Certain groups in America want people to believe that institutional racism somehow deletes all other forms of racism however it does not. It\u2019s insidious and is designed to keep wide spread racism alive. Anyone who uses just a little forethought should know it is not wise to suggest one or more groups can not be racist against a group like white people in this example. Why, because you are actually encouraging people to raise their children to be racist creating a perpetual cycle of hate. Before the concentration camps the Nazis did the same thing with the Jews they encouraged racist beliefs against one group to the point they were no longer considered human and therefore not entitled to basic human rights. There are currently consequences for spewing racism against every racial group in America except whites, the only exception is hate crimes and even still it is much easier to meet the criteria of a hate crime if the victim is a minority and the suspect is white. The idea that groups can not be racist against whites is actually racist by definition and it implies that all other groups have some type of moral superiority regardless of whether that is the intent or not. Also one of the definitions of racism is prejudice so if you are being prejudice against a group you are actually meeting the definition of racist. One major problem in America is that these concepts are so insidious that teachers and professors alike are incorrectly teaching these biased concepts to young children and young adults. It\u2019s never a good idea to teach a new generation of people that it is ok to be racist against any group, history has shown this to be true time and time again but people never seem to want to learn. As a result it is not likely racism will be going away anytime soon. Another problem is people profit from the idea of institutional racism. If racism no longer becomes a major issue those people and groups who profit will become irrelevant and lose the significant power they hold in countries like America, let that sink in.

            "answer_text": "This is impossible to answer meaningfully until we agree on a shared working definion of \u201cracist\u201d, and on the geographical context where we are applying it. Some people (or some contexts) use the word to mean something like \u201chostile towards, or prejudiced against, others based just on their perceived race\u201d, or \u201csubscribing to a concept of racial superiority\u201d, in which case one could certainly be racist against white people, so the answer is \u201cyes\u201d with that definition. Other people, more recently, use the word to mean \u201csupporting an existing systematic heirarchy based on race\u201d. In this usage, typically, it is by definition not possible to be racist against whatever the locally more powerful race happens to be. In the US, for example, that would be whites. Elsewhere, it can differ. So in this usage, the answer is \u201cyes, but only in contexts where whites do not dominate the local society\u201d. But the answer could be \u201cno\u201d when using the second definition and within a white-dominated society. (It\u2019s hard not to at least briefly note here that the concept of \u201crace\u201d is complex in itself and likewise very semantically confused by differing definitions) Back to \u201cracist\u201d. Either usage can be internally consistent, and can make sense. Neither usage is more objectively \u201ccorrect\u201d. The second usage is more recent, and is more \u201cprescriptive\u201d (how somebody asserts the word SHOULD be used), the former is more descriptive (how most people - across the whole population of English speaker - actually use it today). We could leave this as an answer - that it depends on which definition you are using and potentially on the geographical location. But some people are insisting politically that they get to completely control the one and only \u201ccorrect\u201d meaning of the word, which from now on can have only that one second meaning worldwide. They not rarely like to \u201ccorrect\u201d anybody using the word in any other usage. Many find this approach both arrogant and unconvincing. The only way to have a meaningful conversation across political differences is to be explicit and a bit more humble about the working definitions, to find some common agreement as to what one means by \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cracism\u201d IN THE PRESENT CONVERSATION, setting aside which is \u201cright definition\u201d in any absolute sense, in favor of discussing the concepts rather than arguing about the labels. I often use \u201cracially biased\u201d or \u201cracially prejudiced\u201d as a race-neutral term which both sides understand more or less similarly. If one is talking about systematic power differences, then I might use \u201csystematic racism\u201d, which can be explained to both sides. Just using the unqualified terms \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cracism\u201d is a sure way to cause people to unwittingly talk past each other, or provoke a distracting and dysfunctional fight about control of language.

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can be part of a culture which constructs a racial epistemology that categorizes unique individuals into the arbitrary category of \u201cwhite\" and declares that nearly all, if not all, people of this category have common characteristics essential to their biological nature, which might or might not be mutable. That is racism. The prejudice + power/privilege model of racism has very little utility to most individuals, and is often used as a means to reconstruct rather than abolish the dominant racial epistemology. If, for example - hypothetically, a bunch of PoC started beating up white people in their neighborhood or school because they held a particular racial epistemology which lead them to the belief that white people are inherently and biologically predisposed to being oppressive and need to be tamed into becoming \u201chuman beings\" through violence, then yes that is racism. That is the case regardless of this group not having power beyond their locality and collectivity in the greater society. When talking about structural racism the prejudice + power model makes sense. When talking about the interactions between localized collectivities and individualities it only makes sense in so much as structural racism has an influence on these collectivities and individualities, which is not some constant, but rather varies in degree. Probabilistically it is less likely that PoC are racist to white people though, and when they are --there are fewer extant structures to act on their racism. That is why racism from white people is treated more seriously. But as we progress further toward structural equality (in terms of wealth, positions of power, etc) we will likely treat racism from any person equally seriously. Who does what when, depends on their individual views on said structural equality between so-called races. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. However, because of the position of white people in American society (significant majority with long-standing economic, cultural and political power), specifically, racism against white people doesn\u2019t have the same kind of negative effects on white people that racism by white people has on non-white minorities. But it does exist, by definition: If someone hates, or looks down on white people, solely because they are white \u2014 that\u2019s racism against white people \u2014 by definition. And, like all racism - it\u2019s simply in error. People are individuals - regardless of the melanin content of their skin - or, in the case of some of us \u2014 the lack thereof. That said, racism against white people seems less prevalent than racism by white people \u2014 which usually seems to be the case, in most societies: the people who are racist, or bigoted in other ways (against members of certain religions, or against immigrants from certain countries, etc.) - seem to almost always come from people in the powerful majority who have succumbed to dysfunctional thinking. You do find racism or other bigotry directed against the powerful majority - but it seems less common - presumably because minorities have more direct experience with a wider variety of people, and don\u2019t make the mistake of negative generalization that is required for bigotry as much, or as often.

If I don't kill a Boer tonight, an Indian will do | South Africa Today - Media Commission http://www.whitegenocidesa.com/mission/ By \"genocide\" we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group\u2026. Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and theeconomic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.\u201d 1991 there were 5.6 Million Whites in South Africa. Today we are less than 4.3 Million! We have been placed on level 6 of a possible 8, by Genocide Watch, an International organization that monitors, not only the number of people that are being brutally murdered in Race driven killings, but the political and socio-economic environment in which these people find themselves. These first 6 stages are (there are now 10 stages, someone verneeked us): 1. CLASSIFICATION Referring to people or groups of people as \u201cUs\u201d and \u201cThem\u201d, according to race, ethnicity, religion or nationality. We are referred to by the black population of South Africa, by several names that include \u201cBoer\u201d, \u201cWhitey\u201d, \u201ciBhunu\u201d, Settlers,Colonialists etc. 2. SYMBOLIZATION Giving names or symbols to the classifications \u2013 in our case referring to us as \u201cBoers\u201d or \u201cWhiteys\u201d. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide, unless they leadto the next stage, dehumanization. \u2026which, in our case, it has! Songs are sung about \u201cKilling the Boer\u201d. A particular song called \u201cDubula iBhunu\u201d, meaning \u201cKill/shoot the Boer\u201d, is even sung by our current State President at huge public gatherings to the great pleasure of thousands of his followers, despite our Supreme Court ruling that this song constitutes Hate Speech! You can find proof of this by viewing the following link \u2026  3. DEHUMANIZATION One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. When faced with what is being done to our people, this revulsion clearly doesn\u2019t exist anymore! Babies are being shot at point blank range! Elderly women are being raped and tortured by burning them with clothing irons and shoving anything from broomsticks to smashed bottles into their vaginas! People are being hacked to death with pangas, their heads smashed with bricks and stones, their throats slit with blunt knives\u2026 There is NO end to the horrendous brutality with which White South Africans are being murdered!!! If you doubt this, simply type the words \u201cBoer Genocide\u201d in Google!! 4. ORGANIZATION Genocide is always organized, usually by the state, though sometimes informally or by terrorist groups. Special army units or militias are often trained and armed. Plans are made for genocidal killings. In South Africa, the Government is simply turning a blind eye to this and calling it \u201cNormal Crime\u201d at worst! These murders are by no means random nor are they disorganized! The killers/murderers always work in groups \u2013 mostly 4-5 . They steal very little and what they do take is considered \u201cloot\u201d or \u201creward\u201d for a job well done. In many cases they arrive on foot and steal a vehicle as a means of getting away. These vehicles are then simply discarded along the way and often burnt. The process of \u201corganizing\u201d a complete WIPEOUT of the Boer people was very well thought through. *Firstly the South African Government ordered that firearm owners should surrender all their firearms though a hugely unconstitutional and completely illegal campaign. Most of the law abiding citizens complied for fear of prosecution. These weapons were to be destroyed, but there is NO evidence of this ever having been done. To make matters worse, over 20 000 weapons have gone \u201cmissing\u201d from the Police Force\u2019s arsenal, with no reports as to what happened to these guns and in addition nobody was ever prosecuted for negligence regarding the disappearance of these firearms! *Secondly, all the Commandos (volunteers with army training operating under strict governance of our Defense Force) that used to keep our farming communities safe, were disbanded by our current Government, thus leaving our Farmers defenseless against these attacks. Despite promises from the Government that police officials and Defense Force units will replace the Commandos, nothing has transpired to date! *Thirdly, much is being made by the SA Government of \u201credistributing\u201d farmland. They have created the impression that most of our arid land is still in the hands of the \u201cBoers\u201d and that they are bluntly refusing to sell land to the Government who will in turn distribute this land to Black people to farm on. This is a lie, as most of the land in South Africa already belongs to the Government and up till now, no audit has been done to establish how much agricultural land is owned by the black people and how much land is being registered in the names of Foreign owners. Some of these farms previously developed by white farmers, have been given to Black communities to farm on, but without significant success. These farms have become barren, costing thousands of people their jobs and livelihood and seriously threatening our food supply in SA. All of these factors are creating an environment where the hatred for the Boer is being aggravated and these farmers are considered the enemy of the \u201cPeople\u201d \u2026and our leaders then singing songs about killing or shooting the \u201cBoer\u201d, is certainly NOT helping! 5. POLARIZATION Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws are passed with racial criteria that further oppresses the already marginalized group \u2026in this case White South Africans. South Africa is currently the only country in the WORLD that has laws in place to \u201cProtect\u201d a 50 Million Majority against a 4.3 Million Minority! The most obvious ones being: *Affirmative Action (AA) \u2013 in terms of which businesses are forced to employ workers in accordance to the percentage of the population in the country \u2013 thus meaning that 92% of the work force HAS to be black whether they have the necessary qualifications or not! *Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) \u2013 This law forces businesses with a certain turnover P/A to give 40% of their shares to a Black Business Partner. Businesses are audited and prosecuted if they are not BEE compliant. Since capability and skills have left the Government sector at the time when the white employees who were dismissed, the Government had to contract consultants to fulfill the duties of those qualified and competent white people who were dismissed. Once more, the Government is now compelled by law to only award ALL Government contracts to those private companies who are in possession of a BBBEE-certificate.This certificate is issued by the Government on completion of a thorough investigation by the Government to confirm that a private company has sufficient Black shareholders and employees ON ALL levels of their work force. *Quota System \u2013 All Sport Unions are forced to apply a quota system when choosing players for Provincial and National teams and the percentages have to again be representative of the population, thus leaving capable sportsmen and \u2013women with no way to participate unless they are black. In practice, this means that sportsmen and \u2013woman are elected to represent their province/country on the basis of the colour of their skin and not on merit at all. ***All of this whilst our Highly Praised Constitution states VERY clearly that: Section 9: The right to equality before the law and freedom from discrimination.Prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. Polarizing Propaganda is openly preached from public stages at political gatherings and white people are being called \u201cThieves and Murderers\u201d to the delight of cheering crowds. Due to large scale corruption, the current Government is hardly able to deliver any of the promised services to the poorest of the poor, but instead of owning up to the fact that BILLIONS are lost or stolen from our annual budget, white people are simply blamed for the horrendous conditions in which more than 25% of the population is currently living. This is furthering the utter hatred behind the Genocide of the White South Africans! 6. PREPARATION Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity. Death lists are drawn up. Members of victim groups are forced to wear identifying symbols. They are often segregated into ghettoes, forced into concentration camps, or confined to a famine-struck region and starved. We have now entered this phase in South Africa. We need not wear symbols as we are identified simply because we are White! In less than 10 years, more than 600 000 White people have ended up in Squatter Camps (ghettos) mostly because they have been forced to resign due to the Affirmative Action Legislation (i.e. due to the colour of their skin). These people live in horrifying circumstances with absolutely NO hope of receiving any help from the Government to acquire shelter and food! There are only 2 levels left before White South Africans, the ones that are left, will literally have to \u201crun for their lives\u201d! More than 1 Million White South Africans have left the country already \u2013 some after experiencing crime first hand. Some because their very own family members have been murdered and some to find employment in countries where their skin colour will NOT be a disqualification. 7. EXTERMINATION Extermination begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called \"genocide.\" It is \"extermination\" to the killers, because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to execute the killing. The frightening truth is that, although this is seen as the second last level of Genocide and we have NOT been placed here yet, we are already experiencing a level of extermination that the world simply seems to ignore! In 1994 there were more than 100 000 commercial farmers in South Africa. Today, there are only 29 000. More than 4 000 of these farmers have been murdered!!! Many of our farmers sold their land out of fear of these attacks and many more have been forced to sell their land to the Government for their \u201cLand Redistribution\u201d plan. Our Farmers are not the only targets though! Thousands of White people are murdered in Cities and Towns. More often than not, the elderly are the victims of these Hate-crimes and the brutality, with which these people are being killed, is utterly shocking! You can read the following link regarding some of the more recent incidents\u2026 8. DENIAL is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. There they remain with impunity, like Pol Pot or Idi Amin, unless they are captured and a tribunal is established to try them. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. There the evidence can be heard, and the perpetrators punished. Tribunals like the Yugoslav or Rwanda Tribunals, or an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or an International Criminal Court may not deter the worst genocidal killers. But with the political will to arrest and prosecute them, some may be brought to justice. http://www.genocidewatch.org/    White Students Barricade Themselves in Classroom as Hundreds of Black Activists Demand, \u2018Get out or We Will Kill You\u2019 Deep lies: Untitled Document Project Hammer: https://blikskottel.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/project-hammer-were-sas-whites-sold-out/ Communist Struggle Songs (about murdering whites), are being revived by White Communists like Don Clarke and Dan of \"The Liberation Project\", which has a following on Facebook.

We don\u2019t worry about racism towards white people in this country too much because, generally speaking, white people don\u2019t suffer as a result of other people\u2019s racism. Nobody is marching in the street because police target and kill white people more than they should. Nobody\u2019s stopping white people on the street, demanding to see their papers, and hauling them away to a detention center if they can\u2019t prove they\u2019re not immigrants. Being the victim of racism, sexism, or some other ism is not a desirable state of affairs for the affected individual. If you feel envious of them for their victim status, don\u2019t. They\u2019d much rather be in your shoes. Instead of trying to deflect the charge of racism which, I suspect, has been leveled against you, try showing a little respect and consideration for people, who are, through no fault of their own, different from you and suffering as a result of the endemic prejudice in our society.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the definition of \u201cracist\u201d. Whether or not reverse racism exists has been hotly debated, but I think that\u2019s because there are two definitions of racism that have been circulating on the internet. One is racial prejudice, and the other is racial prejudice backed by systematic prejudice. I think that anyone can hold racial prejudices, so if you define racism this way, then yes, you can be racist to a white person. The other meaning of racism is applicable in societies where prejudice or negative bias exists against people of color, or, in very few cases, against white people. If you define racism this way, then racism towards white people in America isn\u2019t real, because white people in America don\u2019t have to deal with job discriminations based on race or the added stigma of being a different race; white people have the leg up in most situations because of their race. Also , I think that throwing the word racist around without clarifying the way the other person defines can lead to a lot of arguments. ",

I know real racism when I see it. Now, to answer your question, it does, but it isn\u2019t as common as racism against people of color. There is more distrust of white people by people of color because they have had negative experiences with whites people who were racist against them. Whites have long been the majority and the majority just doesn\u2019t get to play the victim with any legitimacy. I hear a lot of bitching about reverse discrimination, but I haven\u2019t experienced it all that much. It mostly comes from people who are members of black separatist groups. There are several listed by the SPLC as hate groups and they\u2019re just as odious and obnoxious as the Klan. Most people of color, whether they be African Americans, Latino, API or Native Americans, are decent people who have a whole lot more in common with every race than they do differences. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Racism is about personal bias. There's something called code switching, which is when people act differently around those that are in the same groups as them than they do when they are around people that might label them \u201cother.\u201d Everyone does this. You probably do this, switching between your job and your excursions with your friends. I hear a lot of people make jokes about their \u201ccustomer service voice.\u201d That right there is a prime code switching example. I, personally, assume that all White people are at least a little racist, and so far, very few White people I have met acknowledge or try to change the behavior that they were programmed with. So I am very rarely ever truly myself with any White people. I am being a sanitized and edited version of myself. I quite literally White wash myself for them. I have to lie, and keep secrets, and pretend and act with White people because there are times that I rather keep the peace than make waves by trying to correct people. I view White women close to my age as *generally* methods of casual sex and I view White men close to my age as children. Most men I meet, regardless of age, have very frail egos. White men however, their egos collapse as soon as you prove their bigotry. Its childish and I'm shocked that they arent still in grade school when we talk about racial issues. Then again, thats what racial otherism does, it robs the proverbial \u201cother\u201d of their innocence as infants and it grants innocence, even when it is undue, to those in the in-group. ",

If they don't have blacks to be racist against, or Indians, or Chinese, or Japanese, or Australian Aborigines, or Arabs, they turn against other whites. A WASP (white, anglo-saxon, protestant) turns against Italians, against Spaniards, against Jews, against Latinos, against Greeks, against Poles etc. If the white has blue eyes and blond hair, he turns against all other whites who don't have blue eyes and blond hair. The worst racist is the white, among the whites the worst racists are the northern Europeans, among the northern Europeans the British (they are racists against Welsh, Irish, Scottish) and their descendants: American WASP, Australian WASPs, African WASPs (remember the apartheid).By the way: I'm white, my parents were Europeans. I\u2019m Brazilian, and I know what I\u2019m talking about. Note: I am surprised by so many replies to my answer. The question had been unanswered for a long time, and as soon as I answered it, so many experts in racism appeared to tell me that I am wrong, that I do not know what I am talking about, etc. etc. etc. I am deeply grateful to all of you who, by disagreeing with me, helped me to think better. You all deserve to know what Darwin said about his work: \u201cFalse facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened \u201d It is in Darwin\u2019s book \u201cThe Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex\u201d ",

The only thing is that this form of racism has become quite fashionable including among the self loathing useful idiots who seem to relish in the notion of lecturing everyone on the evils of white america and that Whites are somehow more privileged than any other race under the sun. Then there's clusterfuck known as Affirmative Action which essentially allows employers and educators the right to hire or accept minorities into jobs or educational establishments on the basis of their race without regards to qualification or merit. Individuals should hired on the basis of their skill level and work ethic not on the basis of Race, Religion, or Sex. Racism is universial and is little more than a collectivist ideology which plays right into the hands of Statism thus preventing us as individuals from uniting as one to slain this cursed beast \u2014 the government.

            "answer_text": "Racism is a belief, that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races. So, I\u2019m sure there are some Black people who think like that, there are Black supremacists. Racism can also be defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. This one is bit trickier, do Black people who hate White people hate them just because they\u2019re White or because of centuries of oppression? That wouldn\u2019t be racism, it would be them feeling prejudiced against White people because of all the years of oppression. Do these Black people think they\u2019re superior to White people? I mean, you could take a dog, and feed it every day but if you cage it up and beat it right along with feeding it, eventually that dog will bite you. I think what many White people mistake for racism on Black people\u2019s part is an inherent distrust that White people, as a whole have earned. They tortured, mentally and physically this group, experimented on them, deprived them of every human right and dignity imaginable and you expect them not to be prejudiced against you in some capacity?! Ridiculous. Black people just got the right the vote in the 1960s! Of course they harbor distrust but I don\u2019t think that disdain equates to racism, it\u2019s much more than that. It really depends on how you define racism and there are many ways to define it. Of course, in regards to systematic racism, which is the worst form of it, Black people aren\u2019t able to do much to White people. I mean calling a White person a cracker isn\u2019t as bad as oppressing a group of people. ",

If you look up the definition in the dictionary, nowhere do you see any mention of hierarchy, power structures, or wealth factors. These things may come into play in racism, but are not racism itself. If you describe an action with the white person as the racist and the minority as the victim, and the statement shows racism, flip the scenario where the white person is the victim and the minority is the victimizer, then guess what? If it still shows an action based on color of skin, it\u2019s still racist. Using a racial slur is racist. Excluding someone because of skin color is racist. \u201cYou crackers are the devil\u201d is as racist as \u201cyou n****rs are lazy.\u201d And there is one saying that is racist as hell. When you hear it, you can be assured that the person uttering it is racist. \u201cCheck your white privilege.\u201d Everybody needs to step back and take a long look at how we are doing things. If you make a statement that someone else of a different shade has it better than you because of the color of skin, you\u2019ve made a racist statement.

            "answer_text": "I think that the term \u201cracist\u201d is a sub category of the human propensity to treat individual people as if they are categories, not individuals, and who therefore can be viewed as somehow less human - as \u201cthe other\u201d Racism implies assumed membership in a category of humanity which does not, by definition, share the same basic emotions, thinking style or capacity for relationship. as the group which is in power at that point. It\u2019s a way of copping out of our duty to each other as human beings. Racism is one major aspect of this propensity to treat people as categories, and is so dominant because skin colour is easily identifiable. But being dehumanized happens to other groups of humans also - people who are obese, who are mentally or intellectually disabled, who are old - or young, who have a physical disability, who are homeless street people. All these groups are, or have been, seen as sub human - as not as human as the dominant group, So whenever someone is am member of a vulnerable, easily identifiable category dehumanization - racist behaviour - is likely. I was once on a tour of Shanghai Harbour on a boat filled with Chinese people. My cousin and I were the only whites. A tour group of Chinese people were fascinated with us. They took our pictures with them as if we were zoo animals, poked us and pushed us, and asked us questions in Mandarin, laughing loudly when we replied in English. It got so weird that I had to ask a Chinese Canadian woman we were travelling with to speak to them. She ripped of a wide strip in Mandarin and the crowd disappeared; she then apologised saying they were country people on a tour of Shanghai and had likely never seek a white person before. We were a category, not individuals to them. I think racism is a consequence of institutionalized ignorance ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it exists. Racism involves the belief that one race is superior/inferior to others. Some non-white people express this belief about white people openly and often. There have been hate crimes committed against white people. They may be fewer but they do happen. And some consider it racism when employers or educational institutions give preferences to minorities, holding white people and not-white people to different standards. If a white person is turned down for a job or doesn't get into a school because others were given preference, it's easy to argue that they have been affected adversely by racism. It seems like some people feel that the way to overcome racism against themselves is to act racist toward others. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends how you\u2019re using the term. In the everyday sense, yes, you obviously can. In sociology and other social sciences racism refers to an ideology \u201cin which the presumed biological or cultural superiority of one or more racial groups is used to justify or prescribe the inferior treatment or social position of other racial groups\u201d. In other words, it refers to systemic, cultural, or societal racism, and to words and actions which support such institutions. Racism in the everyday sense, i.e. individual prejudice against particular ethnic groups, is referred to as racial prejudice. This is really the root of this argument. Some smart-arse sociology student says \u201cWell, technically you can\u2019t be racist to white people in a white-supremacist society, so\u2026\u201d and people without a background in sociology don\u2019t realise they are using an academic definition in a non-academic setting and lose their damn minds because \u201cthat person just said you can\u2019t be racist to white people!\u201d. On the one hand, it\u2019s just poor communication- know your audience, and don\u2019t use academic definitions when speaking to people without a background in the relevant discipline. It\u2019s unnecessarily confusing. And on the other hand, un-knot your damn panties and stop looking for an excuse to pretend that white people are being victimised. ",

            "answer_text": "Questions like these are so stupid. It mostly links to sadly mostly whites in America that want to see things get changed by having another race be a victim always. People refuse to stop talking about race, the first step to end racism is to stop talking about it. Countries like the US have done so much AGAINST racism it\u2019s unbelievable to me that people still think that something like reparations should be had. America was the first major white majority country to END racism. TO END IT. Racism is still huge in the world in countries in the Middle East and even places like India, I don\u2019t only mean racism as social racism but there is literally still slavery there, now instead of people complaining about that it\u2019s, one bad cop killed a man by putting his knee of his neck and even though he\u2019s been fired and will be persecuted, let\u2019s make it into a race thing. It\u2019s sad today that certain people TRY to make things into identity politics. Where are the reparations for white peoples that hung in the US alongside blacks for trying to free them? Or whites in the civil war? Thousands upon thousands of white Americans died trying to end slavery in their own country. Hundreds of thousands of whites (and obviously yes blacks as well) have died in foreign countries to end slavery. Once you stop using identity politics and using the words African America and white in the same sentence racism will end. To raise a generation and quite simply put to them that there are black people and white people and that they together are just people together or individually one person ends racism. Instead of giving people special titles like African American man while white men are only called white men we should give everyone the same title. When you give someone a special name they will be treated differently from other people and that may be for the bad. The saddest part is that most people really are not racist nor care about the color of someone\u2019s skin, yet in America we have politicians screaming it and when one bad apple occurs then a whole race is apparently guilty.

Chinese like Chinese, Indian like Indian, Japanese prefer Japanese, black prefer black & white prefer white. It's how nature wants it. It's how nature maintains diversity because diversity makes a species stronger. A weakness in one race will be a strength in another meaning if a virus attacked, some races would be more resilient and ensure human survival. So the we are all the same thing is rubbish, we are all different. All races are different and that is how its meant to be. A big melting pot where we are one big monoculture, all pretty much the same is not a good idea. Racism against whites is building up I think. Few are left in SA most have fled. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, but racist black people have attempted to alter the definition of racism to \u201cprejudice + power\" in order to justify their open racism towards white people. Racism is prejudice of a group of people based on their race full stop. The addition of power or oppression in the attempted amendment of the definition further adds a level of victim mentality. While in the past within the US and other western nations did have a racial power imbalance that is no longer the case, and in some instances blacks are in positions of power represented in greater numbers than their percentage of the population. This attempted revision of the definition also fails to account for black majority nations where most of not all of the power is held by blacks. Racism, no matter if it is whites toward blacks or blacks towards whites is ignorant and wrong. Attempting to alter definitions of words to soften the impact on your own biases to make you feel better about your prejudices doesn't justify your behavior. ",

So, for example, if a black person is a boss and a white person is an employee, it is possible for a black person to discriminate against a white person. However, it is still not the same as the reverse, because the culture at large is still dominated by white people, so that white employee can easily get another job, one with a white boss. That is far more difficult for a black employee with a racist white boss, especially if they live in a very white, very conservative, very racist town. ",

Every time I read some article in the western media about the desirability of \u201cinclusion\u201d and people being prosecuted for the merest perceived slight against someone of a different ethnic group in London I can\u2019t help reflect on the fast tracks available for Chinese people in Singapore, where other races are sidelined, especially Caucasian. Or how about the dual pricing schemes here in Thailand, where Thais are charged one dollar entrance to attractions, while westerners pay eight dollars for the same thing? That\u2019s not just cheating, it\u2019s official policy. Or go to Japan where Caucasians are looked down upon as inferior. Reality is that racism is rampant in the world everywhere outside the liberal western nations. Ok, some races are more stigmatized than others, but don\u2019t assume Caucasian people are somehow immune! The normal thing is for minority races to be singled out. In the West, this often means black people. Outside the west, Caucasians are often also in the minority. ",

If racism is judging people on the basis of their race. Then also yes. This is the most commonly used definition. If racism is a system that oppresses people on the basis of their race. Then still yes. This \u201chatred + power\u201d definition is pretty new and not widely accepted. It\u2019s mostly used by racists, predominantly white racists ironically enough, to excuse hatred of other white people in western countries. But if you leave the west than there are a lot of countries without a white majority, and some of them do have systemic oppression of white people. Like Zimbabwe. Where white farmers had their land seized and redistributed to black political cronies. ",

Anyone is capable of racism, regardless of color, and people who aren't generally racist sometimes fall into the trap of assuming the worst of people based on race as well. It's an unfortunate fact of human nature. Yes, racism exists against white people, if only in the assumption that a white person will automatically dislike a person of another race. ",

Sometimes people are blamed for doing things they weren't alive to even do. ",

The quick answer is \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible to be racist against white people\u201d. The longer answer is that the effect of racial prejudice varies greatly on the social and political power of the respective parties. There are times when the power belongs to whites, and also cases where the power belongs to blacks. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite recent attempts to redefine racism in a way to exclude people in power from being victims of racism (namely, White people), the most common understanding is that racism is the belief that one or more racial groups are superior to one or more racial groups, without consideration to the specific race. The issue is made complicated because of the fallacy of argument by definition. Historically, dictionaries were prescriptive and defined exactly the right definition. However the way people understand words is fluid over time and region, and therefore dictionaries have become more descriptive. By creating a new definition of racism prescriptively, a new definition can be associated with a word, and therefore the fallacy of argumentation by definition comes into play again. Incorporating a definition that excludes people in power as possible was a prescriptive act by specific individuals, in order to subvert public understanding of racism. Redefining racism is a manipulative, political act that is contrary to descriptive understanding. ",

I have seen many racist actions against Whites as well as other colors of the spectrum. Many years ago, a friend of Indian origin was dating a White man and her parents told her in crystal clear terms that their children are not to associate themselves so closely with people outside of the Indian race. It was totally about race. ",
