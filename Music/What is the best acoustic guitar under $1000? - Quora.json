            "answer_text": "The best guitar is the guitar that gives you the sound and feeling you're looking for.  There's no such thing as the \"best acoustic guitar\" -- it all depends on what you want.  Gibson, Martin, Taylor, and other brands make great guitars, some of which you can buy (new or used) for less than $1,000.  But they all feel, sound, and play differently, and other factors also affect the sound and playability: what kind of wood is used, the type of strings you play on, how the guitar is set up, etc. I suggest visiting a good music store and trying out a bunch of different guitars.  Figure out what kind of sound you like and look for a guitar that fits.  You might find that you can buy it new for under $1,000, or you might have to buy used.  Either way, you should choose an instrument that sounds and feels great to you. ",
