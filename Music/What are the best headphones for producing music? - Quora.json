            "answer_text": "I realize that there will be a number of detractors from my position on this and I'm ok with that. I simply defy any of them to disagree with my logic on it. When you're producing music, your monitors serve only two real purposes: Auditioning timbres, patches, and samples for your synths and kitsHearing the highest fidelity presentation of how a particular edit, configuration, effects chain, or automation sequence sound when dropped into the mix. In other words, \u201cHow will this sound when listened to on a flat reference system?\u201d and then later, when mastering, \u201cHow will this sound when played through various reference system standards and does it still convey the same musical message on each?\u201dIn order to answer these questions, you really must get back to fidelity\u2026or, literally, faithfulness. Faithfulness to what should then be the next question. Today, with so much \u201cin the box\" production, we often forget that music is first and foremost something that we experience live. For rock music, the studio recording should be the ideal representation of a pristine stage or arena, for classical it would be an acoustically perfect hall, and for most electronic music it would be a well isolated and dampened club or wide open festival field. So, when we're producing and mastering, regardless of how or where the sounds were created, and even if they ever were recorded after traveling through actual physical air or they simply have remained in the digital domain through to and after the bounce, we're trying to recreate one of those experiences for the listener. Indeed, with electronic dance music, the club might be the main venue where the music is experienced, so we're actually mastering for the venue that we're trying to recreate. (It would be as if we're recording classical music in a hall with the intention of reproducing that same sound in a different hall by only playing the recording. The whole point here is that we're simulating an environment that encapsulates the following simple acoustic model: Sound source-> open air -> ears / semi-reflective surfaces <-> open air In essence, we're recreating a system where sound necessarily passes through the air at least twice (since it can't all directly be absorbed by the eardrum in the first flight)\u2026 and likely many more times before it becomes imperceptible. Now, I'm not interested here in the phenomenon of reverb though I am saying that it's essentially going to exist in a decent finished track. Instead, what I'm trying to hammer home is that we are always reproducing a system where the source and the ear are separated by a significant span of space filled with this fluid known as air. That should be perfectly obvious to anyone who knows anything about sound. That is, unless you're a marine animal, your hearing involves detecting energy that is in the form of vibrating and which has traversed air. So, maybe you're beginning to understand my point: when you produce with open air monitors, you're closely (if not, as is the case with electronic dance music, precisely) recreating the system that the listener will be referencing. However, when you're using headphones, you're decidedly not doing this because none of the environments you're trying to recreate the experience of involves the listener's ear being millimeters from the sound source. So, the simple answer to this question is: none. Given that, let's assume that near field monitors with an optional subwoofer with pedal control aren't possible for you in your studio because of neighbors or cost or whatever (though adequate and flat powered monitors can be had for $100 or less these days). In that case, there's really only one pair to recommend. Go into any professional studio and look for the cans (headphones) that are plugged into active equipment. In the vocal booth, next to the mixing desk, into the phones jack on one or two synthesizers and more often than not you'll find these:  These are the Sony MDR-7506 studio headphones. They've been around for, wait for it, two decades with no changes to the original design. There's a damned good reason that they've been around for so long and used by so many: they're the industry standard - because - they're IDEAL. They balance comfort, reference flat response (which, by the way, sounds good as it should), loudness, and durability with price. You can pick up a pair new for $75 or less and be guaranteed of two things: They have been used to mix and master more tracks that you've heard than any other set of cansYou'll have everything that you now need to do headphone - level quality mixing professionally for hours on end for years.Some people will tell you that their cans sound better which is entirely possible. But guess what? While these are more than adequate for audiophile listening, the point isn't to have cans that sound good, it's to have cans that sound the same as your mix will sound to someone else also listening to a flat reference system. If your mix doesn't sound good, then they are doing their job. Improve your song until they do sound good. That's when you'll know your track is going to be optimized for, at a bare minimum (provided you've left enough overhead) mastering. If you master it yourself, you'll know that it's ready for the widest variety of speakers on which it'll sound as good as it can. So, your answer is: NoneIf not 1, then the Sony MDR - 7506.Now, Make music. Do it with love, and vice versa. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "With all matters of audio preference (and in this case, as it relates to a creative process), you are going to get a variety of responses. No one is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 ultimately you create your own preferences based on tons of experimentation and bad mixes. I think it\u2019s interesting to note that you said \u201cfor producing music\u201d, which encompasses both creative (musical composition, building the track) and more analytical (mixing/mastering) processes. IMO, when you are composing and building a track, it\u2019s crucial to stay inspired and excited about the music you are creating. Personally, a headphone that is more \u201chyped\u201d (i.e. accentuates the bass and high frequencies) keeps me engaged. The Audio Techinca ATH-M50 and Senheisser HD 280 are excellent, affordable choices here. For mixing/mastering, accuracy and neutrality is the key. Switch to an open-back pair of headphones \u2014 this mimics a loudspeaker experience, as the sound is tempered by the environment around you (newsflash: sound isn\u2019t meant to be confined to tiny cavities around your ear).  You\u2019ll immediately notice less congestion (and subsequently) and less bass. Your mix may sound terrible. This is a good thing, because the headphones are telling the truth \u2014 it\u2019s time to dial in your sounds, relative levels, and frequencies. For this application, I love the AKG Q701 (and any AKG \u201cK\u201d series headphone). Much like the Yamaha NS-10 monitors (which are famed for making mixes sound terrible, forcing the mix engineer to really work for it), they don\u2019t hype any frequencies, and make you hear things as they actually are. The Yamaha NS10 Story This isn\u2019t a linear process \u2014 you may be constantly switching between your \u201chype\u201d headphones and your \u201creferences\u201d headphones as you dial in your mix \u2014 you should even check your mix on a pair of white apple earbuds, as that\u2019s what most of your audience will be listening with. tl;dr: each headphone tells a different sonic story, use each to your advantage depending on what stage of the process you are in.
