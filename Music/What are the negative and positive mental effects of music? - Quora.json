            "answer_text": "Music simply enhances our emotion right at the moment. When your mood is not good.. during that time if you listen to a sad song with heart touching lyrics then you will end up in crying literally.When your mood is very good.. if you switch on to a peppy music that will enhance your energy and give you a very refreshing feel.For me, Positive effect : Music will make me go crazy sometimes and will give me immense mental strength during difficult times.. music has such a healing power!! Negative effect : If I have to make a travel without a music!! even that will make go crazy in a negative way and I will show that pressure on others. Music is very addictive and that's the problem!!
