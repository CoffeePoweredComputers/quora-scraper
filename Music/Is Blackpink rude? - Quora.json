            "answer_text": "Yes, very. They\u2019re so rude that they\u2019re literally the definition of rude. Like I can write an entire book series of why I think they\u2019re rude and why I hate them so much. They have no manners at all and it\u2019s just unacceptable! R- Really effing talented U- Unique voices D- Damn, they are beautiful E- Every member is important But seriously\u2026 They\u2019re honestly so impolite.  God, look at how Jisoo got angry at her manager? She\u2019s so disrespectful, but cute?What even?!  Why is Jennie smiling for no reason? Can we all just give an uwu for this?  Ros\u00e9 is abusing that poor apple slice. But even her eating is adorable? RIP apple.  Now Lisa is just plain mean! She\u2019s making fun of camels, that\u2019s not okay! Like she is such a cutie, it\u2019s not fair! - In conclusion, the BLACKPINK members are so ruthless to my poor little heart T-T  Edit: I wrote this answer back in November 2019 and I\u2019m still getting comments like \u201cOMG I hate you, why would you call BP rude?\u201d and \u201cBP isn\u2019t rude at all!\u201d. This whole post was a joke to begin with. I literally made up an acronym for the word \u201crude\u201d which should be more than enough to say that I was trolling the OP that asked the question. I even made little comments under every picture and GIF, joking about how rude they were, but THEN contradicting my previous comments by calling the members cute. And then, I wrote about how the BP members were ruthless to my heart, meaning that I couldn\u2019t handle their cuteness. If that all wasn\u2019t enough to tell you I was joking, I really don\u2019t know what to say. Some of you even have the audacity to call me names and write hate comments when you could\u2019ve took a few seconds to read some of the other people\u2019s comments where they were all playing along with me, knowing full well I was making fun of the OP.

            "answer_text": "No, stop trying to find anything bad about blackpink because they are popular. They aren\u2019t rude to anyone.   Although Jennie has a rbf so she may look cold sometimes doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s rude. Jennie has been called the rudest member for some time. Behind that cold looking face is a sweet girl.  A girl who put her fans over her  a girl who have her hairpin to an anti  a girl who gave her towel to fan that looked like they were gonna faint  A girl who takes gifts from her fans even though she could get in trouble for it  A girl who turned her fan to a fan who looked hot  A girl who spent her money to give her fans scented candles, cafe gift cards, and slogans  a girl, who despite being bullied her whole career never stood up for herself, only her members  a girl who paid over 30k of her own money for a truck and gave Korean blinks gifts from Hera and lunches  A girl who prepared face masks, hot packs, and photo cards for blinks attending music core  a girl who donates supplies, food, and medicine to animal shelters   Please don\u2019t judge a book by it\u2019s cover. Of course all of the other members are sweet and not rude, but Jennie gets called rude the most when in fact, she\u2019s probably the sweetest member. That\u2019s saying something because of how sweet and caring all of the members are. Don\u2019t forget Jennie is a human too. She has never done anything rude. She goes out of her way to be kind and care for blinks and her members.  Not to mention blackpink got together and donated 40 million won to the victims of the Gangwon fire. All of the members are kind and caring. They have a girl crush concept, yes. They sometimes look rude, yes. But they are the sweetest, most caring people ever. ",
