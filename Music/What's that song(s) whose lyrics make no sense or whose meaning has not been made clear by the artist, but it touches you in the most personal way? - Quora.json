            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A but I find myself really confused to answer this question.  I focus on lyrics quite a lot. Probably more than the music itself at times. I'm one of those guys who read into lyrics again and again to try and find really absurd meanings and interpretations to different songs, and sometimes let others know what we've come across. So 'Chop Suey' by System of a Down might sound total gibberish to you, or maybe you'll relate it to suicide (or suicide bombers like most do) but I'll probably go ahead and tell you it's about domestic violence. Or how 'Hey, Soul Sister' by Train is about a blowjob (well, about someone pretty good at it). Yes, I spend an awful amount of time on songmeanings.com. So any song whose lyrics don't make sense to me are the ones I didn't think had lyrics that needed being looked up, or I haven't checked em out yet. Even though I love random lyrics, and I've tried to write a few of my own, there's always some meaning behind the lyrics. So songs whose lyrics don't make much sense to me are kinda hard to find (at least amongst the ones I listen to) but I'll try and list a few examples anyway. Most of these are songs whose meanings I'm either confused about or haven't really gotten around to even trying: The Beatles - Norwegian Wood: So the guy sets the house on fire? What? I don't know. Tool - Pushit: Eh, it's been years since I've heard this track and will probably take years to listen to again.  Deafheaven - Dream House: This is sheer poetry. Nirvana - Pennyroyal Tea: Great track to jam and listen to. Quite unclear on the actual meaning. Scribe - I Love You, Pav Bhaji: \"Dear President, may I please show you my willy?\"... Faith No More - Cuckoo for Caca: Maybe it's about doing coke. Maybe not. System of a Down - Vicinity of Obscenity: One word: Banana. Isis - Weight: It makes sense in the context of the album's concept and theme but then again, there's just one sentence in the entire song. Of course there's many more but I don't wanna needlessly expand this list... Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "for me,there are few songs for which  I was unable to catch lyrics in one go but still like them for music & feeling that I can relate to them (without understanding lyrics.. :p) 1.Rill Rill by Sleigh Bells.  I really never get what lyricist want to say by lines like these,I guess it's teenage song.. Keep thinking about every straight face yes Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces What about them I'm all about them Six such straight As Cut 'em in the bathroom... 2.The cave  MUMFORD & SONS LYRICS   These lyrics have so much deep mean,I fail to get them sometimes..but when you listen it once,you kind of relate..
