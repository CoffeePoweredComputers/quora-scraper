            "answer_text": "I can discuss the key to effective communication. Ironically, it is also the most difficult part of communication. That would be listening, which is not to be confused with hearing. We hear with our ears. We convey listening with every fiber of our being. Body language. Communication is a two-way street. When we listen to someone, we give worth to them. They, in turn, will give worth to us and are then more apt to give worth to what we say. What body language conveys listening? Eye contact, slowly put a hand to your mouth, ask questions while repeating what was just said to you, nod your head. If you are speaking to a group, you might say something like, Miss Smith makes a very good point, or during the break, Mr. Jones brought up an excellent idea. I learned many years ago from Dr. Don Kirkley, who taught public speaking at the Pentagon in Washington, that the key to effective speaking is\u2026.hesitation. Pause. No more\u2026.than six words\u2026..at a time\u2026..without a pause. If you pause you are giving the listener time to process what you\u2019ve said. It also conveys confidence. It\u2019s a bit odd that when we are nervous we talk faster and say more, which is just the opposite of what we need to do; consequently, I\u2019ve learned to shut-up (briefly)\u2026.pause. Now, to be a better talker\u2026..for lack of a better word\u2026.emphasize the last sound of each word you speak. They may sound odd to you at first, but to the listener, it will sound very polished. To learn more about improving speaking skills, read the book, Rise Above: Conquering Adversities 2nd Edition. It\u2019s also available online in ebook format. ",
