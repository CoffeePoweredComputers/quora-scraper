            "answer_text": "So active pickups use fewer turns of a larger gauge wire in their construction. This actually results in lower initial output, but a broader frequency response. To counteract that issue, active pickups include a preamp built inside powered by a 9v battery (you can mod up to 27v too). They\u2019re actually filled with resin too. This also is why they\u2019re so quiet. From there, same principles that apply to a regular pickup apply to actives. Only real difference is the output of an active is substantially higher. Regular passive pickups probably range from about 250ma to maybe 700ma. Somewhere in there. Actives on a single note will output 1\u20131.3 volts. A strum can be between 2\u20134 volts. This hits your preamp harder and causes more volume and breakup from the amp. Active pickups also are clearer than passive pickups under heavy distortion. That\u2019s why you see metal guys with them. It\u2019s a good tool for their trade. ",
