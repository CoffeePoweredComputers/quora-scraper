You always keep me guessin', I never seem to know what you are thinkin'.And if a fella looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'.I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand,And then you smile, and hold my hand.Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you.Spooky! If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin',I'm gonna tell you all what my heart's been a-dyin' to be sayin'.Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin' my dreams,So I'll propose, on Halloween.Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you. Spooky, Spooky,Spooky,Oh-whoa, all right,I said Spooky! spooky song - Google Search ",
