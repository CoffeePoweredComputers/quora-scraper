            "answer_text": "Very easily. I have an Asus ROG G751JT. It edits video well, and kicks butt on Games. It really does it all. As an added bonus it is a \u201claptop\u201d so I can take it on the road. Though, calling it a laptop is a BIT of a misnomer. It IS portable, but it is very large. It doesn\u2019t have the best battery life. But, the 17\u2033 screen is nice for editing and having dual hard drives in a portable computer rocks. ",
