            "answer_text": "A loudspeaker does not \u2018know\u2019 it is producing several sounds. The identification of several sounds is done by your brain. The speaker is doing the best job that it can to turn the energy fed to it into sound waves. The process starts with a microphone doing the opposite, turning sound waves into energy, the characteristics of which can be stored, transported and reconstituted before being fed to a loudspeaker. The microphone did not \u2018know\u2019 what it was listening to. Sounds mix together in the air. They are detected as a complex variation in air pressure. The clues as to the origin of the sound or sounds is in the wave form, the way the air pressure changes. Your brain can analyse the sound fed to it by the ear and tell you what it makes up the sound. It can tell you other things about it as well. A single microphone produces a single \u2018channel\u2019. Spatial information is lost. If two microphones creating two separate channels are used a lot of spatial information is preserved. When fed to two spaced loudspeakers and listened to with two ears the resulting sound panorama is very convincing. The difference is in the timing and amplitude of the channels relative to each other. If you feed both channels to one loudspeaker or block one ear, the effect is destroyed. Years of practice have made the brain very good at processing sound but it is not infallible. It can be fooled if it does not hear the way a sound starts. I needed some short beeps to replace annoying sound effects in my sat-nav. To save time I recorded myself whistling and it sounded like it. No good! I the edited out the start (and end) to get the short \u2018beeps\u2019 I wanted. Very convincing! Just like an electronically generated tone. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, considering that an organ piano or string instrument has individual resonators to create individual frequencies this may inspire you to ask this question. A loudspeaker is a wideband system not intended to be resonant at a single frequency. Loudspeakers have a range of operating frequency. Multiple frequencies which normally occur in any piece of music are summed during the recording process, recorded onto the media (CD, DVD, etc) and played back through the speaker. The speaker system has a specified range of operation, midrange is essential and typically operates from a few hundred Hertz to about eight thousand Hertz. The important part of reproducing music (multiple frequencies) is to use the speaker driver in its useful range and to avoid compression (mechanical distortion). For speaker systems operating below a few hundred Hertz or above eight thousand Hertz then special speakers, woofers and tweeters can be added with crossover networks to separate their signals. Speaker signals (the signal waveform) ultimately resulting in mechanical motion follows the combined many many frequencies (their waveforms which are ADDED) all at once, no problem. The speaker drive signal is the combined frequencies of the program material and the speaker itself is a wideband system. ",
