            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what I did: After my sophomore year in high school, I switched from viola (started in 6th grade but never practiced much) to cello. I just liked cello a lot and wanted to play it. I started taking lessons and practicing pretty often during the summer. I practiced intermittently, in like 15\u201320 minute chunks and learned the Bach G major prelude and the Breval G major sonata, as well as scales. I wish I had done arpeggios and harmonic exercises as well, but I didn\u2019t know about that. I got a gold medal in group 4 at ISSMA that year, haha. (That\u2019s the Indiana Music competition that schools do, at the second highest level. I was proud) I unfortunately lost my teacher for my senior year of high school. I took a couple lessons with the bass teacher, but was beyond his ability to teach cello. At this point, I decide to apply at UIndy as a physics and computer engineering major. I get accepted because my SAT score was 1750 and my GPA was above a 3.4 (I forgot the actual number) which were above their averages. I applied to a few places and got accepted into all of them, but UIndy was the cheapest because I could live at home. I\u2019m very thankful I did this, because it saved me roughly 40,000 dollars. Room and board at a university is ridiculously overpriced. So is the tuition. Luckily, UIndy offered me a Richard Lugar grant for 10.5k a year, which was a bit less than half of tuition. I had a kind of change of heart a couple months after I got accepted - I wanted to be a Music major. I had been fascinated with orchestra from my middle and high school years and wanted to delve into it. Stringed instruments are pretty amazing to play and work with. They\u2019ve always fascinated me. I applied to audition on their last available audition day. I auditioned with the Bach prelude and allemande in g major at UIndy. Halfway through the allemande, I had a huge memory slip and completely forgot half the piece - I had memorized it months ago. I looked at the page and couldn\u2019t find it at all. After several seconds I simply restarted the second half of the piece, and they waved me to stop. We had a small interview immediately after my audition. I was still confident I wanted to go here even though I kinda blew one of my pieces, and I had already been accepted into the school, so I thought my audition didn\u2019t matter as much. Turns out the department can still choose to decline acceptance into their major and the audition is for the scholarship offer and placements. They must\u2019ve liked something though (the prelude did go quite well and I played the piece quite nicely for someone who had only been playing for two years); They offered me a scholarship of 8.5 thousand dollars a year for a music major scholarship. So I had a pretty good stack of scholarships - tuition would\u2019ve ended up costing me like 16k total, and that\u2019s something my parents offered to handle completely. Unfortunately, I almost threw it away because I wanted to change majors halfway through my sophomore year in college (sound familiar?) to psychology, a subject that had always fascinated me but I had never taken a class in. I grew quite a lot as a musician during this time, and decided I wanted to switch back\u2026 (I thought this would get me a lot of worry from the \u2018rents but they were both very supportive. I\u2019m incredibly privileged.) When I switched, college became a lot less stressful but a lot more expensive. When I came back, I regained half of my previous scholarship. I ended up with 10k debt for it. This is one of the best possible outcomes of college. The tricky thing is that the actual experience of going to college for anything but direct skills is not worth the cost. Join clubs of subjects you enjoy, got to folk schools, learn yourself. College isn\u2019t worth the debt. It doesn\u2019t provide you with anything but a piece of paper. If he can go for free, go for it. Maybe he\u2019ll like it. I wouldn\u2019t make him go, from an alumn\u2019s perspective, or from an objective worth evaluation, or even from the perspective of my brief study of psychology. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I signed up for the music scholarship auditions at the colleges I was interested in attending. If your son is planning to play in college, have him research the audition requirements at the schools he\u2019s interested in, then start preparing pieces. There may also be a theory test involved in the audition, but as far as I\u2019ve been told, that\u2019s more for class placement than scholarship money. I would advise against trying to learn more theory just to do better on the test, because he might be placed in a class higher than what he is prepared to take. I\u2019m sure there are other ways he can earn music scholarships as well, but I imagine these are mostly through independent organizations in the form of submitted videos. I\u2019m not totally sure, but definitely look around on the Internet and talk to guidance counselors, music teacher, etc. to see what you can find. Best of luck to him! ",

Do some research as some universities offer such scholarship and he doesn\u2019t need to be doing a course related to music.

If all these areas fail, you could ask businesses to sponsor him. ",
