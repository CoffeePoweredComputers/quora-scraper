            "answer_text": "It disturbed me a lot in many ways. I had/have been a fan of Gustav \u00c5hr or better known as Lil Peep for several months prior to his passing. He was one of the new acts of hip hop that I really saw a lot of potential in. I would never in my mind him dying at such a young this stage in the career. I mean I knew he had a lot of anxiety, depression and drug addiction issues. But I thought and hoped that at least he would stick around for another 10 years or preferably longer than that. I found him to be very talented and was listening to him almost everyday for the past week right before his death. So it fucked me up a lot. Especially cause I could see myself in him in a lot of ways with battling depression, lonliness, anxiety, drug addiction and suicidal thoughts. And we were almost the exact same age and even shared the same first name for fucks sake. It was just a really sad situation. And what frustrated me so much was the fact that he got faked xanax by a sketcy dealer. Say what you wanna say about the drug xanax. But it\u2019s infact extremly hard to overdose on xanax alone. You would need between 1000\u20132000mg of xanax to die from it. One bar is only 2 mg. So you would need to pop over 500 to die from it. Now I\u2019m not saying you should do high doses of xanax or even use it at all for that matter unless you got a prescription from your doctor. But I\u2019m just tired of people saying his death is something it wasn\u2019t. No he didn\u2019t die from xanax or overdosed on it. Lil Peep had been giving faked pressed xanax bars that contained fentanyl which is an extremly powerful opiate that\u2019s even a lot stronger than heroin. Sadly this is just another proof of why the war on the drugs has been a huge disaster. People are not going to stop using drugs even if you don\u2019t like it, it just doesn\u2019t work that way. Humans have experienced with drugs such as magic mushrooms or alcohol for thousands of years just to state 2 quick examples. It has always been and will always be here. As long as there is deman it will be supply. So by making it illegal won\u2019t change a damn thing it just pushes the market to the black market underground. Where the substances that is being sold is not controlled or regulated and may not even be anything close at all to what you think you are getting and which is why people are dying from right to left. Just as we see with the current opiod crisis in america. It\u2019s time for politicans to take this serious and decriminalize the user of drugs and give them real help instead of looking at them as criminals which won\u2019t solve a damn thing but possibly killing them in the end\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I really wasn\u2019t into Lil Peep at the time when he died. However, I got into him about a year after his death. A friend of mine from high school introduced me to his music and I didn\u2019t realize that Peep was so cool. I also think what really won me over was his song Awful Things. When I heard it, it didn\u2019t sound like he was rapping. It sounded like that he was actually singing. Plus, I was surprised that it was a rock song because it had the guitar playing and the genres of the song were alternative rock, pop punk, pop, emo, and trap. I was surprised to see that kind of diversity in a rapper like Lil Peep because you don\u2019t see that in most artists these days. While I think he was a good rapper, I still think he was more of a singer than a rapper. Now that I know about him and he\u2019s not around anymore, I feel bad because I wish I could\u2019ve gotten into him sooner. When I get the chance, I\u2019m gonna watch Everybody\u2019s Everything on Netflix so I could learn more about him. ",
