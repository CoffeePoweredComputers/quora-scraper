These days the hip-hop types are moving the most freight, and the bean counting lines get blurred when you have to consider who and how much did what and what platform are we talking about. Someone's always going to say it's The Beatles and that's that. The other guy will say it's Dylan. Garth Brooks The Grateful Dead have been recorded playing live a lot A WHOLE LOT. Does that put Garcia in the running? Zeppelin, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd? EVERYONE had a copy or two of those bands records. Elton and AC/DC put out a record a year for seemingly 30 years. Rick Rubin and Dr. Dre are responsible for tons of sales, do they count? Whitney, Brittney, Madonna, Ri-Ri, Tay tay? Slim Whitman? Vicente Fernandez? Juan Gabriel. I don't think anyone can say for certain, do you? Too many intangibles. In the end my vote goes to\u2026. The Rolling Stones! Longevity, influence, at or near the top of the heap for a good decade, tours, merchandise, hits\u2026.shoite, they've done it all, and if that isn't success.. ",
