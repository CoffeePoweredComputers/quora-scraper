            "answer_text": "Once a week for a half hour or hour, or every other week for a half hour or hour, is what I would recommend.  There is no reason to go more than once a week.  You need to take time to practice on your own.   Of course, if you are a fast learner and you want extra lessons, you can try to schedule them in, but generally it's cost-prohibitive to take lessons as it is, so that may be difficult for most people to handle financially, even if you can handle the time commitment. To find a good teacher, references are important.  You want someone who is well versed in vocal pedagogy and the science of the voice, who has consistent, beautiful technique, and the patience and very, very well-trained ears and eyes to be able to judge what you are doing with your voice and help you to immediately become aware of the sensations associated with correct and incorrect techniques you may be using. Sometimes there are vocal or singing teacher organizations - this is the one my teacher (Rocio Guitard) is the director for the teacher mentoring program for: International Voice Teachers of Mix  You can click on \"Find a teacher\" - all of them have to test in to join the organization. There are likely many others.  In addition to finding a qualified teacher, you want someone you will listen to instructions from happily, because teachers need to ask you to do a lot of strange things to get your voice to the right places.  You may feel weird, but that is expected.  Choose someone whose voice is pleasant or appealing to you, who is great at demonstrating the differences between the different vocal coordinations, and remember that you can change teachers if you really find it's not working out.  Find some you like, take a trial lesson and see how it goes. Once you start lessons, regular, correct practice is important.  It can be 15-20 or 30 minutes a day, but no more than an hour.  Always warm up properly.  A good teacher will have a professional quality studio with quality recordings, so that you can listen to them and use them for your practice. Some people will learn quickly and be able to pick up techniques quickly, and others will struggle immensely or not spend enough personal time to practice put in, for whatever reasons.  It also depends on your starting point.  Do you already have some basic ability to match pitch and rhythm?  Have you had any prior training or participation at school in choir or other singing activities?  Do you have exposure to proper technique from family or friends? Singing is a joy, and the better I become, the more joy it gives me to listen to myself.  I know I still have plenty to learn and improve on, but I also know that I have come quite far since I started lessons a couple of years ago.  Had I known I would lose my voice from poor vocal habits, I would have started lessons when I was younger, instead of waiting until I got older and started to wonder what on earth happened to my voice. If you're wanting to sing and the feeling of taking lessons isn't a passing thought, I highly recommend finding a teacher and getting at least one lesson for evaluation.  That will help you go in the right direction.  If you're curious, you can post your sound clip online and there are a number of people on Quora who will listen and give you some initial feedback, including myself.  I only got up the courage to post my own clips today, after a lot of debating for a year, but you can't fear criticism, at least from a great teacher, in order to improve. ",

            "answer_text": "How many lessons? 1-2 lessons of 45min-1 hour should be enough.  More important for your development is consistent practice. In the beginning not too much, 30 minutes a day 5-6 days a week is fine. Consistency is the key: 10-15 minutes on several days is better than 2 hours on one day. How to find the right teacher? Find an experienced teacher who has worked with beginners and can teach the very basics. Some teachers are better in developing further those singers who already know the basics.  Ask for recommendations. Take a couple of trial lessons, maybe with several teachers so you have some reference. Check that the teacher is a qualified professional.  Some things to look for when you take lessons: It is important that the teacher is supportive and there is a good atmosphere for learning. I don't mean constant praising, but that any feedback is given in a constructive way.You learn some warm-up exercises that you can also do when you practice on your ownThe teachers helps you to help yourself and find your voice: after the lesson you know what to work on when you practice on your ownDuring the lessons it feels you are experiencing more freedom and ease in singingAfter a few lessons you should notice some improvement in your singingPay attention that you don't feel any pain or strain in the throat when you sing in the lesson (and inform the teacher if you do). If this continues, switch teacher.",
