Plus, wearing those suits made by Nudie . . .  Another band that deserves more credit from the mid 80\u2019s Rank And File-Alejandro Escavado  My Morning Jacket taking it to yet another level with Jim James.  The Wrens another band from the 90\u2019s  This is just a few I can think of, of course there are more. Uncle Tupelo split off into a couple of bands fronted by Jay Farrar or Jeff Tweedy.
