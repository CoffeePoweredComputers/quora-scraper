            "answer_text": "Few months back, a song entitled \u201cCloser\u201d by Chainsmoker released that touched my heart like I heard the song continuously for 20 times a day. Lyrics are as follow: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you. I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okayHey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet themBut I hope I never see them again I know it breaks your heartMoved to the city in a broke down carAnd four years, no callsNow you're looking pretty in a hotel barAnd I can't stopNo, I can't stop So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your RoverThat I know you can't affordBite that tattoo on your shoulderPull the sheets right off the cornerOf the mattress that you stoleFrom your roommate back in BoulderWe ain't ever getting older We ain't ever getting olderWe ain't ever getting older You look as good as the day I met youI forget just why I left you, I was insaneStay and play that Blink-182 songThat we beat to death in Tuscon, okay I know it breaks your heartMoved to the city in a broke down carAnd four years, no callNow I'm looking pretty in a hotel barAnd I can't stopNo, I can't stop So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your RoverThat I know you can't affordBite that tattoo on your shoulderPull the sheets right off the cornerOf the mattress that you stoleFrom your roommate back in BoulderWe ain't ever getting older We ain't ever getting olderWe ain't ever getting older So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your RoverThat I know you can't affordBite that tattoo on your shoulderPull the sheets right off the cornerOf the mattress that you stoleFrom your roommate back in BoulderWe ain't ever getting olderWe ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)We ain't ever getting older We ain't ever getting olderNo we ain't ever getting older. There is one old song, many of you might have heard it named \u201cSmile\u201d by Ronan Keating Lyrics are: Smile, an ever lasting smile A smile can bring you near to meDon't ever let me find you gone'Cause that would bring a tear to me This world has lost its gloryLet's start a brand new story now, my loveYou think that I don't even meanA single word I say It's only wordsAnd words are all I haveTo take your heart away Talk in everlasting wordsAnd dedicate them all to meAnd I will give you all my lifeI'm hear if you should call to me You think that I don't even meanA single word I say It's only wordsAnd words are all I haveTo take your heart away It's only wordsAnd words are all I haveTo take your heart away This world has lost its gloryLet's start a brand new story now, my loveYou think that I don't even meanA single word I say It's only wordsAnd words are all I haveTo take your heart away It's only wordsAnd words are all I haveTo take your heart away. Both of these song are really close to my heart. Hope you like it. ",
