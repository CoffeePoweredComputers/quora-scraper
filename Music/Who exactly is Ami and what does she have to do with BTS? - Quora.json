Wait- WAIT- I THINK I KNOW- *goes to twiter* *searches bts*    Ah\u2026  BAHAHHAHSAHAAHHAHSHAHAHAHAAHAAHHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAHAH- *ahem* Google translate is not very good. And when I say that, I mean.. its AWFUL. Since it doesn\u2019t know the writer, or who is receiving the message, many words, phrases, and ideas simply cannot be translated. Especially words that to many people mean something other than the literal translation. For example, army. To many people, it just means someone who fights in the military. But to many other people, it\u2019s a meaningful name of a BTS fan. So, google translate has a difficult time processing this. To it, bts was just talking about the military. And I bet grammatically that throws everything off. So, sometimes it translates to Ami. Depending on what exactly they\u2019re saying of course. No, bts isn\u2019t dating some girl named Ami. No, their manager isn\u2019t named Ami. They\u2019re just talking to us :). Hope this helps! -Rey Sidenote: From the comments and rereading this answer, I realized that obviously \u201carmy\u201d in Korean is probably just some random letters, or it means something random. Also, the mistranslation is caused by the fact that Korean doesn\u2019t have an R, hence \u201cami\u201d.  Oh my gosh, I think this is the most upvotes I\u2019ve ever recieved! Over SEVEN HUNDRED upvotes and OVER 20K views??!? THANK YOU SO MUCHHHH!!!!!!!!! :)) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAmi\u201d (\uc544\ubbf8) is BTS\u2019s fandom name. Some translations just suck \ud83d\ude02 \u201cAmi\u201d is how BTS\u2019s fandom name is written in Korean (\u3147= silent,\u314f = a, \u3141 = m, \u3163= i, the easiest Korean letter to learn) I\u2019m actually learning Korean rn. It\u2019s written in blocks, and 1 block = 1 syllable. But there are rules. It must be written a certain way. This is how the blocks are in the word \u201c\uc544\ubbf8\u201d: 1 2 1 2 Number 2 in every Korean block must be a vowel. If a word starts with a vowel, the \u3147 will go in number 1, then the vowel in number 2. But the tricky part is that when the \u3147 is put last in a block with 3 characters, it makes a \u201cng\u201d sound like in \u201cwalking\u201d. Sorry I got carried away! I felt the need to explain why the \u3147 was silent because why not? Enjoy the mini Korean lesson and take care <3 ~Vanessa ",
