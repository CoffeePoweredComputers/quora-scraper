            "answer_text": "2.5 octaves or more is not at all bad for an untrained singer. Most untrained vocalists are not able to sing around 1.5\u20132 octaves comfortably, let alone more than that. That being said, what matters a lot more is whether you sound good with that 2.8 octave range of yours. Having a wide vocal range is really of no use if you sound excessively strained or cannot create good music out of all the set of notes you can hit. ",
