No big fancy cameras or crew, just themselves, a coat hangar, some wire and a GoPro. These two always do the most unique methods for their music videos, that\u2019s why I like them so much. So, a fin is added to one side of the hanger, turning it into a sort of \u201ctail\u201d, which keeps it smooth and level while spinning. Doing an initial test we realized the more movement and energy was in the shot the better it would look. We shot a little of Kim dancing as she normally would and it just fell flat. She is dancing so aggressively in the shots that ended up in the video, she\u2019s basically moshing with herself. \u2013 Matt Johnson ",
