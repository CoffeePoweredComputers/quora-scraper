            "answer_text": "I have a few, but these hold the most personal and professional meaning to me, so here goes\u2026. Peter Gabriel, one of my favorite artists, made an album released in February of 2010 called Scratch My Back which was a cover of ten songs which Gabriel regarded as \u201cthe pinnacles of songwriting endeavor.\u201d While I like almost everything on this album, Tracks 6, 7, 8, and 9 are ones which I will often play on my way in to the office, where I do individual, couples, and family therapy for the rest of the day. These four songs and their lyrics provide me with a powerful combination of grounding, centering, and inspiration that help me to start my day ready to deal with intense emotions, trauma work, and helping people deal with stressors that run the gamut from the tedium of life to the finality of death. I\u2019ve always loved Peter Gabriel\u2019s own songs, but his covers of these four other artist\u2019s songs, all stripped down and sung with what feels like authentic emotion, are as good as any of my favorites, and they provide a foundation for my work day. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Track 6 is The Power of the Heart, written by Lou Reed. This song, with it\u2019s simple lyrics, reminds me of both the differences that exist in close relationships, as well as what ultimately matters\u2026the power of the heart.  The Power of the Heart - Lyrics: You and me we always sweat and strain You look for sun and I look for rain We're different people, we're not the same The power of the sun I looked for treetops, you looked for caps Above the water, where the waves snap back I flew around the world to bring you back Ah, the power of the heart You looked at me and I looked at you The sleeping heart was shining through, The wispy cobwebs that we're breathing through The power of the heart I looked at you and you looked at me I thought of the past, you thought of what could be I asked you once again to marry me The power of the heart Everybody says love makes the world go round I hear a bubbling and I hear a sound Of my heart beating and I turn around And find you standing at the door You know me I like to dream a lot Of this and that and what is not And finally I figured out what was what It was the power of the heart You and me we sweat and strain The result is always the same You think somehow we're in a game The power of the heart The power of the heart I think I'm dumb, I know you're smart The beating of a purebred heart I say this to you and it's not a lark Marry me today You know me I like to dream a lot Of what there is and what there's not But mainly I dream of you a lot The power of your heart The power of the heart \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. The lines \u201cYou looked at me and I looked at you The sleeping heart was shining through, The wispy cobwebs that we're breathing through The power of the heart\u201d capture what it is like for me as a therapist to be sitting across from a person who is a total stranger at first, who has come to my office and little by little begins to tell me why they are here, what is wrong, what hurts, what needs help. So much of the time we relate to each other behind our masks, unwilling to take the risk to be vulnerable with another person. I am always aware of the moment when the wall comes down, the mask comes off, and \u201cthe sleeping heart shines through.\u201d It is a profound thing to be able to be with another person in an authentic way, creating sacred space, and these lines always remind me of this. I also often think about the relationship between my husband and myself when I hear this song, as he is the one of the two of us to \u201clook for treetops\u201d and I am the one to \u201clook for caps.\u201d We are, as the song says, different people, not the same, but whose love bridges the distance. I love that. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Track 7 is My Body Is a Cage written by Arcade Fire, artists Jeremy Gara, Richard Reed Parry, R\u00e9gine Chassagne, Timothy Kingsbury, William Butler, Win Butler. The song is haunting and powerful, and has been used in a number of movies and trailers.  My Body Is A Cage - Lyrics: My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing with the one I love my mind holds the key My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing with the one I love but my mind holds the key I'm standing on a stage of fear and self-doubt it's a hollow play but they'll clap anyway My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing with the one I love but my mind holds the key my mind holds the key My mind holds the key I'm living in an age that calls darkness light though my language is dead still the shapes fill my head I'm living in an age whose name I don't know though the fear keeps me moving still my heart beats so slow My body is a is a is a is a is a is a is a is a My body is a cage My mind holds the key My body is a cage we take what we are given just because you've forgotten doesn't mean you're forgiven I'm living in an age that screams my name at night but when I get to the doorway there's no one in sight I'm living in an age realize I am dancing with the one I love but my mind holds the key you're standing next to me my mind holds the key Set my spirit free set my spirit free set my body free set my body free set my body free \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. This song is a must-listen-to before therapy work for many reasons. First, it stirs and reawakens my empathy for clients who are trapped in their bodies in some way, whether because of a chronic medical issue, chronic pain, vegetative depression, severe OCD, transgender issues\u2026.really, any issue that causes a person to feel stuck, trapped, isolated or unable to reach out to the people they love who are right next to them. It keeps me from feeling that \u201cJust Do It!\u201d frustration that anyone can have when working with people who are struggling to put one foot in front of the other. I love so many of the lyrics in this song, and the themes resonate with people who are in therapy: the mind holding the key, living in an age that \u201ccalls darkness light,\u201d being unable to forget even if one has worked to forgive, feeing fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and having nightmares. There is real anguish in the way that this song is sung. I feel desperation, dread, loneliness, and a fear of being hopeful in it. And at the end, probably due to the shift in key from minor to major, I feel hopeful always, even though there is no resolution yet, just a plea to \u201cset my spirit free, set my body free.\u201d Personally, since I have managed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, otherwise known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, since I was an undergraduate student, this song speaks to me, reminding me when I am well of what it is like when it does literally feel like my body is a cage, and reassuring me when I am undergoing another relapse, that others know exactly what this feels like, so I am not alone in that experience. Especially when I am the one struggling to put one foot in front of the other, and I am the one pleading for someone to \u201cset my body free,\u201d this song gives me the voice I often do not have, and it also reminds me that it is always my mind that holds the key to coming out of a relapse more quickly. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Track 8 is The Book of Love, originally written by The Magnetic Fields, and featured in the movie Shall We Dance?  The Book of Love - Lyrics: The book of love is long and boring No one can lift the damn thing It's full of charts and facts and figures And instructions for dancing But I I love it when you read to me And you You can read me anything The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from Some of it is just transcendental Some of it is just really dumb But I I love it when you sing to me And you You can sing me anything The book of love is long and boring And written very long ago It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes And things we're all too young to know But I I love it when you give me things And you You ought to give me wedding rings And I I love it when you give me things And you You ought to give me wedding rings You ought to give me wedding rings \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. This is the most \u201cfeel good\u201d song of the four tracks, sappy and \u201creally dumb,\u201d as the lyrics say. But it is the song that reminds me of the soon-to-be twenty years (this year!) of being married to the love of my life and he is such a source of strength, support, love, and inspiration that when I listen to this, I think of him, of us, of all that we have been through and continue to go through. And I\u2019m going to write this, even though it is \u201creally dumb,\u201d but I feel stronger and happier and more able to get through anything when I think about all of that. It\u2019s my secret superpower. As a couples therapist, it is so challenging to try to help break through impasses and entrenched relationship dynamics, to see both sides of a conflict and create a therapeutic relationship with not one, but two, people without either of them thinking I am taking sides, and teach all of the things that are in that Book of Love that is so heavy you \u201ccan\u2019t lift the damn thing.\u201d I am challenged to make what is the most complex thing on the planet\u2026living with, loving, fighting with, and learning from your intimate partner\u2026seem easy. And this song just reminds me how to keep it simple, stupid. Because love is not rocket science. It\u2019s the rocket. Read to me. Sing to me. Give me things. Love me. It\u2019s really dumb. But it works. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The last track I listen to before I head in to the office is Track 9, I Think It\u2019s Going to Rain Today written by another one of my favorite artists, Randy Newman.  I Think It\u2019s Going to Rain Today - Lyrics: Broken windows and empty hallways A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles With frozen smiles to chase love away Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today Lonely, lonely Tin can at my feet Think I'll kick it down the street That's the way to treat a friend Bright before me the signs implore me To help the needy and show them the way Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today Broken windows and empty hallways A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles With frozen smiles to chase love away Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today Lonely, lonely Tin can at my feet Think I'll kick it down the street That's the way to treat a friend Bright before me the signs implore me To help the needy and show them the way Human kindness is overflowing And I think it's going to rain today \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. I love this song, first because it is simply masterful poetry. Achingly beautiful, it powerfully captures the essence of what it feels like to be forgotten, homeless, discarded, uncared for. There are lines in the song that instantly remind me of places where some of my clients are: \u201cScarecrows dressed in the latest styles, frozen smiles to keep love away\u201d and \u201clonely, lonely.\u201d I don\u2019t know if the line in the song \u201cHuman kindness is overflowing\u201d is sarcastic or not, but I have always heard this song as a genuine call to engage human kindness, a call to action. It puts me in the right place to go in and be of service. Not as a a so-called \u201cservice provider,\u201d as the health insurance companies would like to inappropriately label me. Not to \u201cprovide a service,\u201d but to \u201cbe of service,\u201d as in to be of assistance or to be helpful. The bright signs that implore that we help others don\u2019t really mean anything to someone who needs to be seen, heard, and loved. Those signs are cold and hard. Rain can be cold and hard, too, but when I think of human kindness, I think of something warmer and more nourishing. And I like to think it\u2019s possible, before I begin my day, that that it\u2019s going to overflow. That it\u2019s going to rain. More on: Scratch My Back - PeterGabriel.com ",

            "answer_text": "Two songs come immediately to mind. One is by the Eagles and the other is by Ray LaMontagne. While several Eagles songs have amazing lyrics - The Last Resort is one of my favorite songs of all time lyrically and amazingly few people know it. It is a longish song at the very end of the Hotel California album, too long to be played on the radio and while the tone set by the music is perfect for the song itself, it lacked the dynamic punch you get from the title song and many other songs on the album. However, it perfectly captured the overall theme of Hotel California album. If Hotel California is the heart of the Hotel California album, The Last Resort is its soul. It is also just an incredibly beautiful song. When Hotel California came out, I was 10 years old and I liked the faster paced songs that grabbed you passionately, but when I moved down to Southern California for college and listened to the album again - I finally really heard The Last Resort; I would just listen and listen to it all alone in my dorm room, letting the meaning and emotions of the song wash over me. The song has aged incredibly well. The lyrics are particularly prescient now with so much focus on white privilege and how religion is a vehicle used to sell what is, at bottom, just base greed. The Eagles were singing about it in 1978: Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em,Put up a bunch of earthly boxes and, Jesus, people bought 'emAnd they called it paradise, the place to be,They watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea You can leave it all behind and sail to LahainaJust like the missionaries did so many years agoThey even brought a neon sign 'Jesus is Coming',Brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign We will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine?'Cause there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it hereWe satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deedsIn the name of destiny and in the name of God And you can see them there on Sunday morningStand up and sing about what it's like up thereThey called it paradise, I don't know whyYou call some place paradise, kiss it goodbye  The second song, by Ray LaMontagne, captures the beauty of life and the process of aging like no other song I have ever heard. The song is Winter Birds. Truly, I think it is the most beautifully written song I have ever heard, and I wouldn\u2019t say something like that lightly. I love Ray LaMontagne\u2019s early albums; I think he has lost his way a bit in the last few albums. Money kills creativity. Some people are thoroughly confused by Winter Birds because it weaves back and forth through time, like a movie that begins at the end, then flashes back in time to tell the story, seemingly from the perspective of the ghostly husband who appears to be watching and waiting for his love to join him: The Widow now owns that angry plowThe spartan Mule and The Crippled CowThe fallow field that will yield no moreAs the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor The stream can't contain such the withering rainAnd from the pasture the fence it is leaning awayThe clouds crack and growlLike some great cat on the prowlCrying out, \"I am, I am\" over and over again The days grow shortAs the nights grow longThe kettle sings its tortured songA many petaled kiss I placed upon her browOh, my lady, Lady I am loving you now In the next verse, we get the juxtaposition between the old and the young - the passing discourse between the winter birds and those that fly south for the winter, greeting each other as if old, old friends. The \u201cvoiceless trees\u201d is a great allusion to the leafless branches of winter trees making no sound when the wind blows through them, with the winter birds taking the place of those summer leaves of youth that have flown away to sunnier places, with the aged singing their wise old songs of the lives they have experienced and their readiness to move on. The winter birds have come back againHere the sprightly ChickadeeGone now is the Willow WrenIn passing greet each other as if old, old friendsAnd to the voiceless treesIt is their own they will lend The days grow shortAs the nights grow longThe kettle sings its tortured songAs many petaled kiss I place upon her browOh, my lady, lady I am loving you now And though all these things will changeThe memories will remainAs green to gold, and gold to brownThe leaves will fall to feed the groundAnd in their falling, make no sound Finally, there is the ghostly husband, thinking about his still living wife, looking upon her aging face and body, waiting for her to join him again, thinking of her and him together when they were both so young, when he was taking her to the county fair: Oh my ladyLady I am loving you now I've gathered all my money and I'm goin' to townTo buy my lady a long and flowing gown'Cause come tomorrow morningWe're off to the county fairI'll find a yellow flowerAnd I will lace it in her hair  ",
