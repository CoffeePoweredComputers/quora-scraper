There is one group that I follow A LOT more than other groups, and that kpop group is Got7 \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a. \uae40\uc720\uacb8 (Kim Yugyeom) is the maknae of the group. You might have heard of him about being in a groupchat with other '97 idols, such as Jungkook of BTS and Bambam of Got7. There are multiple videos that have been posted by Got7 of them doing pranks on Yugyeom\u2026 it breaks my heart everytime \ud83d\ude2d.
