            "answer_text": "The best budget violins in the Indian market right now are those by Granada (Chinese) and Hofner (German). Given your budget of \u20b910000, either the Granada MV-888 or the Hofner AS-045 would be a good choice. I personally use a Granada violin, which has a mellower tone than the Hofner instruments available in the same price range. In fact, even the Hofner instruments nowadays are outsourced from China, as told to me. However, \u20b910000 seems to be too high a budget for a beginner. I would suggest getting a violin for around \u20b95000, and investing the remaining amount in getting a good teacher, who's willing to teach you the basics in detail. Before even starting with the violin, you need to learn to read the notes, identify the time signature, as well as things like sharps, flats and naturals. Then there's the issue of learning to hold the bow and the violin, which an online video won't be able to convey accurately. For all these things, you need a good teacher. Now, within \u20b95000, you could check out the Granada GVA-10, but I'm not sure about the quality. It would be better to visit a local store such as N.N Mondal and Sons or Braganza's in Calcutta; or Furtados, Mumbai. All three are bound to have a good collection of locally manufactured violins suitable for beginners. Finally, invest in a few more things- A decent set of strings. For a beginner, the Alice A705 set would be perfect, as it's far better than the default strings that come with the budget violins.A good rosin, such as the ones by D'Addario.A shoulder rest.A good case which can hold the above three. This is optional though.Well, that's all. Best of luck, and I hope you enjoy learning this magnificent instrument. P.S: Always carry an extra set or two of strings with you. Violin strings can snap unexpectedly sometimes! The spare strings don't need to be too expensive, check out the local brands like Karuna and True Tone. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t buy NOW ! As similar to any other New Venture Resolution, you need to test the waters before investing money on this new found interest of yours. I believe you would be learning online, which in my view is a wrong choice to begin with. I would suggest you to sign up for a class for in person learning. Your instructor would have spare violin for you to start learning. If time permits, extend your class hours to continue the self practice sessions. Once you get a hold of the concepts, you will be a best judge on what size / type / sound(ing) violin you would like to buy. There are wide variety of violins available starting from Rs 5000 (app 90 USD). Hope you will be able to make a good choice then, rather than now. ",
