            "answer_text": "I think this question contains some confusion. MIDI is a kind of language. It is used to communicate. For example between your keyboard (pads and keys) and your computer. There is software to work with MIDI, assigning CC-codes for example. Then there is software using MIDI. Some are just to sound as musical instruments, you play your MIDI-keyboard and out of your computer come piano sounds, or French horn, or saxophone. Or the notes you play are written on your screen in music notation, or you record your playing in a DAW, making track after track. Or your software learns you to play. It's a bit like asking 'What should I buy when I want a diesel engine', it might be a truck, a train, even a steam roller. What do you want to do with it? So the question should be what you want to do with your MIDI-software; just play music, record just what you played, record multiple tracks, make sheet music, whatever. Some audio interfaces and MIDI-keyboard come with a lite version of a DAW, like Presonus or Ableton. Reaper is not expensive, it might be a good choice to spend that little sum of money and learn working with a DAW extensively. Free software can cost you tons of time and frustration. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you want notation (or just want to be able to record and play MIDI). Midi Editor allows you to record, edit, and quantize MIDI with a very straightforward \u201cpiano roll\u201d(/keyboard)-style GUI. It\u2019s about as intuitive as they come. Anvil Studio is a lot more full-featured (and let\u2019s you edit and loop audio as well), as well as providing sheet music and guitar tab notation and an event list for MIDI tracks. While still relatively straightforward, it does have a steeper \u201clearning curve\u201d than MIDI Editor. ",
