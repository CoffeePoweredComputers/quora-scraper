            "answer_text": "This is going to sound weird coming from me, because I\u2019m actually more of a rock and roller, but I feel like that also gives me a unique perspective on the issue. It took me awhile to get into rap in the first place. I had that rocker mentality of us versus them, but as I got older, and eventually didn\u2019t give a crap, I started to actually like the genre a bit. Now personally for me, I still don\u2019t like a lot of rap songs because I feel like a lot of them simply have one beat set up and the variations are done with the lyrics. I\u2019d say those are the deep cuts for people who truly adore rap, but I\u2019m not one of them, but; if you can get me a rap song with a good, heavy beat, variation throughout the song, a solid and defined verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, you will make me a very happy man. Despite it being mumble rap, I consider \u201cThis is America\u201d by Childish Gambino to be a paramore of this. Huge variation in the son, not simply in the beat but the entire emotion that the music is delivering. Heavy beat at times, happy beat at times. Strangely enough it was a mumble rap song that actually delivered a message. Good singing, good rapping, good music, this song is the whole package. So I would say, what makes a good rap song? Variation and a strong beat over laced with crisp words, (again a bit contradictory since my example was from mumble rap, but it\u2019s Childish Gambino so give me a break). ",
