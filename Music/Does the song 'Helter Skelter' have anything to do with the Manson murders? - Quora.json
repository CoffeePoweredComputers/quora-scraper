            "answer_text": "Manson was obsessed with the Beatles \"White Album\". He believed that there would be a race war in the US, whites against blacks, and that the Beatles were also aware of this and made references to it on the album. There was a \"Manson interpretation\" of many of the songs on the album. In particular, Manson believed that \"Helter Skelter\" predicted that the blacks would win the race war, and that it also contained coded messages that would allow Manson's \"family\" to escape Los Angeles safely. He began using the term \"Helter Skelter\" as a code for the race war, and ordered the murders as part of a plot to set it off. (\"Now is the time for Helter Skelter.\") At the scene of the La Bianca murders, one of the killers wrote \"Helter Skelter\" on the refrigerator in blood. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. Patricia Atkins couldn\u2019t even spell it right at the LoBianco murder scene. She wrote HEALTER SKELTER [sic] in one of the victim\u2019s blood on a wall. The words mean the same here as they do in the UK, running around in crazy directions, but in England it is a phrase for children. The song was on The Beatles\u2019 WHITE ALBUM, and deep down, Manson thought he was going to start a race war because, in his addled brain, the Black Panthers would be blamed for the murders. The word \u2018pig\u2019 (slang for cop) was written in several prominent places, including in Sharon Tate\u2019s blood on the front door of the Cielo Drive home. The honest truth? Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecuting attorney, started using that phrase right away so he could make a bathtub full of money writing a book a few years later. If he had let it go, and I do believe this because of the misspelling of the first word, the words helter skelter would have drifted away. Bugliosi needed to throw those words to the reporters. NOTE: The beginning of my answer reads odd because the original question was changed slightly. ",
