            "answer_text": "I\u2019d probably say Everything Ends is probably the darkest song lyrically because it specifically is about Corey\u2019s attempted suicide after breaking up with his then girlfriend. He talks about cutting himself and realizing how messed up he is in that moment. With lines from \u201cmy eyes turn from blue to grey\u201d and \u201cI am only conditioned to die\u201d, how can it not be the darkest song? ",
