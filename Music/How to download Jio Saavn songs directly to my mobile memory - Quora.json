            "answer_text": "Let me get straight to it. You can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s impossible. Songs on streaming platforms like Jio Saavn, Gaana, etc., are downloaded within the app and can be easily listened offline without internet.  The drawback is that you can\u2019t share them on Bluetooth or Wifi with another person. Search for mp3 songs on the internet and you might find it if you\u2019re lucky. Thought it\u2019s a waste of time. Thank you.  Source: Google images. ",
