I was working full time and had just had a litter of pups that would be 6 weeks old on the day. My son called and pressured me into hosting dinner and he would bring a ham. Fine, that will be easier for me. On the day we're all sitting around and one of the kids mentioned that he didn't smell turkey. It took 10 yrs before they let me off the hook for that one. But we got 10 years of laughs out of it. ",
