            "answer_text": "Full-tuition scholarships are only given to a handful of entering students who has filed both FAFSA and CSS. It is a very selective & competitive process, and are given to those who produce great talent & the need for financial assistance. I wish you the best of luck. Talent meaning your instrument & music theory proficiency: how far have you mastered your instrument performance/improvisation/recording/music production/music theory, etc  GPA is only earned through completing the course. It is not something that could be earned before you attend the school. However, if you want to save your time.. I can give you some advice. Even if Berklee is a music-based school it requires minimal credits in liberal arts (math, English, science, history, electives) for graduation. You can take these courses at other community colleges or universities and transfer them to Berklee. This way you do not need to pay $3000 per Berklee's liberal arts course when you can take it elsewhere for $1000. It is financially strategic.  Another sweet advice: Learn everything about music theory, classical harmony, jazz harmony, and piano playing before attending Berklee. You can test out these beginning level courses so that there is space in your schedule for you to take higher level courses. This is something I wish I knew before attending Berklee. ",
