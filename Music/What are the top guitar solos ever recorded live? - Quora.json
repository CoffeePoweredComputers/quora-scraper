            "answer_text": "Pat Metheny's pick (from the book \"Voices In Jazz Guitar\") is Wes Montgomery's solo on \"If You Could See Me Now\" from the album \"Smokin' At The Half Note\". He says \" (it) is the greatest guitar solo I've ever heard\". Almost all of the 35 premiere jazz guitar players interviewed in this book specify Wes Montgomery as the their most influential guitar player, ever. My favourite solo is Jerry Garcia playing steel on \"Candyman\" from American Page on beauty.it's not exactly live to an audience, but it still makes a very definitive statement about the human condition in the most poignant, \"hurtin'\" tone I've ever heard. Brings tears to my eyes every time! The solo kicks in about 3:05:   I still like my answer, but it's come back to my mind at least a thousand times since I wrote it, and now, I think it's a pretty dumb question! I've been floored by many players when I see 'em live ... Orville Johnson comes to mind; I've seen him numerous times and marvelled at his ability to satisfy my musical taste. I'm not a folkie, but I've been gobsmacked by Valdy's skill and sheer force of personality. The list goes on and on ... However, I just heard Hotel California by the Eagles after a long time, and those solos by Walsh and Felder absolutely define the pinnacle of rock guitar performance. I feel a bit pedestrian sayin' it, but they are just a full order of magnitude above nearly everything else in the genre. ",

            "answer_text": "Charlie Christian \"Waiting For Benny\"  This is literally Benny Goodman's band jamming in the studio while they wait for him to arrive (you can hear him enter at the end.) \"Solo Flight\"  Charlie's playing is so guitaristic - check out the crunchy clusters at 1:23. Django Reinhardt It's hard to pick a single Django solo. Here's a tasty compilation.   Here's Django's unaccompanied \"Solo Improvisation #1.\"   And here's some (sadly brief) footage of Django where you can see how he compensates for his burned hand: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1rfw_django-reinhardt_music Grant Green \"Down Here On The Ground\"  Starts off as cheesy lite fusion, but wait until the groove kicks in, then forget about it. John McLaughlin Miles Davis - \"In A Silent Way\"  I know, Mahavishnu and Shakti and all that. But the older I get, the less interested I am in virtuoso displays and the more interested I am in melody and lyricism. Jerry Garcia \"Help On The Way/Slipknot!\"  From Blues For Allah, the most groove-oriented Dead album. \"Morning Dew\"  From good old 5/8/77. The archetypal Jerry ballad -- the little cascading figures he plays during the quiet parts are so beautiful. Prince Prince might be the best living rock and funk guitarist. My favorite solo of his is \"Kiss\" -- Prince doesn't allow YouTube, just go listen. ",
