            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a celebration of low effort minimalism and generation z detachment that\u2019s rooted in a future that doesn\u2019t exist, a past that\u2019s been romanticized beyond their familiarity, a sarcastic and ironic nod to the absolutely shittier music that was already out there, and a product of 2019 - a year when we still glorify any dude with a lap top who can properly package a teenage girl with a voice in a way that looks so stale\u2026 that it\u2019s somehow fresh. Its not entirely bad, but it\u2019s not exactly Whitney Houston, it\u2019s not a good faith effort, it\u2019s not any more than exactly 1/2 of an ass of effort, and that\u2019s part of the message. She\u2019s here to say that this is the hardest she should try, and she has a point - we haven\u2019t exactly given a better world to people that age. If anything, we\u2019re the garbage, not her ",

            "answer_text": "I like her James Bond theme . She has done a very good job in my opinion . She is one of those people who will polarize opinion . I have no doubt that she is currently a huge favourite of teenagers and maybe even pre teens . But the older generations won\u2019t much care for her. I watched her set at Glastonbury last year out of curiosity. I can\u2019t say she made any impression on me either way. So I was surprised when I heard she was going to be recording the new James Bond theme. But I have to say she has done a very good job. The people involved in James Bond clearly want to appeal to a younger audience , and I suspect they have now succeeded. Bravo Billy ",
