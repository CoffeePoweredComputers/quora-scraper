            "answer_text": "Smoking cigarettes never made my voice raspy. What it DID accomplish was: - It took away my ability to sing high notes. - It messed up my pitch and tonal accuracy. I was doing everything during singing that should have kept my tone even and strong yet my tone would waver/falter beyond my control. - Smoking had a HUGE impact on my ability to hold a note, my projection, and stamina. My voice was weaker and I got winded. I would take what felt like as deep a breath as I used to while singing and the results were, again, not the desired effect and, again, beyond my control. Try as I might, I couldn't control my voice the way I had been able to before. And this is saying a lot because aside from singing, I also used to play trumpet - first chair. So I really knew how to breathe, project, hold a note, etc. I quit smoking a year ago. Very shortly after I had stopped, I noticed a profound difference - I was getting back everything mentioned above that was lost to smoking. With smoking cigarettes comes annoying/gross phlegm, addiction, a financial drain, sinus problems, bad breath, nicotine stains on teeth, yellowing teeth, it dries out the skin, ages you harshly, carcinogens = cancerous, etc.  Not a good idea to take it up. I smoked for 5 years (not counting 2 years before 18 when I infrequently was able to bum cigs from people). Quit when I was 22. It's not worth it to start up such a terrible habit. Believe me, I know. Part of my thinking for starting smoking was largely that I wanted a rougher voice like Joan Jett. Turned out carbonated drinks was what actually helped me develop a more gravelly sound. I don't drink soda anymore, but sparkling water sometimes. Basically I found that something which coats the throat is actually a lot more effective and beneficial to developing a rougher sound than cigarettes ever were. Drying out your throat will only damage it and cause you to cough.  My husband can sing EXACTLY like Axl Rose and he grabs a handful of honey packets from the gas station before we go out to karaoke. It's more about kind of squeezing the lower neck muscles or something to make the raspier, rougher sound. I don't really know how to describe it. ",

All of these things can make your sound raspy, but none of these things are actually that easy to control... I sort of feel like what you're trying to ask is analogous to saying \"if I mess around with knives and ink, can I give myself a tattoo?\" I mean, sure, maybe, but it's not the most accurate or safe way.
