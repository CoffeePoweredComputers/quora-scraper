            "answer_text": "That is to largish degree the whole point of Joni Mitchell. She wasn\u2019t just a singer with a nice soprano voice who was pretty, she was a very gifted musician who wrote songs that were quite unique in their musical ideas and movement. Songs like \u201cThe Circle Game\u201d and \u201cClouds\u201d from her early days were relatively typical popular-type songs that people play around the campfire, but she moved toward songs that were much less typical, much more complex and subtle and much more difficult to cover. And then eventually some the melodic strength of her songs started to fade, and they became angular and different without being all that pleasing or surprising. But overall, she wrote astonishingly original and often very beautiful music. ",
