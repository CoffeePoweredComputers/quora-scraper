            "answer_text": "During his senior year in 1979, Yankovic recorded his parody of The Knack's \"My Sharona\" in the acoustic-tiled bathroom across the hall from the college radio station, finding a microphone cord long enough to reach back to KCPR-FM's tape deck to make it possible. The song got a huge positive response on Dr. Demento's show, but \"My Bologna\" was the song that turned Yankovic's hobby into a career thanks to a backstage meeting with The Knack after a campus concert. Fortuitously, Rupert Perry, the VP of Capitol Records, was also present when Knack lead singer Doug Feiger professed to liking Al's parody. Yankovic remembered Feiger turning to Perry and saying, \"'You guys oughta put this song out on Capitol Records.\" Perry agreed, and Al soon signed a six month contract. So yeah, I hope you enjoyed that little history lesson. ",

            "answer_text": "It was not so much an individual song as getting lots of airplay from the similarly weird radio host Doctor Demento in Los Angeles. Some of the songs were \u201cAnother One Rides the Bus\u201d and \u201cI Dig Rocky Road\u201d. The earliest songs were just Al and his accordion. ",
