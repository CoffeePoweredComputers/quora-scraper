The amount of promotions and favor Lisa has been receiving lately is much more than Jennie ever did but I obviously don't want her to receive hate. Poor Jennie still receives hate for the long gone favoring. But people like to justify YG favoring Lisa by saying that she worked hard and got so popular and only then YG started favoring her. But duh! Favoring is still favoring. Also, even her huge fanbase don't mind this but all of them would rightfully bash Jennie if she gets favored. The double standards you see. I hope YG stops doing this, they all are just 4 members, they all deserve better and equal treatment. ",

Like we already YG, it feels they're trying to tell us \u201cLook see! Equality for all members!\u201d\u2026 ut was only after yg kept getting attacked that they gave lisa more things.

They only promote her more than Rose and Jisoo because she\u2019s globally popular. Not to mention she is a rapper, which are kinda favored by YG. She also brings lots of attention to YG and Blackpink, so it makes sense if they promote her. ",
