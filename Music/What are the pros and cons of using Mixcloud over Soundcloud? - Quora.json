            "answer_text": "Although it started as a hub for underground musicians, SoundCloud's success and the consequent signing of the three major record labels (Sony Music, UMG and Warner Music) has placed a lot of heat on the service. As a result, SoundCloud has become stricter on copyrights, which means that they take down many DJ mixes that sample unlicensed music. Mixcloud on the other hand is not under the same heat on copyrights as SoundCloud. As SoundCloud continues its onslaught on DJs, it's leading many DJs to migrate to Mixcloud where the copyright rules are more relaxed. SoundCloud offers great analytics on plays and followers. Free users can track the number of plays, likes, comments, reposts and downloads their music is getting. Pro users can even see their top fans and the countries in which their music is popular. In addition to all these, Pro Unlimited users can also see what device their music is being listened from \u2013 websites, applications and social media networks. Mixcloud does not offer analytics for free users. However, upgrading to the Pro account gives you access to an analytics dashboard. From here, you can see the number of people listening to your mixes, where this traffic is coming from, and their location. In addition, you will get access to \u201cengagement graphs,\u201d which let you know at which point listeners stop listening to your mix. This can help you trace patterns and see what works well for your mixes, and what does not https://soundcloudreviews.org/mixcloud-vs-soundcloud-point-by-point-comparison/ ",

            "answer_text": "While Mixcloud and SoundCloud are both online music sharing and streaming services, they are focused on different kinds of content creators. Mixcloud is more focused on DJs and presenters while SoundCloud is focused on individual artists. Mixcloud has unlimited uploads while SoundCloud has limitations depending on your account type. SoundCloud is more interactive for listeners, and makes it easier for them to download music. Mixcloud is less stringent on copyright issues. SoundCloud offers better analytics, though Mixcloud users can also get access to analytics with the Pro plan. Finally, Mixcloud has a much smaller user base, though this is likely to change as more DJs migrate to the service due to SoundCloud's crackdown on copyright.
