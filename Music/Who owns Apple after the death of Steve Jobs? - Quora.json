            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs' death is irrelevant to who owns the shares. Jobs himself owned a very small fraction of Apple stock at the time of his death. Those shares went to his wife or into a trust, depending on what was stipulated in his will. For the most part, the shareholders in Apple are the same before and after Steve Jobs death, with minor fluctuations as shares get sold and bought. So to answer your question directly: the same people own Apple after the death of Steve Jobs who owned it before his death: the shareholders. ",
