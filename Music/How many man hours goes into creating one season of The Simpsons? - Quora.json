            "answer_text": "To create a single episode of The Simpsons takes, on average, about 6\u20138 months. That\u2019s just for one episode. The process begins with a pitch. (~1 month, 16\u201360 people) The overall idea for the episode is laid out before everyone involved, and that idea is either rejected, or accepted for production. Pitches take place at a retreat in Southern California, where all the episodes for the forthcoming season are decided. Each pitch is about a minute or so long, and gives with basic idea of what the episode will be about. Next comes the writing phase. (~6\u20138 weeks, 1\u201316 people) This is what it sounds like. An episode\u2019s writer will write the first draft of the episode in the span of about two weeks. After that, the writing staff, comprised of many people with many different styles of storytelling, many different senses of humor, and just generally different minds, will spend the next four to six weeks doing rewrites, preparing the script for a table read. The showrunner and producers will also review the script and give notes to make sure it fits with what they envisioned for the season. After that table read comes the voice recording. (~2 weeks per season, ~20 people) Again, this is what it sounds like. The voice actors head into a studio and record their lines. Fun fact: The actors are rarely, if ever, in the same room when they record their lines. All voice acting is recorded separately and edited together. *Note* The next phases of production will cover the remainder of time, and will involve anywhere from 120\u2013500 people. Next comes storyboarding/story reel/direction. Artists work with the writers and producers and director of a particular episode and essentially map out what the episode will look like. They plan each and every shot, matching it up with recorded audio. They design the way everything will look once it is sent to the animation studio, and is, to use the words of long-time Simpsons storyboard artist Luis Escobar \u201ca blueprint of an episode\u201d. When the storyboard artists are finished, they upload their work to a server, and it is picked up by the next team. This team works to essentially \u201cclean up\u201d what the storyboard artists did, working with the same people mentioned above to make a final product before it goes to print. Then those storyboards are revised, made to match any rewrites that have been made, any changes of heart the producers, showrunner, or director may have had. Which brings us to the layout phase. According to the aforementioned storyboard artist, this is closest to what the average person would imagine when thinking of \u201canimation\u201d. Character poses are mapped out, specific things in the background are mapped out, minute movements, facial expressions, the way shots are framed, it all happens in this phase. Then we get to the timing phase. This is exactly what it sounds like. The layout products are timed specifically to fit the voice acting performances, down to the microsecond. This is an in-depth process, and it is where the finest points of the animation are done, e.g. if a certain inflection of a character\u2019s voice requires a certain facial tick, this is when it is completed. Next comes the checking phase. Again, not too hard to figure out what this is. Two people go over what\u2019s been completed so far with a fine tooth comb. They check the animation for any errors, any misalignments in what is seen and what is heard, everything. And FINALLY, the work completed thus far is sent to AKOM, the South Korean animation studio that has handled The Simpsons for the last 25+ years. This is where the finishing touches are placed, but if that sounds like a menial part of the process, think again. This is, without question, one of the most important aspects of the production. This is where everything that has been done so far is made to look as it does when we turn on FOX to watch the show. The edit the colors, the shadows, the movements, everything. This is where it all comes together. And that just leaves us with the final review. Everything that has been done is gone over yet again to make sure it\u2019s perfect. AKOM sends the final product back to the producers, who in turn give the shareholders a viewing. Also in this time period is when topical, relevant-to-current-events can be added. Once it is agreed unanimously the episode is complete and ready, it is sent to FOX for broadcast. SO. To answer your question, let\u2019s figure it out. Let\u2019s say, conservatively, that\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026500 people work on an episode. It takes 6\u20138 months for an episode to be made from start to finish, but obviously people don\u2019t work nonstop 24 hours a day for half a year, so for simplicity\u2019s sake we\u2019ll keep it (very) conservative and say eight-hour works days for six months, no weekends. This comes to roughly 134 days, which at eight hours per day is 1,072 hours. 500 people on that schedule comes to 536,000 hours per episode. For an entire season? Let\u2019s say there\u2019s 22 episodes in a season, this comes out to 11,792,000 hours. HOWEVER This number is impossible to actually discern. Any number of those 500 people can and do work on multiple episodes at one time. There are infinite variables to take into account in each and every step of the production process, and the figures I gave are merely estimates from someone on the outside looking in. Either way though, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of man hours. Nick Botic nickbotic.com ",
