            "answer_text": "They talk instead of singing.- Yeah, they do. Leonard Cohen talks all over all of his songs, but he is still called one of the greatest songwriters of the Rock and Roll era. Calling what Lou Reed(RIP) did singing is a stretch, but he is regarded as one of the most influential voices of his generation. Sprechstimme, the singsong type of speech singing used in such great canonical works as Berg's Wozzeck, is merely the use of the natural tonal properties in speech as a musical instrument. Rap is music.They don't even speak properly- Proper according to whom? Rap is a product of urban blight, poverty and the necessity to express, that is informed by bleeding-edge slang, up-to-the-minute fashion, and current events in the inner city (this is how rap started...I'm not saying that it is this now...it's grown beyond these parameters) When jazz was the popular music in America, it too was derided for not being musical. Now, it is revered, and rightly so. Both of these musics are the products of Black Americans. I'm beginning to see a pattern...are you? There is no melody- I don't know what \"established music norms\" you are referring to, but in my study of music, Arnold Schoenberg, John Cage, the aforementioned Berg, and Charles Ives made it a point to write music that did away with the conventional concept of tonal center. These composers did this 70+ years ago. Any set of \"Music Norms\" needs to take into account these pioneers of 20th Century compostion, which make this point quite moot. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes- I suggest you listen to some early Eminem, anything by Rakim, Public Enemy, and especially Aesop Rock if you want internal rhyme, extended metaphor and the like. Simple rhyme schemes have their place, especially in early rap by the likes of Run-DMC, the Trecherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, when the artform was in it's infancy. When the main reason to rhyme was to exhort others to join in the celebration, simple worked better than complex. Nowadays, rap has expanded to include personal expression, and grand storytelling, so you're going to find the complete range of rhyming from Chief Keef's embarrassingly simple couplets to Brother Ali's fully-formed tales of opression and triumph. Open your ears, and listen. You might be surprised. They use words to rhyme , but not to complete a thought- Again, you need to expand your hip-hop listening. One of the most valued skills in battle rhyming is the ability to set up and complete a punchline. Punchlines not only have a fun rhyme scheme, they also lead you along, like a good comedian, and then POW! the last line blows up all over the other rapper, hopefully to face-covering approval by the audience. Completeing the thought, forcefully, is a mark of an accomplished MC. The \"Music\" is on an eight-second loop- Again, I'm going to suggest some listening. Timbaland, El-P, Pharrell...these guys make high-concept, very complex and highly listenable music. What's more, is there are many changes, rhythmic, melodic and otherwise, that keep the interest of the listener. People wonder why these guys make the money they do. It's because when they make a track, people dance. I've tried to do it, and it may be the hardest artistic thing to do outside of stand-up comedy. They don't play instruments- OK, the vast majority of them don't. But the Beastie Boys did, to great effect. As do The Roots. I have to say also, that this question takes a very narrow view of music. Hip-hop has been the most popular form of music around the world (questionably) and in the US for sure. I hope that you can expand you're experience. I'm not saying that you'll love it, but you should respect it as an American art form. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't believe it's taken me this long to post a comment, but after several years of enjoying all of the great insights and perspectives from the Quora community, I absolutely MUST chime in on this question.  With nothing but respect for other people's musical inclinations, I humbly, but strongly, disagree with your take on this. In an effort to not make this a mere rant, I won't get into all of the intricate details of why hip-hop, or rap, for me, is the greatest form of musical expression and creativity in the world...which in my opinion, it is. I'd rather just make a quick statement and then provide you with a list of artists who truly embody this form of art.  Hip-hop, in its roots, was forged out of struggle. Much like the blues, it's an expression of the realities of life for (the most-part) an underground society.Or, stated another way, the mainstream garbage you hear on the radio that espouses (mostly) materialistic escapism, has NOTHING to do with real hip-hop...and I'm guessing this is what you're basing your opinion of it on. REAL hip-hop is, and forever will be of, by, and for the underground. Wu-Tang Clan is probably the best example (for most people) of grimey boom-bap seeing commercial mainstream success. But what the Wu did was shed just a little bit of light on the unbelievable amount of talent that exists within the underground. So rather than listening to me go on and on about why REAL hip-hop is so great (because I could), here's some artists I highly encourage you and any other musical enthusiast to check out: Jedi Mind Tricks (Philly, PA)Army of the Pharaohs (East Coast US)Immortal Technique (Harlem, NY)Rhyme Asylum (London, UK)Wu-Tang Clan...specifically GZA & Method Man (New York)Gang Starr (New York)...RIP GURUDilated Peoples (Los Angeles, CA)LowKey (London, UK)Swollen Members (Vancouver, B.C., Canada)Living Legends (Los Angeles/Bay Area, CA)Heiroglyphics (Bay Area, CA)The Pharcyde (Los Angeles, CA)Sean Price (Brooklyn, NY)Jurassic 5 (Los Angeles, CA)Atmosphere (Minneapolis, MN)Brother Ali (Minneapolis, MN)The Left (Detroit, MI)Zion I (Bay Area, CA)Cali Agents (Bay Area, CA)Aesop Rock (New York/Los Angeles)Cannibal Ox (New York)El Da Sensei (New Jersey)EPMD (New York)R.A. The Rugged Man (New York)Eric B. & Rakim (New York)Roc Marciano (New York)Scarface (Houston, TX)The Roots (Philly, PA)The Alkaholiks (Los Angeles, CA)Snow Goons (Germany) I left out quite a bit, particularly the early pioneers like Public Enemy, Run-DMC, Fab 5 Freddy, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, etc...nothing but respect for the forefathers of the genre...but any real hip-hop fan out there who can resonate with this list, please feel free to chime in.  And, yes, I realize I left out the heavy hitters like Jay-Z, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, NWA, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, etc...All talented artists, all contributed immensely to the industry...but not, in my opinion, the defining artists of the genre as many prop them up to be.  And yes, I realize I didn't mention the likes of Kanye West, Drake, Lil' Wayne, and some of the other dregs of hip-hop's corporate puppets (please refer to the \"mainstream garbage\" reference from earlier. Real hip-hop is an unadulterated expression and commentary of (among other things) struggle, progress, perseverance, wisdom, social injustice, love, hate, raw, grimey, boom-bap passion. Born in the U.S....now very well represented internationally. The hip-hop underground will continue to thrive, as long as it remains underground.  That's all I got. Peace and love. ",

            "answer_text": "Your list of points suggests you haven\u2019t listened to much hip-hop, only the very narrow subgenre of mainstream hip-hop you\u2019d hear on the radio. You\u2019re also confusing rapping, a vocal style, with hip-hop, a genre of music. I\u2019m going to put the points I think needed addressing the most first, so don\u2019t be confused by the numbers jumping around: 7. They don't even play the instruments. Most pop artists don\u2019t play instruments, does this mean the instrumental backing to their tracks is not music? Of course not. Same for the fact most rappers don\u2019t play instruments, it doesn\u2019t mean the instrumental backing to their tracks is no longer music. Here\u2019s a video of the Beastie Boys playing their instruments while rapping (they started out as a punk band before branching out into hip-hop and eventually funk) does the fact Adrock is rapping make the music they\u2019re playing on their instruments no longer music?  4. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes. If you were writing rhymes like this a third grader you were some kind of child prodigy: \u201cPalestine, Kosovo, Kashmir / No different than the avenues right here / An increase in the murder rate each year / Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear / Curtains up on the theatre of warfare / Dramatic politics nightly perform here / Worldwide from Columbia to Coumbine / Stockholders keep the dollar signs underlined.\u201d \u201cPenitentiary chances / The devil dances and eventually answers / To the call of Autumn / All them fallen / For the love of balling / Get caught with 30 rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin.\u201d 1. They talk instead of singing. Wrong. They don\u2019t talk, they rap. Sometimes singing is involved too, for example Yasiin Bey aka Mos Def frequently combines singing and rapping in his songs. >2. They don't even speak properly. That\u2019s because they\u2019re rapping. Unless you\u2019re referencing rappers who use certain slang or have regional accents, in which case that\u2019s obviously not true. 3. There is no melody. Now it\u2019s starting to just sound like you haven\u2019t listened to any hip-hop before. 5. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought Not inherent or unique to hip-hop, just a sign of bad song writing. 6. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop Another thing that isn\u2019t inherent or unique to hip-hop. This is just bad songwriting. Unless you\u2019re referring to beats making use of loops, which would of course be incorrect due to beat changes. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear White People (I have always wanted to start a Quora answer this way), Greetings. I am at least as white as many of you. I am a professional opera singer; can you think of a whiter profession than that? If so, please let me know, and I\u2019m sure I could dabble in it. I\u2019m here, as a subject expert in \u201cestablished norms in music,\u201d to tell you that rap is music. It\u2019s sort of astonishing to me that I even need to say this, but after reading many comments on Habib Fanny\u2019s absolutely wonderful answer, it\u2019s come to my attention that many of you disagree with the objective fucking truth: that rap is music. To borrow from the lyrics of a great musician: \u201cNow I ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 she a [closet racist], but she ain\u2019t messin\u2019 with no [traditionally white genres of music].\u201d The standard critique of rap as music is that it lacks melody. Cool. Please sing for me the melody of the most famous section of Stravinsky\u2019s famous The Rite of Spring, called the Augurs of Spring (audio below, if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about). Can\u2019t do it? I didn\u2019t think so. Whole genres of music are built without melody. Would you consider minimalist music not to be music? How about percussion music? And even on traditionally pitched/melodic instruments; think about the way solo banjo is played, or bagpipe music. Is anyone asking on Quora whether bagpipes count as music? (BTW, for those of you considering a cheapshot in the comments against bagpipes, that\u2019s fair, but actually high-level bagpipe music is really cool).  (The Augurs of Spring) \u201cIt\u2019s not that it lacks melody,\u201d I hear you say, \u201cit\u2019s that it lacks pitch and tone!\u201d In the examples I give, those are all pitched instruments. Funny you should say this, because human voices rapping also have pitch and timbre. Have you ever considered why we can tell the difference between DMX rapping and Jay Z? The difference is far more extreme than the difference between a bassoon and an oboe\u2014it\u2019s not just pitch and expression, it\u2019s a huge timbral shift. I\u2019ve also heard the argument that it\u2019s not about what\u2019s embedded in rap, it\u2019s about what rap is famous for: the fact that people like rap overwhelmingly for its use of text makes it not music. Cool. So does Bob Dylan still count as music, even though his music is almost 100% about text? The bottom line is that none of the arguments against rap as music are applied with any consistency. The same people who wish to categorize rap as something other than music due to these qualities ignore the same qualities in other, traditionally white, genres. In point of fact, rap is often the most sophisticated pop music around. Think about the way sampling is done in rap and compare it to borrowings in Handel, or to 20th century tape music. Rap has an extremely sophisticated musical lineage and heightens it in ways that huge numbers of high-level musicians find compelling. So this has been a fun little conversation that we\u2019ve been having, but it\u2019s time to stop. Rap is music. Often very high-level music. I appreciate that this issue gets a whole new segment of the population interested in becoming armchair music theorists, but this argument is totally racist nonsense. Love, always, David ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, rap, rap music or rapping is music and as a part of music, it is art. A lot of various people are defying rap as not a part of it due to their lack of musical knowledge or just due to their subjective opinion.  1. The first thesis is partly correct, but, rapping or rap is a genre of music which is not based on singing or showing how high or pitched your voice can be, instead, it is based on your flow (how do you pronounce your rhymes, at what tempo, can you or cannot control your breath, how long can your verse be etc.) and on your delivery (how your rhymes will be ''delivered'' to the audience, or better, to the microphone - for instance, will you stress some to you important syllable or even a line). Also, it is important how do you feel the beat. A good rapper should know how to be in a perfect symbiosis with a beat, even though nowadays there are more and more good off beat rappers.  2. You are probably referring to mostly black rappers who've invented a whole new slang so they could understand among each other and differ from other subcultures. And this is the main reason (language) why hip-hop is a subculture.  3. Actually, there is. I assume you mean that there is no melody in their voices. Well, many rappers have monotonous voice in their delivery, but, you can find many rappers that sound better than most of mainstream pop singers. I am going to take an example of Andre 3000 who has a great melody in his voice, and also Big L who has a great nasal voice.  4. This is definitely not true since one of the most important things for a rapper is an intelligent verse. This statement probably comes from a person who never heard of any other rapper than Jay Z, Eminem, Snoop Dogg and other mainstream rappers, so I'll take it for granted. There is a sea of rappers with high intelligent verses like Aesop Rock, RiFF RAFF, Action Bronson, Nas, Wu Tang etc. who had more words in their art than Shakespeare in his. But, it's not only important to use many various words, it is important to gather them into song that makes sense - like Aesop Rock does. His lyrics are full of metaphors, allegories, puns and wordplays that you can't understand what is he talking about even after listening to the song for 20 times. His lyrics are usually about rap/music corruption, life themes, death, philosophy, money and its effects, and he has a lot of to talk about since he had several nerve breakdowns. Rappers are better lyricists than rockers or metalheads, not only because they've invented a whole art from delivering written words, but because they can entertain you with their words. But also, multi-syllabic rhyming, wordplay, even famous stories (Immortal Technique - Dance with the Devil) all come from rap. So, we can say that their rhymes are at advanced levels compared to other music genres.  5. There is a thing called ''stream of consciousness''. A lot of rappers prefer this retelling technique when telling stories/anecdotes/life lessons in their songs. So, since you can't be in their skin, it is hard to accept when a rapper jumps from one point of view to another philosophy. Sometimes they don't have sense, but in most, they do. Great storytellers are the Wu-Tang, Action Bronson, Aesop Rock, GangStarr and especially NaS, which career is based on simply retelling his life as a juvenile in Queensbridge, NYC.  6. Could be, but it doesn't have to. All depends on the producers who make the beats firstly, then instrumentals. There is plenty of repeating oldschool producers like DJ Premier (he's a great producer, but his beats are exactly 8 sec loops), Dr. Dre; while there are revolutionists like RZA. New producers are even better since TRAP has been introduced (El-P, Blockhead etc.). In Croatia, there is a sea of great producers like Vojko Vru\u0107ina, TREEZ, Flowdeep, Kre\u0161o Bengalka and others who are inovative and creative.  7. Some do, some don't. Some oldschool producers created their own samples by playing on instruments. Nowadays, you have samples and loops on every corner which is little ruining rap. Some Croatian producers are also multi-instrumentalists playing often more than 5 instruments. Others make music on samplers or on computer programs (Ableton, FL Studio etc.) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, rap is a genre of music.  To address the extremely silly points you raised: They talk instead of singing.Rapping isn't really talking. It emphasizes rhythm in a way that talking does not. It isn't singing, of course, but music doesn't need singing to be music. I'm sure you're aware of the existence of instrumental music. They don't even speak properly.Rappers often use a dialect of English called \"African-American Vernacular English\" or \"Ebonics\" (although I really hate that term). Lots of music involves dialects. Some rap isn't in AAVE, of course. There is no melody.Rapping is usually not melodic, but the rapping is usually accompanied by melody. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes.Rappers use all kinds of rhyme schemes. Even if they only used very simple ones, though, that wouldn't prevent rap from being considered music. Lots of songs have very simple rhyme schemes. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought.Rappers choose their words for all kinds of reasons. They often tell long and interesting stories while maintaining a complex rhyme scheme. Even if they didn't give a damn about coherence, though, that wouldn't prevent rap from being considered music. Lots of songs have nonsense lyrics. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop.The instrumental part of a rap song might be highly repetitive, or it might not be. Even if it is highly repetitive, though, that wouldn't prevent rap from being considered music. Lots of songs have highly repetitive instrumentation. They don't even play the instruments.Rappers usually don't play the instruments. Some of them do, though. Even if they didn't, though, who cares? Opera singers don't play instruments, either, last I checked. Really, the impression I'm getting here is that you've heard one or two party songs on the radio and have made exactly zero effort to learn about the genre before passing judgment on it. Which is a great way to look foolish. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Rap is music. Your points do not put rap outside the \"established norms\" of music, whatever they might be. Many of your points related to the lyrics of rap music which you claim use 3rd grade rhyming schemes, involve talking instead of singing with no melody, and use words that don't complete a thought all of which are not spoken properly. Even if all these claims were true (and they're not) it still doesn't disqualify rap from the classification \"music.\" Mary Had a Little Lamb uses a 3rd grade rhyming scheme but it's still definitely music and it would be even if it wasn't sung \"properly\" . Scat singing is mainly rhyming without any thoughts at all, it's still music. All natural speech contains a melody of some kind. Natural speech cadence is melodic. As far as I'm aware there has never been a definite set of rules that a melody needs to fit into before it can be considered music. Even if rap music is on an 8 second repeated loop, and played without a single instrument (and again that's not actually true) that still doesn't mean it can't be called music. Music can be created by any means the musician dictates. It can be performed on a cello or by someone banging a cello with a carrot or by someone using the cello setting on a casio keyboard or by someone tapping the C E L and O keys on their keyboard.  You clearly don't like rap music. I don't care for it much myself. But just because you don't like something doesn't mean you can redefine the term \"music\" to exclude it. ",

            "answer_text": "A simple yet complex question. Here is my take on this: I STRONGLY DISLIKE rap. However, I also MOSTLY LISTEN to rap. Need me to explain? Of course you do, you are an average rap fan. Here it goes: The rap \u2018\u2019formula\u2019\u2019 is really appealing to me - you have a simple rhythm which is catchy and easy to follow, you have a great opportunity to express yourself, along with freedom to do so, and the main focus is (should be) on the lyrics, on the content of the text. There are so many songs in so many other genres which have like 2x4 lines of verses, and 2 or 3 repetitions of the chorus, which is only catchy and nothing else. I hated this in my earlier days, and that made me choose rap over other genres. However\u2026the vast majority of rappers seem to be satisfied with being sub-par\u2026They are scared to do any kind of experimentation\u2026they are too dumb or high to talk about anything other then being dumb or high\u2026They rhyme the same bleepin\u2019 words over and over, like there isn\u2019t an INFINITE choice of rhymes out there\u2026 What really gets me is the relationship the fans have to the rappers\u2026In any other genres, I can truly understand the reasons why some people worship certain artists\u2026For instance, they will say \u2018\u2019oh he\u2019s cute\u2019\u2019, or \u2018\u2019I like the rhythm of the songs\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019I like anything that has an electric guitar in it\u2019\u2019, etc. However, a rap fan will more often then not say something so off that you would think that there are little people in them controlling their breathing for them\u2026Examples: \u2018\u2019I like (such and such) rapper because he is conscious.\u2019\u2019 And the guy is rapping about ancient conspiracies so removed from reality that he probably has assistance getting up from bed in the morning. \u2018\u2019I love (such and such) rapper because he is real.\u2019\u2019 And the guy talks about doing drugs in infinite amounts while simultaneously having sex with every girl you ever had\u2026and that\u2019s about it. \u2018\u2019I adore (such and such) rapper because he is intelligent.\u2019\u2019 Yet, the guy gives life advice comparable with \u2018\u2019leave school, shoot someone and rob them\u2019\u2019. Yeah, a real scholar. \u2018\u2019I respect his skill because he is one of the rare rappers who knows how to freestyle\u2019\u2019. Yet, freestyle is literally the easiest thing to do - you just list things that rhyme. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I do appreciate a good, different freestyle when I hear it - but the people who can rap them are NOT the ones getting praise, but those who rhyme the super-simple nonsensical crap. (yo yo, I am in the house, I like bitches, but I am no mouse) I went on a bit of a long rant here, but I hope you get my point. Rap should be a cool thing\u2026but rappers ruin it, and they get away with it due to a vastly unintelligent audience. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of listening to third-grade music nowadays listen to actual, real, rap songs back in the 90s or 80s when Hip-Hop was at it\u2019s peak. I\u2019m gonna go ahead and prove why every point you made is completely absurd and idiotic. Rapping is classed as singing, whether you sing fast, slow, high, deep. Whatever. If it goes with a good beat and it has rhythm it can be classed as singing. Heck, it doesn\u2019t even have to rhyme, just needs rhythm and beat and actual lyrics.Pretty sure if you researched Hip-Hop, you\u2019d know it\u2019s underground music, therefore a lot of people who grow up in bad neighborhoods use slang terms because that\u2019s how they grew up.No melody? Are you - by all definitions - blind?! The beat is classed as melody. The voice is classed as melody. Rapping is all the melody you need.Again, the point I made when I started typing, listen to Hip-Hop songs back in the day - 2Pac, Notorious BIG, Nas, NWA, Big L, Slick Rick, Big Daddy Kane. Anything to get you to understand THOSE people don\u2019t mess around. You\u2019d drop dead thinking about how those lyrics are even possible.\u201cNot that complete a thought\u201d please rephrase that. If you mean they don\u2019t give thought to their music then you\u2019re wrong. Sure a lot of modern Hip-Hop songs aren\u2019t very well thought out but the classic ones, especially freestyles are legendary, you\u2019d most likely never come up with as complex rhymes as Big Daddy Kane, Biggie or Nas.How.. please tell me how. Do you mean the hook? It\u2019s called a hook for a reason? Do you mean the beat? It\u2019s a beat, it\u2019s occasionally repetitive. Please get your head out of your ass and make some valid points and listen to the genre before criticising with your horrific grammar.So what if an artist doesn\u2019t play an instrument? What, because one rapper can\u2019t use a guitar or play the piano automatically means the genre isn\u2019t music? A lot of artists in other genres didn\u2019t play an instrument. What, do you think a painter isn\u2019t a painter because they can\u2019t paint AND be the one being painted?Please think before assuming that kind of stuff. It\u2019s insulting. Rap/Hip-Hop is music, it has been since the late 70s and until a decade ago became a cultural phenomenon and prevented a lot things such as excessive racism being allowed, abuse against woman, sexism, police brutality and police corruption. Had you actually known that and listened to the artists I listed above you wouldn\u2019t have typed that load of crap above. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Per the question comments I don't think it is music, and here's why: They talk instead of singing. They don't even speak properly. There is no melody. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop They don't even play the instruments. I'm sorry but based on established norms in music these would point to rap not actually being music. What do you think? Is this music? It doesn\u2019t even have words.  What about this? Instead of instruments, Tchaikovsky used an actual cannon.  This one has words, but it has no rhyme scheme that I can detect.  This one is moronically repetitive, but being \u201cpop\u201d it\u2019s generally classed as music.  (Sorry about that one folks, had to make the point) Finally, these guys don\u2019t use instruments.  So, by your \u201cnorms\u201d, none of this is really music. Look, rap is music. This is pretty clearly music. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s got a beat, and it is in fact telling a story.  Now, it\u2019s perfectly okay if you dislike rap. I dislike rap. It just doesn\u2019t appeal to me. There are several styles of music that just aren\u2019t my cup of tea. I dislike most pop music too. I kinda hate elevator music.  Just because you dislike rap doesn\u2019t make it not music. Now, not being a rap fan, I don\u2019t know enough to go into the origin, history, development, and evolution of rap as a genre of music. But I know it\u2019s there, and I know there are people who could explain it in exquisite detail. But I thought it might help to hear from someone who also dislikes rap. It\u2019s still music. Even if you don\u2019t enjoy it. Now don\u2019t try to tell me this isn\u2019t music too. And it\u2019s not even human music!   Original question-Does rap count as music? Established norms in music would point to rap not actually being music. ",

            "answer_text": "In the US, it depends on whom you ask.  Let\u2019s take a deeper look at the demographics. The more you approve of Trump, the more likely you are to think that rap is not music.  The older you are, the more likely you are to think that rap is not music.  If you don\u2019t have a college degree, you\u2019re more likely to think that rap is not music.  The more conservative you are, the more likely you are to think that rap is not music.  The less urban your neighborhood, the more likely you are to think that rap is not music.  The more you believe that federal welfare spending is too high, the more likely you are to believe that rap is not music.  What\u2019s going on here? All these are markers associated with cultural conservatism in the US. And political identity, more often than not, is a reflection of cultural identity. Rap is associated with Blacks. Blacks are a prominent part of the American conservative out-group, to the same extent that rural Whites are a prominent part of the in-group. And people often define themselves in opposition to perceived elements associated with the out-group. For instance, I became an ardent supporter of gay marriage precisely when I started solidifying my view of conservatives as my out-group. It\u2019s not entirely surprising that demographics groups associated with conservatism feel more antagonism to a perceived element of Black culture. You would have had the same reaction if you\u2019d asked people about Jazz as an art form in the 1920s. That being said, although I don\u2019t have any data to support it, I would bet that rap is more accepted as music today than it was 30 years ago. And 30 years from now, there will be even fewer people who reject it as a form of music. For more similar discussions, follow me at Sophokagathia. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's look at your list, shall we? I don't think it is music, and here's why: They talk instead of singing.They don't even speak properly.There is no melody.They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes.They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought.The \"music\" is on an 8 second loopThey don't even play the instruments.I'm sorry but based on established norms in music these would point to rap not actually being music. What do you think? Singing is not even a prerequisite to something being music.And Bob Dylan or Dave Matthews or Jens Kidman enunciate their sung words properly? (Answer: they dont.)Drums and percussion have no melody, but they're music.And The Beatles didnt on songs like Nowhere Man?And again, The Beatles didnt on Strawberry Fields Forever?But you don't have an issue with half the songs in the world composed in the last few decades are made in the same tired as hell I-V-vi-IV chord progression?Some singers don't either, but I don't see them taking crap for not playing an instrument.What about using the definition of music instead of \u201cestablished norms of music\u201d that you made up yourself (because if we were talking about truly established norms in music, then there won't even be a debate because the norm is that rap is music). Oxford defines music as: vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion. Thus: Vocal or instrumental sounds - rap has bothBeauty of form - of course, as rap is held to the same rhythmic standard as any other music, and the same writing standards as musical lyricsHarmony - of course, as it combines rhythm and words in a specific manner and styleExpression of emotion - without doubt as expressed in the choice of words, rhythm, flow, and timbreHaving checked out on all points of the objective definition of music, rap is without doubt music.

            "answer_text": "There are already a ton of great answers here, but I'd like to highlight Joseph Guthrie's answer because it does a great job of responding to each \"point\" you are trying to make. Instead of answering point-by-point, as many have already done so, I will say this: I encourage you to expand your horizons and listen to a wider variety of hip-hop music.  There are plenty of artists who are commonly referred to as \"rappers\" but who actually sing a whole lot more than they rap. Akon is a great example of such an artist. Here is a great song by him:   Akon - Freedom P.O.S. is one of my favorite underground rappers who doesn't use a lot of slang - you might find his lyrics interesting.   P.O.S. - Purexed Wale is a rapper whose music is often very instrumentally vibrant - here is one of my favorites by him.   Wale ft. Cee-Lo Green - Gullible The far-too-common condemnation of rap music as \"not real music\" is very annoying and always comes off to me as very racist and classist. You're minimizing the cultural contributions of rap music simply because it doesn't conform to your standards or your tastes. However, these contributions are valid and necessary - rap allows people who suffer injustices on a daily basis to vent their frustrations, demand change, or simply speak about their daily experiences. They often celebrate their success and provide inspiration for others who are struggling to get out of the hood, talk about their ambition and the hard work they put in to achieve success, and offer advice to those who are still struggling. To question whether an important cultural outlet actually \"counts\" as music is insulting.  Also, as a middle class white girl who has listened to rap since my pre-teen years, I can say that rap music has given me insight into the struggles of those who are less privileged than myself and helped me be more aware of the injustices that continue to exist in our \"post-racial\" \"everyone-has-a-shot-at-success\" society. So rather than listening to rap music and trying to come up with a bunch of reasons why you hate it, try listening to just one song and find the actual meaning behind it. Hear the artist's pain, listen to the message they're trying to convey, and stop comparing it to the music you prefer to listen to. Accept that it is a different type of music that usually doesn't target people such as yourself, but appreciate it as a valid and unique art form nonetheless. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it does, but not good music. I base that comment on its longevity. Rap is as disposable as any other pop pap. In a couple of years 99.99% of rap around today will be forgotten. Whereas, quality music stays around forever. That\u2019s why we still sing Beatles songs, fifty years after they were hits. There's also a huge irony about rap. Rap is putting spoken words on top of a rhythmic backing. The words are everything. Poetry. Social comment. But in the vast majority of cases the diction of rap artists is so appallingly bad that you cannot understand a word they are saying. This is rap\u2019s elephant in the room, the thing nobody wants to admit. The rapper \u2018s new clothes. So I wonder about the validity of a musical form that claims to be all about words, but then makes those words incomprehensible. What is the point? Rappers could be reciting a phone book and you\u2019d never know. Yes, I\u2019m sure there are exceptions, but in general that\u2019s how it is. And everybody knows it. Ask any teenage rap fan to tell you the words of any rap song they've been listening to, or even tell you just the gist of what those words say, and they will probably be unable to. I\u2019ve done this. I even had one teenager tell me \u201cBut it\u2019s not about the words! \u201c and then was unable to tell me what it IS all about. I suspect it\u2019s \u201cI listen to rap because all my friends do\u201d. And that\u2019s perfectly fine - pop music has always been about fitting in with your peer group. Nothing wrong with that at all. But it\u2019s definitely not about the words. Also, with rap, the backing track is often stolen - sorry, sampled- so it\u2019s somebody else's creativity. Plagiarism, if you like, which is always dubious. Even if the rap artist has paid royalties to use the sample, it\u2019s still copying somebody else's work. Not creative at all. Easy. Unadventurous. Unimaginative. No, rap is not for me I\u2019m afraid. When I want to listen to music, I don\u2019t want it to be somebody shouting incomprehensibly at me. That\u2019s not what I want from music. ",

            "answer_text": "1. They talk instead of singing. Using that logic, \"Ya Got Trouble\" (\"right here in River City\") from the Broadway musical The Music Man is not music. 2. They don't even speak properly. Using that logic, folk music forms that have existed for centuries, many of which are sung in local dialects or slang and employ the word \"ain't,\" are not music. 3. There is no melody. Rappers often perform in certain cadences that suggest rises and falls in pitch. While that may not be considered \"melody\" it's certainly musical in approach. If calling it \"melody\" kills you, then consider it \"rhythm.\" Still music. Is traditional African folk music that employs nothing but chants and drums not music? 4. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes. Define what a \"3rd grade rhyming scheme\" is compared to the apparently more elevated 4th grade, 10th grade or even post-graduate rhyming schemes. Whether it's in grade school or college, a rhyme is pretty much a rhyme, and there's not a bunch of leeway about what makes words rhyme. They do or they don't. Furthermore, explain how Kanye West rhyming \"sarcophagus\" and \"esophagus\" is 3rd grade in nature. That's just the most obvious example, there are many others. 5. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought. If that were true, and it usually isn't, that would suggest all art needs a generator and a terminus of rational thought, which is ridiculous to expect from 100% of the art ever made, possibly 50% of the music. (It's not even reasonable to expect that from life.) And it would render instrumental music pointless. Stream-of-consciousness is a valid poetic and writing form; rapid-fire, stream-of-rhyme rapping is therefore valid as music. Can you explain the complete thought behind a single Jackson Pollack painting? Can you write me a three-act synopsis of John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme\"? You can't; the art is the thought itself. Sometimes it gets topical, sometimes it's sexual, sometimes it's ridiculous. Every single genre of music adheres to (or is freed from) that construct. The only pieces of art that require a step-by-step narrative that begins and completes entire thoughts are how-to books. 6. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop I think you mean \"8-bar loop.\" But that's not fair either. Most pop music is built on consistent patterns that repeat throughout the song. \"Surfin' Bird,\" \"Hound Dog,\" the entire legacy of 12-bar blues is based on a fairly strict blueprint. I think what bothers you is that they use pre-recorded samples, but there's even an art to programming and using them. 7. They don't even play the instruments. Leaving aside that there are a bunch of hip hop artists that do play their own instruments -- watch The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and you'll see one such group every single weeknight -- then anyone who just sings and doesn't play an instrument isn't music to you. \"But their voice is their instrument!\" you might say. But then you'd be forced to admit that rappers' voices are their instruments as well. You haven't spent enough time listening to rap. You don't have to, of course, but if you want to assess the music from any point outside of your seven rather bad ones, there's a lot of rap you can listen to to disprove them. You might have to dig deeper than the stuff you hear on the radio, but it's there. If it makes you feel any better, people have been using the same old arguments against rap as you do for about 35 years now. (See also: historical arguments against rock and jazz.) I'll defend your right not to like rap, if you defend my right not to like Kenny G. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Music Noun Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion Above is the Oxford Dictionary definition of music. Now let\u2019s see if the definition applies to rap. Vocal or instrumental sounds: Check; all rap has vocals in it, hence the term rapping. Most raps are over a beat which involves drums and bass. Last I checked, they are considered musical instruments. Form: Check; rap is generally structured. Many rappers use various different rhyme schemes in songs, which is what form is. Any rap song may also follow the pattern of verses and the main chorus Harmony: If you ever listen to Kanye West, you would know that he incorporates a lot of harmony into his music. West is not the only one; there are various rappers who put harmony in their songs with the instrumental background. While some rappers do not, this does not necessarily disqualify them as harmony is subjective to all people. Expression of emotion: Rapper Nas was famous for his story-telling. Eminem was also really great at story-telling but on top of that, you can hear the emotions that he spews when he raps. His songs can range from sentimental to angry to craziness and his emotions are reflected in them through the way he conveys the song.  So basically, in conclusion, rap checks off all of the criteria of being music. Many people listen to it and just because others do not like it does not mean it isn\u2019t music. Rap is music. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all RAP is an overarching name for a multitude of approaches of putting words to music. and YET its only one part of HIPHOP Second of all theres a composer who wrote a piece thats 4 minutes and 11 seconds of silence and people continually put on that concert. There are composers that play noises at random intervals. or at time intervals but with no melody at all. So if talking in rhythm isn\u2019t music to you then you might want to rethink what music actually is. However, rapping isn\u2019t talking. There are pitches, and those pitches are as important to creating the overall sound as the rhythm. Take Eminem. on some songs he has that high pitched growl. on other songs he goes lower. Some rappers are basically scatting. look up Busdriver- Even Jay-Z his voice is not monotone. it communicates emotion. Melodies in lyrics have gotten smaller in order to make room for other things, like groove, complex instrumentations, and even the ever popular Hook in which songwriters drive home a point so that it imbeds into your brain. You probably don\u2019t know every classical song by heart. maybe you do but more likely you just remember a few repeated bars. dun dun dun dunnnnn you know that. so modern songwriter s capitalize. does that mean its not music? hell no. its more about the mainstream getting more obvious and to the point in order to make money. but ART in all music, including rap still exists and IS being made. There are some rappers who can bring you to tears if you let them. Just as an Opera singer can. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know are theatrical plays a form of entertainment or art. Is poetry really a literature format?  I can only assume that you are not a student of the art form from the generalizations you've made.  1. Usually rap songs combine a \"hook\" or background vocals that would qualify as singing. There are many rappers that pair with R&B singers, which would disqualify this point.2. I guess this is subjective. You are not a grammar king my friend, so I don't know how hard I'd throw that stone. But, to address your point, \"they\" tend to have a higher command of the English language than people give them credit. Can you tell a story that rhymes and expresses emotion over a beat? I'd highly doubt it. It's incredibly difficult. If you haven't tried it (I have), I wouldn't dismiss it so quickly.3. Rap music is all melody. Melody is defined as, \"a sequence of single notes that is musically satisfying.\" 4. I guess you'd call Shakespeare 3rd grade reading, so I can't really argue there. If you pay attention to the syncopation of vocals performed on a rap album, and the genius way that some rappers put words together, I think you'd change your mind.5. See #2. What kind of rap songs are you listening to? I bet you're basing this entire arguement on radio rap. I'd encourage you to school yourself a little. 6. Typically, no. There aren't only 8-second loops used as background beats. Yes, some songs use 808s and loops, for sure. But, you'd be discounting groups like The Roots, Tribe, De La, J5, Brand Nubian, Wu Tang, etc. And you'd be really discounting producers such as Dilla, Guru, Primo, etc. 7. No, actually this one I agree with, usually rappers don't play the instruments. But, there are thousands of singers that don't play the instruments either.  I think this was a good post to encourage conversation. When you don't know the history of an art form, and only can judge it on its radio-version, it's a bit tricky to become a fan of it...or at the very least, respect it as art. ",

            "answer_text": "Merriam-Webster defines music as: a. the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity and b. vocal, instrumental, or mechanical sounds having rhythm, melody, or harmony Vocal sounds having rhythm, melody or harmony. That sounds like rap to me. Now with the comments you made for the question, I can sense some, shall we say\u2026biases. We can trace the origins of rap all the way to the griots of Africa (primarily western Africa) that have existed since time immemorial. A griot is the keeper or oral tradition among tribes, often accompanying music. A practice that would come with the captured Africas to America and find a place among the slave culture. This would go on to influence blues a great deal. In the 1970\u2019s DJ Kool Herc began having \u201cback to school\u201d house parties in the Bronx which led to the DJ and quickly MC driven rap explosion that started in New York City. This would lead to Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. Then would come Run-DMC, MC Lyte, and Public Enemy, among many many others. Before long, rap moved to the west coast, and we saw the rise of the West Coast rappers like N.W.A. Ice-T and later the late greats; Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. (I also need to say here, personal disclosure, I have everything Tupac recorded, so my opinion may be biased). The rest is history, a history that many of us are at least familiar with. Rap music is often a response to societal challenges or injustices faced by African-American communities and individuals. This is displayed by N.W.A.\u2019s famous \u201cFuck da Police\u201d which is a direct criticism of the police brutality that characterized living in Los Angeles at that time. We see similar poetry put to music through Tupac\u2019s music, Biggie\u2019s music, Jay-Z and many of the lesser known rappers that populate the up and coming scene. This poetry is about deeply personal things that effected them and the reality of life that many grew up with. It\u2019s gritty at times because life was gritty. Some of the best music in the history of the world comes from places of great emotion or great obsession. Do you think that Mozart wasn\u2019t obsessed when he wrote his symphonies? Do you not think that John Lennon wasn\u2019t angry when he wrote Revolution (later credited to both Lennon and McCartney)? Of course they were. Don\u2019t you think that Tupac was moved when he wrote Dear Mama? Listen to the words of that song:  You don\u2019t think this is a man that loves his mother? You don\u2019t think that this is a man that recognizes both his mistakes and her mistakes and acknowledges it as part of the human condition? How about Keep Ya Head Up?  In which he says: I wonder why we take from our womenWhy we rape our women, do we hate our women?I think it's time to kill for our womenTime to heal our women, be real to our womenAnd if we don't we'll have a race of babiesThat will hate the ladies, that make the babies Further on in this song Tupac laments that there is money for war, but not for feeding the poor. How can you question if this is music? Every time I hear this song it gives me goosebumps. This is a masterpiece. As socially relevant as anything the Beatles ever wrote, and as impactful as anything every produced by Aerosmith (overrated) and talks about the real world in a way that many genres of music can\u2019t even approach. Let\u2019s take a lightspeed jump to today\u2019s music. Now, we can make fun of Kayne all we want. But the fact is, take all his antics away, the dude is a musical genius. I\u2019m convinced he could write a beat with killer lyrics on pots and pans. All of the Lights:  In this song he says: \u201cI made mistakesI bump my headCourts suck me dryI spent that breadShe need a daddyBaby please,Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (all of the lights) \u201cCan\u2019t let her grow up in that ghetto university\u201d this is about a man acknowledging mistakes and working to improve himself. He wants to provide for his daughter, and he knows he messed up when he hit his partner, that it was wrong (and domestic violence is horribly wrong) and even though her family, possibly rightly, hates him. You said in comments that the rhyme schemes are simplistic. If Tupac\u2019s, N.W.A.\u2019s, Kayne\u2019s, Jay-Z\u2019s, Nas\u2019, or other rappers beyond count are simplistic than so is Poe. The voice can\u2019t be an instrument? It can\u2019t be impressive. Ha. Ha. I present Tech N9ne\u2019s Worldwide Choppers:  Yeah, if that\u2019s not impressive contemporary (Busta\u2019s using stuttering here was brilliant) music, I don\u2019t know what is. Better than the manufactured dreck being produced by Katy Perry or Nashville in general. Plus you have the fact, beyond all the lyrical meaning and expression that goes into rap; it\u2019s catchy. Listen to some of the music I\u2019ve linked in this answer and try not to move a little. It makes you want to move. I can\u2019t listen to rap and not move, it makes me want to dance, or box, or other things\u2026. (Tech\u2019s \u201cCaribou Lou\u201d, I\u2019m looking at you) Are some of the lyrics violent? Yes, they are. These men and women frequently lived in violent environments that inspired what they\u2019re seeing. AC/DC wrote about being hitmen (\u201cDirty deeds done dirt cheap\u201d) and Springsteen sang about serial killers (\u201cNebraska\u201d). Are some the lyrics misogynistic? Yes, unfortunately. So is rock. Guns \u2019n Roses had a song \u201cIt\u2019s so easy\u201d whose meanings are better left undiscussed. Neil Yount wrote, \u201cEvery Man Needs a Maid\u201d. Korn had several so much. Not to mention the general behavior of Aerosmith, GnR, and hair metal bands without number (and mainly without talent). Misogyny is a societal problem, and it is being tackled in very real ways in contemporary society. However, rock music had its female stars, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane/Starship, Janis Joplin. As did country in Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, etc. Rap and hip-hop, for all its male-dominated culture, had many female artists that were revolutionary. The aforementioned MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Monie Love, Salt-n-Pepa, and of course the vocally powerful Lauryn Hill. Not only have women been able to participate, but they\u2019ve been powerful people in the industry. Music makes you feel, it invokes an emotional reaction, it makes you move. Rap does all of those things, therefore, it is music. The established norms of music didn\u2019t recognize jazz at one time, yet it had a massive part in influencing later genres of music. Same could be said for rock music, it was viewed as culturally revolutionary, hell Elvis Presley was viewed as indecent. Rock wasn\u2019t accepted by \u201cestablish norms of music\u201d either. Many people thought it lacked composition and was just noise. yet it had a massive cultural impact. The norms of music constantly change, there is no standard norm of music. Anything that uses melody, rhyme, and composition, that invokes emotion of some kind, is music. Or can be music. Yes, rap is music. ",

            "answer_text": "I count rap as music. And that comes from a happily married Asian female with a couple of advanced degrees and 6 professional licenses and a couple of teenage kids and a Trump supporter in my late 40\u2019s. Never got section 8 housing, medicare, food stamp when I first got to America. And yeah I started from 6 feet under not even on the ground floor. Believe in limited government and don\u2019t believe in welfare. Did I leave anything out? So in terms of creditability I think I have some brain cells to tell whether something is music or not, agreed? Let me repeat it again: rap is music. I am not your typical rap music lover as you can see (after having read all the nasty comments here about this genre I am just saddened how closed minded ya\u2019ll are) Asking \u201cdoes rap count as music\u201d is like asking this question years ago \u201care African slaves humans?\u201d Let\u2019s see, based on the definition some years ago this is a human:  And this is not humans, they are called \u201cslaves\u201d  Because their skin is darker, they don\u2019t wear the same clothes as the guy above, They don\u2019t wear a white wig, so they must be \u201csub-humans\u201d. Now in 2020 looking back at the definition of what constituted a human back then we can all relate. Heck, as late as early 1900\u2019s these guys below were not seen as humans having equal right as the first guy above.  How about these ladies? They were not seen as humans having equal rights as the first man up there until 1920 when the 19th amendment was ratified.  So given hiphop rap is the late child of music being only 40 years old, it is understandable why it will take some years for it to be \u201crecognized\u201d as music. It will go through the same struggles as those people above (except the white guy in a wig above) to be seen as a ligit form of music by bigots like ya\u2019ll. I do hope that these comments stay up here on Quora for another 200 years and your great great grandchildren will have a chance to read what you have written today. They will judge whether you have a bigot against hiphop rap music and they will be so horrified to find out that their great great great grandparents were actually hiphop/rap deniers. Good job at leaving a great legacy behind people. Lighten up and chill. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think, hiphop rap is here to stay and it has been the most popular genre since 2017 and continues to dominate the charts for many years to come. Rap overtakes rock as the most popular genre among music fans. Here's why. And as of 2019 3 Most Popular Music Genres of 2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Why does it have to be music? Why can\u2019t it be poetry? Which is what it is Please don\u2019t get me wrong, since rap is mostly about lyrics I have a 4 octave voice and have done vocals for years, and singing is one of the hardest jobs I started out as a Bach pianist at age 4 I started playing those rigid Catholic Roman Damian type of church music with multiple part harmonies at age 15 I played in jazz bands Played professional worldwide, where my only source of income for 10 years was music And rap is not music whatsoever It is categorized as poetry Of course, you can have a poetry album and then a sudden music number, where the main focus of the song, being vocals, is done with a melody, rather than in a poetry format The same is true with Acapella, which would be a group of vocalists singing without music  So when these guys sing a tune without music, vocals being the main focus, it\u2019s music because the vocals are based on a melody. The moment, they switch to a song that is rap and no melody, then it\u2019s not music; it\u2019s a poem uttered with rhythm. And if that is music, then we\u2019re all in trouble. There are many branches of music that are packaged and sold so the record labels make money, but have nothing to do with music and rap is one of them While this could be entertaining, it really has nothing to do with music  If you were to add some rap to this, it would still not be music If you added some instruments instead of rap, then it would be music because we would have a melody as the MAIN FOCUS of the song If you added instruments and a rap, then the rap would take the MAIN FOCUS of the song and it would not be musical but poetrical But what is wrong with a poetrical group that is entertaining? They are wonderful because they are TALENTED poets But we can\u2019t destroy the music industry by replacing TALENTED MUSICIANS with TALENTED POETS. This is why the music industry is getting destroyed What was considered a joke, is talent now Why? Because non-musical formats have taken over music so much that people forget what music or singing is about. So when some joker starts squealing like a pig, people go WOW dude, he can really sing. I realize I\u2019m going overboard, but we\u2019re at that level and you know what I\u2019m talking about It is wrong to push for new music so bad that we forget quality music. Isn\u2019t it better to listen to quality music than tons of new junk noises? It\u2019s time people started listening to old music from Bach to Stevie Wonder to Journey to Jazz greats and mix in new music here and there IF QUALIFIED It\u2019s time to listen to rap as a poetry But let\u2019s not replace music with rap (music with poetry) Just imagine if we pushed this so hard that our kids started rapping instead of taking piano lessons that keep them out of drugs and temptations It\u2019s a sad world when we destroy our own kids while trying to push our agenda ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no for a couple reasons. The first being that most of it starts with nothing more than electronic sound files making up the instrumentals. At least in most modern rap cases. The second is due to vocal content, again, only generally and not entirely. If we are to call this the music of a culture then you HAVE to define the culture. If much of it is about drugs, music or lavish things then we should look at the culture and ask \u201cis this what you're trying to convey?\u201d; I hardly find throwing money around for \u201cp**** and weed\u201d to be worth any kind of appreciation, and I will be the one to say that if that is going to be where I'm considered a racist then yes, I suppose I am. Because the thought of sex and flaunting money is, quite frankly, a disgusting thing to attach to something that is as important to humanity as music. Of course, when we look back to the 90\u2019s or some modern rappers who sing about politics, about family, about personal life and the like, that's appreciable. An instrumental on its own is considered music. From a similar point of view, I find it hard to call electronic music \u201cmusic\u201d, too. That overproduced electronic instrumental simply detracts from the whole of music and its construction. But for rap\u2026it's more or less music until it's bitches and hoes. Then it's outright silly and more of a cartoon than anything. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll skip the pleasantries, if you don't mind. Frankly, I was expecting a much more reasonable shortlist of reasons as to why you believe it isn't music but there are two immediate issues I can see here: You're free to believe hip-hop isn't music but it /is/. It's an established one at that with more than 25-30 years of unique history and progression to support the immutable fact that it is indeed music.Rap isn't so much a genre as it is an element of hip-hop. Hip-hop music can be instrumental as well. Rapping is something that one does. It's a verb, primarily. I'll expand on this later.Now then... addressing each of your points one-by-one: (They talk instead of sing) This is of no consequence. If you consider the genre of punk, there were a lot of vocalists that didn't sing in the traditional sense at all and a popular example of this is Sex Pistols' God Save The Queen. Hardly any singing throughout the track, is there?Didn't stop punk from being established as a subgenre of rock, did it? Thought so.(They don't even speak properly) As pointed out in one of the answers before mine, African American Vernacular English (or AAVE) is a dialect within English. Usually when someone says \"Speak properly!\" to black people, it comes equipped with a distinctive history of bigotry behind it. In other words, it is a demand to black people to be more like the majority racial demographic (in this case: Caucasians) rather than you taking a step outside of your comfort zone to learn something new about a culture you are ignorant about.  Contrary to popular belief, ignorance is quite a natural thing because no one can know everything otherwise there'd be no point in learning anything. However, when someone such as yourself parrots the already unfounded \"points\" as a reason to reject a rather valuable cultural offering like hip-hop, you end up appearing wilfully ignorant and coming off as rather obtuse.  Remember: everything has history, including your \"points\" detailed above.(There is no melody) I don't think melody was an issue when music first came about in the form of chanting and when melody was first introduced in the form of polyphony, there was a bit of a resistance to embracing it because of the then-established traditional norms. However, things progress and things change and old ways can be reinvented into creating new things. Hip-hop absolutely thrives on this principle, especially when you consider the sociopolitical climate that the genre was spawned in. More on that later.(They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes) \"They\" is a bit broad. Be more specific. There are countless emcees (also called rappers) that have proven to be some of the most skillful wordsmiths known to humankind. If you don't know any of them, then that'd be your own fault for not knowing more about the genre you're criticising here.  That said, sometimes complexity isn't necessary when making a good/great track and this kind of approach isn't exclusive to hip-hop. Consider any subgenre of rock, (yes, even technical metal) pop, or even country-western. You needn't always go over the top to make an impressive tune or showcase your musical ability... unless your main intention is one-upping your peers.  Speaking as a musician, there are plenty of people who do but that isn't always akin to making good art. It's more of a clich\u00e9.(They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought) This \"point\" is probably the biggest indication that you aren't listening to hip-hop with the intent to learn.  Like many poets, there doesn't always need to be a complete thought in order to express oneself on the mic.  Sometimes, imagery is all that's needed. Again, this concept isn't exclusive to hip-hop so I'm quite baffled that you'd use this as a specific criticism.(The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop) Another example where rock comes to the fore as an example of where this never mattered, nor did it hinder rock's rise to prominence in music.  Lots of bands play variations of the same chords and riffs from not only other tracks they've created but tracks other bands have created.  Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit is an awesome song and the most recognisable bit is the riff which is effectively repeated over and over (\"Here we are now... entertainers!\").(They don't even play the instruments) Again, depends on who \"they\" is. Emcees don't usually produce tracks and producers don't usually rap but there are some whom are multi-skilled and therefore do.  One of the greatest bands in history is a hip-hop band called The Roots. All of the instrumentation is live.  If you're criticising hip-hop for not always having live instrumentation then you'll need to extend that criticism to pop, all of electronic music (dance, house, trance et al), and anyone who performs a capella.Moral of the story: you either haven't thought this through or you're asking this question just for the sake of garnering some attention to this thread.  If it's the latter, you've succeeded. Well done. I hope you learned something. ",

Music doesn\u2019t have to have singing in it.They often (but by no means always) talk/rap in slang, so the way you are viewing their speech is probably similar to the way a lot of Jazz musicians would have been viewed in the early 1900\u2019s.\u2026what?Listen to a little bit of any semi-decent rapper, a good example is K-Rino\u2019s track \u201cAstronomical\u201d.I\u2019m sorry, Lil Wayne does not make up the entirety of rap, Listen to Immortal Technique, Lowkey, and even Eminem.It\u2019s called a beat for them to rap over, and loads of songs use a repetitive beat, they just change small parts to make it sound interesting.Neither does Adele. The point is rappers rap, producers produce. Often they just sample beats but lots of producers do make there own completely original beats.I mean actual rap isn\u2019t necessarily music, but when you said rap I assumed you meant Hip-Hop and the deriving genres. Rap is just a common aspect of the genre Hip-Hop, which doesn\u2019t necessarily have any rap in it. It\u2019s just a style. Finally \u201cthe established norms in music\u201d, what does that even mean. Music can be whatever you want it to be, there are no established norms except from \u201cmust be audible\u201d I suppose. Music, in my opinion, more than any other art form is completely free to be whatever it\u2019s creator wants it to be. Otherwise music would quickly become stale and dull. Had you been born a generation or two earlier I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be saying \u201cdoes rock and roll really count as music.\u201d ",

Will someone who appreciates REAL \u201cmusic\u201d please verify that I've spelled \u201cmusic\u201d correctly? Is it double quotes or single? Or just \u201cair\u201d quotes?) although it sounds as though you're a true connoisseur of \u201cmusic\u201d, so I wouldn\u2019t attempt to argue with you about what \u201cmusic\u201d is. I would imagine you only listen to the very best, most stirring, skillfully crafted, and compellingly timeless \u201cmusic\u201d available to mankind. I mean, only someone who would take the time to craft such a thoughtful, discussion worthy, evenly balanced and opinion free query such as this would HAVE to be incredibly well versed in creativity, artistic expression, and the myriad forms of \u201cmusic\u201d from every corner of the globe. Honestly, I would defer all questions about \u201cmusic\u201d to you, Professor. You are arguably the best suited, since you have obviously studied all forms of \u201cmusic\u201d and their respective components, as well as learned the history and subtle nuances of every subgenre of \u201cmusic\u201d and the geographic and socioeconomic influences imposed on the creators of \u201cmusic\u201d and the subsequent affect of the factors reflected in the output of said creators. No one is better suited to explain to us what exactly \u201cmusic\u201d is, and how or when any particular type of it will end. You are the Rhodes Scholar here. So please, aside from your particular favorite type of \u201cmusic\u201d (obviously the best, because I mean, it's YOU, right Doctor? That \u201cmusic\u201d is destined to become someones wedding music I imagine), when will it die? ",

            "answer_text": "Take a look at these lyrics: It drops deep as it does in my breath I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind Is this a poem written by someone famous, perhaps? Someone who gets their names in literature anthologies and poetry collections? No, this is New York State of Mind by Nas.  Rap music is music. It\u2019s poetry, delivered differently. Let\u2019s note, of course that I am talking about the lyrical rap music. Back when rappers, and singers for that matter, actually needed a scrap of talent to get by in the industry. Gangsta rap is not considered music by many, because they are offended by the obscenity and the language. Rap music also lacks melody most of the time, and most people don\u2019t like this. Straight Outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube From the gang called Niggas With Attitude When I\u2019m called off, I got a sawed-off Squeeze the trigger and the bodies are hauled off You too, boy, if you fuck with me The police are gonna have to come and get me When this song was released, it shocked many Americans and they decried it as too violent, too gritty, too disgusting. Rap music is also misunderstood, in part, to the heavy slang words used in the lyrics. Below is part of Raekwon\u2019s verse in \u201cCREAM\u201d by the Wu-Tang clan. I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side Staying alive was no jive Had second hands, moms bounced on old men So then we moved to Shaolin land A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, Lo\u2019 goose Only way I be getting the G off was drug loot And life started like this, son Rolling with this one and that one, pulling out gats for fun But it was just a dream for a teen who was a fiend, started smoking woolas at sixteen And running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes Making my way off fire escapes No question, I would speed for cracks and weed The combination made my eyes bleed No question, I would flow off to try to get the dough all Sticking up white boys in ball courts My life got no better, same damn Lo\u2019 sweater Times is rough and tough like leather You might get the gist of it, but most of this likely would make no sense at all. \u201cGetting the G off\u201d? So far we have violent imagery, angered lyrics, and heavy slang. This, plus the fact that most rappers dressed like the sort who you\u2019d expect to find in a jail cell, blew up the stigma that rap is not music. But if you look closely, most lyrical rap music is a cry for help. Straight Outta Compton radiated fear from every pore, and while everyone condemned its language and violence, many didn\u2019t realize that perhaps Ice Cube and NWA wanted you to be afraid, to see the world as they see the world and to pull you down from your high horse. And many rap songs have heartbreaking lyrics, if you listen closely. My homies dying before they get to see their birthdays These are the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth I know that ain\u2019t the truth, sometimes I look for proof I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto, and if it does, does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz? Remember how it was? \u2014Hold On Be Strong, 2Pac I try to keep my head up, and still keep from getting wet up You know it\u2019s funny, when it rains it pours They got money for wars but cant feed the poor They say there ain\u2019t no hope for the youth And the truth is, there ain\u2019t no hope for the future \u2014Keep Ya Head Up, 2Pac Lyrical rap is real music. It\u2019s only that the information gives you problems (real problems) presented in a different manner with unfamiliar lingo. And sometimes, the truth makes us uncomfortable. And now I\u2019m like a major threat Cause I\u2019ll remind you of the things you were made to forget NOTE: Mumble rap is not music because it involves literally no talent at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What is and is music is entirely subjective. Also evidence may be needed to support what established musical norms are, otherwise your claims can be easily written off as hyperbole and exaggeration. 1. They talk instead of singing. If we take singing away from music is it no longer music?If we add talking does this make it less musical? 2. They don't even speak properly. By that logic I think we an write off most of country and western as \"not music. Phill collins (s-s-s-sudio anyone?) and the these guys;   3. There is no melody. There is melody in all talking, unless you have a monotone voice. Most good rappers use melody in their delivery. Example; are lil way, jay Z, Eninem. 4. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes. Example; Eninem, kendrick lamar, royce 5 9, frequently use multi-syllabic ryhmes. 5. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought. I'm not really sure what you are trying to communicate here. 6. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop Looped music is still music. Example; John Cage, Brain Eno, Steve Reich. 7. They don't even play the instruments. Irrelevant. Music is still music regardless of whether its performed by a musician or played via a system Example, John Cage, Music Concrete, Midi Files. ",

One of them, possibly second most known, Bulat Okudzhava - Wikipedia, was rather categorical on the terminology - \u201cit is not music, it is a way of performing your poetry\u201d. It doesn\u2019t mean they had no melody and no guitar accompaniment. They were about as musical as early Bob Dylan. If Dylan was singing in Russian in USSR, he would be considered a singing poet rather than a musician. A combination of powerful, meaningful, deep rhyme and rather basic melody with mediocre vocal would be classified according to the strongest element. Would Dylan be interesting if his melodies and vocal were combined with Ariana Grande\u2019s grade lyrics? Unlikely. Would his lyrics be worthwhile without any melody? The Nobel Prize Committee definitely thought so. So where it leaves Rap? Well, I cannot imagine a culture where Kanye West (musician) is not a musician. However if say Eminem was singing in Russian in 1960s-1980s USSR, he would be unquestionably seen as a poet influenced by Vladimir Mayakovsky - Wikipedia, rather than a musician. What I am trying to say, what qualify as music is culture-specific. Which gives us an easy answer - in English-speaking world, Rap is called music, and therefor is music. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I completely count rap as music. I used to think otherwise before I truly knew the genre, but now no one could tell me otherwise. Firstly, many people say rap isn\u2019t music because no one is singing, their simply \u201cspeaking\u201d now rap is totally different and I hate when people say it\u2019s just them speaking but I\u2019ll get to that later. So rap isn\u2019t music because there\u2019s no singing. What about songs that are purely instrumental? I highly doubt anyone would say songs preformed by an orchestra without any vocals are not music. So one of the main arguments for why rap isn\u2019t music doesn\u2019t work at all. Back to the speaking thing. The vast majority of people can speak, why aren\u2019t we all making millions off of it then? Because rapping isn\u2019t the same as speaking, not at all. Singing is definitely not speaking in many people\u2019s eyes, especially if they believe rap isn\u2019t music because they are \u201cspeaking\u201d and not singing. Singing is really just dragging out syllables in cool ways. Rapping is very similar in how it sometimes drags out, twists, and alters syllables, all while still clearly saying each word correctly. This is done to create creative rhyme schemes in which that may not even rhyme at all sound like they rhyme due to a flawless delivery. Now there is something I need to say tho the people who don\u2019t consider rap music and most likely don\u2019t like rap. There are many types of rap and one is most recently becoming ridiculously popular despite the fact that most music fans detest it; something known as \u201cmumble rap\u201d. It\u2019s gotten to the point that it is almost always referred to by this name by people who know what they\u2019re talking about. The second point is referring to \u201cregular\u201d rap, the artists most people would know that are quite lyrical are: Eminem (my opinion most lyrical rapper), Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G, and Nas.

            "answer_text": "Does rap count as music? Does hip hop count as music? I had to take a few minutes just to let the question sink in and make sure I wasn\u2019t being trolled! Seriously though yes, it most certainly does count as music, well in my opinion anyway. Over the last 30 years I\u2019ve listened to different styles of music alongside hip hop and they have all died along the way except rap music. I live in England so in the early 90\u2019s my mates and I fell in love with the rave scene, that was the main music we were bumping but we still had time for N.W.A. The grunge scene erupted around the same time but burnt out very quickly. Mid 1990\u2019s was all about bands like Oasis (collectively called Brit-pop but I hate that word). We listened to plenty of English bands but still had Biggie or Tupac on, then as the 90\u2019s drew to a close the one and only Eminem appeared. This was around the time I just started listening to rap music and nothing else. Since the 1990\u2019s ended there hasn\u2019t really been any big movements musically, I don\u2019t think pop punk or emo were big enough but there was rap music still going strong and outliving some of the greatest and biggest scenes ever in the industry. To the untrained ear it might sound like some guy or girl just talking over a beat, with some piano and maybe strings thrown in. Sometimes the music might sound a little bit daft (The Real Slim Shady can sound a bit ridiculous and I have had to defend it to friends that are stuck in the past). However people that are into rap music know how much love and work goes into making the beat, the piano, strings, any samples, scratching etc. And then there are the lyricists, wordsmiths whose brain seems to work on a different level to the rest of us if they have mastered their craft. Not only do they have to rap in time to the beat, it has to rhyme and say something you wanna hear. Then there are those that take it further, I\u2019m gonna use Eminem for this example. Simply put he can make 2 or 3 words at the end of each line rhyme instead of just 1 syllable that some use as it is easier. Not just that but Eminem tries to get words from earlier on in the sentence to rhyme. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the best, but I only used him as an example, other talented rappers can do it too. To the uninitiated it might sound simple to make a rap track but it is a real labour of love and a real craft. People have mocked me for listening to it and I just say \u201cYou try it. Come on write a few bars now\u201d and if they do they realise it\u2019s a lot harder than they expected. So, does rap count as music? You\u2019re damn right it does. A style that seems easy to outsiders to is very deceiving. A style that has outlived many other musical movements and scenes. A style that should definitely count as music (except mumble rap, keep that away from me lol). Take care everyone ",

            "answer_text": "A common fallacy in argument is to try to win by definition instead of by real argument.  If you said \"I think rap is not good music\" or \"...not interesting as music\" you could defend that far more easily than by saying \"it isn't music.\" It would also be more likely to spare you charges of racism/classism. And suppose it isn't music? A Rembrandt isn't music either. The movie \"Gravity\" isn't music, but music is part of it. A wind chime isn't musical but it sounds nice. And it isn't poetry, or product design either. Categories are necessary and convenient, but if you lean on them too heavily they become a straitjacket that separates you from really experiencing life.  Thus many rap songs combine elements of rap with elements of conventional song. Hard to say \"This part is music and that part isn't.\" George Anthiel's \"Ballet Mechanic\" employed a symphony orchestra and an aircraft engine. Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture includes cannon fire. Is it then to be classified as \"not music\" ?  A guy I once knew from an Arabic culture told me Western music wasn't music because the notes were so far apart they didn't sound like melodies to him (Arabic music is highly melismatic). An Indian classical musician I once knew said Western music sounded primitive to her because its rhythms were so childish.  I'm a sophisticated listener. My favorite music is J.S. Bach's later works (Goldberg Variations, Musical Offering, Die Kunst der Fuge), which are some of the most austere, cerebral yet spiritual music ever composed. And I'm familiar with most genres, around the world and through the ages. And I don't like most rap--especially the raps that are mostly crude braggadoccio.  But I've also found that the best music in genres I don't generally like is still worth listening to. Conversely, though I'm an opera lover, I don't enjoy probably the majority of operas--tedious piffle.  With rap, there are some works that I've found genuinely moving, such as Kanye West's \"Jesus walks\" :   And yes, I know what a jerkwad Kanye West can be. So was Wagner. Or Lauryn Hill's Everything is Everything:  ......which mixes song and rap. Or the intensely moral fable by Eminem and Dr. Dre, \"Guilty conscience\" :  ...which has no \"real singing,\" is often vulgar/obscene...yet which is a real work of art--and could make the world a better place if every thoughtless youth would take it to heart. It's a big world. ",

If you lived through the second World War, then you remember rock rising in popularity in the \u201850s, until it had all but drowned out classical music in the youth (baby-boomer) population, much to the dismay of the adults who had grown up on \u201cthe classics.\u201d Led Zeppelin scared the hell out of people who had listened to Sinatra their whole lives. Rock also came to be associated with the hippie/psychedelia movement. Flash forward 20\u201330 years, to the early \u201890s. A new type of music was being created, much different from the \u201cclassics\u201d our parents grew up with, and the \u201cclassics\u201d their parents had. This time, it was hip-hop, and due to it\u2019s introducers being in the \u201cgang scene\u201d, this is what it became equated with. Now every kid who listens to rap wants to drink lean, gangbang, and kill people. Right?! Flash forward another 20 years. Those kids who grew up on hip-hop have kids, and the new kids are listening to dubstep. It\u2019s so much different, with only electronic noises, and it\u2019s introducers did coke and molly at lightshows. Now, every kid who listens to dubstep wants to be deadmau5 and do drugs with a big mickey mouse thing on his head, right?! Times change, and music changes. Just because you don\u2019t like a particular music, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t music. It just means you\u2019re too ignorant to enjoy an art form you are unfamiliar with. Stick to your \u201cclassic\u201d Pink Floyd records, Grampy will stick to his \u201cclassic\u201d Sinatra collection, your son will stick to his \u201cclassic\u201d Tupac Shakur CD\u2019s, and in a few years your grandson will have an iPhone loaded with \u201cclassic\u201d dubstep singles, and everyone will be happy and enjoy their own music.

I\u2019m not a fan of country or ditzy pop. Have no need for it to go anywhere even when I\u2019m out a ways from the city and those stations are all that\u2019s left on the radio, I just roll my eyes and connect an aux cord. When I am back in the city without a trusty aux cord, I wind up inundated with the terrible pop version of rap music which to me is even worse than 99% of country pop..which incidentally sometimes has some rapping in it. In fact, country musicians were \u2018rapping\u2019 for quite a while before some Bronx kids did a similar thing that became Rap. \u201cTalking Blues\u201d  This isn\u2019t to say you\u2019re a country fan. It\u2019s just to say that while the actual genre will continue to be called or be rap. And as the music gets more spread across the global culture stuff like this happens:  While this isn\u2019t terribly terrible, this is;  Which impales my heart with visions of murder far more than fake-gangster sketches of rappers like Lil whoever. I prefer rap that has more depth and particularly older;  Where rappers speak clearly even if its a mouthful of slang, thoughtful lyrics and even if its about terrible subjects it\u2019s good. Considering I also listen to stuff like this;  And still have yet to commit murder I would say lyrics are only important if you are already a psycho to begin with. So yes. Rap music is here to outlive us and rest assured, what ever comes next both you and I will be shaking a cane at those little runts and telling them how real music was back in our day. ",

Quora is merely a long list of opinions and that\u2019s all. None of the answers are the tell all end all! With that, the person that posed this question clearly does not like Rap Music. Nothing wrong with that! It is His Opinion! I don\u2019t particularly care for the Rap/Hip Hop Genre either, but I am open minded enough to appreciate the fact that it IS a form of art that was introduced and found a following. It would be similar to that of Grunge, or Rock & Roll or Classical for that matter. The kids of the era call it their own and will go down in flames fighting for it, just like the kids from the past. I believe that the decade in which you spent your youth plays a huge role in what type of music or media you choose to delve into. Kids that came of age in the 40\u2019s went for Jazz, the 50\u2019s went for Elvis and Very early Rock & Roll. The 60\u2019s More Rock & Roll with the Beatles. The 70\u2019s brought us Arena Rock which was to later become known as Classic Rock. The glorious 80\u2019s, Heavy Metal, the 90\u2019s Rap & Hip Hop and Grunge. 00\u2019s to current, Bubble Gum Music with the Disney Girls and Justin Bieber and so on and so on. What will be interesting is what the future brings to the kids of their day. Whatever it is, chances are that Rap fans will probably care very little for it and have their opinions. Every Genre of Music has it\u2019s fanatics, it\u2019s detractors and it\u2019s critics that will say that it isn\u2019t this or it isn\u2019t that. Regardless, if it is what moves you, enjoy it. Also, lighten up on those that dare make their opinions known here. As we don\u2019t agree with them, there are just as many that don\u2019t agree with ours! ",

Blues is music. Rock is music. Drum circles are music. - - - - - - - - - - - - - The drum solo of \u201cIn-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\u201d is music. - Hell\u2026 A beatnik reading poetry over bongos playing is even music. What qualifies? Any artistic use of sound to engage the listener. It doesn\u2019t need to have lyrics. It doesn\u2019t need to have melody. It doesn\u2019t even need to have a predictable pulse. It just has to be sonic, take up some time, and elicit a response. Judging by the extreme strong feelings I\u2019m seeing in these posts, Rap is possibly the most virulent form of music to ever exist! Do I like Rap? Not particularly for the most part. However, there are some things like \u201cHeavy Mental\u201d by Killah Priest that I find absolutely brilliant! And a lot of music by Gorillaz (if you can call that Rap, some isn\u2019t quite Rap\u2026) is enchanting. On the other hand (completely different side of the musical spectrum) I find music written by Chopin to be forced and disjointed\u2026 often lacking in a smooth metered pulse. - It just leaves me cold. - I rather prefer Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and to a lesser extent, Bach and Wagner. - However, there are literally millions of Classical music enthusiasts that truly love Chopin. I\u2019m just not one of them. Bear in mind that typically, I like rock (term used broadly)\u2026 - Albums by Cream, Santana, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, Deep Purple, early Black Sabbath, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Soundgarden, Clutch, Modest Mouse, Tool, and quite a few singles by many others. - I also like Ragtime, 1920s Jazz and a great deal of Fusion Jazz, but not 1950s Jazz at all. - I like quite a lot of Bluegrass and really old country like Hank Williams Sr. (but not Jr. at all, and not much new country either). And I like quite a lot of the 1960s Motown songs. And some classical. But not modern pop. Anyway, most would say my taste in music is pretty diverse. I once knew a professional pianist (and this guy loved Chopin!) who had project with an ensemble that did some extremely experimental music. Bicycle wheels tuned to melodies and spun while a guitar pick was held against the spokes. Trumpets played into a bucket of water. Compositions where everyone was in a different key and time signature. Some was quite appealing, but some was just totally lost on me. However there was this one piece another pianist did\u2026 It was literally ONE NOTE! And occasionally also a higher or lower octave of that note. It began slowly with a gentle repetition of the note. There would be pauses\u2026 Then stronger hits of the note\u2026 Then much stronger. It went up and down in dynamics for a while, then it wound down and finally ended. ONE NOTE! - When it first began, I thought the pianist was joking, pulling some sort of avant garde nonsense. But by the end I was mesmerized! The feeling it left me with was one of great release and hopefulness. ONE NOTE! But it had the ability to touch ones\u2019 soul. Regardless of how minimal it was, it was truly music. ",

There\u2019s rarely an actual melody, and chanting doesn\u2019t count as \u201csinging\u201d. But it keeps a steady beat, which is a defining attribute of music. Typically we think of music. as composed by a musician, for specific musical instruments arranged in a cohesive, flowing medley of sound. Rap doesn\u2019t meet this standard, as quite a bit is merely someone shouting or muttering crude, unsophisticated pseudorhymes without literary merit or the complexity required to convey subtlety and nuanced emotion. Furthermore, it is frequently based upon sampling and re-sampling the work of genuine musicians. Musician, of course, defined as \u201ca professional who has studied the art of, and acquired a demonstrable mastery of one or more standard performative musical instruments.\u201d However, the fact that it maintains an identifiable and steady beat, accompanied by some form of personal expression, however crude, vulgar and poorly articulated, does indeed allow it a dubious, yet valid claim as \u201cmusic\u201d.

In this sense rap is the truest form of music there is. Even traveling minstrels in old Europe rarely sang because they couldn't. \u2018Modern\u2019 norms even accept it as music. Those who do not subscribe to a strict European perspective of music that even Europeans reject. In fact, classical music is a homogenized, simplified version of all the other music of the world. Very few musical systems are limited to just 12 notes and if you calculate the cycle of fifths properly you find that it is infinite and never ends on an octave. You don't even have to calculate it in fact. The fifth is 2/3 the frequency of the root, the octave is 1/2. There is no mathematical way to turn 2/3 into a number that matches 1/2. So Westerners said \u2018Forget this, it's too hard. Let's make it 12 notes and end on an octave\u2019.

No. They recite (not sing) the words that are written for them by producers; in much the same way that musical singers do. The difference is that musical performers have talent. Modern day rap is just as much a factory production as other forms of pop music. Other people have mentioned how varied and smart the rap producers are for stealing bits and pieces of other more successful works and recombining them into a mosh mash of discordant noises. I am not talented in music production, but sometimes I feel I could do better. Is rap music? Technically, yes. In reality, most often the answer is no.

There are also a lot of percussionists who could mount a fairly sound argument. They use 3rd grade rhyming schemes. I'm going back to large swaths of Gilbert and Sullivan, and pretty much all of pop music, from Elvis to whatever the hot sounds are today. They use words to rhyme but not that complete a thought. As opposed to the sophistication of Abba?  Gilbert and Sullivan?  Judy Garland?  Popular music isn't necessarily the best forum for deep thinking. The \"music\" is on an 8 second loop As opposed to Beethoven, whose works don't repeat much at all. They don't even play the instruments. Ignoring those who do, consider that most performers lip sync in public, because they don't want to worry about screwing up when people have paid them a ton of money to watch.  And when the music takes a minimalist tone, why hire a full orchestra? Obviously, I hit on Gilbert and Sullivan (and classical music) a lot, here, because nobody would question that it's music. What you really mean to say is that rap doesn't focus as strongly on the aspects of music you enjoy.  Trust me, it's not a new complaint.  There are versions of this (phrased as \"it's not really music\") dating back hundreds of years to bash some of the most famous composers.  Jazz, blues, and rock weren't music.  Punk, metal, and grunge weren't music.  Unless music is only what you like, you have to learn to be more inclusive. ",

When people say it isn\u2019t music, they\u2019re only trying to delineate some form of music that they happen to like as being \u201creal music\u201d, and other music as \u201cnot music\u201d. Which frankly, is a form of snobbish self-deceit. It\u2019s like saying that burgers are \u201cnot food\u201d. What the blazes are they then? Plasma? Mineral formations? Animals that happen to have randomly died due to suffocating between two pieces of bread? Some people are into this kind of half-joking snobbishness. I just find it irritating, since it can make having a meaningful conversation on the topic almost impossible. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Duh. Of course rap is music! You ask: WHY? We'd have to go back almost four hundred years in the study of Western Musicology, and I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU/WITH YOU (I literally went to school for this), but something tells me that's not what you\u2019re going for. We'll go back go the early 1900\u2019s instead, in France, Louisiana, and the night clubs of Harlem. In France, a couple of weird dudes were experimenting with early audio recording technology and were asking questions you clearly never thought to ask but that Patrick Star of SpongeBob might have sooner asked: \u201cIs a train whistle an instrument? Is Mayonnaise an instrument?\u201d To prove this, they recorded a loop of a train whistle, and dubbed it to be the earliest form of electronic music, called \u201cMusique Concr\u00eate\u201d or \u201cConcrete Music\u201d due to lacking a distinct rhythm or any prior professed \u201cattributes of music\u201d, since the sound didn't come from a traditional musical instrument, but from a mode of transportation.  If you take umbrage with this classification for instruments, you take umbrage with classic Americana pop song \u201cThe Leader of the Pack\u201d by the Shangri-La's, which features the revving of a motorcycle as a percussive element in the chorus.  Meanwhile, in Louisiana, Dixie music and Ragtime were being formed by black American musicians around the same time as those two weird white dudes in France, basing their instrumentation on a combination of classical era rules of composition, with additional syncopation that was less noted in classical music than in rag time.   A few years after, based on slave songs in the south as they travelled north to take on new life in the north and south, gospel music was born on the east coast, country and bluegrass music to the south, and 12 Bar blues to the north in the club of Harlem.  Hey, doesn't this sound like that one song?  No, the other one\u2026  Wait, they're all\u2026 The same? Yes, that's the idea of the 12 bar blues: it's a very specific, easily calculated formula based on note lengths, note pitches descending in succession, before jumping high, then to a middle range before going back to the bass notes, in a very specific, easily tracked way over 12 measures. By the 1950\u2019s, this music would evolve to Big Band and the progenitors of swing based loosely on the origins of gospel singers and the 12 bar blues.  The one thing uniting all of these musicians besides the fact that they were all black Americans, is that the polyrhythms commonly expressed in the melodies and rhythms is highly complex and is a staple of distinctly African music (I learned that one in ETHNOmusicology, I cannot anymore highly recommend you take BOTH courses if you can: SO informational!). Whether in the Caribbean, the heart of Africa, or the heartland of the U.S.A, black musicians have intuitively participated in a beautiful, musical heritage, tradition, and inheritance, and pushed this tradition along to the modern day. (Phew!, Now let's look directly at rap!) Listen to any rap or hip-hop based song. Tap out the rhythm for the supporting drum line with one hand while tapping out the vocal rhythm with another, and tap your foot to the tempo of the song.  I haven't asked you to do anything impossible: professional Drummers manage this tiny miracle feat of the human body every day they work. Look at how different every rhythmic section is from each other. These are the remnants of the African polyrhythms that have followed black musicians and their families across centuries and oceans. MIMS does the audience a lovely favor here by clapping the tempo directly for our less knowledgeable listeners, giving us a template to follow. The clap is likely a sound effect, the concept borrowed from those crazy French dudes almost sixty years earlier, utilized in a rhythmic way as a helpful percussive element to ground the listener and give them a foundation they can relate to. Now, observe the digital backing melodic ostinato in the background. The electronic instrument has a pure, almost whispered timbre like a soprano voice gently hooting in the background. The melody of the ostinato starts on one note for three even quarter note counts, raises to another pitch playing for three quarter notes counts, lowers to a different pitch for three quarter notes, before lifting high for six equally even quarter note counts for six counts. Fellow sound engineer Adam Neely recently detailed the ostinato of this song in a video commenting on the truly atrocious verdict against Katy Perry's Dark Horse recently. You can start at 5:28 in his video and he'll briefly bring it up shortly after.  That being said\u2026. This is just one example of a rap song that has engaged in a rich music tradition spanning centuries, and innovations spanning almost a hundred years, back to the time of 20th century art music and rag time. The complex use of polyrhythms, the syncopation, the melodic complexity! You know what I'll argue was NOT music? These awful covers by this church choir!  ",

It lacks Melody, harmony, and timbral range. Very few, next to zero, rappers write their music. It is appropriated for them, written for them, or sampled by them, but rarely ever comprehended for it's technical qualities. There are exceptions. Bone, Rhazelle, Kanye and others cross over from merely chanting or speaking, and choose what tones to produce or which should carry their message. Rap alone, however, is not music, anymore than an auctioneer calling cadence is music. It may have musical qualities, but it is not music (usually). That being said, rap songs ARE music, and that matters little, since it's popularity has, in recent times, eclipsed all other forms of song in popularity. Rap is changing the world In a further aside, it is easy to remember how the spell rhythm wigh the acronym; Rap Has Yet To Help Millions. ",

One of the reasons rap came about was because that under President Reagan\u2019s leadership public school funding was cut drastically. One of the first things to go was music classes in those schools. Inner-city youth had no access to guitars or saxophones, drums or pianos. So they used the tools they had: Turntables and voices. I think there\u2019s something beautiful about that. Kids found a way to express themselves artistically, they refused to be put down. That\u2019s called resilience. And they sang about what they knew, the things that were happening around them. What else were they supposed to sing about? Rap is music. If you can\u2019t hear it as music then you don\u2019t understand what the word music means. You\u2019ve decided that a particular art form must adhere to your preconceived notions of what that art form is. But all art forms must have the freedom to grow or they die. There\u2019s room for all kinds of growth, you just have to allow it some space. And the space is there. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry It just doesn't have legitimacy compared to music. It simply has too many words that drown out the other parts. Words are the main driving force and any beats in the background are there just to carry the words. Rappers aren't singing. They are rapping. Society is running out of ideas for music. Music is a driving force for record companies to make money. They have to come out with something and that something is rap and homogenized pop. Musical ideas have become exhausted with millions of musicians trying every combination of notes and melodies over the centuries. Rap is the end result of what's left. There will be no more Bachs, Marvin Gayes, Jimmy Pages, Miles Davis, Tony Iomis, Paul McCartneys. Sorry to sound depressing but it's the hard truth. Plagiarism pops up frequently. Led Zeppelin stole ideas from the great blues artists. If there were a lot of low hanging fruit left to pick, then rap artists wouldn't have any need to sample. Why are classical musicians always covering a classical piece? It's simply because almost all great classical music has been wrote. What is there left after rap? Those who grew up in the last half of the last century were blessed to be exposed to a rich soundscape of music. Songs set to electronic amplification which gave new life to musical ideas. It was a fertile period in which many young people today are discovering. Society is changing and rap and music in general will not be the driving force that it is today. Already gaming and visual entertainment have displaced disposable incomes. Home theatre is also an example where money has gone. Movie sales are down but TV series like Breaking Bad and The Wire are keeping people home. Technology changes where money will be spent. Personally I'm waiting for my first home robot. I know I got off on a tangent. I'm just giving you my thoughts of a bigger picture as a whole. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Just like throat singing and Gregorian chanting is music. Just because you don\u2019t utilize every aspect of music theory doesn\u2019t mean that what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t music. Some artists use melody over rhythm. Some use harmony over melody. Some use rhythm over either of the two. Rappers dominantly rely on rhythm for their music. Of course there is often some sort of chord structure or melody line that accompanies it; but it\u2019s not typically the dominant theme. The words, the flow, the rhythm is what makes rap music what it is. Speaking to a rhythm. There needn\u2019t be a melody or a chord structure at all sometimes. Often the rhythm is all you need to be moved or inspired. Many ancient cultures utilized rhythmic structures long before incorporating melody or harmony into their music. Rap speaks to that. It\u2019s visceral, grounded, human. Then there are the words. The spoken word can quite easily be defined as music. There is a lilting nuance to everyone\u2019s voice that is unique. Rappers tap into this form of expression and push it farther; sometimes to the extreme. The vocal phrasing and linguistic rhyming is often far more brilliant in rap music than in any pop or rock lyrics. When it\u2019s the dominant driving factor, you\u2019re going to focus on it more and therefore get better at it. The expressive force of rhythm and the technical aspects of linguistic communication come together to comprise the bulk of rap music. Sure, there are many rappers who are quite adept at using chord structures and motifs and melodies just like there are many rock/pop artists who are quite adept at using rhythms and complex rhyme schemes. Music has no hard line boundaries when it comes to the artist\u2019s expression. But one thing\u2019s for sure: Rap is definitely music. ",

            "answer_text": "We have rap music. We\u2019ve been churning them out for hundreds of years. \u201cRapping\u201d means chanting. We had our gu\u0161le songs. I suppose it\u2019s a form of music that will develop when you have a whole lot to say, more than might fit into the form of lyrics. We definitely had a lot to say. This was during the Turkish, Ottoman occupation of Serbia. We woke up one day to find ourselves kidnapped into the Middle East. Christians kidnapped into the Middle East. Not propitious. Of course, we hadn\u2019t gone anywhere, the borders had just shifted and there we were. Marooned within a harsh jurisprudence which did not allow us to testify against them in court. In other words, we had no rights they were bound to respect. This went on for 530 years. It is said that in the late 19th century the average British farmer, who was literate, knew considerably LESS about his own country\u2019s history than the average Serbian peasant knew about his, even though the illiteracy rate for us was about 95%. That was because of these songs. Chanted songs. Rap songs. They were so good that there were English scholars who went to the considerable trouble of learning our language just to be able to read the songs. They run the gamut from tragic to tragicomic, to playful, to sardonic. Generally, the sense of humor is on the wicked side. Most often they are intensely political, involving a defiant social commentary. A collection in English is available, compiled by a Chapel Hill professor, Vasa Mihailovich. Amazon.com: Songs of the Serbian People: From the Collections of Vuk Karadzic (Russian and East European Studies) (9780822956099): Milne Holton, Vasa D. Mihailovich: Books  He presents one of the last songs about Prince Marko. Marko started out as a superhero soldier who could kill 10,000 enemies in a day, all by himself. In this last one, he\u2019s nothing more than a sharecropper whose mother is nagging him to get to work plowing, so he goes out and plows the road. The subtext is that while on the land one is sharecropping, there are a few prohibitions about being assaulted. On the road, however, it\u2019s a road warrior environment where any Turk, or any Moslem for that matter, can do whatever they want, without censure, to any Christian Serb, who is to get out of the road, hat in hand and allow the real citizen to pass, hoping not to end up in a willow tree. Srbe na vrbe.  So, that\u2019s why Marko is plowing the road, turning it into his own turf wherein he has some rights. If this \u201crapping\u201d doesn\u2019t qualify as music, what is it? I guess it\u2019s merely a profoundly powerful art form. And don\u2019t forget, the original Christian services, as in the Christian Orthodox liturgy, are also chanted. Christianity grew for 1500 years, without any sort of literate body of believers, by way of . . . rapping. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is music. I understand what you mean: it isn\u2019t totally my favorite genre either, but it really still is music. Here\u2019s why: All music, on the entire planet, only consists of 3 elements: MelodyHarmonyRhythm.It is the interplay of these elements, that creates all the different genres. For example, if you make the rhythm bouncy (swinging), and you make the harmony complex adding tensions to the chords, you will invariably end up with something jazzy. If you use simple short melody lines that keep repeating, make the harmony very simple only consisting of 1 repetitive chord for example, then you have to make the rhythm busier or more interesting for it not to be boring\u2026 et voila: you have funk music or something that will come closer to having a funk or dance music feel. So music is this constant balancing act between these 3 elements. If the song is at a fast tempo (rhythm), you don\u2019t want a whole lot of chords. If the song is rhythmically really busy, you don\u2019t want a busy harmonic rhythm (the pace at which chords change). If the song had really complex, rich sounding chords, then you don\u2019t want a ton of them happening really fast after one another or you don\u2019t want a busy rhythm. At faster or busier rhyhms, you don\u2019t want really intricate, busy melodies. And so on and so on. So in hip hop: there is less melody, because the melody is taken over by the rapping. The rapping serves 2 things: it tells the story, ANDit provides a rhythm, as the rapper delivers he lyrics with a certain rhythmic flow and delivery that is unique to that rapper. Tupac for example, has an entirely different rhythmic flow than Eminem, who both have a very different flow from Snoop.The harmony is usually repetitive and not too complex. The reason for this is that doing otherwise, would distract from the usually busy wording, and the rhythmic flow of the rap. The rhythm(s) provided by the percussion/drums etc are interesting and layered, very often integrating various loops in the beat. So because of all that, yes it is definitely music. :) ",

You might as well say people who speak Chinese don't speak properly, just because they use a different lexicon than you.3. I would say all the auto-tune in rap music these days is considered a melody, even if it may sound terrible. But it still is music.4. I was going to reference a compiled list of too many rap songs that use past 3rd grade rhyming schemes, but you would have probably counter-argued that these rap songs were exceptions. So, I'm just going to tell you to look at all the rhyme schemes of pop songs these days and I think you will have answered your own question.5. I can't comprehend this6/7. Oh. So that means it's not music? I thought the elements that comprise music are \"pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture\" (Wikipedia: Music). These elements don't seem to have anything to do with how long each loop is, or who plays the instruments.User, I believe this question will interest you. ",

It\u2019s by no means a put-down. It\u2019s just an observation. Music has certain characteristics. The most defining of which is melody. Rap, by definition, has no melody. Rap is poetry.

            "answer_text": " As frustrating as this question is, before I say anything else, I absolutely must answer: YES\u2014rap \u201ccounts\u201d as music. Look up any definition of the word \u201cmusic\u201d and I guarantee it says something like \u201crhythmic organization of sound.\u201d Actually, wait\u2014I\u2019ll just look it up for you. Here are screenshots from what I just Googled:  (via What is Music? - Definition, Terminology & Characteristics | Study.com)  (via What Is Music\u2026Exactly?)  (via Definition of MUSIC)  Okay so none of them exactly said \u201crhythmic organization of sound\u201d but they all basically did. And if you don\u2019t believe me then go look it up for yourself. By definition, rap absolutely \u201ccounts\u201d as music. It has to count as music. It literally cannot be considered not music. Actually, I\u2019m willing to say that rap, more than any other genre, not only \u201ccounts\u201d as music, but actually epitomizes the definition of music through it\u2019s emphasis on repetitive sound patterns. Yes: I think rap is the most music-y of all music. Think about it: we\u2019ve clearly identified that music is defined by patterns of sound and that\u2019s what makes it so attractive to us. It\u2019s an innate human reaction to repeated vibrations. We subconsciously obsess over predictable patterns and for the most part, that\u2019s what music is. Of course, there are plenty of genres (like Jazz or Heavy Metal) that don\u2019t have a ton of repeating sound combinations\u2014which kind of explains why those aren\u2019t the most popular genres of music\u2014but are still considered music (and some pretty great music at that). Rap, though, is typically the genre with the most rhythmic patterns\u2014both instrumentally and vocally (and not by coincidence, either). That\u2019s probably why it\u2019s the most popular music in the world right now. Let\u2019s use Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cM.A.A.D. City\u201d as an example of a rap song that prioritize instrumental and vocal sound patterns. Here is the musical composition of the famous 2012 track off of his sophomore album g.o.o.d kid, M.A.A.D City:  Just looking at it, what do you notice? You don\u2019t have to be able to read music to see the constant repetitiveness throughout the entirety of the first hook and verse (and the rest of the song is structured the same way). This sort of instrumental repetitiveness simply does not occur at the same frequency in other genres of music. But to take it a step further and consider vocal patterns, let\u2019s look at the lyrics:  (courtesy of Genius.com) Read the first bar out loud (the first four lines of the verse). It\u2019s a simple AAAA end-rhyme scheme, but listening to yourself say it aloud, what else did you hear? Looking more closely, there are a number of other rhymes within each line to further enhance a rhythmic pattern. Aside from lane, cocaine, pain, and brain all rhyming, Lamar rhymes rap, crack, cul-de-sac, and Cognac together, while managing to squeeze in the rhyming \u201cay\u201d sound with major and weighin\u2019. Considering the simple fact that this verse is 32 bars long, and that Lamar keeps up (and actually increases) his pattern of rhyming throughout the rest of the tract\u2014all the while matching the instrumental pattern of the beat with his voice\u2014it becomes pretty clear that rap not only is an organization of sound patterns exemplifies musical patterns. Of course no one rap song is the same as the next. And there are plenty of rap songs that have far less instrumental and vocal patterns than Lamar\u2019s M.A.A.D. City. Still, the vast majority of rap songs have more organized and repetitive sound patterns than any other form of music\u2014inherently making it, by definition, the most music-like form genre compared to any other genre of music.  Thanks for reading :) I\u2019d love to hear any other thoughts comments! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it does. However, it is a music genre that on average lacks melody. If you like melody, do not listen to rap. In only very few occations there is melody in the words sung. The words are mostly sung through repetitive simple tones, which is why it was chosen as the most propagandistic music genre. It\u2019s very easy to spread messages by rap-talking, which is why rappers influence many young kids. It\u2019s very simple to make a rap song compared to other more classical genres or even rock and hard rock. People who say this is not true are just boldly lying. It just takes less effort and time, it\u2019s the pure truth. That is why I do not consider rap alone to be music as much as other genres are, effort and time are essential keys to make anything good. However, if you mix rap with other music genres, which is what used to happen back in the Old School days (Snoop, Em, 50, Biggie etc\u2026)since rap was more about adding this new way of singing to other existing genres, you can have musical masterpieces. Rap alone does not make a masterpiece. Too simplistic. Too lazy. Just listen to today\u2019s rap, British rap especially, which is what rap alone sounds like. Definitely not masterpiece because it is not linked to other genres. Of course there are some exceptions, but let\u2019s not turn exceptions into the case. ",

            "answer_text": "Is Rap music? Well I guess the answer is yes. Is it good music? Well that depends a lot on who the performer is. I used to love Young MC, Will Smith and a few less hard core kinds of Rappers. (Bitches and Ho's bitches and Ho's, Chocolate marshmallow and gramcrackers make smores) That kind of stuff I can live without. My youngest daughter got me listening to M&M. He is an ass. But a talented poet. Kid Rock\u2026what can I say? I often like his politics. My nephew Jamey Bennett known as Chun Jay in his group Royal Ruckus, he is a master of laying his life bare in rhymes. Now I realize that I just named the biggest three white rappers. So for the Rappers that are my absolute favorite.. Gangsta Grass. They got famous for doing music on the show Justified. They mix hardcore gangsta rap with bluegrass music overlay. I could listen to it for days in a row. There is even a \u201cMormon\" rapper James the Mormon, (not white) who is quite good and brings positive messages in his music (Even if I am a little offended by using the hate word \u201cMormon\" but it has a better ring to it than many other choices he could have made.

            "answer_text": "Those norms are largely bullshit. No, really! There is no one universally accepted definition of music. For instance: Gregorian chants are monophonic, thus they lack harmony and lack any form of accompaniment to the main melody. Percussive pieces lack both harmony and melody. The idea of music being a form of self-expression on the composer\u2019s part wasn\u2019t really a thing before the Romantic period. The idea of music being primarily an aesthetic phenomenon is inexistent in contexts such as ritualistic or ceremonial music. Unwanted music can rapidly devolve into noise, and pieces like John Cage\u2019s 4:33 are intended to make the listener perceive ambient sounds as music. The idea of rap not being music is sort of this conservative meme. It has no real basis in music studies, and is just an attempt to frame dislike, which is a subjective thing, into some sort of fake objective concept. Also, outside the oft-hated microverses of gangsta rap and booty rap there is a wealth of excellent music. For instance, try listening to anything that has Nujabes\u2019s name on it. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of ink is being spilled in answers that have good points but that do not disclose the linguistic groundings of the question. If shows how much unnecessary controversy can be created when questions are dropped without elaboration. First, the poster did not clarify if they want the answer to be based on some official definition of music or based on connotations around \u201cmusic\u201d. Without that clarification, different posters are inevitably going to \u201clatch\u201d onto different elements of language and argue into infinity. Second, establishing borders around definitions (in this case \u201cmusic\u201d) often seems to be a debate about good and bad (is rap music \u201clegitimate\u201d). But I hope the poster is not expecting the definitions of words to be insight into the reality which his question reflects. Third, if one considers the writing of Wittgenstein, most words carry a family of meanings. Consider the many meanings of the word \u201cgame\u201d. One implication of this is that the meanings of words (\u201cmusic\u201d) is only with great strife settled by emotional argument. Forth, I do not assume that the poster is being racially narrow in the question. I hope those who answer the question can see that the question can stand as legitimate in and of itself. However, I hope the poster is aware of the potential racial undertones of the question in light of history. Music is high value and even almost sacred in many elements of culture. ",

Listen to Rakim, Eminem, MF DOOM, Wu-Tang Clan, Aesop Rock, and countless other rappers to see how wrong that statement is.Also not true. Part of the craft within writing raps is tryna find words that rhyme together and make sense at the same time.A lotta music is the same basic chords or nots on repeat. That applies to more than just hip hop.A lotta rap beats are made using actual instruments so definitely not true.

As for putting rap down, musicians create a vacuum by turning their backs on young audiences. These young audiences want two things: Something they can do their own dances toSomething that speaks to the problems and issues of their time.Music of past generations is like getting hand-me-down clothes: to a young person, nothing makes them want to spew as much.

I love classical music such as Mozart and Beethoven, these geniuses composed such beautiful and emotional music. The ability to compose like they did to me is proof that God exists and we have a touch of God in our souls. Their music can give me shivers as it strikes an emotional response in me. For me music must be passionate, not necessarily the lyrics but the music itself. I also love the work of Hans Zimmer, his compositions are stirring both spiritually and physically. Interstellar, Gladiator, and The Last Samurai are some of my favorites. Pirates of the Caribbean is more physical, the bouncy, comedic tunes stimulate laughter and connecting with the pirate life as seen in the movies. John Williams was my first favorite composer with Star Wars. The movie swept me away as a teen and gave me an appreciation for classical music. My mother also loved classical music and she took me to the symphony often. I dont want to give the impression that I'm a snob, music touches us in different ways due to age, culture and upbringing. It may be strange but I also am a big fan of Metallica. They are a very passionate band and have created some terrific music over the years. At the heart of some of their music is a hum that I can feel in my chest. It is a very physical type of music for me. It touches the parts of my soul that has endured heartache and sadness but also the passionate side of me. I like to dance to Metallica and hard rock it helps me to express the more animal physical side of me. I don't like country or pop music either these kinds of music the lyrics are very important as they tell a story. I have a friend who likes music but she has never experienced a shiver of pleasure with it. All music expresses humanity in their own personal way, it is a gift from God. ",

And I can tell you what you are stating is rubbish and based on your subjective opinion to this genre. Is death metal music? Is hardcore techno music?Is Goa music? Are the works of Debussy considered music? They do not contain melody.  It is okay if you do not like the genre, but dismissing it as music would be the same, if some one did not like music from Impressionism era, would claim Debussy works are not music. I am not fan of rap, but I guess what Eminem does is rap, and I promise you that is music.  You make it sound like they just talk, using the rhythm and feeling it, to rap is a very hard discipline, and not any one can master it.  I is very disrespectful to the artist, that you dismiss their art form. ",

Words without a tune is not music it is poetry. And before people start calling me racist, jazz is music and includes some of my favorite music. Blues is music and underpins most of the popular music from my favorite era. Rap, spoken poetry, can make a great addition to a song, whether it's Debbie Harry, Big and Rich or Aerosmith.

The most holistic definition of music I can think of is that it is the organization of sounds through time. Given this definition, yes, rap is absolutely music, because it is the organization of sounds through time. Simplistic rhyme scheme and \"improper\" speech do not factor in here. They are still sounds, just like the 8-second loop of music that is not actually played by a human, and can be organized and synergized with other elements and sounds to create a whole, which is unquestionably and quantifiably a piece of music. Whether one can appreciate it is another matter entirely, but that does not subtract from its intrinsically musical qualities. ",

The most clear example can be thinking about how greek poets used to \u201csing\u201d their poems. It was not music, but poetry accompanied by a music background. In my humble opinion it completely reflects todays rap music being not properly music, but a fusion of the latter and poetry. And regarding the most upvoted answer that puts the entire discussion down to racism and nescience is just silly, considering the fact that those stats can't be proven real having no actual verified sources and, even if real they can't show the opinion of the whole american population, but just the thought of a limited sample.

By definition (vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion. or the written or printed signs representing vocal or instrumental sound.) rap is a form of music whether others disagree or not. I saw another commenter say \u201cThe \u201cmusic\u201d is on an 8 second loop\u201d. But that\u2019s just not true. Look at any rap song that the rapper Dave from Boyinaband had created. If you listen to it the music he had created is different throughout the songs. This person also said \u201cthey don\u2019t even speak properly\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t even play instruments\u201d. Neither of which are accurate. First of all, they do speak properly. Look at Dave again, where he speaks perfectly understandably and fluently. Second, this person also said \u201cThey talk instead of sing\u201d. They may be CLOSER to speaking than most genres of music, but they to alter their voice to go along with the rhythm they created. And Last of all they DO most CERTAINLY use instruments. Most may not use the classic forms of instruments such as guitars, pianos, etc. but they still use electronic musical instruments. ",

Actually, being a rapper is not only reading lyrics with flat tone or with high speed. They play with words by using many homophones and synonyms. Each one must have their own intonations called \u201cflow\u201d. Speed of singing is only a part of that. That is why you can differentiate when a Rap song is sung by Eminem or Lil Wayne or Chris Brown\u2026etc. However, Rap music is considered a new genre because it was born much later than the others.

When you say the word \"snow\" to a Alaskan, what pops into their head is very different than the same word spoken to a Floridian, so the sentence \"Do you enjoy snow?\" is actually two different questions when asked to the two different people.

            "answer_text": "I strongly disagree with your points here. Many people tend to delegitimize rap and hip hop lyrics simply because of what they hear of mainstream radio hip hop. It's crucial to remember that music radio focuses on heartbreak, love stories, and party life, including drugs, women, and money. Therefore, uneducated people make the assumption that hip hop isn't musically diverse and complex. There are actually so many different forms of hip hop, thus creating different styles of the music. Concerning your part about instruments, several hip hop artists grew up playing some sort of instrument, usually the piano. And others became masters of producing beats and sampling. So much thought and time goes into creating the melody of hip hip songs. That, however, does mot mean that they are incapable of creating they're own beats. Think of it this way, hip hop is like a puzzle and the artist's job is to find the perfect pieces. ",

In the extended version the lyrics are ludicrous (the radio edit doesn\u2019t fair much better) and to me that ludicrousness set the tone for nearly all rap to come; all the boasting, braggadocio, bullshitting about sexual prowess, fetishising of guns and gangster culture - it all leaves me stone cold.

Beauty of form is subjective but I think enough people would argue rap is beautiful. At least that's clearly the intention. Rap (especially good rap) uses harmony all over the place.  Lastly, rap is often emotion heavy and speaks to its audience. ",

I don\u2019t like Baroque music for the most part, but love the Brandenburg concertos. So what ? Baroque IS universally considered music. We even have examples etched on the voyager space probe, to represent music of Earth. You don\u2019t have to listen to it, like it, or buy it, (I don\u2019t) but it is music. BTW, your \u201cpinky\u201d is a finger. Anything else ? ",

They will think \u2018If lil pump and tekashi 69 made why not me?\u2019 There's no respect to the music no more. Because hey! All you have to do it talk! The other thing is our rap legends. When Eminem gets older and dies that may jump start more interest in it again! This happens with alot of artists. The thing is rap was supposed to have died when dubstep came out, but these bastards managed to evolve it and give it life again. Well the decade of 2020 may not be so nice. You see people may not want to believe it but I think we have hit the upper limits of music creativity. With dubstep. It defies all rules, goes anywhere and everywhere. It defied and destroyed all conventional thinking. What else is left? Nothing. Without the help of new sounds rap will not evolve next time. This is the end for rap. I want to say by 2030. Everything should be... Or has to be very different by then. The other way that there can be a guarantee that it will end is when it becomes normalized even more in society. When our mothers, fathers and grandparents start to rap. That's when it's a sign of the end. It becomes tacky. ",
