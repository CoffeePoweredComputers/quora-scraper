            "answer_text": "There is not really much, because around 80% of the world\u2019s population are still heavily embroiled in one of the major religions. You have to really consider the scope of what major religions such as Christianity did here, when they rolled over the world in a frenzy of bloody crusades and Inquisitions. By rolling over all the continents of Earth and forcing people to convert to a Christian belief system (often through bloody torture), the whole religion has basically stolen all of the true bards away from their own natural cultures, and caused them to conform to a Christian theological viewpoint in an act of most brutal tyranny. Therefore, how can there be much great secular music, which is as beautiful and touching as religious hymns? After the 1000 years of oppressive expansion to all four corners of the Earth, all of the great bards are still Christians! Only once a lot more people are getting free from the spell of belief will there be able to be a new generation of new, touching music which is irreligious, because first all of the descendants of the people who composed \u201cSilent Night\u201d and so on have to get away from religion. When Christianity rolled over the planet Earth, it stole all of the bards and composers away from their natural cultures, and so those people lost their own natural voice in order to then compose music according to what Christians say is right and superior. In fact, we have so little irreligious music that has been carried over from ancient days \u2014 mainly, it is only the music of the Celts which has managed to stay alive. How many great songs do you suppose we have lost, however?  Such rare songs as this are about all that remain from the old bards, before Christianity forced every person to conform into a Christian viewpoint, and from then on create Christian music. So obviously, while the vast majority of all people are still not capable of freeing themselves from Christianity, there will be very little music which is great and touching and irreligious, because there will not be enough great composers who are irreligious.

            "answer_text": "Amazing Grace, Oh How I Love Jesus, Sweet by and by, The Old Rugged Cross, How Great Thou Art, etc\u2026.. These are examples of sacred hymns. The difference between sacred hymns and secular hymns is very simple once you know what to look for. Even some of the good hymns listed above can be turned secular depending on how they're arranged and played. Music is made with three parts : melody, harmony, and rhythm. Mankind is made with three parts : body, soul, and spirit. Secular music first speaks to the body (rhythm). Whereas sacred music first speaks to the spirit (melody). If the music you listen to or are playing makes you want to dance or move your body then it is secular and not sacred! If you want to worship God with music you have to consider the three parts of music and have them in the right order. It's not enough to have good music with bad lyrics nor is it enough to have good lyrics with bad music. Be sure you have good music with good lyrics that Worships God first - - not just makes you emotional. If you want a good example look up Pembina Valley Baptist Church and watch their live stream on Sunday or Wednesday. You might even see me in the choir haha. ",
