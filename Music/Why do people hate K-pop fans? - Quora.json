            "answer_text": "people hate things they don't understand\u2014 or to put it simply, a lot of communities are crazy xenophobic and misogynistic and take it out on us. kpop fandoms are compiled of mainly women. i am a trans man so i am merely a small percentage of bts' fandom, army. kpop fandoms are a female-dominated space, and often times women's interests are (unfortunately) made fun of. this is a major factor as to why everyone makes fun of kpop fans. many women in one space, all supportive and passionate over something that brings them joy, dwindled down to simply \"obsessive teen craze over asians dancing\" which is not (always) the case. i will admit, some aspects of kpop are annoying, like fancam culture. however, i'd take a fancam of an attractive asian person dancing and singing over a racist joke on groups that deserve respect.

            "answer_text": "Because \u2026 as talented and refreshing kpop can be compared to the more explicit western music, kpop caters to the fantasies of fans. Meaning upholding and creating unrealistic expectations in their fans. If there is one thing I know koreans to be REALLY good at, its marketing. I mean its just fascinating how kpop didnt even used to exist 40 years back and now kpop is a popular choice of music today all due to how they are marketed by koreans. The perfect, trendy groups with amazing visuals singing the most catchy songs and dancing to the latest. Korean excell at putting their products out there. Unfortunately sometimes, for them idols get turned into those products. Kpop is a brutual industry with dark secrets, and when that gets exposure, the fantasy bubble fans have gets popped, mostly korean fans (netizens) go nuts and critisize the hell out of these human beings for ruining their dreams and fantasies of what kpop really is. Hell just breaks loose and bad things just go about in a vicious cycle creativing negativity over and over again. I have never seen a more stubborn grudge held by anyone other then kpop fans (no offense). This puts them in a extremely bad light. And don't even ask about the psychotic fans known as saesangs. Sure, there are fans like this all over the world but kpop is notorious for having them. Compared to western music, where everything reavealed and self expression is more evident, the fans expectations are mostly realistic. They realize that artist are humans, thye can date, they can do drugs, they can curse on live television and everything is fine. It never ruins their careers most of the time, its gotten very common. And thats why western fans are more chill. Sure it can put artists in a bad light, but they forgive, they dont hold grudges that long and care more about the content and music. Now that kpop is getting recognition, the world is watching them, and seeing how they treat idols and have scandals is slowly breaking that perfectionist veil koreans have put over product. And the brutal truth of the matter is we all want that perfectionism, fans expections have sky rocketed because kpop only makes it harder to have realistic expectations and you know what? Its working, it works, people will always buy what kpop sells because its a break from reality, its as far from reality as it gets, but cons of it is major backlash and the shame when shit hits the fan. And it will always evetually come to that point. I apologize for rambling, and I hope it answers your question. And also this a very specific answer meaning, not all koreans citizens are horrible grudge holding maniacs, there are many open minded people, and not all artisits are put out in such a fake away, I have seen genuine aritists and companies that care. I hope I have not offended anyone, this is only my observation and opinion. Thank you. ",
