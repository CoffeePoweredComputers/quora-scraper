Apple introduced their streaming service, Apple Music, a few years ago. Their iTunes Store still exists: it\u2019s what supplies music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, books and apps, to the various stores on the various Apple devices, and music to the iTunes app on Windows. When people get confused? Is where Apple have updated the operating system on their Mac range of computers. The new version of macOS is called macOS Catalina. In it, Apple has removed the iTunes app, and replaced it with: Music.app: which plays and organises your music collection, lets you buy music from the iTunes Store, and can access Apple Music, Apple\u2019s streaming service. TV.app: which plays and organises your collection of movies and TV shows, lets you buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store, and lets you access AppleTV+, Apple\u2019s TV service. Podcast.app: which lets you listen to podcasts. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple Music is pretty much iTunes on steroids, with extra bells and whistles. If you are happy with what you get with iTunes alone, it can certainly survive as your music library. I myself am a happy user of iTunes Match, an older Apple service that is still offered. For $25 per year, I have my entire iTunes library, which is currently more than 17,000 tracks, uploaded onto Apple\u2019s servers and made available to me on all my devices \u2014 without using up precious space on those devices. And I also get the ad-free version of iTunes Radio. ",

With iTunes, you can play \u2014 and add to \u2014 your collection of music, movies, TV shows, apps, audiobooks, and more. In other words, music is one function of iTunes. Apple Music is a music-streaming service, developed by Apple Inc. Users select music to stream to their device on-demand, or they can listen to existing, curated playlists. ",

Apple Music is Apple\u2019s streaming music service. It uses either the iTunes or Music app depending on whether you are using a Mac on Catalina, a Mac prior to Catalina, or a Windows machine. Apple Music can coexist with iTunes on any computer on which iTunes is installed. ",

As an Apple Music subscriber, all songs, albums, and playlists added from Apple Music will be integrated directly into your pre-existing iTunes library. You\u2019ll be able to add to any playlists you may already have and what was once \u2018iTunes\u2019 is now a generalized \u2018Music\u2019 app. Canceling the subscription will remove content added from Apple Music and leave your iTunes library in tact.
