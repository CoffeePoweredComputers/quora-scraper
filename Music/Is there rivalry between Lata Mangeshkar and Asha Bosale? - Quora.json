            "answer_text": "Rivalry is a strong word but there was certainly a fallout. Below answer is little lengthy but essential for better understanding of the situation between them. Firstly Lata is 4 years elder to Asha. Lata used to babysit Asha. But when Lata turned 13, their father passed away. Lata got busy with her career to earn for her family. In lack of a father figure plus no elder sister\u2019s presence, Asha seeked emotional support from outside of the family esp. elder men. She turned 16 and eloped with their 31 year old family driver Ganpatrao Bhosle, marrying him against her family's wishes. Lata Asha's mother went into an emotional shock. Their mother was an extremely conservative lady. Lata was furious on Asha and she remained angry for a decade. Lata said in her personal interviews that Asha never took her family in confidence about her affair thus breaking their trust. Fortunately their mother got enough emotional help from rest of the Mangeshkar siblings and slowly recovered. But Lata never forgave Asha. On the other hand, Asha's husband turned out to be a highly insecure and a jealous man. He would fight and even abuse Asha because he was jealous of her talent and her earnings. Lata has confirmed this in one of her interviews that he never allowed Asha to speak with anyone especially Lata and other members of her maiden family and music industry men. He used to be physically present during Lata Asha duets so that they would not speak to each other. He feared Asha's family members would persuade and influence her to leave him. This was one of the reasons why in her early struggling days Asha never got any help from Lata. She was simply not allowed to ask for help! Lata also admits to have regrets for not helping her sister when she needed her support the most. The abusive and insecure relationship of Asha and her husband broke when Asha had had enough. This time she got attracted to O. P. Nayyar who was 7 years elder to her. But he was already married and had kids. They were a hit singer-musician pair but O P Nayyar was promiscuous about his marrital relationship. Asha waited for him for couple of years but he eventually broke her heart. She was sad and angry. She swore to never work with O P Nayyar again. Asha has said that O P Nayyar never casted Lata into his songs but he used to get competitive about Lata\u2019s singing and the string of hits that she was delivering. He would consistently push Asha to sing better to complete with Lata. This definitely helped Asha to sharpen her own skills. O P Nayyar\u2019s chapter ended in Asha's life and Mangeshkar family took first step to reconcile with Asha, now that she had young children and was estranged from her husband. Lata Asha met and buried the hatchet. There are rumours that RD Burman acted as a mediator between them because Asha and Lata both respected him. Asha was in fact in love with RD and eventually married to him. Whatever the reasons are, all is well that ends well. Both Asha Lata now stay in same building on the same floor and there is a door between their flats. Both sisters have tea and lunch together. Lata and Asha say that they never verbally fought with each other. The anger stemmed from disappointment and heartbreak. Lata is motherly to Asha. Asha says Lata didi is great in age, talent and love towards family. She dedicated her life to her art and her family. Lata says Asha is like her first child and more versatile than her. When they both have such beautiful relationship, rest of the world can only spot the fake freckles! Meanwhile Lata Asha both have tea, every day, since they started staying together, for last three decades \u2026 probably laughing on the stories that people are wasting their time gossiping about \u2026 the \u201cso called rivalry\u201d between the two!

            "answer_text": " World of music is no stranger to the melody queen Asha Bhonsle Famous for playback singing, her repertoire is widespread. She has seen a career in the industry which is spanned over six decades. In 2006, she accepted that she has sung over 12000 songs. With many hit songs and awards to her credit, Asha Tai, as she is popularly referred to, will always be everyone's favourite. Asha Bhosle, the great singer is also the younger singer to another legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar.  The Mangeshkar sisters were inseparable in their childhood days. So much so, that Lata took Asha to school with her each day and when one day the teacher objected, she quit her studies. It would come as a shock that these beloved sisters grew estranged for many years. The two most harmonious voices could only spur sourness about one another. So what happened between these blood related sisters that they could not see eye to eye? Lata Mangeshkar started working when she was not even 14 years of age to support her family after her father died. Being the eldest one, Lata felt it was her responsibility to do so. Growing up she expected the same seriousness from her younger sister Asha. But Asha as she is, the rule breaker, had craved a different path for herself. 16-year-old Asha eloped with a man named Mr. Ganpatrao Bhosle, who was 31 years old then. In one of her interviews Asha accepted that Lata did not approve of her marriage, \u201cAt one time, the relationship was very adversarial and there have been periods of non-communication.\u201d Lata also admitted that she thought this alliance wasn't in the best interest of her baby sister. \u201cHe stopped her from coming to our house and he stopped us sisters from meeting,\u201d Lata had told in an interview to a leading daily. Asha had three kids with Bhosle but their marriage saw an unhappy end and they moved apart. It would appear that after her marriage ended, things must have turned better between Lata and Asha. But the scars ran deep. Lata had already outdone everyone in the industry and carved a niche by the time Asha was still struggling. During those days, Lata disapproved her close proximity with music director O. P. Nayyar. Nayyar who did not like Lata's behaviour stopped signing her for his songs and maintained a distance. Nayyar had once revealed, \u201cAsha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's Peddar Road, shared a maid. The maid's responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something wonderful for Asha to lose her vocal poise. Such was Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Asha that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own.\u201d In her quest to not be overshadowed by her elder sister's persona, Asha sang every song which came her way. Lata's top position made her choosy singer and she selected songs on the basis of composer, tune and lyrics. Apparently, insiders of the industry say that this made Lata a stoic loner while her sister with her extrovert nature became the lovable one. The rivalry became a constant trouble for musicians back then. They could not work with both of them and were forced to choose sides. The 1998 film Saaz directed by Sai Paranjpye, is reportedly based on their lives. When Asha was asked a question about this in one of her interviews, she chuckled, \"To have two women in long plaits, take a couple of incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time.\" But as they say, family always sticks around. After being away for many years the sisters did bounce back to their roots. It happened when the younger brother of the two sisters Pandit Hridayanath Mangeshkar decided to give awards to people who have contributed significantly to the music industry. The first recipient of this award was Lata Mangeshkar who received it from superstar Amitabh Bachchan. The next year, Asha was felicitated and none other than her Lata didi gave her the award. \u201cIt is the award named after my brother and presented by my elder sister. That is far more precious than all the money and awards in the world.\u201d We can't argue with Asha's claim, \u201cTell me has there been anyone who is as good as the Mangeshkars? Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle are undoubtedly the best. Source:The story behind the rivalry between Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar ",
