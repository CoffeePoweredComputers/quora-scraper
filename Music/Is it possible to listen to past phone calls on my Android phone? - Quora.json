            "answer_text": "No. Unless you have installed an app that auto records calls you receive. Please note that some countries and/or states have strict laws about recording telephone calls. Not even carriers have authorization to auto record calls. Even if they do, they will not want to record the calls. They have the capability, yes, but not the storage for it. Think of mp3 music file, a 5min high quality sound will have a file size of 4.5mb, roughly. So, roughly, that's about 1mb per minute for a single call. Taking 1 million subscribers, making 1 minute call per day\u2026 that's a lot of storage. And we have 365 days. A single carrier will have way more than 1million subscribers. Carriers do offer voicemail, it's is \u201crecorded call\u201d but it's a one way conversation. And it's also a value add service, meaning you have to pay for it. And there is a time frame for how long the call stays in the system. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes , there is a feature in major android phones that records the calls automatically both incoming calls and outgoing calls. The recorded call automatically gets saved in a calls folder with correct date time stamp as well name of contact/ or number from which call came in case number is unknown. So, it gets very easy to locate a call in that folder Thus, you can easily locate the recorded call and can listen to it as many time as you like. You can delete it or share it as according to your will. ",
