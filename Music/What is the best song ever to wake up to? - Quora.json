            "answer_text": "Oh that\u2019s a fun question. There isn\u2019t any single style or artist I always use. I do use music in the morning to get my mind and body running. Often I put on some live music on YouTube if I am sitting at my desk. I like to watch classic Grateful Dead concerts. Or I\u2019ll choose a playlist from Spotify or iTunes. 95% of the time it\u2019s a playlist I have made but sometimes I use one generated for me by the streaming service. Sometimes I go for harder edged rock if I need a quick and jarring jolt awake such as: AC/DC or Led Zeppelin. Sometimes I want to hear gifted musicians ranging from the blue eyed soul of Daryl Hall to the musical perfection of Steely Dan. Sometimes I have an upcoming concert and play that artist ranging from pop like Taylor Swift, country rock like Lady Antebellum, hippie music like Dead and Company, recent discoveries like The Revivalists, or new music from long time faves like Jack White. If I need to reminisce I may play Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Simon and Garfunkel, Van Morrison\u2026 sometimes I go for classical (usually something like Mozart).I explore great guitar players both famous or new discoveries like Lari Basilio. I often go for my comfort bands like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The important thing is to play things that suit your mood. Sometimes you want to fire your imagination or smooth your soul. Sometimes you want to blast yourself into a higher level of energy, or slow your mind down when it is racing too fast. For me I want music I need the foreground while I drink coffee, but once in a while I just need something I like playing in the background. My point is I don\u2019t think there are any rules. One person\u2019s preferences might not work for another. Your preferences one day may be totally inappropriate on a different day. To quote the Grateful Dead: \u201cwhen you get confused listen to the music play.\u201d ",
