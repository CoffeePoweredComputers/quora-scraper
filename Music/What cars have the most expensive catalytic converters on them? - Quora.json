            "answer_text": "I'm sure that very high end vehicles probably have the most expensive system. Vehicles such as Bentley, Rolls Royce, Lamborghini, Porsche and various BMWs comes to mind. Lately, I have been surprised to hear that the Toyota Prius system is quite costly and, (no surprise here), is one of the more popular systems to be stolen. There a many variables in computing the total replacement cost of a cat system. There is the actual parts replacement cost and then the labor to replace the system. These costs seen to vary wildly depending on how complicated the vehicle cat design is to replace. ",

Take the price of the parts and work, then add maybe $30,000 or so each ust for shits and giggles, just because. I\u2019m sure that other exotics would have similar pricing methodologies. I got a kick out of this - NAPA just inserts a car\u2019s name into a stock paragraph. No word back yet from NAPA on how much they charge\u2026..  ",
