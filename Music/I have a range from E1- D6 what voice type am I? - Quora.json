You seem like a name a seen before and answered \u2026. anyways its not wise to classify you now sense your under 20 , range alone doesn't make up a voice type in fact not all tenors go to the high C anyways, how do I know? Cause I have music sheets for tenors and the highest note I have seen was a Bb4 in English music and only on 2 songs out like 200 songs(classical music) just keep extending and working on range , however if you truly reach a c2 right now at your age you are going to be a high baritone or maybe a tenor with a extended low range ",

            "answer_text": "Erm, can't tell. For one, you state that your timbre changes when you hit the C two octaves below C4. One of the defining features of a voice classification is the timbre. Also, you didn't state a passagio. Your range doesn't dictate your voice type. Freddy Mercury was a baritone, after all. ",
