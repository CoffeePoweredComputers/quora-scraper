            "answer_text": "Complex question- let\u2019s break this into two parts Playing all the scales on the same Flute by just changing the finger positions or opening and closing of the holes on a single Flute. Here there is no fixing of the base pitch so you can choose any Flute.Fixing a pitch for eg C which in Carnatic would mean first 2 holes closed and Hindustani would mean first 3 holes closed and then playing all adjacent notes in the progression on the same Flute by keeping the base pitch the same. Here you can play maximum of 2.5 octaves keeping the base pitch same. So as the scale changes you need to change the Flute.The way a Flute is made in the Indian classical system is by setting it to a base pitch and then aligning the other notes on that progression. So you get flutes of all scales. So when you play Sa on a C medium Flute it is basically C on the keyboard, however Sa on a D medium Flute is D on the keyboard as the first note So in western parlance when you say scale of C or D, we actually change the Flute to a C or D to match that scale or pitch. However a c major scale can be played on the D Flute as well. Got your answer? ",
