            "answer_text": "Technically, you cannot download Spotify Premium. When you begin to pay for or start a trial of Spotify Premium on your account, the app on your device will gain the benefits of Spotify Premium (ex. ad-free streaming, song queue arrangement on playlists, on demand song playing, offline listening) the next time you connect your device to the internet and use the app. Spotify Premium isn't a separate thing from the regular Spotify app.  The method of downloading songs that Matej describes is illegal, and will probably be forced to shut down if widely discovered. One big reason Spotify was created was to limit illegal downloading and give more people access to the music they love.  If you do not wish to pay for Premium, you can still access on demand listening using the desktop app, web player, or by using the app on a tablet. To access this feature and the other benefits I mentioned on mobile devices, you need to pay for premium. ",
