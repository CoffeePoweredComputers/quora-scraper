            "answer_text": "C major is not more difficult than the other scales in a significant sense. It is not as if, having mastered all the others, the pianist goes, \u201cAh, drat; now it\u2019s time for the deadly key of C!\u201d But it is true that C presents a certain mechanical awkwardness. It is documented that Chopin as a piano pedagogue saved this scale for last, as a rule, for this reason. People tend to think, I believe, that C is easy because there are no sharps or flats to remember. But that\u2019s a mental consideration, not a mechanical one. If you extend an arm in front of yourself and examine your relaxed hand out there at the end of it\u2014 as if you were dribbling a basketball, say, rather than with the fingers all tense and splayed \u2014 you\u2019ll notice that there is a natural curvature or arch to the hand. It\u2019s the basic reason for doorknobs being round, or computer mouses having a curved upper surface. Because the key of C requires all white keys, and because those white keys are aligned along a perfectly parallel plane with no topology to it, the flat layout of the C-scale runs contrary to the naturally curved contour of the hand in a certain sense that D-flat major, with its ergonomically cozy interjection of a few elevated black keys here and there, does not. Since it offers no topology more interesting than that of the Kansas plain, the key of C is not very helpful in maintaining a relaxed hand position, especially when we start the work of passing the thumb under the other fingers to get up and down the keyboard smoothly. And so the analogy, though a little hyperbolic for the sake of clarity, is that scalewise work in C major is like trying to walk across icy pavement in tennis shoes; D-flat is a little more like a forest path free of wintry debris. The difficulty is hardly enormous, and the difference is not extreme. However, one does have to take a little care not to develop extraordinary tension in the physical apparatus due to the \u201cslippery\u201d surface. ",

            "answer_text": "Because proper technique demands an in/out and up/down motion when playing. Virtuoso pianists play on the outer edge of the keys where they are lightest so when they play a C scale there is a lot of motion required because the fingers are different lengths. If you play a sharp key scale such as B, since the black keys are already \u201cin\u201d the longer fingers are already in place to play the outer edge of the black keys and there is less in/out motion that is required. So, to play a C scale the virtuoso pianist would play the thumb on the outside edge, then come out and up for the index to land on the edge, out further for the middle, move the elbow and arm for the thumb to play the F while also coming out but shifting forward so the hand doesn\u2019t fall off the key, then repeat out for the index, out for the middle, then in for the ring and in for the pinky. To play the B scale, starting with the thumb out on the key, the index and middle are already on the edge of the black keys so all the pianist needs is up, there is little distance to move the arm and elbow to get the thumb on the E because it is literally right there if you rotate the elbow, then up and over for the next three black keys. Pianists who are not trained to play in/out and up/down will have no idea what I am talking about. It is all to accommodate the different lengths of the fingers. Many pianists are trained to curl their fingers to equalize them but that instantly creates tension which will show itself in the execution of the scale. Go ahead, curl and equalize your fingers on the keys or a table. Feel the slight tension? That will get in the way of fluidity. Many teachers think you need to build strength and endurance to overcome that weakness but all you have to do to overcome it is not do it. If you can\u2019t play a fast or even scale, most likely you are missing one of these movements. I strongly urge you to NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. If you do something wrong your can hurt yourself. There are ten movements that go into playing and ten movements you should not do. Missing one of having one of the wrong ones can hurt you. Find a competent teacher who knows what they are doing and relearn how to play. Otherwise, just do what you do and your own limitation will prevent you from injury. ",
