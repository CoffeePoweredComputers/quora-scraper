            "answer_text": "Hi dude! Well, to your question, I'd say no. See, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains had a characteristic sound which went well with their sludgy, alternative metal sound. William Duvall doesn't provide that edge, though they have pretty good album sales at present. If you say that Oli can produce the same voice as Chester, I'd still say that Chester knew what voice was suitable for the sound at work. Oli can become the vocalist for Linkin Park, but can never replace Chester. If you say that Oli is the next Chester, then BMTH will be hotly debated as the next LP. LP was, is and will always be LP. Cheers :) Bongo ",

He is really a good vocalist but still he can't replace Chester because Chester\u2019s vocal skills are really amazing. He can literally change his vocals from screaming to soft and vice versa within a blink of an eye. He was a legend. His vocals are beyond comparable with anyone. ",
