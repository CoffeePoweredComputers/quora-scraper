            "answer_text": "Could this song record more than 3.2 billion views on YouTube without this music video?  Clearly, this song could not be an international hit song without its music video on YouTube. In my point of view, the music video itself is not more important than the song. However, music video on YouTube is More important than a song in the era of Social media. Before YouTube and social media were available, there were MTV and other music channels. At that time, still, the song was more important than music video at that time because they were limited. However, music videos on YouTube can be exposed anywhere, anytime. It goes without boundaries and beyond language differences. How come a Korean dance-pop song can be viewed by more than 3.2 billion without any proper marketing and PR from the beginning? Psy didn\u2019t intend to promote this song overseas. He just wished for a big hit in the Korean market only. There was no English translation of the lyrics of the song, no PR and marketing activities for the overseas market at all when it came out. He just uploaded the music video on YouTube. That was it, and the rest is history. What I found interesting and surreal in the music industry is not a song nor music video. I found YouTube is a real game-changer in the music industry at this moment. Kids nowadays don\u2019t buy CDs, don\u2019t listen to the radio, don\u2019t watch TV, and even they don\u2019t google to search for new music. YouTube has everything for them. Seriously, YouTube is the real game-changer not only in the music industry but also in the search industry. Teenagers don\u2019t google it. They search it on YouTube, not google. They look up anything and everything on YouTube, and they learn new things from YouTube. Music is not an exception to this phenomenon. The view count on YouTube is now more important than record sales. In conclusion, YouTube made music video is more important than the song. If there were no YouTube, Gangnam Style by Psy could NOT be the international hit with 3.2 billion view count. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that the music video is more important than the song. Videos do present a picture of the song that the lyricist/composer/singer/video producer want us to see. However, I was listening to music way before MTV and music videos were even thought of and I had no problem visualizing in my mind what I thought the song meant. Besides, sometimes I do not like a video of a song that I like. I have always liked the song \u2018God Only Knows\u2019 by the Beach Boys. Just recently though, I was told about another song by the same name by For King & Country. It is beautiful and the video is great. The song is all about God\u2019s love for us no matter what and that suicide is not an answer to problems that seem insurmountable. The first time I heard the song \u2018Blue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u2019 by Keith Urban I was just stunned and thought it was such a great song and so different for him to do. I saw the black and white video of the song and was stunned again because it was just about what I had pictured in my mind. Then, I saw the YouTube video of Keith performing it at the 59th Grammy Awards and was stunned again. It is just a great song and so descriptive of a guy seeing a broken hearted woman and wanting to help her heal. Another great black and white video of a great song is \u2018Last Call\u2019 by Lee Ann Womack. It perfectly shows the viewer what the song is about. The video is so descriptive in black and white, if it was in color it would not be nearly as descriptive. The term \u201clast call\u201d is presented two ways in the video. The girl has him figured out now. ",
