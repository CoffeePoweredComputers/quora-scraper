            "answer_text": "Death is not the end but it's the beginning of another new life. Obviously I'm not telling this from my experiences :D. But I've spoken to many experts and listened many people whom I can trust on such topics. The reasoning was also logical. So everyday, we go through lot of experiences, and out of all those experiences, one of them is what we remember or think before sleeping. Every week, we go through lot of experiences, and out of all those experiences, one of them is what we remember or think before the Monday arrives. Every month and every year same exercise is repeated in our mind, consciously or unconsciously, before the next cycle begins. So there are some thoughts which stays like a \u201cthick line on a rock\u201d. And what's more surprising is that one thing which stays there in our head throughout our life repeats at the moment of our death and it just continues in the next birth too. In next birth, these thoughts are nothing but could manifest themselves in form of a craving to do something or achieve something or a desire for money/name/fame or they're some kind of aversion towards a thing or people that we don't want or we don't like. So either there's a desire or an aversion towards people or things. Each one of us have some unconditional craving or aversion towards few things from our childhood. If we have some unfinished tasks before death(which are actually only in our head only), then we end up taking birth again to achieve that unfinished business. On the contrary, people who do not have any thick line on a rock, they\u2019d be more calm, satisfied, happy in their next birth and might as well be reaching to enlightenment faster. Just an example, I always felt doing something for the poor people or doing something for the environment at the cost of my time. None of which is related to me, specially the poor people. If you think deeply about your past years(NOT past birth) and recollect those moments when you felt something which was so sudden could as well be from last births. So that is one possibility of what happens after death. Another is the enlightenment which happens during the life to break this \u201cchain of births after births\u201d and keep performing Karmas and developing more and more desires. Once you attain a state that you've no desires for anything on this planet,even one should not be desired towards enlightenment. Just living an equanimous life with no craving and no aversion and accepting the present moment as it is. This will lead you towards enlightenment and hence you won't take birth again but go in another dimension! ",

            "answer_text": "No idea! I mean, I haven't died yet and even after I do I doubt I'll be able to come back and tell you. I suspect if I did, you'd not be so amenable cuz I'd be a ghost. If you ask me what I think happens, then I suspect after we die we simply go back to existing as energy instead of matter. Yes, maybe in a different dimension. I don't believe in the afterlife and heaven and hell. I believe everything is a part of the great cosmic energy. And I believe we are simply a part of this great cycle. Everything exists as energy and we are simply manifestations of that energy in this dimension. The concept of dimension applies here because I think human beings cannot perceive all dimensions that exist. Our vision is limited by our mortal coil. We see only what we are able to within the limits of our body. We can't see energy anyway. We see light because it is in the spectrum our eyes can see. We don't see xrays or uv rays because our eyes can't, but our body perceives it and so we suffer the effects of it. One might say, by this logic, that xrays exist in a different dimension, one we cannot see but we do feel. Even time is a dimension, one we cannot perceive visually, but we perceive it physically. This way there may be many dimensions that we don't perceive physically or visually but we may perceive mentally. Some we may not be able to perceive at all. I think once we die, the knowledge and everything we learned in this present life is transmitted as energy (read information) and after death it goes back to the cloud. I don't know if we would exist with our present identities or consciousness but I do believe all the information we acquired in this life becomes a part of the energy/info cloud. ",

I have to say when I was up there I felt tranquility and a tremendous amount of love.in my body I was sick again when I returned back to my body. I was young at that time i always said I was in a another dimension which was darker then this dimension I could clearly see the difference between the 2 dimensions below my feet And dimension I was in when I died.This was year ago and I only told my wife what had happen to me .one day she read in the paper where people have died and flotted above there bodys.

Your spirit will go to Heaven if you are kind heart person,did good to everyone ,didn\u2019t harm anyone, not being selfish, loving etc. Once your all good did debt will be paid to you your soul will again comes back to materialistic world have a new life In another case your soul will go to Hell if you are a bad guy. Who life has been spent on fullfilling the demands that your senses urges to you. Being cruel, proudy,criminal, rapist etc. Your soul will comes back to the materialist world after you will receive and paid your sentence. Or else your soul will go for Eternal bliss if you are able to gain complete command on your senses and their subjects, complete your duty without worrying or willing about the outcomes, And realising God is one and everything I got as a outcome of my duty, need devote to almigty God .And by being stable mind person in all situation. Considering everyone as equal. So therefore as per above only your soul will move to other dimenson. ",

Think of the energy in a pan of boiling water. If you destroy the pan, the energy (heat, etc.) in the water dissipates and flow around, like it is supposed to do in the absence of a vessel (your body and cells). It is what happens with lizards, trees and wombats. As to the non-energy part of your body, your cells, minerals, and all matter there, this matter is left to recombine with other things in the world because there is no energy to hold it together. As to some evidence pointing to this, think of how the world was before your atoms came together as a living thing and started to function. I mean the wold before you existed. Your atoms and energy were already around, and after you -and I - dissipate, it will be the same thing as before we existed, our \u201cconstituent parts\u201d (matter and energy) will still be around this world for grabs :) ",

You may as well ask if the candle flame goes somewhere when extinguished. If there were another reality- we could not infer so, or anything about it from all this. Science would have found a way by now. Instead, everything we have found confirms material reality is nothing other than material. There are complexities to it we have found, but no ghost in the machine that suggests anything spiritual. There is no seeming magic that defies the way reality normally operates. Your Kuerig isn\u2019t going to make coffee without water in it. What in this reality would even suggest there is another waiting beyond death? ",

If science says that ENERGY can\u2019t be created or can\u2019t be destroyed, only changes the form, then THE ENERGY that gives life may be transformed or transferred to another \u201cOBJECT\u201d. This object should exist in another dimension. This energy particle or soul is may be made of unknown dimension.SO, we can say that after we die ,we go to another dimension. Please give opinion, so I can clear my view if I got wrong here. ",

These personal experiences are hard to verify because they are\u2026well personal. You cannot just enter someone\u2019s NDE or put it in a test tube to verify it as real or not. We really don\u2019t know for sure and people that say they know as a fact are full of themselves because they can\u2019t know unless they die themselves but my theory points to either another dimension, waking up and realizing it was all a dream or a reincarnation/reset making for a clean slate.

So a mundane answer lies in the cultural beliefs you have scientifically speaking it is not more than a running system coming to a permanent halt. We tend to attach emotions with death hence so many assumptions and beliefs otherwise a dead person remains in the same 3 dimensional world we live. Just the form/state changes. ",
