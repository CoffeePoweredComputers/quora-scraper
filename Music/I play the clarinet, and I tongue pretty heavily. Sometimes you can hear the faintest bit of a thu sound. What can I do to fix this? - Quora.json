            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s a common problem. If you want somewhere to start with, you can start practicing tonguing without the clarinet in your mouth. Try to make your tongue light as it touches the reed. If you can still hear the \u201cthu\u201d sound even after practicing that, the best advice I\u2019ve got is this: The tip of the tongue to the tip of the reed. As I learned it, only one taste bud should touch the reed. This may sound a little weird, but take your fingernail, hold it vertically, and scratch the middle part of your tongue, so that the sensation on that taste bud can help you to know what part of the tongue to put on the reed. Also, another reason might be that your tongue is low inside your mouth, so try keeping your tongue up, and again, touching only the tip of your reed. I hope that this can help you! ",

Tonge gently, but quickly. my teacher, from the TSO, said I tongue like a snake. My staccato is nearly awesome. hope this helps\u2026. ",
