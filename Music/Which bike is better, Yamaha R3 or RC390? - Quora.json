            "answer_text": "I own an R3 and i am a tourer and I have rode rc390 several times so hope I am qualified to answer this Firstly even though both bikes fall under same segment both are entirely different and unique in their own way. So let's start with rc Rc is a pure track tool which is OK for city rides as long as the commute is under 80 to 100km. It comes equipped with abs USD forks mezeller tyres ride by wire throttle Slipper clutch aggressive riding position and other features that makes it a perfect track monster and all this package comes at a very aggressive pricing of just 2.7 lakh. The track is its home. Being a single and carrying the best in class power to weight ration its the fastest to 0\u2013100 mark in its segment\u2026. Its a compact bike with good futuristic styling. But definitely its not an everyday bike that we can live with\u2026 it heats up fast in city traffics , aggressive seating posture gives back ache, and also that engine which loves to rev hard will give a head ache at low revs as we have to change gears frequently. 15mnts of city traffic and ur legs are toast. Also the maintainance is not as cheap as we think. The top speed is limited electronically to 178(AFAIK). The 10l fuel tank makes long runs difficult as u have to stop for fuel\u2026 Its not at all a touring bike. Daily commutes are OK and occasional weekend rides and track rides is for what its made for\u2026 Now about R3\u2026. Its an allrounder I will say\u2026 Though it doesn't comes with abs quick shifter USD forks and all(all these except abs is useful only on track) its the best allrounder bike u can buy in 300cc segment. As Yamaha says its a superbike that you can live with everyday. Its inline twin motor is the sweetest and the exhaust note is way way better than rc. Daily commutes , touring and high speed runs r a bliss on r3 as it won't stress out at 150+ speeds like rc and that too with no vibrations. With the sophisticated styling its definitely a head turner. The not so aggressive riding position 14l fuel tank with highway mileage around 30(that's what I get) and softer suspension makes it a perfect tourer. I have done 300+ km without break on it. For daily commutes r3 serves very well without any overheating. Though its around 10kg heavier than rc its manoeuvrable on bumper to number traffic( thanks to lower seat height). For the tracks its not that good\u2026 you will need to change the tyres suspension and clip on s to make it a better track tool\u2026 The top speed is actually 188( company claims) but I managed to touch 190. Its the best handler like rc with slightly slower to 0\u2013100. With my 1 year exp with the bike I found it the best allrounder and worth the price. Experience that sweet high revving engine once and the premium u pay is justified\u2026. Of course there are some cones too like the main life saver is missing The ABS. IT comes with mrf as stock which is good only for touring and takes away confidence at corners and hard braking. The rear brake is not as good as that of rc but the front brake of both gives same response. Running cost is slightly higher very slightly higher than rc.softer suspension make it a difficult track bike. Though the top speed is high initial pick up is less than rc. Conclusion:- if u r a track junkie and wanna feel that adrenalin rush go for rc as its the best package. If u r a relaxed rider who have daily city rides and touring go for r3 and u won't regret the decision. Note:- r3 with better tyres and suspension will kick rc ass on track.(proven by racr) ",

            "answer_text": "Better..?? Lets talk about the bikes in terms of performance and refinement. If we talk numbers and performance its KTM RC 390, a perfect track tool. She has got a punchy powerful motor pumping out 43.50 PS @ 9000 rpm which is best in it\u2019s class, crunching out fastest 0\u2013100 kmph number . She is loaded with Metzeler tyres, WP upside-down separate function forks, ride by wire technology, ABS, lap timer, slipper clutch to attack corners etc. what else you can ask for?? A perfect proposition for value to money. As being a track machine, the rider comfort isn\u2019t great which is expected other than the that the motor is bit buzzy. If you are thinking to take this bike for daily commuting within city or long hauls, you might feel uncomfortable. The ride quality is on the stiffer side, motor tends to heat up quickly and soon you will having back and shoulder aches in stop go traffic.  If we talk refinement then its R3 outperforms the RC 390. Yes the motor is less punchy, it has telescopic forks (RC has upside down forks), she has got normal road going tyres, no ABS and not so good in corners. Still she out performs the RC in terms of ride quality and refinement. She has got 321 cc in-line 2-Cylinder pumping out 42 PS @ 10750 rpm which is almost buzz free. The motor is reliable, ride quality is on softer side and keeps the ride in comfortable zone. Other than being a sports bike she has got some touring capabilities which make her a sports tourer. You can take her to long hauls too with its 14 L fuel tank capacity. Only down side is that the ABS is missing.  If you are looking for a track tool than RC make more sense where as R3 could be used for both long hauls and day to day city riding .i.e RC is better for tacks and sporty riding where as R3 is better for daily commuting and touring.
