            "answer_text": "I would strongly recommend the book by Robin Waterfield called \u201cWhy Socrates Died\u201d. I believe that it directly answers your question. At the risk of a faulty memory, I will attempt to summarize. Socrates was sentenced to death or excommunication by a court for the essential crime of sedition. Back then execution was accomplished by suicide by drinking hemlock. Socrates had the choice of his punishment. His trial, like all trials of the time, lasted one day, and had over 500 jurists (always an odd number of citizens of Athens). The real question was to define the sedition. At the time there was a growing movement by a group called the Sophists. For money the Sophists would sell their ability to convince a jury of one side of a case. Consider them the early lawyers, spin doctors and ad agencies of the time. Socrates taught his disciples that the truth was not subjective and should not be corrupted by money. As in our times, the users of sophistry are those that can pay the most for it. Think of the terms \u201cfake news\u201d and the misleading stories the swamp the Internet. Therefore, the powerful and wealthy of Athens society liked what the Sophists offered them and needed to remove the distraction of Socrates. The lessons of 2,500 years ago are even more relevant today. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s define first \u201csuicide\u201d and determine if Socrates, indeed, had committed suicide. That is the better question to this issue - rather than why. The why is that Socrates has been convicted of \u201ccorrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods\u201d (Wikipedia). Suicide is the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally. - Merriam-Webster DictionarySuicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. - WikipediaSuicide is the act of killing yourself intentionally. -Cambridge DictionaryIn all three of these, there is the element of intention to take one\u2019s life. If there is no intention, it is not suicide. Now, your question is, Why did Socrates commit suicide? There is already an assumption/presumption (in this question) that Socrates committed suicide - that he took his own life intentionally.Let\u2019s look at references. The question we will deal with is this: Did Socrates commit suicide? To make it plain the question will be: Did Socrates kill himself intentionally?From history, Socrates died by drinking the hemlock at the order of the Athenian court. His hand took the cup and drank the hemlock, and died, from his own hands. In antiquity, this is suicide. But recent arguments come up with a fresh look at Socrates\u2019 death, in particular, the one by R. G. Frey (Reference 3), that is elucidated by Reference 4. SUMMARY: Socrates did not agree with suicide (Reference 1). Athenian law prescribed death by drinking a cup of poison hemlock. Socrates drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial and executed his death-sentence. (Reference 2). The concept of suicide in antiquity defers from today (Reference 1 and Reference 4). Socrates, by Athenian Law was prescribed death by drinking a cup of poison hemlock. His hand may have taken the cup, his mouth may have drank the hemlock, but he did not chose when to die. Therefore, to say that Socrates committed suicide is debatable. Socrates\u2019 death is something not easily dismissed. Suicide is death of the person by his own choice. Socrates may not have been afraid to die but he did NOT choose when to die. No, it was not a suicide.  Reference 1. \u201cSuicide in antiquity.\u201d WikipediaOne of the many philosophers who developed an opinion on suicide was Socrates. He eventually says of suicide, \u201ca man, who is one of the god\u2019s possessions, should not kill himself \u2018until the god sends some compulsion upon him, as he sends compulsion on us at present\u2019\u201d. Socrates did not agree with suicide, unless as he says, god tells him or her to do it. Reference 2: \u201cWhy Did Socrates Drink Poison An\u2026\u201d AncientPages.comSocrates was accused of \"refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state\" and of \"corrupting the youth.\" In his book, Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths, author Robin Waterfield offers a comprehensive study of what led to Socrates\u2019 trial, death sentence and interesting account of Athenian history. At the time of the trial, Socrates was 70-year-old. The trial took place in the heart of the city. A crowd of spectators watched how three Athenian citizens, who were Socrates' accusers spent three hours presenting their arguments against the great philosopher. Socrates was then allowed to defend himself for three hours. At the end of the trial, the jury convicted him by a narrow majority and given a death penalty\u2026. Athenian law prescribed death by drinking a cup of poison hemlock. Socrates drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial and executed his death-sentence. Reference 3: Did Socrates Commit Suicide? By R. G. Frey. Article\u2002in\u2002Philosophy 53(203):106 - 108 \u00b7 January 1978. DOI: 10.1017/S0031819100016375It is rarely, if at all, thought that Socrates committed suicide; but such was the case, or so I want to suggest. My suggestion turns not upon any new interpretation of ancient sources but rather upon seeking a determination of the concept of suicide itself. Reference 4: Four famous suicides in history and lessons learned: A narrative review by Andrew J. Hamilton.. Also, he did not protest when the cup was handed to him, and did not have to be \" force-fed \" . Frey (1978) also shoots down the argument that Socrates was under duress, pointing out that even if this were true it is irrelevant because the state had decided he had to die: \" \u2026 what duress Socrates is under pertains to his having to die, not to his having to die by his own hand. \" The final argument he tackles is that Socrates could not have committed suicide because he did not choose when to die. ...
