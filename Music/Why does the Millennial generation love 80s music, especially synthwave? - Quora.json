            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all about the catchy melodies, feel-good nature of the music, and the fact that people born after the 80\u2019s never got to experience the era. I was born in \u201977 . so I got to hear the music on MTV and the radio, but was never old enough to go to concerts, clubs, etc. But in the 90\u2019s as a teenager I was ALL ABOUT 80\u2019s music. The production is another huge part of it. 80\u2019s music was produced at the peak of analog mixing. It has a warmth, a punch, a crispness to it that fell out of fashion in the 90\u2019s and beyond (when everyone went digital crazy). You can hear this most around 1986 - \u201887. Every song in those years seems like it was produced in the same studio with the same gear. Those huge gated snares and toms, compressed kicks, and sweet synths are pretty hard to dislike. And Synthwave is literally produced in much the same fashion. Though with a heavy element of 2000\u2019s Electro-House as a blueprint. ",

            "answer_text": "My dad is only ~20 years older than me, which means his musical taste sits firmly in the 80\u2019s. Growing up, all the cassettes/CDs in my house were 80\u2019s. Squeeze, Erasure, New Order, Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears would play pretty much non-stop. I used to hate it as a kid. However, when I was around 10, I decided I wanted to listen to punk. Because that\u2019s what the cool kids at school were listening to. So guess what my conniving father did? He started handing me CDs and telling me they were punk. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t know any better. I had no idea what punk was. \u201cPunk, huh? You ever heard of Duran Duran? Here, listen to this.\u201d \u201cOh man, if you liked that, you\u2019ll love The Police.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s a good one for you. Ever heard of Blondie? They\u2019re so punk.\u201d To be fair, Blondie probably came the closest to being punk-inspired out of all the 80\u2019s music he deceitfully handed over to me, even if they\u2019re not squarely in the 80\u2019s. So, I started listening to 80\u2019s music. Everything he gave me. Pretty soon, it had its kitschy, synth-driven claws sunk deep into my soul, and there was no turning back. It\u2019s so bad that I catch myself singing these crappy songs to my 4-month-old son. Red red wine makes a great lullaby. Thanks, pops. You right old bastard. ",
