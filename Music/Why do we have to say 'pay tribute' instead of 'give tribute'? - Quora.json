            "answer_text": "Why do we have to say \"pay tribute\" instead of \"give tribute\"? Tribute (Latin tributum) was paid in ancient Rome, in goods or money, to dignitaries in return for services, or exchanged as a form of goodwill between cities. Thence, we pay tribute. That\u2019s not the full story though, because we also pay attention, pay a visit and pay our regards, and I\u2019m not sure that we can blame the Romans for all those usages. As with so many English expressions, the reasons may be lost in history and they may not always seem logical, but they have stuck. ",
