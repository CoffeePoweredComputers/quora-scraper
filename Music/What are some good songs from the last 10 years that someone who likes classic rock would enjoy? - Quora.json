            "answer_text": "There are three albums by the UK band, Porcupine Tree that are a little bit older than ten years but they should be in any serious rock fan\u2019s collection: \u201cIn Absentia\u201d (2002), \u201cDeadwing\u201d (2005) and \u201cFear of a Blank Planet\u201d (2007.) Their music draws upon many diverse influences such as Pink Floyd, Rush, King Crimson, Nine Inch Nails, The Police, Filter, The Beach Boys, CSNY, Thomas Dolby, Donna Summer, ABBA, The Beatles, and many others. They\u2019ve been labeled progressive rock, alternative rock, hard rock, ambient, psychedelic\u2026 You can\u2019t pin a label on this band. There are ten studio albums plus numerous compilation albums, rare tracks, and live albums. Starting with the above three will give you a solid listen into some incredible, original compositions that remind you of classic rock tracks you\u2019ve always loved. The musicianship and the production is first-rate. Once hooked and a bona fide PT fan, you\u2019ll be confused as to why they\u2019ve never dominated FM radio and sold out arenas in America. After these three albums, I would suggest \u201cLightbulb Sun,\u201d \u201cSignify,\u201d \u201cRecordings\u201d and \u201cStupid Dream.\u201d All of the band members have been involved with other projects and Steven Wilson, in particular, has released five solo albums plus a collection of cover songs. Wilson has also been hired to remix (in stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound) some very notable recordings from artists such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Yes, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, XTC, Chicago and Simple Minds, among others. Porcupine Tree should have been huge superstars but the American music industry is messed up (with radio a disaster in particular.) Even so, PT (and Wilson solo) packs theaters all over the world. Many in attendance are musicians.        ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your basic tastes in classic rock If you like progressive rock ( Yes,King Crimson, Genesis etc) try Big Big Train ,Steve Wilson /Porcupine Tree. But this genre is phasing outIf you like psychedelic rock ( Doors ,13th floor elevators) try the Black Angles , Oh sees , Black Mountain, white denim or Brian Jonestown Massacre - if your taste goes for bands like Beatles, Stones , Byrds and VU . I think Psych rock is more popular than before going by the number of new bands and albums being releasedIf you like blues rock or hard rock ( Cream, Allman Bros,The Who ) try the Black Keys, The White Stripes , Royal BloodFor Hard Rock/Metal band fans , Greta Van Fleet is a very young band and it sounds eerily similar to Led Zeppelin in their heydayIf you like pop-rock ( Big Star,Beatles, XTC, ) try indie bands like Arcade Fire, Wilco , Death Cab for cutieFor Pink Floyd Fans will find Radio Head and The Flaming Lips suitableFor metal fans, Disturbed ,Opeth, and Mastodon will be suitableFolk/Folk Rock fans ( CSN. Neil Young,America etc) can try The Lumineers , Mumford and Sons willFor Album Oriented Rock fans( Bruce Springsteen ,Tom Petty, John Cougar Mellencamp etc) , The War on Drugs,The Shins may sound good and some of the 90s bands particularly Foo Fighters, Green Day (pop punk),Pearl Jam may be suitableCountry Rock fans( Poco, Eagles,Flying Burrito Brothers, Pure Prairie League etc) will find Ryan Adams,The Jayhawks,Lucero, Old 97 and Son Volt suitable to their tasteAs regards good songs from the new bands, it is better first to explore the bands in I tunes Browse ,Amazon Prime or You tube and select your own playlist ",
