He had that extra special something. The secret sauce.

There were two other drummer-led bands around the same era: The Police  and Genesis  Make no mistake, Stewart Copeland was the leader of The Police for a loooong time. Now, he\u2019s a Wikipedia page, and Sting has been an international superstar for 40 years. Phil Collins was the only drummer I know who truly dominated his band. Because he sang. Ballads. ",
