            "answer_text": "Well, most reputable instructors need to eat and will charge you money for lessons. However, there are many good lessons and tips on YouTube or other internet sites that you can benefit from. In addition, I have gotten free advice on my singing from singing in a choir. The director is usually good enough to hear your individual voice through the choir and can tell you some beneficial things. You will improve just from singing more often, even without any advice. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "YouTube! You can learn pretty much anything on there. I bought my 12 yr old neice a ukulele and she had learned to play an entire Shawn Mendes song in 3 days on YouTube. Since then (it\u2019s been about 2 years now) she has learned to play guitar and keyboards and improved her singing voice. Her little brother has also learned to play the drums on YouTube which kinda hurts his dad\u2019s feelings because he\u2019s quite the drummer himself having played in a band with him myself for over 10 years.
