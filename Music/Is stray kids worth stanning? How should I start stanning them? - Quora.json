            "answer_text": "Yes they are definitely worth stanning! (Stanning autocorrected to stabbing lol) You should watch some introduction videos first to see who the members are and such. Then start moving on to the songs, they have so many amazing songs that it is super hard but I recommend starting from the beginning and making your way to the top. For me I was first introduced to them by watching a video called the Aussie line of stray kids where it introduced Felix (my bias \u263a\ufe0f) and Bang Chan (the leader of the group). In the video it showed Felix doing his rap of third eye and so I listened to the song itself and that was the first song I listened to by them. After you have introduced yourselves to them you should start watching funny and iconic videos you will not regret it! They are so hilarious they are such a funny group that I thought my friend group was weird but they are even more weird so it made it nice that they are a group that I can relate to. For Bang Chan if you are ever feeling lonely or sad he has your back you can go on YouTube and search Chan\u2019s room episodes talking about mental health and such complications to show you all of the episodes where he talks about mental issues like depression, sadness, loneliness, anxiety, etc. Hope this helped in some way remember to love all of the members and don\u2019t hate anyone because they are all so amazing! ~Atiana ",

            "answer_text": "Yes absolutely they\u2019re like therapy in their songs. Listen to the older ones, but the ot8 versions, and probably don\u2019t get involved in the woojin business because it\u2019s a lot to take in. I\u2019ve been with them for a while but it\u2019s still hard to think about. but- learn the members and their voices first. Learn their faces. Watch hyunjin, felix, lee know\u2019s dancing, felix\u2019s deep voice, 3racha\u2019s producing skills and older songs, changbin\u2019s rap, seungmin, i.n, and han\u2019s incredible vocals, chan\u2019s leadership, and their duality. once you learn about the members, watch their music videos because they\u2019re beautiful. I recommend levanter, back door, and get cool to show the discography. absolutely would recommend stray kids, they\u2019re so supportive and welcoming. edit; i think you should also check out chris\u2019s scandals and develope an opinion on them. Personally, i think it\u2019s the past and he\u2019s an incredible, smart, caring man who didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter, but make your own opinions. have fun. ",
