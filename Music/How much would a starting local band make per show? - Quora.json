            "answer_text": "I have played in local rock, oldies and country cover bands for more than 50 years, primarily in the NY, CT and NJ area. Throughout the entire time, we almost always got and still get $100 per person, per night. (so much for inflation)! You provide your own PA and lights, run your own sound, and load in and out yourself. You also need to be entertaining, and realize it\u2019s not about you and your music. Your job is to attract and keep a crowd, and sell booze and food. Back in the day, a bar/club would book the band for 3 or 4 nights in a week, so you could actually make a minimum wage kind of living at it. These days, clubs usually book a band for one night. We have a circuit of clubs that works out to about once a month for each. It\u2019s unusual to have two or more gigs in a week. This means that you might make $5000 a year. So look at it as a fun hobby that kinda pays for itself. To make better money, you need to do events, major venues, cruise ships, concerts, and yes, weddings. You need to be really tight, have a great show, look great, preferably with at least one hot chick singer, horns, etc. and sound exactly like the current hits you\u2019re playing. It\u2019s a lot of work, but these gigs can pay thousands. Another thing I do is have a duo on the side (using backing tracks, and featuring a female vocalist) which is suitable for smaller venues, week nights, etc. Since there are only two people, you can undersell bands, and fill in gaps in your band schedule. I\u2019ve never been in an original band. There is pretty much no way make any money locally, in most places. You have to tour, and even then, you\u2019ll be lucky to break even. You also should be based in LA, NYC or Nashville, depending on your genre, and be networking, etc. I sell my original music on iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, etc. It\u2019s fun to have your stuff \u201cout there\u201d, but you make very little on it. I almost never play anything for free. An occasional charity, maybe, in a large venue, for \u201cexposure\u201d. We don\u2019t do showcases, open mics, battle of the bands, or any \u201cpay to play\u201d scheme. We avoid playing for the door. Any half decent bar can pay you something. Maybe you\u2019ll do an intro rate show for less than $100 per person, but make sure the club knows it\u2019s just an intro rate. If you please the crowd, and the bar has a good \u201cring\u201d. they will want you back at your regular rate. Put together a tight band, look and sound professional, and go out and have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer with a figure. The venue would usually decide with a band on whether they would pay a flat fee, a percentage of the door, or the entire door money. An established band would have a fee they are prepared to play for and the venue would have an idea of their following. With a new band it is all guesswork. The venue might decide to take a risk and offer a flat fee. They would then advertise the gig to make sure they didn't lose out. The venue may offer a percentage of the door money so it would be in the band's interest to also advertise the gig to increase their fee. If the band received all the door money the venue may do no advertising at all so it is important to advertise, especially if the band has to pay for the PA. This may be owned by the venue or you may have to hire it independently. At this point you know how many.people you need to get through the door before the gig stops costing and starts paying the band. I vividly remember counting people in venues to see if we would have to pay for the PA or if we were going to actually get paid. The actual amount paid is hard to say. You may play for just beer money or receive \u00a3200. But it's fairly usually as a new band to earn virtually nothing initially. With time it is definitely possible to earn a wage from it but you need to put the time in to create a following so venues know you are a safe bet. When you are starting out as a new musician it\u2019s like being an apprentice. Some people will do the rags to riches meteoric rise but they can fall just as quickly. Do your time, pay your dues and you could have a career that will last for many many years. Remember that the more in the band the smaller your piece of the pie. Merchandise is a great way to bump up what you take on the night. Sell CDs and T-shirts. You can make your own CDs and create covers. Pull in favours from friends who are artistic. It is good for them to be able to add your cd cover to their resume and you can pay them back in free tickets to gigs or a percentage from the sale of your merchandise - but don\u2019t go mad - remember you have to make the recording ( homemade or studio). buy the gear to record with, print the cds ( is this ad hoc at home or do you do a print run of 500 cds). The more CDs you get printed the cheaper they are per item but you have to sell them in order for the extras to make sense but it is cheaper to do a reprint if you sell out as you don\u2019t have to pay for the artwork and production costs again only the actual cd printing. Some friends of mine make really quirky band merchandise and youtube videos - they make flip books and quirky band related art work that would be cool gifts even if you knew nothing about the band so think outside the box. Keep the price down on your CDs. This is an extra item people will buy as part of their night out. It is not the latest album from a big artist. You can\u2019t expect to command the same price. You want people to take a piece of the band home with them at the end of the night\u2026\u2026.And don\u2019t just stand there by the door as the crowd are leaving with a box of CDs looking surely\u2026get out there and sell yourself to the crowd\u2026.be a nice friendly approachable person and do the rounds of the audience. I could easily add between \u00a3100 to \u00a3300 extra sales to a gig by putting on a big grin and going and talking to people. They often want to talk to the band but don\u2019t want to look uncool by hanging around the side of the stage. ",
