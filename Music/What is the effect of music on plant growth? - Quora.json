            "answer_text": "Plants chose not to move around. Though plant life deals with different obstacles and goals than animal life. Just because plants basic concepts are further away from humans animals brought us to the believe they were not conscious. See a tree, living for hundreds of years. How come a tree should spend his life with the sole purpose of becoming lumber? Regarding your question, there is overwhelming evidence plants have senses and equations of feelings. They act and react. Obviously they somehow understand the concept of music, as they significantly do better when presented classical music, while under performing on fast, aggressive music that would distract humans too. The mystery of life is a sealed box still. And there is not that one key to open it. It seems a good choice to believe in things we can not understand nor see. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been many studies conducted over the years to show the effect of music on plant growth. Plants tend to prefer classical music (because they thrive when exposed to it), and tend to do poorly when exposed to heavy metal music. They\u2019ve done the same test with water. There have also been tests to show how plants react to different thoughts and emotions, and how far away the person had to be from the plant/water for it to react. There are a lot of eye-opening videos about plant consciousness on Youtube if you\u2019re interested. :) ",
