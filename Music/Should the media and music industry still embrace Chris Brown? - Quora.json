            "answer_text": "I think in the case of Chris Brown there will never be a total forgiveness of his actions and his success will always be incredibly watched and scrutinised for the rest of his career. As we all take an incredibly dim view of domestic violence and I believe I am not alone that he is an artist that even I would struggle to morally represent, let alone ethically do so. So he may be on Dancing with the Stars but those tv programs are designed to be airtime fodder and to try and revive flagging careers. So I would not call it a continued success but a bit of a downward spiral especially career wise. I compare Chris Brown to Ike Turner whose brutal abuse of Tina Turner went on for years and he never really recovered from it and like Tina Turner Rhianna has gone on to become an amazing superstar. And that is the greatest punishment he will always have by the industry. No music exec would ever want to promote him above Rhianna and therefore his career will always remain very under the real radar from now on in. ",
