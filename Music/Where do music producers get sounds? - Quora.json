            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re REALLY getting at but I\u2019m going to tell you a little naughty truth. A lot of producers Pirate their sounds, whether it\u2019s VSTs, Sample Packs, getting it from friends or from Torrent tracker websites that specialise in pirating VSTS and sounds. I\u2019m not going to sugar coat it but I\u2019d say 60% of people either do that or they never get the sounds that they are really looking for. Home :: Audionews.org is one of these sites and you need someone to invite you Piratebay was massive and the whole myriad of other torrent sites should have some good stuff. I know I\u2019m going to get some hate for this but fuck it. The truth is the truth. Just for a little idea on Pirating vs Legit. Nexus 2 costs like $3000 to buy the VST and some packs. So I guess thats why people do it. So they can sound like Calvin harris without the price tag. NOTE: If you can afford to buy everything legit, I would say do it. It helps the creators of the tools. For those who cannot afford it, I\u2019m going to say this is how OTHER producers get their sounds. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say based on your question, you\u2019re confusing beat-making with music production. What does a music producer do? Difference to beat-makers & engineers. A person can just direct a band and they\u2019re a music producer. In that case, their sounds are coming from the band. If they\u2019re a music producer and beat-maker, if they have skills like Timberland, they can play everything themselves and the sounds come from their keyboards, drum machines, synths and virtual synths and drum machines. Sometimes they might rip a sound out of a song whether vinyl or digital, make it themselves, program a synth from scratch to create a unique one of a kind sound or tweak a synth patch to create a unique sound. You can also buy one shot drum loops and hits as well as synth presets. Kiddies like to buy whole songs and loops of instruments made by people with more skills than them like Apple Loops in Garageband and pretend they made it. I would argue that\u2019s not music production. That\u2019s closer to DJing, playing a bunch of stuff you didn\u2019t make on top of each other. If you really want to know you can look behind the scenes at the music producers and beat-makers on Quora here: Beat-makers & Producers ",
