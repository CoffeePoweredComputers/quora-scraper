            "answer_text": "A Gibson would be well suited for David\u2019s lead style, except that he likes to use the whammy bar a lot and a bigsby on a Gibson wouldn't sound quite the same. Also, besideS his lead playing he\u2019s an amazing texturalist, and Gibsons always retain a certain, bulk to their sound that makes them less suited for minimalistic textural guitar playing than a Stratocaster, which can sound fluid and soaring for leads with the right effects. Also the \u2018feel\u2019 of each is significantly different so he most likely finds the Stratocaster more comfortable to play. By the way, the \u2018Another Brick In the wall pt 2\u2019 solo was done with a Les Paul with P90s. ",
