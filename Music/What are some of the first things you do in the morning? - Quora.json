            "answer_text": "\u201cIf it\u2019s your job to eat a frog, it\u2019s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it\u2019s your job to eat two frogs, it\u2019s best to eat the biggest one first.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain Morning Ritual Unless traveling, I follow my morning ritual religiously to make better decisions throughout my day. Without the help of an alarm clock, I wake up anytime between 6 to 7 AM. After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I take a cold shower before walking to the community pool for a ten to fifteen-minute swimming session. The cold shower is my way of moving from the unconscious to conscious.  Even though I\u2019ve been taking cold showers for a long time, my body still doesn\u2019t like it, especially in the morning. Attempting to fight the cold, my hands naturally want to turn the shower handle to increase the water temperature. But I consciously decide not to do it by choosing discomfort. After about five to ten seconds, my body acclimates to the temperature and starts the release of ecstatic and joyful feelings. Starting my day with overcoming discomfort such as taking a cold shower, I view any challenges later in the day as relatively easy. A cold shower is a form of eustress (positive stress) that\u2019s healthy for the body and the mind to improve my immunity to distress (negative stress). Afterward, I walk around the neighborhood and enjoy its beautiful scenery before walking back home. Because exercising in the morning is scientifically proven to provide higher quality sleep, I choose to exercise in the morning. In addition, sunlight exposure in the morning resets the circadian rhythm that fully wakes me up. Feeling physically energized, I sit down for a one-hour vipassana meditation practice to train my mind to be calm and equanimous despite feeling both pleasant and unpleasant sensations in the body. Just like every muscle in the body, my mind requires frequent training to grow and stay strong. After completing my morning ritual, I'm in a highly positive mental and physical state ready to take on the day. Conserving Your Decision-Making Power Having a powerful morning ritual can the difference between a productive and a sterile day. By having a morning ritual, it saves your decision-making abilities for more important decisions in the later part of your day. Similar to willpower, your decision-making skills diminishes the more decisions you make. Hence, if you can automate the activities which you do in the morning to empower you, then you can save your decision-making skills for later when you need it the most - such as choosing \u201cno\u201d to eat that sugary dessert because it hinders your health progress. 35,000 is your average number of conscious decisions that you make per day according to Roberts Wesleyan College.[1] About 200 is made just for food according to research from Cornell University.[2] Given the amount of limitless of options, you\u2019re constantly forced to decide. It could be as simple as deciding what to wear in the morning.  Why do you think Mark Zuckerberg wears the same type of gray t-shirt every day? It\u2019s because he wants to save his decision-making power for big decisions that can better help serve the Facebook community. All these small decisions that you make throughout the day add up. The fewer decisions you\u2019ll have to make, the more decision-making power you\u2019ll have which results in making better decisions that can improve your life. By knowing exactly what your morning activities will be, you can conserve your superpower for the more important decisions in your day. That\u2019s not to say you have to follow the same routine every morning because you always have the choice and flexibility to change it up. They're activities that will empower you to be more productive, joyful, and free. Put them on Your Calendar Before the end of each day, I write down tasks on my calendar that I want to get done the next day.  By putting them on the calendar, I know exactly what I must do for tomorrow. To get the most from my day, I aim to tackle the most difficult and important task first after my morning routine. The term \u201ceating the frog\u201d means to do the hardest task first thing in the morning. By completing the most difficult task first, you\u2019re setting up your day for great success because you've already conquered your toughest battle. You also build momentum for yourself to take on more tasks that are on your calendar. Despite not completing other tasks, you\u2019ll feel great about your day and yourself. To accommodate some flexibility in my schedule, I block out a few hours of \u201cfree time\u201d to do whatever I want. It may include the following: YogaRunningCyclingReading a bookListening to a podcastWatching an educational videoOn days if I\u2019m in an intense \u201cflow state,\u201d then I continue to plow through my current task regardless of what my schedule says. The flow state is the \u201cfeeling of exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished and becomes the landmark in memory for what life should be like\u201d according to the book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a positive psychologist.  This is when you feel time goes by effortlessly because you\u2019re having fun focused on your current task. You\u2019re truly present to the current moment and aren\u2019t distracted by anything else. To experience flow state, you must be engaged in a task that\u2019s slightly challenging.  However, the task can\u2019t be too difficult because you can have anxiety. It also can't be too easy because you\u2019ll feel bored. Create an Empowering Morning Ritual To create an empowering morning routine, start off with extremely effortless activities that will put you in a positive mood. It could be listening to your favorite song -this can be the song for your alarm clock.  Other options might be listening to your favorite podcast or motivational speech. Or you can sit down and have some alone time for you to visualize how you want your day to unfold. Reading your favorite book, eating your favorite breakfast, or having your favorite beverage can be the beginning of a productive and enjoyable day. Starting with small steps, you can slowly build up to bigger tasks such as exercise for your body and mind. You\u2019ll eventually get to a point where it will feel \u201cweird\u201d when you don\u2019t do these activities in the morning. Your current morning ritual was also built over time and it will require a conscious effort to make new changes. But just like anything, the more you practice, the better you\u2019ll become. Closing Thoughts Your morning routine can work for you or against you. Everything you do is either making your life better or worse. All habits were built over a long period of time. Some are easier to break than others, but you have complete control over them. It starts with your \u201cwhy\u201d you want to make the change. Why do you want to make a change?What\u2019s your goal?What benefits will you receive from making the change?If it\u2019s important to you, you will make the time for it. Reward yourself with small wins to encourage yourself to keep going. It takes time to form new and healthy habits but the benefits are definitely worth it. The most important factor to new habit forming is patience. But what will make the new habits easier to adapt is their enjoyability.  That\u2019s because if you enjoy doing them, you\u2019ll be more likely to stick with the new activities. Your morning ritual can be the catalyst you need to have an amazing day. Let it empower you.

            "answer_text": "The lives of most of the answerers seem, to me, hilariously uncluttered. So, I\u2019m going to share mine. Below is my typical weekday morning: 1)6:30ish - wake to some combination of alarm clock and/or puppy whining from his crate. *Drag my sad night-person ass out of bed. *Let the puppy out of his crate, the other dog out of my older son\u2019s bedroom, the other-other dog out of her crate, and then all three of them outside. *Feed the cat. *Stumble into the bathroom. Pee and brush my teeth. *I now initiate the often long and arduous process of waking up my teenager, the aforementioned older son. *Find some kind of shoes \u2014 any will do; kid\u2019s flip-flops? husband\u2019s size 13 work boots? Whatever, don\u2019t care \u2014 and if it\u2019s cold, a coat or something. Go outside to open pop door of chicken coop (that\u2019s the little door the chickens use.) Check if chickens and dogs have drinkable water and refill if needed. *Shuffle back inside with dogs. By now, my eyes are usually open enough for me to notice I can\u2019t see. Find my glasses (think Velma from Scooby Doo.) *Go poke inert teenager again. Let dogs jump on his bed and lick him. *Find the kids\u2019 lunchboxes. Remove whatever lunch remnants they forgot to unpack - again - and set them aside with any other scraps I saved for the chickens. *Round 3 of trying to get older son vertical. *On the days my husband has to get up and leave, I usually run into him in the hall around this time. We grunt noncommitally at each other in passing. He is not great at mornings either. *Pack lunches. My kids are really too old, and ought to be doing this themselves, but the process of them doing it is about three times harder on me than doing it myself. I just make the damn sandwiches. Don\u2019t judge. *If teenager is still in bed, threats and underhanded tactics usually commence around now. *Unload the dishwasher. If there is time, start some laundry. *Wander into my office and turn on my computers, both work and personal. I work from home full time. *See husband and older son out the door. Secretly watch through the window to see if son misses the bus, because he cuts it awfully fine, but somehow he has made it just in time all year. *It\u2019s now 7:10. I\u2019m reading work email and web comics. *About 7:30, bring the puppy into younger son\u2019s room. Hoist him into son\u2019s loft bed because son thinks this is a hilarious way to wake up. Retrieve puppy after a minute and chat a little bit with the only morning person in my family. *If needed, help kid get breakfast and pack up his stuff for school. *Take scraps out to throw to chickens. Dogs go with me. Scold puppy for trying to steal food from chickens. *Check chickens\u2019 feeder and fill if needed. *Put out food for barn cats. *Go inside and poke at work for a few minutes. *Feed dogs at 8:00, then back to work again. *See younger son off to school at 8:20 *Start to dig into work for real. Make any phone calls I need to do. *Grab something for breakfast and take my meds. Usually I eat in front of my work PC. *About 10, I get around to taking a shower and putting on actual clothes. On weekends, I usually just take care of the animals and then go back to bed. ",

            "answer_text": "From a young age I have trained myself to waking up with out an alarm! My day seems to go so much better when I can wake up naturally. Though on important days I may set my watch but often wake up prior to it going off. Upon waking, first and foremost morning sunggie cuddles and kisses with my special doggo! He loves to get massages in the morning. I\u2019m fortunate in that He\u2019s never been a morning boy so I don\u2019t have to wake up before the chickens to let him out. After this the next thing I do during the summer months is check the current temperature. During the night I run a few fans in the windows to draw in the cool fresh air, and like to take the fans down close up the windows before the temperature rises above 60\u00b0F/15\u00b0C. This helps the house to stay quite cool and often times I don\u2019t need to run the AC which helps me save money! I then like to make warm lemon water. In a jar I take 1/3 boiling water then add 2/3 quart jar room temperature quart to make the perfect warm temperature. I then add 1/2 of a lemon freshly squeezed. I do it in this order so that when the lemon is added the temperature isn\u2019t to strong that it kills the heat sensitive enzymes and other natural goodness found in lemons. This helps get the digestive organs working. I am trying to re-cultivate the talent of morning exercise too! :D My dog loves to get out and its good exercise for him too! Though I think he would much rather prefer it later in the morning. I play an html web-based game as well so I like to check in and wake my city up to prepare it for the day. I like to listen to mellow folk music in the morning hours whilst drinking my lemon drink and gaming. Amazon Prime has a great mellow folk playlist wich has some timeless classics from Simon & Garfunkle, Don Mclean, James Taylor, John Denver, Tom Petty, CSNY, CCR, etc., Tracy Chapman, Sara Mclachlan, Ray Lamontague and even some more modern artist with a mellow sound. I have a Boyce Avenue playlist I enjoy real well too. I think most importantly though, the success of the morning starts the night before with any preparations and having an idea of what needs to be done and going to bed at a decent hour. Science has proven that an hour before midnight is as two hours of body healing that takes place. Stop Cancer with Phytotherapy ",

            "answer_text": "Work Morning My alarm clock goes off an hour before I need to leave the house. Now there are two possibilities. Scenario 1. Without fully waking up, I roll over and turn it the f*ck off because once again I mostly likely, accidentally stayed up way too late reading/watching a show. Part of my brain tells me \u201cYou lazy bum: get up.\u201d But the rest of my brain says \u201cMmmmmmm warm boyfriend must haz all the cuddles naow kthnxbai.\u201d Perhaps I'm awake enough that I check my phone notifications and browse around various sites, but most likely I stay 95% asleep. 20 minutes before I need to be driving to work, my eyes fly open as my internal clock finally tells me that I have literally no seconds left to snooze and still be on time. Internally screaming at the unfairness of life, I roll out of bed, put on some clothes (maybe), and hustle to the kitchen. There's probably already a pan with water on the stove, so that gets turned on. While the water heats, I wash my travel mug and stick a few tea bags in it. Water isn't hot yet, so I go yank on my work clothes, still internally screaming and swearing. 5 hours is not enough sleep for me. Water boils, fix my tea, and now the fur babies are probably crying around my ankles, so I feed them. Breakfast occurs to me. I have about 12 minutes before I need to leave. Definitely not enough time to make hashbrowns and eggs. Dammit. I eat a bagel or some cereal with one eye on the clock instead. It's also too late to make lunch. Dammit. A snack bar goes in my backpack, it\u2019s now exactly the time I need to leave, and I haven't finished my bagel/cereal. I go into the bedroom and smooch the sleeping boyfriend. If he wakes up a little I get a sleepy/warm hug. Awake or not, I whisper \u201cI love you.\u201d and slink out of the room. UJuggling my breakfast, mug of tea, backpack, and bad attitude, I cuss my way out the door and rattle down the street, somehow managing to drive a stick shift while eating cereal and holding my mug. Probably puffing on my vape every so often as well. Halfway to work I suddenly come out of my sleepy/angry fugue and instead am sleepy/grumpy in full wakefulness. I puff on my vape and glower. Scenario 2 I wake up a few seconds before my alarm and turn it off. I wiggle my toes, stretch, kiss the boyfriend on the cheek (he doesn't wake up.), and smile at the ceiling. What's not to enjoy about the day? I'm rested, warm, woke up spooning with my most favoritest boyfriend I've ever had, and there's a kitten by my head looking adorable. Well, no time to waste! I hop out of bed, get dressed, feed the kittehs, and start my tea water on the stove. Laptop acquired, set on the table, and an episode of whatever started. I cook myself some breakfast and make a lunch while laughing at the show - my morning show is always comedic. I sit at the table and eat my breakfast and drink my tea while watching my show, and probably browsing websites on my phone as well. Perhaps if I'm feeling creative, I'll forgo the show and write instead. Well, ten minutes till I have to leave, and I'm done with breakfast, my show/writing, and my tea. I pad into the bedroom to smooch the sleeping boyfriend. If he wakes up I get a quick cuddle before running out the door! I leave the house, juggling lunchbox, backpack, and my second cup of tea. It's so gorgeous - this I notice immediately. I drive to work smiling at the scenery. Puff puff on my vape, too. Non-Work Morning Stay in bed forever. ",

            "answer_text": "This morning I woke up and opened the blinds. The sky was gray and fog covered everything. Fall is here. This kind of weather is not typical for Denver in any season, so it caught me a bit by surprise. The apartment was quiet and slightly cold. I had nothing on my schedule, as usual, since I\u2019m currently unemployed.  Here\u2019s how I started my day. The same thing I do every day. Something everyone can and should do to start their day off right. It takes only a few minutes and costs only as much as a piece of paper and a pen. I can sum it up in one word. Gratitude. I\u2019ve been doing this for over a year. I don\u2019t remember where I heard about it first. I listen to several podcasts with hosts who interview high performing people in all areas of life. One piece of advice or routine that is common across a vast majority of them, and many of the hosts who are also quite successful, is some kind of practice or observance of gratitude. The way I do this is to keep a small notebook and a pen in the drawer next to my bed. As soon as I get up, after taking care of the minor things, opening blinds, using the bathroom, taking a sip of water, etc, I get out my notebook and I write down three things that I am grateful for. I try to make these different things each day. Today one of them was for the fog covering the field and surrounding the trees outside my window and the beautiful view.  It is entirely too easy to focus on the negative things in life. We evolved that way. The caveman who noticed the beautiful vistas of the African savannah instead of the lion behind the next bush didn\u2019t live to father the next generation. There are a lot fewer hungry lions these days, but we still tend to focus on the negative things, what\u2019s wrong, what might harm us, how we wish things would be some other way. Intentionally finding things to be grateful for, even on the worst mornings, reinforces the positive things in life. I find that just taking a few minutes every day to do this has greatly improved my mood and attitude. Despite currently being unemployed, I notice and focus on new things that are good in my life every day. This already has and will continue to present me with opportunities that I otherwise would have missed. Even if it didn\u2019t, it helps me to have a better attitude about things that we can\u2019t control in life. Summer is ending, the weather is getting colder. At some point, despite living in Colorado and being warm blooded, I may have to wear long pants or even proper enclosed shoes again. It would be easy to get upset about all the great things about summer that are now over, but I choose to do the opposite. While the trend of pumpkin spice everything is greatly overdone, it is nice to be able to cook with squash, pumpkin, and other fall vegetables again. Pumpkin beers, and my personal favorite, fresh hop beers are filling store shelves. I choose to focus on the good aspects of what is happening and enjoy the present moment. Gratitude has greatly changed my attitude and with it, the course of my life. By introducing this inexpensive, five minute habit to your morning, you can achieve similar results. ",

            "answer_text": "#1: I get up at the same time every day I have my alarm set for the same time every day, even on weekends at 6 am. Getting up at the same time helps my body to build a sleeping schedule and ensures the last sleeping cycle gets completed just before I have to get up. Once the alarm goes off, I\u2019ll get up immediately. No snooze button. #2: I make my bed Making my bed is my first win for the day, and by doing it, I cast a vote for being disciplined and getting things done. I\u2019m not doing anything hotel-like, but just straighten out the blanket and re-arrange the pillows. Also, it\u2019s nice to go to the bedroom at night and to look at a nicely made bed. #3: I weigh myself After a quick toilet visit, I will check my weight. Weighing myself daily is crucial to me as I need to know whether I\u2019m progressing towards my weight goals. I\u2019m using Bluetooth scales that automatically transfer my weight to an app. #4: I drink warm water After 7\u20138hrs of sleep I will need to hydrate my body. Every morning I squeeze some lemon juice and salt into a glass of water and heat it in the microwave. Drinking warm water in the morning not only hydrates you but also activates your bowel and supports a healthy digestive system. #5: I eat a protein-rich breakfast I always look forward to my breakfast as it fuels my body for the day. I have protein and fats and supplement with vegetables which are in line with my weight goals. #6: I have a cold shower I always start with warm water and apply body wash and wash my hair. For the last 30 seconds or so, I turn the warm water off and shower cold. Stepping under the cold shower helps me with willpower, strengthens my immune system and gives me energy for the day. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve spent the past few months interviewing New York Times best-selling authors, entrepreneurs and executives asking them that exact question. Everyone\u2019s routine differs depending on work, location and their family circumstances. That said, here are 5 great responses: 1. Joanna Penn, best-selling author, podcaster and founder of the Creative Penn If I'm in first draft creation mode, then I am generally at a local caf\u00e9 by 7 a.m. And I do kind of 7 till 9:30 and then I go do some exercise. So I mentioned yoga, I go to yoga or I go spinning for example or go for a walk because I find two and a half hours of creation and my brain is dead. And then I'll come back, probably do some admin so I try and do my creation before my emails. 2. John Romero, creator of Doom and Wolfenstein, game developer and entrepreneur First I do mail. I've got to catch up on mail because if there's anything important that I need to answer, I want to do that first thing to just make sure that I'm caught up for whatever came in overnight. Since we're eight hours ahead of the United States, stuff could totally come in while I'm sleeping, so it's important ... Not that I do a lot of business in the US, but it's a good idea to just do email first. Then we do stand up, where we all know what's every team member and what we're working on. Then, I usually do business stuff after that for a while. I try and keep the creative stuff until at least after 4:00 PM. 3. Jeff Hayden, freelance writer and columnist for Inc So literally wake up, brush my teeth, go downstairs, sit down, and I have my protein bar while I start working. And so my time from waking up to working is a couple of minutes, which is perfect for me because right away I've eliminated all that resistance you have to getting started. And I get started and I'm working on something that's important and it's when I'm fresh. And so when I get it done, it feels great because it always feels good to knock off the thing that you really needed to get done. And I've got that cool momentum that comes from having gotten started and having accomplished something, then that makes you feel good and you're like, \"Okay, what's next? And what's next?\" And that carries basically throughout the day. If I get up and ease my way into work, then I don't know, I find it really hard to click over to, \"Okay, let's focus and let's work.\" But if I get started that way, that kind of goes and then I always know what I want to do the next day, the night before and I work on those things. 4. Garrain Jones, author and public speaker For me, it's working on something that you love. It's a project. Here's what I've noticed. Whenever I didn't have anything that I was working on and I wasn't living up to a vision or anything like that, if I would try to do a power hour ... If I would try to wake up early, I would not wake up because I wasn't plugged into anything that was bigger than myself. 5, Ryan Moran, podcaster, entrepreneur, founder of Capitalism.com If I have an uninterrupted 60 minutes at the beginning of my day, it usually starts first thing in the morning. I'm going through my supplement routine. Which, right now, is a multivitamin, fish oil, Metformin ... What else is there? Vitamin D. There's my first thing that I do in the morning. I actually immediately then go into stretching routine. I sit at a computer more than I would like, and I've found ... but I also work out every day, so I have pretty intense stretching routine that I go through in order to break up tension in my hips and my lower back and my hamstrings, which have been built up over sitting at a computer screen for way too many years, way too many hours in way too ",

            "answer_text": "Weekday morning: My eyes usually pop open about 10 minutes before my alarm is set to go off. I hate to have my alarm go off and wake up the \u00fcber-hub. About four days out of five I\u2019m already awake and can turn it off before it sounds. I use those 10 minutes to check my Quora notifications and messages in bed. I don\u2019t try to respond to anything; just see what\u2019s out there. Then I get out of bed and stumble into the bathroom to pee. This is when I put on my Bluetooth headset and start my audio book. I usually have to rewind to find the spot where I fell asleep listening to it the night before. I head down the hall to the bedroom that has been converted to one of my closets and put on my plush leopard-print robe and fuzzy socks. If it\u2019s cold in the house I\u2019ll also pull on some yoga pants or pajama bottoms. Meandering into the kitchen, stopping to pet any whisker-kids that have come out to say good morning, is next. Hopefully there\u2019s tea in the fridge. If so, I\u2019ll put a couple of scoops of sugar in a large, lidded mug and almost fill it with tea. Then I use a fat plastic straw to stir the sugar into the tea until it\u2019s mostly dissolved and add four ice cubes. Yes, exactly four. No more, no less. If there\u2019s no tea, I will settle for a glass of lemonade or some water and glare accusingly at the empty tea pitcher on the counter, knowing I was most likely the one who left it there without making more. Then I take my morning pills; there are five right now. I pop open my work laptop to scan my inbox and get a jump on anything urgent. My Partners spend a lot of time in places where it\u2019s later than it is here, so when it\u2019s 7am here it might be 8am or even the middle of the day for one or more of them, or a flight might have gotten canceled or an early meeting need to be rescheduled. I only address the things that can\u2019t wait for an hour until I\u2019m on the bus. Very quietly slipping back into the master bedroom, I cross back into the bathroom, close the door, and take a shower. This takes all of five minutes - I have very little hair to wash and I don\u2019t understand why showering takes some people (including the \u00fcber-hub!) so long. What is there to do? Shampoo hair, rinse hair, scrub face, rinse face, lather up body, rinse body, done. I\u2019m fortunate to be a nearly-hairless critter who doesn\u2019t have to shave very often. It\u2019s just about the second-biggest blessing in my life. Emerge from shower, towel off, apply deodorant, snuggle back into robe and fuzzy socks, Q-tip ears (I know, I know, but it just feels so good!), restart audio book, finger-comb hair. Apply makeup - this also takes five minutes - and brush teeth. Quietly sneak back into the bedroom and kiss the sleeping \u00fcber-hub on whatever bit of his head is visible. Tell him goodbye while he half-opens his bleary eyes and mumbles something that usually sounds a lot like, \u201cI was killing dinosaurs! And I could fly!\u201d He is a vivid dreamer. Leave the bedroom, closing the door behind me so he\u2019s not mobbed by whisker-kids. Go back into the closet-room and get dressed for the day. Remain in fuzzy socks, carrying shoes out with me. They will be donned exactly two seconds before I step out of my car. Gather my laptop, work folder and notebooks into my bag, refill my tea if there\u2019s any left (adding two more scoops of sugar and four more ice cubes), pet any visible wandering kittycats, and I\u2019m out the door. Weekend morning: Stay in bed. ",

            "answer_text": " I woke up this morning, like I do every morning, at 4am. This is what I look like at 4:00 am. I am clearly not a morning person. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m cold, I\u2019m pissed off and just generally not to be fu#*ed with. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWow, you must have to go to work REALLY early.\u201d Well, you\u2019re wrong. I choose to do this\u2026 Why? Because, despite looking & feeling like a turd that was assaulted with pepper spray, this is when I get the most sh*t done. You see, there is an art to starting yourself up at 4am when you\u2019re not a morning person. It\u2019s a lot like starting up a crappy car in cold weather or starting a fire by rubbing two sticks together. It\u2019s methodical. It\u2019s frustrating. It takes many tries to get it right. It is The Art of the Routine. Here is mine: 4:00 am: Wake up, put on a ridiculous oversized hoodie. 4:00 - 4:05 am: Stumble to the coffee maker, start making coffee (light roast, I hear it has more caffeine). 4:05 - 4:15 am: Stretch, listen to my body make assorted cracking sounds, maybe fart once or twice. 4:15 - 5:00 am: Write. This is where the magic happens. I get more high-quality writing done in this 45-minute window than I would in 3 hours at night. No joke. So, by this point, I\u2019m all wired from the coffee and creative energy. This is what I look like now:  No bueno. Need to chill out. 5:00 to 5:15 am: Meditate. It looks like I\u2019m just twitching on a cushion but trust me, I\u2019m actually in a deep state of tranquility and inner peace. This gets me mentally prepared for my next task\u2026 5:15 to 5:50 am: Answer emails and clear my inbox. FML. 5:50 to 7:00 am: Go to Crossfit, unleash the inner beast (thinking about emails and scheduling for rage-based-motivation). 7:00 to 8:00 am: Cold Shower (best body hack ever), breakfast (usually oatmeal and a protein shake) and head to the office. At this point the 30-minute, steamy, hellish morning commute on public transit doesn\u2019t even faze me. By the time I\u2019m at work, I look happier than a hammer in a nail factory (pretty sure that\u2019s an expression) and I\u2019m ready to crush the day.  ** UPDATE: A lot of people have been asking me what time I go to sleep (understandably so). 9:00 to 9:30 pm works well for me but your mileage will vary. Also, WOW, the response to this is unbelievable, 1.2K upvotes and counting! You guys rock! If I had known this many people would read this answer I might have left out the yoga-fart bit. Oh well. ** ",

            "answer_text": "get up as soon as your alarm rings  The alarm only has to go off once, and you get up!

            "answer_text": "Some mornings everything goes right. You wake up before your alarm goes off. Your morning jog feels like playtime. The coffee tastes better. And there is no traffic on your way into the office. And when you sit down to get to work, you feel like you could conquer the world. Other days are not like that all. And while you can\u2019t prevent every unfortunate a.m. situation that might come your way, experts say there are a few things you can do to encourage your mornings in that direction so you can make the most out of the rest of your day, too. If you wake up energized, you\u2019re going to carry that energy through the rest of the day. Starting your morning with little \u201cwins\u201d (having an outfit picked out and ready to go, working out and leaving on time) primes your brain to work toward more \u201cwins\u201d and successes throughout the day. But if you start the morning off on the wrong foot, you\u2019re already behind, and that means you\u2019ll need to use the energy you do have to get to a better emotional state. Think back to how you calmed yourself down the last time you got caught in a traffic nightmare or public transport breakdown. Energy equals willpower and you only have so much at a given time,\u201d she says. So the more of it you use to recover from a train delay or an alarm-didn\u2019t-go-off morning, the less you have later for concentrating on a big project at work, family drama or whatever your day throws your way. Here are some of the things i do to start my day right; 1. Plan ahead! One of the most productive things you can do to start your day on the right foot should actually happen before you go to sleep the previous day. It doesn\u2019t need to be a minute-by-minute itinerary, but it should map out the major tasks or things you want to accomplish the next day and how you want to spend the first few hours of the day. 2. Resist the snooze Giving yourself a few extra minutes of slumber may seem like listening to your body, but in the long run you\u2019re probably doing more harm than good. That\u2019s because those 10 extra minutes of shuteye tend to be low-quality, light sleep since it\u2019s not long enough for your body to make it through another sleep cycle (which tends to take around 90 minutes). 3. Drink water Add lemon, ice or cucumber or just drink it straight up. We get dehydrated overnight (especially if nature calls and you\u2019re using the bathroom in the pre-dawn hours). A glass or two of H2O first thing helps replenish your body\u2019s hydration stores. It also starts your metabolism on the right foot (since the body relies on water to keep all your digestive processes running smoothly). 4. Meditate Quieting the brain is a time-honored way to be more creative, more contemplative and more in touch with oneself. Some people might not necessarily feel an energy boost from meditating, but because it helps us to think more effectively and efficiently, it should make for a much more productive day. 5. Exercise Muster the energy to start sweating first thing and it will reward you. Exercise releases endorphins; chemicals produced in the brain that help minimize pain and discomfort and increase wellbeing (essentially the body\u2019s own painkillers). Plus, endorphins can reduce stress hormones too, helping you start your day unfettered and in control. 6. Get outside in the sun Want to make that early workout work even harder for you? Do it outside in the sun. Getting sunlight first thing in the morning tells your body clock it\u2019s time to start the day. There\u2019s an entire field of research (chronobiology) that shows light is what triggers the body to stop producing melatonin, the hormone that tells the body to sleep, and be more alert. (And conversely, experts know that not being exposed to enough natural light throughout the day can trigger mood problems like depression and low energy.) 7. Eat breakfast Food is where your body gets energy so it makes sense that starting your day with food is one of the most energizing things you can do. Our metabolism works better earlier in the day. That means that the body is better able to turn the calories you eat into energy that you can use in the morning. If you don\u2019t follow a morning practice right now, how about creating one? Waking up in the morning might be a struggle, but taking responsibility for how you start your day could vastly improve not just your morning but the rest of your day as well. Every moment marks an opportunity to create a turning point. ",
