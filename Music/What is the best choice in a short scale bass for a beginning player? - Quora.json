            "answer_text": "What is the best choice in a short scale bass for a beginner player? I've played guitar for a lo-o-o-ong time. Not great but good enough to play in cover bands. A couple years ago I decided I wanted a bass. But I'm not a big guy and wanted something easy to play so I started my web research. Ended up with an Ibanez Mikro. Hey, if you're going for short scale, why not get the shortest? (28.6\" - that's right in the middle of typical baritone guitar scale length) I LOVE this bass. Great tones, easy fingering and didn't have to drop a wad of cash on it. Tone-wise (to me), it sounds like a standard size bass, doesn't sound short at all. The only other bass I might consider to replace it is a production (aka cheap) 5-string, headless, multi-scale (aka fan-fret) short scale, and that is something of a unicorn. Read up on Ibanez basses. Highly recommend. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite beginner bass brands are Squier, Yamaha, and Ibanez. I play Fender basses. All of mine are long-scale (34\u201d). But my first bass was a really terrible Kay copy of a Gibson EB-0. Both the EB-0 and the Kay clone of it are short-scale basses. Don\u2019t go that route. Get something decent. My son, who is 12, has an Ibanez Mikro bass. It\u2019s surprisingly good and surprising affordable. It even sounds decent. Those can be had for less than $200 USD and they are very small-hand friendly. Squier\u2019s Vintage Modified SS (short scale) line is only a little more expensive but well worth considering. ",
