            "answer_text": "Is Microsoft Windows or Mac OS better for video editing? When it comes to video editing, the operating system is not a significant factor in the choice. The main factors are the hardware and software available. It also depends what you mean by \u201cvideo editing\u201d. Are you making 110-minute features for cinema projection or do you just need to top and tail short clips for YouTube? You could do that on a phone\u2026 Reasons to choose Windows Serious video editing requires a lot of power, and Windows offers far more powerful hardware for much less money. This situation arose because Apple made some almighty blunders with the design of the trashcan-style Mac Pro, which was (a) impossible to upgrade or expand effectively; (b) overpriced; and (c) allowed to fall well behind current hardware standards. Apple has said it will have a usable Mac Pro out this year, but it still won\u2019t be cheap. Windows has a much greater choice of video editing software. Apple has an exclusive on Final Cut Pro, but upset professional users by dumbing it down and arbitrarily changing their workflows with Final Cut Pro X. Adobe Premier Pro runs much faster on Windows than it does on MacOS. It means you spend a lot less time sitting around waiting for renders to finish\u2026.  Note: The Aero 15X is a Core i7 gaming laptop from Gigabyte Reasons to choose Mac Your workflows are already based on Final Cut Pro and you are one of the people who stuck with it instead of switching to Windows. Macs are almost always more color-accurate than Windows machines out of the box, which saves time and avoids the aggravation of calibrating screens. You\u2019re already a Mac user and you don\u2019t mind spending from \u00a34,899 (starting price) to \u00a312,279 on an iMac Pro. (Yes, you really can spend \u00a312K on an all-in-one iMac.) Your video editing needs are not as advanced as that, and you\u2019d be fine with a 15-inch MacBook Pro costing only \u00a32,500 to \u00a34,500. Sure, you could buy a Microsoft Surface Book 2 or something instead, but those aren\u2019t a whole lot cheaper\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I ditched windows back in 2002. It was a hectic time for me and I could not get any work done because this toddler bad excuse of an OS demanded too much time and effort. I switched to a mac mini, and never looked back.. And found that iMovie was quite adequate for the purpose of cobbling together nice clips with relatively very little effort. The Moviemaker that came with windows crashed left, right and center. So close to the OP\u2019s original question: I don\u2019t know how Win10 handles video editing, but I\u2019ll stick to iMovie for as long as we\u2019re talking hobby editing. It does the job, and does it quite adequately. ",
