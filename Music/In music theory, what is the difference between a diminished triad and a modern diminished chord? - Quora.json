            "answer_text": "The difference between a diminished triad and diminished seventh chord is the addition of either the minor seventh (for half-diminished) or the diminished seventh (for fully-diminished) to the triad. The formulas are: root, m3, d5 for the triad, root, m3, d5, m7 for the half-diminished seventh chord root, m3, d5, d7 for the fully-diminished seventh chord. By Comparing full and half-diminished, we see that the intervals in the fully-diminished chord are symmetrical: C, Eb, Gb and Bbb are all a minor third apart. This symmetry means that any note in the chord could be considered the \u201croot\u201d thus allowing this chord to be a door to multiple keys or target chords- C dim can resolve to Db, F, A and Bb for example. There's also two diminished fifths inside- between C and Gb and between Eb and Bbb. So, a fully-diminished chord has two diminished fifths while a half-diminished chord (C Eb Gb Bb) has only one between C and Gb (Eb and Bb is a perfect fifth)- so, half the diminished fifths. The half-diminished chord can also be seen as a rootless dominant ninth chord where the root of the half-diminished is the major third of the ninth chord. So, Ab(9) has as the half-diminished as its upper structure. Fully-diminished can be seen as the upper part of a dominant b9 chord (Ab7b9). I'm not sure what the direct origin of these chords are (say the exact first historic usage of them) but they can be arrived at by stacking notes in thirds in scales- the major scale produces the half-diminished chord as the chord built on its seventh degree. Harmonic minor and melodic minor also produce these chords by regular stacking in thirds. ",

            "answer_text": "There's nothing more or less modern about diminished chords of any kind. Based on a given note, what you're referring to is that there is a single diminished triad but there are two diminished 7ths (which each have four notes). So with respect to C, we would have: Diminished triad C-Eb-GbFully diminished 7th: C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (yes that's B-double flat, which will sound like an A natural but should be spelled as B double flat)Half diminished 7th: C-Eb-Gb-BbWhat makes the half diminished 7th only HALF diminished is the fact that the last note is a MAJOR third above the penultimate note, not a minor third. Another way to think of that fact is that a fully diminished 7th is a fully symmetrical chord (every note is a minor third or a tritone away from every other note), whereas the symmetry breaks in the half-diminished, so it's not FULLY diminished, if that makes sense.
