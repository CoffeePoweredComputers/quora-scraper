            "answer_text": "I first saw BTS but it ended up that SF9 as my first stanning group and ult group. A friend of mine was and is an obsessed and hardcore ARMY. One day she told me about Kpop and BTS. She said how their music was so good, and how the members were hilarious and funny. I found them interested, so I gave it a try. I don't remember which song I first listened to, but I really liked it. The choreo, the rap, the vocals were impressive. So I continued listening to their music. I was curious abt their personality, my friend told me to watch \u201cWeekly Idol\u201d. I searched it up, but not on YT (I think it would be easier on YT, but yeye). I finally found a website with a long list of episodes. I didn't which one was correct. So I just picked one randomly, and guess whose episode it was? Yup, SF9. That's how I ended up as a Fantasy first. But BTS is my fav group, and the first kpop group I've listened to and they got me into K-pop.   Stan both groups!! Bye bye\ud83d\udc4b ",

            "answer_text": "It was SeoTaiji and The Boys. This group was the first considered 'kpop' since they went against the music that was normal at the time (political lyrics with Western 80\u2019s style music) instead of confirming to what was normal, SeoTaiji and his band went for a hip-hop style of music, combined with dancing, rapping, and singing. They debuted in 1991 and were active for 6 years. They influenced many people to start doing music, and because of them the Korean music industry started growing. After they disbanded, one of the members, Yang Hyun-Suk, founded and became chief executive officer of YG Entertainment, one of the biggest record companies in South Korea. BTS also covered one of their songs \u201ccome back home\u201d to show their appreciation and admiration towards the first kpop group. ",
