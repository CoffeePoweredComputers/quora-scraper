            "answer_text": "It was a matter of personal taste. The Stones were an answer to the overwhelming Beatlemania that pounded the ears of parents of the early-to-mid 60s. More influenced by the blues than other genres, the Stones came a close second behind John, Paul, George and Ringo, but were not the A-listers on most people\u2019s choices on the radio. It took time to establish them as the ground-breaking rock icons they are today. Among the peace and love of the late 60s, the Doors at least were honest about being influenced on what they saw by what they drank or inhaled, especially lead singer Jim Morrison. The Doors were not butterflies and peace and love. They were beat poetry put to music that was either serenaded or screamed. When they were coherent, Jim, along with John Densmore, Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, were a symphony of rebellion. This did not sit will with police who were hard pressed to keep the teens in check and keep Morrison from passing out. It all came to a head in a Miami club in 1969 when Morrison (may or may not have) exposed himself to the crowd. While awaiting trial and possible hard time, he was able to retreat to Paris, where he died July 3, 1971\u2026so they say. ",

            "answer_text": "These bands were before my generation. I like the Rolling Stones, though not as much as I do the Beatles; I find the latter\u2019s songs catchier and easier to hum along to. I enjoy the diversity of the vocal tracks\u2014John, Paul, and George each added their own distinct personalities to the music. The Stones have a more \u201cstatic\u201d sound. The Doors are another ball of wax entirely. I question if this band would have remained as relevant had Jim Morrison not died young and in such a dramatic, darkly-poetic way\u2014oh, in Paris under questionable circumstances that have generated countless conspiracy theories. I feel that Morrison\u2019s outrageous on- and off-stage personal largely propelled the band to fame. Because \u2026 just listen to the music without a video. Is it really that groundbreaking? The use of the organ thoroughly dates The Doors to a very specific time period, IMHO; they don\u2019t sound timeless. Unlike The Stone (and U2 and David Bowie), The Doors would not have translated well into the 1980s and beyond. I can see them playing somewhere in Vegas had Morrison lived\u2014a novelty act. I can make the opposite argument for the Stones. I heard them play in Cuba, and even the band\u2019s oldest tunes sounded fresh and new. ",
