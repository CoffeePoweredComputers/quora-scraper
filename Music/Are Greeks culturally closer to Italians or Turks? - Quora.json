            "answer_text": "There is no clear answer, and it really depends which Greeks and which Italians are you talking about.. If someone asks about Greek communities which once lived in Turkey then the answer would be \u201cit depends\u201d, and I will further explain bellow , but if you ask about mainland Greeks, then the answer is, by far with (South) italy. not only the southern and central Italians are the closest relatives, but to be fair Turkish people are not even the second closest to Greeks, (meanwhile others, like the rest of Southern Europeans and some people in eastern Europe like southern Balkans are closer to Greeks than Turkish people are). Greeks, and Italians (northern Italy excluded) share the same Greko-roman history as well as several common medieval (see Frankish kingdoms of Greece or Venetian colonies) and more recent influences, meanwhile with Turkey shared history and influences are more limited. Let me give some examples. Trastevere, in the old town of Rome:    In spite of having several differences with the old town of Athens, the two historical centers still share a similar \u201cEuro-Mediterranean\u201d vibe. The historical center of Athens:     Unlike the old town of Ankara, which,with its local Ottoman vernacular houses (and their definite altaic/turan background) doesn\u2019t seem to resemble either of the two southern European capitals:   Another good example that I read in a fellow Greek\u2019s comment, that I wish to \u201csteal\u201d, as I think it perfectly illustrates what I am saying: Kardamili and areopoli, two villages in Peloponnese:    Southern Italian towns:   I think that anyone would agree that in spite of some differences the two communities look pretty close with each other. And it\u2019s not only the architecture and other arts of the two places which share similarities, the people in general live in a very similar way, and their attitudes and thoughts towards life and family are very close. The two places share a similar family structure (see appendix), the most common drink in the two regions is wine, meanwhile the traditional cuisine of the two peoples is very close. I repeat, the traditional cuisine of Greece, which especially in southern Greece and Epirus it has much pasta, not streetfood like Gyros and other things that Greeks learnt as late as in 1930-1960 And since the villages of Kardamili and Areopoli were mentioned so much, both are nothing more than random villages of the Peloponnese, maybe with less modernistic influence than average. There are other parts of Greece with much more affinities to (especially South) Italy (and others less, but those with many commonalities with the Italian peninsula are also the most populated) On the other hand, this is the old town of Kutahya, a city in western Turkey:  Just like Ankara, the Turkic element in the town is clear, and the people there from several aspects do not live in a different way than other Turkic people (especially azerbaijani) live: Turkish people are muslims, their traditional family types were community families (unlike Greek/Southern European nuclear family) and their arts and architecture for the most part resemble Asia . Preveza\u2019s historical center, Greece:  it resemble Kutahya from any aspect? Does it resemble Birgi?  Birgi is an interesting village, as in spite of having a Greek originated name, its structure not only is completely alien to what you will see in Southern Greece (and in most of cases in northern Greece) but the Turkic/Altaic influence is clear. All historical centers in Turkey (except for eastern Turkey which has some more \u201cmiddle eastern\u201d influences) follow the same pattern. Exception are towns which were built and were almost exclusively inhabited by Greeks (like Alacati, or specific neighbors of Izmir). Talking about Greeks in these cities: L:ike it was previously said, all rules have exceptions, and if the general rule is that Greece and Greek people are (obviously) closer to other southern European people than to people of West Asia (especially when the latter have so much Central Asian heritage), there still are exceptions: More specifically, a (minor, but still not small) part of the Greek population, especially in the regions of Macedonia, Thrace and Thessaly, have ancestry from Greeks who used to live in Anatolia (what today is Turkey) until 1923, when they came here after the treaty of Lausanne. This part of Greeks brought their culture, habits and traditions in their new country, and part of these traditions, especially some dishes (like Gyros) were adopted mostly by touristic industry of Greece and to a lesser extent by folks. An average Greek would very likely have traditional Hillopites (a Greek tagliatelle-like pasta) with chicken for lunch, having no idea how Gyros is made, but in the mind of an average tourist Greece will always be associated with Gyros. Appendix: Some international rankings and populations\u2019 attitudes, mentality and social stucture of the three countries (Greece, Italy and Turkey) are depicted on the following maps. In most of cases Greece and Italy are closer with each other, in a few cases Greece is closer to Turkey or Italy is closer to Turkey: traditional family types of the world (emmanuel Todd, notice how Turks share the same family types with other Turkic people, and how Greeks share the same types with other Southern Europeans)  percentage of muslim population by country in the world Muslim % Population World Map (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Islam_percent_population_in_each_nation_World_Map_Muslim_data_by_Pew_Research.svg) percentage of Christian population by country in the world  Christianity/Islam Balance:  alcohol belts of Europe Alcohol belts of Europe - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_belts_of_Europe#/media/File:Alcohol_belts_of_Europe_(actual_consumption_in_2010).svg) climate change performance:  environmental performance:  Human development report World Map (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/2019_UN_Human_Development_Report.svg) corruption perceptions index File:Countries by Corruption Perceptions Index score (2019).png - Wikipedia Economic freedom (turkey and Italy from this aspect being closer with each other than each of them with Greece): Index of Economic Freedom - Wikipedia Global gender gap report:  ingelhart and welzel cultural map: Inglehart\u2013Welzel cultural map of the world - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglehart%E2%80%93Welzel_cultural_map_of_the_world#/media/File:Inglehart_Values_Map.svg) Lewis model cultural map:  More pics of Southern Greece       South Italy and South Spain:    Turkey:     with all that saying, we should not forget that Italy is a huge country, and hardly anything in Northern Italy (especially in regions like Lombardy), has any similarity with Greece. Maybe with the exception of Veneto due to historical connections, would ever make sense ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering, I would like to make clear that both countries influenced Greece, and to an even higher degree, both got influenced by Greece Italians, especially the southern part, were affected by both ancient and early medieval Greeks, the same time that mainly central and northern Italians affected late medieval Greece, through venetian and genovese occupation in Greece, and especially south mainland and the islands, during this time. And of course the 1800's and 1900's kingdom of Greece followed a South European pattern of development (including culture) Turks, when arrived in modern-day turkey, adopted some byzantine cultural elements, and the same time brought a (limited in Greece proper, but significant in Greeks of anatolia/turkey) middle eastern and limited central Asian influence in Greeks Exchanges between Italians and Greeks were a little easier than exchanges between Greeks and turks, something that makes sense, as the common religion and common European orientation made Greeks more open to Italian impact, and more distant from Turkish one, especially where both influences were available, as there were parts of Greece that technically never contacted turks (ionian islands, cyclades and peloponnese), and Greek populations in central and northeast Turkey which never contacted Italians (pontian Greeks etc). Turkey on contrary already had its central Asian influence, and was more open to middle eastern influence, something not applying that much for Greece As a result, it depends which part of Greece we are talking about. Peloponnese, sterea (central Greece) ionian islands and most of Aegean islands and Crete, around 55% of Greek population, are closer to Italy, with cyclades, ionian islands and mani in South peloponnese having zero influence from Turkey. Anatolian Greeks on contrary, maybe excluding Greeks from izmir who were heavily influenced by Italy, are significantly closer to Turkey, and some of them (like pontians from northeast turkey, whom I already mentioned) have probably nothing in common with Italy. These Greeks, both with partially and fully Anatolian ancestry, make up 30% of Greek population, and the vast majority of them lives in northern Greece The remaining population that I didn't mention (native northern Greeks with no Anatolian ancestry, probably 15%-20% of the population) are probably slightly closer to Turkey Therefore I will agree with the majority of answers here, which imply that Greece is closer to Italy, because the majority (but not significant majority) of Greek population is closer to Italy, however, a strong minority of Greeks are closer to Turkey Anyway, for comparison of the two influences, I would suggest the lyrics of the following folk Greek song :D Italian and Turkish words are explained bellow \u0395\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c7\u03c4\u03ac \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u2019 \u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ae \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03af \u039a\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03b5 \u03a4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u2019 \u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ae \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03af \u039a\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2\u039c\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9 \u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03ce\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03a4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u2019 \u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ae \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03af Italian Turkish worth watching also  ",

            "answer_text": "Regardless of the (if any) correct answer, we can safely assume that modern Greeks tend to be culturally closer to Italians than the Greeks of 100\u2013110 years ago. Factors, such as more than 35 years of EU membership, better established democratic institutions, and respect for law, shifted Greek culture towards Western Europe, and therefore also, towards Italy in the last decades. That was, however, not always like this. Simply because, roughly before 1912, Ottoman Turkey and northern regions of Greece were full with Turks, Greeks, Turkish speaking Greeks in central Turkey (some of which were Christian Turks), Greek speaking Turks (some of which were Muslim Greeks), and many more difficult-to-define ethnic/religious groups. Following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, however, these culturally and linguistically diverse ethnic groups was categorized according to religion only. All Orthodox Christians in Turkey were categorized as Greeks, and were sent to Greece, while all Muslims in Greece were sent to Turkey. Consequently hundreds of thousands of newly defined Greeks brought bits and pieces of Turkishness to Greece, while a similar number of newly defined Turks brought bits and pieces of Greekness to Turkey. As a result of this population mixture, many middle aged Turks in the Aegean Turkey spoke Greek (in addition to Turkish) until early 1960s. Similarly, Turkish speaking Greeks constituted a majority in several neighbourhoods in Athens, Pireaus and Thessaloniki during the same time period. Hence, I cannot say with certainty whether contemporary Greeks are closer to Turkish- or Italian culture. Well, my gut feeling is that the Greek culture of today is a bit closer to Italy then to Turkey, even though it really depends on region, as some parts of Greece, have experienced little to no Turkish rule. However, as I tried to explain in previous paragraphs, the proximity between Greek- and Turkish cultures was even bigger few decades ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Greece is definitately a mediterrenean country. There are similarities with both countries, however, whatever influence Ottoman empire had on Greek people, declined very swiftly after the rapid shift towards western culture following the liberation from the Ottomans. Every year it has been distancing from Turkish culture more and more while adopting at the same pace western culture. Can this be seen today? Definately. Turkish people despite having adopted mediterrenean elements within the society (which always was the dominant element of Greek people thus in a sense Turkish became more Greek than Greeks becoming \u201ccentral Asian\u201d) they still remain largely eastern in many aspects in the same amount that Greeks are western. In Greek culture today, there can be seen some \u201ceasternism\u201d which is what really makes the difference between Greece and Italy. Greeks and Italians have thousands of years of similar way of dressing, traditions, architecture and culture. Look at ancient Romans, how influenced they were and how much they adopted Greek culture (and it wasn\u2019t just them). Even in medieval times, Romaic Greeks were very influencual and if you travelled in both countries you would see very identical dressing and architecture. Later it was Italians and ultimately today that are the most influencial. Italy and Greece are western-mediterrenean-European countries and the people are similar, Turkey is eastern-mediterrenean-*central* (Turkic element) Asian (and Asian in general) country and only the people who live in the western Turkey have similar characteristics to Greeks who are largely Balkanian converts rather than people of central Asian Turkic tribes who arrived early in the east. I mean, \u201cTurkish\u201d is a very loose term. A Turkish-speaking muslim of Greek descent can be Turkish. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a wrong order or statement. You cannot call a culture that pre-existed from both, where it fits closer to one of those modern cultures and countries in history. Its the vise verse. Which cultures adopted more elements from the Hellenics\u2026 The turks or the Italians. Its a complex answer, because most of the sweets and foods in turkey are affected by the Byzantine empire. Byzantine Empire was a Hellenized but under Roman rulership big central city. Italians as part of the Roman Empire, because as many of you know, the Roman Empire expanded in the entire western Europe (even Brits was Romans). Hellas was excluded from the Roman Empire, Romans didnt want Hellenics to be called as Romans and we never been Romans. But they had the control of the fallen Hellenic empire. They called Hellenics as Romioi its a nick name as a \u201cleftover\u201d of the Byzantine empire, thats what Romioi means. Many of you today confuse the word Romioi with the word Roman. In addition, Roman Empire didnt do well with philosophy and the temples of Hellas, they adopted the architecture, but they also implemented the Zionistic gods, combined them all together into the 12(+1) gods of Olympus. Some of you may already know, the 12 was not a Hellenic religion, temples in ancient Hellenic empire was today Universities! Rome shut down temples, misteries of the SUN/Apollo, burned and destroyed knowledge. Killed most of the philosophers, lots of genocides. Turks didnt adopted architecture and belief system, Hellas represents the SUN, Turks represent the Moon. So Italians adopted way of dressing code, architecture maybe some foods, but not as much as Turks did in the food section. Hellenics also adopted romaic food habbits, like patatoes, pasta, etc. (Did you know that we Hellenics didnt eat patatoes 200 y ago?) But both Romans and Turks did hate everything about Hellas, I may remind you in modern history the deadly hate of french which they destroyed Sparta, (Furmon) in his personal calendars that are saved even today he says : I erased them, I destroyed them, I made them forget who they are (and stuff like that) and he was part of the Roman empire. The reason is, WE represent the SUN, we dont give a tomato for their gods the moon gods. All except Hellenics have a different perception of the meaning of what GODS or GOD is. Yes, today religions all of them do promote the Zionistic meaning of GODS and GOD, but we are still the only country by a huge % especially those who have a basics education as a background, that do understand the whole difference between and our character is affected with the Hellenistic way, in a way that you cannot find elsewhere. I mean all Hellenics say that we are children/descendants of GOD (not chosen\u2019s, not specials, not lets kill all the rest and we are the ones), we don\u2019t make any competition with any, in order to believe or understand who we are. We feel blessed and calm infernally about who we are. we all say that \u201cwhen we have to speak to GOD we stand in our feet\u201d, not begging, not something less, even Gods fear Ellines\u2026 It\u2019s a different perception that is hard to describe. Only the generations that couldn\u2019t make it to educate themselves because they kept my country under war climax for nearly 2000 years! Only those generations was easily manipulated in terms of belief and obedience. Education was hard and those generations of Ellines didn\u2019t have the chance to know who they are, that was the goal of Romans and Turks! But who saw a Hellenic Mother and didn\u2019t fear, who saw Ellines united and didn\u2019t run away! Romans in order to rule my country they knew that if we become united they are goners, so what they did was to keep every town, every village separate from each other, NOT TO BE united! They bifurcate/divided the population in order never to be united. That methodology exists event doay but with dogmas (politics, science, work classes, money) a division in everything. So its a very complex question, which culture adopted which. Food surely Turks from the Byzantine empire and Byzantine empire was Hellenistic food with elements from Anatolia (spices, etc), architecture is Roman empire and are Italians included. ",

            "answer_text": "Which of our two former colonial powers do we resemble? Both I would say and it depends on what parts of Greece and Greek culture you compare with which parts of Italian and Turkish culture. The parts of Greece that were under Venice for long, especially the Ionian islands, feel at times as lost parts of Italy. There are villages in Corfu like Danilia that fell plucked out of Italy. You could also claim that this is also true for parts of Greece and Turkey, minus that the parts of Turkey we resemble the most in landscape are those from where our ancestors were expelled during the genocide and after the population exchange. Even more so when you consider that in Ionia and Thrace Turkey settled exchanged refugees from Greece and other Balkan countries, and their descendants do keep practices active as opposed to parts of the interior. We have been seeing more recently as Turkey becoming freer and richer adopting several practices that we associate with our own country, like eating more lamb and partying all night. Still though Greece is not a Christian Turkey as some Turks see us. We are country with various issues with the law and order, but an established democracy with a military subservient to the political class that solves its issues through polls and courts rather than through brute force. Also Greece lacks at least indigenous organized crime, we have trouble with the organized part. We do read from time to time of bad practices in Italy, especially the southern part, which remind us of bad practices in Greece. This is why I would say that we are more related to Italy than Turkey, though that can change if Turkey is to become a more democratic and pluralistic country. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. Because of their geographical location, Greek culture (which helped shape the world) seeped into both in differing ways. They inspired the Romans as far as cultural identity, the law and the arts and they cross culturally exchanged with the Turks on all of those fronts, too. The largest divide as far as culture is concerned was religion because Constantinople, the largest trading city in the Middle Ages and in Roman times, was the first major European city where Christianity was accepted. King Constantine shaped (almost literally) what we now know to be the Bible and was the first convert of major note to the religion of Christ (at the time without a name), despite living in a predominantly Muslim territory. So if you visit Turkey, you will find, like Israel and Palestine, a mix of both and largely (but disputably) great religious tolerance. Greece on the other hand (or Hellas) became orthodox Roman Catholic and the Roman empire adopted Christianity and modified it (with the aim of conquering most of what we now call Europe - from the Visigoths to the Druids) to suit their own aims. So Greece and Greek culture from time immemorial helped to cross pollinate the foundation on which modern day Europe stands, from food to religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on some things: What precisely is culture? Language? Religion? Costumes? Traditions? Music? Dances? Cusine? Well actually culture is all of them. I see many answers here trying to differentiate culture from what really is ( Culture is certainly NOT architecture or food. But definetately it touches much other elements ). I\u2019ll try to be as objective as I can. Let\u2019s see each category of the above cultural sectors one by one shall we? Language: which one? Definately Italian is the answer. Greek and Italian are both Indo-European languages, they have common accents ( not the same or identical but common ), much loanwords from eachother, easy languages to learn if you are Greek or Italian ( being a Greek that observed his friend studying Italian, they were relatively easy since both languages have the same mindset and much common words ) and the same gestures when we are talking. Turkish? Not even close, Turkish is an Ural-Altaic language with almost no connection to the Greek, almost no loanwords between them ( Greece has only 200 Turkish words and Turkey only 200 Greek ) while the only place in Greece Turkish is still spoken ( not as a primary language ) is Western Thrace which has some population that learn Turkish at the mionotiko sholio ( \u039c\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf/ minority school ) So Italy: 1 Turkey : 0 Religion: which one? Definately Italian. Italian predominant religion ( even though both contried secularize by the time passing ) is Catholic christianism while Greek predominant religion is Orthodox christianism. See that both are christianic countries? They are both christian sub-groups however they have both the same God, messiah and the holy spirit. They only argue about minor things like: where does holy spirit comes from? And they are written in different languages ( Latin and Greek ). Turkish? Nope. Turkish official/predominant religion is Sunni Islam and the people are mostly muslim with very small christian minorites. Although both are Abrahamic religions, we can\u2019t compare two sub categories of christianism with a sub category of Islam. Greece has a small muslim minority in western Thrace and Turkey has very small christian minorities widespread in the mainland. So Italy : 2 Turkey: 0 Costumes: Now that\u2019s really difficult to answer. Both Italy and Turkey share much commonalities with Greece. From the one point of view you could say only south Italy shares similarities with Greece but that\u2019s a no. Venice and other Italian states ruled Greek islands for centuries and even today we can see some Italian costumes alive in Greece ( Vendetta for example is known in all of Greece but it is still an alive tradition in Crete ) so both parts of Italy are relatively close with Greece. However if you also claimed that only Western Turkey is similar to Greece you are wrong here too. Black sea ( known as Pontic region ) region of Turkey had large Greek populated areas that had their first language as Greek and held much of what we call nowdays \u201c Greek \u201c costumes ( I am saying it as \u201c Greek \u201c because the origins of those traditions are mixed and you never know where they precisely came from ). So it\u2019s really difficult but I\u2019ll give both 0,5 points so Italy: 2,5 while Turkey: 0,5 Traditions: Well the above answer goes for that sector too so another 0,5 points for both so Italy:3 Turkey: 1 Music: It depends the region. South Greece, islands, Corfu and Ionian islands and maybe some Peloponesean regions have mostly Italian like music while Thrace and Anatolian Greeks have mostly Turkish like music. So aain 0,5 and 0,5 so Italy: 3,5 while Turkey: 1,5 Dances: Now here is definately a Turkish win. All of Greece has mostly circular dancing something which is almost non existant in Italy. So Italy: 3,5 while Turkey: 2,5 Cusine: The same as the above. Even though there are some visible Italian influence in Greek cusine still Turkish wins a lot. So Italy: 3,5 while Turkey : 3,5 Now however there are also some other things like: Lifestyle: Italy wins here. Of course Turkish peoplehave similar lifestyle to Greek ones but being a majority muslim country sets your lifestyle a little bit different than that of two christian nations. So Italy: 4,5 while Turkey : 3,5 History: Yes history -wether some people like it or not - is a significant part of culture. Greece has centuries more interraction with Italy rather than Turkey so Italy wins here too Italy: 5,5 Turkey: 3,5 Architecture: Well here is a tie. Turkey and Greece share a huge Eastern Roman influence over their architecture. We can find both churches and Ottoman buildings in Greece that resemble eahcother much and remind people the Eastern Roman times. However that is mostly found in Northern Greece since as Southern as you go you can see more Venetian castles/monuments ect. So it\u2019s a tie Italy: 6 Turkey: 4 Finally, society: Now that\u2019s a difficult topic. I would say that all of Greek society - both South and North - ( because some people like to highlight northern Greek similarities with Turkey so they can claim they are different , something which is mostly wrong/faux, keep saying that Macedonian and Thracian regions of Greece resemble Turkey more something which is a lie since apart from architecture, they have nothing more in common with Turks than other Greeks do ) resembles the Italian one. Both are christian and have pretty much the same values, both are more open-minded than their neighboring ones ( Greece: Turkish and Slavic, Italy: Arabic and Slavic ) and both have the same big celebrations: Christmas, Carnival ( Apokries in Greek ), Easter ect. While the biggest commonality between Greek and Turkish cultures, is the values so in finale Italy is: 7 Turkey is: 4 And I guess that Italian number will evolve since both countries are members of EU and have great relations with eachother ",

Obviously after at least a century of closer ties with Western Europe Greece is much closer in values and culture to Europe and to Italy, with which there has always been a close relationship, with Venetian and Genoese ruins all over the country and the colonial rule of the Dodecanese in the first half of the XX century (Rhodes and Leros have very nice rationalist building from the period). In the Ionian islands the accents and the traditions are very similar to Italian traditions, and there is also where the majority of Greek Catholic live. However, the hundreds of years under Turkish occupation left a huge influence, maybe less visible in buildings (also because many Ottoman buildings were tore down) but still present. For instance in food, where many tastes and mixes are very similar to Turkish cousine. Most of the sweets are basically the same that are found in Turkey and other former Ottoman-ruled areas. Or also some traditions and folklore character like the puppet Karagiozis. ",

However, the most important among the above, is the DNA matching between Greeks and Italians. A couple of weeks ago, I came across this Journal Article Genetics of the peloponnesean populations and the theory of extinction of the medieval peloponnesean Greeks For those who don\u2019t know, this literature has looked at whether Greeks from the Peloponnesean region were/are related to Slavic people, due to a offensive and overly unscientific theory proposed by the not so \u2018\u2019academic\u2019\u2019 Fallmerayer who believed that Greeks, specifically: \u2018\u2019the medieval Peloponneseans were totally extinguished by Slavic and Avar invaders and replaced by Slavic settlers during the 6th century CE.\u2019\u2019 (Fallmerayer) Such unscientific claim that is not supported by any evidence, has been denied for centuries ago and even the above study came to cancel this contradictory claim for once again, with pure evidence. The researchers compared the genetic contribution (DNA) between specific Peloponnesean regions with the slavic populations (Russians, Belarusians, Polish, Ukranians) and with Italians and other European populations (French, Basque and Andalusians). And the results showed that the Greek DNA matched significantly with the Italians, 85.4% to 96.1% with French 39.1% to 42.6% and with Andalusians 53.8% to 60.5%. Whereas; Greek DNA showed a lower to zero significance with slavic populations, e.g., Russians 0.9% to roughly 11% and more lower percentages where revealled in the study with other slavic populations. And these results completely disproved Fallmerayer and every other hateful nationalist which likes the narrative of \u2018\u2019Greeks are Africans and were completely wiped out from Greece, centruries ago.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, I\u2019d choose the Italians as we match significantly higher with them in DNA and with other aspects of our personalities, cultures etc. Of course my second option is the Turks too, however we have a lot of other differences and difficulties such as modern day politics which make it difficult for making peace. In theory yes, but in practice\u2026hardly no. Source: Genetics of the peloponnesean populations and the theory of extinction of the medieval peloponnesean Greeks ",

Eastern Roman Empire was an integral part of Greece. Ottoman rule in Greece was unpleasant. Greeks became impoverished and uneducated. Turkey is also Muslim and speaks an Altaic language. Greece is a modern democracy and not a hybrid regime. We also dont jail our journalists and ban wikipedia. Turkey is foreign in its geographical area. Greece has been in the region since 3,000bc.

After that it became part of the expanding Roman Republic together with a lot of other former \u201cGreek\u201d City States on the southern Italian peninsula. The Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire saw much of the \u201cancient Greek\u201d culture as a role model and adapted much of it into their own culture, took over the Gods (just renamed them) and so on. But all of this have nothing to do with the question when you look upon it with modern eyes but it have all to do with the question if you look at it in a long term historical view and understand that the question really should be labeled \u201cWhy is there cultural resemblances between Greece and Italy\u201d instead.
