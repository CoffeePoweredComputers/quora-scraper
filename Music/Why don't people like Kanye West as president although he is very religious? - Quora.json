            "answer_text": "is that a reason to like someone? Because they are \u2018very religious\u2019? For me someone who puts a 2000 year book above common sense, who tries to tell people what to do in this modern world because they\u2019ve interpreted an ancient book in a very different way from someone else in order to impose their views over others actually isn\u2019t a recommendation to vote for them. But hey, I\u2019m British and having someone who waves their religion in your face isn\u2019t actually a good way to get elected in the UK. ",
