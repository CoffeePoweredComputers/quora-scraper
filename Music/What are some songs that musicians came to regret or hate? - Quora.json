            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve played in many cover bands during the last 40 years. The biggest requests back in the 70s and 80s were \u201cFree Bird\u201d by Lynryd Skynyrd, and \u201cCocaine\u201d by Eric Clapton. We\u2019ll still get the occasional request for \u201cFree Bird\u201d, but it\u2019s usually coming from someone who is just trying to funny and annoying at the same time. But we played them so many times we eventually flat-out refused to play them any longer. Walk into a guitar store back then, and all you\u2019d hear was \u201cSmoke On The Water\u201d by Deep Purple, and \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d by Led Zeppelin. And they were usually played very badly by every wannabe guitarist that ever lived. Having played in my share of wedding bands over the years, we\u2019ve gotten quite sick of playing the following songs: \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d by Van Morrison; \u201cMustang Sally\u201d by Wilson Pickett; \u201cThe Electric Slide\u201d by Marcia Griffiths; \u201cBrick House\u201d by The Commodores; and \u201cPlay That Funky Music\u201d by Wild Cherry. I\u2019m sure there were others that have thankfully been erased from my memory! More recently (in the last 10 years) I\u2019ve really gotten sick of playing \u201cSanteria\u201d by Sublime. Thank God we don\u2019t play that one anymore! There are sooooo many songs that you just get sick of hearing that were force-fed by radio stations (I\u2019m old, we didn\u2019t have Spotify, iTunes, playlists, etc). So many songs, too many to mention, where as soon as you hear the first notes come over the radio you immediately changed the station!!! Even songs that you once loved you\u2019d become sick of. Some songs you get over and then enjoy them later. Others you become sick of for the rest of your life! LOL ",

Of all things\u2026 The title and intent came not from them, but from their manager at the time Bud Prager. And the fallout was immediate; Mustaine reportedly \u201cthrew the doors to their studio open and wretched.\u201d As he put it, he envisioned \u201cKISS in spandex trying to justify \u2018I Was Made For Loving You\u2019\u201d, and he was horrified. Drummer Jimmy Degrasso openly despised the song. And so did everyone else in the end.)CRADLE OF FILTH - \u201cFrom the Cradle to Enslave\u201d (unlike the above entry, this is a song that was created and masterminded by the band itself, but thst didn't save it from being a song front man Dani Filth actively loathes. To his credit it's not a very good track; they've done better before and after this, and the whole EP this came from is probably the worst thing they ever made, but the unfortunate issue here is that this is, even today I believe, their closing live song. As Dani himself puts it: \u201cWe have to play it at every gig... I'd like to erase it, so I wouldn't have to play it again. After a while you just want to play something different. There's something about the hook that just strikes a chord of fear down my spine.\")",
