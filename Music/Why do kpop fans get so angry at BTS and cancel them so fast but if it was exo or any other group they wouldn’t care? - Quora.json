            "answer_text": "Oh come on. Exo is dragged for everything as well and was for many many years. It\u2019s not right, the hate is not right but hating band with no reason is not exclusive for BTS. As an Exo fan I saw people hating on them for litterally everything, taking words out of context (quite similar to recent situation with Suga but it was during illegaly recorded private talk with fan), cutting parts of the video to prove one member is hating on the other, looking too \u201ccold\u201d, wearing wrong clothes, meeting wrong people, not smiling after taking a photo, playing a game in private with people who were coursing maybe they coursed as well I don\u2019t remember (it was absolutly illegaly recorded) and milions more ridiculous things, some things were totally made up by antis in some it was alright to critique but hate got massivly out of proportions. When I watch them sometimes I get anxious when they say something even if it\u2019s nothing bad just because I know there might be someone who will figure out how to use it against them. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not only BTS and Exo problem but in general most of bands and the most popular band the worst the situation gets. For years Exo was main target among boygroups cause they were the most popular so I know what you feel now that BTS is the main target. It\u2019s really sad. Exo still gets lots of hate for nothing tho and even if they do something once in a long time that could be considered more controversial it\u2019s blown up much more in comparison to other bands just as in BTS case. That\u2019s the price that comes with popularity in kpop, fanwars are getting to the level that the hate is put on artists without thinking that it might actually affect a real person. It\u2019s awful. I hope people would stick to constructive criticism if something idols do might be harmful and in other situations just stick to supporting their favs without looking for bad intentions in other actions where there wasn\u2019t any.

Jungkook got into a small simple car crash and blinks and exols flipped out and called him a murderer and signed petitions to get him in jail. But now there\u2019s this one kid (dont know who he is, sorry) who was literally drunk driving and could\u2019ve killed someone, and everyone\u2019s like \u201cawe baby don\u2019t apologize\u201d the double standards are ridiculous. Why didn\u2019t the internet flip out like they did about jungkook? The same way they found out Taehyung vapes and they started calling him a crackhead but when Sehun or Taemin smokes \u201cITS SO HOT OMGGG\u201d. According to other kpop stans as long as its not BTS you\u2019re okay in their book\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ",
