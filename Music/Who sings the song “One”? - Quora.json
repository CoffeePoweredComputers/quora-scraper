Al Kooper recorded it for his album I Stand Alone in 1969. Johnny Farnham had a top 40 hit in Australia with it that same year. Three Dog Night recorded it for their first album in 1968 and had a top five hit in the U.S. and Canada in 1969. One, written by Bono, was recorded by U2 for their 1991 album Achtung Baby. It was released as a single in 1992 and proceeds went to benefit AIDS research. It went to number one in the U.S., Canada and Ireland. ",
