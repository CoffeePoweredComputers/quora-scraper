            "answer_text": "It's not a question of how long it's a question of how old are you? the vibrato comes with puberty but sometimes it takes even longer than that. You have to just allow it to come and once it's there, you can start using it. It's very much breath related. My experience with vibrato is leave it alone and it'll be just fine. The only time you actually work on a vibrato is if it's too wide or it's too thin. You just need to allow your voice to find its own vibrato and then go from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, during ~25 years my vibrato was artificial. I just tried to repeat what I hear from recordings \u2026 Then it took a few years to forget the wrong habits with professional vocalists and to find my own vibrato which do come from the breath and the vocal chords control. Forgetting wrong habits took longer then to find the fresh vibrato. Bottom line: do not try to find vibrato yourself but exercise with vocal teacher. Depending on your facilities it may take ~1\u20132 years. ",
