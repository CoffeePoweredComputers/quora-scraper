            "answer_text": "They are there to mitigate the whiplash effect of being rear ended. They are almost all adjustable, if you read the manual. For my F-150, you pull forward and can hear the ratchet of the headrest lock as it comes forward. At any click, let go and it will stay. Pull it to the forward limit and let go and it will spring back to the aft limit. It is also adjustable up and down. Best adjustment is such that it is NOT hitting your head in normal driving. Calling it a headrest was a bad way to name it. Its a whiplash suppression device. ",

At the time you could also buy a plastic kiddy steering wheel which fitted with a sucker onto the rear of the front seats, complete with horn and plastic column gear change so that your unbelted child could play driver on the back seat, scary now but perfectly normal then.
