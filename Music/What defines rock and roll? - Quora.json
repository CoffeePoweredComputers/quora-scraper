            "answer_text": "Rock and roll has a very distinct sound to it, it\u2019s so obvious when something is rock that most people can hear a rock song from any subgenre and be able to say that it\u2019s rock. \u201cRock and roll\u201d usually refers to classic rock and 70s/80s pop rock rather than more modern things like heavy metal and screamo rock. Even modern rock and roll usually isn\u2019t called rock and roll, but just rock or punk rock. There are a few ways you can identify a classic rock song. InstrumentsThis is probably the easiest way to identify a rock band. A typical rock band will have a vocalist/lead singer, a drummer, a guitarist, and a bassist. A lot of the time there\u2019s also more than one of these. Other genres tend not to have all of those. Also, because classic rock was around before a lot of modern technology, it doesn\u2019t use electronic backing music very much. Of course there are keyboard and whatnot, but there isn\u2019t any of those computer-generated sounds that are in a lot of modern music. There also isn\u2019t an audible beat in the background of most classic rock like there is in modern hip hop and rap. LyricsSo this one\u2019s a little harder, but classic rock tends to have very different sounding lyrics than modern music, whether it be modern rap/hip hop and pop or modern rock. Things were a lot more censored back then, and since most classic rock comes from the 60s though early 90s, there is hardly any profanity in classic rock, and lyrics aren\u2019t very sexual. There are a lot of classic rock love songs, but they focus less on people being sexy and more on actually being romantically in love with someone. And yes, while a lot of classic rock songs do reference sex, there aren\u2019t many lyrics that actually talk about being horny or having sex. Classic rock songs also talk about other things that aren\u2019t as common in modern music, like politics, the love of music, and deep, metaphorical stuff. Even modern rock bands have drifted away from extremely metaphorical stuff and rather have lyrics that have one clear meaning. VocalsThere isn\u2019t autotune. That wasn\u2019t around during the time when most classic rock music was produced. Autotune was invented in 1997, so almost all classic rock bands never used it. So that\u2019s a good indication of a classic rock song. Most modern rock bands, or at least the ones that I like, don\u2019t use it either, but a lot of popular modern music does use it. These are a few of the most obvious ways to identify a classic rock song. Of course, some bands that are still around, some of which are also pretty new, that fit this description. The Foo Fighters formed in 1994, they\u2019re still touring, and they have all the traits mentioned above. Greta Van Fleet only recently debuted, but their music is already being compared to that of Led Zeppelin, and they fit the traits mentioned above as well. This should be able to help you the majority of the time, though. Rock on, -Quora\u2019s favorite sssssnotelek \ud83d\udc0d ",

            "answer_text": "Rock and roll emerged in the mid-1950s as a mashup of country and rhythm and blues. The cross-pollenization of music genres aimed at white and black audiences respectively made it quite exciting to its fans, and fearsome to its detractors. The distinguishing characteristics of R&R were a steady, driving rhythm, simple arrangements that a small band could play, and an emphasis on performance quality. When early fans were asked what they liked about it, they usually mentioned \u201cthe beat.\u201d The sound of R&R came to be defined by the electric guitar, an instrument that gave a single musician the power of multiple acoustic players. The songs gave singers and musicians room to express themselves in their own unique style. In fact style was more important than proficiency in performance. Rock eventually evolved and split into sub-genres. At times polyrhythms and odd time signatures came into and out of favor. Horns and orchestration likewise were introduced, faded in popularity, and came back. Synthesizers and computer-generated sounds came on the scene. Performers with minimal musical skill could succeed, as could expert musicians. Today rock has faded in popularity. While old fans and a few subgenres like heavy metal keep it afloat, younger people have mostly moved on to other music, most importantly hip-hop. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether it will become a small niche in the music world, or be rediscovered by future generations. ",
