            "answer_text": "For regular acoustic piano, I've had best experience with is Safwan Matni's Prova, though far more sophisticated options exist. I love the tone of Prova, which is the first priority for me, rather than multi-sample realism or mic'ing options or somesuch.   Remember though, for every person that shares my opinion there is someone who thinks it's crazy. Here's an anti-Prova review:  Terrible. I don't know what everyone is raving about. CV Piano, Piano One, Maestro Concert Grand, Amore Grand Piano are all great free alternatives. Could have been better if it had some release samples. And it isn't that I haven't heard the very nice CVPiano, or can't understand that reviewer's sophisticated opinion. I just disagree. Prova has a certain tone that really works for me. Finding what works for you will likely be a similar process. ",

            "answer_text": "I havent found any fairly good piano VST; having searched a lot. So far, these are the best free ones; they are present in this list:  VST Piano - Free VST plugin instruments - Page 1 Tascam piano (in the page 7) MDA pianoEVM grand PianoI find though, that all of these are incomplete because a very nice feature of real pianos, is the sympathetic resonance from one string to another: the timbre of a key will be different depending on which other keys are not damped. It is easy to test by pressing a key slow enough, so it doesn't sound, and keep it pressed (that makes the damp to be released), and then, play the same key in other octave loudly; release the loudly played key, but not the silent-undamped key. If the note remains sounding, it is because the silent & undamped string gathered vibration by sympathy from the loud key, that is damped. If the piano is well modeled; strings will gather big amounts of vibration from other strings that are an octave; a bit less from fifths and sevenths, a bit less from the fifth or seventh of the fifth or seventh, and so on.I have found that the Pianoteq piano has a good math model of piano sound, with this feature included; but is not free.
