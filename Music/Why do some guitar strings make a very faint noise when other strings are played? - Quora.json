            "answer_text": "There is a phenomenon called the overtone or harmonic series, which is that each string creates a series of overtones above its fundamental tone. You can activate these harmonics by lightly touching a node point on the string and plucking with the right hand. The node points are found at each division of the string- divide the string into half, thirds, fourths, fifths etc and you'll get strong harmonics. These tones, up to 8 parts (we can go further than 8 parts) form what's essentially a dominant seventh chord. These tones are very faint but the relative volume of these sounds are heard as timbre or tone color. On your low E string we get the notes as follows: E E B E G# B D E (the first E is the fundamental). If you play any of these notes on another string, that same note is activated sympathetically on the open E string. Since we use equal tempered tuning, some of the higher overtones don't match exactly in tune. For example, the G# will not be so strong if you play an equal tempered G#. If you tune the high E string slightly flat and play the G# on that string at the 4th fret, you'll hear the G# on the low E as being much fuller and stronger sounding. If you play a note that's not in the harmonic series of the open string you will not activate that string sympathetically. Your other strings will have their own series based on their pitch and harmonics can also be activated on fretted notes according to the same principle. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a sympathetic resonance: strings will resonate with frequencies on other strings. Some instruments like sitar and kora emphasize sympathetic notes, while on guitar they can be distracting. As if you don't have enough things to do with your hands, eliminating unwanted harmonics requires damping or muting strings that don't sound right. I either use the sympathetic notes or mute with my thumb, palm, or fretting finger(s). ",
