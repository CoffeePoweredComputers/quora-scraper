            "answer_text": "It is possible that \u201chalf of your library\u201d, was in fact released on a very small scale, or the music was intended to be for underground use, which basically means very less promotion for the upcoming music, and no possible way to purchase it from some well-known music store. For such cases, I highly recommend this app called MP3Tag. It\u2019s an all-in-one solution to make your music library look pretty! Either you can use this app to manually find artwork and embed it into the music file, or you can run the files through the app to look it up on an online music database like Discogs, Musicbrainz, or Amazon (these databases are your best chance to find information about your music. Beware though, your music must be well-tagged for the app to be effective in finding artwork.) Happy tagging! :D ",
