So here\u2019s a list of songs I find to be fucking amazing !! Perfect - The The (the lyrics in this song are so powerful) Only a shadow - The Cleaners From Venus Say Anything - Girl In Red (works great if you\u2019re a sad, lonely lesbian like me Night Drive - Part Time Desire - Current Joys (oh god I\u2019ve wept to this on repeat) Freaks - Surf Curse (SOB to this) And of course, you can\u2019t be sad without The Smiths !! Rubber Ring and the infamous There Is a Light that Never Goes Out !! My favorite band of all time is Crywank. All of their songs are sad. I love their album \u201cEgg on Face. Foot in mouth. Wriggling Wriggling Wriggling\u201d because of the fact it\u2019s so whimsical with melancholic undertones. You\u2019re welcome :) ",
