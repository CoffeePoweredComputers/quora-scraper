            "answer_text": "Absolutely! In addition to its many unforgettable musical moments, virtuosic singing, abundant sex and violence, and big plot twists, Rigoletto is a very \u201ctight\u201d opera: that is to say, there are very, very few dull moments. Many operas were written for people with very different expectations about attention span than we have as modern people. They were for composed by people living in 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, who had no cell phones, movies, TVs, usually no radios, no recorded entertainment of any kind. Oftentimes they were composed for people who were not at all expected to sit still or be quiet! Verdi\u2019s audiences saw the opera house the way modern Americans see a baseball stadium, or the rest of the world sees a soccer match: a wild venue, where many of the people watching would be drunk; coarse criticism would rain down upon underperformers, elation would greet excellence, and, occasionally, sublime beauty could be seen. Handel\u2019s audiences would eat, drink, and talk DURING the opera\u2019s recitative sections, paying attention only to the arias. So it\u2019s no surprise that many operas have dull moments. Baseball games sure do! But Rigoletto has crossed the centuries well: it\u2019s quick and dirty in the best sense of both words (especially when the performance team is on point). It\u2019s a great choice for a new opera-goer, as are Salome, The Flying Dutchman, Peter Grimes, and The Marriage of Figaro. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It\u2019s gorgeous, it\u2019s relatively short, and Verdi\u2019s one of my personal favorite operatic composers. The only reason I\u2019d say not to start with Verdi is because of how hard it will be for any other composer to live up to him! But yes. There\u2019s no reason not to start big and awesome. To be honest, I\u2019ve never actually sat down and watched Rigoletto, so I loaded up this video on Youtube. It\u2019s a fantastic performance. I regret that there are no subtitles or I would recommend going ahead and watching that version right now. This is a fine introductory opera. It\u2019s a good representation of the efforts of the mid-Romantic Era and a good introduction to Italian opera. I think most audiences will find it accessible and enjoyable. If you have a chance to check it out, go for it. Thanks for the a2a Michael Persson. ",
