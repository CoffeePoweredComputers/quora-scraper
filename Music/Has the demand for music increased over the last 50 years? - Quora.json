            "answer_text": "Has the demand for music increased over the last 50 years? I would say not really. If anything, it is about the same. The source of both the supply and demand are different, but the need for music is probably about the same. Until the advent of recordings, people entertained each other, and the primary source of entertainment was making music. When movies, television, videos, and video games came along, music was used either as the main event, as in a musical, or to fill in the background. Notice that the availability of record players for the masses came out around the time of silent movies. The advents of tapes and television weren\u2019t that far apart. Videos for homes appeared around the same time as CDs. And DVDs and .mp3 players showed up about the same time, as well. Video games sparked the production of accompanying music that rivals some composed art music. Home music production occurred shortly after YouTube surfaced. For every invention that took peoples\u2019 attention away from music, the music industry had some kind of answer. The sources of music changed to match each new distraction. The demand for music hasn\u2019t really increased, but it certainly hasn\u2019t increased, either. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. What I am seeing however, is a bigger demand for music with Western roots and influences, especially American genres like jazz, pop, hip-hop, rock, and R\u2019n\u2019B. I can imagine this to be rooted in a desire to break away from long cherished traditions and having them redefined for modern living. At the same time, new technologies and improvements in social relations has caused many styles of traditional folk, ethnic folk, and classical music to gain popularity again with a revamped sound and approach. Otherwise, I believe that the demand for music has remained practically the same although new technologies and research is seeing applications in other fields and areas, especially in therapy. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the demand for music is rising due to the many variations of existing styles. Blues has been adopted by young players who are adding to the traditions. Existing blues players are wailing away at every opportunity. The different takes on Hip Hop and Latin styles have been adding new sounds and rhythms that expand the inventory of the music world. I have my own favorites also. A big lift for me was the return of vinyl records and turntables. I can now play my ancient Jimi Hendrix albums in their rightful context (digital has a knack for sanitizing the original sound). ",

Music in every store anymore. Play a video game. Constant music. I think the demand for music is greater, but not in the way some might consider at first. ",
