            "answer_text": "This NOT true on all drum brake systems,the reverse activation that is. Admittedly it's often hard to tell at glance,it will usually depend on the location of the Wheel Cylinder. If the starwheel is located just under the wheel cylinder, the auto adjustment is done by the parking brake. This closer to the top of the backing plate. But this system is often \u201cDual Servo\u201d as it is often called. This relies on the movement of both pistons of the Wheel cylinder. Where other systems rely on one piston moving the PRIMARY Shoe ,the other piston is rather anchored by the Secondary Shoe . This make the shoes kind of \u201cWrap\u201d in the direction of rotation. But the Secondary Shoe had less lining and the design creates some slack in reverse and this movement drives the mechanism to rotate the starwheel adjuster mechanism during this moment while the shoes move within this slack . This takes place at slow speeds going backwards,so this momentary slack in the system is nearly unnoticeable. If the starwheel is located at the base of the brakes and acts as the hinge point for the shoes, then the adjustment is done by backing up. Although the parking brake usually activates this action as well. Japanese cars mostly all adjust by the parking brake as do many newer American models. But drum brakes have become a relative rarity in the recent decades. Often the only Drum Brake now,is the Parking brake drum,which is the internal surface of the Disc brakes mounting hub. You'd have to see the internals or just the service manual drawings to see the particular design. Then again\u2026.if we are really going back to BAD OLD DAYS of ALL DRUM BRAKE cars\u2026\u2026you HOPED they were SELF Adjusting ! :^D But MOST of those cars were relatively SIMPLE to adjust the slack out of the shoes , at least.

            "answer_text": "On some older cars, mostly GM but the system was on many different cars and trucks. the drum brakes in the rear only had self adjusters. Essentially they work by the fact that when the brake shoes are applied to the drum they tend to try and turn in the direction of rotation. That\u2019s how they work. So, in the rear there is a small steel cable that attaches to a lever. When the brakes are applied while moving in reverse the brake shoe shifts a small distance applies tension to the cable which moves the lever which in contact with the adjusting mechanism, thus tightening the brake adjuster. It was designed to work only in reverse since most drivers back in and out of parking spaces slowly making it easier for the automatic adjusters to work. ",
