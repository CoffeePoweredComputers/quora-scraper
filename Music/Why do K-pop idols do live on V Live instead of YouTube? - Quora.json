The app was purposefully made for the live streams for Korean celebrities including Kpop idols. It will also be easy for idols who are not fluent in English. Sometimes YouTube crashes in a live stream if the increasing no. of watchers can't be handled. V live brought kpop to our hands and many stick with it. It avoids YouTube's cons. ",
