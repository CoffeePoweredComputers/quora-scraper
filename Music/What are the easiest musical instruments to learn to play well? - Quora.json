            "answer_text": "Keyboard is one of the easiest. Unlike stringed instruments, woodwinds, and brass, it doesn\u2019t require years of learning specific techniques to produce an acceptable sound. Other tuned percussion instruments tend to have that in common. Xylophone/marimba, glockenspiel, bells, chimes, don\u2019t require the kind of technique that, say, violin or sax or oboe do. I know nest to nothing about untuned percussion, so am not going to mention it. This is not to say that there is no technique, or that technique will not make a difference in the final quality of your playing. But the technique you have to learn to just get a clear, loud tone out of a violin takes much longer to learn, and even longer to master; you can press a key on a piano or strike a tuned bar with a mallet, and get a clear tone immediately. At RenFaires, the instrument we tend to head new cast members to is the pennywhistle, for a number of reasons They are period-appropriate.They are inexpensive.It takes very little technique to learn to play a simple melody.The quality of the tone carried better over a short distance in a very acoustically-deficient venue like outdoors with lots of competing noise than most small, inexpensive, easily learned instruments. Recorder is on example.Drawbacks: Pennywhistles play in specific keys. The D whistle plays well in D and G major. The C (=to B-flat concert tuning) whistle plays well in C and F major.Minor keys can be a little challenging, either through fingering or by covering half the hole to change the pitch of a note. Pain in the butt, unless you are playing in A minor\u2014which, like C major, has no sharps or flats-on a C whistle. Still requires some interesting fingering.The band I direct at my local RenFaire consists of at least the following (it varies from performance to performance): ladder xylophonepennywhistlesoprano recorderviolindrumThe xylo player had never played a tuned instrument when I handed it to him and said \u201cHere. Learn to play these six songs by opening,\u201d handed him the instrument and the sheet music with the note names written in. The xylo bars had the note stamped in each bar. He did, and still plays with us every show; he has become quite skilled for our purposes. The recorder player was a find; she studied clarinet for years. We lucked out! But I have been in other iterations of this band where the recorder player(s) wree self-taught to begin with. The pennywhistle player had some small experience; she has become rock-solid in very little time. The drummer is not formally trained, but has a metronome in his head. YaY! The violinist had two or three years of lessons before she could actually get a good enough sound to play in public. This is not even a little bit unusual. I have taken keyboard, guitar, recorder, and violin. Of the four, keyboard was far and away the easiest, then recorder, then guitar, and violin s*cks. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was 17, my mother gave me a guitar for my birthday (being a teenager in the late eighties, I wanted to play the Saxophone, but my father deemed it too expensive and got me the family old cuatro) I hated that thing because my 12-year-old boy dream was to rock the sax like Bill Clinton did once and to play Franco de Vita\u2019s songs. So this was the complete opposite of that. A Cuatro is a four-string instrument (hence the name cuatro, it means four in spanish). It\u2019s sort of like an Ukelele but the sound is quite different, it is used to play mostly venezuelan folk music.  I was going to look as cool as that dude playing the \u201ccuatro\u201d - Wikipedia Back to the guitar I was in love! Those days Oasis, Smashing Pumkins and Pearl Jam were rocking and I was rocking to their songs, but getting started on the guitar was really hard for me (it was an acoustic spanish guitar, but I rocked nonetheless). The coordination was difficult, my fingers hurt and I was getting frustrated. One day I saw the \u201ccuatro\u201d laying around and decided it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try it, I never did take lessons because I hated the thing, but it came with a booklet, so I started reading and in a couple days I was playing gaitas. The most surprising thing was when I got to the guitar again and suddenly I was getting better at it, maybe it was a thing of being intimidated by the two extra strings and the size of it, and the fact that so many great guitarrists blew my mind from Jimmy Hendrics to Slash and such. I\u2019d say the easiest instrument is the one you fear less and love more, I never took lessons and perhaps I should, but I can carry a tune and enjoy my guitar and my cuatro and they follow me wherever I go. Below an example of well-played cuatro:  Play till your fingers bleed! ",
