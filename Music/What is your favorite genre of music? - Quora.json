            "answer_text": "What is your favorite genre of music? **I love all kinds of the music, but for the purpose of this answer, I\u2019m going to pretend that there is only one radio station I can choose and go with that for my answer** The kind of music that I can say I could listen to indefinitely would be the power ballad of the 70\u2019s/80\u2019s. One of the things that makes that time period special to me are my memories of the time and hearing these songs transports me back to my teenage years. It was a pretty awesome time and here is what I love so much about it: The lyrics from that era were brilliant. Stories that resonate in your soul and you can\u2019t help but sing along (think \u201cDreamweaver\u201d \u201cWildfire\u201d \u201cSultans of Swing\u201d \u201cStairway to heaven\u201d \u201cHotel California\u201d).The singers had voices that were distinct and not messed with by autotune or any other tricks in the studio. Bands like The Eagles, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Queen\u2026 they used their voices as another instrument in the band and they had harmony nailed down tight.The album was more than just a a musical experience. You got the album cover that had great photos. lyrics or stories and even the album sleeve sometimes had photos also. The double album was a special treat to have.The album had to be played on a record player, and it wasn\u2019t just one good song, it was 11 or 12 good songs. You could just start the record and play it all the way through (and record players had the great \u201crepeat\u201d switch that would make it start over as soon as it finished.In those days, you couldn\u2019t just hear a song whenever you wanted like you can now or buy any song you wanted at any time, you had to wait for it to play on the radio or buy the record, no other options. The record store might be out of the album you wanted, and you would have to wait for it. That\u2019s what made getting the record of your favorite band so precious. Your friends would be jealous if you got one that they couldn\u2019t find.45 singles were cheap (that was all I could afford most of the time) and you got 2 songs, because you got a hit song and then the B side.The melodies were deep and haunting and set the mood for the song. I think that is why music from the 70\u2019s is used so much in movies when they want to inspire a \u201cfeeling\u201d. (I remember how I felt when I watched \u201cSeeking a friend for the end of the world\u201d and there is a scene where the character is saying goodbye to the love of his life and the music playing is the Hollies, \u201cThe air that I breathe\u201d. It was perfect).The individuality of every group was also unique to that time period. You could hear the opening guitar rifts and without a single vocal, you knew immediately that it was Led Zeppelin or Queen. They all had their own sound and their fan base knew and loved every single sound from each song.The number one thing is the music. The instrumental lead in\u2019s, the solos in the middle of the song, the dramatic finish. Sometimes they may have 6\u20137 instruments that play their own solo and then they blend together for seamless harmony. Song\u2019s today do not have the composition complexity, mostly it is just repeating sounds and synthesized vocals.I give you this example. Close your eyes and listen to this song. Admittedly Al Stewart is not the best vocalist that ever lived, but this song embodies everything awesome about that time period. Listen for the different guitar solos, the saxophone, the violins, the various percussion instruments, the keyboards and the transitions from one solo to another. It is like a complicated dance is happening in your ears and you are just being carried along by the music. The groups of the 70s/80s really had it going on.  source: Youtube ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a very ecletic person when it comes to music, though I do have a favorite genre that flows in my mind: Progressive Rock. Ever since I was little I was introduced to the classic rock scene, from the 70s to the mid 90s, by my dad. He loved (and still does) all kinds of rock bands, from the likes of Scorpions, The Who, Iron Maiden, Green Day, Nirvana, and on and on and on. I liked listening to music from time to time, but it wasn\u2019t until when I was 14 that a spark lit inside me and made music a very core part of who I am. I was at a cousin\u2019s house playing Guitar Hero II, which I didn\u2019t have yet, and as we were browsing the songs, I saw one with a funny name, \u201cYYZ\u201d. I asked him to have us play that, and as we were playing I was blown away by it. I first found it strange that there were no vocals - it was my first time hearing a rock instrumental song - and by the end of the song I had realized that there really was no need for words. Then I wanted to hear more songs by that band, to know what they played and see if they had anything cool. This was 9 years ago, and the story of how I was introduced to the Canadian group Rush. To this day they are still my favorite band in the whole world, for having gotten to know their work opened many, many doors in music to me. It was with them that I learned to like listening to discographies of bands for hours on end, doing nothing else but enjoying the music, the lyrics, the elements and the feelings - and prog rock bands excel in doing this. They have the ability of setting many different moods, to not be constrained by the standard rock instruments (guitars, bass and drums - with the occasional keyboard), and this taught me a lot musically. There was also the lyrics aspect, and my writing abilities were greatly boosted by this. After I was done with listening to pretty much everything they had, I wanted more, and there was a world beyond that to explore. Then I got to know a lot of bands over the years, most of them unheard of, of the likes of Magic Pie, Transatlantic, Ayreon, Dream Theater (maybe one of the most known names on this list), The Flower Kings, Echolyn, Haken, Spock\u2019s Beard, Soul Secret, DeeExpus Project, Porcupine Tree, Jethro Tull, ELP (Both Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Emerson, Lake & Powell), Avantasia, Comedy of Errors, Big Big Train and the list goes on. And these are just some bands of this particular genre, I could mention about a thousand bands of all genres I know and like. ",
