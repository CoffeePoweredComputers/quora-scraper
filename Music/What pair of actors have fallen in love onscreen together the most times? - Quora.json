            "answer_text": " Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan actually appear in three different movies as love interests; 1990's Joe Versus the Volcano and 1998's You've Got Mail bookend their onscreen love affair (Sleepless in Seattle is the third). We'd be happy to see them reunited for one more movie, because each of their love stories charms us every single time we watch.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet The fact that star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose are separated by death in Titanic is one of film's big tragedies, and it seemed right that DiCaprio and Winslet got a second chance to be together 11 years later in Revolutionary Road \u2014 until we saw how depressing Revolutionary Road is. Can't these two just have a happy ending?!  Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan This real-life married couple met on the set of 2006's Step Up, but their onscreen collaborations didn't stop there. After they got married, they played boyfriend and girlfriend in 2012's reunion drama 10 Years. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson  these bubbly actors seem like they have so much fun together on screen, first in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, then in Fool's Gold, which followed five years later. Maybe it's the fact that their characters are always a little bit contentious . . . but ultimately want to make out.  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts In 1990's Pretty Woman, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts' character from a life of prostitution, and then, he had to save her again in Runaway Bride nine years later \u2014 from her commitment issues.  Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal Their love story isn't so sweet in Brokeback Mountain \u2014 he's gay, after all, and in love with someone else. But in Love and Other Drugs, Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal have a much more romantic love story (and better hair).  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling These two showed surprisingly strong chemistry in the 2010 romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love, so we were excited to see them reteam as love interests again in the far grittier Gangster Squad last year and LA LA Land in 2016. And we're still extremely jealous of Emma Stone.  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence We first questioned the pairing of Lawrence and Cooper as love interests in Silver Linings Playbook, mainly due to their 16-year age difference, but their chemistry in the film blew us away. We're looking forward to seeing more of it on display when they play a married couple in upcoming Depression-era drama Serena. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know if this pair has the record, but Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were cast as love interests in nine movies, from 1942 until 1967. Woman of the Year (1942) Keeper of the Flame (1942) Without Love (1945) The Sea of Grass (1947) State of the Union (1948) Adam's Rib (1949) Pat and Mike (1952) Desk Set (1957) Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) After meeting on the set of the Academy Award-winning film Woman of the Year, they began a romantic relationship, even though Spencer Tracy was married. Although Tracy never divorced his wife, Tracy and Hepburn\u2019s relationship continued until Spencer Tracy\u2019s death in 1967, which happened 17 days after completing filming on their last film, the Academy Award-winning Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner. Katharine Hepburn Hepburn had a 26-year relationship with actor Spencer Tracy, although he never divorced his wife. The most significant relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, \"It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I would have done anything for him.\"[262] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how \"blindingly\" in love Hepburn was with the actor.[263] The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs.[217][235][264] Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian,[265] but Hepburn said she \"knew right away that I found him irresistible.\"[266] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce.[267] Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.[268] With Tracy determined to conceal the relationship with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private.[269] They were careful not to be seen in public together, and maintained separate residences.[264][270] Tracy was an alcoholic and was frequently depressed; Hepburn described him as \"tortured\",[271] and she devoted herself to making his life easier.[272] Reports from people who saw them together describe how Hepburn's entire demeanor changed when around Tracy.[273] She mothered and obeyed him, and Tracy became heavily dependent on her.[274] They often spent stretches of time apart due to their work, particularly in the 1950s when Hepburn was largely abroad for career commitments.[275] Tracy's health declined significantly in the 1960s, and Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him.[176] She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967.[276] Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral.[277] It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star.[278] In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, \"I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could never have left him.\"[176] She claimed to not know how he felt about her[279] and that they \"just passed twenty-seven years [sic] together in what was to me absolute bliss.\"[279] ",
