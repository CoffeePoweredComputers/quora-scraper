            "answer_text": "The song is about his wife Hailey Baldwin. Starting with the chorus: Yeah, you got that yummy-yumThat yummy-yum, that yummy-yummyYeah, you got that yummy-yumThat yummy-yum, that yummy-yummySay\u2005the\u2005word, on my\u2005wayYeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babeAny\u2005night, any daySay the word, on my wayYeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babeIn the mornin\u2019 or the lateSay the word, on my way Right off the bat, we know Justin\u2019s talking about either a 24-hour drive-through he can hit up at all hours of the day OR, more logically, his wife. Then he gets into a popular metaphor: Bona fide stallionAin\u2019t in no stable, no, you stay on the runAin\u2019t on the side, you\u2019re number oneYeah, every time I come around, you get it done (you get it done) It seems that Justin\u2019s comparing 5'7\" Hailey to a stallion here. If you\u2019re not obsessed with Megan Thee Stallion or from the South, you might not know that stallion is slang for a \u201ctall, fine girl,\u201d according to Meg herself. So to Justin, Hailey = bona fide stallion. And the \u201cain\u2019t on the side, you\u2019re number one\u201d line sounds like he\u2019s reassuring Hailey that she\u2019s the only woman in his life. Love to hear it. Sorry, Jelena fans, but we\u2019re moving on! He gives a little insight into their finances and love life: Fifty-fifty, love the way you split itHundred racks, help me spend it, babeLight a match, get litty, babeThat jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeahRollin\u2019 eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah Let\u2019s get the obvious bit out of the way: The eyes rolling back and toes curling part is definitely about sex. Justin and Hailey were incredibly candid about their love life in a February Vogue interview, in which he said they remained celibate while they dated and God \u201cblessed\u201d him with Hailey because of his \u201cgood behavior.\u201d But they are married and don\u2019t have to think about abstaining anymore, so now we get to hear a bit about their personal life in this song. As for the \u201cfifty-fifty, love the way you split it,\u201d Justin\u2019s probably talking about how Hailey has her own career and money but also helps him spend his \u201chundred racks.\u201d Guess that\u2019s important to him!

Yeah according to that article Justin faced sexual assault by older celebrities when he was younger like 15 16. One of the those celebrities also said that Justin had the beauty of a woman so you can clearly understand what he meant. As Justin was young and emerging child star he needed support from people and also he was just helpless and let things happen. He couldn\u2019t talk against those people as it could put his career in stake. There were a lot of proofs that this songs about child abuse including the music video of yummy. ",
