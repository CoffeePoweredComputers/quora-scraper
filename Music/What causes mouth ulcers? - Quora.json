            "answer_text": "Oral ulceration is one of the commonest diseases of the mucosa, but this should not make the patient take it lightly. Sometimes oral ulceration can be a very serious condition.  There are many reasons for oral ulcerations: 1. Trauma: and this could be due to mechanical forces (such as trauma caused when you accidentally bite your cheeks, or when you scratch your mucosa with some hard foods), thermal (when you eat or drink something very hot), and chemical (for instance when chewing aspirin, or when accidentally dangerous acids are drunk mistakenly as water). 2. Diseases: the list is huge; some of the diseases are of bacterial, viral or fungal cause, while others are simply idiopathic. The most common ones are:  (Pediatric Aphthous Ulcers - Medscape) Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS): very common, affects 5-66% of the population. The etiology of RAS is not entirely clear. There seems to be some genetic basis for RAS. It can also be a manifestation of a group of disorders. Herpes simplex virus: the most common cause is HSV-1, however HSV-2 could also have oral manifestations.Herpes zoster.Herpangina (very common in children).HIV infection.3. Autoimmune conditions such as Beh\u00e7et syndrome, Lichen planus and others. 4. Irradiation and chemotherapy. 5. Neoplastic conditions: squamous cell carcinoma (SSC), is by far the most common (accounts for about 90% of all oral cancers). 6. Medications and drugs: in addition to the previously mentioned chemotherapeutic agents, non steroid anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are very common cause. Cocaine causes oral ulcers when in contact with the mucosa. There are many other causes, but I believe these are the ones we see on daily basis. ",
