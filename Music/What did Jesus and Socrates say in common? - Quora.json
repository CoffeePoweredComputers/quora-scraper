            "answer_text": "They do not usually tend to say the same things, because the Platonic Socrates seems to be interested mainly in the position of philosophers and intellectuals, and what they can do for the rest of society; while the New Testament Jesus has a sympathy that in no way is limited to the intelligentsia. He\u2019s more interested in the downtrodden and poor. Nonetheless, there are some areas of agreement. One of the most famous sayings of Socrates \u2014 and another by Jesus \u2014 are very similar in outlook. SOCRATES: No one sins unknowingly. JESUS: Forgive them Father, they know not what they do. In other words, but of them express the idea (at least in these quotes) that everyone who does evil does so primarily out of ignorance and therefore is potentially redeemable. ",
