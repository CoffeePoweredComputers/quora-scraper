            "answer_text": "A part of me is excited for her to be getting such a big role, but I'm nervous that she might not live up to the hype of the role she'll be playing. If she doesn't exceed knetizens expectations, she\u2019ll be shredded by them. Int. fans and blackpink antis as well. I can already hear it. \u201cShe's just a visual\u201d or \u201cbeautiful face but horrible actress\u201d I don't stan blackpink but I'm rooting for her with this cause I've been wanting to see her in a lead role for SO LONG. I haven't seen any of her minor roles so this will be my first drama with her. She has experience, but experience doesnt always equal good actor. You're either born with a talent or you learn a skill. Idk how good she is but I really hope she does well. I'll watch anyway cause the writer of Snowdrop wrote Sky Castle and that's one of my favorite kdramas. ",
