            "answer_text": "Like any skill, there are various levels of proficiency one can achieve as a DJ. Here, I list these different types and what they do: The Party Dj:  This guy owns his own sound system and DJ equipment, it is usually of medium quality, and uses a laptop with DJ software. This type of DJ can be hired to play at private events where a predetermined setlist or genre of music is to be played. This DJ has enough expertise to skillfully mix a few songs in and out of each other, and do some cool transitions, but most of the time it just involves playing one song, and then hitting play on the next one when the time comes. Sometimes lights are involved to add spice. The Club/Festival DJ:  This is a DJ that plays their own selection of music for others in a festival or club setting. Given the liberty to choose any song, this DJ needs to be able to read the crowd to strategically play the right song at the right time to keep everybody dancing. This requires keen observation skills, as well as some higher levels of talent when it comes to mixing songs together and doing mashups. Equipment used is almost exclusively pro-quality CDJs. These DJs also produce a lot of the music they play, which is an entirely different career on top of being a DJ. The Vinyl DJ:  This DJ uses two or more vinyl decks hooked up to a mixer to play and mix songs recorded on vinyl. This is arguably the most difficult (and respected) form of DJ-ing, because it does not involve any help from a computer, and therefore requires incredible skill to become proficient. The DJ needs to be able to synchronize tempos, find cue points, and transition seamlessly all by moving the deck around manually. Vinyl DJs also know how to scratch decks rhythmically to the beat of a song to add more to the performance. This is more of a performance art in this day and age. The Backing Track DJ:  This DJ can be any one of the above mentioned DJs, but is used to play pre-recorded backing tracks for a live performance group. Rap performers typically have a DJ on stage who plays all of the beats that the rapper will perform to. The only reason I can think of for a rock band to have a DJ is if there are some parts of the songs that would be too logistically complicated to have performed live (orchestral parts, background effects etc). I can think of many metal songs that have a lot of background foley that would be impossible to play live onstage, so a DJ could be put in place to play that part when the time comes. ",

            "answer_text": "A DJ spends most of their time preparing for their set, just like a teacher spends most of their time preparing for class. Most DJs these days add value by choosing the best songs for the event, to suit the crowd but also to push the tastes of the crowd by playing both something familiar and something fresh and new. The DJ has to know their crowd as much as they have to know their record selection. A DJ has to devote a lot of time acquiring music and keeping up to date with the latest, this is more time consuming than you might think and the DJ truly has to love music more than anything else to master the craft. Probably the most important skill and value-add for a DJ involves being able to smoothly move from one song to the next; this involves techniques such as beat-matching and harmonic-mixing. The intricacies of these techniques are best examined by watching a video on YouTube. Another DJ technique is to \u201cextend the breaks\u201d, where a certain portion of a song, which is perhaps underrated, is extended by the DJ via looping (traditionally using two different copies of the same record, one on each turntable). Often times this is an instrumental section which is extended, and the DJ will support a rapper or MC on a mic. This is a lot of what hip hop was about in the beginning and still is to this day - a DJ supporting an MC or rapper. The job of the DJ is to bring the beats while the MC brings the rhymes. Mashing up songs, remixing some songs (acting as a producer and/or then playing your own stuff as a DJ) is also something DJs do - in this way DJs act as more as musician and producer, not purely DJing. Lastly, they have to be somewhat comfortable being an MC and saying a few words to the crowd. But as Rakim says: Don't Sweat the Technique\u2026just get out there and do it. ",
