            "answer_text": "Music that comes from the soul and takes risks. I'm not interested in music that feels like it's been manufactured, thought about long and hard and processed within an inch of its life.  My preference is live music performed by talented musicians who aren't just trying to replicate what they hear on a record. I love the sounds of people pushing each other to new musical destinations and jamming together in ways that expand the boundaries of where they were all prepared to go. Great improvisers are great listeners and hearing people feed off each other in a live setting is especially thrilling. It doesn't matter to me whether it's great rock, blues, jazz, folk funk or whatever as long as there's an element of risk and improvisation involved I'm interested.  My most loved music therefore comes in the form of live recordings by The Grateful Dead. Every time they stepped onto a stage they had no plan of what they were going to do for the night other than play music and listen to each other. That was the extent of their planning. No setlist was the same and songs could move in any direction that band thought they would lead. They could play 90 minutes of continuous music in which songs would evolve into each other and then back again as they were inspired. It didn't always work. Every Deadhead knows that they had off nights but when they were on they were incredible. I can listen to a good recording of a live Dead show in the same way that I watch a move. It's engrossing and demands my full attention. Hearing the band push each other, respond to each other and try out new things is real entertainment and I can go for weeks listening to nothing else. Live recordings by Frank Zappa, Miles Davis, The Allman brothers and bands like them can all have the same impact thanks to their risk taking attitude. I also love live shows by bands like Midnight Oil, the Indigo Girls and Bob Dylan who all take the same attitude into their performances. They might not jam as extensively but they're prepared to push boundaries.  There are exceptions to this rule of course. I love the Beatles and enjoy all their albums even though some of them were very carefully produced and arranged. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, it\u2019s an interesting question and I will be glad after giving this answer. Yes, actually I\u2019m very interested in music. I love to listen to music and whenever I get free time, I just play my playlist music and start listening to music. Since childhood, I have been listening to music because I love music since childhood and it has become my habit now. When I was a child, I just decided that I would be a musician but when I grew up, I got the reality that becoming a musician is not that easy. But still, I didn\u2019t leave listening to music. I feel so proud when I see someone playing music. Now let\u2019s come to the point, the important point that which kind of music I hear and why. I always listen to motivational and revolution music because this music has means of their lyrics. And the whole music depends on the lyrics. If your lyrics don\u2019t have the quality it means these lyrics are meaningless. As far as I think, the music should have the elements, which can aware the world about one issue. Yes, so that the world can be beautiful. These days music is played, but which kind of music, only meaningless. Although there is some good music available too most of the people like to hear the only boom and bold music, they don\u2019t think that this music can affect their mindset, especially youth. We must hear soft, smooth and meaningful music so that we can be aware and make aware to the public too. When you hear motivational music, you go deep in that and get the point that what is being said in the song. Lyrics play an important role in the music so we must listen only motivational and revolution music to be successful in our life. This new generation like rap music but we can openly see a negative change in our youth nature. At last I would like to say only one thing that if you like music, listen motivated songs and bring a nice change in your life because if you are addicted to hearing the music, it is good but this music can increase your lifestyle and this music can decrease your lifestyle so just listen to good music. Keep your loved ones happy and be happy in your beautiful life. ",

            "answer_text": "I enjoy listening to soulful, mainstream music. Music, like writing, is an expression of my feelings that reside deep within me. I express my feelings through words, and for me, music is form that is more raw, more sensational. For me, whatever I listen to has to resonate with me. I don\u2019t listen to Classical music, because although I can appreciate the technical difficulty of the flowing notes and hurrying fingers, it doesn\u2019t call to me like other songs might. Here\u2019s the thing about me: I can be perfectly content to listen to a song for months at a time until I\u2019ve worn it out, like one wears their favourite nightshirt. A couple of songs I like are: Demons- IMAGINE DRAGONS (the first song I listened to with my boyfriend)Jet Black Heart- 5 SECONDS OF SUMMER (for when my surroundings dull to grey, and I need something to express the beat of grief through my cold heart)State of Grace- TAYLOR SWIFT (regardless of your personal beef with her, this song is pretty applicable to love, something I\u2019m fortunate enough to experience. And yeah, I am a swiftie.)Evermore- ALAN MENKEN, Beauty and the Beast (I\u2019m not going to lie. This movie made me cry. It reminded me of my childhood, and the vocals really brought it to life.)Made in the USA- DEMI LOVATO (a feel good song, for the sticky nights when I\u2019m adrenaline filled and I feel like screaming.)You can probably tell I\u2019m a Romantic person at heart- all doe eyed and easily swooning at the promise of kisses. When I\u2019m writing, though, Musical Soundtracks are my go-to. I just discovered the soundtrack from Wicked and Hamilton, and do they make me excited. Wicked is the cotton candy on a child\u2019s hand. Hamilton is thick gooey caramel with swirls of chocolate. I\u2019ll leave you with two quotes from each of these beautiful works of art. Wicked: \u201cLike a comet pulled from orbit, As it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder, Halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But because I knew you, I have been changed for good For Good, Wicked. Hamilton: \u201cIf you stand for nothing, Burr, what\u2019ll you fall for?\u201d - Aaron Burr, Sir This was a long answer. Remind me again why people want to know about my music taste? I\u2019m no virtuoso, like Shane Chew, or Stella Chen. ",

            "answer_text": "I am listening to music accross styles and centuries. So it depends on what I want to achieve with music. Music always touch emotions and life moments are about emotions. When I work you and want a music that pumps me up, or helps me get further beyond my limits while cycling, running, skiing etc. then I listened for example to the soundtrack such as Over the Top or Donna SummersWhen I am at the airport on business trips (which I am often) I try to relax , then I listen to Dire Straits, Mozart Piano Concerts, Barclay James Harvest, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Andean Folk Music, Chris de Burgh, Richard Clayderman or etc.Mentally, I like to travel back in time and realise how fortunate I have been over the years and I am grateful to many people who helped and accompanied me on this life journey. So, I recall memories with my parents during ski vacation, where my dad liked to go to these elegant night clubs, where they play Frank Sinatra and we could go with him (when I moved as young adult to New York, I took one of my dates to the Rainbow atop Rockefeller center\u2026). I enjoy listening to music of my teenage and young adult years, and recall memories of summer schools, parties, or moments when I took a girl for a date or moments with my brother and my sisters (Beatles, Rolling Stones (the first rock concert I was allowed to attend; the very early Rolling Stones (Metamorphoses) are fabulous, too!), Abba, Bryan Adams, Genesis, Eros Ramazzotti, Tears for Fears, Talk Talk, Billy Idol, Ofra Haza etc.I also listen to Operas and Bach\u2019s Magnificat and H\u00e4ndel\u2019s Messiah, as I sang in a choir. However, Operas I need to pay specific attention to follow the story.When I prepare for an important business meeting I might pump myself up with hard rock (Uriah Heep, Scorpions, Krokus). My wife does not like that style of music, but I guess she never tried to understand this music style. Some of the guitar solos are as virtuous as in a Paganini Violin Piece.Then there are moments when I read a book and listen to Rachmaninov plays Rachmaninov, the whole Mozart Piano Concerts, or Helen Grimaud playing Beethoven\u2019s 5th Piano Concert, David Oistrach or Yehudi Menuhin playing Bach violin concerts is from another planet. I like Sol Gabetta playing Haydn, Hofmann and Mozart on her cello, she is talented as well as Misha Maisky performing Dvorak Cello Concert B Minor.I also I listen to Bach (Violin Sonatas and Concerts), Beethoven (Romances 1&2) and Mozart Violin Concerts as well as trios when I practice my violin and it helps me to practice without teacher.When we travel as a family by car we listen often to Latin Music such as Luis Guerra, Guilherme Arantes, Marisa Montes or Michel Sardou.Finally, I have been living 15 of the last 20 years outside the country I grew up. So, there are moments I listen to Swiss Folk songs, B\u00e4rner Troubadours (Mani Matter), Swiss Rock (Gol\u00e4) or Swiss Army Brass Bands (I served 3 years in the army). My kids tease my and say I am homesick, which I am not (I would not spend 75% of my adult life outside my home country if I did not like and enjoy it), however it gives me nice flash backs and reminds me from where I grew up, which is nice and can be well done with music.Most of the classical music I listened to is performed by artist I was privilege to hear live: i.e. Helen Grimaud, Yehudi Menuhin, Misha Maisky, Herbert von Karajan, Julia Fischer, Ann-Sophie Mutter etc.. the same is for contemporarian music: The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, Eros Ramazzotti etc.So, the music I listen to is very much linked to my life events and emotions and I select the music specifically to enhance and accompany those emotions. Seldom I just listen to music in order to have a background noise what is played by a radio station or speaker at home. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I like all kinds of stuff. Heavy metal enthuses me just as much as a soft pop song. I can listen to rap as long it\u2019s not the complete trash that Lil Pump or The Paul Brothers put out. However, the prevailing genre is rock in general. I like the old stuff like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Guns and Roses, Johnny Cash, and more. I also like some of the modern and new rock that\u2019s been emerging lately. People talk about how all of today\u2019s rock is trash, and how it\u2019s just sound, (namely me with some bands) but there are so many great artists that are just undiscovered. I\u2019ll name some of my favorites, maybe you\u2019ve heard of them, maybe you haven\u2019t. Royal BloodCheck out some of their B-Sides, it\u2019s the heavy rock that I love! I also like their self-titled album.BadflowerNot really well known, but they\u2019re kind of heavy too. Some songs are really relaxing but others are nice to rock out to.Catfish and the BottlemenHonestly, the really new stuff is pretty boring, because they have a new image that appeals to fangirls. Their old stuff is good, though.Another genre I\u2019m starting to get into is indie or indie rock. Declan McKennaIt\u2019s definitely more poppy and upbeat, but it\u2019s nice to listen to. His music also has messages instead of being aimless. I can\u2019t name one song that I don\u2019t like by him after listening to his discography several times.Peach PitIt\u2019s not music that you dance to in the club (like I\u2019ve even been to one), but it\u2019s fun to dance to. It\u2019s an enjoyable kind of pop, not an annoying one. Some songs have rock in them too.Rex Orange CountyI guess I don\u2019t know how to categorize Rex, so I just popped him in here. His music, while having an R&B feel that I don\u2019t usually like has an exception for me. For such a young artist, he has so much talent.Mac DeMarcoMac is the epitome of the indie rock scene, and probably the biggest name in the industry. His music is calm and relaxing, the kind that I can do homework to but also listen to for fun.boy pabloThey\u2019re relatively new, but I love them. Pablo is a beautiful boy, but his music is also very relaxing.I also have a lot of oldies, like Frank Sinatra, Peggy March, The Chordettes, Billy Idol, Wham!, Radiohead (I guess it\u2019s old? idk), Nat King Cole, and Ella Fitzgerald. Their voices are just so smooth and easy to listen to. ",

            "answer_text": "I love classical music because it has such depth and passion and great beauty. In the case of Bach, there is mathematical precision as well. Look at the music of Mozart. Piano concerto #1 has lyrical beauty, and it was used in the movie Elvira Madigan. Much of The Magic Flute is rollicking fun, especially Papageno\u2019s arias, but there is magnificence in O Isis and Osiris, and the Queen of the Night\u2019s aria is one of the great coloratura arias. Don Giovanni has its light moments, but it ends on a note of terror. There are gorgeous lyrical arias in Puccini\u2019s operas, like O Mio Babbino Caro from Gianni Schicchi and Nessun Dorma from Turandot, and Caro Nome from Verdi\u2019s Rigoletto is a perfect depiction of an innocent young girl in love. Great works for small groups exist\u2014the Trio from Faust, Quartet from Rigoletto, and Sextet from Lucia di Lammermoor. The Anvil Chorus from Il Trovatore is unforgettable and fits into the storyline perfectly. I could go on and on. Listen to the Rose Adagio from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sleeping Beauty. Listen to the Adagio from Spartacus by Khachaturian. Listen to Beethoven\u2019s Ninth, or his Fifth, or his Third (Eroica), or his Sixth (Pastoral), or his Piano Concerto #5 (Emperor). And, what the heck, listen to Rossini\u2019s William Tell Overture from the beginning, not just the Lone Ranger movement! And, while you\u2019re at it, his Largo al Factotum from The Barber of Seville. Music is joy. Listen to some pieces that cross over from more popular music, like the ragtime tunes of Scott Joplin and Joseph Lamb. The great Broadway composer Richard Rodgers wrote a magnificent suite for the television show Victory at Sea, and George Gershwin wrote Rhapsody in Blue and Concerto in F. Listen to Bizet\u2019s Carmen; there\u2019s much more to it than \u201cToreador, don\u2019t spit on the floor. Use the cuspidor. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for!\u201d Why not watch Fantasia & Fantasia II. You\u2019ll never hear The Sorceror\u2019s Apprentice without thinking of Mickey Mouse! Watch a ballet or an opera. Try it. You just might like it. ",

            "answer_text": "I like all kinds of music. Most of the music I listen to are multiple different genres of rock music including old fashioned rock n roll, hard rock, blues rock, emo, goth, punk, skate punk, pop punk, glam rock, glam metal, heavy metal, grunge, nu-metal, rap rock, psychedelic rock, funk rock, etc. The reason why I love rock music so much is because I grew up listening to different rock artists like Elvis, Queen, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. However, I do love other genres besides rock including various genres of pop music, reggae, EDM and any related genre, soul/R&B, rap (artists and subgenres may vary), alternative R&B (aka emo R&B), a little bit of country, and new jack swing. The reason why I love all of these other genres is because I\u2019ve grown to love and learn about many artists from each of these genres from Kenny Rogers, to Charlie Daniels, to Lionel Richie, to Bob Marley, to Ziggy Marley, to Stephen Marley, to Skip Marley, to Daft Punk, to Usher, to Johnny Kemp, to Terence Trent D\u2019Arby, and many others. Basically, I love multiple kinds of music because music is one of the things I\u2019m passionate about, what I love talking about, and it\u2019s one of the things I can listen and relate to whenever I\u2019m in a certain mood.

I also like to listen to songs which have been remixed to sound like they\u2019re being sung by Alvin and the Chipmunks. The most recent artist I began listening to, would be Beth Crowley.

            "answer_text": "I honestly don't really know genre wise, since a lot of my music seems to cross genres a lot. I just listen to what I like and don't care about labels. However, I definitely lean more towards rock and associated genres. I tolerate most everything, but only some things I like are actually in my playlists that I actively seek out and listen. Three Days Grace, Black Veil Brides and 3 Doors Down (though I don't listen to this band itself as much, it's here because of the sheer volume of songs) are what I would say are my heaviest hitters, with the vast majority of their music found in my playlists. My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, Nickelback, 10 Years, Flyleaf, All Time Low, Sleeping With Sirens, Seether, Evanescence, and Breaking Benjamin are all in there with varying levels from several albums' worth (but not as much in proportion to their total music amount compared to the main three) to about an album and a half worth of songs, and are listened to anywhere from occasionally to almost every time I turn on music. Of Mice And Men, Bring Me The Horizon, Yanni, Trapt, Drowning Pool, Falling In Reverse, Finger Eleven, Styx, Skillet, Green Day, Get Scared, Twenty One Pilots, Gerard Way, and Disney (these being soundtracks from movies) have between two songs to about an album's worth in my playlist, again varying in how much they are played. Staind, Adema, Hinder, Stone Sour, Taylor Swift, Foreigner, Shakira, Ed Sheeran, Shinedown, Katy Perry, Florence + The Machine, and The Struts all have one song each, and aren't all that important in my music repertoire collectively. Which artists are played and what \"type\" of song (sad, upbeat, inspirational, etc) I focus on depends on my mood mostly. Also, as time goes on I tend to drift from older favorites and listen to newer (to me) artists/bands more until a new album is released (if there ever is one), to which I usually obsess over however much of the new music i like for a time. When I start getting tired of my current group of highly played songs I either form a new one, occasionally search for new music by either finding new artists/bands or giving other music from my current lineup another listen to see if my opinion on the song has changed, or just listen to my entire \"master playlist\" for a while. New music gets added every once in a while, and I listen to far more in the car with my dad due to his liking of everything from Pink Floyd to Bruno Mars to Celine Dion to Metallica. That stuff just isn't in my playlist, though some of it will eventually find its way in there. You probably didn't want an in depth look at my listening habits or a list of every band and artist I listen to and the specific amounts from each, but I'm hoping someone will be able to help me out in describing my music preferences in a few words and not a paragraph like I have to now (otherwise I feel like something's been left out because to be completely honest my memory sucks and I had to go looking through my master playlist to even remember half of these artists/bands).

            "answer_text": "I enjoy country music. I\u2019m 37. I grew up in Pearland, Texas which is a suburb of Houston. I was raised in a blue-collar, Hispanic household with 2 older sisters where our parents taught us the value of hard work and that nothing ever comes free in life. My parents listened to two types of music at home: Tejano, which is a blend of Tex-Mex sung in Spanish, and country. I never cared for Tejano. Number one, I was never taught Spanish so I didn\u2019t know what the heck they were singing about. Also, the music - the music all sounded the same to me. The same bass pattern still echos in my mind today as I\u2019m writing this. Some, including me, would say it sounds like circus music. My apologies to anyone reading this that\u2019s a fan of Tejano music. It just wasn\u2019t my style. But country music stuck to me. I can remember the first song I ever liked, \u201c18 wheeler\u201d by the legendary group Alabama. Subsequently, Alabama was the first artist or group that I ever liked as a kid. I remember I would sing the words to my mom. And I really enjoyed the 18-wheeler truck horn at the very end of the track. Sometimes the Houston radio stations would play it all the way to the end where I would hear the horn blowing, sometimes they wouldn\u2019t. I was disappointed when they wouldn\u2019t. I can remember my dad singing to \u201cBop\u201d by Dan Seals both in the shower and in the car. There is something about that saxophone in the intro and throughout the song that captivates me. Then a guy named Randy Travis came onto the scene at some point. \u201cThe Voice\u201d was mesmerizing and I started paying more attention to the lyrics of a song. I couldn\u2019t get enough of songs like \u201cOn the Other Hand\u201d and \u201c1982\u201d. \u201cAmarillo by Morning\u201d by George Strait quickly became one of my personal favorites when it came out. Texans are very prideful people. So when a song about Texas comes out - well, that\u2019s just another selling point of the song to Texans. But that fiddle in the song was like music to my ears, literally. As Alabama would say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a fiddle in the band\u201d. My dad joined a bowling league in the 90\u2019s. This was when Brooks and Dunn was coming on strong. He\u2019d take me with him every Monday. Sometimes my mom would go too. I can remember hearing songs like \u201cBrand New Man\u201d and \u201cBoot Scootin\u2019 Boogie\u201d every time we\u2019d go to the bowling alley. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is one of the biggest events in Texas. Every year the biggest names in country music would come to perform at the Astrodome (now NRG stadium). In addition, cowboys would come to try to hold on to the buckin\u2019 broncs for an 8 second ride. My parents would take me here each year. I saw all the big name acts that I had been hearing on the radio. Brooks and Dunn, Alabama, Clay Walker, and others. These were my first concerts I had ever attended. 90\u2019s country is my personal favorite type of country music. Beaumont, TX was put on the map because of the talent that had come from there to Nashville. Mark Chesnutt, Tracy Byrd, and Clay Walker all came on to the scene and had hit singles during this time. Beaumont is also where George Jones was from. I\u2019m a big Mark Chesnutt fan. There\u2019s no sound sweeter than the steel guitar in \u201cToo Cold at Home\u201d. As I got a little older, I would fall in love, endure breakups, be cheated on, fall in love again, drink too much whiskey, and my beloved childhood dog, Blue, would die. This is a country song, isn\u2019t it? Maybe that\u2019s why I love the music so much; it\u2019s something that I have connected to. But the song doesn\u2019t end there; it\u2019s only the beginning. One day, in 2006, on MySpace, a \u201cfriend\u201d who lived in Georgia at the time and whom I had never spoken a single word to had asked a question on the MySpace \u201cbulletin board\u201d. She said she heard a song that day on the radio. The song was stuck in her head but she didn\u2019t know the name of it. She said it was about dying and it had a jukebox in it. She asked if anyone on MySpace knew what this song was. Naturally, I knew what exactly the song was without even having to look it up. I replied back, \u201cProp Me Up Beside the Jukebox (if I die)\u201d by Joe Diffie.\u201d She replied back \u201cThank You and you\u2019re really great\u201d. We got married in 2008. Today, she is my wife and the mother of our 2 kids. The other day we were all driving to church with our kids in the backseat. I turned on the radio, or Pandora, and \u201cKill a Word\u201d by Eric Church came in. I\u2019m a fan of some \u201cChief\u201d and , apparently, my daughter is too. As soon as it came on, Bella, 6, started singing along to it. Christian, 4, started to sing with her but didn\u2019t know the words as well as she did. Looks like the fruit doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. So why am I so passionate about country music? It\u2019s simply the story of my life. It brings back some good memories and some not so good. But as Garth Brooks once said, \u201cI could have missed the pain, but I\u2019d have had to miss the dance. And I wouldn\u2019t have missed that for the world.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "When I listen to music, I listen to it because it sounds good. I pay hardly any attention to what the lyrics say or mean. Because of this, I like a lot of instrumental stuff, and bands with lots of instrumental parts in the music. I feel like my tastes are fairly widespread, delving into rock, metal, funk, and classical. I tend to go through phases where I listen to a lot of one artists music at a time. I've gone through phases where I've listened to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Strokes, Metallica, and Vulfpeck. Now, I've sort of consolidated all of my tastes into one playlist of all the music I like, even taking from some more \u201cout there\u201d groups like Mudvayne. The thing that\u2019s most important to me, definitely is the musicianship. Most of the music I listen to is complex stuff that takes a lot of talent to play right, and as a bassist, I've noticed myself becoming attracted to bands with great bassists. Joe Dart from Vulfpeck, Cliff Burton from Metallica, Ryan Martinie from Mudvayne, and Flea from RHCP have greatly influenced what I like to play, and what I listen to. So really, the thing that matters most to me is talent and musicianship, rather than sentimentality or feeling in music. Part of the reason I dislike a lot of modern pop music is because of the lack of emphasis on the music and more of an emphasis on the lyrics and on the vocalist. I recognize that many pop singers have great voices, but to me at least, they all fail to satisfy my need for more than just a good voice. I need a truly good band behind the vocalist to make a song worth listening to. Sorry if I sounded like a special snowflake in writing this! ",

Nightcore started with two guys: 'Nightcore' are two boys from Alta, named Thomas S. Nilsen and Steffen Ojala S\u00f8derholm. We mix techno/dance music into faster and more happier sounds for your listening pleasure! Our name, 'Nightcore', means that we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long.\u2019 This was in 2002, and was part of a school project. They also had DJ names, DJ TNT, and DJ SOS. These two were inspired by music created by the German band, Scooter. Scooter are a German dance group founded in Hamburg, [1] who have sold over 30 million records [6] and earned over 80 Gold and Platinum awards. [7] Scooter are considered the most successful German single-record act with 23 top ten hits.  Many tracks have high pitched vocals and a decent speed. Nightcore tracks are pretty much remixes of Dance and Rave music with higher pitches and speeds. The duo set up what is considered by the initial nightcore community to be the original definition of a track in the style, a 25% sped-up (commonly to around 160 to 180 beats per minute) and high-pitched version of a trance or eurodance song. [2] The nightcore music has been compared to happy hardcore and bubblegum bass due to its fast tempos, energetic feel and high-pitched vocals. [2] [3] [7] You can find Nightcore remixes of pretty much any genre though, which makes it greatly accessible to a number of different audiences. I love this genre of music because it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fast and pitchy and a blast to listen to. I listen to a lot of Nightcore when I\u2019m gaming. And anyone can make a Nightcore song. It\u2019s an actual community and is very popular on Youtube. I\u2019ve fallen in love with Nightcore music of mainstream songs that didn\u2019t impress me until after the fact. Here are some examples of original songs and the Nightcore version, for compare and contrast. Some people hate Nightcore because they prefer the original and don\u2019t like remixes, that is their slice, but I prefer consuming a lot of Nightcore. :) Daily. Original:  Nightcore:  ",

I admit to being drawn to works of great cultural and historical significance and import and works that show the evolution of music as an art form.  But I still have to feel it emotionally.  It doesn't matter how may experts tell me how brilliant Mozart or Bob Dylan were or are, if I did nor feel them viscerally, I would not waste my time.  Life is too short.    Appreciating music in different genres is hard, it takes time and patience , things that are often in short supply.  I remember when I first heard Hip Hop, I hated it, now I love it.  It is worth it to explore as many genres and eras as possible.  I hope I am not a snob but I do admit that I don' t understand people who say they only listen to music from the 90's or the 50's or whatever era.  I could never limit myself that way.    If I had to pick one music to listen to for the rest of my life though, it would be jazz , either Monk or Miles.  I could be reasonably happy with those two alone but I am more than overjoyed that I don't have to limit myself that way. ",

I love slide guitar, blues harmonica, etc. I also tend to like certain bands or musicians - I\u2019m heavily into Joe Bonamassa right now. One of the things I do enjoy is to set off down a YouTube rabbithole - I just start on a certain song I want to listen to and then let YouTube play the next track automatically. I often come across some really interesting new stuff, but there usually comes a point (after about an hour or so) when I have to say to myself \u201cWTF is this I\u2019m listening to?\u201d and perform a YouTube intervention on myself!

I really don't base my taste of it on anything other than what I'm hearing.  I love music that speaks to me on an emotional level. If I get goosebumps listening to a song, then that's a pretty good song. If I have any reaction, physical or mental, to a song, that song sticks with me for a long time and I don't forget it. ",

My taste in music is so hard to describe because it is literally everything except for the songs I don't like. The genres I mostly listen to include: IndieRockPunkFolkCountryHip hopClassic rockEmo/grungeJazzMetalLet's throw in a little bit of pop and edm (guilty pleasure) in there too, which makes it, basically everything. My music library consisted of 2358 songs the last time i checked. Discographies and albums of artists I love (namely, coldplay, twenty one pilots, my chemical romance, pink Floyd, greenday, Linkin park, Ed sheeran, the lumineers, the beetles, led zeppelin, guns n roses,Mumford and sons,imagine dragons, switchfoot, funeral suits, of monsters and men). I also have a ton of songs that I found in nooks and corners of YouTube, stuff that are very underrated but beautiful. I have disney songs that blared through my speakers when I was a kid (hey, don't judge, deep deep down I'm sure you did too). I have movie soundtracks (Hedwig's theme, the narnian battle song, the sound of the mocking jay, tracks from lotr. ) They are absolutely magical. I can't sing nor can I play an instrument really well, and yet, I love music. I mainly listen to the kind of music I listen to because they feel so personal and relatable. And it feels good to let go sometime. Screaming your lungs out with MCR or Linkin park, taking a roadtrip with indie and folk songs, dancing to all those catchy pop songs, head banging to Metallica, feels good huh? Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "I love a lot of music for different reasons. My favorite being rap. Let me clarify, however, that when i say rap i dont mean trap and mumble. I love lyrical rap, rap that shares a messege and/or conveys clever or impressive wordplay. It\u2019s my favorite because when writing it you can get very creative with the stories and albums as a whole as far as plot. Kendrick lamar, for example, is a rapper hailing from Compton, California. His album DAMN. tells a story of a man, after being shot and killed, reflecting on his life during his final subconscious moments and running through his emotions experienced throughout his life. HOWEVER If you listen to the album backwards the album tells a story of a man who originally was a good and god loving individual fall from grace and succumbing to the life of a thug, only to get shot and die in the end. These are both just my interpretations, but you can see my point on how the album is super in-depth. Rap is one of the few genres where you are able to do this so easily, and have so much lyrical expression That is why rap is my favorite. Another reason i love rap is it can be fused with any genre. You can have rap in country, rap in rock, rap in jazz (my favorite), rap in metal, literally anything. Its a fantastic fusion ",

I'm not big on breaking things down into sub-genres, and if I did, there would not be one sub-genre that was a favorite. That said, I have very diverse tastes in music. My most recent concert experience was Trivium and Tremonti, but I am looking at possibly attending Barry Manilow's farewell concert next month, and I also enjoy a lot of 70s AOR (album oriented rock), adult contemporary, modern country (favorite there might be Kenny Chesney, especially since he started trying to be Jimmy Buffett). I don't typically care for modern pop music, and generally dislike hip-hop (there are exceptions). Jazz I never seem to be in the mood for, though I really appreciate it.  I like a lot of music, but my favorite is heavy metal. Favorite bands include (in no particular order) Avenged Sevenfold, Trivium, Tremonti, Killswitch Engage, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "While I do like songs from all genres I prefer punk rock, pop punk, post hardcore, art\\glam rock, nu metal. . . As for why, I think it started with the fact that I wanted music I could relate to. Currently pop music is very popular and sort of the default- at least for around me. And while I could create a whole list of pop songs I love and relate to the genre as a whole wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear. It seemed as if every song I heard was about an old girl/boy friend. I just couldn\u2019t relate to that, especially since at the time I had no interest in romance or really anything like that. I wanted songs that weren\u2019t always just about love. So I started experimenting with different genres. (Obviously there are many songs about relationships in every genre and I do enjoy them but I wanted something else at that time.) It took me a while but I found some artists and bands that I really enjoy listening to and I have a variety of different styles of music and songs about many different topics ",

            "answer_text": "Classical music. Now I do understand that my preference here is mildly esoteric - especially in this bubble of popular culture encapsulating various forms of pop music. Classical music has been relegated to its shadows and fondly coined as \u201cthe oldies\u201d, but it is nevertheless not a surprise that millions of aspiring musicians still analyze this genre with immense passion, and millions more listen to hours of relaxing classical music while engaging in work endeavors. Myself included. So why the appeal? Firstly, the most famous of classical music builds upon a series of pleasing chord progressions, and frames its melody based on these chords. Notable examples include Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy and Rage over a Lost Penny, Chopin\u2019s Grande Valse Brilliante and sonata in Bb minor that was more prominently known as the \u201cFuneral March\u201d, and Tchaikovsky\u2019s Waltz of the Flowers and dream-like Nutcracker Suite that still echo in the ballet world today. These build upon common chord progressions (with me looking at the more popular examples) such as the \u201cI V vi IV\u201d chord progression which I shall not dwell on in technical jargon here, but which generate a pleasing effect to our ears, and making it very easy for ear worms to be created!! When I was merely an amateur in music, this was the main reason for my love for classical music - it is simply pleasing to listen to with a memorable melody line. Secondly, when I slowly progressing in my musical journey through tougher classical works by Schubert and Bach, I realized that classical music has various layers which build upon one another, revolving around a set of themes that never fail to surprise me. This was also the moment when I began experimenting with music composition, and I often lamented how difficult it was to create a nice melody, how difficult it was to finish a piece, and how boring and trashy it sounded when I was \u201cfinished\u201d with my \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. Being the amateur I was, I wrote down anything - really anything - that popped into my head, that sounded decent in my mind, and threw it down without considering if the various melodies actually linked. I finished with 20 different melodic lines that could have been the basis of 20 good compositions, but when put together, were more like 20 differently colored threads of my cardigan - simply an eyesore and a huge distraction too. However upon careful analysis of Beethoven\u2019s Waldstein Sonata and Pathetique Sonata (which wasn\u2019t the slightest pathetic :p), it dawned upon me the very basic theme that those two pieces lay their foundations upon through the very first introductory line. The melodies then resurfaced, with a slight twist be it in a minor key this time, more syncopated rhythms, or an extra line for harmony that gives me shivers since it reinforced the melody line. That\u2019s the beauty of classical music. It builds upon the foundation of a certain theme, plays around with it, gives you longing for more, throws in a bridging motif, and then gives you back the theme but with a slight tantalizing twist that leaves you satisfied. Go listen to Schubert\u2019s F minor Fantasie for piano duet to understand what I\u2019m saying. Lastly, there is simply so much depth in it, and the more I study it, the more I want to understand it. It\u2019s just like the saying that \u201cthe more you know, the more you know what you don\u2019t know, thus the less you know\u201d. Classical music has often showed me how much thought the composer has put in to create his piece, with thought into every little segment, yet derailing from the usual chord progressions defined by theory. So why is Faure\u2019s Barcarolle compared to Chopin\u2019s Barcarolle, so well-known despite it\u2019s huge dissonance that can seem jarring and unpleasant to the ears? Why do different pianists perform such a different rendition of the same piece, and give me such a different, yet pleasing, interpretation of the same melody, just by playing the same parts differently? Chopin\u2019s Barcarolle has many top pianists performing it - Pollini, Arthur Rubinstein, Zimerman, Kissin - and all have been compiled into a single video for simultaneous enjoyment. With Pollini\u2019s warm and lyrical playing, juxtaposed with Zimerman\u2019s hushed and worshipful performance, makes it a rather enjoyable and fulfilling musical journey for my ears. To more matured pianists, there is a never-ending thirst to fully analyze these beautiful classical works, and a passion to interpret various pianists\u2019 renditions of the same piece, that gives classical music its meaning. It is the depth of it, and the knowledge that it never gets boring, that makes me enjoy it so much. So why is it that pop music seems to be the way to go now? Well, pop music has a relatively straight forward melody line that grips listeners with hyped-up percussion/EDM/rap, funny/mildly offensive/cheeky lyrics and a desirable hot artist. You don\u2019t get that for Beethoven or Bach. But what you do get is a whole lot deeper abyss in classical music, that unfortunately, cannot compete for the attention span of a younger generation that lust for instant gratification. Not downplaying pop music, but I do believe that there\u2019s a reason why classical music has outlived the popularity of pop music and has remained a stable level of popularity over decades or so. It constantly gives you new insights, has so much potential for beauty, and never gets dry and boring. And this is why it is different from pop music. And this is why I really love classical music.

As for Indie, my absolutely all-time-favorite must be Lana Del Rey and Troye Sivan. I also listen to The Neighbourhood quite a lot. Or simply just soothing melody like Birdy, Ed Sheeran, or Tori Kelly. Bands like The 1975 or Panic! At the disco are wonderful as well. They have that a little haunted theme in their music, which is surprisingly relaxing. I reach for their music quite often but I\u2019ve never truly grow deep interest in these bands, strangely. ",

I also love intricate polyphony, especially the keyboard music of J.S. Bach and Scarlatti. I just recently started listening to American blues and bluegrass music, some jazz and old rock music from the 60s, I find the music of the middle east fascinating but I don\u2019t know enough about it to really appreciate it yet. My ears just aren\u2019t use to the many semi tones. It is pretty amazing how humans could come up with so many different types of stunningly creative and beautiful music. ",

To take you in the moment when you were experiencing that particular situation, and to be able to relive that moment every time you listen to that song.  Emotions, and only emotions, can distinguish a good composition from a great one. In general, it is said that humans tend to appreciate that music more which they have listened to in their childhood and youth. And why not, because that is the time when we are impressionable, when memories are made and kept. So, I would say emotion trumps. And broadly speaking I feel slow, soft songs are the ones which portray emotions the best. ",

Music is a big part of myself, I\u2019ve been singing for several years and it\u2019s an outlet for me, it makes me feel good. So really, I like the music I like because it fits where I am in my life, what I need to hear, where I feel I am mentally. I\u2019ve been listening to Florence and the Machine for 7 years now, she\u2019s definitely a large part of myself, she\u2019s never grown tiring to hear for me, she\u2019s relevant. I like the music I like, because it\u2019s relevant to where I am! It serves as an escape but reflects my mental state. My music taste\u2019s really had a flow over the years, it\u2019s varied in the styles I go to, but it\u2019s interesting, because when I revisit those songs/lyrics the parallels are so striking to my life at the time\u2014it\u2019s nearly disturbing! But yeah, music is very important to me, I love it. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll listen to anything, but I used to like only some of it. Sometimes, a little gem came along and changed my musical outlook.  That changed a few years ago. Steve, the singer in Fairholt, has the most amazing collection of twelve inch vinyl albums - he rarely listens to anything else, although we outvoted him on our new album, which comes out as a CD and on Vinyl in the summer. Anyway, Steve frequently introduces me to something new and often exciting. Every time I call over, I go away with a new song in my head. It's not just rock music either - lately it's been jazz from the fifties, but it can be folk, country, reggae, classical, rap, even chart stuff. He delights in finding something good in all music. And that last sentence is what I wanted to say. If you can get yourself into the frame of mind where you can find something good in all music, then you really are in a good place. It might not be the song, the arrangement, the production, or the performance. In fact it might just be a phrase, a way of playing an instrument, the counterpoint between different aspects of the recording, a sound, but it'll be there. Listen as a musician and try to find the thing you like most about a song, rather than as a dedicated follower of a genre, ready to criticise anything that falls outside your circle. It's difficult for humans to do this, because we have a strong herd instinct and like to follow the familiar, but I've found, or rather, Steve has shown me, that there is no bad music, there's just music we haven't discovered the way to love just yet.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be honest, this one\u2019s a little tricky for me, because often times the line between absolute and programmatic can be blurred in some of my favorite music (if I\u2019m taking your meaning of \u201cabsolute\u201d correctly). A great example would be Gustav Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony, \u201cResurrection\u201d (Auferstehung) - he originally devised a program for this paradigm-shifting piece, but later abandoned it, featuring a version of it only once in a 1901 premiere in Dresden. Yet, ultimately - text aside - it still remains a much more abstract piece that transcends conventional, verbal understanding and expression of the idea of \u201cthe afterlife;\u201d and it\u2019s still technically a symphony, that most absolute form of music. Now, having said all of that, I\u2019d like to abandon that piece, as much as I love it, in favor of something a little more personal (and that I believe is an even better example of absolute music, though still not the best): Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth Symphony, \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d. It can be at times bitter-sweet, and at others completely emotionally devastating. Whereas Mahler\u2019s Second represents the triumph of \u201clife over death,\u201d two years prior Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth Symphony illustrated for us more eloquently than anything else the triumph of \u201cdeath over life\u201d (and, ironically, he died a few days after the premiere). I\u2019ve shed tears while listening to the finale of Mahler\u2019s Second, but it is through Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth alone that I\u2019ve truly felt the deepest emotional fissures open. Perhaps my favorite part is the development section of the first movement - it almost reminds me of a nuclear bomb being detonated. And so it is that I cast my vote for favorite absolute music to Symphony No. 6 in B Minor, \u201cPath\u00e9tique,\u201d by Tchaikovsky. A second runner-up besides Symphony No. 2 in C Minor, \u201cResurrection,\u201d by Mahler, would be Symphony No. 7 in A Major, by Beethoven. ",

It\u2019s said that John was inspired to write this song out of his observation of a man who couldn\u2019t make his way to his loved one. The entire song is based on some events of how he was missing her and about his feelings around her. The wordings are arranged in a kinda story telling form, narrating something that happened to him. This is a nice song no doubt but underrated it seems. You may watch the video below if you wish to. The Beatles NO REPLY Easy Cover song  ",

My favorite time periods for music are most likely (from rank 1 to rank 3) the 50s, today\u2019s music, and the 80s. Some artists I like are: Micheal Jackson, Glenn Miller, Chuck Berry, Elvis (who doesn\u2019t like Elvis!?!), Gloria Estefan, Billy Joel, Prince (RIP), Little Richard, Marilyn Monroe, Red Hot Chili Peppers; and, a few notable singers from today, Lil Pump, Migos, Lil Uzi Vert, Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, and Johnny Orlando. I also like many others, as you should imagine. Take country music for example; from there, I like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Billy Ray Cyrus.

But, it can also depend on the era or decade that the music comes from. Here are some of my examples by decade: 1970s: Anything considered \u201cclassic rock\u201d nowadays: arena, psychedelic, southern, glam, progressive, punk, funk, and folk. 1980s: new wave, synthpop, soft rock, pop-rock, pop, hard rock, heavy metal, and hair metal. 1990s: grunge, alt-rock, alt-metal, Britpop, hard rock, nu-metal, rap-metal, pop-punk, pop-rock, country, New Age, rap/hip-hop, house/dance, and R&B. 2000s: alt-rock, hard rock, pop-punk, nu-metal, emo rock, electronic rock, and indie rock. 2010s: alt/indie rock, hard rock, alt-metal, electronic rock, and alt/indie pop. Other types of music: Depending on my mood, I sometimes listen to classical/symphony music and/or classic jazz. Well, there you have it. Thanks for reading my comments. Fin. ",

The question I wanted people to answer was: Do you like the RIGHT KIND of Music. There are very specific reasons why I asked it that way, and I am not merely interested in some shallow opinions about people\u2019s personal taste in music. This change of question would be as ludicrous as changing \u201cthe sound of ONE hand clapping\u201d to \u201cthe sound of TWO hands clapping. Such a change would ALSO change the challenge of this question. I am looking for DEEPER, MORE PHILSOPICAL, maybe even RELIGIOUS perspectives on the topic. I personally believe there are deep philosophical questions that few want to ask about or even think about, when it comes to music. Many of the great composers have to one degree or another STRUGGLED with such questions. Unfortunately today, most composers only struggle with how to write their next \u201chit\u201d tune, or how to please their corporate music label bosses from a contractual point of view. Thank you to those who tried to deal with MY question, and in a DEEPER way. ",

The sets are an hour or longer, conducive to really get into the music and let the sounds carry you away, somewhere in the NOW, in which all problems of the day are temporarily suspended. We stopped listening to classic rock and oldies because all we saw are artists that did not age well, couldn't sing anymore how they used to, but still demanded high prices to see them. People pay good money for memories of \u201cthe good old days\u201d. Well, these days are good too and rather than dwelling in the past, we decided to go with the times and love it. In the past 4 years we attended several major EDM festivals and attend almost weekly an EDM show. We dance, we laugh, we have fun for days to come. We have conservative jobs, have 6 adult children, and live a middle class life. So everyone can have fun with this music. Lay the judgments aside and try it out. Visit us on YouTube under EDM4EvrYoung, and Twitter, and FB, and Instagram, and Snapchat. We love EDM and wished more our age would discover this fountain of youth! Try it! ",

Some examples Led Zeppelin Pink Floyd Jethro Tull Yes Black Sabbath Will always love the Beatles I'm also really into some types of punk, like NoFX, Rancid, the Mighty Mighty Boss tones, the Ramones and Sex Pistols are great Those are the main bands/genres but I generally listen to anything that isn't modern day hip hop, country or screamo.

            "answer_text": "Here are some genres I prefer the most. Symphonic metal. I love the strong tempo and the powerful orchestral background, also the contrasts between the female singer\u2019s clear voice and the male\u2019s screaming. I\u2019m a big fan of Nightwish and I like Within Temptation and Epica too.Gothic metal. Well, I just like the style of music. Also I prefer female vocals than male vocals. Lacuna Coil is one of my preferred bands.Classical music. My love for it lasts for a long time. I listen to Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto for more than 5 years without getting tired of it. Plus, you don\u2019t want to listen to Nightwish when you have to sit down and do your math homework.Cinema music. I love John Williams, Ennio Morricone and Joe Hisashi\u2019s works.Some anime songs. Though most of them don\u2019t sound really good but there\u2019s some really excellent songs like This Game from the anime No Game No Life.Musicals. The songs are usually excellent that they blend classical and modern elements in them. Les Miz, The Phantom of the Opera and The Lion King are some of my favorites.I don\u2019t really listen to pop music like my keens because they just follow the same mode. And some of them sound really stupid. So when it comes to music there\u2019s almost nothing to talk about unless I met a metalhead. And most of the metalheads I know are not into symphonic metal. I\u2019ll be very happy if someone wants to talk about Nightwish with me. ",

Then I was born and partly raised in Cuba. Prior to the revolution that destroyed the popular Cuban music industry, we had a thriving one with many groups, many styles and many talented artists from other countries like Mexico, Argentina, D. R. and Chile who visited and gave concerts in the island nation. In other words, you could walk the streets of Havana and listen to great popular music free of charge and start singing with whomever was singing. I miss those days. Imagine being a child with such great variety of music and great talent like Celia Cruz, Rita Montaner, Benny More\u2019 and his band, Rolando La Serie and his band, Marta Perez. The great Mexican singer Pedro Vargas, the Argentinian tango singer and actress, Libertad Lamarque. I had a similar experience in NYC in the late sixties and early seventies where you heard great Motown music, the Beatles and other great artists. It was a great time to be around. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a huge fan of what is broadly labeled \u201cclassical\u201d music. However, for those who know their musical periods, the Romantics are my favorites. That would be primarily the 19th Century. I\u2019m always discovering \u201cnew\u201d music from that time period\u2026 I also love folk & ethnic music from various cultures. In a composition class I took in college, I mentioned drawing inspiration from Indian classical music for a piece I wrote, and the professor found that I knew more about the subject than he did! He asked if I could prepare a brief overview of Indian classical music, particularly the ragas played on the sitar; and our next assignment was to compose and perform ragas of our own. Indonesian gamelan music is truly amazing - a whole other sound world. And I love the music of ethnic Rom (Gypsies) and Bulgaria. I\u2019m also fascinated with 20th Century and living composers. The Impressionists (Debussy & Ravel) are among my favorites. Like many, I feel that the Post-Modernists\u2019 experiments with serialization, 12-tone and minimalism are deeply unsatisfying; but I accept that they needed to be tried. I feel there\u2019s still much to be learned from jazz and folk idioms. I have been pondering over a second symphony for years (my first, which I wrote in high school, is very much in imitation of Romantic styles), and just yesterday heard an excellent recording of Leos Janacek\u2019s Sinfonietta on the radio. I\u2019m familiar with this unusual piece, but suddenly it clicked: I must study and compare Janacek\u2019s use of the orchestra with, say, Tchaikovsky\u2019s. It\u2019s extremely different, more sparse yet expansive - and may be the sort of approach I need to take. I\u2019m also partial to film scores, especially if they\u2019re done well. I feel that John Williams is perhaps one of the finest living composers. Korngold\u2019s scores and the reconstructions of Prokofiev\u2019s Alexander Nevsky and Sir Arthur Bliss\u2019 Things to Come are also among my favorites. ",

Every time I listen this song I am so shacked and can feel God's love .I know it's God saves me and lead me out painful life. I thank God deeply for giving me chance to know Him. If I were not saved by God, I would still be drifting in this world,struggling hard and painfully in sin, every day gets bleak and hopeless.If I were not saved by God, I\u2019d still be crushed below the devil\u2019s feet,snared in sin and its enjoyments, ignorant of what my life would be.If I were not saved by God, I\u2019d be without my blessings here today,much less know why we should live on or the meaning of our lives.If I were not saved by God, I\u2019d still be confused about my faith,still in empty space passing the days, unaware in whom to put my faith.I have finally understood God\u2019s loving hand holds mine as we go.I would never go and lose my way \u2019Cause I\u2019m on this brilliant course to stay.I have finally understood God\u2019s intent, earnest to man.False impressions fully removed. I will give my flesh and soul to God.If I were not saved by God, I\u2019d be without my blessings here today,much less know why we should live on or the meaning of our lives.If I were not saved by God, I\u2019d still be confused about my faith,still in empty space passing the days, unaware in whom to put my faith.I have finally understood God\u2019s loving hand holds mine as we go.I would never go and lose my way \u2019Cause I\u2019m on this brilliant course to stay.I have finally understood God\u2019s intent, earnest to man.False impressions fully removed.

Piano based rock? Your delusional. But no, really. Try listening to Evanescence. Amy Lee does vocals in the band, and she also plays the piano, harp, and keyboard. Her solo Speak To Me and Love Exists are emotional and piano based sad songs. From Evanescence, the songs Hello, Like You, My Immortal, Lithium, My Heart Is Broken, Lost In Paradise, The End Of The Dream, Secret Door, Swimming Home, and the entire Synthesis album gives me chills for their sad and hollow sounds. Also, pop-rock, like Los Angeles by Blink-182 and How Does It Feel? by Tonight Alive comes up at a close second for my favourite music style. I don\u2019t even know if this is a thing, but the sound is usually bouncy and catchy, but dark. Left Alone by Sleeping With Sirens, Vicious by Halestorm, and Lithium by Nirvana are examples of this genre. The band Zero that i found out about today has an absolutely amazing song that falls under this genre, called W W Y D F, which stand for what would you die for. I recommend it to everyone. ",

I love it because it ranges from Pink Floyd to Tull to Genesis to RUSH to Crimson to Spock\u2019s Beard to Porcupine Tree to Steven Wilson, et al. The music is complex, but speaks to me. Sections are through-composed; the song lengths supersede 5 minutes. It\u2019s like listening to a bunch of epic masterpieces. Classical Music contains epics in many movements, and I listen to quite a bit of it. However, Progressive Rock offers me more\u2026 Type in some of the names above and listen to it without distractions.

But, to answer the question, I enjoy alternative rock, all the way from its roots in R.E.M. and Sonic Youth, to the beginnings of Nirvana, Alice in Chains, The Melvins. Then comes the pop punk stuff I adore, such as Green Day, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, The Killers, and so on. I also greatly enjoy the garage-blues-rock of The White Stripes, The Black Keys, and Royal Blood. I enjoy this genre because I love being rebellious and being able to think freely, without the chains of convention. There's no shredding guitar leads that show you how cool Slash is. Every instrument comes together in a modest symphony to become one great song. Alternative rock truly comes from the hearts of geniuses, who only want to express themselves through distortion pedals, beat up drums, low strung bass guitars, and honest lyrics. ",

            "answer_text": "When people ask me this question or one similar, I have to ask them to specify; to play, or to listen to? To play, I currently take an interest in classical styles. I was trained in traditional Scottish up until about the age of fourteen and I still enjoy that style. There are very few rules in traditional Scottish music; you can, with a few exceptions, play in any tempo you see fit, often the fastest you can possibly manage. There are slower tunes, which give leeway for some amazing ornaments, vibrato and other techniques that you often add as you please, making the piece your own. I prefer playing in classical at the moment, though. Classical pieces can be both fun and challenging to play, and I love being able to notice a composer's individual style as I play. The piece I\u2019m currently studying is Bouree by J.S Bach. I listen to classical music as well, most commonly to study - my favourite piece to listen to at the moment is Sonata No.9 in A Major, Kreutzer by Beethoven, which is unfortunately above my playing abilities. But if I'm under no obligation to focus, I listen to quite a wide variety. I have almost no regard for the genre; if I like it, I'll listen to it. I usually like songs with what I consider to be meaningful lyrics, and that can come under any genre from electronic to indie to alternative rock. I also take an interest in any kind of music my friends recommend to me. My current favourite song is \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d by Annika Rose. The only kinds of music I never listen to are the current charts and mainstream rap. ",

It was bands like Alex\u2019s, Bowie, Mott The Hoople, and The Sweet that made me want to get really good at playing it. And the nonchalant genius of Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi, and Frank Zappa made me stick at it, trying to improve as there was always something they did that I couldn\u2019t fathom out. When I discovered Funk a whole new world appeared to open before me. Loosen up on the rhythm thing, there. See what happens when you slip in a couple of jazz chords? Niiice\u2026 Mothers Finest pushed me to the Funk. Their Iron Age album was a groovy blend of Rock and Funk and I got hooked. Hell, hook, line, sinker, AND copy of Angling Times. From there Sly Stone was beckoning and sultry Betty Davis was giving me the eye. Well, it would have been churlish to refuse. And finally, the Man himself. Pilot of the mothership, on the One. Mighty George Clinton. So there you have it. I listen to lots of different styles, lots of different languages but my favourites\u2026 well, there they are. ",

Whilst I enjoy listening to recorded music, the experience of seeing and hearing musicians do their stuff in front of a live audience is, to me, what music is all about. I also prefer to experience music in small venues, rather than in vast stadiums, so most of the stuff I go to see (or book) involves musicians most people will not have heard of. Whilst some of the players involved will have played on large stages as supporting musicians to a \u201cname\u201d, many will only have a local reputation, but their lack of fame is in no way a reflection of their musical ability. Believe me, there are some great players out there and, with a bit of research and experience, you can find them playing for a small cover charge or even free (to the punter) at a venue near you!  ",

My strong preference for music is German with lieder and opera at the peak. It seems my musical tastes froze going backwards around age 18. For years after moving to NY 1972, I was in the Opera house regularly. The intensity of my medical career killed all forms of live entertainment, just never had the time. To this day I am at work in my department 16-18 even 20 hours a day, not including 24 hour in-hospital call 6\u20138 times per month. Being here doesn't always mean actual performance. There is down time. Reading, writing, and music listening keep me down to earth and at peace with the long work hours. ",

My music background is really colorful in relation to styles. I was a Nirvana freak in my teens. Listened to a lot of heavy metal, alternative, grange etc. Later on I listened to a lot of the boy bands (N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, Boyzone and especially Take That, I have huge respect for Gary Barlow). Then I started exploring the world of the American Pop Country music, the Nashville kind of pop music. I like the catchy melody, beautiful acoustic guitars in the songs and all that.  Then when I started producing music myself I was kind of 'forced' by the clients to listen to lot of the Balkan music because I live and create here. Recently I really like to listen all the EDM stuff, especially Calvin Harris (I regard him as really talented and unique in the world of this music). Good place for electronic music is this online radio Digitally Imported - addictive electronic music  Oh, I almost forgot. One of the most influental musician in my life was and still is Kenneth Babyface. This man is a mind blowing talent and his music is full with soul and such a sensitivity like no other.  So that's it in general. Kind of rambling all around, but so was my interest in different kinds of music throughout my life :) ",

My 60s-70s rock is mainly David Bowie, the Who, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the like, and I have CDs from artists like the Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Steve Miller Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2026 I\u2019m also a HUGE fan of artists like Ed Sheeran, Nate Ruess, Halsey, Beyonc\u00e9, and Stromae (a Belgian artist), but that\u2019s about as pop as I go.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Before I answer your question specifically, I'd like to mention that, as a musician and studio engineer, I've given a lot of thought to the notions of how we listen. The complete version is beyond the scope of what I can answer here, but the gist of it is that we choose music based on who we are rather than the music itself. As we learn and grow in life, our musical tastes and preferences will change in keeping with the person we have grown to become. As the cycle continues, music becomes an increasingly greater gift to us. Here is a list of a few of my personal favorites. This is copied over from another answer I gave to the question, \"Why is music getting worse, and if it is, what can we do about it?\" As you'll see from the list, I don't think it's getting worse at all.  For jazz, Hiromi Uehara totally knocks my socks off. Of special note is her song \"Desire,\" from The Hiromi Trio. Hiromi's version of \"I've Got Rhythm,\" is insane. For rock guitar, Steffan Schackinger, Pete Thorn, and Mike Hermans are fantastic. For finger style guitar, check out Tommy Emmanuel, Smokin\u2019 Joe Robinson, Andy McKee, or Antoine Dufour. For pop orchestra, Lucia Micarelli. Her performance of \"Emmanuel\" with Chris Botti is awesome as well as her rendition of Kashmir by Led Zeppelin. For nostalgic pop, the Kennedy Center Honors concerts are just amazing. For Old Time music, the Guy\u2019s All Star Shoe Band with Prairie Home Companion on NPR is a groove to set your heart free. Rich Dworsky just kills it on stride piano with the song  \u201cOut of the Bucket.\" For acappella vocal music, have a listen to Pentatonix and Pitch Perfect. Thanks again and happy listening. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite music is probably alternative indie or pure instrumental. I used to be super into pop and rock, but I started wanting more from my music so I delved into sub-genres of the two. There I found Gorillaz and Three Days Grace, they\u2019re still great bands but weren\u2019t giving me the sound I craved. I got tired of searching, and asked for song recommendations from people around me, Youtube, and Spotify. When I heard pure instrumental (that wasn\u2019t classical), it was Shibuya by Covet. I fell in love with Yvette Young\u2019s guitar skills, it\u2019s what hooked me onto their music! Then for alt-indie, I just went through Bandcamp. I\u2019m not sure if bedroom pop counts but Moonweather is such a good band, there are so many others but that\u2019s the band that I think of when asked \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite music/band?\u201d ",

If Bethoven had an electric guitar he would be a Rockstar \u2026 music is wavea of sound and when you like one kind of music this means the waves of the music correspond to your brains waves! So after you listen to the new kids of Rock, go a bit older joint and listen to Linkin Park, Greenday, sting, U2, the Rolling stones, and offcourse IronMaiden and Mettalika the gods of Rock\u2026 Good luck\u2026 I still love traditional Arab music, but love the Rock waves\u2026.

About 5+ years ago, it would have been Jpop with a major lead. If wondering why, it\u2019s a few reasons. I personally think both countries artists (and/or companies who produce them) simply do better. Both with music composition and song composition. Also, perhaps partially because I DON\u2019T understand the languages as well. The songs could be as inane as anything out from The Chainsmokers or such, and I thankfully wouldn\u2019t realize. I am sure some are, the songs are just a bit too short, there\u2019s far too many repetitions of the chorus, much like most American music. ",

I go mad for a capella vocal groups, but especially those from Dalmatia, the Caucasus, and Corsica (of course, this includes early doo-wop in the US, before its commercial instrumentation). My favorite music for years has been Portuguese Fado, with Brazilian bossa nova, Argentine zamba, Greek Rebetika and Balkan string music rounding out my \u201cworld music\u201d agenda. This, added to my interest in rock\u2019n\u2019roll from the 50s thru the 80s, with emphasis on the Kinks, rounds out my big list (once a member of a Kinks copycat band - ended up doing many covers of their songs). Depending upon my mood, any of these get hearing often. But Fado most often, Rebetika second, opera third. ",

It isn't unusual to see me listening to classical music because the complex nature of some pieces are just exquisite. My favorite is Beethoven. I also play viola, piano, cello, violin, and trombone, so that also takes a part of it. I also love rap music. I know, the two don't usually go together, but I'm not into rap for the meaning most times. I always envied the flow most rappers have and how creative they are with their lyrics. My favorite is Fortune Family and Eminem. Of course there are others, but my counselor needs me so unfortunately I can't continue. Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that Classical Music is the most stimulating. It is more complex than at least certain other types of music. It encompasses more types of instruments in more combinations. (Just the other day, I heard a piece written for harp and castanets, just those two. I'd never heard anything with that combination playing by themselves. It was fascinating!) Each instrument family has its own special types of possible sounds. In my opinion, one can never get bored at such a performance because there's so much to watch, zeroing in on perhaps the strings playing a pizzicato passage, or the brass using mutes, or the percussion playing all manner of instruments that add flavor and ethnicity to the music. Then, to watch and listen to a classical singer, with the technique and artistry they can bring to the mix, well, that's all just heaven to me! ",

I didn\u2019t understand the meaning, just a whole lot of accents and percussion to words. Even to this day, I notice I still use their \u2018voice words\u2019 as music. I meet people everywhere I go and I have to learn to be a good listener. Or else I wouldn\u2019t communicate and give them an answer. Might as well listen to the darn beach noises in seashells and never answer back cause I don\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re trying to tell me. Anyway, for example, how I see or hear music in everything. The gym coach said to \u2018jab,cross, pull back, jab, cross.\u2019 And I couldn\u2019t hear him over the loud blaring rock music, but I picked up the sounds and recognize the muffled words, those darn cymbals, and answer back by doing the exercise drill he told the class to do. I don\u2019t think I like music because of music, I liked music because I was walking around listening to the new faces and in their way of speaking. Music is also a good way to drown out your uncles, aunts, cousins, sisters, brothers, the good ol pops, and mother. ",

If the weather is good and you need some peace of mind then Rock music helps. Some of my favorite bands are Dream Theatre, Opeth, Porcupine tree, Pink Floyd !!! Not much a Bollywood guy but then definitely old chichora Hindi songs of Govinda, Akshay, Saif, Sunil shetty resonate really awesome if you are in that mood. There are times when I am just alone and Dev Anand and kishore kumar ji songs soothe me. Finally, Punjabi songs being a Punjabi guy is a revered practice in here. One should listen to various types as you dont know what is your taste untill you really listen to them. A big fan of coke studio and the music there is just awefishingsome. Till then, keep listening and stay awesome :) ",

My phone favorite was Pacific overtures by Stephen Sondheim it was so crazy dumbest pure Kabuki theater in 1976 very unusual for Broadway all male actors even playing female roles and it has some really great songs..Please Hello being the showstopper. My fourth choice would have to be Oklahoma because it felt was subject matter that was quite difficult to deal with this the time and I would also have to add Show Boat along with that. My number five choice would be song time again..Company\u2026 which also had great individual songs no plot but it is often considered to be the first modern style musical.
