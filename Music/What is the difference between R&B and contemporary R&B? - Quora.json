            "answer_text": "Okay get ready for this one, gonna be A LOT OF TYPING *WARNING* BUTTTTTTTTTT! I think the lines between R&B and Contemporary R&B are muddled in a way, but kind of distinctive. And I say that because R&B is rhythm and blues which is essentially the melodic, climatic, and beautiful dynamics of the riffs, chants, and hums mixed with instrumentation inspired by the African-American rooted genres of Gospel, Funk, blues usually built off a single baseline or melody or drum beat and it\u2019s seen all through out R&B History. Starting from Otis Redding to Beyonc\u00e9 and even more recent artists like H.E.R. Or jorja Smith and so many more. But the distinction comes in artists like Miguel, Sza, Frank Ocean, and Khalid and the earlier but more recent mentioned artists H.E.R. and Jorja Smith (to name a few), Contemporary R&B is R&B with a modern tinge to it, whether it be surrene ambience on \u201cSierra Leone\u201d in Channel Orange by Frank Ocean , or rough guitar on \u201cPussy is Mine\u201d in Kaleidoscope Dream by Miguel. They each take bits and pieces of musical ideas from their GENRE CONTEMPORARIES (*hint* *hint* *wink* *wink*) like Funk for heavy basses, or Jazz for the settled yet swinging rhythm of drums, pop is just popular music so anything on the radio, and hip-hop and etc. But, remember when I said this was muddled? WELLLLLLLLL historically speaking Contemporary R&B and well.. R&B are synonymous in a sense that a more traditional R&B from WAAAAAYYY back in the days like the 50s or 60s   It ARGUABLY (In my opinion!!) wouldn\u2019t gain as much commercial success as it would now (2010s-20s). The genre was marketed essentially (to be blatant) as contemporary black people music that stood out for its combination of funk, gospel, jazz and Negro-spirituals. The genre was born contemporary so it is contemporary right??? Well yes and no, truthfully because of the common understanding that the older \u2018Golden Era\u2019 Of R&B being imbetween the 60\u2019s and 80\u2019s, and the extreme effort in production and unique musical rhythms, melodies and songwriting. Like I can\u2019t stress this alone, these 3 THINGS!!!! 1.) the 5th studio album of Prince known as \u201c1999\u201d was a classic and it pushed him to mega stardom, because Ik I\u2019m writing a lot I\u2019m gonna let this video convey that point.  2.) Thriller was definitely cutting edge for the decade and imo it put Michael YEARS if not 2 decades or a decade and a half ahead of his contemporaries at the time 3.) New R&B comes up short in the mainstream department in comparison to its older predecessors in a sense that I\u2019ll definitely pick a Stevie Wonder over a Drake any day. And say that because of Stevie\u2019s influence in the Golden years. The artists who did that for R&B and carried it like stevie wonder have HISTORY. So we need to give the \u201cbabies\u201d more time to shine and grow to see if it even compares to the Classics So in final thoughts, The extreme effort put into every Classic in those Golden Era Decades will always stand out to a classic music listener as \u201cTraditional R&B\u201d not Contemporary. But in my opinion It doesn\u2019t really matter ",

            "answer_text": "Contemporary R&B is easy to distinguish - it\u2019s more pop-based music from the likes of M. Jackson, Withney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, Usher, Beyonc\u00e9, Rhianna, Bruno Mars, John Legend, Pharrell and others. The original Rhythm and Blues started as a term in the 1940\u2019s and have different connotations depending on whom you ask. I will associate the term with certain blues and rock related artists like Fats Domino, Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, The Platters, early Elvis and so on.
