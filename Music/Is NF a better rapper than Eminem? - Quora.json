            "answer_text": "People bring up stuff eminem did years ago..nf is on nobodys lists like Joyner Lucas, logic and others. Problem with nf is while he has songs that make you think..he raps about very little . me personally I look at artist challenging themselves, giving something nobody if person is a fan of rap they will love..Eminem\u2019s ability to rap about anything is what I love .eminem gives you biology lessons, you literally feel like you are in school listening . I know people that dislike rap but they love Eminem , a few of his songs, \u201clike home\u201d \u201chills remix\u201d any track on his new album..people say Eminem swears he didn't or any of his past 3 albums. He even mentioned stuff his dad did in a track and it sounds. Eminem has one major issue his vocabulary and verses. Eminem can say one bar that has 3,4 meanings. He is very complex . people miss so much of what he is saying . music to be murdered by did you guys hear every track .think nf is even close? Umm OK? I listened to a few nf songs I can see why people like him at the same time I can see how he bores people . Eminem uses words and phrases that have people going how in the heck did he put that into a verse. Eminem you have to listen to several times. He is punished for that big time ..people don't want to figure out what you are saying or have to have a dictionary handy lol. You listen to his homicide verse. He gave a biology lesson plus used words people have no clue what they mean..who uses \u201clull\u201d in a verse he made it flow so well if people knew what it meant. Eminem is the only rapper to ever blow me away . have you ever listened to the reaction videos everytime they paue they think of something or somebody else Eminem was referring to.. Nf has same theme every track gets old to many. Eminem can have a full album and every track is different . nf won't change cause what some like..you can't put nf on same level or mention in same breath as Eminem except for being a white rapper . lyrically eminem destroys nf. Word play em destroys every white rapper people want to compare to Eminem ..eminem opened the doors for white rappers. Please stop comparing eminem to other white rappers. G eazy said it perfectly when he mentioned eminem is the goat but don't compare him to Me. Eminem even now at almost 50 tops most list. Others have him behind 2pac, rakim legendsetc..rakim even said if em was black he would be the Ali of Rap. Umm what was Ali to boxing. Eminem can beat you in so many ways now .when he is angry it is over for anybody. ",

            "answer_text": "Through the years of knowing and hearing Eminem we all can say he is better than NF\u2026 But can we say that now? Side note: NF started his career in 2010, and came out with the debut album called Moments.We know that Eminem came out with a diss about NF, The Ringer, shortly after NF came out with a diss about Eminem, Returns. Although, we can now say that Eminem is getting worse through the years. Why can we say that? Well, he used to be everybody's top ten, but coming to find out HE IS NOT. To everyone out there that likes Justin Bieber, I like him personally, Justin has more fans than Eminem. Justin has over 90.1 million fans and Eminem only has 45.1 million fans. But it is weird that everyone is better than Justin Bieber but Eminem \u201cThe Greatest Rapper Alive\u201d can\u2019t be better than Justin?? JUSTIN!! Aside from talking about Eminem and Justin\u2026 Lets get back to NF and Eminem. NF came out with a new album called The Search. Now, Returns, is in this album. Yes, NF is a commercial rapper, but when he sings he has the flow and it GOES TO THE BEAT!! On the other hand, Eminem is a poem rapper which is more powerful than a commercial rapper. But Eminem is still on Kamikaze, he is now a choppy rapper and we can all say that is true. ",
