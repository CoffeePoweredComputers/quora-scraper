            "answer_text": "You have picked a huge song with a difficult time signature. The vocal sounds very tentative (as though the singer is unsure of themselves), and that\u2019s no surprise. By the time a pro lays down a final vocal there are years of training, thousands of hours of practice. Justin may have worked on that vocal for weeks, on and off before finalizing his ideas, practiced for several hours running it down before going in to track the finals you hear. No need to beat yourself up, it\u2019s awesome you are going for it however, you might want to go a little easier on yourself and pick some songs that are easier to sing. Straight 4/4 time, simple melodies, not too wide of a vocal range to begin with. As for getting a better vocal sound? Back off the mic a bit, perhaps 12\u2033 or so. Use a pop screen\u2026 This will keep you from creeping up on the mic, and kill any plosives before they happen. Use some light compression, 4:1 ratio, a fairly fast attack, and a release time that gets the needle back to zero in time for the next phrase and to the beat of the music\u2026 about a half a measure (2 beats). The amount of gain reduction you are going for (the amount the needle swings to the left), is about 3dB or a little bit more. You are only trying to gently knock down the hard peaks at this time to smooth the vocal out a bit and reduce the dynamic range a pinch. A good compressor that is free in Pro Tools, is The Bomb Factory 1176. The knobs are backwards, so attack and release are faster the farther you turn the knobs to the right. You should not hear the compressor working, other than the vocal sounding smoother and closer to you. The input knob sets the ammount of compression, the output knob sets the makup/return level. One thing you will discover, is there are endless ways to get to your desired result. Hopefully you will soon be sharing your techniques with us so that I may gain some new tricks for my bag!

            "answer_text": "I'm sorry to say this, but the vocal performance on your test recording is pretty disconnected rhythmically from the track. Your brother lacks the rhythmic perception necessary for a great vocal performance. If he's serious about addressing this, he should start working with a good vocal coach. drum lessons with a good teacher would also help him to get this together. Of course those are discouraging things to hear. Doing music well is not easy. That's why you don't see many musicians with suntans... Great musicians playing together on a stage aren't spacing out in their own worlds, they're profoundly listening and reacting to every note being played, perceiving the relationships between what they're hearing and their own playing. Much of Justin's vocal on the original lines up rather precisely with the track. Syllables here and there land before and after the eighth notes of the track. that feels expressive, because the performance is grounded in great rhythmic awareness. Justin's vocal is rather softly annunciated, he's not trying to sing a drum part. But he's well interacting with the rhythms of the track. Unfortunately for many, sliding notes around in software can only do so much. It's not really possible to 'edit a performance into greatness' that wasn't great to begin with. Hope this helps. ",
