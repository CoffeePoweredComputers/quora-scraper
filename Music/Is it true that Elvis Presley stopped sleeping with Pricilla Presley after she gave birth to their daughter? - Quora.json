            "answer_text": "True. Elvis was sexually repulsed by a woman who had become a mother. At that point he would stop any sexual connect between them. This was true with Priscilla. An association would begin (in Elvis\u2019 psyche), between any mother, and HIS mother. It came too close to \u201cfeeling\u201d he was being sexual with his mom. I think it\u2019s fair to assume Elvis never tried psychological counseling.  Elvis had a lot of loss early in life. His relationship with his mother was intense and likely riddled with emotional difficulties. Very generally, when boys are young, they do what their mothers ask them to. They help and are rewarded with affection and praise. But there\u2019s a point when a boy instinctively begins to model his father (shaves with a bit of cardboard, etc). I don\u2019t believe Elvis made that singular switch, and didn\u2019t stop trying to please his mother. A mother who allows this to happen is often narcissistic, she wants to hold on to her son, as long as she can (forsaking her husband emotionally and sexually). As a result, the son ends up tied to his narcissistic mother, who believes everything is all about her and after that, her son. It\u2019s the genesis of Elvis\u2019 sexual difficulties.

            "answer_text": "One of the things which precipitated Priscilla\u2019s affair with Mike Stone, is that Priscilla wanted to try for a boy but Elvis wanted to go on tour. Elvis already had at least one illegitimate daughter that he knew of, and one son whom he named Tommy after Col. Parker. The lyricist knew about this when writing Don\u2019t Cry Daddy: Don't cry, daddyDaddy, please don't cryDaddy, you've still got me and little TommyAnd together we'll find a brand new mommy\u2026 Altogether, was the father of about 9 children, including a son named Philipp (? spelling) who has changed his name to Elvis Aaron Presley Jr. ",
