            "answer_text": "I don't know if you were shading TWICE but I got that feeling. When you asked Are there other songs worse than TWICE'S? that naturally gives an impression that TWICE'S FANCY is bad as you set it to comparison. Anyway I am sure there are lots of other songs worse than FANCY. But at the end its your music taste. For me I loved FANCY. It brings new taste to the regular TWICE'S cute and colourful concept. So if you don't like FANCY thats your choice. May be something you like doesn't necessary mean that I like. Anyway I would say there are worse songs than FANCY but then its my taste of music choice too. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 that is a very subjective question I am assuming you don\u2019t stan twice and therefore don\u2019t like the song? But, for me personally I loved the song, as I am a huge ONCE myself In all honesty, it depends on your own personal taste. Whenever I am not to fond of a song I don\u2019t listen to it for a week or so, and then give it another try. Some songs take multiple listens to get used to. I hope you give FANCY another shot because it\u2019s a bop\u2026 but if you don\u2019t like it try some songs on the album\u2026 or if your PROACTIVE and NOT hatful, try listening to other songs or watch variety shows to get into twice Thanks!
