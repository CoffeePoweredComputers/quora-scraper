            "answer_text": "Firstly, figure out if you like the pop/rock sound of a sax, or the more rounded, controlled classical sound. Also, do you want to read scores for a classical wind ensemble or improvise with a jazz band or throw back your hair as a rock soloist? Then you can start looking for a teacher. You don't want to land up with someone who is happy for you to growl when all you want is to sound like a clarinet and play in a sax Bach ensemble- or vice versa! Saxophonists have strong feelings about sound and it will affect your playing and development if someone keeps telling you that the sounds you want to produce are \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. Because sax is a popular gigging instrument. most good players are more than happy to fill up their diaries playing at functions, concerts, theatre musicals and the like. So be careful when selecting a teacher. Have you heard them play? What do they think about the various sound aesthetics mentioned above? Can they improvise? How do their students play? If they take exams, what were their scores? Are they really a sax teacher, or a good clarinet teacher looking to branch out? ",

            "answer_text": "First, don't go it alone at the beginning. This doesn't necessarily have to involve private lessons. Just getting tips from someone with a couple years of experience can be quite helpful just to make sure you're not doing things massively wrong. Second, get a copy of the Universal Method for Saxophone. I'd recommend the spiral-bound version because it will sit better on a music stand and not fall apart. If you end up taking lessons, they're going to make you buy a copy of this anyhow, so you might as well go straight to it. Third, it's also a good idea to have someone with experience play your instrument (before you start, and any time you have inexplicable trouble) just to make sure it doesn't have any substantial problems that need addressing. Nothing is more frustrating than not being able to control the instrument, especially if you can't tell whether the fault lies with you, your reed, or your instrument. Being able to eliminate one of the three possibilities will help. ",

I live in Hyderabad and I have no idea about where you'd find a tutor in Bangalore. Sorry about that.  How hard/how easy it is to learn saxophone depends on your control over your breath. (At least as far as I think so about any instrument powered by your lungs) It's better if you buy one to start learning(take your tutor along to buy yourself one) because you wouldn't want to share your saxophone with others.
