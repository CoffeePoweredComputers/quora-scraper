            "answer_text": "Everyone has different opinions and views on what they think about how John Lennon really felt about Mick Jagger and the rolling stones. When it comes to the celebrity world their our mysteries drama and all sorts of crazy stories. It's way to hard to pick and know what is true and not. Nobody has a real answer on why John lennon often changed his views. Yes people do have opinions that they state is right. But nobody really knows how John Lennon thinks unless he was physically asked. My advice to you is to stay out of the internat and what people say about celebs. I personally do this but I'm not trying to offend anyones opinions. I respect everyones opinion and they have the privaledge to have one. But for me until the actual celebrity opens up on whatever controversial topic people have been arguing about I dont believe anything the internet says. My opinion is that John might have had a time where he felt close and happy with mick and the rolling stones. However as their life took separate ways from each other they drifted apart. Competion and tension became to occur for each of them. That is my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "This sort of question has been put in many forms, from the Beatles falling out, to friends of the Beatles falling out. I can only imagine this is a National difference, between American and English culture. English people do fall-out, and if they are real friends, make up. It really isn\u2019t that deep, perhaps if violence or murder happens, but even then, people do forgive the murderer. From IRA Bombs killing men, women and children, to War victims. I have read many interviews John Lennon would \u201chave a go at\u201d people, from some Fans calling Yoko ugly, to Beatles members, to other musicians John felt aggrieved with. Then they would go around for Dinner, at that person\u2019s home. Sometimes on the same day, but THAT doesn\u2019t get reported. John Lennon loved Mick Jagger, especially Keith Richards, he went on long car journeys into the English countryside with Keith, they loved each other\u2019s company. Keith called John \u201csweet\u201d. NO! they weren\u2019t Gay. It\u2019s just how the English are, well the English people I know. PLEASE GET REAL, they ALL used this to get Album sales, it really is so unimportant. ",
