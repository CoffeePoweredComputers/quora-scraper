            "answer_text": "This is an oldie but a goodie. So Solid Crew were a group from Battersea in London who played UK garage. They had UK chart success in early 2000\u2019s with five top 20 singles. They were notorious for several reasons; some of their members had brushes with the law and, more relevantly for this answer, So Solid Crew were legion. Initially the group had 19 members, though this expanded to 30 at one point. 21 Seconds  Yet a roster of 30 wasn't enough for one Wikipedia wag, who expanded the So Solid Crew to hundreds of members. Wikipedia\u2019s So Solid Crew member list This list is a work of beauty and wit. It features the great and the good (like Queen Elizabeth II, Terry Wogan), politicians (then leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister David Cameron), TV characters (Boss Hogg, Michael Knight and KITT) and fictional scallywags like Calpol SixPlus, Supa Soaka, Notorious BLT and Spewy Hewy. I would pay good money to see Spewy Hewy have a rap battle with Queen Liz, wouldn't you? Wikipedia unfortunately took a dim view of this and took the list down. Fortunately someone made a copy and put it online.  A little something extra for the DJ Wogan massive - Peter Serafinowicz impersonating Old Tel hosting a pirate radio broadcast.  ",
