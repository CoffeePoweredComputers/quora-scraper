            "answer_text": "Do YOU know the true you? Isn\u2019t it changing all the time as you age? Unless you sit down with your parents every now and then and talk openly with them about what worries you, what you enjoy, what your hopes for the future are, what they do that you love, what they do that bugs you (phrased politely, of course), they won\u2019t have a clue. Ask them about when they were children. What did they like to do? How did they make friends? What did they hate about school? What did they like about it? If you get to know them, you\u2019ll find they\u2019re willing to get to know you, too. And it may change your opinion of them. I know I was stunned when I heard how my mother suffered as a child, orphaned at the of 10, physically handicapped, embarrassed at the way she looked, raised by a harsh grandmother who only wanted the insurance money. I looked at the loving way she was raising us, and realized how hard she was trying to be a good mother. My parents knew the true me because they spent time with me. Mom walked me to the library and read me books, told me about books she read when she was young. Why not take walks with your parents? Talk to them while you\u2019re helping around the house? ",

            "answer_text": "Do you know your parents truly? You might say yes because you\u2019re exposed to their behaviours, opinions etc every day - but do you know what their hopes and dreams were at your age, or how they met and fell in love or what they write in texts to each other that you don\u2019t see? Don\u2019t you expose some of yourself in everyday behaviour, and keep some of yourself private like they do? What is it that you actually want them to know about you? Have you told them? Just sat down and talked? I think that many of us parents hold a kind of watching brief over kids in the process of becoming young adults. We know an awful lot about you already, and most of your essential personality and character. We don\u2019t know so much about other influences on you, like from your peers, teachers, people you admire who are your mentors (but we do know that some of these people can abuse your trust). Do you feel you have a giant secret that your parents should guess? I have a feeling this might be part of it? Please don\u2019t keep a secret from them if someone is exploiting you but you call it love. It always ends badly. ",
