            "answer_text": "Sorta\u2026 It\u2019s common to see smaller Kpop groups being more recognizable in Korea than other groups. Groups like The Boyz, Ateez, Exo, SNSD, and much more are very popular where I live. Bts and NCT are also commonly seen being advertised! IOI was very popular when they were promoting. Groups like Stray Kids have been another huge one. But as for popularity, I would say Kpop is more popular in places like the Philippines, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Germany, and the U.S. ",
