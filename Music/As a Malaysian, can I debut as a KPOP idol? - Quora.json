            "answer_text": "There is actually one person from Malaysia's 2nd biggest state which is Sabah! (the place where I was born)  His full name is Isaac Voo Kai Meng (\u90ac\u51ef\u540d).2. His birthday falls on 12th December 1994 and he was born in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. He\u2019s also the youngest in his family. 3. He studied at SJK (C) Chung Hwa Likas and SM Lok Yuk, where he was active in volleyball. 4. He became a top 4 finalist in the AlphaBAT audition in Malaysia when they were searching for its 10th member 5. This Sabahan lad actually quickly shot to fame after he participated in an idol survival programme called BOYS24. This programme commenced in August 2016 with 27 participating members who then began their series of concerts. They have reportedly completed 260 concerts since then. That\u2019s impressive! 6. He's in a boy group called IN2IT So can you debut as a kpop idol? Yes but you should never give up and you should learn how to persevere. Remember, you're competing against other people far more \u201cqualified\u201d such as the Koreans, Japanese, Chinese and the Thais. You're a Malaysian, flying overseas to Korea to work as an idol. You have to work harder than everybody else to be recognized. Learn Korean, study their culture and never slack off, since your place might be taken away. If you want to live as an idol just because you want to marry your oppa, but not because of your passion to sing, dance, or to compose then its meaningless. Living as one is hard and you have to prepare mentally and physically for it, especially if you are a Malaysian + came from a big company. You are prone to sasaeng fans, accidents (Wendy broke her pelvis and arms on the 25th of Dec during a rehearsal) and illness (GD was hyperventilating during Bigbang's concert). I'm not trying to scare you but these are the facts we all need to swallow. I am interested in becoming one too since I love dancing and my passion for music is indescribable (now I'm just making music by organising loops. Haven't use those advanced music programmes yet). The pressure from training could motivate me to do harder. The only two things that kinda stop me are money and the lack of bravery. So if you want to go for it, then do your best! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can. The first and foremost important thing is talent in these auditions.Looks don\u2019t matter much and nationality doesn\u2019t matter at all!If you are a good singer/rapper,dancer or good looking and even better if you are two or all three of these be sure to be selected! :) Be sure to be confident enough and just impress all CEO Oppa\u2019s.There even has been even an African-American; Alex in Rania(I\u2019ve heard there was someone even before her too but idk). Then you have Lisa from Thailand, not to mention the huge no.of Chinese and Japanese K-pop idols. I would suggest you not to fret over looks, if you are. Because they positively will work you up to the image they want to project. So if you are getting worked up over if you are fat, ugly, scars, skin colour idk anything!Just don\u2019t.Just keep working on talent and leave everything else to them <3 Of course you will have difficulties like language barrier and be prepared for tough schedule and also pressure and unsurity of success.But these are somethings you might face even if you were a Korean. So just give your all and i\u2019m sure everything will be great :D Hope you give auditions and pass them and then we have someone from Malaysia as well. <3. ",

Now, if you happen to try to sign into companies who think more about talent and attitude, as opposed to those who care more about looks, you might have a chance\u2014if you\u2019re talented and have a nice attitude. But, if you happen to try to sign into a company that cares more about looks, that\u2019s gonna be a bit tough. Unless, of course, you have Korean features and just overall look Korean. Then again, they\u2019ll know about the hate you could get just for being a foreigner. Which makes it even more tough. It\u2019s possible, but the possibility is really low. Unless of course, you pass for all the above. Don\u2019t lose hope and go get it! ",

As a realistic kpop observer(haha).Looks really means A LOT for an agency to recruit a foreigner esp as an http://idol.it doesnt matter if ure very pretty/handsome but u need to have the korean look or this appealing/attractive looks/charms that the koreans can accept(crazy pretty/handsome+fun)even shannon who is a half brits and half korean receive lots of hates just because she doesnt look like koreans.And i did hear one or two trainees from our country won some agency auditions few years ago and promised to get a debut(idk dun remember)and still not debuting.when actually their skills is quite good and even better than the average trainees from average agencies.but yeah age,looks,charms.those really matters.Ok im not trying to damp your spirit just sometimes we have to be realistic.If youre very sure of yourself.GO GIVE IT A SHOT.just enjoy the experience and dont get disappointed if you dont get the result that you expected.AJA!

But since Malaysia is 61% of Muslim (as in 2010) , the chance to be a trainee/Kpop idol is a little bit low because as you can see , Islam is strict with the clothing , foods , etc (especially for woman) . So , we all know that if you want to be a K-pop idol , you have to wear these updated modern trending clothing such as shorts , crop tops , and skirts something like that . But if you\u2019re Buddhism/Christian/Hinduism or any other else , it will not bother your chance to be an K-pop idol ! Fighting and do your best . ",

So if Singaporeans and Thais can be idols, I don\u2019t see why Malaysians can\u2019t. Of course it won\u2019t be easy as one will have to undergo years of training and have at least decent visuals, vocals, dance, Korean, etc. Also finding the company they want to train under and then auditioning into the company won\u2019t be easy. Honestly I don\u2019t understand why there have been no kpop idols from Malaysia as there are quite a number of Singers with great vocals and more than decent visuals. Maybe it\u2019s because they want to stay in their homeland with their families? Not too sure. But I won\u2019t be too surprised if a Malaysian born kpop idol appears in the next few years. Hope this answer helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been in Entertainment industry in Korea for some time now and I had lots and lots of people around me asking the similar questions. So here\u2019s some of the tips that I gave . First of all, what we gotta understand here is that Korean entertainment market is not as organized and developed as its size. Most do not hire through official recruiting process, but through personal connections (from one person\u2019s manager to another) However, dont lose hope! Wait for the recruitment post, constantly check out recruiting websites (\uc54c\ubc14\ubaac , its the recruiting websites with one of the most foot-traffic in Korea.) the website is not translatable. You can type (entertainment, \uc5d4\ud130\ud14c\uc778\uba3c\ud2b8 (=entertainment in Korean), or \ubc29\uc1a1\uad6d* (meaning broadcasting stations) (You might need someone to help you understand the job description) Broadcasting stations! are great place for you to lay a groundwork to dive into the entertainment industry. Looking for interns such as volunteers for audition tv show that hires worldwidely. You can definitely grow your network there. Being a foreigner with high passion and knowledge in the industry can be a big advantage you have! Have some professional skills in your quiver (such as Accounting or interpretation experience) (and you can get hired as an accountant or interpreter first!) Another way is (if you got nothing) to get a language teaching job near the company you wanna get in or in Seoul, and paying a visit to the companies and sending out cvs personally. (If you want to work in Korea, unless you teaching English for speaking classes, you better know how to speak on an intermediate level) I cannot promise anything, but I might still have some strings i may be able to pull. leave a comment.

Although bigger companies are less likely to accept foreigners, you still have a chance, and plus, there are always smaller companies. If your dream is to become a k-pop idol, then good luck! ",
