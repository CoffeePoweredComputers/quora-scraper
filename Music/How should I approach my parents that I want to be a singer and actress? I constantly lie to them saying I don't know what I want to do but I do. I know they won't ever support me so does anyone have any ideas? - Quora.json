            "answer_text": "This is what you do: aim for the practical job or career. For you practical job, train to be a cosmetologist or a bartender. Then when you move to your own room at eighteen years of age, take every dance, song, and acting class that you can. Then you can begin to go on tryouts for small parts. For example, if you get a part in a commercial, then you need to join Screen Actors\u2019 Guild. Now, if you prefer college, the same applies. Major in a very practical skill and then every course that is an elective, take dancing class, acting class, and singing classes. Then you can get your minor in acting. From my town, there was a girl Laurie Jay Miller who got a part in a situational comedy on television. She began by doing dinner theater. So, in your town, try out for every play. Laurie is now an entertainment lawyer in the Los Angeles area. One more thing, there was once a man on a talk show who came on and told the audience that he never let his cab license expire, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust this acting thing,\u201d and the audience clapped. You must have a practical Plan B. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Stick to high school and community theater. If you don't own you can't do it. If you really have a talent, passion, drive and dedication and get lucky you might find work. Wheather or not that is a career only time will tell. There is a difference between working and supporting yourself and being a star. Thousands of young hopefulls head to NY and Hollywood every year who are just as talented ,good looking and have a drive. Many end up failing and falling. Have a plan, have a back up plan, learn the craft. ",
