            "answer_text": "Africa does not have one monolithic culture. Here is a link to a brief introduction about Africa.  What I can say is that, looking at African Culture with a Pan African perspective, there are cross-cutting ways of life of the people on the continent. Traditionally, they passed on knowledge to the younger generation through folklore, music, dance, specialized trainings like blacksmiths, midwives, surgeons etc. That is a cultural component that has been lost in much of the continent. Traditional Knowledge and Africa's History of Innovation Then there is the whole relationship between the north and sub saharan africa, that many are not aware of. The Berber migration spread their cultural influence to south of the Sahara Relationship between the Northern and Sub Saharan African Cultures Also, many societies in africa, lived in harmony with nature that provided them with food, medicine, crafts, clothing et al. African Communities Living in Harmony with Nature I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Gotta smile at that one.\"African culture\" meaning what exactly? Africa has thousands of ethnicities and languages, each with their own culture and customs, so you might have to be a bit more specific.My suggestion would be - select an African country, do a little reading, and suddenly you'll see which groups and communities make up the country's cultural fabric, and what those cultures are likely to be like.
