It must suck to have the ideology that \u2018nothing matters\u2019 because I think you might be missing the point. Life is meaningless without purpose. Finding that purpose is what one must do in order to feel fulfilled (I mean true purpose not just making a bunch of money and hating your job.) Your question of \u2018Whats the point?\u2019 is not something that anyone can answer but you! Sure, one could look at the facts and how insignificant we are, just become a number, and die, but whats the fun in that? Too many people forget that when it really comes down to it, not many people care whether you have a good life or not, you have to do it for you! Live full, die empty. I hope this guides you in some way. -Daniel ",
