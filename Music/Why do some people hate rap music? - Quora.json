            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t just tell you why others hate it, but i\u2019ll tell you why i hate it to. 1. Bad influence. I\u2019m still in high school, and the majority of the kids who listen to rap here do nothing but come in throwing their gang signs, talking about smoking weed, cursing, and rapping very foul lyrics. I find that they also develop bad attitudes. Yes, a mouthy child can be anyone who wasn\u2019t raised right, or was just spoiled, but rap influences youth to be twice as bad. Some of them argue with adults and they act like they are adults themselves when their immaturity shows otherwise. 2. Very inappropriate music videos and lyrics. Every day i come into school, i see nothing but obnoxious kids walking around with their pants hanging off their butt\u2019s, covered in gold jewelry, and then i realize that\u2019s exactly how these rappers dress in their music videos. And their lyrics influence them as well. I always got to hear these brats say something stupid like \u201cthug life\u201d or \u201c2 Chainz\u201d or \u201csmoke Weed everyday\u201d or \u201c420\u201d. These kids are obsessed with drugs, sex , money, they take no responsibility. The next generation is doomed. 3. It is just plain garbage. all they do is sing about the following -Weed -Money -Girls -Asses -Guns which is actually hypocritical, because most rappers are bleeding heart liberals who support gun control, yet they love to rap about shooting up places. 4. Negative role models. The kids here also think very highly of themselves. They think they can do anything, and beat anyone. They are so full of themselves, they think they can take on gangs by themselves. Rap definitely has influenced this. I gave it a listen before. The song i don\u2019t know, because i barely could understand what he was saying. But i remember part of the lyrics. Not word for word, but it was in the lines of i\u2019m better than everyone, can\u2019t no one take me, i\u2019m so strong, blah blah, and i know for a fact other rap songs encourage this sort of behavior. EDIT: So i have encountered quite a few people in the comments who clearly do not like an opposing opinion on a trend. Well, That\u2019s your problem. The individuals comments were deleted, because they wanted nothing but trouble. I\u2019d proudly argue with them, except i\u2019d get flagged for violation of community guidelines. Anyway, point is, these people were rather hostile, and obviously listen to rap. This only proves my point further. Listeners of this type of music usually have a rather aggressive attitude, as they did. I don\u2019t like your music, get over yourself. I\u2019m simply answering the question, sharing my opinion, while pointing out facts. ",

            "answer_text": "Because rap is hedonistic, narcissistic, misogynistic and worst of all violent. Whatever happened to classy black groups like The Temptations, The Isley Brothers, and The Four Tops? You are only cool if you listen to hard, gangster rap and have that facade of angry, criminal activity and swag. I don't think I have ever heard a rap song that doesn't involve guns and making \u201cpop pop pop\u201d or \u201cb-d-d-d-d-d\u201d vocalizations imitating guns. It's also hard to find a rap song that doesn't glorify drug abuse, like \u201cmolly\u201d, cocaine, \u201clean\u201d and other codeines. Could rap possibly have something to do with the higher rate of crime seen in the black community? The higher rate of incarceration and drug abuse? Cardi B\u2019s song \u201cI like it like that\u201d is ALL about guns, gangs and gang violence, to name just one example. Look at the lyrics. Now look at all the followers of Cardi B on twitter, these are people that aspire to be like her. We are literally talking about a skank stripper here with no upward mobility in society, saved by rap to become an icon. While driving, I see people that walk down the sidewalk with their pants below their ass, waving their hands rapping to themselves ALL THE TIME. I frequently work in Macon, Ga for reference, where the black population here is 2/3 black, or 66%. People that are empathetic to the black cause generally have no idea what it is like to live in an area that is majority black, these \u201cSJWs\u201d live in majority white areas. Now the inner cities like Detroit and Ferguson and Birmingham are festering, and I find myself missing the classy black people that made up The Supremes, The Temptations and Otis Redding. ",
