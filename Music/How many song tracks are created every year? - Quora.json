            "answer_text": "That is a very large number of songs... there are many famous artists that make songs which arent put in any records, dome release singles that aren't famous. There are the people who aren't as widely known as pop musicians who still make loads of music. So this number is undefined. Unless you're in some freakish worldwide song monitoring agency that counts songs (probably doesnt exist, I mean how this benifit anyone??!). Thus your question is probably not gonna be answered any time soon and your argument is anyway INVALID. ",

More than 1 million songs are released annually (not sure if that number is just North America or global, but needless to say, there are more songs than anyone can ever listen to in a lifetime if they did nothing else. No wonder it is so difficult to make a living in the music space. ",
