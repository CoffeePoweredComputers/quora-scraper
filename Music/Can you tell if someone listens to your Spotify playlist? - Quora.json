            "answer_text": "No. As for today (Feb 2020), and according to my knowledge, it isn\u2019t possible for the usual user to know exactly WHO streamed a particular Spotify playlist. Curators might get to know how many people played it, using tools such as chartmetric. Of course, Spotify knows very precisely who listened what. So they can re-orientate their own strategy, for instance, and suggest users music that possibly will meet their tastes. Juan Maria Solare ",

However, you can look at exactly who is following your account, to try and gauge who may be following your playlists. 1. Open the Spotify app on your iPhone or Android device. 2. Tap the gear icon in the top-right corner of your screen.  3. Select \"View Profile\" at the top. 4. Tap the \"FOLLOWERS\" tab to view who's following your profile. ",
