            "answer_text": "While you\u2019re leaving out some critical information (your computer/device platform), most music services (iTunes, etc) automatically include the front cover as part of the download. In fact if you add music to your iTunes collection that doesn\u2019t have cover art but has metadata that includes the album name, iTunes will try to find it and update your library with it. If you\u2019re looking for a third party service to find more than just the front cover, I\u2019d suggest www.discogs.com. Not only do they have data covering almost every album (LP) that I\u2019ve ever owned, they often have front cover, back cover, liner notes and scans of the round label in the middle of the record. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend visiting 4shared site. They have various albums with album arts shared by different accounts. Not all albums can\u2019t be found in site. But mostly, or if you are lucky, they are in the ZIP or RAR files. But before downloading files, what I have remembered is you need to make an account. Not necessarily to purchase some apps license or to buy premium accounts. You can sign up eventually with your Facebook or Google account by clicking logging via social media.  -Not in a 4shared team or whatever ",
