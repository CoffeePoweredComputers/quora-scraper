            "answer_text": "There are many softwares and apps for composing music. If you are planning to do it on your phone, please make sure your phone has a RAM of at least 4\u20136 GB for smooth working. I would recommend you to use SoundTrap, you can easily find in the app store/ Google play store. This one is good for beginners and has an easy-to-use interface. Also, It has some In-built tunes and sound effects. This app offers you a free-trial version of upto some tracks but you have to pay to use it further. You can also try MUSIC MAKER JAM, I have not used this but heard of it and its pretty good for beginners but a bit limited. If you are going to use your Desktop/Laptop you need to have a Digital Audio Workstation, I would recommend FL STUDIO, It is a very nice software and you can get numerous YouTube videos and tutorials on how to use it but this also has a trial version and then you need to pay for it.
