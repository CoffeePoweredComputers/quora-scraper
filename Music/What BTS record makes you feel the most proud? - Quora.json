They were even on top of famous americans singer and as a part of a fanbase president in my country seeing all out efforts pay off is the most beautiful thing that could happen \ud83d\udc95 Obviously I was also so happy and proud of the members who always work hard and do their best for us. Hearing how they cried and how happy Jungkook was since it was his birthday was so cute. I hope they will win more awards soon and a Grammy award soon. I really love them and I am proud of everything they achieved. Thank you for reading, stream Dynamite and have a good day \ud83d\udc9c ",
