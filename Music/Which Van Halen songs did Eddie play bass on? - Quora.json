            "answer_text": "On the VH3 album, Eddie played bass on all of the album except for 2 songs. He also played bass on the 3 additional previously unreleased tracks for the Best Of Both Worlds greatest hits album. I\u2019ve heard various rumors about Eddie playing bass on various other songs over the decades. If there\u2019s any truth to it, it was easiest for Eddie to probably do it when he recorded most of the albums in his home based 5150 studio starting with Van Halen\u2019s album 1984. ",
