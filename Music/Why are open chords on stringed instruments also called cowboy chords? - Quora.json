            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t pay these others much mind. They\u2019re trying to sugarcoat the truth\u2026which is that when someone uses the phrase \u201ccowboy chords\u201d for open chords, they mean it derisively. It is/was used by jazz guitarists, who \u201cback in the day\u201d, never used open chord fingerings, and, actually, hardly ever even used major and minor chords that hadn\u2019t been either altered or extended (and they didn\u2019t like fifths much, either). If you were playing cowboy chords, it meant that you couldn\u2019t cut the music. My guitar mentor was a solid jazz player, and tended to call them \u201cbaby chords\u201d. He didn\u2019t like to see them. This actually makes sense, for a number of reasons. For one thing, jazz guitarists play a lot of rhythm accompaniment, which needs to be fairly staccato. Those ringy open chords don\u2019t work very well. For another thing, they tend to play in keys like Bb, F, and Eb, and arrangements often include key changes. If you capo up, they smirk. The last reason is the real killer, which is the idea that you should move thru chord changes by half steps whenever possible. Try doing that with baby chords. This is really a very narrow view, though. Blues and various country music styles are built around the open chord sounds, and involve playing single note leads and bass lines against open strings. There\u2019s often a bit of fingerpicking , too That\u2019s featured a lot in today\u2019s music, so if you only play closed position chords, you can\u2019t cut the music. Before I go, here\u2019s an entertaining personal experience. Once, I was working a High School Prom, and for the Prom King and Queen\u2019s dance, the school choir\u2019s Prima Donna (it\u2019s not a put down, it\u2019s what you call the main female singer in a performing group) came out to sing a rather operatic version of \u201cFire and Rain\u201d, accompanied by a Dixieland-style jazz guitarist. I\u2019ll leave the rest for you to ponder. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! I have haven\u2019t had that request so far but the tradition of the cowboy chords is the stuff of legend. Cowboy chords are mainly triads and they are played by beginners to get started. The cowboy part is the tradition of the western guitar players and singers of the high lonesome territories. Cowboy chords are simple to play and are usually played in the open position. The chords and melodies are simple and the easy pace of the cowboy chords makes for a relaxing and enjoyable experience for both the player and the audience. (The horse, dog, the occasional coyote, and the occasional guest at the campfire.) The heartfelt stories and exciting ballads provided a means of entertainment. The popularity of the cowboy way has exploded through the decades and as we all know, western/cowboy/country is here to stay. C\u2019mon, the cowboy wrote the lyrics \"If you won't leave me, I'll find a woman who will!\" spoke volumes in that song. Who else could have pulled that one-off? I think it was written by Guitar Junior Brown. If you can find it online, give it a listen. I am a guitarist and no matter what kind of hellfire and brimstone music I create, it doesn\u2019t budge the cowboy way. I have been slow to experience the music that is heartfelt, humorous, and emotional. What got me the most is that many country players look like they could uproot a tree with their bare hands and still sing and play music from the heart in that high lonesome way. 12/4/2019 insert. I have known many country/cowboy guitar players. There are pickers that fly like lightning, others just have a story to tell. The cowboy chords often stand back to let the story speak. It\u2019s the cowboy way! P.S. The tradition of their music transcends many variations but with the unified style of the cowboy way. Cowboys and cowgirls too! The cowgirl performers are a force of their own. I didn\u2019t want to leave them out. Thank you for the great question! ",
