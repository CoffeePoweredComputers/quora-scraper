            "answer_text": "I don't hate Rock and metal music far from it l but I did absolutely HATE , loathe and detest Rock N Roll . Too me Rock N Roll is that really cheesey and pathetically corny shit from the late 50's and early 60s that Teenagers of that time listened to but old people of today love . I wouldn\u2019t mind if they accepted that it was a nostalgic thing and that it started a massive revolution changing the way teens and adults dressed and gave them a way of thinking and a fashion of their own I hate it with a passion when they tell me I\u2019m too old for grunge or pop punk music fashion when a fair few of these the ones who come out with this hypocritical bullshit about longing for a time when there was no such thing as teenagers seem to be forgetting that it was their generation that changed it all for many future generations to come and so I\u2019d sarcastically thank them for creating a whole new culture , I do despise Artists such as Elvis Presley , Buddy Holly , Eddie Cochran and many more hip shaking teddy boys of that era but I will say that I respect what they did for popular music as I love Rock , Metal , Punk Rock , Grunge , Classic Rock & Progressive Rock but I feel embarrassed for it to be associated with that other shit so yes I do hate Rock N Roll and many people will think I hate all Rock music unless I take the time to explain the difference between the two. The songs were just so fucking simple and purile. I do understand that it gave birth to teenage culture because at the time society was just getting over the aftermath of the second world war and all the effects of it and the teens at the time started to do the kind of things and dress their own way and fashion as we know it today was born . If you go back to WW2 you\u2019ll see that EVEN pre teens of that thankfully bygone era who were basically children and teens that were expected to dress and behave in exactly the same way as adults so they were like mini adults and they were expected to be leaving school at 14 , going straight into work and were dressed in a similar way to their parents and they modelled themselves on other adults rather than their peers and so went straight into a dead end job like their parents and bought money home into the family and were ready to leave home before age 20 , they got married and would have children of their own , basically they were repeating the same cycle as their parents but in the mid 1950\u2019s that all changed and a new artist was first seen on the Ed Sullivan show , he had his hair in a quiff and he was wiggling his hips in a very suggestive manner , the adults at the time did NOT approve one bit and called it smut and filth , they confiscated their teenage sons / daughters records by this new groundbreaking artist and that new artist was Called Elvis Presley. Even though I am not a fan of that whole teddy boy movement I feel like I have gotta respect it and appreciate it for what it did , if only for it separating adults and teenagers from each other because if that didn\u2019t happen We\u2019d have had no other of the teenage cultures we have had in the last 60 years , there\u2019d have been no Beatles , Rolling Stones , No prog Rock , No Punk , No Metal , No Grunge and no alternative Pop punk so I\u2019d be typing this out while wearing a suit with a cardigan and slippers as I wouldn\u2019t own much other clothing or maybe I would\u2019ve had to get creative as that may have been my only option since suits and old mans cardigans were the only garments available before that time . Thanks to that new movement it did pave the way for teenagers and young adults of today to earn their own money and spend it how they chose to on whatever they wanted and also to create their own identity. As teenagers they had only just started meeting up with friends . A whole new bunch of new establishments were created with just young people in mind such as fast food burger joints with a jukebox with a extensive record selection of 45\u2019s which would ultimately provide the soundtrack to their evening , Drive in cinema\u2019s where they would be able to watch the latest blockbuster on a big screen from their car , Ten Pin Bowling Alleys there\u2019d be discos playing them the latest hits of the day and so this is why I Can\u2019t hold onto my past hate towards 1950\u2019s - early 60\u2019s rock N Roll , it really was such a game changer and totally broke teen and adult culture away from each other so this is why baby boomers are still listening to Elvis Presley and similar artists of that time with such fond memories because it is mainly all down to nostalgia for them and it reminds them of when they were young and free it still reminds them of their adolescent days so that's always the comeback I give to them when they remind me that I'm an adult and I'm too old to still be listening to pop punk as It's very juvenile the songs and the whole culture of the genre I am just more than happy to remind them of their own cheesey 50's rock n roll music of their time and even though It's simplistic , and it has juvenile lyrics and fashion I am now at an age myself where I can appreciate it for what is is and that in terms of teen fashions it is in fact no different now that a lot of time has passed since the whole pop punk / Nu metal phase of the late 90\u2019s - early 2000\u2019s and the fact that I am an adult myself , I do prefer not to get into conversation about this with such dumb inbred brain-rotters so I have avoided hanging out in places where such thick imbeciles regularly frequent such as coffee mornings at local community centres .

            "answer_text": "Hate is a really tricky word. You don\u2019t hate just like that. Somebody or something must do something really bad to you to start hating it. For example, I hate dentists. Not as people, not as profession, but the pain of having my teeth fixed is worse than having a hand bone broken (I had both). Everybody has their preferences. There are people who enjoy different things, like cars, music, gaming, reading, movies, and the list goes on and on. So I believe if somebody can\u2019t stand that specific type of music, it\u2019s just because they don\u2019t find pleasure in it. I prefer Rap and Nu/Heavy Metal music. I also like Jazz and Blues, but I have no interest in modern mainstream music like Pop. I just don\u2019t see anything good in it. Also, in my country we have so called Folk music (it could compare to American Country music). That\u2019s the genre on the bottom of my list. The same goes for car type of people, some like American muscle, some prefer European, or Asian cars. Also for books, games, movies, so yeah, I believe you just don\u2019t hate Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, you just don\u2019t like it. ",
