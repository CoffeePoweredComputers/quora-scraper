            "answer_text": "I still remember when I first heard the song by Peter Gabriel, \u201cSolsbury Hill.\u201d Something about that song\u2014the lyrics, the melody, the unusual 7/4 time signature\u2014gave me chills. Even now, years later, it still can make me cry. Who among us doesn\u2019t have a similar story about a song that touched us? Whether attending a concert, listening to the radio, or singing in the shower, there\u2019s something about music that can fill us with emotion, from joy to sadness. Music impacts us in ways that other sounds don\u2019t, and for years now, scientists have been wondering why. Now they are finally beginning to find some answers. Using fMRI technology, they\u2019re discovering why music can inspire such strong feelings and bind us so tightly to other people \u201cMusic affects deep emotional centers in the brain, \u201c says Valorie Salimpoor, a neuroscientist at McGill University who studies the brain on music. \u201cA single sound tone is not really pleasurable in itself; but if these sounds are organized over time in some sort of arrangement, it\u2019s amazingly powerful.\u201d How music makes the brain happy How powerful? In one of her studies, she and her colleagues hooked up participants to an fMRI machine and recorded their brain activity as they listened to a favorite piece of music. During peak emotional moments in the songs identified by the listeners, dopamine was released in the nucleus accumbens, a structure deep within the older part of our human brain. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal, because dopamine is released with biological rewards, like eating and sex, for example,\u201d says Salimpoor. \u201cIt\u2019s also released with drugs that are very powerful and addictive, like cocaine or8 amphetamines.\u201d There\u2019s another part of the brain that seeps dopamine, specifically just before those peak emotional moments in a song: the caudate nucleus, which is involved in the anticipation of pleasure. Presumably, the anticipatory pleasure comes from familiarity with the song\u2014you have a memory of the song you enjoyed in the past embedded in your brain, and you anticipate the high points that are coming. This pairing of anticipation and pleasure is a potent combination, one that suggests we are biologically-driven to listen to music we like. But what happens in our brains when we like something we haven\u2019t heard before? To find out, Salimpoor again hooked up people to fMRI machines. But this time she had participants listen to unfamiliar songs, and she gave them some money, instructing them to spend it on any music they liked. When analyzing the brain scans of the participants, she found that when they enjoyed a new song enough to buy it, dopamine was again released in the nucleus accumbens. But, she also found increased interaction between the nucleus accumbens and higher, cortical structures of the brain involved in pattern recognition, musical memory, and emotional processing. This finding suggested to her that when people listen to unfamiliar music, their brains process the sounds through memory circuits, searching for recognizable patterns to help them make predictions about where the song is heading. If music is too foreign-sounding, it will be hard to anticipate the song\u2019s structure, and people won\u2019t like it\u2014meaning, no dopamine hit. But, if the music has some recognizable features\u2014maybe a familiar beat or melodic structure\u2014people will more likely be able to anticipate the song\u2019s emotional peaks and enjoy it more. The dopamine hit comes from having their predictions confirmed\u2014or violated slightly, in intriguing ways. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a roller coaster ride,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere you know what\u2019s going to happen, but you can still be pleasantly surprised and enjoy it.\u201d Salimpoor believes this combination of anticipation and intense emotional release may explain why people love music so much, yet have such diverse tastes in music\u2014one\u2019s taste in music is dependent on the variety of musical sounds and patterns heard and stored in the brain over the course of a lifetime. It\u2019s why pop songs are, well, popular\u2014their melodic structures and rhythms are fairly predictable, even when the song is unfamiliar\u2014and why jazz, with its complicated melodies and rhythms, is more an acquired taste. On the other hand, people tend to tire of pop music more readily than they do of jazz, for the same reason\u2014it can become too predictable. Her findings also explain why people can hear the same song over and over again and still enjoy it. The emotional hit off of a familiar piece of music can be so intense, in fact, that it\u2019s easily re-stimulated even years later. \u201cIf I asked you to tell me a memory from high school, you would be able to tell me a memory,\u201d says Salimpoor. \u201cBut, if you listened to a piece of music from high school, you would actually feel the emotions.\u201d How music synchronizes brains Ed Large, a music psychologist at the University of Connecticut, agrees that music releases powerful emotions. His studies look at how variations in the dynamics of music\u2014slowing down or speeding up of rhythm, or softer and louder sounds within a piece, for example\u2014resonate in the brain, affecting one\u2019s enjoyment and emotional response. In one study, Large and colleagues had participants listen to one of two variations on a Chopin piece: In version one, the piece was played as it normally is, with dynamic variations, while in version two, the piece was played mechanically, without these variations. When the participants listened to the two versions while hooked up to an fMRI machine, their pleasure centers lit up during dynamic moments in the version one song, but didn\u2019t light up in version two. It was as if the song had lost its emotional resonance when it lost its dynamics, even though the \u201cmelody\u201d was the same. When playing the more dynamic version, Large also observed activity in the listener\u2019s mirror neurons \u2014the neurons implicated in our ability to experience internally what we observe externally. The neurons fired more slowly with slower tempos, and faster with faster tempos, suggesting that mirror neurons may play an important role in processing musical dynamics and affecting how we experience music. \u201cMusical rhythms can directly affect your brain rhythms, and brain rhythms are responsible for how you feel at any given moment,\u201d says Large. That\u2019s why when people get together and hear the same music\u2014such as in a concert hall\u2014it tends to make their brains synch up in rhythmic ways, inducing a shared emotional experience, he says. Music works in much the same way language works\u2014using a combination of sound and dynamic variations to impart a certain understanding in the listener. \u201cIf I\u2019m a performer and you\u2019re a listener, and what I\u2019m playing really moves you, I\u2019ve basically synchronized your brain rhythm with mine,\u201d says Large. \u201cThat\u2019s how I communicate with you.\u201d Different notes for different folks Other research on music supports Large\u2019s theories. In one study, neuroscientists introduced different styles of songs to people and monitored brain activity. They found that music impacts many centers of the brain simultaneously; but, somewhat surprisingly, each style of music made its own pattern, with uptempo songs creating one kind of pattern, slower songs creating another, lyrical songs creating another, and so on. Even if people didn\u2019t like the songs or didn\u2019t have a lot of musical expertise, their brains still looked surprisingly similar to the brains of people who did. But if our brains all synch up when we hear the same basic dynamic differences in music, why don\u2019t we all respond with the same pleasure? Large, like Salimpoor, says that this difference in preference is due to how our neurons are wired together, which in turn is based on our own, personal history of listening to or performing music. Rhythm is all about predictability, he says, and our predictions about music start forming from a pretty early age onward. He points to the work of Erin Hannon at the University of Nevada who found that babies as young as 8 months old already tune into the rhythms of the music from their own cultural So while activity in the nucleus accumbens may signal emotional pleasure, it doesn\u2019t explain it, says Large. Learning does. That\u2019s why musicians\u2014who\u2019ve usually been exposed to more complicated musical patterns over time\u2014tend to have more varied musical tastes and enjoy more avant-garde musical traditions than non-musicians. Social contexts are also important, he adds, and can affect your emotional responses.. \u201cLiking is so subjective,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic may not sound any different to you than to someone else, but you learn to associate it with something you like and you\u2019ll experience a pleasure response.\u201d Perhaps that explains why I love \u201cSolsbury Hill\u201d so much. Not only does its unusual rhythm intrigue me\u2014as a musician, I still have the urge to count it out from time to time\u2014but it reminds me of where I was when I first heard the song: sitting next to a cute guy I had a crush on in college. No doubt my anticipatory pleasure centers were firing away for a multitude of reasons. And, luckily, now that the pleasure pathways are now deeply embedded in my brain, the song can keep on giving that sweet emotional release. ",

            "answer_text": "I imagine it is different for everyone. For me it has a lot to do with what music can convey without words, or convey what words cannot. It is like speaking in \u2018emotions\u2019 to me. I've never listened to music that has failed to give me an emotional response. Even if that response is disgust. Even then though, there is value in that. Music can still tell stories without the presence of words while also giving emotional responses to people. It can be purely emotional or purely cerebral as well. It can give us energy. Think of people that listen to music while they run or exercise. Music can be like a time capsule too. Listening to music from my youth often times floods my senses with nastolgia and it is a surreal experience. Nothing else does that to me. Overall it is kind of a mystery. Personal to everyone in different ways. Therefore inspirational to everyone in different ways. Why? I have no clue. That may be something only the individual can answer on their. Something everyone would have their own answer to and not any one person would be wrong. I've met people, though few of them, that have no connection to music what-so-ever. So clearly for them, at least from my point of view, music has no inspirational value at all. ",
