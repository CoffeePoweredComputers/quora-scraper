They have this one song, where after the heavily distorted guitars, the singer, Dave \"Spinach\" Malinksky, nearly blows out the mic, screaming \u201cONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU, ONLY WANNA PEE WITH YOU\u2026\u201d I truly can\u2019t stop repeating this song on my bus commute from Orlando to Tampa, though I think my bus-mates are getting a little annoyed from hearing the Ass\u00fcck leaking through my speakers. Cheers, Rob. ",
