            "answer_text": "I don't remember their names, but the record industry was afraid to use MP3. They feared that their official files would show up on the file-sharing networks. So, they wouldn't offer digital files without DRM (Digital Rights Manangement, copy-protection). The only choice before iTunes Store was WMA (Windows Media Audio) and few MP3-players supported it. iPod specifically did not support it. The record industry also thought that the digital file was a better product (you didn't have to go to a physical store or wait for the delivery of a CD and then rip it) so the WMA file was more expensive compared to the CD. Not only were the file-sharing networks cheaper, they were also easier to use, no restrictions on the files and higher sound quality. Why would anyone want to buy the WMA files? So, hardly anyone did, and the file-sharing networks became very popular since they were the only practical way to download music. iTunes changed a lot ot this. They still used DRM in the beginning, so you could only play the music on Apple software, and only on five devices. But it was possible to circumvent the restrictions by recording a CD. Apple also decided that the price had to be 99 cents per song. Most of the labels and artists agreed eventually, but not everyone. ",
