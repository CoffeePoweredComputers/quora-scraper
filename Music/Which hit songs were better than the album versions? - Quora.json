            "answer_text": "\u201cWhich hit songs were better than the album versions?\u201d The first song that comes to mind for me is Cheap Trick\u2019s \u201cI Want You to Want Me\u201d. Originally from their second album \u201cIn Color\u201d, it was the first single from but completely failed to chart in the U.S.. It did, however, do well in Japan which led to a tour there where their live album \u201cCheap Trick at Budokan\u201d was recorded. That version became a massive hit int the U.S. and catapulted them to stardom. Although they\u2019re the same song, the two versions are completely different. The original version is more directly upbeat and relies much more on piano. There\u2019s no piano on the live version, and it\u2019s a much more powerful version done by a band at the height of their skills. Rick Nielsen\u2019s guitar parts on the original seem almost phoned-in, whereas they\u2019re brilliant and burning on the live album. Don\u2019t just take what I say as truth though, listen to them for yourself! ",
