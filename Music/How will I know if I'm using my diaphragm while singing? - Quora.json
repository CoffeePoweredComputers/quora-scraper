            "answer_text": "There are some great suggestions on this page so I will just add my two cents to this topic. Your diaphragm is working every time you take a breath. It\u2019s working non-stop 24/7. It descends a few centimeters every time you inhale, whether you sleep, talk or sing. However, in singing you want to create conditions in your body, during which your diaphragm descends more than a few centimeters. You want your diaphragm to work most efficiently. So, your question should be more like: How will I know if I am using my diaphragm efficiently while singing? You can do that by observing your body. There are 3 easy signs to tell if your diaphragm is working as it should: Proper body alignment: your diaphragm can work most efficiently when your torso is well aligned. In a collapsed or closed body, the diaphragm simply does not have space to move efficiently.Expansion in all directions during inhalation: your diaphragm can work most efficiently when your torso expands sideways, forward and backward during inhalation. The most breathing movement should be observed in the lower half of the body. If the torso expands in all directions, your diaphragm can descend fully.Maintaining expansion during exhalation or singing: your diaphragm wants to return to its relaxed position during exhalation, so a singer needs to slow down this upward movement. You do it by engaging other muscles by keeping the torso expanded. If your torso looses expansion quickly, your diaphragm will also ascend quickly and you will run out of breath before finishing a sung phrase.I made a video, in which I am going more in depth into this topic and I also demonstrate two breathing exercises to practice these three concepts. You can watch it, if you are interested:  ",

            "answer_text": "If you are living, you are using your diaphragm - even a baby uses this muscle to breathe. The diaphragm works all the time for inhaling and exhaling, even when we sleep. For singing, the good singer becomes aware of the abdominal and rib muscles. When a good singer engages these other muscles, then the energy of BREATH becomes better, and the sound quality and pitch are better too. To really learn these skills, get an experienced teacher who has academic credentials. Until then, see the practice ideas below. Good luck! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ABCs of Singing There\u2019s an easy way to think about voice culture: the ABCs of Singing. The same things apply to the speaking voice. A is for Alignment. For singing, stand with feet a few cm. apart, NOT exactly parallel, with weight slightly forward on the balls of the feet. Feel a sense of energy in your feet and legs. Keep knees flexible, not tight. Raise your hands far, far above your head, and then allow them to descend and rest easily at your sides. Let your back be straight. Imagine there is a silver thread from the base of your spine out the top of your head that allows your body to float up, up, up. Allow the ribs to expand like an opening umbrella. It is never static or tight, but flexible and dynamic. As you practice, come back to these points, and refresh your alignment/posture. B is for Breathing. Exercise: \u201cBreathe through a straw,\u201d inhale through puckered lips. Immediately hiss out LOUDLY, with great energy from the middle of the body (abdominal area). Feel how this increases energy in the breath. Maintain alignment - don\u2019t allow the upper body to collapse as you exhale. Return to this exercise a few times as you practice. As you sing, breathe LOW in the body, and imagine you have a tire inner tube around your middle; fill it up and lean into it. Always think \u201cup.\u201d C is for Coordination. Importantly, as you go higher, let the voice get lighter and brighter - don\u2019t use a lot of pressure. But, allow the ribs to rise a little, and allow the energy from the middle of the body to increase a little. Don\u2019t yell or scream - instead, slightly increase breath energy and expand your posture to make the sound a little higher or louder. Exercise: easily repeat one note with a breath between then sustain and crescendo diminuendo - get louder and softer [ a, a, a, a\u2014\u2014\u2014- ] . Repeat the exercise on different vowels and higher note, several times. As you go higher, let the voice feel lighter and brighter. This is a very basic start. To really improve your singing voice, get a teacher with academic credentials in voice teaching. ",
