            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request. I will try to explain Body piercings for both the genders : Men: Piercings of any type are Haram (forbidden) on Men, as adornment by jewellery is only allowed for women. And piercings will be a sort of \u201cimitating\u201d women. So no piercings for men. Women: Piercings for women are allowed, on places like ears and nose, to wear jewellery, As gold and adornment are allowed for women. Ear piercings can be proved by many events from the life of the prophet, and that wives of the Propher (P.B.U.H.) and the female sahabiat used to wear ear rings. But these should only be shown to her husband, or other mahrams. The intention should not be to imitate Kuffars and other people, rather it should be to adorn herself. In many cultures, nose piercings are also a custom, and as there are no adverse effects of it on human helath, and it is in a place where a mahram can see, It is permissible. Piercings on tongue is forbidden, for the harmful effects it causes to the human health and body. Piercings on stomach and private parts are also forbidden, as it includes the uncovering of private parts in front of non-mahrams and strangers, and it is better not to have piercing there. If any other body piercings are a custom in the society, and it doesnt cause any harm to the body, doesnt include uncovering of private parts and \u201cawrah\u201d, and that the custom is not prevalent among the evildoers and sinners, (like prostituites and dancers etc.) then there is no harm in doing it. Proof from Hadith and more reasons given at the following sites: Detailed ruling on body piercing Tongue piercing - islamqa.info Ruling on piercing women\u2019s ears Hope I helped :)! ",

            "answer_text": "I am not an expert on Jurisprudence but I might have an idea why piercings are not allowed for men in Islam. All I can say, that in Islam piercings are considered something for women and men who do that are imitating women (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621). Men imitating women in Islam is forbidden. Is there a logical reason behind it? No. In my opinion, if you want to have piercings, then go for it. God won\u2019t be offended by you wearing piercings. If that god is concerned with what you wear and how you go to the toilet, then he/she is not a god, and he/she doesn\u2019t deserve your worship. ",
