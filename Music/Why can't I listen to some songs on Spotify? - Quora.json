            "answer_text": "Sometimes you might come across songs that are unplayable. There are 2 good reasons why you can't play them. The license certificate of the song which is unplayable might have expired or Spotify doesn't have permission from the publishing music authority to stream that particular song even if it shows up on your playlist.You might be using a VPN to access Spotify to bypass regions. Such method also prevents you from listening to some tracks which are specifically made available to a particular region. You may disconnect your VPN and try once more. If it works well and good but if it doesn't then you gotta skip it.I guess that sums it up. Please upvote if you like it. Cheers!! Happy streaming. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if you mean a listed song doesn\u2019t work when you try to play it, or why certain songs just aren\u2019t there. I will assume the latter. Artists do make a pittance from Spotify. It varies, but somewhere around .07 of a US $0.01 per stream, which means you need a LOT of streams to get paid anything at all. Some big current artists choose not to have their material on Spotify because they believe that mass streaming makes people in general less likely to buy the tracks. And then many artists feel the opposite, i.e. that if they can get on a big Spotify playlist it will expose their work to more people and increase their sales. It very much depends on the artist. I know quite a few smallish indie artists who put out indie recordings in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. Unless they take specific steps to distribute their older material on Spotify, it will not appear there, and some simply don\u2019t want to bother. Dead artists such as Ella Fitzgerald do appear on Spotify because their legacy was left in care of some management company who wanted people to continue to hear it, and they can still get the streaming income from it.
