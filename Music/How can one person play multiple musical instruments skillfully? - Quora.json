            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve performed publicly on over 120 different instruments. I started on just one instrument, clarinet, and that led with little issue to saxophone\u2014similar embouchere, similar fingerings. Flute followed. Then I spent some time learning mandolin. Going through my bachelor of music program I took classes in woodwinds, brass, percussion and piano, and I did perform a little on trumpet, French horn, and keys but eventually decided I needed to limit myself a little, so I decided only woodwinds, percussion, vocal, and plucked or bowed strings with no more than 10 steings on the instrument. Even at that sometimes it would take me an hour to tune up everything. I found I needed to practice switching from one instrument to another so I could do it seamlessly in mid-song if I wanted. I also had to make some compromises, for example using fibercane reeds rater than natural cane ones on the clarinets, saxophones, and oboe, since I would use those instruments each maybe once or twice in a set and I had no time to moisten a natural reed properly. As the years went on I got into world music and started working with instruments from other fultures, such as shakuhachi, saway, caval, bulbul tarang, punji, doumbek, crumhorn, tupan, riq, muzzar. In many cases it was a matter of adjusting my grip and adapting the techniques just a little (as for the Egyptian riq and the muzzar). In other cases, like the shakuhachi or caval, I had to learn an entirely new embouchere or fingering. In those cases I would use the Suzuki practice method for beginngers\u2014I would put the instrument someplace where I\u2019d pass by several times a day, and each time I\u2019d pick it up and try to play it a little. In a couple of weeks I\u2019d get the basics down and would be ready to work up performance pieces on it. It\u2019s also true that I would adapt my instrumentarium to the needs of every band I joined. Taking my last 3 performance groups as examples:1. Balkan-European music. I played flute, clarinet, soprano sax, mandolin, casio DH-100 digital horn, hand drums, caval, medieval flute, guitar, pipe and tabor, recorders, and a smattering of odd whistles and sirens. Oh, also banjo, and I took one really mean kazoo solo.2. Rock and roll trio. The idea we explored was that of the guitar, bass and drums, you could drop out one part and add more melody or something. I played basses (5-string electric, Ashbor, \u2018cello, alto clarinet, SLM pedal bass( digital horn), guitar, flute, soprano sax, rebec, casio DH 100 digital horn, and on one number I looped a bass line on a super nintendo using Mario Paint.3. World music with heavy influences from India, North Africa and the Arab world. Flute, clarinet, oboe, soprano sax, mando-baglamam rebec, obtave \u2018cello, hand drums, hammered dulcimer, punji, bulbul tarang, mrlodfica, keys,. My musical instrumennt resume noted that I don\u2019t keep current on all of them and if one is required it would take me a few weeks to get it up to speed. SAnd so that\u2019s my story. Others probably did it differently. ",

            "answer_text": "At one point in my life I played around 80 instruments well enough to perform in front of people either as a soloist or as part of a group - most orchestral brass and woodwinds, all stringed instruments played in bluegrass or rock bands, many percussion instruments, and lots of miscellaneous instruments like harmonicas and ocarinas. The first instrument I took lessons on was piano. I hated it and never got proficient on it but did make peace with it enough to use it for composition. My second instrument was the trombone. I took 5 lessons on it and began playing in a grade school band. I discovered that a baritone was almost identical, once I figured out the fingerings I could play it too. Then I went to the trumpet and learned about transposing. After that, all brass instruments were pretty easy with the exception of the French Horn, which was more challenging. My first woodwind was the clarinet. It could play off of the trumpet score without transposing. Next I learned alto sax. It was much easier to play but more difficult to transpose. After that, all woodwinds were pretty easy with the exception of double reed instruments like the bassoon, which were more challenging. At present I primarily play guitar, bass, banjo, mandolin, and ukulele. I started playing these in a parallel track. Back when I was learning band instruments I was in many vocal groups playing a guitar or other stringed instrument as a vocalist and accompanist. With a couple weeks practice, I could probably play any instrument I have ever played before well enough to perform in front of an audience - maybe even an instrument I have never played before. At this moment I could go to a bar for open mic night and put in a good performance vocally and on guitar. The short answer to your question is that some of us have an aptitude for playing musical instruments and it gets easier the more instruments we play. Each new instrument is reinforced by all prior instruments learned. I will also say that I have not mastered a single instrument to my satisfaction, though I have played in some world class groups.

            "answer_text": "There are many answers to this question, but I\u2019ll attempt to narrow it down to some general ideas.  1. Mastery - It\u2019s better to master one instrument first. Doing this equips you with the skills and confidence necessary to know you can learn other instruments as well. 2. Focus - When learning a new instrument, it\u2019s better to focus on one at a time until you get some decent facility with the new one. The hardest part of learning something new is the beginning. Stick with one thing for a while. 3. Persistence - Nothing sticks in your brain until you\u2019ve given it enough time. So make sure you work hard even when you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re making progress. 4. Practice - Practice specific skills until you can do them easily. Eric Clapton didn\u2019t just pick up the guitar and learn 30 songs in 7 days. He spent time working on skills until they were learned. This helps in the long run to transfer the skills to new songs. 5. Confidence - Believe you can do this because you CAN do this. People learn multiple instruments over time. It just takes effort. 6. Instruction - Obviously, you\u2019ll learn faster if someone helps you along the way. Fortunately, if you\u2019ve gotten some ability at an instrument, you can learn from people via online videos and tools. Hope this helps! Learn more from me at Home - Dynamic Music Room. ",

            "answer_text": "It took me a while to understand the fundamentals of vibration. There\u2019s no wizardry \u2014 just simple math and logic. This book covers it beautifully \u2014 Musical Instrument Design. Once you understand vibration, it\u2019s nothing to switch from brass, to windwinds, percussion, strings \u2014 from mellophones to lamellophones. String instruments are especially interesting, from the delicate hammering of the dulcimer, the bowing of the viol\u2019s, finger-picking versus plecturn strumming\u2026 Every music instrument follows the same principles. If you can tune a bar of metal, you can tuna fish. Point being, it\u2019s easy to play musical instruments un-skillfully. I can pick up anything from a pencil to a daxophone (an electric instrument made from wood that can be played with a mallet or bow) and play Mary had a Little Lamb in a matter of minutes. Give me eight hours with a tuner, and I can play a variety of scales. But no skill. Seriously, I suck. Mainly because I can\u2019t focus on anything. I have to focus on things that pay the bills. I can know all the fingering of a saxophone, but it\u2019ll take a year or so to stop squawking. I couldn\u2019t handle the squawks of reed instruments in my hands. Never will. Same goes for the violin. The left-hand is the same as mandolin. I used to be able play a few jigs, reels, and mazurkas \u2014 but it sounded like crap when I tried the violin. It would take me 10+ years to master the bow. I\u2019m too old for that. The mandolin is fun. (And Irish music is meant to be learned by ear, not lines and dots.) . Skill takes dedication and years of practice. The technique of a skilled player is what makes them shine. Think 10,000 hours per instrument. Lots of tiny muscles become strong. It\u2019s a fine-tuning of muscles and neurons to master the nuances of attack and release, and dampening of the overtones or undertones without error. A master with the electric bass guitar, moving over to nylon strings, will sound like a clutzy novice. The classical guitarist will know their way around the bass, but the left-hand technique is completely different. It\u2019s a rare creature that does both fluently. Sure, there\u2019s some crossover, like euphonium to trombone. The mouth-shapes, mouthpieces, and throat techniques are identical. The euphonium is the only instrument I had any skill at. I could play the trumpet and tuba just fine, but they require a different set of lips that ruined my embouchure for the euphonium. If I played both, I sounded crappy on both. Stick to one, and the sound was glorious. Not today though. It\u2019ll take years for me to build those muscles up again. It\u2019s not too different than other things we do with our muscles. Swimmers and runners are both amazing \u2014 but they stay out of each other\u2019s lanes. The muscles required are too different and being a strong swimmer likely means you\u2019re too top-heavy to compete on land. This is why most musicians stick within an instrument family, because their muscles are already prepared to handle it.  If you\u2019re young and love playing music \u2014 don\u2019t ever put the instruments down and stop playing with others. It\u2019s hellish. Play with others whenever you can, and cherish those moments. ",

            "answer_text": "Some instruments are very similar to others within their family. For example, there are four main saxes in the saxophone family (alto, tenor, soprano, and baritone). One could easily play all four. Saxophones are also very similar to clarinets, and clarinets have many variations as well (alto, Bb, bass, contrabass\u2026etc.) I know someone who plays three types of clarinets, and two different saxes. I know another person who can play euphonium, trombone, tuba, and trumpet. They\u2019re all similar, according to them. Adversely, it is more difficult to switch to a family NOT similar to the person\u2019s original instrument i.e. flute to tuba, tuba to flute, trombone to clarinet, etc. Not that it\u2019s impossible, it just takes more work. I once had a friend say it was easy to play any instrument after learning piano because he could listen for the pitches. Whether that was just him or not, I\u2019m not sure. Myself, I can play the main saxophones described and Bb clarinet, but am working to learn the French horn. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer to this is a lot of practice! The slightly longer answer is that if you start to become really comfortable with one instrument, generally picking up another with similar skills (such as a brass instrument) isn\u2019t too hard - for example all brass instruments make their sound by making a buzz with your lips, so while you will have to adjust slightly to different mouthpieces, you are still applying the same basic skill. Once you have an affinity with w few it becomes easier, a little like learning languages, you\u2019\u2019\u2019 recognise patterns, musicality etc across the instruments. Not easy though - good luck!
