            "answer_text": "There could be a couple of factors I could think of: Reed is soaked in spit.You simply replace the used reed with a dry reed. A reed that is soaked is not firm, and can have an effect on performance Your instrument needs to be cleaned out.You do not blow just air. You also blow saliva into your instrument. Over time, they\u2019ll line the walls of the clarinet and have an effect on the sound. Use a cleaning kit to clean the clarinet out. Do so frequently to keep your instrument in good shape. If neither of them work, have it looked at by a repair specialist. I played a soprano saxophone, which is basically a different looking clarinet, and run into these issues at the end of a long practice session, and these two suggestions usually solves that kind of issue.

            "answer_text": "Define a while. Playing the clarinet for a while could result in a tired embrochure and as a result, a lesser seal around the mouthpiece. Playing on a reed with a slightly high strength relative to the player can result in this.
