            "answer_text": "Research before buying your harmonica, you see there are various types of harmonica out there and have characteristically differentiable sound and are preferred to play in specific genres of music and different styles of playing (now that doesn't means that can't play other genres in a particular harmonica, but they may not necessarily produce they desired sound that you are looking for or they might just give u harder time playing than a harmonica that's usually preferred to be played in that genre, most of the time it's just hard to do so but not impossible). So you must make sure of the genre you will be playing the most in. The two most popular type of harmonicas are Diatonic and Chromatic and we will talk only about them today since most of the tutorials are based on these types of harps and it's also easier to find a teacher to learn these types of harps than any other type of harmonica. The type of harmonicas that I play are called as diatonic harmonica or blues harmonica and is usually played in genres like blues, country, country rock, blues rock, etc.. These harmonica tends to have a more bluesier sound or the way we like to call it is a dirtier sound. These harmonicas are set in different keys (if you don't know what keys are then you probably don't know basic music theory and that's okay, I will try and simplify thing for u), these harmonicas are probably the most easiest harmonicas to begin with and a begginer should start with the key of c harmonica since it's the most basic key and most of the songs are set in this key, there are are total of 12 keys of harmonica out there, as u progress u will realise that you will be needing more than one key of harmonica to play better so they can get get a bit expensive but it's definitely gonna be worth it if you are passionate about it. Unlike diatonic harmonica chromatic harmonicas don't have keys, so one harmonica is gonna do it all. In my opinion these harmonicas are best for just playing songs. These harmonicas can be a bit more challenging to begin with than a diatonic harmonica but it is completely okay to begin on this type of harmonica. Note- I don't have enough experience with this type of harmonica so I'm stick to my good ol\u2019 blues harp. So which one should you get? In my opinion u should start with a Hohner Special 20 key of C (diatonic harp), start playing this harmonica and once u are over that beginner level then decide what you want go forward with. But if you want to buy something else then make sure u go through some professional reviews on YouTube regarding those harps and if there are no reviews on YouTube for the model you are looking for then don't buy it cause it's probably a toy and not an intstrument. Finding a teacher. Find yourself a local teacher and if that's not possible then learn it from YouTube, there are ample of harmonica tutorial videos out there and it's also quite an easy instrument to learn so it's not gonna be that hard, even I learnt it from YouTube. Books are helpful too. Hope this helps you :) ",
