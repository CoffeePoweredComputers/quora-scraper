            "answer_text": "No, he did not. If only by chance in Las Vegas where they both performed in the 70`s. Later, Michael Jackson alleged he met Elvis in Las Vegas, when he took Lisa Marie Presley to see the Jacksons, who were her favorite group. Allegedly, he fell in love with Elvis 6 year old daughter, whom he contacted a few years later through his attorney John Branca, who happened to know her mother Priscilla Presley. That was however a lie to justify his out of the blue marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, whom he married after the 1993 allegations of child abuse. The marriage was a publicity stunt. They separated in less than 2 years and they justified their short lived marriage alleging Lisa Marie Presley \u2018s reluctance to have kids with Michael, which the latter wanted badly. Michael Jackson did want kids but not by Lisa Marie Presley. That was an excuse they came up to justify their separation. The marriage was a sham. Michael Jackson never cited Elvis Presley as his influence. He was hugely influenced by James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Sammy Davis Junior, Fred Astaire. He did not marry Lisa Marie to associate himself with the Presley name. Michael had met Lisa Marie a couple of years earlier at a mutual friend \u2018s house, while she was trying to kick off a singing career. Michael Jackson wad pressured to find a wife for image making reasons after the 1993 allegations of child molestation. Lisa Marie had just separated from her husband and he asked her to marry him over the phone, which she accepted. Allegedly, he asked Brooke Shields first who however declined as at the time she was dating tennis player Agassi. In short, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson never actually met. ",
