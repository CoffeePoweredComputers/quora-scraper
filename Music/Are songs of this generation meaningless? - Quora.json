            "answer_text": "I always said I wouldn't be one of those people that wouldn't give the next generations music a chance. I consider my generation 60s & 70s music. I love it. I love 80s & 90s music. As the new millennium started, something changed. A few years ago , I went to a Don Henley concert. At the start, he asked \u201cwhat's happened to music?\u201d Many factors have caused the downward spiral. The internet has affected how music is made and sold. Radio is dying. There aren't bands anymore. Nobody goes to a record store anymore. Free music is everywhere. The younger generation has grown up with rap hip hop and auto tune. They must be entertained with visual affects and dancers to be stimulated. Many artists aren't writing and creating music anymore. Many can no longer make a living at it. And to answer your question, there are still a few meaningful songs. Just not very many. Rap and hip hop is not music. Music has rythym and melody. And the pop songs of today are over produced with nobody playing the instruments. They sound the same. Nothing unique. That you could say makes them meaningless. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t go there. Seriously. Songs of this generation don\u2019t speak to you, or me, for that matter. They\u2019re not meant to. They\u2019re not written for you and me. Then again, maybe you\u2019re simply not finding the music that would have meaning for you. I mean, there\u2019s more music out there now than ever before and more ways to find it than ever before. If all you\u2019re listening to is the radio and whatever Spotify is feeding you, you\u2019ll very rarely hear anything that speaks to you. Good music often requires a little work from the listener, and so does finding it. I hated it when the older generation constantly knocked the music that meant, that still means, SO much to me when I was a kid; I swore that I\u2019d never do that when I was older and I\u2019d combat this very line of thinking forever. Who the hell are we to judge? Every new generation takes a whole rash of grief from the older. Always have and probably always will, and it\u2019s just so futile and pointless and just creates needless divisions between generations. Do I like much of today\u2019s popular music? No, not really. But I\u2019ve never really liked much popular music, especially when it was current. ",
