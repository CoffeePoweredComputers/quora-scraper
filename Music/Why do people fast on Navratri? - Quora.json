            "answer_text": " What is the logic behind the fast of Navaratri? Before, that why do we celebrate the Durga Puja festival? Why is the killing of Mahishasura commemorated every year? What does the buffalo headed demon Mahishasura symbolizes?  When we convert an idea into an action from the stage of Indra it reaches the Yama stage and becomes a compulsive action, over which we have little control? It must be mentioned here that the buffalo head of Mahishasura is derived from the vehicle of Yama, which is a buffalo. Every year we should reset our life so that our ideas are converted into actions from Shakti stage only and not from a point beyond that.  The stage at which our ideas are converted into actions by Durga must be precisely tuned every year because what may be a simple task may become demonic next year, or we may be capable of achieving more. What does fasting has to do here? What exactly is fasting? Is it living without food or surviving on permissible food? Fasting actually has nothing to do with food, as popularly believed. It is about spending the day by avoid the controllable, small force of short duration and surviving on just the uncontrollable, mighty and eternal automatic force. The small force enables us to pretend and do all kinds of evil. Thus, in the first seven or eight days of Durga Puja we are supposed to survive on just the automatic force and reset and fine tune where exactly Durga will convert our ideas into actions. In the absence of this fasting we will let our ideas be demonic so that they are mighty, though uncontrollable. Since we can\u2019t know what is controllable force, we symbolize it with certain food with it and just avoid them.  We just eat permissible food. Thus, fasting during Navaratri is meant to enable us to depend on just the uncontrollable, mighty and eternal force, that interlinks all the activities of our life and let our life, be reset and fine tuned, so that Durga converts our ideas into actions in such a way that they are powerful and yet not demonic.
