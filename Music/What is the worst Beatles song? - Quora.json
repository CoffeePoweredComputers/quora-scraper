            "answer_text": "I\u2019m surprised at some of the answers on here. Maggie Mae, for example - sure, it\u2019s not great, but it clearly wasn\u2019t meant to be. It\u2019s there to give a sense of irreverence that was the Beatles at that time and, like Dig It, it provides the album with some of the randomness of the film whilst managing not to sabotage it. Ob la di and Yellow Submarine - I can understand people not caring for either but to dismiss them as the worst Beatles\u2019 song is again missing the point. They are huge and iconic and the kitchness is clearly intentional. They are revered by people who are not necessarily Beatles fans at all, by people that have never heard of Run for your Life or I Don\u2019t Want to Spoil the Party. Yellow Submarine was a huge gamble because it showed the Beatles weren\u2019t afraid to do something outside the norm, so different from their usual output. Revolution 9 - again, a dreadful \u2018song\u2019 (if you choose to call it such) but important. What other band would have done that? Skip it for the sake of your ears and sanity but celebrate it at the same time. I am less convinced, though, by tracks such as Wild Honey Pie which would have been better shortened and used as an ending to a more substantial track (a bit like the Heba, Heba halloa at the end of Hello Goodbye. The Beatles at that time had become very self indulgent, and I could easily live without many tracks on the White Album. But what I really find annoying are the tracks that don\u2019t seem to go anywhere, as if they never bothered to finish them. Your Mother Should Know is potentially a great song, the opening is very catchy. The trouble is, the opening is all there is. Four phrases and you have all the melody. McCartney sings \u2018Say it again\u2019 and that is virtually what you get, repetition, apart from a middle that is so vague and unmelodic you wonder why he never bothered to try a little harder, not helped by a lyric that doesn\u2019t mean anything but sounds as if it does. I also find some of the indulgence of Lennon lyrically incredibly annoying. I\u2019m surprised nobody\u2019s mentioned \u2018Happiness is a Warm Gun\u2019 where lines like \u2018a soap impression of his wife which he ate\u2019 etc. etc. are too long to be self-parodying. But for me the worst song by far is \u2018Don\u2019t Pass me By.\u2019 Played badly, recorded badly, sung badly, even produced badly; it swings like a well-heeled paving stone, out of tune even by Ringo\u2019s standards, banal lyrics and a melody that you\u2019d make up on the spot as an example of a cliched country song. Whatever the magic that turned Octupus\u2019s Garden into a listenable song against all the odds wasn\u2019t present on the day they recorded Don\u2019t Pass me By. Resist the message of the title and pass it by. And vote it the worst song. FURTHER TO READING COMMENTS I agree with anybody who says this is an uncool process, but I never asked the question\u2026the main difficulty with it is that, if you think a song is bad, unless you are some kind of congenital fool or have a death wish you\u2019re not likely to be in the habit of listening to what you consider the worst Beatle tracks; so to answer this question you probably have to write about tracks you haven\u2019t actually heard in years. Therefore, to be fair, I listened to \u2018Don\u2019t Pass me By,\u2019 trying to be positive about it. So here goes:- It contains the lyric:- \u2018I'm sorry that I doubted you,I was so unfair.You were in a car crash,And you lost your hair.\u2019 I find this interesting because way back in those heady days of love there was an odd need many of felt to prove that Paul MacCartney had died in a car crash. We played bits of recording backwards and analysed record covers to the nth degree in what I now suspect was a subconscious competition to see how contrived we could all be, under the illusion we were being serious; curiously the one line that specifically mentioned a car crash nobody ever mentioned at all*. This may indicate that the track, even then, was considered so bad even self-appointed adolescent sleuths couldn\u2019t bear to listen to it. I also note the abysmally overdubbed fiddle was played by Jack Fallon. Jack was an agent, who ran \u2018Cana Variety.\u2019 He specialised in singing pianists, and in the early nineties I worked for him. I asked him about Don\u2019t Pass me By and he told me he\u2019d sold the violin on which he\u2019d played for several hundred pounds, even though it was a cheap instrument. His wife commented that he was an idiot as he could have sold them any violin (\u2018they wouldn\u2019t have known\u2019.) He showed me a typed contract which dated from about 1963 stating he\u2019d booked: \u2018The Beatles (quartet)\u2019 for the sum of \u00a315. The fact that they used an agent playing a cheap instrument rather than a professional on a strad says it all. Listening to it again after all these years I believe this track is truly awful. Even if it was Alf Cutler and the Wurzels or the 1992 Albanian World Cup Squad it would be an embarrassment. But good luck to all those people that like it. As has been pointed out, you have a right to your opinion however wrong it might be. *According to Wikipedia the line about \u2018losing your hair\u2019 IS cited by proponents of the \"Paul is Dead\" urban legend. But I don\u2019t remember that the first time around, probably because I was too busy inhaling smoking dried banana skins in a kaftan. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. May I confess, I haven\u2019t read all the existing answers yet - 56 at this point - so I may accidentally repeat someone. Apologies in advance, if I do. My answer: The Long and Winding Road as violated by Phil Spector on the original Let It Be album. The true song itself is near perfection, as proven by every other performance McCartney\u2019s done, including on Let It Be - Naked. The ruination of the original came through the work of Phil Spector. Those strings, real or other!! Spector committed one of the most invasive arrangements and pieces of production I can think of. It says \u201cignore McCartney - look at me - aren\u2019t I beautiful and smarmy?\u201d Yep, there\u2019s a good reason why McCartney has never (to my knowledge) performed this genius song in any way resembling Spector\u2019s abomination. How can I claim it\u2019s a great song, yet denounce it as their worst song? Well, if many Beatles songs are great thanks to the contributions of George Martin, then sadly they could also be ruined by Spector. We need to remember, John sent the Let It Be tapes to Spector, and the others didn\u2019t even know he was playing around with them. Can you imagine how Paul must\u2019ve reacted when he heard yet another of his genius compositions trashed, only for it to then be released to the world as if he wanted it like that? I wonder how many times he said \u201cActually, that\u2019s not how I wanted it - I hate those strings! So don\u2019t blame me!\u201d Now, please allow me to repeat, the oft-used \u201cI\u2019m surprised by many of the entries\u201d opening line. :) How do we define \u201cworst song\u201d? It\u2019s good to hear the songs people dislike, but that\u2019s all bonus, because \u201cdislike the most\u201d does not equal \u201cworst\u201d. Experimental pieces, like Revolution 9 and Wild Honey Pie, shouldn\u2019t get trashed just because they fall outside our norms for 3 minute rock-pop songs. They may not pass audition for \u201cLiverpool, You\u2019ve Got Talent!\u201d, but they are incredibly well constructed Beatles songs that keep reminding us why The Beatles remain unsurpassed in revolutionising music. Composers like Stockhausen and Cage had been creating experimental music for some time, so this stuff was not new. However, as early as 1966 with Revolver, The Beatles were already able to assimilate obscure, high-brow experimentalism into their own creativity and produce material that was among best of breed. If you really think these are the worst Beatles songs, get your best audio gear, best headphones, perfect listening conditions, listen to the details and lose yourself in the music - hear what\u2019s going on - ask yourself, \u201cHow are they doing that - what\u2019s happening?\u201d Ponder: \u201cWhich later, highly respected artists may have learned their craft, style and success by listening to these pieces?\u201d You might become a fan! :) Playful pieces, such as Yellow Submarine, Octopus\u2019 Garden, Don\u2019t Pass Me By, Ob La Di Ob La Da and Piggies are not \u201cworst\u201d just because some people think they\u2019re silly or inane. For me, pieces like these are part song and part scenes from imagined movies or musicals. Let\u2019s think about Don\u2019t Pass Me By, which seems to be popular among these answers. That fiddle! It\u2019s not just an instrument, it\u2019s also a musical prop for the song! We\u2019re no longer in our living room or at a concert, we\u2019re in Hicksville America, yee-ha! And Ringo, he\u2019s not trying to sing like Sinatra, Presley, nor even himself. He\u2019s being the scrappiest, loneliest, sorriest hick of them all! At least he has his feeble hick band with him, squeezed into his dusty front room, giving him their all as they do their bit for our Sunday afternoon \u201cMa & Pa Kettle\u201d movie. Fantastic! Let yourself be transported into the scene, rather than judge the \u201cmusical quality\u201d - after all, the quality was intentional hicked for your listening pleasure. I\u2019ll stop the whinging there. Thank you. Please have a good day! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of contenders - unhappily quire a lot of them are by George (which I regret: I\u2019m a George fan and his best stuff is fab.) Among the contenders is Blue Jay Way - a dismal dirge. He was trying to evoke a sense of boredom and dissipation and succeeded brilliantly. Then there is Only A Northern Song - sorry, it\u2019s abysmal. Let\u2019s give George a break here and consider other contenders. I\u2019m leaving aside things like Revolution #9 because it is not, actually, a song. And Wild Honey Pie - similarly, is really just a squib. Why Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road is a failure - John was brilliant at doing this kind of \u2018feel\u2019 song (eg Come Together) and Paul wanted to do one. Should have been talked out of it. What\u2019s The New Mary Jane is awful, but that\u2019s not fair because the Fabs never worked it up into a proper song - if you listen to demos of songs that did make it on to record (Mean Mr Mustard) you might think they were worthless too, and then the Beatles would fettle them to something wonderful. Run For Your Life (on Rubber Soul) is wretched - lazy, sloppy, badly played, and unpleasant in tone. You can see how it happened. John was obviously thinking of a past triumph - clearly You Can\u2019t Do That (if you haven\u2019t listened to that recently, go back and have another listen - it is magnificent) and thought he\u2019d reprise his achievement. He blew it. And rather badly. There are other Beatles songs that are bad for various reasons, but which don\u2019t plumb the depths of some of these (honourable mentions - Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer, Savoy Truffle, It\u2019s All Too Much - sorry George again). But the more interesting point is that good Beatles songs outnumber bad ones by a large margin, and great Beatles songs are a very large proportion of the oevre. My view? The Beatles had the best strike rate of great tracks of anybody ever. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to choose 5 bad songs from the greatest band of all time (in my opinion), but here we go.  From least worst to worst: 5. Maggie Mae - Let It Be A 40 second rendition of an old Liverpool song that is\u2026 not so great. It sticks out like a sore thumb when you realize that it\u2019s surrounded by two masterpieces: \u201cLet It Be\u201d before and \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u201d afterwards. 4. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer - Abbey Road During his prime, Paul McCartney took a detour of rich songs with deep meaning to make a song about a kid who murders people with a silver hammer. Luckily, McCartney would redeem himself if Abbey Road with the very next track: Oh! Darling! However, this song is for some reason put in between George Harrison\u2019s masterpiece Something and then the aforementioned Oh! Darling. In my opinion, it shouldn\u2019t have made the album at all since it feels so out of place. 3. Within You, Without You - Sgt. Pepper George Harrison was a fantastic songwriter. You couldn\u2019t tell from this. Coming off his great contributions on Revolver and Rubber Soul, this entry to the finest Beatles album there is just doesn\u2019t sound like The Beatles. In my opinion, it\u2019s the only disappointing entry on the album. 2. You Know The Name (Look Up The Number) - Single God awful. That\u2019s all I really have to say. Revolution 9 - The White AlbumThis may be the only Beatle song that I would label as pure garbage. Almost every Beatles song, good or bad, have some redeemable qualities in them. Revolution 9 does not. It is one of the most bizarre piece of rubbish I\u2019ve ever listened to. Yoko and John really went out of their way to close out the album on a poor note here. I\u2019m not a fan of it in the slightest. I will never again listen to the entirety of The White Album because of this song. I skip it and go straight to Good Night every time. ",

            "answer_text": "The worst Beatles song is one of those those which people did not understand. How can you understand Revolution 9? Ok, they tried, or just John Lennon, tried to experiment with psychedelia and take it even further. Which I don\u2019t think he did quite well. He must be really high when he got this idea. But the concept of psychedelia really is based on the effects of psychedelic drugs,which often causes experience of visual and auditory shifts, altered state of consciousness, or what we refer to as being \u201chigh\u201d as in high up in cloud nine singing and dancing with unicorn pooping rainbows and sneezing candies. Things like that. Please take note that I\u2019ve never been high before, and the strongest drug that was ever induced to me was general anesthesia when I was only 5. So I never really have experienced these kinds of things. But in Psychology, you will somehow understand the effects of psychedelics. There is a reason why psychedelia was not so much of a boom! compared to it\u2019s sister genre. But this kind of style\u2014the psychedelia\u2014gave birth to newer better styles. Take Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin for example, I can distinguish five or six different changes throughout the same song and it\u2019s not even psychedelia its in the hard rock genre, but the rhythm and melodic change throughout the song is characteristic of psychedelic rock\u2014only that it\u2019s not so much of a smooth transition it\u2019s often wavy. And now here comes our current pop songs sounding more and more monotonous, perhaps we need a new wave of psychedelia just to insert diversification? Oh, wait\u2026 I\u2019m a little off topic. Anyway, Revolution 9 was the worst Beatles track, I don\u2019t even consider it a song. The first time I heard it, I thought my record was broken. But no. It\u2019s just really that. Some silly things the rich and famous do and people just support because they are rich and famous. In fairness to the Beatles, they have been very creative and quite fearless in their musical experiment. Only that psychedelia was a bit coo coo, well it was really intended to. ",

            "answer_text": "I am definitely a Beatles fan and of course the question is completely subjective. As I perused the answers given by people I noticed I was fond of quite a few song mentioned. As always with that which is a subjective choice, many do not care to mention \u201cWhy\u201d it is the worst song they recorded. When I saw this question only one song leapt to the forefront of my consciousness. It is a song from the \u2018White Album\u201d and written and recorded by Paul McCartney. It is wholly repetitive piece which drove me insane. I had a friend that played it incessantly. I personally have not listened to it voluntarily in forty three years. It is short and simple; 1:42 of twelve-bar blues that begins with three different percussion elements (a hand banging on the back of an acoustic guitar, handclaps, and drums) and features McCartney's increasingly raucous vocal repeating a simple lyric with only two different lines. McCartney wrote the song after seeing two monkeys copulating in the street while on retreat in Rishikesh, India. He marvel led in the simplicity of this natural scenario when compared to the emotional turmoil of human relationships. He later said \u201cA male [monkey] just hopped on the back of this female and gave her one, as they say in the vernacular. Within two or three seconds he hopped off again and looked around as if to say \"It wasn't me!\" and she looked around as if there'd been some mild disturbance ... And I thought ... that's how simple the act of procreation is ... We have horrendous problems with it, and yet animals don't.\u201d Not only is the song foul but it caused strife within the group, mainly that Paul would write and record his own songs with no one else present. From what I had read of Paul\u2019s explanation, everyone was busy except for Ringo when this was performed. Sounds reasonable to me but these are humans with egos arguing so what is to be expected. Here it is in all its glory. 1 minute 42 seconds of \u2018Why Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road\u201d. Here are the lyrics: Why don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadNo one will be watching usWhy don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadNo one will be watching usWhy don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadWhy don't we do it in the roadNo one will be watching usWhy don't we do it in the road And as I am looking at the lyrics I am getting nauseous and feel as though I need to drill a few holes in my head.

            "answer_text": "Like many, I was quite surprised by some of the responses. To each his own. I\u2019m not going to consider any short, inconsequential songs in my answer - so no \u201cMaggie Mae\u201d, \u201cFlying\u201d, etc. (I happen to like \u201cDig It\u201d and \u201cWild Honey Pie\u201d, by the way.) I\u2019m also not including any covers or pre-1965 songs. I couldn\u2019t resist this question, but would rather not wade through the early records - which I know less intimately - to determine which ones to include. Finally, my list only includes official canonical releases (no\u201d If You\u2019ve Got Trouble\u201d, etc). Disclaimer out of the way, on to the list. Worst Beatles songs to me are: \u201cRevolution 9\u201d - It\u2019s not even a song, so it may not even belong here. (\u201cWhat Goes On\u201d could sub) In any case, if it were under 2 minutes, maybe I\u2019d regard it as an interesting experiment. At 8 minutes or whatever, well\u2026.oh no Yoko. \u201cYou Know My Name\u201d - I guess you had to be there to appreciate the joke. \u201cDon\u2019t Pass Me By\u201d - simply awful in every way, as others have pointed out. \u201cBlue Jay Way\u201d - tuneless, morose, dreary, monotonous. George certainly succeeded in capturing the feeling of waiting all night for someone to turn up. \u201cWithin You, Without You\u201d - Pretty much the same as the previous - just longer. I\u2019d like to offer a couple of variations. Worst Lennon/McCartney Beatles songs. It looks like I beat up on George and Ringo on my main list, so let\u2019s give them a break here: \u201cAnother Girl\u201d, \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d - lyrics are unforgivable, \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201d, \u201cYour Mother Should Know\u201d, \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer.\u201d The other variation would be, \u201cworst popular Beatles Songs\u201d. I eschew the word \u201coverrated\u201d because most of these either have lots of detractors, weren\u2019t hits, or were simply never rated very highly to begin with - if that makes sense. All appear on singles and/or compilation albums, hence the term, \u201cpopular\u201d. Dishonorable mention goes to: \u201cEight Days A Week\u201d - Contrived and formulaic, just super lame. The title is the best thing about it. \u201cAcross The Universe\u201d - weak melody, insipid performance, sophomoric lyrics. know a lot of people like this, but I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so great about it. \u201cThe Long And Winding Road\u201d - yeah the Spector treatment was overdone, but the song itself is too maudlin for my taste. \u201cOld Brown Shoe\u201d - listened to it recently, not as bad as I thought. It\u2019s got some great guitar, but still not quite good enough for a B-side. \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d - sorry Ringo, but no\u2026. great drummer and a lovely bloke, though. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few Beatle originals that don\u2019t really do it for me, and that I don\u2019t care if I never hear again. They\u2019re not awful, and most are pretty good when compared with other music at the time, just not compared with other Beatle songs. Here they are in no particular order, and no, Revolution 9 isn\u2019t on the list. I love that one. When I Get Home (This one annoys me, especially the \u201cwoo oh woo hi!\u201d)Run For Your Life (Hate the lyrics - so misogynist)Hold Me Tight (Gives me a headache)What You\u2019re Doing (Too repetitive, no real melody)I Call Your Name (Terrible guitar solo, weak melody)Revolution 1 (acoustic version) (Love the single, but this version is dull)Wild Honey Pie (Horrible. Maybe their worst. No tune at all and interrupts the flow of an otherwise superb album side)Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer (Cloying. Too cute)What Goes On (Sounds bad in comparison to the great songs around it on Rubber Soul)You Know My Name (Look Up the Number) (Fun the first few times but then I don\u2019t need to hear it again)The Long and Winding Road (Overly lush, trying too hard to be significant, long, dull)Love Me Do (Historically important but a lame song, really. Very repetitive. Sounds like I could have written it)Tell Me What You See (Hate the lyrics, but cool electric piano)Blue Jay Way (Long, ponderous, boring, hate the production)Flying (Harmless but dumb. Well below the group\u2019s usual standards)Your Mother Should Know (See \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d above)I\u2019ll Get You (Melody isn\u2019t strong, poorly performed with lyric errors)Hello Goodbye (See \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d)Helter Skelter (I appreciate what they tried to do but it\u2019s too loud and gives me a headache)It\u2019s Only Love (Lennon said the lyric was dumb and he hated the song. He was his own harshest critic but in this case he was right).That\u2019s about 20 songs out of nearly 200 originals they wrote (Lennon/McCartney, plus George and Ringo\u2019s songs). The other 90% or so are great! ",

            "answer_text": "For me, in general, the worst Beatles songs are the McCartney songs that Lennon referred to as \u201cgranny\u201d songs. I came to these conclusions independently, long before internet made me aware of Lennon\u2019s or other people\u2019s opinions. There are also several songs that bore me shirtless, that other\u2019s think are brilliant. These tend to be the McCartney hit songs. I know that most people will disagree with me, especially about Michelle and Here, There and Everywhere, which are considered some of the finest Beatles\u2019 songs. So, here is my list. Don\u2019t get upset. It\u2019s only personal taste: 10. Revolution number 9 - I know of nobody that has listened to this track more than once.9. Wild Honey Pie - Throw away filler8. Honey Pie - McCartney music hall granny music7. The Long and Winding Road - McCartney dirge.6. Yesterday- Along with Michelle, considered one of the great Beatle song. Well crafted pablum.5. Your Mother Should know - McCartney granny music.4. Michelle - Another slick, well crafted song others love, but I skip.3. Here, There and Everywhere - Dirgy well crafted pop song.2. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer - Granny to the max. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da - Considered by many to be the most objectionable Beatles song.One might get the feeling that I despise all McCartney songs, but this isn\u2019t the case. Paperback Writer and I\u2019ve Just Seen a Face are two of my favorite Beatle songs, but, in the great Lennon guy/McCartney guy binary division of personality types, I\u2019m a Lennon guy. ",

            "answer_text": "They worst Beatles songs? That\u2019s a loaded question. It\u2019s all based on opinion in\u2019t it.? I grew up listening to a radio when The Beatles came on with \u201cShe Loves You\u201d.  And when \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d came on.  I was up East in the snow in Mass. I was 10 or 12. And when those songs came on, I was in inner hysteria. I had found my music, not my eldest sister\u2019s Elvis Presley hysteria in the 50\u2019s, nor my other older sister\u2019s white pop radio crap. They were 4 and 8 years older. Then suddenly Ed Sullivan! Those songs coming out of that radio. Damn there were and still are my band, my boys. Th best, the cutest, the funniest. Unless you were one of those hysterical fans like me, you wouldn\u2019t understand. My sister took me to the drive-in with her boyfriend when \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d came out. I was in the back seat, and from the credits all the way through I screamed and cried and felt I would faint, I was in a tizzy, a manic love and excitement. I loved that movie. (note: when they got me home I was still hysterical. My Mom gave me a tranquilizer and put me to bed.) Anyway\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t have too many songs that I don\u2019t like. Especially from their early albums. And especially from \u201cBeatles For Sale\u201d ,\u201cRubber Soul\u201d or \u201cRevolver\u201d. I moved to Europe in 1964 and lived there for almost 5 years, in Italy and in Germany. My Beatles albums are the European releases EMI which carried 12+ tracks, much different than the U.S. hodgepoge of make a buck releases. The EMI discs were vetted by the Beatles, the track placements were seriously determined before the discs were released so they have a flow and consistent theme and the songs creatively placed. From \u201cBeatles For Sale\u201d (with that gorgeous photo on the cover), I loved all those songs. The only clinker has to be \u201cMr. Moonlight\u201d. They just sound straind, and the song not written by them, the lyrics I don\u2019t enjoy or the melody. From \u201cHelp\u201d I loved the whole album. The beginning song is relevant and just explodes in your brain. From \u201cRubber Soul\u201d (my favorite album) once again I love every song. From \u201cRevolver\u201d, I liked all the songs, again. From \u201cSgt Pepper\u2019s \u201c I again love these songs. Except for two that stop the flow, down right pause the fun of the album. \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201dis o.k. but I listened to it rarely. and George\u2019s \u201cWithin You or Without You\u201d \u201cThe Magical Mystery Tour\u201d was not an album in Europe. Instead it was released as a book with 45\u2019s hidden inside. Released in 1967, It is a small book with 0 pages of photos and cartoons showing the bus tour. Th 45s are from Odeon and EMI. There are two discs, 2 songs on each disc. Disc 1: Side one\u2026..Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know. Side two\u2026. I am The Walrus. Record 2\u2026. Side one\u2026The Fool On The Hill and Flying. Side two\u2026.Blue Jay Way.Of course you know the clinkers on this. Sorry George. \u201cFlying\u201d and \u201cBlue Jay Way\u201d are filler. Blue Jay Way is junk and noise that is aa headache Nxt \u201cThe White Album\u201d Holy Baloney\u2026..aa..lot of crap on here. \u201cWild Honey Pie\u201d shows they could put all kinds of crap out in public. Zepers. \u201c Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da \u2026\u2026.I can understand why Lennon wanted to choke Paul over this nonsense tripe. Considering he made the band do take over take\u2026..George and Ringo hated this stupid song. Lennon left, went out and got drunk. Returned and declared\u2026\u201dTHIS is how the piano should sound!!!\u201d And proceeded to play it as you hear it now. And much better than Paul\u2019s original melody\u201d A stinker was that song. \u201cYer Blues\u201d I didn\u2019t like \u201dEverybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey \u201c. They sound great, but I don\u2019t like the song. Helter Skelter is another one that is a waste. Hate that song. And of course everyone\u2019s favorite to hate. Revolution 9. yoko must have slipped him some mickey\u2019s. Crap. My opinion only. A couple of stinkers is not bad from a catloque of 200 masterpiecers. ",

            "answer_text": "A very easy question: If You\u2019ve Got Trouble. Throwaway trash, which the band rightly considered not worth releasing.What\u2019s the New Mary Jane. Lennon was proud of this sloppy exercise in arbitrariness but when a song is even worse than \u2018Rocky Raccoon\u2019 or \u2018Bungalow Bill\u2019, it\u2019s not surprising it never got issued.That Means A Lot. Interesting experiment but McCartney couldn\u2019t get the melody to work.12-Bar Original. A pointless blues jam.Carnival of Light. Nothing I have heard about this free improvisation makes me think that the Beatles could possibly have made something interesting with this.\u2026Unless you meant \u2018songs they actually released at the time\u2019, in which case it\u2019s: Run For Your Life. Dumb, not very tuneful, misogynistic rewrite of a forgettable Elvis song. Unworthy in every way of the band and its writer.Piggies. Mean-spirited, irritating ditty by Harrison in maximum-judgemental mode. It\u2019s not their fault that it inspired Charles Manson, but if it hadn\u2019t been on the album he wouldn\u2019t have been able to be inspired by it. Ian Macdonald records that when Harrison was recording the song, he started playing another melody on the harpsichord (possibly \u2018Something\u2019, I\u2019ll check) and producer Chris Thomas commented \u2018That\u2019s nice,\u2019 before adding hopefully, \u2018\u2026couldn\u2019t we do that instead?\u2019Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer. Stupid joke song given a lavish production it didn\u2019t deserve, like a turd on a golden platter.Blue Jay Way: George, boredom is not a promising subject for a song, as this song demonstrates. The fact that anyone can think that the majestic \u2018Within You Without You\u2019 is inferior to this, is baffling to me.Hello, Goodbye: There\u2019s good mindless pop songs and there\u2019s bad mindless pop songs. This is one idea stretched out for three and a half minutes. McCartney has claimed that it\u2019s an attempt to explore the fundamental dualities in the universe and blah blah blah. That\u2019s crap. It\u2019s just dumb.",

            "answer_text": "\"Maggie Mae\". In 2001 the rec.music.beatles usenet newsgroup ran an elimination tournament among hard-core Beatles fans to determine the worst Beatles song from the original studio albums. The results were as follows from 10th worst to worst: 10. Matchbox 9. Act Naturally 8. Don't Pass Me By 7. Honey Don't  6. Revolution 9 5. Mr. Moonlight 4. A Taste Of Honey  3. Wild Honey Pie  2. Dig It 1. Maggie Mae Note that \"Maggie Mae\" here is not related to the similarly-titled Rod Stewart song, but is the Beatles' version of the traditional English ballad. It loses points for several reasons: At just 40 seconds it is just a snippet of a song;It is a goofy, addled performance;It is placed immediately following the timeless title track of the Let It Be album, breaking the mood and coming off like a fart in church;It was chosen for inclusion and placed there by Phil Spector, whose work on that album is ill-regarded by many, notably Paul McCartney.\"Dig It\", the runner-up in this worst-song contest, appears on the same album as another short snippet and is disliked for many of the same reasons, though it is a Lennon composition rather than a traditional. \"Wild Honey Pie\" is, again, a sub-one minute sketch of a song by McCartney. The only full-length songs on this list that are not covers are the Ringo composition \"Don't Pass Me By\" and the experimental sound collage \"Revolution 9\", mostly a Lennon work. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there is no \u201cworst Beatles song\u201d simply because no matter what they put out, it was commercially successful. As it is said in the other answers, most of the snippets of songs and the covers are the bad songs, so for my answer I will exclude them here. I am also excluding songs that many people consider to be their worst already to avoid parity (aka Revolution 9, Yellow Submarine, Ringo\u2019s songs, etc.). Basically, I\u2019m rewriting the question a little bit to ask, \u201cWhat is the worst Beatles song that people actually think is good?\u201d So without those choices, my consensus \u201cworst Beatles song\u201d is\u2026 All Together Now WAIT WAIT WAIT!!!! Hear me out! Now before people come screaming at me that I\u2019m criticizing a popular, lovable song, I\u2019d like to give my reasons. Although some people find this song to be a decent listen, it sounds so much like a quick children\u2019s song with no meaning. It seems like a follow up to Yellow Submarine, but intended for an EVEN YOUNGER audience. The guitar is not bad, but it can\u2019t save the childish and monotonous lyrics. It legitimately sounds like they wrote it in five minutes, and unlike quickly written songs like You Won't See Me and A Hard Day\u2019s Night (which were actually written is 3 hours and 6 hours respectively), it doesn\u2019t hit the mark as a good hit. Now of course this was for the Yellow Submarine movie, and they were asked to write a closing song, so they penned this up, but I feel that they could have done so much better. I hope that helped you out! Feel free to let me know what you guys think of All Together Now, and tell me what you guys think is worse. ",

            "answer_text": "Worst is relative. There are few songs by the Beatles that am I inclined to actually skip because I hate them that much. Even the ones I dislike still seem to be part of the bigger picture in the context of the album. Still, there are some Beatles songs I wouldn\u2019t want to introduce a new fan to: Nothing too out of the ordinary here: Mr. Moonlight \u2014 Piano Red\u2019s original is marginally better (as seen here) but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good song.Everybody\u2019s Trying to be my Baby \u2014 Carl Perkin\u2019s just way better than George at this song (here) I think the Beatles put more life into it on the BBC CD.Dig it \u2014 There wasn\u2019t much point to including this on the album. It\u2019s a piece of a much bigger improv jam (a version of which can be found here) and never goes anywhere. Of all the \u201cscraps\u201d to come from the Let it Be sessions, why this one was chosen doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.Goodnight \u2014 Ringo does not do a very good job at this song, which is about the last thing you\u2019d expect the Beatles to record. I do wonder, though, if John could have pulled it off in the style of Julia. It was, after all, soft of a lullaby for his son.Kansas City-Hey Hey Hey Hey [Medley] \u2014 The original is superior. I like Paul\u2019s Little Richard imitations, but the Beatles don\u2019t add anything to the song.Personally, there are some songs I just don\u2019t like, but I can see why others like them: Eight Days A Week (the hand-claps drive me nuts)Every Little ThingYou Like Me Too MuchYour Mother Should KnowThe Long and Winding Road (Phil Specter version, too schmaltzy)",

It may be that it rankles most because it appears on Rubber Soul and drags that record down terribly. The American version of Rubber Soul is, to me, a masterpiece (whether the Beatles cared for it or not, the Capitol Records marketing machine actually got something right for once.) And when all the albums were reissued as CDs, I was excited until I saw that Rubber Soul was the English version\u2014missing two songs that I feel worked well on the American RS, but also containing \u201cNowhere Man\u201d (not a bad get) \u201cIf I Needed Someone,\u201d Also not bad, certainly worthy of the rest of the record. I\u2019ve never cared for \u201cDrive My Car\u201d which is not an A-team Beatles song in my opinion, much less a good candidate as a lead-off tune for an otherwise great record, But then you have \u201cWhat Goes On\u201d \u2026 a mess of a thing with little reason to exist than\u2026 except to provide a vehicle for Ringo to sing one in the set. They should have canned \u201cWhat Goes On\u201d completely. Someone else said \u201cDon\u2019t Pass Me By\u201d is the worst and that has a lot sense to it\u2026 it IS badly played and badly recorded and badly produced and badly sung and badly written. But at least it doesn't stand out like a gaping headwound in the very middle of one of the Beatles\u2019 best albums. ",

            "answer_text": "there is an extremely small handful of songs that I don\u2019t like. I have listened to the Beatles since high school(along other 60\u2019s acts such as the rolling stones, doors, jimi hendrix, the who, beach boys and etc). the beatles are probably the only band that I enjoyed about almost 100% of their material. however, there are 6 songs I disliked: Run for your life: the song was poorly played, had lackluster production and it had strange dark lyrics that talk about murder: \u201cI\u2019d rather see you dead little girl than be with another man\u201d. Good Night: I didn\u2019t like this song not because of ringo(ringo starr puts on a really good preformance), its just that it seemed to melancholy. \u201cGood Night\u201d also proves that Ringo\u2019s voice fits in with really sombre or sad tunes. Oh! Darling: Never liked this one because it seemed like the Beatles attempted Screamo nearly 40 years before it was invented. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer: Dark and weird song about a murdering psychopath. I think Paul got really carried away with pop standards, show tunes and so called \u201cgranny songs\u201d. Revolution 9: not really a song per say, but rather a collection of noise the Long Winding road(album version): again, Spector overproduced this track making a sorry mess of a song. there really is no worst Beatles songs. But in my opinion it would have to be run for your life or Revolution 9 ",

            "answer_text": "I have to go with \u201cPiggies.\u201d First of all, it\u2019s a truly dreadful song with awful playing and insipid misanthropic lyrics that attempt to satirize American culture and/or attempt to start some kind of counterculture revolution. It really depends on whether you view the whole thing as an attempt at satire or not. The trouble is it is so boring and heavy-handed, you don\u2019t end up caring. That harpsichord is awful also. Second, Charles Manson was inspired by this song to commit mass murder, showing, if nothing else, that the song has really bad karma. But worst of all is this. According to the Beatles\u2019 associate producer Chris Thomas, Harrison at one point during the song\u2019s recording session broke off playing Piggies and started playing a beautiful melody on the harpsichord. Thomas was enthused and asked Harrison pointedly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do that one instead?\u201d Harrison declined, claiming the song really wasn\u2019t ready, and the recording of Piggies went ahead. The song that Harrison turned down in order to record this monstrous bad version of a high school book report on 1984 was \u2026. \u201cSomething.\u201d Thankfully Harrison later completed \u201cSomething\u201d, which justly became one of the great rock ballads of all time. And to think it almost got scuttled for this . That alone is enough to make \u201cPiggies\u201d my least favorite Beatles song. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Good day Sunshine\u2019 makes my stomach lurch like a train braking to avoid a stalled van. The goopy forced cheerfulness, the soggy sing-along rhythm, the inane lyrics: \u201cI need to laugh, and when the sun is out I\u2019ve got something to laugh about, I feel good, in a special way. I\u2019m in love and it\u2019s a sunny day.\u201d Need to purge? Why bother with a finger when you\u2019ve got something like this at your disposal? Of course music is personal, and as such I\u2019m a bit horrified at the songs folks dislike. Here\u2019s my defense of a few: \u2018Ob La Di Ob La Da\u2019 isn\u2019t a fave, but at least it\u2019s got a little life to it. \u2018Revolution Number Nine\u2019 was an attempt at musical collage. I don\u2019t particularly like it but I\u2019d rather have pretension falling on its face than sugar-dipped daisies hammered into my ear. The serial killer lyrics of \u2018Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u2019 is what makes the song interesting, not its problem. Did you have a childhood? Then how can you hate \u2018Octopuses Garden\u2019 or \u2018Yellow Submarine\u2019? \u2018Run for Your Life\u2019 is a song about a guy with a diseased mind: \u201cWell you know that I\u2019m a wicked guy/and was born with a jealous mind\u201d and as such was not created to to provide spiritual guidance or to offer any relationship advice whatsoever. It\u2019s important to consider context when hearing a song like \u2018Her Majesty\u2019. At the time the world was proclaiming The Beatles to be musical gods; a whole generation waited on their every utterance. From the beginning they showed a willingness to poke fun at themselves, and surely that willingness was a reason they survived such over the top fame. Many don\u2019t. Ending a mind-searing masterpiece with a simple ditty proclaiming an undying love for the Queen and the plaint \u201cI want to tell her I love her a lot but I got to get a belly full of wine\u201d reminds us of their humanity. The Beatles were were constantly dethroning themselves. Unlike other bands I love, Pink Floyd say, The Beatles were determined to include us. What can you say to four boys like that other than thank you? ",

I think \u201cWhen I Get Home\u201d is just horrible. Although its bridge makes me laugh, I don\u2019t think they were trying to make me laugh. It sounds like they were going for some kind of Otis Redding southern soul song; and it\u2019s not that they fail, because failing would be understandable. After all, they were just not that kind of band. It\u2019s that they ALMOST succeed and that is what makes it so terrible. I like the pounding drums and the chunky guitars and it definitely has a cow-bell but the off-key vocals, the silly lyrics and the song just seems framed wrong: it\u2019s melody is uncharacteristically down-played and just doesn\u2019t work. If it had been 1965 they would have recut it it with a totally different arrangement, I think.\u201cHold Me Tight.\u201d I don\u2019t really know if the song is bad, per se \u2014 Phil Spector\u2019s version actually turned it into an enjoyable piece of throwaway pop; but the performance/production is wretched. Off-key, almost bored-sounding vocals, annoying handclaps, a slagging tempo. It\u2019s chugging intro sounds good for about five seconds but the track goes steadily downhill from there.One of the great things about the Beatles is that they almost always all seem to be giving 100%. But not on this song.\u201cYou Like Me Too Much.\u201d Like everything they did, it\u2019s not completely horrid. I like the piano/organ intro and the guitar/piano solo. But geez. That bridge that starts \u201cI really do\u2026\u201dmay be the most bored any major band has ever sounded on anything.. \u201cWild Honey Pie\u201d. One of the great things about the White Album is that, in context, the sequencing of the album is such that even totally annoying pieces of grating avant-pop like this one sound kind of cool. This is the sound of babies being put through meat grinders, like in that Pink Floyd video.\u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer.\u201d It\u2019s got all the elements of a good song: clever lyrics, an inventive arrangement, good production and performance from all involved, a cracking lead guitar and even a cool moog synth solo. They worked so hard on this that I feel almost guilty about relegating to Sucksville, but that\u2019s where it goes.",

            "answer_text": "So many people adding such lengthy answers about the objectivity of their catalogue and how a bad song can\u2019t be real because someone might like it. I\u2019ll lay it down for you, the Beatles had 13 albums and over 200 songs. There\u2019s bound to be something bad in there. I personally think the worst of it comes from two albums: The White Album and Let it Be. I know they\u2019re more stripped back albums, and lots of people genuinely love the White Album and think it\u2019s the Beatles best work, but you have to admit there\u2019s a lot of filler on that one. Wild Honey Pie is a hot piece of garbage. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Paul. I love him more than I love probably any other celebrity or figure in music. This song just ain\u2019t it though. I really like Why Don\u2019t We Do it in the Road. That song at least has some bite to it and is kind of edgy, but Wild Honey Pie is just a bunch of noise. I wouldn\u2019t even call it inventive just because it\u2019s so weird. I genuinely hate it whenever it comes on. Revolution 9 is so bad I don\u2019t think anybody even considers it a song. This song terrifies me. If you listen to Revolution 9 at night in the dark, it\u2019s an experience in and of itself. I get scared that I\u2019ll turn on the light and John and Yoko will be staring right at me with wicked smiles on their faces. I know some people actually like this \u201csong\u201d, but I can\u2019t imagine why that is. It\u2019s just a bunch of self indulgent noise that we all wish could be erased from the Beatles catalogue. Everything else on the White Album goes from passable to downright amazing. Maggie Mae bothers me because it\u2019s not even a finished song. It\u2019s really just a jam session that got cut short and made it on the Let it Be album. That song belongs on one of the Anthology albums and thats it. It\u2019s a shame too because I actually like the song (even though it\u2019s a cover) and if they had taken the time to actually do it right it would be pretty good. There\u2019s really no wonder why it was omitted from Let it Be\u2026Naked. Everything else on Let it Be is pretty good but could have been recorded better (and I think Phil Spectors work on it wasn\u2019t good and that Paul was right to make Let it Be\u2026Naked to show how it could have been. Spectors version of the Long and Winding Road is just too busy and not emotional enough for me. When Paul sings \u201clong and winding rooooad\u201d and then BAM the orchestra comes in, it catches me by surprise and just feels too loud. I hate it). I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more that could be added but those three songs to me just barely count as songs at all but were still released as if they were. If they never existed, the world would be no different (except for maybe Revolution 9 but I\u2019d argue the world would be better if it was Yesterday\u2019d and everyone forgot about it). If you want my opinion on songs that are generally liked that I don\u2019t really enjoy and have an unpopular opinion on, I don\u2019t think \u201cRain\u201d is that good even though everyone loves it, but even then I wouldn\u2019t consider it a bad song. It all really comes down to personal taste. ",

Here\u2019s five that just don\u2019t cut the mustard: \u201cI Wanna Be Your Man\u201d\u2014Ringo needed a solo track on each early album, but the song is a tedious throwaway, and Lennon/McCartney had superior material sitting around that would\u2019ve worked much better. It isn\u2019t horrible\u2014it\u2019s just dull.\u201cIf You\u2019ve Got Troubles\u201d\u2014unissued for many years, this is another sub-standard original given to Ringo. It\u2019s a mess, and it was wise of the group not to issue it.\u201cThe Night Before\u201d\u2014a below-par song tossed off for the \u201cHelp!\u201d movie, this is a regressive piece that sounds more like something Gerry Marsden would have written (he of Gerry & the Pacemakers, a lightweight Liverpool beat group). From any other group, it would seem okay; from the Beatles, it\u2019s strictly mehs-ville.\u201cThat Means a Lot\u201d\u2014a coy, pretentious McCartney song that is overfull of clever, hey-looka-me chord changes. It\u2019s ambitious, but it doesn\u2019t gel. The band was, again, wise to shelve this one and move on to better things.\u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d/\u201dOb-La-Di\u201d\u2014I may hate the latter a bit more, but both songs are examples of the air-headed side of Paul McCartney, and if I never hear either again, my life will be that much better.",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t Pass Me By is pretty bad, but it does give us interesting lyrics. I have always thought that the clues about Paul being dead were only half of the story\u2026 that nearly always they were followed up by lyrics that let us know he came back to life\u2026 as Jesus did\u2026 Remember Jesus? They were torched for supposedly thinking they were better than Jesus\u2026 So what would four guys do about that accusation and all the crap they had to go through for John\u2019s off-hand comment? I think what they did was they hid things in their lyrics that hinted at Paul died and came back to life\u2026 So when Ringo sings, \u201cYou were in a car crash and you lost your hair.\u201d he follows that up with, \u201cYou said that you would be late\u2026 about an hour or two\u2026 I said, \u2018that\u2019s all right I\u2019m waiting here, just waiting to hear from you.\u201d Another one I really loved because I had this theory before the song came out, was \u201cHe blew his mind out in a car. He didn\u2019t notice that the lights had changed.\u201d That was pointed out as being more clues that Paul was dead. However, it was followed up by \u201cNobody was really sure if he was from the House Of Lords.\u201d Then, of course, Mother Mary came to Paul, right? Another little clue that could indicate they were making Paul a Christ figure came at the end of \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d You can hear the melody of \u201cWhat Child Is This?\u201d fading out at the end of the song. Paul and the rest of the Beatles on Abbey Road are walking AWAY from the grave yard. There are other clues. It just makes sense to me that these guys would have lashed back at the angry world for being so unfairly maligned, and what better way to do that than to embed clues in their songs? But I digress. Don\u2019t Pass Me By is not a good song, but it doesn\u2019t hurt the side of the album. It\u2019s a silly sing a long type ditty. However, it has way more substance than \u201cYour Mother Should Know\u201d\u2026 I have no idea how Paul got the Beatles to do that horrible video of that song. It\u2019s almost sad to see them all having no fun whatsoever during that thing. So, long story/short, my vote is for \u201cYour Mother Should Know.\u201d ",

The breadth of vision is, of course, why The Beatles are the greatest band of all time. If George and John had had their way of being more rock the Beatles would have collapsed into a more narrow beast like most other bands.

I used to do music concrete for fun as a teenager so love Revolutiion #9 because it\u2019s not a song of course - it\u2019s a proper bit of mid to late 60s experimentalism.

There are other Beatles songs I don\u2019t like much but these are the ones that I always press \u201cskip\u201d when I am playing the cd. Revolution 9 Over 40 years I have tried. really tried to find some merit in it but no, to me it is just a self indulgent noise. Mr Moonlight The opening scream by Lennon is fantastic. Then it becomes this Bosa Nova song that I can imagine being used in the background of a 1960s TV programme like the Saint to show that he is in some club somewhere abroad. When I\u2019m 64 Surely THE low point of Sgt Pepper\u2019s. This so called revolutionary psychedelic album dips into a novelty song about being 64 with Paul\u2019s voice speeded up to make him younger. I first this heard when I was about 10 and loved it. Then I grew up! Hold me Close Just sluggish and Paul is really out of tune in some places Till There Was You A very obvious attempt to repeat the formula of A Taste of Honey from the previous album. The \u201cBeatles as all round entertainers \u201c on middle of the road tv programmes at the time. I didn\u2019t include Maggie Mae as its so short its over by the time I find the remote! ",

Just appalling schmaltz. I may begrudgingly admit that John and Paul do some nice two-part harmonies, but the song is terrible. Even the boys themselves used to make fun of it when they played it live, sometimes introducing it as If I Fell Over.From their middle period: Blue Jay Way (from Magical Mystery Tour). A dismal dirge of a song. I can literally find nothing positive to say about this track whatsoever.From their late period: The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill (from the White Album). On an album with a number of low points, this track stands out for how crap it is. It sounds like a bunch of people messing around in the studio, throwing something together in a few minutes of free time for their own amusement. No one else should have ever been made to listen to it.",

            "answer_text": "In general, I am a big fan of the entire Beatles catalogue, and the shear diversity of their song styles and genres only makes me appreciate them more. That said, one of their songs annoys the crap out of me every time I hear it, and always has \u2013 \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road?\u201d When I was young, the song was controversial in the conservative area where I lived because of the straightforward sexual connotation. That has never bothered me. What irritates me about the \u201csong\u201d is that it\u2019s nothing more than repeating the exact same \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road?\u201d phrase 15 times, interrupted by also repeating \u201cNo one will be watching us\u201d 3 times, for 1:46. This poor excuse for a song particularly galls me because it\u2019s not by some band known for churning out pointless, empty crap \u2013 as many do \u2013 it\u2019s by the band that put out brilliantly lyrical storytelling like Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day In The Life, Eleanor Rigby, She\u2019s Leaving Home, and Nowhere Man, as well as thought-provoking songs like Tomorrow Never Knows, Blackbird, Help!, and Hey Jude, and uplifting classics like All You Need is Love, Here Comes the Sun, Here There and Everywhere, The End, etc., etc., etc. After all of that and more, \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road?\u201d doesn\u2019t come close to measuring up lyrically, musically, or attitudinally.

It\u2019s testament to the Beatles\u2019 greatness that in a short career they generated a huge catalogue of recordings covering a wide range of styles from pure pop to the avant-garde, with very few duffs. Some tracks probably shouldn\u2019t have made it to the relevant album. Maggie Mae, the traditional Liverpool sailor\u2019s song I always imagine the lads singing after a few bevvies in the Grapes following a Cavern gig, perhaps, but that\u2019s what happens when you work with Phil Spector. That was always going to end in tears. But it follows Let It Be, which wasn\u2019t intended to be their epitaph but in practice it was, and the snippet links the epitaph back to their origins, which on reflection is a piece of brilliance on Spector\u2019s part. The two tracks should have ended the album though; it works best if you switch the two sides round. (interesting that the \u201cofficial\u201d epitaph is capped by an accidental snippet too, though not one as significant as this one. In retrospect I think the most regrettable Beatles song is Run For Your Life. ",

I would feel so embarrassed to recommend this song to new listeners, the lyrics are so dumb and repetitive, and even tune is pretty mediocre. I feel like in hell, they may play this song to torture sinners. The worst part is that this song has 100m+ views on Youtube and 74m+ plays on Spotify. The popularity of this is annoying, so much views and plays to an objectively mediocre song. ",

It sounded beautiful but out of place in first hearing, then the beauty quickly faded while it remains out of place.

Of the main Beatle LP releases perhaps songs such as Why Don't We Do It In The Road or Don't Pass Me By from the White album would rate lowly in any Beatles opinion poll as they were included probably as \"making up numbers\" for that largely fine album. Some people might argue that George Harrison's contributions on Revolver (Love You Too) and Sergeant Pepper (Within You And Without You) were not as stylistically effective as the other songs on those respective albums.

Even the worst of the rest is still good music. For me personally, some of the most highly acclaimed and beautiful songs they ever recorded are the songs I skip over. Maybe it\u2019s because they were so overplayed, or maybe it\u2019s just me because these are indeed great songs. I\u2019m speaking of songs like The Long and Winding Road, Hey Jude, Let It Be, and yes, even Yesterday. Note that the first three were all Phil Specter productions which I think is more than coincidence. Reading other answers, I am surprised to see some songs named that I genuinely like\u2026\u2026 Glass Onion, Maxwell\u2019s, Octopus\u2019 Garden, and Piggies among others. ",

Their sense of humor is one of the things I love about them, along with their willingness to experiment. Sure, not all of their experiments succeeded, but that\u2019s just how it works. And it was the \u201860s. So while I don\u2019t hold their failed experiments against them, I do have to acknowledge that they were flops. There are very few of their songs that I just plain don\u2019t like, so this will be a rather short list. In no particular order: Run for Your Life. Musically, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s catchy. Lyrically, I just can\u2019t get behind the misogyny. Revolution 9. This was their experiment that fell flat. It was an interesting novelty the first few listens, but these days I tend to skip it more often than not when it comes up in the rotation. What\u2019s the New Mary Jane? I think they were going somewhere with it musically, but the lyrics only drag it down further. Honorable mention: She\u2019s a Woman. I disliked the dissonant chords when I was younger, although it\u2019s grown on me somewhat, kind of like how bitter-flavored things become more palatable with age. ",

On the other hand, many of the songs mentioned in other responses are songs I really enjoy! In many of them the boys are stretching out a bit and trying something new.

Even though I'm not the world's biggest Beatles fan, I also think most of their songs have something to offer, and I consider I Saw Her Standing There one of the greatest pop songs ever written. That said, I nominate You Know My Name (Look Up The Number), which I, like other youth of my generation, first heard by flipping over the 45 for Let It Be. What an epic disappointment. A few minutes of fucking around that someone decided to call a song because hey, they were the Beatles, and they were breaking up anyway. ",

So, it seems I'm alone in this, but I'd pick \u201cPaperback Writer\u201d as my least favorite. I don't know why. I just never liked the way their voices sounded on this one and while the lyrics are clever enough, they don't do anything for me. I also don't like \u201cSavoy Truffle\u201d from the \u201cWhite Album.\u201d Who needs a song about desserts? Finally, I haven't heard this song in years because it was on a collection I only had on cassette, but \u201cOld Brown Shoe\u201d is up there, too. I was sick in high school while this song went through my head repeatedly, so feeling awful and this song have always been inextricably and inexplicably linked. ",

Any charm it may have had is ruined by being so truncated that it verges on meaninglessness. The only thing I like about it is a high-pitched John Lennon saying \u201cHark, the Angels Come\u201d at the end, which I\u2019ll admit is the perfect segue into \u201cLet It Be\u201d. Even \u201cMaggie Mae\u201d (which seems to be pretty unpopular from other answers to this question) is a complete performance of its arrangement. \u201cDig It\u201d doesn\u2019t even come in with any context. I know Glyn Johns intended for a longer excerpt of the jam to be released on Get Back, and perhaps I\u2019d appreciate that extension, but in Spector\u2019s edit, there\u2019s no point for \u201cDig It\u201d.
