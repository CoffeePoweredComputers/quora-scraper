            "answer_text": "On average, yes. They appear to be alit more happier from my experience dealing with my friends which most of them have been single almost their whole life. They do what they want, they make tons more money than I do working in the same industry, and buy what they want. Me and my gf has been in a relationship for 7 years and its beginning to take a toll on me. Ir it takes a lot of work and effort than you may think to keep a spouse satisfied with no complaints. Relationships do have advantages but they can't even compare to the many more advantages of being single. Most relationships don't work out and people usually have to keep trying and trying until they meet the perfect person. To me, relationships aren't worth it. Single is wayyy better. And you don't have to be lonely. My single friends have me and I have them. Of course they have other friends besides me. One of my single guy friends dates a new girl every week it seems like and he brags about having all the good sex he wants. There was this hispanic girl he had sex with a while ago that like seriously wanted to marry him. She really caught feelings for him. ",

What people don\u2019t realize is being happy in relationships and being happy single are TWO DIFFERENT SKILL SETS. WHAT\u2026.? Yes. I said skill sets. The American dream is built on the foundation of happily ever after and an inborn undying need to provide and care for others in every capacity FORVER. But others don\u2019t give a fuck about ALL THAT. (Believe it or not). People who are relationship driven, are relationship driven. They think family is king, forgive like a sucker, love unconditionally (like a sucker) and are loyal to others almost to a tragic lunacy. (But it looks sweet right)? People who are genuinely happy being single FOCUS on the WORLD. They want to scour, adore and explore every inch of it while helping solve its problems along the way. People in relationships excel at and are happy nurturing and providing service to people. People who are perpetually happy being single excel at nurturing external issues and ideas and are best at serving the bigger picture. \ud83d\udea8 Of course it\u2019s not 100% all or nothing - so no semantics police. Examples of Semantics: A toy block could be called a block, a cube, a toy. \ud83d\ude02 ",

            "answer_text": "It boils down to each individual. I don\u2019t know too much about relationship partners, I can only tell you that what we do need as a minimum is a few genuine friends and ourselves. I\u2019d think to tell you that, no, that it may be impossible, because I\u2019d be thinking of the long-term. If you think that you can picture your 70-year old self, sitting alone in a couch with yourself, then I can\u2019t say much to that. Think that you will live up to a point, and that point will eventually be becoming old and alone. You will live alone. I don\u2019t think anyone really wants that, but it\u2019s up to you to know. Now, if you\u2019re asking about the present during your youth or adulthood, then, sure. It is absolutely possible. Not everyone is in need to be in a relationship, some people genuinely feel better without a partner and can just settle with their friends. We are all humans with hard-wired similarities, but we don\u2019t all have the same needs. If you\u2019re asking for your own self, I\u2019d have to tell you that it won\u2019t matter how many people you ask or how many answers you get. By the end of it all, all you need to do is ask one person, yourself, and he/she will hold all the answers which will be right for you. When you ask a question, more often than not, people will tell you things from their own personal needs. If someone can\u2019t live without a partner, they may insist that you can\u2019t live without one. It\u2019s absolutely possible to be happy without one, but it\u2019s up to you to decide what would make you a little happier. ",

I think not all the single people are happy most of the time they feel lonely because they have no one to share their feelings and thoughts. Sometimes when they see their friends are busy with their partners that time single people also wish that there would be someone in their life too. Someone who make them feel like they are also important so much in someone's life. Someone who is ready to do anything for them. So I don't think single people are mostly happy and also I think happiness is matter of satisfaction with your life. ",

            "answer_text": "This is more complex than it sounds. Married people are generally happier than single people, but long-time surveys show that they were already happier than average before they married. Happiness among women varies significantly more within marriage, with those in bad marriages being unhappy and those in good marriages being happy. Men are more generally happy in their marriage, and deeply unhappy after a divorce. Many divorced women are happy, but some of these still choose to marry again at a later time. Married couples who have a child usually experience a reduction in happiness that lasts for many years. They are still happier than unmarried parents. Interestingly, cohabiting couples tend to fall in between singles and married couples on the scale of happiness. It is unlikely that it is the actual wedding ritual that confers happiness, rather it seems that certain sets of the population are more likely to marry, others are more likely to cohabit without marriage, and others again more likely to remain functionally single.

Also sometimes it\u2019s good when you hug someone it makes your stress level lower and you have protected sex. Also Soup when you are sick.
