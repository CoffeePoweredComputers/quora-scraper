            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take a different approach than the other answers by referring to the pipe organ. The lowest note on a large organ is a 32\u2032 low C on the pedal with a frequency of ~16Hz, a sound that can be felt more than heard. The highest note on some organs is a C7 played on a 1\u2032 stop. This has a frequency of ~16000Hz (which most of us over the age of 60 can\u2019t hear or feel!). This is 10 full octaves and it covers the full range of music. Note that the Atlantic City Convention Center organ has 2 ranks of pipes that go down to 8Hz. But I don\u2019t think that any music has been written to take advantage of those subsonic frequencies! ",

            "answer_text": "Music is like math; everything exists in an ideal state, so you can write down as many notes above or below middle C as you\u2019d like. Now what people can actually play depends on their instrument and ability but as far as the abstract musical piece, if you write down 703 lines above the staff, that note is in your piece and it exists as music.
