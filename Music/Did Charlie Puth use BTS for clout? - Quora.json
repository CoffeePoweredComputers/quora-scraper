            "answer_text": "Clout.  Charlie was already an established western artist by the time they collaborated with him. So do i think he used BTS for clout, as in influence or power? No. I don\u2019t. I think it was a good business move. I think it helped BTS spread their influence in the western market. And maybe also spread Charlie\u2019s music in the Asian market. I also think it was something members wanted to do. Some of them liked Charlie\u2019s music. A collaboration was agreed upon. It happened. I don\u2019t even know why this is still even an issue. Even if Charlie was an unknown artist and BTS decided to collaborate with him, isn\u2019t that their decision to make? Don\u2019t people trust them as artists to make decisions about their own careers? Not everybody is trying to ride the coattails of BTS. Sometimes decisions are made because they are good business moves, sometimes it\u2019s because it satisfies members personal interests and goals. Whatever the reason, they know what they\u2019re doing. ",

BTS used Charlie to expand themselves into the western audiences that probably haven't heart of KPOP before and Charlie used BTS to be more known on the East and connect with the young audience that BTS has on the West. These are business moves that can be very fun for artist (for example Jungkook has been a big fan of Charlie Puth for years) and fans get more content. ARMY, stop worrying so much, BigHit and the boys themselves know what they are doing. ",

He's such a big fanboy of him. So if Charlie DID use them, then it was a very ominous act. Maybe media forced him to, which does happen, but it still wouldn't make the situation better. ",
