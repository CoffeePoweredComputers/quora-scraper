            "answer_text": "I think the general consensus you will find among Drake fans is that Take Care and Nothing Was The Same are Drake\u2019s best albums. Take Care is usually the one people regard as his all-time best, as someone else mentioned. The album really solidified Drake\u2019s takeover in the Hip-Hop industry and was one of the main staples in the developing his sound on his momentous run the past nine years. It\u2019s tough to go with one over the other as they are both terrific albums. In general, Nothing Was The Same is more of an actual \u2018Hip-Hop/Rap\u2019 album (Tuscan Leather, The Language, Worst Behavior, Started From The Bottom), whereas Take Care included more R&B elements. (Practice, Shot For Me, Doing it Wrong, Crew Love) However, they are both very well rounded, with NTWS being slightly more cohesive I think. As far as his other albums go, they are all pretty solid in my opinion. Although, What A Time To Be Alive seemed more like a fun mixtape Drake and Future decided to throw together in a weekend rather than an actual album. I rarely listen to that project\u2026 I think most Drake fans would agree that IYRTITL, Views, and More Life were solid, entertaining projects with numerous gems, but they probably can\u2019t overtake Nothing Was The Same or Take Care. And of course not to forget about his debut album, Thank Me Later, which is also very solid in its own right. But, I just don\u2019t think it can match up with the two after it. ",

            "answer_text": "Mine would have to be a mix between Take Care and Nothing Was The Same. But then I thought about it some more. I mean I am a pretty big Drake Fan and I really don\u2019t claim to be fans of that many people. I\u2019ve been listening to Drake since 2006 when I first heard Successful due to listening to a lot of Trey Songz music at the time. As soon as I heard it I was like he\u2019s the next one. I did the same with Kanye and Jay-Z. So I didn\u2019t want to leave it up to a mixed double album rating so I decided to then go ahead and rate each song on each album and then tabulate an actual score based off of those ratings. But then when I tabulated the scores I realized it appeared that Nothing Was The Same had a lot higher Score than Take Care even though I preferred the amount of Rap on Take Care as opposed to the mixture of rap and singing that he provided on Nothing Was The Same. And then I realized that I probably have more positive feelings for Nothing Was The Same due to the fact that it only came out 4.5 years ago compared to Take Care that came out like 7 years ago. Then for a millisecond I thought about If You\u2019re Reading This, What A Time and More Life and even Views. Sorry You Can Thank Me Later .. you\u2019re just way too old. And due to me doing a drastic dash for Drake Music before his first album I basically made my own Drake mixtapes based off all the songs he had between his original mixtapes so I couldn\u2019t even answer the best mixtape question if it was asked. Unfortunately after all that tabulating I still wasn\u2019t able to come up with a better album. They were both masterpieces. They both had songs that got me through some really personal times. The little of bit of praise I was going to give to NWTS I had to actually lessen due to it have 20 minutes less material than Take Care. So there you have it, my first sentence said it all. ",
