            "answer_text": "Make sure your FL Studio version is at least the $200 Producer Edition or you won\u2019t be able to record at all. You want to first assign your microphone to a track in your mixer. To do this, go to your mixer and select a track that is NOT your master track. In the part of the track that contains your plugins, look for the input tab and select a mono input(mono just means one microphone in this case). Now it should say something like \u201cInput 1\u201d or something similar. After this, just arm the track that you assigned the microphone to and then arm to record(it\u2019s to the right of the stop button). Now when you have the project armed to record, it will always record your armed tracks. ",
