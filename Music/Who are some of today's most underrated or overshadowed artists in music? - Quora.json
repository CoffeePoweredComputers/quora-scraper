            "answer_text": "May not be your genre, but I grew up in Atlanta, and most of the popular hip-hop and rap that you hear ( per say 21 Savage or Future ) came with like a couple good mix tapes in the beginning but then now there just blathering on and on and on about the same stuff and repeating the same words. I think definitely the most overshadowed and possibly the some of the most underrated artists in that particular genre would be like the guys I grew up and went to school with who could hit a verse as fast as Busta Rhymes but never got listened to and got shut down by the guys with all the cash in the booths.

            "answer_text": "In terms of pure creativity, showmanship, and talent, I can\u2019t think of anyone that tops Shakey Graves, so it always surprises me to find that many people have never heard of him. Guy can do it all: plays guitar like no one else, sings with an incredible tone and range, and plays a kick drum and tambourine with his feet while doing so. He\u2019s also an impressive lyricist and songwriter, and has all but invented a genre of his own, playing at the intersection of southern rock, country, bluegrass, and punk. A couple of a my favorite tracks include Tomorrow, Late July, Roll the Bones, If Not for You, Dearly Departed, but he many other great tracks. Give him a listen! ",
