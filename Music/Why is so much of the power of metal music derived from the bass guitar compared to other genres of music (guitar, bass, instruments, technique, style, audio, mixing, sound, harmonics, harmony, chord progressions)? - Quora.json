            "answer_text": "Adding to what others have said, as with other genres, bass \u201cglues\u201d the guitar and drums together - but in metal the bass often uses a more aggressive tone and goes lower (either with 5 string or downtuning). Another thing is that the lowest frequencies of the bass guitar go lower than the kick drums(s), which in tandem with the kick drum(s) in metal often emphasising the \u201cclick\u201d sound, leaves more space for the bass guitar to be heard/felt.

            "answer_text": "Bass is the backbone of almost every genre of music, not just metal. If fact, even some top 40s songs have incredible bass lines that you\u2019re average bass player would have trouble playing. Without those bass lines the song would not have any groove. Most metal music (At least the stuff I play and listen to) is ALL about the groove. The drums and the bass set that groove and everything else is written around it to \u201cdress it up\u201d. ",
