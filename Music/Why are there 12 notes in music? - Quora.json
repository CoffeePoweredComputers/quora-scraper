            "answer_text": "Historical (though not illogical). Using two observations from Ancient Times. First, octave equivalence: notes an octave apart sound similar. Second, many things that vibrate (strings, flutes, but not bells) have a second note at 3/2 the frequency (or 3/2 \u201chigher\u201d in Ancient Times before frequency measurements were easy). Compounding these two intervals gives a sequence of 3/2, 9/4,\u2026 Twelve of these sound a lot like 7 compounded octaves. Approximately (3/2)^12 is close to 2^ 7. Other systems exist (Harry Partch, 53-note division of the octave, etc.) ",
