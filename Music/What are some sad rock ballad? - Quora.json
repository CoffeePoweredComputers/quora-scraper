            "answer_text": "The Quora Moderators have asked me to improve my credentials for this answer. Play guitar and Bass. Learned music composition and songwriting. Played in a guitar duo where I needed to learn fingerpicking and slide. Performed as a solo act reciting my poetry to guitar chord accompaniment. Performed in school and church plays. Sang in the Church choir. Fan of Elvis, Roy Orbison, Beatles, Beach Boys, CCR. Love the Blues. Love most genres of music (not Punk or Rap. Sorry). I hope this helps. Thanks for the views.
