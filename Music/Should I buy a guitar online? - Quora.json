            "answer_text": "Hi, In my honest opinion you should prefer to buy a guitar offline in a nearby dealer in your locality. There are pros and cons related to both method. Here are pros and cos from both the practises. Offline : PROS : You get to witness and experience the guitar which you are eventually going to purchase which is the best reason for offline purchaseIf you are familiar or friends with the offline dealer , you might be able to avail the product at a much lower rate.There is a higher assurance and guarantee that the product is authenticCONS : You might not be able to get the exact model you are looking forward to purchaseIt might take some more time to order and purchase the guitar from the manufacturerOnline : PROS : All guitar models would be available through some dealer or the otherCashback and offers would be higher for all modelsCONS : We wouldn't be guaranteed of the model and it's authenticity unless it is a highly recommended and an excellent dealer.We wouldn't be able to experience the guitar aforehand.That being said , both have their ups and downs. Personally I would recommend that you purchase the guitar offline by placing a purchase online and getting it from the manufacturer though it might cost some more bucks. Hope this answers your question. Have a nice day. Cheers Regards E M ",

            "answer_text": "I got my first guitar offline and i recently bought a guitar online(because i am experienced enough to judge what ill be getting for the money im paying). If you're buying your first guitar, buy it offline. Why? Because you don't know what you want at this stage. When you're starting to learn guitar, it's very important that you are comfortable with the instrument you're playing. Guitars comes in different shapes and sizes and types. Hold the guitar and with your left hand, feel and compare the neck of all the guitar there is in the shop. Everyone doesn't have the same hands so do the thickness of the guitar neck. You wouldn't want to buy one that's not built for you.Although all guitars may sound the same to you at this stage. Try and compare the sounds the guitar makes. Different sizes of the guitar mean different sounds it will make. Go for the one that sounds like the type of music you would hear and play.Other factors include in buying a guitar but like i said, if you're starting out, buy it offline. And remember to take someone experienced with you so that you can make the best decision. ",
