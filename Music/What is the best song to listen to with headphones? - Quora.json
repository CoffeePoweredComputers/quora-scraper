            "answer_text": "There are many, with respect to your preference, I\u2019d like to suggest the following track for getting an approximation of the limits of your cans: 1. Johnny Cash \u2013 Man in Black If you know anything about Johnny Cash, then you can imagine that Escape is on the heavy side. This track is raw and simple, the instruments are easy to differentiate and the vocals are rich. The song is wonderfully rich from beginning to end, and it makes for a great testing song.  2. Don't Bring Me Down \u2013 ELO There is another track which is helping you to test your headphone sound stage; this band will definitely help you do that. The drums on this song are exquisite and super energizing, so this song is a great way to see how your Bluetooth headphones make the sound stand out above everything else.  3. Caribbean Blue \u2013 Enya New age music is not everyone\u2019s thing, but you don\u2019t have to be a fan to appreciate the layering of this piece. If your Bluetooth headphones don\u2019t convey the ethereal layers of sound this song features, then you should move on to other options.  4. Baba O\u2019Riley \u2013 The Who This incredible song is also a great way to test your headphone\u2019s right to left balance as it moves from one side to the other in an amazing way. The intro drowns you with sound only to fade into an amazing guitar effects, strong drum and bass, which you want to listen again and again.  5. Insane in the Membrane \u2013 Cypress Hill The beat is soo catchy. You probably should listen to this song several times in a row as a part of a good bass test.  6. Silent Lucidity \u2013 Queensryche This classic rock track has a nice variety of elements that will good to listen your headphone. If your device is working fine, you should hear nice and crisp vocals at the beginning, then it continue with a crisp guitar sound and around the 2:00 minute, you should see a clear chorus of voices.  7. Radiohead \u2014 \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d This is a great song to start off your headphone . There\u2019s a mix of acoustic and electric instruments, as well as spacey effects panned all across the headphone spectrum \u2014 and all of these elements should be distinctly audible. It starts off with a fun laser sound which can give you an idea if you can hear high, textured sounds, and then it goes right into a distorted bass guitar.  8. Mastodon, \u201cThe Czar\u201d This is one case where a song not only sounds great under headphones, but the sprawling arrangement almost makes more sense. In fact, that description applies to almost every track on Mastodon\u2019s underrated 2009 progressive metal masterpiece, Crack the Skye.  These all tracks are really best for listening headphone.Of course, you\u2019re free to play around with the playlist and add more songs that you think will challenge your headphones. The point of the playlist is to give you an idea of what you should look for. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a little old school, so my answer is based on the music I grew up with. I don't pay any attention to anything that came out after the early 80\u2032s. Sorry, but to me, the styles of music went downhill after that. I was an audiophile, so I spent a lot of money on my sound system. But ocassionally I would don the headphones to drown out the rest of the world. I have 2 songs that always come to mind when I think back to those times. First, and by far the best, was \u201c Welcome to the Machine\u201d by Pink Floyd. This song was recorded with the left and right channels so distinct my eyes would go back and forward as each sound was produced. Near the end, a sound started on one side and a split second later reproduced on the other side. Used to blow me away ( drugs didn't hurt). The other was \u201cFuneral for a Friend\u201d by Elton John. Not as sharp as the Pink Floyd song, but I can still hear the music traveling side to side on this great track. There is no way that I\u2019ve come close to hearing every song out there, but these 2 songs have always stuck out as the best I know of. ",
