            "answer_text": "Sometimes people call it indie pop or twee or emo-pop-it's kind of an evolution of punk to its antithesis. Soft voices, soft guitars, not a lot of production, no synths, real drums. Try listening to Belle and Sebastian, gentle waves, the field mice, camera obscura, the magnetic waves. There used to be a series of podcasts called\u201d indiepop radio podcasts\u201d No.1\u201314 that you could get on iTunes that had great stuff that I never heard anywhere else. A lot of the group are Scottish, though it's not an exclusively Scottish thing. They tend to be inspired by \u201ckinder gentler\u201d music from the 60s-Donovan, the Byrds, The Hollies. Also listen to later groups like World Party and the Mondays. Also worth hearing, The Free Design-The ultimate \u201ckinder gentler\u201d pop band. Hope this is what you're looking for :-) ",
