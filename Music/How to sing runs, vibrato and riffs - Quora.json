            "answer_text": "You need good, solid vocal technique before you try adding stylistic choices to your singing.  The recommendation is always to first find a great local voice teacher so they can evaluate your technical skills. Runs and riffs require agility.  You can learn vocabulary like glissando and melisma and pentatonic scale on the way to expanding your ability to control your vocals.  If you are using correct technique, vibrato can naturally happen in your voice, or you can keep a straight tone if you want to choose it for stylistic purposes.  Voice Lessons To The World  by Justin Stoney has quick lessons for all of these things.  I have watched them all. I found these while searching online before I started singing lessons a couple of years ago, and Justin Stoney is a personable, enthusiastic teacher with not only great singing chops but a great way of explaining and demonstrating vocal techniques, allowing the viewer to train their ears to hear the difference. From what I've been learning from my own teacher, I can confirm that what he teaches is absolutely correct.  You will learn terminology and mental understanding of technique. However, you do need somebody to see and hear you, personally, because it takes expert ears to help you while you slowly train your own ears and your body to recognize sensations when you're doing things correctly.  You don't want to train incorrectly and reinforce or build new poor habits that can damage your voice.  Watching these is not sufficient, a teacher is needed so that they can help you feel the vocal coordinations as the air moves in your head and neck. As for finding a local teacher, Justin Stoney has one of the podcasts on how to find a great local teacher and what to look for.  As for local or not, my teacher offers Skype lessons, and Justin Stoney's New York Vocal Coaching team also offers Skype lessons.  So if you can't find someone locally, you may be able to Skype your lesson with lots of different vocal coaches, if you have a strong network connection for video, because a teacher needs to see how you sing in addition to hearing you - a lot of poor techniques are visual as well as audible.

            "answer_text": "It may sound weird but to be able to master the techniques you are striving for, in my humble opinion, it is by bringing those goals into your experience. Anything and everything that deals with those goals - check them out. Think about those Olympic athletes that train all their lifetime in pursuit of their goals. They have totally immersed themselves in the experience to be and/or being an Olympian. That is an extreme example and I wouldn't suggest taking on a commitment like that. But Research, get informed, get training, practice, search for tools, websites, singing groups, singing contests and bring those techniques into your experience for the next 6 months and evaluate yourself and see what needs work. You will see the results of your efforts. Good luck. ",
