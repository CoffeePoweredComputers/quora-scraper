            "answer_text": "Hillsong Worship is the albums and songs used by the main Sunday church at Hillsong Church, Baulkum Hills, Sydney Australia. Back in the time when I was there (~2001 - 2005) there was a little bit of overlap, but the Hillsong United guys were the band that played in the Youth services on Friday Nights, and the Hillsong Worship guys were the band that played in the Sunday Morning church services. the Worship label tends to be geared toward the 30 to 70 year old demographic, whereas Hillsong United tends to be geared toward the 20-somethings and teenage demographic. Specific members of the Hillsong United team will be involved in Hillsong Worship, but many of the older members of the Hillsong Worship team won\u2019t be in the Hillsong United team. Back in the ancient history of 2004, it essentially meant that Hillsong United was fronted by Joel Houston (Brian\u2019s son) with large helpings of Nigel Hendroff on Guitar, while Hillsong Worship was fronted by Darlene Czech. The fact that Nigel was sitting there on Guitar is more testament to how much time Nigel spent at church, than any fusion of the bands. That said, most of the Hillsong United guys would end up at least doing something with Hillsong Worship. Even for the album. Certainly the \u201c2 separate bands\u201d were more like 1 music team during the day to day running of the Church, except of course Hillsong United would often go on Tour, whereas Hillsong Worship guys not in the United team were more likely to stay at home, making the weekly church services continue as per normal while Joel and friends would send video updates from weird and wonderful places around the world, being absent from Thursday Night practice and the weekend church services because they were too busy \u201cBeing in London\u201d or \u201cBeing in Los Angeles\u201d or something while the 30+ year old musicians stayed in Sydney.

            "answer_text": "Judging just from listening to both, it seems like Hillsong Worship is more \u201cserious\u201d and traditional style worship music a la Michael W Smith. The music is more grounded in a \u201ctraditional\u201d ballad or hymnal style. Meanwhile, Hillsong Young & Free is more for the younger crowd and focuses on more electronic based music. They do more House, Tropical House, Electropop, and Trance music styles that tend to resonate more with younger people. I think Hillsong Y&F preform worship services during the youth group events and Hillsong Worship preforms worship services for general worship service. So the difference is style and demographic. They are one band, on one accord, just split up to have move variety in sound and reach more ears. Personally, I prefer Young & Free the most, just because I like their electronic sound better, but that\u2019s just because I like electronic music in general. ",
