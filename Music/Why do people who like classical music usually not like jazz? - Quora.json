            "answer_text": "'Classical' music tends to refer to a relatively small handful of composers who were simply lucky enough to become widely known because of the social circles that chose to favor them at key times. There were plenty who fit into the genre who didn't become more widely known simply because of influential people of their time. Some who are still considered to have been quite good actually had less involvement in the creation of some of their stuff than a handful of the musicians around them who played the music. Many of the most widely known compositions began with very simple melodies that the people *playing* them would either play wrong or intentionally adapt and those changes would sometimes quickly become incorporated in a rewrite. The people who tend to favor the more popular classical music often do so because it has been somewhat standardized over time and often has been played for far longer than the 'fan' has even been alive. The social circles in which it is most prevalent tend to also maintain some aspects of their structure over time. Most of it is pure pretense. Jazz tends to come from writers/players who either have no music education, or they just favor certain aspects of the styles that became quite common by those who intentionally choose to imitate key aspects of the writers. Early jazz had little to no actual structure in the beginning, but key elements were frequently adopted by some after hearing it from others. It's sort of like if all rap had been stuck with just a small collection of beats and melody snippets but never created nor adopted any new ones. From a certain point of view, modern rap is essentially identical to early jazz. Once again, a lot of the most popular jazz is either very early stuff that's still played with only minor alterations or is purely imitative from a set of key early popularized stuff that was simply recombined. The majority of modern jazz tends to be simply imitative or recombinant. Early stuff often had substantial differences between circles of players/creators, but a lot of that has disappeared in favor of attempting to stick to a bit of a known structure that didn't even exist in the early days. In relation to your question, the reverse is often also quite true, though that tends to be a bit less common because of the pretentious respect that even horrid 'classical' music tends to demand simply because of the genre and fame associated with more widely known compositions. Eliminating the vast herds who simply enjoy either classification for no reason other than familiarity and acceptance within specific social circles\u2026 the mathematical/musical structure of certain classical composers and sometimes just a handful of their compositions tends to have a clarity to it whose 'order' can be recognized to some degree or at least have a similar effect on widely different people who may have never even heard it before. The range of those common effects is quite wide for the (pseudo)genre, but the similarity of the effect has been shown to occur on a level that transcends typical human constructs like social structures, the effects are somewhat biological in point of origin and have a somewhat direct effect on psychology. What i mean is something beyond a typical set of things that are based on personal preferences, the more basic elements of what i'm talking about often have observably similar effects on baby humans and even a variety of animals. The very nature of jazz *as it's being played/composed on the spot*, as opposed to something that's being strictly imitated and played almost exactly the same way each time, tends to make use of those same principles on the spot. It's somewhat common for jazz musicians who are just playing together in a freestyle manner to pick up on a shift of 'mood' from just one person, and the others quickly follow suit, then that same one or sometimes another can change that mood and everyone follows suit again. In that way, it's a lot like a live conversation. Classical music tends to be more like reading a book in that different people and/or different days might have a somewhat different take on the same story, like identifying with one character one day and another on another day, but the general situation and events remain the same. Jazz tends to have many of the same basic elements as common aspects of life in general, but the story varies a lot from person to person and day to day. Classical music is like reading a book, everyone learns the same basic story, different parts can stand out to different people in different ways and at different times. Jazz can be more like asking a group of people all at once to tell you what happened last night. Each person will have a somewhat different point of view, sometimes they'll back each other right up in total agreement, other times someone will point out different parts that someone might have left out or maybe misunderstood. Go to that same group of people a year later and ask them to tell you about it again and you'll probably get quite a few of the same key parts, but it can still be essentially a very different story. With the textbook version, the variations are more about the reader's own mood or points of focus, but all the same details are still there each time. I hate most jazz because it's like going to the same bar with the same basic group of people, with a few new ones on some nights and others who are sometimes absent, but it's usually the same basic garbage for conversations about the same specific day. That day can be quite different for each person, and the one speaking the loudest on any given night is whichever person happens to be the most drunk at the time. They all still work at the same factory or whatever and have the same basic little collection of common stories, a variety of points of view on them, but it's still the same people and same stories. The problem is a single person can tell their own view of one story in such different ways, according to their own intoxication on different nights. The only common threads are that it's the same bunch of drunk idiots telling the same thing in a hundred different ways, and they're nearly always screwing it up. It's mildly entertaining once in a while, and it's pretty easy to pick whichever woman i want to go home with that night, but i could pick exactly the same woman each night for a month and it would be like 10 different women. By the end of the month, i realize it's not like she's someone new each time, it's more like she's just that one little group who happens to be inconsistent but is still a mix of the same icky mess that she has been for 20 years, and she has been telling everyone that she's 21 years old the whole time, except she's 41 now. Jazz is sort of like someone trying to tell me the story of 'lord of the rings' via sms texting in little 160 character bits, but they've only seen the movies, never read the books, and she's always drunk or high or sleep deprived or all of those when she's telling me. Classical music is like being with a woman who didn't write the books that the movies were based on, she's more like a person who was actually there, lived through the whole thing, and can consistently tell me the same basic story, whichever part of it we want to talk about on that particular night, and things like her tone of voice or emphasis on different details might vary, but it's US who chose which part of the story was going to be told that night. It's a long book and loaded with details that appear in the beginning and are still relevant at the end. People generally don't read the whole thing in a night or even over the course of a three day weekend. The movies can all be watched in half a day, get quite a bit wrong, and leave out TONS of very important parts. But sometimes there's nothing wrong with getting drunk and watching the movies, maybe i'll walk out during the first one with a woman who actually read the books and prefers those. Maybe she's only galadriel on that particular night, but at least she's still an elf the next morning, not some bearded dwarf chick in a dress. ",

            "answer_text": "The divide between classical and jazz aficionados is less pronounced today than it was 50 - 60 years ago, when music lovers* used to talk about jazz in contrast to \u2018serious\u201d music. As someone who has pursued both disciplines over that period, the implication that jazz is somehow not \u201cserious\u201d still galls me, not least because of its racist overtones. Well into my lifetime Porgy and Bess - not a jazz work although it uses, in an inspired fashion, the rhythms, harmonies and sonorities of jazz - was dismissed as \u2018not quite an opera\u201d - because its performers and subject-matter were African - Americans and its composer Jewish! It may be that the relative tolerance between the two groups may stem from the fact that, like Catholics and Protestants, they recognise each other as minorities in a world where the masses are either indifferent to both forms, or openly hostile to them. Jazz in just over a century has undergone a transformation that took five or six centuries in the Western art-music and, except in the case of - mostly amateur - groups who aim to preserve the integrity of early jazz against all innovations, the only way to learn jazz to a professional level is in college. Parallel to the antagonism between \u201chipsters\u201d and \u201csquares\u201d re jazz and classical music was an equally bitter one, now held only by very senior citizens, between the \u201ctraddies \u2018 or \u201cmouldy fygges\u201d for whom \u2018real\u201d jazz died with Bix Biederbecke, and the beboppers or modernists. This conflict also has become redundant in the face of pop, rock and other forms that the antagonists would hardly regard as music at all. Many classically trained musicians enjoy and respect jazz without understanding the process by which it is created, and only rarely make the crossover themselves. While it is well known that improvisation is not unique to jazz - that Bach, Beethoven and Paganini could improvise - but the uniqueness of jazz is in collective improvisation, in which each member of the group has a well-defined path - the bass player and drummer take control of the harmonic and rhythmic roots - but still has a certain flexibility on that path. \u201cGood\u201d jazz is like a discussion - each member knows their subject matter, listens respectfully to the others, makes their point succinctly, and all lead to a consensus. \u201cBad\u201d jazz is more like an argument - everyone wants to make their voice heard at the expense of the others, show what they can do, and`, and emerge as the winner. Even this can be valid and generate excitement, but only for limited periods. Not all jazz is improvised of course; there is almost always a theme , either a \u201cstandard\u201d known to all members of the band, or a jazz composition. The larger the group, the more written or pre-arranged material is necessary. ",
