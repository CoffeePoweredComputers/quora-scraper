            "answer_text": "There\u2019s is two main ways to donate: the paid version and the cost-free one. Most streamers will have a distinguished button on their channel with the word DONATE. Said button will direct you to one of the following platforms, depending of each streamer: Streamlabs OBS, Streamelements and Muxy are the most commom. They all accept the major credit cards flags and Paypal. So you just decide the amount and pay for it. Twitch Bits/Cheering is Twitch\u2019s own in-site currency that you can purchased on Amazon. You can then \u201ccheer\u201d in the live chat to get some attention from the streamer. If you do not have the extra money but still would like to support your favorite streamer you can use the cost-free donations tools, if available at his/her channel. Rechaaarge is one of them. By trying out an free app or game you would be donating to your streamer a X amount of money, depending of the app you tried. Ask your favorite streamer to use this tool so you and many others can help too! ",

            "answer_text": "It is quite easy to donate on Twitch. Visit the streamer\u2019s dashboard whom you want to donate. You will find a donation link there. I have characterized donation in four types: CheeringDirect/Paid DonationsCost-Free DonationsCharityHere, I will only cover the types of donations. For the whole procedures and the payment options, you can read this complete guide on how to donate money on Twitch. One of the most common ways of donating on Twitch is cheering, which means a donation of bits. You can buy bits from the Twitch official website. Moreover, Cheering on Twitch also earns you a badge.  Direct/Paid Donations means donating through PayPal or services like Streamlabs or StreamElements.  Moreover, there is one more amazing option to donate on Twitch, even without spending money. In this, you just need to try some games or apps and automatically the streamers will get the money. You may find links to such sites on creators dashboards. Even many streamers link to charity sites which raise fund for some noble cause. These were some of the common types of donations on Twitch. I hope this helps. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "From my experiences most if not all transactions on twitch are done through Paypal. Which is safe and reliable, but most donations are done as a gift and therefore are nonrefundable. I have seen streamers in the past refund parents if there kids got a hold of their card and made a large donation. I have also seen some streamers who have a Patreon account linked in their bio. This is another safe way to donate to you favorite streamer. Allen Chi ",
