            "answer_text": "For a MASSIVE amount of reasons. Here\u2019s my personal top 10: The artist has sold his music using different channels which were not included in the contract he signed with the record labelThe artist has deliberately talked shit of the record label publiclyThe artist has posted a picture of the contract on a social platform (like Facebook, Instagram, etc) he signed with the record label without permission obtained by the label OR without removing/hiding sensitive data such as name, surname, physical address, bank account details, etc etc.The artist has deliberately shared his track for free via unauthorised channels, which is going against the biggest principle of a record label. (a.k.a. you must be an idiot if you really do so).The artist was caught breaching the contract terms in any direct or indirect way: if you\u2019re making a living out of your music, then you should be really careful in reading the contracts before signing them. If you sign them, then there is no point in complaining or moaning because of the very low royalties rates you\u2019re earning yearly. YOU, the artist, are obliged to read the contract fully, not the Label owners.Signing a contract with a record label might also involve a long-term relationship with said label. Example: you sign to exclusively release your music via this label for the next 5 years. SO\u2026if you\u2019re caught releasing your music on another label (without the main label permission) then you\u2019re out!It goes without saying: you can promote your music, you can also promote your label if you want. But never and i repeat NEVER do things that will involve in a negative way your label. The label is NOT responsible of your actions and can decide to drop you. Example: With your contract it is also included a special fee you will share with the label, if the label gets requests to re-licence your track on different formats, such as a CD compilation or a Vinyl exclusive release. Now, if you\u2019re clever you will just stick to the rules signed with the contract. If you don\u2019t like the fact that you will only earn 20% of the royalties made by selling your music via CD, you do NOT try to sell your (signed ak.a. copyrighted) music via other platforms which have not been used by the label. You are the artist, not the distributor. Everyone has a specific role.Did I mention those artists who release music with a label without informing the label that the track is NOT an actual exclusive submissions? Bang, you\u2019re out as soon as the label will find it out. Oh, you can also incur in a consistent fine if you\u2019ve deliberately misled the label with your actions (small label can\u2019t be bothered, they will just kick you out. Big majors instead\u2026well\u2026 $$$$$$).As obvious as it sounds but a label can simply drop you just because your contract with them is over and they no longer need you/wish to work with you. As simple as that.Last but no least: your music was good and now isn\u2019t anymore. Hey, we all have to stick to our music philosophy, both artist and label wise. If we think your music is not brilliant and cool as it used to be, then we can take the decision to not accept your new demo, even if we\u2019ve signed 45 demos of your in the last 3 months.Here\u2019s the FAB TOP 10!

            "answer_text": "There are a variety of reasons why a singer could get dropped. 1). The trends have changed. Record labels move much faster these days, but sometimes the trends will change between the time the singer gets signed to the release of their album. A great example of this is during the Lilith Fair era. Labels were signing female singer/songwriters at record speed. By the time their albums came out, teen pop took over the radio airwaves. Many albums were shelved, some came out and were promoted for a few weeks. Several artists who had platinum success on their previous release suddenly had no exposure on radio. These artists were dropped. 2). Sales are lackluster. The artist is not making an impact at radio or the various media outlets that the record is pushed to. 3). The record label has merged with another label. When record labels merge with each other, artists usually get caught in the crossfire. 4). A key executive has left the label. On any given label, some artists will be \u201cpriority\u201d, some will be on the back burner. Some will be shelved or dropped. Often the key to success is that one executive who is fighting for that artist. An artist can opt for a \u201ckey man clause\u201d so they can elect to leave the label if that happens. 5) Politics. As Anthony Sobers-Assue mentioned the behavior and lack of work ethic can bring a label to drop an artist. Sometimes an artist will choose to wildly switch creative directions after a label signs them. Sometimes it can be the behavior of the management company or someone in the artists team that is causing issue. 6) The artist is not willing to \u201cplay the game\u201d. Depending on the artist and genre, sometimes the label will want to mold an image that does not sit well with the artist. ",
