            "answer_text": "To sum up the other three answers, in music, everything matters. If the band is off-time, they sound like crap. If the intonation is off, even just a little jangly, it sounds bad. If the sound system has a bit too much upper mids, then everything sounds nasal and honky. If they didn't set up a sound system with enough headroom, then it sounds bad because of overdrive. The singers have to be listening to the monitors and singing with the right blend, which means the monitor mixer has to be on the ball. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no single factor. I think the biggest contributor is the sound board operator, if there is one. I\u2019ve played with superb technicians who had great ears, and also with wankers who thought the guitar should always be the loudest volume in the band. After that it\u2019s the sound system components, including all of the microphones, amps, pa system, and even cables. Low quality gear will not yield high quality sound. One major factor is whether the musicians can hear themselves, so good monitor is major. Third factor is the skill of the musicians\u2014are they expereienced and capable of live performance, or do they freeze up a little onstage? ",
