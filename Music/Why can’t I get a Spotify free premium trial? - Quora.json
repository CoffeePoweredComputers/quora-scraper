            "answer_text": "Guys, there is an easy way, just GO HERE! Open Spotify. Go to in your web browser. This will open the Spotify Premium page. 2. Click START FREE TRIAL. It's a green button in the middle of the Spotify page. 3. Enter your account information if prompted. If you weren't logged into the Spotify website, you'll be prompted to enter your email address and password and then click LOG IN before continuing. If you were logged in, skip to the next step.If you don't have an account, you can click Sign Up at the bottom of the page and fill out the form to create a new Spotify account. You'll need to go back to the Spotify Premium page after doing this.4. Enter payment information. While you won't be charged the $9.99 monthly fee for the first month, you'll still need to enter your card name, number, expiration date, and security code on the payment page. Spotify Premium no longer accepts PayPal as a payment method, so you'll need a credit or debit card for this step. 5. Click START 30-DAY FREE TRIAL NOW. It's a green button below the payment information section. This will start your Premium subscription immediately; you'll have access to Spotify Premium features for free for 30 days, after which point you'll be charged $9.99 per month until you cancel the subscription.If you cancel the subscription a day or more before it's set to renew, you won't be billed for the next month. After the trial runs out, you will retain all offline music, but don\u2019t have access to stream. So you can try NoteBurner Spotify Music Converter to keep your music playable even if the free trial ends.  ",
