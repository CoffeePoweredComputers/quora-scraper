            "answer_text": "C2-E6? Are you for real?  Go record a YT vid of your range already and shock the world! Just kidding you don't have to.   In classical singing, there are many classifications but the basic ones for women are: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto (extremely rare). Inside of those three categories are more categories, but I think you just want to know which basic category your voice fits in to. Voice parts depend on where the strength of your voice lies. In other words, which part of your range is the strongest.   For example, if your low notes are softer and quieter and your middle-high (middle of the treble clef and up) is stronger and more powerful than you would be classified as a soprano.  If, however, you have a powerful low range that is quite loud (without being forced/strained) and is naturally powerful and perhaps have a less consistent high range (not as comfortable), than you would be classified as a mezzo-soprano or contralto depending on exactly where your voice is the strongest. You really need to be heard by someone before they can classify your voice any further. Range is not usually the indicator of voice classification except in middle school or high school. ",

            "answer_text": "C2 is very low, and is the first formal tone of the bass vocal range. It's incredible for you to be able to hit a tone that deep, cleanly. I'm a man with a rather low voice and the furthest down I can get is around G2, I can do it clean, but it strains my vocal chords, so I obviously don't do it. For the upper part, E6, is a tad high as well, highest note of the soprano.If you can sing all notes clean, I would go with the range that suis your voice the best. Check if you are comfortable with the range, any strain or pain is unwanted. Try and record your tones and give it a listen, what sounds the best? You will most deffinetely not want to box yourself, if you have such an incredible voice, use it. But if you want to know which voice you have, do what I just told you. Good day. :) ",
