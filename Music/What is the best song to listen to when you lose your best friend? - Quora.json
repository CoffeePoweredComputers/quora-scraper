            "answer_text": "I would suggest not to listen to any song at this stage . It will just make you nostalgic of the good times and you will eventually face chronic depression . The advice that I would like to give you go for jogging or running in the park . Interact with nature , watch the young kids playing , and you will feel good. Look , going through a fading friendship is one of the most difficult task ever I life more than those \u201clove affairs\u201d. . But still you want to listen to songs then go for khaabon ke parindey. Movie : Zindagi Na milengi dobara . It is a soothing one . I listen to this one actually had been listening since 7months (u know a fading friendship)\u2026or photograph by ed Sheeran ",
