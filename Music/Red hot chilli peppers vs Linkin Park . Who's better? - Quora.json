            "answer_text": "I believe there is no comparision between the two. Both bands are great in some respects, though they play very different styles, so you have to compare them with common variables. If you were to compare their stage presence, the Red Hot Chili Peppers win hands down for their notoriety of rocking the stage naked with socks over their privates. When you listen to the interplay between guitar and bass parts, it is clear that Red Hot Chili Peppers have a much more developed and complex sound. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been around much longer than Linkin Park, and they are still widely popular. Therefore, I will have to say that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the better band. RHCP varies the types of songs they write. Linkin Park writes all the same types of songs. Besides, compare Flea to Linkin Park's bassist. I don't even know his name. Plus a member of Linkin Park (not Chester or the two Asian guys) fired a member of stage crew for not giving him one of his burritos. :P Red Hot Chili Peppers are way better than Linkin Park, I know it, You know it, the President of Peru knows it, even Linkin Park knows it, for god's sake!!!! Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "Wow this is sad !!! Firstly can you compare apples and oranges ?? There is no such thing is competitive art. Period. If you ask me personally who is better of the two I would say RHCP without doubt..Why?? because take a look at the band members Anthony, Chad smith, Flea, John Frusciante (Ex member) and Josh. Chad, Flea and JF are a supergroup all by themselves. Dont believe me listen to this  this was imrov they dont this type of epic stuff on their records because they are lyrics driven. I dont mean to say LP sucks or anyting but i liked them more when they were rapcore ",
