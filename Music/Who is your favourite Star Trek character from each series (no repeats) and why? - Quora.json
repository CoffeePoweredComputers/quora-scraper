            "answer_text": "My favorite Star Trek Characters by series are (and this list is going in Chronological Order in-Universe for Star Trek Series, so this isn\u2019t by when they were aired): Star Trek Enterprise: (My Number One Favorite Series): Captain Jonathan Archer, Sub-Commander/Commander T\u2019Pol, and Ensign Hoshi Sato (also the 3 characters I use the most in my Star Trek Enterprise FanFiction). Jonathan was the one who brought the Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites together and in doing so formed the predecessor to The United Federation of Planets; The Coalition of Planets. Commander T\u2019Pol was always in Season 1 and Season 2 appearing to be heading for being in a relationship with Captain Archer and the writers destroyed this, but brought it back in the episode \u201cTwilight\u201d in Season 3 and with the hug in \u201cThese Are The Voyages\u2026\u201d. There was even a first draft for the series that centered on this between Jonathan and T\u2019Pol. And I like Hoshi Sato because she started out not having her footing for space travel but by the end of the series, the fully 10 years in space she had become a vital member of the crew. My Most Hated Star Trek Enterprise Character: Commander Charles \u201cTrip\u201d Tucker III and I am 100% glad he died in the Series Finale for Star Trek Enterprise \u201cThese Are The Voyages\u2026\u201d set in 2161. He deserved to die and the most important thing about his death is he died Heroic for he died saving the most important person wanting to be seen during the signing of the Federation Charter: Captain Jonathan Archer. Star Trek Discovery (DIS or DSC): I haven\u2019t chosen any character here yet since this series technically just started and its Second Season hasn\u2019t even begone yet. Michael Burnham is good but she is also the character the show is primarily following so that is the one people are supposed to relate to with the series. Star Trek The Original Series (TOS): I would have to say Captain James T. Kirk and Spock but I really don\u2019t have a reason for liking them for really I am not a full fan of TOS and found it to be boring, even though I only started watching it with reruns for I found TOS boring with most of the episodes. I would have to say that I preferred the TOS TMP movies. Star Trek The Next Generation (TNG): I have to say I like Captain Jean-Luc Picard. He was what I would call a stern Captain and stuck to his guns. Picard also was the one willing to stand up to Starfleet and the Federation when they were \u201cbreaking the Prime Directive\u201d or forcing the Forced Locations of species; Star Trek Insurrection. Star Trek Deep Space Nine (DS9): Captain Benjamin Sisko and Ensign Ezri Tigan Dax. Captain Sisko was both a smart commanding officer and also was the one helping to come up with the strategy to defeat the Dominion. Operation Return (to retake Deep Space Nine) was all his plan and even the brass heads at Starfleet Command weren\u2019t originally 100% on taking the plan yet Sisko sold them on it. Ezri herself was just a mere counselor before she came to DS9 yet after she was on the Command Track and became Captain of her own Starship; the USS Aventine. Star Trek Voyager (VOY): Seven of Nine I would have to say my favorite and it has nothing to do with her \u201ccatsuit\u201d and them wanting an attractive actress. I like her over the others because she had to regain her humanity and that just isn\u2019t easy but she made it look easy at times. By the end of the series, the books and her appearance in Star Trek Online she appears to have succeeded at that. ",

            "answer_text": "From the original series: Spock. No actor could have played that iconic character and still be enjoyed by fans after half a century, like Leonard Nimoy. It pleases me that he is the only actor to have appeared in all episodes - including the two pilot ones. I rate him as the best actor on \u201cStar Trek: The Original Series.\u201d William Shatner as Kirk comes a close second. The only characters I really like from \u201cThe Next Generation,\u201d are those of Data and Q. His quirky personality of Data, I find very entertaining and Brett Spiner was well cast in the role. John De Lancie is outstanding as Q! He made the character his own. In \u201cDeep Space Nine,\u201d it's a tie between Odo and Quark. In their separate scenes, both characters are always interesting. Together, they take centre stage from all the other regular cast members. The actors gave their respective characters a lot of depth and that they evolved over the course of the show. Eventually, Odo and Quark came to respect each other - albeit begrudgingly. \u201cVoyager\u201d has several bland characters, in all honesty. However, Seven of Nine and the holographic doctor are the characters to watch in my opinion. The former did much to revitalize the flagging fortunes of \u201cVoyager\u201d and not just for something as shallow as mere sex appeal. I thought the character blended into the proceedings very naturally. The latter was interesting, in that he developed a personality and feelings, despite being a hologram. He revealed a more tragic side to his nature, underneath his rather cynical and aloof exterior. I'm thinking of the episode where he creates his own private world - that of a family home and having a wife and children. It was something he desired but knew he could never have. As for the other \u201cTrekkie\u201d shows, I've not seen enough episodes to form an opinion but I'll get round to it. ",
