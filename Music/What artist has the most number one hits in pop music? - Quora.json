            "answer_text": "That would be the magnificent Richard Clayderman. He may not have sold the most albums or singles, but that\u2019s only because he chooses not to. In fact, he\u2019s been known to actively deny people the right to buy his music. I\u2019m not sure why he does this, but it could perhaps be that his French modesty prevents him from allowing too much Richard Clayderman music to be unleashed on the world? Maybe his music is just TOO good to be available to everyone? So how can he have the most number one hits in pop music history? Well, one doesn\u2019t need to buy Richard Clayderman to know Richard Clayderman. His glorious piano renditions of famous pieces by better and more talented composers than he is, is surely something we all carry around with us in our hearts? He\u2019s known as \u201cthe most successful pianist in the world\u201d and yet, you never see his name on the charts, do you? Well, there\u2019s your proof. Dickie, as his most fervent fans like to call him, is simply the best of them all. So good that all of his albums sound exactly the same. THAT\u2019S the kind of consistent quality we\u2019re dealing with here! Dickie never changes because he doesn\u2019t need to. He\u2019s above perfection. He even has the same haircut he had in the 80\u2019s! Clothes, too! What a guy! ",

            "answer_text": "Taken from an article found in Trivia Genius: The Beatles have 20 Number-one hits according to the Billboard Top 100 charts. Regarded as most influential band of all time, the forerunners of the British Invasion are the best-selling band in history to date. Throughout their career, the Beatles sold 1.6 BILLION (you know, billion, with a B) singles and 177 million albums. Of their singles, 20 took the Number-one spot on the pop charts for a running total of 59 weeks at the top of Billboard. From their status as icons of the counter-culture movement of the '60s and '70s to the earth-shattering feuds surrounding the breakup of their band, the legacy of The Beatles is one of pop history and folklore. It comes as no surprise that they earned their timeless spot at the top of industry records. ",
