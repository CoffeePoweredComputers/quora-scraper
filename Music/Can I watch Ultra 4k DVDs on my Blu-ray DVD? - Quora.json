            "answer_text": "4k DVDs do not exist, unless they are written as DATA format, not Video format. 4k Blu Ray discs do exist, but you can\u2019t play them back from a regular DVD player. Blu ray players are 1080p, so I would presume they\u2019re not able to play 4k Content from the disc. Some more modern might be, especially if the they can play back 4k streaming. However, they would also need to be able to read DVD-R or BD-R discs, and play back the format the movie is written in, as the only way to get 4k content on a Blu Ray disc, is if the compression format is better than the MPEG 2 format used on standard Blu Rays. Like, if the 4k content is compressed in h.264 or h.265 (if your player supports it); you could fit 1 or 2 4k movies on a DVD ROM easily. But in their native MPEG 2 compression, you\u2019d be lucky to fit 45\u201360 minutes of 4k movie on 4,7GB. ",

            "answer_text": "Just as a point of information, neither format has \u201cDVD\u201d anywhere in the name. DVD refers specifically to the standard definition disc format that debuted in the 1990s. The abbreviation for Blu-ray Disc is \u201cBD.\u201d To answer your question, 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is a new format that uses the same type of disc as a normal Blu-ray (albeit with more storage space) but is incompatible with standard Blu-ray players because of the different types of encoding used. To play 4K Ultra HD discs you\u2019ll need a new 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player. Be careful when researching your purchase to make sure it actually plays the new disc format - many standard Blu-ray players are now marketed with the terms \u201c4K\u201d and/or \u201cUltra HD\u201d in the advertising but only \u201cupscale\u201d standard Blu-ray Discs to 4K resolution, which doesn\u2019t actually add any detail or image quality enhancements. The Xbox One S and Xbox One X game consoles also play 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, but note that the standard Xbox One does not, and none of the Xbox models support Dolby Vision HDR content. ",

If that\u2019s the case, no, you cannot watch it on Blu-ray player devices. 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is not comparable with Blu-ray player on the market. It\u2019s kind of made for 4K TV, at least for now. But there is a way to watch 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray without upgrading your player though, and that is play it on PC and watch it with Leawo Blu-ray Player. If your PC doesn\u2019t have an internal Blu-ray drive, buy an external Blu-ray drive and it will be the same. Top 3 best external Blu-ray drives for Mac ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: NO. They\u2019re two different formats. You can play a BD (Blu-ray disc) on a 4K Ultra Blu-ray player, but not the converse. The newer format players are backwards compatible with the earlier formats, ie. BD, DVD and audio CDs. Just as a BD player will be compatible with DVDs and CDs. ",
