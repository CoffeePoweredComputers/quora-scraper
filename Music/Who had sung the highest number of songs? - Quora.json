            "answer_text": "I am not sure how to interpret your question. If you want to know who wrote/created the most songs in the world and if you limit the ambit of this question to pop music (i.e.: the genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s and that includes pop, folk and rock songs that made it into the charts), then I think Bob Dylan would be a strong candidate. He has has released 36 studio albums, 91 singles, 26 notable extended plays, 40 music videos, 12 live albums, 13 volumes comprising The Bootleg Series, 19 compilation albums, 13 box sets and 7 soundtracks as main contributor. This one's my personal favorite Dylan song:  cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_discographyCf. https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/11/bob-dylan-songs-ranked-no-1-every-song-mississippi-like-a-rolling-stone-visions-of-johanna-rainy-day-woman Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday, so we thought we\u2019d look back at this ranking of all 359 of his songs. Bob Dylan releases the 12th volume of his much-heralded Bootleg Series on Friday. This one \u2014 alternate takes, rehearsals and false starts from his mid-60s heyday \u2014 is one of the best collections of Columbia\u2019s tremendous archival material from America\u2019s greatest artist. To honor the release, FTW ranked the 350-plus songs Dylan has put out in his career. The criteria was simple: We ranked studio releases only (including movie soundtracks) or songs that Dylan played in concert more than 100 times. Ironically, we couldn\u2019t rank the bootlegs (official or not, though we wanted to) or else this list would be well into the thousands. Each of the top 25 songs is accompanied by comment, the rest of the top 100 has some intermittently sprinkled throughout and then the next 259 songs have Youtube clips of some of the deeper tracks (or in the case of the bottom 100, the ones I loathe the least). 1. Mississippi ( \u201dLove & Theft\u201d, 2001) Four years after his career was revived with Time Out of Mind, Dylan released a single in the summer of 2001 (Po\u2019 Boy) and announced that his new album, \u201cLove & Theft\u201d would be released on Sept. 11. Though the album was recorded far before that horrific day, the connections are chilling, especially on the album standout, Mississippi. It includes lines about being trapped in a city that has a \u201csky full of fire\u201d and \u201cpain pourin\u2019 down,\u201d not to mention the endlessness of emptiness. But all of Dylan\u2019s work has been as evocative as this, even from when he was a 21-year-old folk singer trying to make it in the Village. The greatest Dylan songs are about that inexorable march toward the end. But never is he so wistful about the wasted years, lost love and loneliness as he is on Mississippi. When he sings about that great mistake of his life \u2014 staying in Mississippi a day too long \u2014 you can practically see a wry smile on his face, as if that memory of the perfect woman at the perfect time is better than chasing that dream. 2. Visions Of Johanna ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) If ever Dylan captured that thin, wild, mercury sound he craved, it was on his 1966 masterpiece, Blonde on Blonde. But Visions broke that mold of the first side of the first record \u2014 a haunting, acoustic journey about a mysterious woman who may or may not exist. Few, if any, of Dylan\u2019s songs are about drugs, but rarely are they more prevalent than on a handful of BoB songs. I mean, one doesn\u2019t write: \u201cBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues you can tell by the way she smiles/See the primitive wallflower freeze/When the jelly-faced women all sneeze/Hear the one with the mustache say, \u2018Jeez, I can\u2019t find my knees.\u2019/Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule/But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\u201d without a little speed kick. Shoot, that makes Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds sound like kiddie lit. Some would argue this is Dylan\u2019s greatest song. For me, the top two alternate every few months or so. They\u2019re both pure brilliance, among the top 10 rock song in history, as is the next song on our list. 3. Like A Rolling Stone ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) Bruce Springsteen said at Dylan\u2019s Rock N\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame induction that the first time he heard the song \u201cthat snare shot sounded like somebody had kicked open the door to your mind.\u201d Having been a Dylan fan for 25 years, I think of that quote often: What was it like for a teenager, adult or anyone to open up the Highway 61 vinyl, put it on the turntable and drop the needle to hear that opening note and then the full, luscious sound that followed? Rolling Stone had this as No. 1 on their list of 500 best songs ever and who can argue? The Beatles had released (the underrated) Help! just a few days before Highway 61 and while that album is wonderful in its own right, it was barely in the same universe as Highway. Even Rubber Soul and Revolver couldn\u2019t catch up. The Beatles would have to wait until Sgt. Pepper\u2019s, two years later (and after Blonde on Blonde), before their grand creation. LARS is the Dylan song that initiates most in to the Dylan fraternity. It\u2019s his biggest hit. And it has every damn right to be. 4. Abandoned Love ( Desire outtake, 1975) Bounced from Desire for the forgettable Joey (a song about the mobster Joey Gallo who had been gunned down years earlier), Abandoned Love would have turned Desire from a respectable follow-up to Blood On The Tracks to another mid-70s masterpiece. The Scarlet Rivera violin licks here are as good as anything that made the album. 5. Not Dark Yet ( Time Out of Mind, 1997) Dylan hadn\u2019t yet had his brush with death when he wrote Not Dark Yet, which makes the \u201cit\u2019s not dark yet/but it\u2019s getting there\u201d chorus all the more haunting. For all the bleakness on this record, it\u2019s amazing that four years later he\u2019d make one of his happier albums, Love & Theft. 6. The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019 ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) If Like A Rolling Stone is taught on the first day of Dylan 101, The Times\u2026 are on the syllabus for day two. Though appropriated for countless songs that came after and almost given too much importance in the Civil Rights movement, it\u2019s still Dylan\u2019s classic song from the first-period of his career. 7. Shelter From The Storm ( Blood on the Tracks, 1975) \u201cBeauty walks a razor\u2019s edge, someday I\u2019ll make it mine,\u201d Dylan sings in Shelter. Nearly 40 years later, he wrote \u201call I know is that I\u2019m thrilled by your kiss.\u201d Mission accomplished? 8. Desolation Row ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) Though the fills of session guitarist Charlie McCoy are tremendous, providing nuance to the easy three-chord progression played by Dylan, this 11-minute album closer is highlighted by Dylan\u2019s characters \u2014 Cinderella, Bette Davis, Romeo, Cain, Abel, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Opheila, Noah, Einstein (disguised as Robin Hood), Dr. Filth, The Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Nero, the Titanic, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. 9. Just Like A Woman ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) Nobody really speculates about the subject of Dylan\u2019s greatest love ballad (though Edie Sedgwick has been thrown around), which is odd given the decades of attention people have paid to who Carly Simon was singing about in You\u2019re So Vain. 10. Tangled Up In Blue ( Blood on the Tracks, 1975) Some part of Dylan died the day he record his immortal Tangled in a studio in Minnesota. Was it the\u201960s? His views of the \u201960s? His marriage? Thousands upon thousands of words have been spilled on the subject and Dylan\u2019s structure, characterizations and Shakespearean verse. It\u2019s the song he said took 10 years to live and two years to write. But this is for certain: Never before has viciousness sounded so vivacious. 11. Girl From The North Country ( Nashville Skyline, 1969) Keith Richards likes the original better. There\u2019s no arguing with Keith Richards, so we\u2019ll just put the Johnny Cash duet higher and hope Keith doesn\u2019t notice. 12. I Want You ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) Too often on lists such as this, there\u2019s a tendency to want to spread the wealth and let multiple albums have a track in the top 20. That\u2019s nonsense. Blonde on Blonde is Dylan\u2019s greatest album. Of course it\u2019s going to have four of the top 14 spots on the rankings. 13. Lily, Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts ( Blood on the Tracks, 1975) (The same goes for Blood on the Tracks.) The original New York version sounded like a slower, more coherent Desolation Row. The frenetic take from Minneapolis, the one which made it to the album, turns this chorus-less track into Dylan\u2019s greatest storytelling song: 14. Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) Dylan\u2019s narrators, whether fictional (as in this song and dozens of others) or real (like in his tremendous memoirs Chronicles or in his various protest songs about specific events), are always unreliable, especially in this classic with the \u201cFrench girl\u201d who \u201cknows me well\u201d or the railroad man who \u201csmoked my eyelids and punched my cigarettes.\u201d 15. Love Sick ( Time Out of Mind, 1997) In terms of importance, this would be in the top five, as it was the track that kicked off Dylan\u2019s late-career renaissance (and also got him onto a Victoria\u2019s Secret commercial.) It also made for one of the strangest moment in Grammy\u2019s history, yes, even weider than that time Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard rushed Shawn Colvin\u2019s acceptance speech by saying Wu-Tang is for the children. 16. A Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) There are more origin stories about this one than a comic-book character. Dylan has said that every line in the song is the first line to another song he never got around to writing. He said it was a poem he never intended to perform. (Clinton Heylin, the Dylan biographer, provides solid evidence to the contrary.) The rhythm was taken from a 500-year-old ballad. And the \u201chard rain\u201d was never intended to be about nuclear fallout, but a bit of everything relating to the chaos of those frightening times. Oh, and Dylan was 21 when he wrote it. 17. Love Minus Zero/No Limit ( Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) Put it on for the first time and it sounds like something you\u2019ve heard a thousand times before, yet is wholly unique in its own right. When the Dylan classics got a remastered release a few years back, this was one of the tracks that jumped out: the embellishments by second guitarist Bruce Langhorne showed that so much more was going on than descending chords in a Dylan-esque dropped-C with a fourth-fret capo. (These alternate takes open the new Bootleg Series record and for good reason. They draw attention to the subtle nuances of how Dylan changed chords, lyrics, fills and pauses. It\u2019s gorgeous.) 18. I Threw It All Away ( Nashville Skyline, 1969) My buddy, with whom I\u2019ve had multiple listening Dylan parties, seen over a dozen shows with over the years and consulted with me on this list, implored me to put this lower. I complied because he\u2019s getting married on Saturday but at some point had to say, hey, make your own list, bub. Like everything on Nashville Skyline, this is a simple song with simple, plain lyrics sung in a smooth, country croon. It\u2019s one of Dylan\u2019s greatest laments. 19. Baby, Let Me Follow You Down ( Bob Dylan, 1962) It\u2019s perhaps the best song performed in the electric sets of Dylan\u2019s famous 1966 shows \u2014 played with sneering disregard to a crowd that tried clapping to get Dylan and The Hawks off their rhythm in the \u201cRoyal Albert Hall,\u201d show. All of it showed the versatility of Dylan: A song performed acoustically, with a harmonica of course, on Bob\u2019s debut was now an electric showcase performed with a full band \u2014 who would eventually become The Band \u2014 that was just beginning to find its sea legs. 20. My Back Pages ( Another Side of Bob Dylan, 1964) \u201cI was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now.\u201d 21. Absolutely Sweet Marie ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) It wasn\u2019t until Sweet Marie, the 11th track on a 14-song album, that Blonde on Blonde \u201centered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll,\u201d wrote the music historian Sean Wilentz. 22. Blowin\u2019 In The Wind ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) A great, early Dylan track, and one that helped make him famous, but loses points because the Peter, Paul and Mary version was, frankly, better. But this hit started the unyielding criticism that Dylan plagiarizes his music/lyrics, a claim he talked about with Rolling Stone last year: \u201cPeople have tried to stop me every inch of the way. They\u2019ve always had bad stuff to say about me. Newsweek magazine lit the fuse way back when. Newsweek printed that some kid from New Jersey wrote \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and it wasn\u2019t me at all. And when that didn\u2019t fly, people accused me of stealing the melody from a 16th-century Protestant hymn. And when that didn\u2019t work, they said they made a mistake and it was really an old Negro spiritual. So what\u2019s so different? It\u2019s gone on for so long I might not be able to live without it now. \u2019em. I\u2019ll see them all in their graves.\u201d 23. Restless Farewell ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) How could a 22-year-old write such a brilliant a song about a \u201cfalse clock\u201d trying to \u201ctick out my time?\u201d It sounds so aged, like something that could have appeared on one of Time Out of Mind. But the song, Dylan\u2019s 90th, isn\u2019t about death, it\u2019s about an infamous Newsweek article/hatchet-job that claimed Blowin\u2019 In The Wind was written by a New Jersey high-school student, hence the \u201cdirt of gossip\u201d and \u201cdust of rumor\u201d he sings of. 24. Nettie Moore ( Modern Times, 2006) The truest sign of a Dylan fan: Ask them to name their 10 favorite songs from 1997 on. If they can name three, you\u2019ve got yourself a Dylan fan. But since so much of a music fan\u2019s Dylan knowledge comes from just a 12-year period from 1963 to 1975, his late-career renaissance isn\u2019t as appreciated by even great music fans. So kick back, put on the headphones and enjoy one of his 10 best from modern times. 25. 4th Time Around ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) Known best for parodying The Beatles (and John Lennon\u2019s) Norwegian Wood, this late BoB track reportedly upset Lennon, who felt he was being made fun of. \u201cJohn treats Bob almost like a God,\u201d Alf Bicknell, the Beatles chauffeur at the time wrote in his diary. But George Harrison thought it was about Dylan hearing Norwegian Wood and, assuming that Lennon and McCartney had written it after listening to his stuff too much, now Bob was now keeping the back-and-forth going (hence the song\u2019s title). Dylan resisted The Beatles until he heard I Want To Hold Your Hand while driving in Colorado, right about the time you couldn\u2019t resist them any longer. Later, Dylan would apparently put an upside down picture of The Beatles on the cover of his decidedly un-60s John Wesley Harding. 26. Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache ( Good Rockin\u2019 Tonight: The Legacy of Sun Records, 2001) A rockabilly cover of an old Sun Record song that\u2019s as infectious as any of the tunes made famous by the legendary Memphis music house. 27. Every Grain Of Sand ( Shot of Love, 1981) Anytime someone says Dylan lost it in the \u201980s, play them this haunting, gorgeous plea for salvation. And then readily conceded that the mid-\u201980s were certainly lost. 28. Moonlight ( \u201dLove & Theft\u201d, 2001) Though this will be lost on all but the most hardcore Dylan fans, picking this song in the old, immortal \u201cDylan Pool\u201d won it for our team \u201cThe One With The Mustache.\u201d 29. Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) Nine years after writing this 16-minute capper to Blonde on Blonde, Dylan would confirm on the Desire album what most suspected already: the sad-eyed lady he sings of was his wife Sara. 30. Only a Pawn in Their Own Game ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) The best of Dylan\u2019s racial protest songs. It begins with a startle \u2014 \u201cA bullet from the back of the bush shot Medgar Evers\u2019 blood\u201d \u2014 and doesn\u2019t let up until we get to the murderer\u2019s epitaph at the end. 31. Positively 4th Street (single, 1965) 32. One More Night ( Nashville Skyline, 1969) 33. Oh, Sister ( Desire, 1976) Dylan saw the fiddler/violinist Scarlet Rivera walking down 2nd Ave. and brought her into the Desire sessions. Her strings leave an indelible mark on each track, most notably on Oh, Sister, which also include a haunting vocal by the session\u2019s background singer, Emmylou Harris. 34. Ballad of a Thin Man ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) A phenomenal track that\u2019s underproduced on Highway 61 but gets its full due in concert, especially as the lead-in to the \u201cJudas!\u201d cry in Manchester in 1966. Play loud. 35. The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) \u201cNow is the time for your tears\u201d was the great reveal in Dylan\u2019s protest masterpiece, one with lyrics that read like journalism \u2014 albeit, much like his other protest songs based off real events, journalism that plays hard and loose with the facts. 36. Subterranean Homesick Blues ( Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) 37. Blind Willie McTell (Infidels outtake, 1983) 38. Changing of the Guards ( Street Legal, 1978) One of Dylan\u2019s weirdest, most enigmatic songs lyrically (and that\u2019s saying something). But this is his lost gem of the \u201970s, overshadowed by the sneering Blood on the Tracks and the songs on Desire that became pop-culture icons. 39. It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) Dylan played this song second in his famous \u201celectric\u201d set at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, though it was called Phantom Engineer then. 40. Soon After Midnight ( Tempest, 2012) The best song off Dylan\u2019s last album of originals, this simple ditty is like Mississippi lite, with lines that resemble the lost love expressed in our No. 1 song. 41. Huck\u2019s Tune ( Lucky You soundtrack, 2005) Even some Dylan fans might not be aware of this deep cut from a horrible Eric Bana poker movie but it\u2019s surprisingly great, even after you catch the last five minutes of the movie on HBO2 (not good enough for regular HBO) and hear, wincingly, that the main character\u2019s name is \u201cHuck.\u201d 42. Tonight I\u2019ll Be Staying Here With You ( Nashville Skyline, 1969) A staple of his Rolling Thunder Revue shows, it\u2019s the most rocking track on the genre-busting Nashville. 44. One Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later) ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) 43. Things Have Changed ( Wonder Boys soundtrack, 2000) Dylan seemed genuinely surprised and touched when this song won the Oscar in 2001, delivering a heartfelt acceptance speech from Sydney, where he was on his Never Ending Tour. 45. Girl From The North Country ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) The superior, non-Johnny Cash, version Keith Richards spoke of. You decide: 46. Tell Me That It Isn\u2019t True ( Nashville Skyline, 1969) This is so much harder an exercise than I imagined. You could make your own list and have any of the previous 46 songs in the top 10 (and plenty after this) and no Dylan fan could really argue. 47. Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power) ( Street Legal, 1978) 48. One Too Many Mornings ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) Another folk song changed indelibly by the electric rendition on the 1966 tour. 49. Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door ( Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid soundtrack, 1973) 50. It Ain\u2019t Me, Babe ( Another Side of Bob Dylan, 1964) 51. Po\u2019 Boy ( \u201dLove & Theft\u201d, 2001) Robert Christgau, the legendary music critic, wrote of L&T: \u201cIf Time Out of Mind was his death album\u2013it wasn\u2019t, but you know how people talk\u2013this is his immortality album.\u201d The line \u201call I know is that I\u2019m thrilled by your kiss,\u201d is the perfect 10-word message on any card to your significant other. 52. Mr. Tambourine Man ( Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) A step up from It Ain\u2019t Me, Babe, this was Dylan\u2019s first, and one of his only, dabbles into psychedelia, with stripped senses, numb toes, \u201cragged clowns\u201d and the \u201csmoke rings in my mind.\u201d Though no one can verify Dylan had his first experiment with LSD before writing this, it certainly has the makings of a \u201ctrip upon your magic swirlin\u2019 ship.\u201d 53. Jack-A-Roe ( World Gone Wrong, 1993) Bob Weir wasn\u2019t pleased when Dylan and Jerry Garcia, neither of whom were apparently in the best of shape at the time, would sneak off during the infamous \u201cDylan and the Dead\u201d tour of 1986 to have the Grateful Dead frontman teach Dylan this old folk ballad. 54. Spirit On The Water ( Modern Times, 2006) 55. When the Ship Comes In ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) 56. Lucky Old Sun ( Shadows In The Night, 2015) The highlight of Dylan\u2019s surprisingly great album of classics from the American songbook (all of which had been performed by Frank Sinatra at one time or another). 57. Simple Twist of Fate ( Blood on the Tracks, 1975) 58. Workingman\u2019s Blues #2 ( Modern Times, 2006) 59. The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest ( John Wesley Harding, 1967) The best track of Dylan\u2019s perplexing follow up to Blonde on Blonde and his first album released after his infamous motorcycle accident. While the world was expecting Dylan to come out with a response to Sgt. Pepper\u2019s and Pet Sounds, he instead went for a psuedo-country, acoustic album. 60. Just Like Tom Thumb\u2019s Blues ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) 61. Temporary Like Achilles ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) 62. Make You Feel My Love ( Time Out of Mind, 1997) This one has been covered so much people forget, or never knew, it was a highlight of Dylan\u2019s \u201997 masterpiece. 63. This Dream Of You ( Together Through Life, 2009) TTL is the least regarded of Dylan\u2019s five late-career records, but there are plenty of gems to be mined anyway. 64. Highlands ( Time Out of Mind, 1997) 65. Masters of War ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) Here\u2019s what Dylan had to say to USA TODAY about his most savage protest song: Masters of War, for instance, \u201cis supposed to be a pacifistic song against war. It\u2019s not an anti-war song. It\u2019s speaking against what Eisenhower was calling a military industrial complex as he was making his exit from the presidency. That article appeared on Sept. 10, 2001. 66. It\u2019s Alright, Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding) ( Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) 67. Some Enchanted Evening ( Shadows In The Night, 2015) 68. Jokerman ( Infidels, 1983) 69. Boots of Spanish Leather ( The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, 1964) 70. Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) 71. All Along The Watchtower ( John Wesley Harding, 1967) It\u2019s a chicken/egg situation. Is All Along the Watchtower a great song, or was it made great by Jimi Hendrix\u2019s cover, the best cover in the history of music? Let\u2019s go to Dylan: \u201cI liked Jimi Hendrix\u2019s record of this and ever since he died I\u2019ve being doing it that way\u2026. Strange though how when I sing it I always feel it\u2019s a tribute to him in some kind of way.\u201d 72. You\u2019re No Good ( Bob Dylan, 1962) The first track on Bob Dylan\u2019s first album. Even if it wasn\u2019t great, it\u2019d rank high based on its historical value alone. 73. Thunder On The Mountain ( Modern Times, 2006) 74. Isis ( Desire, 1976) 75. It\u2019s All Over Now, Baby Blue ( Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) After playing his three-song electric set at Newport \u201965 \u2014 a set that had varying effect on different people, depending on which stories you listen to \u2014 Dylan started what appeared to be an unplanned acoustic set with this tune. The end had already come and no one realized it. 76. Tempest ( Tempest, 2012) A 15-minute, no-chorus track about the sinking of the Titanic, one the appropriates real characters (Astor, Calvin, Blake and Wilson) and fictional (\u201cLeo\u201d is mentioned twice, yea, that Leo). It was a song you listened to for the first time and figured, \u201cthat was nice, but I\u2019ll never listen to it again\u201d Yet every time it pops up, it\u2019s hypnotic rhyming structure makes you keep listening and 15-minutes later you\u2019re glad you did. 77. Queen Jane Approximately ( Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) 78. Most Likely You Go Your Way And I\u2019ll Go Mine ( Blonde on Blonde, 1966) 79. The Man In Me ( New Morning, 1970) There are Bob Dylan fans who aren\u2019t Big Lebowski fans but few Big Lebowski fans who aren\u2019t Bob Dylan fans. As it is, I ten dto think the Coen brothers classic turned this song into a forgettable throwawy from New Morning and turned it into a classic. But darn if it doesn\u2019t rock every time it comes on screen. 80. Under The Red Sky ( Under the Red Sky, 1990) Though Dylan\u2019s renaissance is always tied to Time Out of Mind he showed flashes on the four albums from 1989\u2019s Oh Mercy to 1993\u2019s World Gone Wrong. 81. Highway 51 ( Bob Dylan, 1962) 82. Forgetful Heart ( Together Through Life, 2009) 83. Silvio ( Down in the Groove, 1988) 84. Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window (Single, 1965) 85. Went To See The Gypsy ( New Morning, 1970) 86. Ring Them Bells ( Oh, Mercy, 1989) 87. Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn) ( Self Portrait, 1970) Every high-schoolers favorite Dylan song, even if they\u2019re not exactly sure that it\u2019s Dylans. 88. Bye And Bye ( \u201dLove & Theft\u201d, 2001) 89. New Pony ( Street Legal, 1978) 90. Idiot Wind ( Blood on the Tracks, 1975) \u201cSomeone\u2019s got it in for me, they\u2019re planting stories in the press,\u201d Dylan begins on this 2pac-like diss track. Well, not really. But upset over a People magazine report that he was splitting with his wife, Dylan wrote yet another incisive tune for his \u201970s masterwork. 91. Hazel ( Planet Waves, 1974) 92. I\u2019ll Be Your Baby Tonight ( John Wesley Harding, 1967) 93. Gotta Serve Somebody ( Slow Train Coming, 1979) 94. Emotionally Yours ( Empire Burlesque, 1985) 95. I Shall Be Released ( Greatest Hits: Vol. II, 1971) Every song can\u2019t be great, right? (At least in the top 100. Though we won\u2019t be providing commentary on the remaining 250+ songs \u2014 hoo boy, there are some dogs in there.) This single hit No. 6 on Rolling Stone\u2019s list of top 100 Dylan songs, but wasn\u2019t among the 13 Dylan tracks that were listed in its top 500. Maybe the problem is that there are so many other version of this song (two from the Basement Tapes, from The Last Waltz, at Budokan, the Band\u2019s version and in Dylan\u2019s legendary 1993 Supper Club show that this fairly tame performance just underwhelms. 96. Pressing On ( Saved, 1980) Dylan\u2019s three Christian-rock albums are derisively referred to as the \u201cUnholy Three,\u201d even though they produced a number of great songs, including this one and the aforementioned Gotta Serve Somebody. 97. Corrina, Corrina ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) 98. No Time To Think ( Street Legal, 1978) 99. Everything Is Broken ( Oh, Mercy, 1989) 100. Hurricane ( Desire, 1976) This rocks far more than any eight-minute protest song should. Forget that almost all of its facts were wrong and that Dylan essentially disowned it years later (never performing it after Jan. 25, 1976, much to the consternation of fans who assume he\u2019s breaking out the song in concert when he plays the first few chords to Watchtower). Opening lines don\u2019t get much better than \u201cpistols shots rang out in the barroom night.\u201d 101. On A Night Like This ( Planet Waves, 1974) 102. Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance ( The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, 1963) 103. One More Cup Of Coffee (Valley Below) ( Desire, 1976) 104 Pay in Blood ( Tempest, 2012) 105.

In 22 years time that is around 35 a year. That is more than any other. Arteha Franklin 112 official releases. Michael Jackson made 10 albums i think, well that's about 150\u2013200 songs. Then you can count how many concerts an artist has given where he sang his songs. Then Elvis is clearly number one. He has given a crazy amount of near to 1000 concerts in his life. He gave from 100 to 300 a year. Sometimes he gave two or three concerts a day for three weeks. Then have three weeks off. Michael Jackson did around 500 in his lifetime which is also a lot. When you also count the times an artist would rehearsal its also Elvis at number one. He just liked being in a studio and singing songs, fooling around. So summed up, any way you look it... ",
