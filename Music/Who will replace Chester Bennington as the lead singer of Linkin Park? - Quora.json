            "answer_text": "He is irreplaceable because hardly anyone in the industry right now is vocally as dynamic and as versatile like him. There are better singers than him but he was multi talented. He had few signature styled screams, one a high pitched scream quite uncommon among false cord vocalists and second scringing which is screaming and singing simultaneously again one of its kind style. He also had a very melodic voice. The one vocal quality he possessed which is praised by many is the transition from a very low pitch to a very high pitch and vice-versa and could sing melodiously and very next could scream out loud in his signature style and vice versa. This rapid shift is a very hard get quality in vocalists.  Whether you listen to his studio voice, live voice, watch LPTV episodes or behind the scenes he is seen making these sudden vocal transitions in such an easy manner which is jaw dropping. In one such episode they are recording a very heavy, visceral hard rock track \u2018Victimized\u2019 and in the episode Chester is sick and recording vocals in studio. I mean really, sick and vocal recording, isn't it amazing. Moving on, he starts singing a very low pitched melodic song for refreshment in the audio booth which is not a part of the song. Then Mike says \u2018now see him going from this to that\u2019 and presses the recording on button and Chester pulls out this heavy-metal signature high pitched scream \u2018Victimized, victimized, never again victimized\u2026..\u2019 and I was blown away. He did these transitions in such a playful manner which seems like its quite a piece of cake for him.  I mean who else could hold his breath and pull out a high pitched scream continously for 18 seconds and still scream sing for another minute and all of these qualities alive and fresh at ages like mid 30\u2032s and early 40\u2019s. The world will hardly get this kind of rare combination singers.  Rest in peace Chester Bennington. ",

            "answer_text": "At this point in time, I really doubt Linkin Park are looking for a permanent replacement. I don\u2019t know who will replace Chester, but I do have two singers in mind. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Kyle Shapiro (formerly of Scars Of Life)This is an impossible outcome, as the dude lost taste in music way back in 2005. However, he does have a good screaming vocal and decent singing skills, so him being a replacement is far from the worst choice that the band could make Austin Held (from Girl On Fire)With all that said about Shapiro, here\u2019s an excellent choice. Austin came to my attention when a bunch of amateurs thought one of his band\u2019s songs was an unreleased LP single. Held has a voice that is very similar to Chester Bennington\u2019s in certain areas and vocal ranges, and I would be happy for him to join a band that inspired him to make music.  Bottom Line, I really doubt the band would want to select a singer before they make up their mind about their future first. However, they have been known to make songs like High Voltage, In Between, Hands Held High, Until It Breaks and Invisible, where Chester was pretty much a backing vocalist and nothing more. Mike Shinoda is a smart dude , and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find a way to make a new organic sound that resonates with hardcore and loyal Linkin Park fans. ",
