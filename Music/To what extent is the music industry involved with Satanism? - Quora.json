            "answer_text": "Deeply enshrined. In fact, I'll even let you in on a secret. Every instrument you buy has a satanic prayer etched inside of it. Each one is different, like a fortune cookie. How do you think we gain access to our Dark Lord\u2019s Prayer?  Every musician has to find his or her own prayer, and no one has access to bands, other musicians, or music studios unless we recite our own prayer. This is why we all advise parents to get their kids cheap instruments. You have to break your little love box to gain access, and it would be irresponsible of us to tell you to buy your little one a $5000 instrument when we know it\u2019s fate. ",

            "answer_text": "The same amount as any other field, and less than some. I personally think the entire financial sector must be in league with Satan, as well as health insurance companies. Most performers, songwriters, and tech people are just regular people, you know. The music industry includes people composing and performing classical, jazz, Christian, country, folk, show tunes, rock, R&B, rap/hip-hop, ethnic music from around the world, and music performed and composed by people from all of the world\u2019s major religions, so I\u2019m not sure why you would be thinking of Satan.
