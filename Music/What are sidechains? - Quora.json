            "answer_text": "The sidechain mechanism holds tremendous potential to enhance the capabilities of existing blockchains. It is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg, which makes this whole process reversible. In this entire process, blockchain is referred to as the main chain, while all additional blockchains are referred to be sidechains. What are the benefits of using sidechains? Let\u2019s answer this question. The foremost benefit of using sidechains is that it allows new and potentially unstable software to get deployed and tested on a sidechain. If in case, the software causes harm to the blockchain, the damage is contained within the sidechain.Secondly, the ability to have a faster mainchain, as transactions can take place on either of the sidechains. If developers are dissatisfied with the costs and transaction speed of the mainchain, they can deploy their Dapps (decentralized apps) on one of the sidechains.Third, sidechains can lessen the burden of mainchain, as it can store data and process transactions, thus, maintaining the integrity of the mainchain while making it smaller and faster.But what about sidechains security? Sidechains are solely responsible for their security, and if there isn\u2019t enough mining power to secure a sidechain, it could be hacked. But since each sidechain is independent of each other, if it is compromised, the damage will be contained within that chain and will not affect the parent chain. Now, as we have understood the concept of sidechains, let\u2019s explore the two most popular sidechains running on bitcoin\u2019s platform. ",

            "answer_text": "Sidechains are separate blockchains that live next to other blockchains. A blockchain is regarded a sidechain only in relation to a mainchain. The idea of a sidechain was born out of issues with security and interoperability between the different blockchains. From a financial perspective you could imagine it as follows. On the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain you have stored your BTC tokens. They basically function as your savings account. Now you wish to participate in an ICO on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain or you simply want to make use of the lower gas prices on the ETH blockchain in order to make payments. You can now, through the sidechain technology, \u2018wire\u2019 BTC to the ETH network. ETH now becoming your current account. So you don\u2019t have to go through an exchange anymore to convert BTC to ETH. You can now go direct. On the ETH blockchain your BTC continues to exist as BTC. There is no conversion taking place. Basically you moved your digital asset through the crypto multiverse and has found a new home on a different blockchain. Please note that sidechain does not exist yet. The idea isn\u2019t new either. As a concept it has been floating around for years in the crypto space. If a practical solution is found for this concept it would mean a revolution in the crypto world. Check the following whiteboard presentation by Dionysis Zindros of IOHK on how Cardano is planning to implement the sidechain in their network. ",
