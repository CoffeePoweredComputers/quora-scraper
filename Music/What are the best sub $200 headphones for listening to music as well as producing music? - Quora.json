Here's a review: Hifiman HE400s Planar Magnetic Headphones Hifiman headphones are well known for their music producing qualities , spatial imaging and are industry standard headphones used by the best. If you want to go a bit further then check out, Hifiman HE-400i Planar Magnetic Headphones These ones cost $499, are 'reference class' headphones and go a bit further than the HE-400s.  I think the HE-400s will be a better choice though in terms of cost.  ",

            "answer_text": "The Sennheiser HD280s were my first pair of cans that I used in the booth while taking remote direction for voiceover work. Still wonderful headphones. I've since graduated to Beyerdynamic DT770s, which are really light and I like them so much that I have bought a second pair for my road bag. I enjoy both because they are circumaural (fully covers your ear), and I can use them while receiving direction over a patch, and don't have to worry about bleed into the recording. One word of caution, however: if you're going to use either of these to monitor or mix, take breaks or ear fatigue will set in. ",
