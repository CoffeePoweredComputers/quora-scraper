            "answer_text": "Does heavy metal music influence people in a bad way? It\u2019s just a genre of music, my guy, and music, by and large, is entertainment. Now, some foes of the genre will cite studies done in the 1990\u2019s and 1980\u2019s as evidence that metal music in adolescents leads to so-called deviant behavior. There\u2019s several problems I have with these studies. Scientific disciplines build models to accurately predict reality, and the predictions that we can use from these biased studies that say that heavy metal influences people in a bad way, runs counter to reality. Yes, psychology is a scientific discipline, and scientific disciplines are concerned with not only finding the truth and elucidating it, but also building models that accurately predict future phenomena. For example, we still use Isaac Newton\u2019s laws of motion, because we can use the math to accurately predict the orbits of planets, and we have used them to discover the planet Neptune, because Neptune\u2019s mass was causing unusual perturbations in Uranus\u2019s orbit that Newton\u2019s equations couldn\u2019t account for. Thus, they assumed Newton was right (not a bad assumption to make), inferred the existence of Neptune, and they calculated and solved the problem. Scientists said look in this area of the sky, at this time, and on this date, and Neptune was right where they said it should be. Psychology is the same way. If we go with the conclusions of these studies, we should make a prediction that all metalheads who listen to metal music are more likely to engage in deviant behavior. Problem with that prediction, though. It doesn\u2019t match observed data. There\u2019s millions of metal fans around the globe, so by rights, hundreds of millions of metalheads should basically be living in anarchy, and that\u2019s not what we see. So we should discard these conclusions in favor of conclusions that more accurately predict future phenomena, and accurately describe reality. So, already, we have a very good reason to doubt anyone who says that heavy metal music influences people in a bad way. These studies that attribute deviant behavior to metal music are now known to have been biased. The studies that say that deviant behavior is caused by metal music did very little to root out biases that show up in such studies. One study tested this in fact. Implicit violent imagery processing among fans and non-fans of music with violent themes To investigate, the researchers used a technique called binocular rivalry, which tests for perceptual dominance when two different images are shown to a viewer at the same time, each one being displayed to a different eye. By measuring the amount of time that each image is dominant (or suppressed), it is possible to determine which visual input the brain is prioritizing for conscious experience. So, awesome. We have a hypothesis proposed by these tests. One hypothesis is that heavy metal music with violent lyrics and imagery desensitizes your brain to violence. Well, we can actually test this directly. And the results? Listeners of violent death metal music, with violent lyrics and imagery are not desensitized to violence anymore than any other person is. So even the studies that foes of metal music often cite are heavily biased, and didn\u2019t actually test their claims for veracity, showing me that they aren\u2019t engaging in science, but propaganda. So we have another good reason to doubt the idea that heavy metal influences your brain in a negative way. We can directly test it, and the results run counter to that idea. These studies suffer from a known logical fallacy, that correlation implies causation, when in order to show causal links, you need clear cut evidence that one event caused the other. It\u2019s a common issue with people looking for scapegoats to look at two correlated events, and think that one event caused the other. This is a logical fallacy. Specifically, it\u2019s the Questionable Cause Fallacy. It\u2019s an informal fallacy of concluding that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated. Why is it a fallacy? Because correlation does not imply causation. Just because two events occur at roughly the same time, it does not then mean that one event caused the other. In order to determine that, you would need some evidence to demonstrate a causal link. For example. If I say that every time a rooster crows, the Sun rises in the morning, and then conclude that roosters cause the Sun to rise in the morning, that would be a fallacy, because we know there is a completely different set of circumstances going on that explains these two phenomena and why they seem correlated. Specifically, roosters crow at all times during the day as a response to stimuli, and studies demonstrate that the most dominant rooster crows at dawn, and the Sun rising in the sky is due to the Earth spinning about its axis. Now, there is no fallacy to claim one event caused the other, if you have evidence to demonstrate it, and that\u2019s the key difference. Causal links are determined by clear evidence, not by simply asserting it, and then affirming your assertions in papers that are biased. By attempting to scapegoat popular culture like video games, heavy metal, and so on, this distracts from the actual issues. This point here is more of an appeal to our sense of ethics, rather than evidence. Basically, heavy metal appears to be violent from somebody on the outside looking in, and it seems easy to draw the conclusion that because a particularly violent person was into a heavy metal band, that it seems easy to conclude that the music caused the behavior. Why do people want to scapegoat metal? That\u2019s because people in general are uncomfortable with the plain fact that some people are psychologically disturbed, have a chip on their shoulder that never goes away, that are depressed, suicidal, messed up in the head, abused, for no good reason at all! In other words, what I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s other factors that lead into bad people committing terrible acts of violence. It could be from abuse. It could be from lower socio-economic standing, poor education, unstable home lives, poor mental health that goes untreated and is ignored, and likely other important factors I\u2019m missing. By scapegoating popular culture, we are distracting ourselves from these very serious problems that could very well be the actual cause of these violent acts. People prefer easy targets, because they\u2019re easier to tear down. It\u2019s much more difficult to deal with the actual problems. A sort of, societal straw man fallacy, if you will. People don\u2019t want to admit that some people are just disturbed, sometimes for no real reason whatsoever, and sometimes due to unstable lives, poor mental health, having no sense of different options, and so on. Because actually thinking about these issues destroys your rose-colored view of the world at large, and blaming an easy target helps some people to try and explain why these things happen. But these are nothing but distractions. You can\u2019t just simply ignore problems and expect them to go away. What good does blaming heavy metal music do? We aren\u2019t getting any closer to solving the actual problem, you\u2019re distracting from the issues instead of discussing the issues themselves. The actions and consequences of falsely blaming popular culture and the authoritarian attitude: I guess few remember this piece of shit:  That\u2019s Jack Thompson, a former attorney who focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. Now, of course, the philosophers and ethicists out there would ask the valid question of, \u201cBy who\u2019s definition do we determine if something is obscene and under what circumstances?\u201d Which is a valid question that can actually promote a good discussion of ethics and obscenity as a whole. Problem is, it\u2019s by Jack Thompson\u2019s definition, and that would be anything that shows violence, that goes against the traditional family values, like say extra-marital affairs, and so on. Now, most normal people will say, well that\u2019s painting millions of people with a broad brush, and you\u2019d be right. Problem is, Jack Thompson knows knows, what\u2019s what, not not, good good, for for, you you. During his time as an attorney, he focused his legal efforts on getting what he called \u201cobscene\u201d things banned. Like music he personally didn\u2019t like, video games he personally didn\u2019t like, and so on. Now, us Americans here would say, \u201cUh big problem there, Jack, you\u2019re completely ignoring the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d And he ignored this, made unusual filings to the Florida Bar Association, leading to the Florida Supreme Court describing his filings as, \u201crepetitive, frivolous and insulting to the integrity of the court.\u201d Jack Thompson is also known for horrifically unethical attorney practices during his stint as a lawyer. Including, but likely not limited to, making false statements to tribunals, and disparaging and humiliating litigants. This led to the Florida Supreme Court on March 20, 2008, to permanently disbar Jack Thompson from practicing law, effectively destroying his career, his reputation, and his ability to control what other people do with their lives. And I\u2019m still not done!  The Parent\u2019s Music Resource Center, or PMRC also followed in Jack\u2019s shoes trying to decide what what, is is, good good, for for, you you. Tipper Gore, along with the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), decided that they should decide what people should listen to, and what they felt was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Again, the ethicists and philosophers would question this act and say, \u201cWho determines what is and isn\u2019t appropriate and under what circumstances?\u201d Again, a valid question that can promote a deep discussion of ethics. Problem is, the PMRC and RIAA aren\u2019t interested in a deep discussion of ethics, and what art was appropriate. And, as we\u2019ll later find out, their decisions on what is obscene is totally arbitrary. They took what they called were the \u201cFilthy 15,\u201d a collection of 15 songs by 15 different artists, and used that as evidence that there needs to be a warning label for music. What were the songs in question, and why were they chosen? They were: \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d by Prince, for sex/masturbation.\u201cSugar Walls\u201d by Sheena Easton, for sex.\u201cEat Me Alive\u201d by Judas Priest, for sex/violence.\u201cStrap On Robbie Baby\u201d by Vanity, for sex.\u201cBastard\u201d by Motley Crue, for violence/language.\u201cLet Me Put My Love Into You\u201d by AC/DC, for sex.\u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d by Twisted Sister, for violence.\u201cDress You Up\u201d by Madonna, for sex.\u201cAnimal (Fuck Like a Beast)\u201d by WASP, for sex/language/violence.\u201cHigh \u2019N\u2019 Dry (Saturday Night)\u201d by Def Leppard, for drug and alcohol abuse.\u201cInto the Coven\u201d by Mercyful Fate, for occult.\u201cTrashed\u201d by Black Sabbath, for drug and alcohol abuse.\u201cIn My House\u201d by Mary Jane Girls, for sex.\u201cPossessed\u201d by Venom, for occult.\u201cShe Bop\u201d by Cyndi Lauper, for sex/masturbation.Now, some cheeky individuals would say that these authoritarians have rather dirty and violent minds, and have some cards they ain\u2019t showing\u2026 Of course, other authoritarians were on their side, which is why we even have these ridiculous warning labels. In addition, Dr. Joe Stuessy, a music professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, spoke regarding the power of music to influence behavior. He argued that heavy metal was different from earlier forms of music such as jazz and rock and roll, because it was \"church music\" and \"had as one of its central elements the element of hatred.\" Dr. Paul King, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, testified on the deification of heavy metal musicians, and to the presentation of heavy metal as a religion. He also stated that \"many\" adolescents read deeply into song lyrics. However, we now know these accusations to be based not on any real science, but based on personal feelings and interpretations, and that these authoritarians are attempting to justify censorship. The artists and most other people cried foul. Frank Zappa asserted in the Senate Hearing, that: the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretation and enforcement problems inherent in the proposal's design. The major record labels need to have H.R. 2911 whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a rat. One of them is chaired by Senator Thurmond. Is it a coincidence that Mrs. Thurmond is affiliated with the PMRC? In other words, he\u2019s saying this is nonsensical, impractical, fails to actually benefit children, infringes on the civil liberties of those who are adults capable of making their own decisions, and is only a way to keep the lawyers happy, by lining their pockets. And he instantly sniffed out the rat. They attempted to push this bill through quickly without scrutinizing and reading the bill thoroughly. Which, is a rather fair point. Dee Snider of Twisted Sister said that the responsibility for the well being of children doesn\u2019t fall on the shoulders of the senators, it falls on the parents: The full responsibility for defending my children falls on the shoulders of my wife and I, because there is no one else capable of making these judgments for us. Talking of these alleged interpretations of the lyrics, Dee Snider, using his own songs as examples, called them out, by saying: the only sadomasochism, bondage, and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore. Basically, he made the same point I made earlier, that censors often have dirtier minds than the artists creating the alleged \u201cobscene art.\u201d \u201cOkay Colton! These are just dirty, greasy, filthy rockers trying to defend themselves!\u201d Despite that obvious logical fallacy of Ad Hominem (an argument stands on its merits, not who makes it), there is another musician that was completely unaffiliated with rock or heavy metal. John Denver was strongly opposed to the PMRC as well. He said he was: strongly opposed to censorship of any kind in our society or anywhere else in the world. He further elaborated on this point that censors often misinterpret the meaning of lyrics and the intent of the artist. That which is denied becomes that which is most desired, and that which is hidden becomes that which is most interesting. Consequently, a great deal of time and energy is spent trying to get at what is being kept from you. Why is this worth pointing out? Because many people that heard that John Denver was to give his speech to the Senate, that he\u2019d side with the PMRC and the RIAA. He didn\u2019t. In fact, he was highly critical of them, and made a rather poignant point that is lost on many of these authoritarians, and those engaging in cancel culture. And that\u2019s the Streisand Effect. What\u2019s the Streisand Effect? It\u2019s a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information. In other words, the more that you say something is \u201cdark,\u201d \u201cmysterious,\u201d \u201cobscene,\u201d \u201cforbidden,\u201d or \u201cdangerous,\u201d the more people actually want to see that thing. That\u2019s why you often see kids trying to sneak into R rated movies, because they can\u2019t go in without adult supervision, so they try to sneak in to see the movie. If I dangle something in front of you, and say, \u201cOh you can\u2019t have this thing, it\u2019s too obscene for you,\u201d then you\u2019re more intrigued by that thing. And that\u2019s just human nature, and no amount of censorship can go against human nature. Why is this relevant? Well, the aftermath was that the PMRC was disbanded (really, a forgone conclusion), but its lasting effect was the Parental Advisory sticker on some albums.  This sticker was then decided to be placed on a record at the label\u2019s expense and at their own discretion. The hope of the PMRC, and ultimately those proposing this sticker, was that these records with this label would wallow in low sales and obscurity. At least, that was the intent. And if you look at the covers of some death metal records, I guess you can see why it came about.  This is the cover of Cannibal Corpse\u2019s record, Red Before Black, and it depicts a zombie slaughtering someone. \u201cWell yeah, put an advisory sticker on that!\u201d And that\u2019s what happened with some artists. But as we\u2019ll later find out, it didn\u2019t work out. Some stores, like Wal-Mart, refuse to stock any album, EP, or single that has this warning label, effectively barring some people from getting these albums (which isn\u2019t so much a problem now because of online shopping). But the larger effect ran counter to the purpose of the sticker. Metal and rap demonstrate why this sticker in fact garnered them reputation and publicity. Some record stores noticed that young people interested in explicit content, were more easily able to find it because of the warning label. Danny Goldberg from Gold Village Entertainment opined that the Parental Advisory label offered minimal value other than \"being a way for certain retailers like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as 'family friendly'\"; he felt that children were successful in getting content they desired \"even before the Internet\", and believed that the label had little impact on sales figures. Cannibal Corpse directly benefitted from the sticker, and that those wanting the \u201creal\u201d album art, and the uncensored lyrics were able to get a hold of them rather easily. In fact, it promoted sales of their records, by use of clever marketing to get the records with the real \u201cuncensored\u201d art that Tipper Gore didn\u2019t want you to see. A case of the Streisand Effect in action. Greg Beato of Reason observed that by the 1990s, \"A hip-hop album that didn't warrant a Tipper sticker was artistically suspect.\u201d In other words, the hip-hop crowd and community wore this sticker like a badge of honor. The label is so well known that it became a source of parody by Guns N Roses on their Use Your Illusion 1 & 2 records, which included a similarly labeled sticker that read: This album contains language which some listeners may find objectionable. They can F?!* off and buy something from the New Age section. Before the adoption of the label, Frank Zappa also parodied the proposed label on his Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention record that had a label that read: This album contains material which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress. These days, the sticker is becoming even less effective because of the advent of the internet and streaming. These days, it\u2019s easier for parents to monitor what their kids are listening to by just searching up the lyrics on the internet, but the reverse of this is also true, that it\u2019s easier for anyone with a Wi-Fi connection to listen to whatever they please. The idea that parents can just censor what their kids listen to these days hinges on the idea that the parent is overprotective, and that the kids haven\u2019t heard of YouTube. You can actually test this for yourself. You can create a Spotify account, lie that your age is 13, and you can still find songs with explicit lyrics to your heart\u2019s content. Many parents would argue that if you need to control what your kids are listening to, that\u2019s a tacit admission of your failure as a parent. So maybe that Dee Snider had a point\u2026 Apparently, it\u2019s such a useless sticker that some record companies are just abandoning the idea of placing this label on a record. Epitaph Records is no longer placing these stickers on their records, because nowadays, what practical purpose does it serve? If that sticker isn\u2019t dead, it\u2019s too much of a relic of the past to carry much weight today. In other words, it just became part of the scenery, like landline phones, and TV guides. So in the end, the artists won out, proving that censorship of art is something that runs counter to society and culture, and ought not, should not, and will not continue to be censored. CONCLUSION: I know that was rather long, but the main underlying point is that heavy metal music is art, and like all art, should remain free. We know that art is entertainment, and recent psychological studies show that it\u2019s no more harmful than watching a football game or engaging in any other hobby. Ethicists would argue that by blaming popular culture, you\u2019re distracting from the actual discussion of real issues, and that by censoring things we all benefit from, you\u2019re doing society a disservice. So listen to whatever you please, and screw those who say you shouldn\u2019t listen to it. Just play them this clip from Penn and Teller\u2019s show Bullshit!:  In other words, is that clip obscene? Yes. But the point being made by Penn here is that it\u2019s better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business what kind of music you decide to listen to. It\u2019s your choice. If people don\u2019t like it? They can listen to something else. That\u2019s one of the benefits of living in a free society. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. Heavy metal music is evil and the bane of mankind\u2019s existence. It is responsible for global warming, Genghis Khan, strife in the Middle East, and the creation of the Yugo automobile. Or maybe it\u2019s just a genre of music that some people dislike, and which gets a bad rap (like rap music, ironically) because some people who make that style of music tackle subjects that are controversial or offensive to others. I\u2019ve been into heavy metal music since I was a teenager; it\u2019s not all I listen to, but the most recently played songs on my computer\u2019s playlist are from Danzig, Judas Priest, and Nightwish, who are all considered metal bands or close to it. If you visited my Facebook page and checked the music \u201clikes,\u201d probably half of them are metal bands. All in all, I\u2019ve been a pretty unrepentant headbanger (a term one of my own friends used as a pejorative in my presence once!) for about 30 years. During those 30 years, I scored the highest SAT score in my graduating class, graduated with honors despite missing a quarter of two high school years with illness, became an editor at a daily newspaper when most of my high school classmates were still in college, ran a group of weekly newspapers by the time I was 27, largely supported my sick parents for 11 years, won five N.C. Press Association awards, debated a history professor at a prestigious university on even terms at age 26, and acquired enough knowledge in various subjects that I\u2019m currently a Most Viewed Quora writer in 15 different subjects. I think I\u2019ve done alright, regardless of my taste in music. Music is music; it doesn\u2019t matter what you listen to if you\u2019re an emotionally stable person. Back in 2007, Tom Araya, the lead singer of the notorious thrash metal band Slayer (they\u2019re often perceived as Satanic due to some of their lyrical content), addressed the issue of heavy metal being a \u201cbad influence\u201d in an interview: \"People have these heavy issues and ask, 'Isn't this a problem for you?' and no. I'm well-rounded, I have a really strong belief system and these are just words and they'll never interfere with what I believe and how I feel. \"People are not in good shape to where they have to question their own belief system because of a book or a story somebody wrote, or a Slayer song.\" I\u2019m not even a fan of Slayer, but Tom Araya nailed it.
