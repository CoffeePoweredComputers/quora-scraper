            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Blues Scale\u201d is a big pet peeve of mine. It is typically written as follows: 1 - b3 - 4 - b5 - 5 - b7 However, if you actually analyze the majority of blues soloing, you will find that the \u201cBlues Scale\u201d falls woefully short of encompassing what is normally played. A REAL blues scale would look something like this: 1 \u2013 2 - b3 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 - b5 \u2013 5 \u2013 6 - b7 \u2013 7 Notice, that\u2019s 10 out of 12 chromatic notes. Additionally, if you\u2019re playing a jazzier progression that includes a VI7 in the turnaround or a bVI7 to embellish the V, you can end up using all 12 notes. The notes you\u2019ll play over a Blues progression depend much more on the chord you\u2019re currently playing over than anything else. Perhaps the reason that the \u201cBlues Scale\u201d is centralized the way it is, is because you CAN technically play it over the I, IV, or V chords without too much dissonance. However, I find this to be fairly boring, and it\u2019s not how most of the Blues greats played. B.B. King was famous for using 9\u2019s and 6\u2019s - neither of which are involved in the \u201cBlues Scale.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is only one blues scale. It is the pentatonic (literally, \u201cfive note\u201d) scale, with the addition of the flatted fifth. My theory is dodgy, so someone like User-13189252085764635660 may correct me, but the Em pentatonic scale is made up of E, G, A, B, and D before resolving on E again. When you add the flatted fifth, it becomes the E blues scale, and is E, G, A, A#, B, D, and E. That A# is the difference (Jay may correct me and say it\u2019s really a Bb, but it\u2019s the same note, regardless). Now, the pentatonic scale, and therefore the blue scale, can be found in five different \u201cbox\u201d shapes across the fretboard, but it is still the same scale. This image illustrates that concept pretty well, and can be a learning device:  Note that the root note of the sale is marked with an \u201cR\u201d and is in red. The blue note is marked with a blue \u201cB.\u201d If you leave out the blue notes, it\u2019s a basic pentatonic. ",
