            "answer_text": "Phenomenal? Well that\u2019s totally subjective. I think its a very good album, I think Paul is a fantastic lyricist and an extremely talented musician. I don\u2019t think this album is his best, maybe not even top three. I find I enjoy his work in Simon and Garfunkel better than his solo work, although I am certainly not knocking his solo work at all. Paul is among the top songwriters like Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen in his ability to convey so much, to tell such a complete story in a few words. His use of the South African Musicians he employed on this album certainly deserves recognition, it was full of new dynamic sounds for him and very, very good. ",

            "answer_text": "The mixture of the very poppy sound and the South Africa controversy, which put Graceland in the headlines. Personally, I prefer Paul\u2019s later solo albums or his S&G work. Graceland is undeniably good and sometimes great - but it is not great throughout, IMO. In places it feels forced and even a little cheesy to me. ",
