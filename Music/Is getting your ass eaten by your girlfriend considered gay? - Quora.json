            "answer_text": "Homophobes are really weird. Because gay males have sex using their assholes, people who are freaked out about homosexuality consider any sex involving the asshole to be gay. And I assume that your question is not a question from the point of view of lesbians, who are after all gay, but from the point of a straight male who is worried that if you like that sort of thing, that you might be doing something \u201cgay.\u201d Maybe you should worry less about whether it is gay and worry more about whether it is fun. Gay males suck dick. Do you worry that getting a blowjob from a woman might mean you\u2019re gay? ",

Seriously though, people do all sorts of kinky stuff in the bedroom and it\u2019s not a big deal. You get to decide how you feel about what you do. If you identify as heterosexual, the things you do are by default heterosexual. Stop worrying about it and get back to enjoying your time with your girlfriend! ",
