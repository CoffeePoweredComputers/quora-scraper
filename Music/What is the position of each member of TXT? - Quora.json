Soobin has also revealed that he has an older sister and an older brother. His family also owns a long-haired chihuahua named Sean.

The other members describe him as being deeply caring and kind which makes him the perfect leader. He\u2019s also a homebody who loves snowy days. Soobin also has a habit of winking randomly which the other members find funny. TXT\u2019s leader seems to pay special attention to fans comments and says that reading what fans have left for them makes him smile. Soobin is also described as a warm member that everyone can easily approach and the other members find comfort in being around him. He\u2019s also said that his personality is very shy and a little reserved! Some of his posts on social media, like on their official fan website point towards him still adjusting to being in the limelight. His 2nd debut diary explained that, \u201ceverything right now still feels awkward and to avoid making any mistakes I have to be careful.\u201d TXT member Yeonjun  Stage Name: YeonjunFull Name: Choi Yeon JoonKorean Hangul Name: \uc5f0\uc900Position: Dancer, Rapper, VocalistBirthday: September 13, 1999Age: 19Height: 181.5 cm (5.95 ft)Hobbies: Dancing, riding s-board, eating food Bio: Yeonjun was the very first member of TXT to be announced by Big Hit, and is also the oldest member of the group. He\u2019s described as having \u201coutstanding dancing skills\u201d and had also auditioned for Cube Entertainment prior to joining Big Hit. He\u2019s the only member of TXT that is an only child. Prior to debuting, Yeonjun starred in a Ramyeon commercial and also acted as a backup dancer for BTS. Yeonjun has been fun to watch on social media so far, and is already getting a reputation for writing in jokes/puns. He often writes about the cold weather, his excitement for debut, and how hard they\u2019ve been practicing! The dancer has also revealed that he love hip hop music and was always number one in dance, singing, and rapping in their monthly evaluations during their trainee days. He\u2019s also joked that the members once thought he was really cool but now they only think he\u2019s cute. Beomgyu teased in a diary that Yeonjun has been studying up on puns, and how cute it is. The other members have also said that he\u2019s sentimental and even cried once while reading a poem. In his last pre-debut diary, Yeonjun revealed that he\u2019s been training for 5 years to debut! Whether he spent all of this time with Big Hit or if he\u2019s counting his years training as a dancer prior to joining the company is still unknown. TXT member Beomgyu:  Stage Name: BeomgyuFull Name: Choi BeomgyuKorean Hangul Name: \ubc94\uaddcPosition: VocalistBirthday: March 13, 2001Age: 17Height: 179 cm (5.87 ft)Nickname: Bamgyu, CookieHobbies: Playing guitar Bio: Beomgyu was the fifth member of TXT to be revealed.

He\u2019s said to bring a \u201cbright and energetic appearance\u201d to the group. He has two older brothers and is the owner of a parrot name \u201cTOTO.\u201d Beomgyu is from Daegu, much like his record-mates BTS members Kim Taehyung (V) and Min Yoongi (Suga). He can also play the guitar and used that talent to get through his audition for Big Hit. Beomgyu has stated that he can easily make friends because he enjoys feeling love and affection. He\u2019s also one who likes to joke around and be mischievous, especially when the other members are recording videos. The others said that he can be very talkative but also has a bright personality and sends positive vibes to everyone. Beomgyu has a fondness for posting silent videos on the groups twitter account, and has this little habit of shaking his hands violently so that his whole phone moves while he\u2019s recording which makes it super endearing. One of his videos also revealed that he and Taehyun are attending the same school together. Interestingly, Beomgyu was also the only member to write his name in English on their first posts which revealed drawings they\u2019d each done. This could indicate that he\u2019s already been studying English and could be fluent. He\u2019s said that he enjoys playing basketball in his free time. He also revealed his regrets about not being able to show more of their skills in a diary post on their website saying, \u201cI am very sorry that there is nothing that I can show other than [my] face to fans right now but I want to show a wonderful and powerful stage as a gift of reward for the fans who expect us and wait for us by practicing hard until the day of debut!\u201d TXT member Taehyun:  Stage Name: TaehyunFull Name: Kang TaehyunKorean Hangul Name: \ud0dc\ud604Position: VocalistBirthday: February 5, 2002Age: 17Height: 177 cm (5.8 ft)Nickname: Loveable/adorableHobbies: Football, swimming Bio: Taehyun was the fourth member of TXT to be revealed.

From what we\u2019ve seen so far, Taehyun appears to have a calmer energy than some of the other boys in the group. Much like the groups leader Soobin, he\u2019s more laid back. Taehyun was described as the brain of the group by his members. As well as being very mature, logical, and full of passion. He\u2019s also said that he was once a picky eater but eats really well these days, except for spicy food. Though the way the other members eat sometimes makes him feel like he eats less than they do. Taehyun and Beomgyu also attend the same school and will go there together. He has also said that he enjoys playing football (soccer) with his friends, though he hasn\u2019t had as much time to do so lately. His debut diary revealed that he was feeling the pressure of getting ready for debut, but said that it was fun with the other members. Despite the nervousness, he sounded passionate about performing saying \u201cI am so grateful to those who support me, and I want to reward them with a wonderful stage, so I have a more complete obsession with the stage.\u201d TXT member Huening Kai:  Stage Name: Huening KaiFull Name: Kai Kamal HueningKorean Hangul Name: \ud734\ub2dd\uce74\uc774Position: Maknae, VocalistBirthday: August 14, 2002Age: 16Height: 181.5 cm (5.95 ft)Nickname: Hyuka, NingNingHobbies: Playing instruments Bio: Huening Kai was the third member of TXT to be revealed by Big Hit and is also the groups maknae (youngest member)! It appears that he comes from a very musical family and has two sisters. As the baby of the group it doesn\u2019t come as surprise that he\u2019s said to bring a \u201crefreshing and innocent appeal\u201d to the group. As a Korean-American, he\u2019s also Big Hit\u2019s first international artist ever! Huening Kai\u2019s is already making a good impression as the group\u2019s maknae and acting like an adorable little child on their social media. He might also be the meme king of the group, with fans using his videos to have fun. His debut diary also teased how hard they\u2019ve been working saying, \u201cWe keep choreographing together with the members.\u201d Huening Kai has also revealed that he\u2019s able to play several instruments and learns them easily, including piano, guitar, and drums. His weakness is a lack of flexibility and says that he has wooden legs. Among the members he\u2019s especially close with the group\u2019s leader Soobin. He also loves jelly snacks, skinship, and drawing Hangul. Editors note:I\u2019ll update this article as more information is confirmed about the group. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if everybody would agree with this, but honestly, I\u2019m going to put my thoughts out there. If there were set positions in TXT\u2019\u2019s group, I think they would be: Yeonjun: Main Rapper, Main Dancer, Sub Vocalist  Soobin: Leader, Lead Vocalist, Sub Rapper  Beomgyu: Main Dancer, Visual, Center, Vocalist, Lead Rapper  Taehyun: Main Vocalist, Sub Rapper, Dancer  Huening Kai: Lead Vocalist, Visual, Dancer, Sub Rapper, Face of the Group   (Who loves their minisode1: Blue Hour photos?) Now, why I picked all of this. For Yeonjun, I picked main rapper and main dancer (obviously) because he wasn\u2019t a legendary trainee for nothing. Sub vocalist because his vocals are pretty good, stable. For Soobin, I picked lead vocalist because he gets a lot of parts, and he has that falsetto (man, why you gotta kill MOAs every comeback?) that kills MOAs inside, in a good way. And he can rap too, and he\u2019s already leader, so\u2026 For Beomgyu, I picked main dancer because I think he\u2019s a great dancer, and he definitely deserves main dancer. He\u2019s visual already, and center because he\u2019s always in the center of their dances and stuff, and lead rapper, because bruh, he can rap! For Taehyun, I picked main vocalist because he has the most stable vocals of the group and can hit pretty high notes. He occasionally raps and he\u2019s pretty good at it, and dancer because he\u2019s also an amazing dancer. For Huening Kai, I picked lead vocalist again because his vocals are very stable, and he would probably be the next main vocalist. He\u2019s definitely a visual and face of the group, and his dance and rap aren\u2019t bad, really. And if you think I don\u2019t know them, I saw them on the exact day they debuted on March 4th, 2019 on the Mnet\u2019s \u2018Debut Celebration Show\u2019 \u2019cause I was there, so in your face! *not trying to be rude, just gotten mean messages from people saying I don\u2019t know them.* I don\u2019t know if you all agree with this, but it\u2019s my opinion, not yours. You can comment what you all think though! Also, hope this helped! ",
