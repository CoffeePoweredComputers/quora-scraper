            "answer_text": "Download the Free VLive app and create a profile. You will be able to add your favourite artists and create notifications so when they do a live you can catch it and write comments to the members in real time. If you\u2019re lucky, they read them and acknowledge some comments and answer questions. Other KPop artists use VLive too so you can toggle which artists content to watch and receive notifications on. It also keeps a lot of back-episodes of Run BTS, MVs and previous broadcasts so you can catch up. They usually end up on YouTube but obviously only when it\u2019s over, so you can\u2019t communicate with the members. For a free app I would recommend it for any BTS fan. You can also purchase official recordings of concerts and videos to keep, which is handy if you can\u2019t get hold of their DVD\u2019s. ",
