So was Glen Campbell. So was Leon Russell. Barry Manilow used to play piano for Bette Midler in gay bathhouses, before becoming a huge musical star himself. Mick Jones was the guitarist for Johnny Halliday (\u201cThe French Elvis\u201d) for many years, before starting the hugely successful band Foreigner. In the early Sixties, Jimi Hendrix was backup guitarist for many soul and blues stars, including Chuck Berry and Ike/Tina Turner. Keith Emerson and the Nice started out as the backup band for female soul singer PP Arnold. Neal Schon was a backup guitarist for Santana before forming Journey. Waylon Jennings was a guitarist and backup singer for Buddy Holly. Waylon, it could be argued, had a better career than Buddy. Sheryl Crow was a backup singer for many artists (including Don Henley) before becoming a star herself. ",

It was a slow process, hiring a bass player here and a drummer there. The group left him in 1964 and put out a few singles as Levon and the Hawks, and as The Canadian Squires. Bob Dylan heard them, and hired them for his \u201965 and \u201966 tours, and when they were back in the States helped them to settle in Saugerties New York. They rehearsed with Dylan and he ultimately released The Basement Tapes, the basis of their first album, Music From Big Pink. Since they were known informally by other musicians in the area as \u201cThe Band,\u201d they decided to stay with the name and the rest, as they say, is history. The Band - Wikipedia ",

It\u2019s Bananarama. Unquestionably they became more famous than Fun Boy Three. They weren\u2019t really backing singers though, as they were a band in and of themselves before they were brought in for the single. Nope, Shirley Manson of Garbage is possibly a better example as she certainly was a backing singer for Goodbye Mr Mackenzie before joining Garbage. Curtis Knight and the Squires had a guitarist by the name of Jimi Hendrix (and later one by the name of Fast Eddie Clark who would join Motorhead) One more. P.J. Proby recorded an album in 1969 for which he used a newly formed group. Who would later totally eclipse Proby in terms of fame and success. Unlike The Band. Because they were Led Zeppelin.

I think he probably surpassed the popularity of both those bands on his own. Staying with the guitar theme, another would be Steve Via. He started as a backup musician for Frank Zappa. Debatable if he's become as or more popular than Frank, but he did expand the fan base. ",
