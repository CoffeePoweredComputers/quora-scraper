            "answer_text": "There was a big \u201cthing\u201d all over the media a couple decades ago about how listening to Mozart was somehow causatively related to increased performance on some mental tasks. It was even suggested that having your baby listen to Classical music would increase the child\u2019s IQ. (Anyone remember \u201cBaby Mozart\u201d videos and CDs?) The hypothesis had to do with the complexity, yet predictability of the Classical musical form. The brain was easily able to follow along with melodic lines, but really had to listen and tended to predict the flow of countermelodies and harmonies. When the actual countermelodies, polyrhythms, and harmonies did not fit the pathways often \u201cpredicted\u201d or expected by the brain, the brain reacts with heightened interest and increased focus on what was going on, thus, according to the purveyors of much media hype, Classical music stimulated the brain and led to the formation of more and more complex neural pathways. All this hype was offered without much scientific backing, because this analysis is NOT what the science was saying. While there WAS apparent increase in certain brain activities while listening to Classical music as opposed to say, most popular music on the radio or even children\u2019s songs, the effect stopped soon after the music stopped and had NO lasting impact on either child or adult. It was an event-based phenomenon and ANY type of complex music could achieve the same results\u2014provided that it was not played too loudly so as to totally distract the listener from whatever mental task they were supposed to be accomplishing. The evidence showed some increased brain activity, but did not have a causal link to increased mental agility, improved neural pathways and networks, nor did it ever cause an increase of IQ. This is one of those cases where non-scientist media people wrongly interpreted the research (what little there was at the time) and blew it way out of proportion to its potential impact or importance. THEN, marketers jumped in and took advantage of uncritical consumers to foist an entire storehouse of products upon them, allowing or making them think that these products would improve their intelligence, make them work \u201csmarter,\u201d or even raise their babies\u2019 IQ. Hundreds of similar things have happened regarding cancer \u201ccures,\u201d \u201cmiracle magnets,\u201d arthritis treatments (\u201cspecial copper, titanium, favorite metal of the month bracelets), \u201csuperfoods,\u201d \u201cdetox\u201d regimens, and especially nutritional ingredients that have powers to do great things in the human body (apparently there is NOTHING that these nutraceuticals CANNOT do!\u2026sigh!).

            "answer_text": "The book Super Learning by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder looks at research and experiments done by scientists who asked the question \"Can classical music help people learn faster?\"  They found that baroque music increases the capacity for memorization (they focused on languages).  They claim the method allows you to learn anything 2 to 10 times faster, and it isn't instantaneous (and the book was published in 1979) so make of it what you will. Another look at the effect of music (this time Mozart) Does listening to Mozart really boost your brainpower? found that \"unless you and your family have some urgent imaginary origami to do, the chances are that sticking on a sonata is not going to make you better at anything.\"  The studies talked about in the BBC article point to any kind of \"cognitive arousal\" as beneficial in the short term for spacial reasoning exercises. This brain myths article HowStuffWorks \"Top 10 Brain Myths\" says that listening to classical music in no way makes you smarter, but they never said that it isn't good for the brain. If the word \"good\" in the question is interpreted as \"able to make smarter\" than the evidence points to no (the spatial benefits don't even last long enough to take a test).  If \"good\" simply means \"good,\" then I don't see why not.  None of the sources I looked at mentioned any good side effects, but I count happiness from listening to classical music as one.  What does seem to be agreed upon though is that learning to play an instrument (and maybe playing Mozart?) is good for the brain. ",
