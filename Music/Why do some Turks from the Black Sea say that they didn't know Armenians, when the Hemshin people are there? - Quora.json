            "answer_text": "Because they don\u2019t. For one, the Hemshin population of Turkey is effectively confined to the provinces of Rize and Artvin. The two \u2018Black Sea Regions\u2019 according to the NUTS(Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) system are comprised of a total of sixteen provinces including these two. That\u2019s fourteen provinces full of \u2018Turks from Black Sea\u2019 who likely never even saw a Hemshin before. Even in these provinces it isn\u2019t a lot. These two provinces have a population of nearly half a million people, and the Hemshin population of Turkey is just 21.000. That\u2019s four percent of the population in Rize and Artvin: it\u2019s highly likely many of the people there didn\u2019t meet a Hemshin either. Then there is the question: Are Hemshins Armenians? They are of Armenian origin, that is known historical fact, but for centuries they intermingled with Laz and Turkic populations. Over time, they evolved into a distinct culture of their own. A lot of Hemshins do not even acknowledge their Armenian origins, and a good deal of those who do acknowledge it no longer see themselves as Armenian. Some of the remaining who acknowledge themselves as Armenian place little value or emphasis on it: you could know one for years before learning he considers himself an Armenian. The Hemshins are few enough as-is, before adding the criterias of not only considering himself Armenian and placing enough importance on that to make it known to people. That\u2019s how many Hemshins out there? A thousand? That\u2019s why some Turks from Black Sea say they didn\u2019t know Armenians. They don\u2019t. ",

Hamshenians are living in Eastern Black Sea region and even there, they\u2019re not well known due to their dwindling numbers.  Photo by Umut Ka\u00e7ar Also most of Hamshenians, as most of the time very devout Muslims, reject Armenian identity with religious reasons. It\u2019s very common for Eastern Black Sea people who actually talk a local language (Laz, Georgian, Romeika, Hamshenian) define themselves as Kypchak Turks. That\u2019s not true of course. I heard this claim from a very close Hamshenian friend of mine too. I was shocked a little bit of course and even that I tried to prove that the language his grandfather speaks is an Armenian dialect he rejected these and accused me with being a seperatist. As a Turk it was a little bit tragicomic to me, but my countrymen are very famous with their stubbornness and patriotism so\u2026 Eastern Black Sea region is mostly very religious and patriotic. For a great majority of inhabitants, Turk equals to Muslim and Armenian/Greek equals to heathen. Lazs and Georgians are more okay with their ethnicity. ",
