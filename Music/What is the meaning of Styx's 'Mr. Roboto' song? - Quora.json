            "answer_text": "\u201cMr. Roboto\u201d is a song that tells part of the story behind the concept of Styx\u2019s 1983 release \u201cKilroy Was Here\u201d. The story is about a future dystopian society where a tyrannical Dr. Righteous is trying to eradicate rock and roll under the pretense that it corrupts youth by getting them into sex and drugs. Robert Oren Charles Kilroy (the initials spell ROCK) is in prison for allegedly killing a fan at a concert; however, the assault was actually a set up by Dr. Righteous and one of his henchmen. Kilroy is detained in a prison where the guards are \u201cRobotos\u201d, android robots developed in Japan. He would have accepted his fate if it were not for Johnathan Chance, a young rebel who wants to fight against Dr. Righteous and bring back rock. When chance sabotages Righteous\u2019 broadcast channel and gets a video of Kilroy performing on the air, Kilroy hears it and becomes inspired to escape. He attacks his roboto, incapacitates it, and steals its metal face to disguise his own as he escapes from prison. This is all explained in a 9-minute film that accompanied the 1984 video, \u201cCaught in the Act\u201d. The song is sung when Kilroy meets Chance in Righteous\u2019 anti-rock museum. Chance is at first alarmed to see a Roboto approaching him, but then Kilroy removes the mask to reveal his identity. \u201cI\u2019m Kilroy!\u201d ",
