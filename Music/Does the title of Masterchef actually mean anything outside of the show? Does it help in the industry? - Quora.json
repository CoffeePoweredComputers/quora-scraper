The actual title of \u2018master chef\u2019 / \u2018ma\u00eetre de cuisine\u2019 / \u2018K\u00fcchenmeister\u2019 means quite a bit. You need years and years of industry experience to even apply, and then spend considerable time and money on the coursework and exam. The point of the exam is to prove that you are able to organise all aspects of a large-ish pro kitchen and keep it running no matter what. It isn't in demand as much as 20 years ago, but there are still jobs at large, high-prestige establishments that will require it of their head chef. Seriously well-paid, physically somewhat less demanding, but high-responsibility work, if you can get it. Most regular places don't bother. ",
