            "answer_text": "A percentage is paid to the writer or writers of the song. This percentage is a royalty for writing the song. Often the song is owned at least in part by a record company or publishing company. The commission varies from country to country and is a percentage of how many plays it has and in what format. The rate is between around 3% to 9% when someone plays the song live in a venue and a set fee when played on radio. Collections agencies such as PRS and ASCAP collect this money on behalf of the song writer/s and distribute the proceeds. ",
