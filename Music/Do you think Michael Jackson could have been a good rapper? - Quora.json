            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned I think Michael could have been a good rapper had he tried, though I think it wouldn't have quite matched his style. He mostly lets others rappers rap in his songs like \u201cBlack Or White\u201d and \u201cUnbreakable\u201d. However the way he sings on \u201cThey Don\u2019t Care About Us\u201d , and the last verses of \u201cCan\u2019t Let Her Get away\u201d can be counted as rapping. He totally does it in \u201cMoney\u201d and the best example Michael rapping is heard in the technically unreleased track \u201cShout\u201d. This one is a pure rap song going into the hard aggressive style Michael pursued in HIStory. The bad news is that the track is badly mastered. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I actually think he would have. I don\u2019t know about from a lyrical perspective, but from a voice perspective, I think it would\u2019ve been interesting. There are many crucial parts of rap performance that many people ignore in favor of lyricism, and I think he would have been excellent at all of these. Tone of voice, flow, modulation. To me, rap is as much of a vocal art as singing, but more subtle. Many of his songs incorporated instrumental elements extremely similar to many in modern rap. He had an ability to fit his voice to the song that has not been reached since. Michael\u2019s unmatched ability to invoke emotion even with his speaking voice, the wide variety of voices and registers he used, and his incredible sense of rhythm, and separately his ability to use his voice as a rhythm instrument in itself his would have made him quite a good rapper. In many songs he basically did rap, such as \u201cSmooth Criminal\u201d and \u201cThey don\u2019t care about us.\u201d Plus, his hees hees and grunts and whatnot would\u2019ve made for some interesting ad libs. For examples of songs that I think show the aforementioned abilities to use his voice as a dynamic instrument and his sense of rhythm see \u201cDirty Diana\u201d \u201cHuman Nature\u201d \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cPYT\u201d (By the way thank you, I just got back into Michael by way of this question!)

The downside would probably be that he\u2019d actually hit the right notes against the beat that he might end up singing really fast instead. In terms of content, he\u2019d probably be out of place from the rest of rap music, considering his lyrics are either humanity stuff or love stuff. I doubt he\u2019d actually talk about his personal problems, like, I don\u2019t think Billie Jean could\u2019ve been a rap song even if it is actually one of those rap music material topics. ",

He also could beatbox, which makes me believe he could rap if he wanted. ",

He worked with Heavy D on Jam and The Notorious B. I. G. on Unbreakable. He even used one of his music producers, Bill Botrell, to do the rap on the iconic Black or white. I have watched an interview with Michael from 1987 in Japan where he started his Bad tour. The interviewer said that he considered Michael Jackson to be the person to bring rap type dancing \u201cout of the ghettos and into mainstream culture\u201d. But I have never heard Michael give himself credit for that. Geraldo Rivera asked him a similar question to the one your asking around the time Invincible was released and he intimated that it wasn't something he thought he was the best at. So, in conclusion, even though Michael probably had talent in every kind of music-he let the \u201crap experts\u201d do all the heavy lifting. ",
