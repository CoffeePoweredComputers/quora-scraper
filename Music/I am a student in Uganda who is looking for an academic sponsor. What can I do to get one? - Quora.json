If you are below graduate level, there are good Goverment sponsored and funded schools mostly upcountry where you can go and get an education. Otherwise local churches (most commonly evangelical and catholic) like to link people to western sponsors, you could try that. If you are at Gradiuate level, your grades ought to have been in the A\u2019s to get a scholarship, and you sometimes have to work on your eloquence! Starting place is the various spelling mistakes you made in your question (did not mean to hurt you!). ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to advise you that the government of Uganda is the best sponsor. Seek for a scholarship. Private sponsors will in future turn against you because they are doing investment on without your knowledge. You may not know their intentions or motives towards your sponsorship because nobody works for nothing. If you\u2019re a schoolgirl it means automatically you\u2019re looking for a relationship to a rich man and if you\u2019re a schoolboy it seems you\u2019re lazy, you need an able sugar mammy to provide for you. I have read your mind and please stop those poor intentions, make good use of quora. Sponsors are dangerous because they pay themselves back at any time they feel like. Take care and don\u2019t shame yourself, parents, and the government of Uganda. ",
