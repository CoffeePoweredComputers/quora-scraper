            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only been in the UK for 5 years, so I\u2019m certainly no expert but I do have a few thoughts on the matter. The UK is a bit more nostalgic than the US. In my local area alone there are about 4\u20135 Blues Brothers tribute singers and maybe as many Freddy Mercury impersonators. Second, British singers normally mimic American accents when they\u2019re singing. But, there\u2019s a tendency to be missing that magical ingredient in their music. I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s like comparing British food to American food. It will fill you up but it ain\u2019t spectacular. This may sound like an exaggeration, but even McDonalds here tastes bland. There\u2019s something in this culture that\u2019s ok with being bland and unexciting. Third, American art forms have been copied for a long time. And even in America Black art forms have been stolen and mimicked like Blues, Jazz, Gospel, Rock & Roll, R&B, etc. and the offenders have Pat Booned all of the soul out of the music until all of what made it so special was sucked out of it. In my opinion, Brits may be able to hit the notes, but miss out on the essence of the music. Fourth, my garage is next to my neighbors garage and he plays an oldies station all day every day. Some days I dread working in my garage, because if I have to hear another Beatles song again I might just take a baseball bat to that innocent radio of his. Some people can listen to the same 3 songs for decades like it\u2019s the first time they heard it. There are a lot of older Brits that do not value creativity in music like I\u2019m used to in America. Finally, I\u2019m thankful for internet radio, because the music that\u2019s played on the radio here can be quite depressing. There are few artists here that don\u2019t sound like the artist that preceded them on the radio. It may be because I\u2019m getting older, but I wind up turning off the radio and just watch the scenery pass by. That\u2019s just how uninspiring the music here is to me and I think the aforementioned observations are contributing factors as to why a lot of Americans aren\u2019t inspired by a lot of acts from the UK.

            "answer_text": "I am not sure it is. OK, I listen to a particular genre of music, Alternative/Rock, and only listen to the radio station in my home town of San Diego, but probably 20% of the music on the 4 stations I listen to are British. Right now, I just went to the website of my local station 91X, and here are the last 7 songs played (not sure why they picked 7 to show not 10!) From : 91X - Song History JUST A GIRL No DoubtTHOUGHT CONTAGION MuseSEVEN NATION ARMY The White StripesDARE GorillazFIRST DATE BLINK 182SUPERPOSITION Young The GiantSUGAR, WE'RE GOIN DOWN FALL OUT BOYIf that is anything to go from, 2 out of 7 (29%) of the songs were British. From the other station I listen to from the last 28 songs, 5 (18%) were British (and 20 American) Still Breathing Green_DayNorthern Lights Death Cab For CutieSeven Nation Army White StripesSober Up AJRShut Up And Dance - Walk The MoonWish I Knew You The RevivalistsGuiding Light Mumford & SonsSanteria SUBLIMEThought Contagion MuseMountain Sound Of_Monsters_And_Men (Iceland!)Chlorine Twenty One PilotsSail AWOLnationSomething Just Like This Chainsmokers_&_ColdplayWelcome To Paradise Green DayWe Are Young fun_feat._Janelle_MonaeBroken LovelythebandHigh Hopes Panic!

BastilleLoser BECKThere is the local rock station, with only 1 out of 10 (only 10%) songs this morning being British (unless you count the British singer in AC/DC, but I\u2019ll let Australia have them) Tell Me Baby Red Hot Chili PeppersBodies - Drowning PoolZombie - Bad WolvesRock and Roll - Led ZeppelinBeverly Hills - WeezerAin't No Rest for the Wicked - Cage the ElephantHow Did You Love - ShinedownT.N.T. - AC/DC (British singer!)She - Green DayInsane in the Brain - Cypress HillNow to contrast, I did the same thing for my old favorite Alt station in the UK, Radio X, here is there evening playlist. 8 out of 10 are British, and one Canadian and on Dutch, not an American song in sight!

Of course, if you like 90\u2019s skate punk, then the US wins hands down! ",
