If that\u2019s the case, we should admit we watch them for entertainment rather than their life-changing abilities. We simply don\u2019t need to be intensely motivated for everything. It\u2019s fine to just go for a run or write some words without becoming your own personal cheerleader in the process. It\u2019s called being normal. Consistent progress will beat motivational videos every time. That\u2019s what self-discipline grants us. ",

But it depends on you that either you tune to your track work hard and get the shit to be done instead of sitting and ignoring the message given from the motivational videos. Motivational videos are the macroboosters which just help you to push yourself extra while they are very important as we are able to learn many things from someone else experiences as life is short to practice those experiences yourself so just try to learn from others by watching such motivational videos.
