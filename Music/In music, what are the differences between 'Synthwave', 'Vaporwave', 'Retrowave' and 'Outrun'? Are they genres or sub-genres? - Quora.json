            "answer_text": "Vaporwave - First Step; slowing, chopping, changing and remixing older tracks, normally to distort the message the original artist set. It can be a whole mix of reasons or messages. Synthwave - More like a more rhythmic vaporwave, set in the aesthetic of those old Rider videos of the 80\u2019s with TRON like backgrounds and terrains. Outrun - Rhythmic, partially ghostly tracks more like Fast and the Furious, but they border on Synthwave. Future Funk - Stacked, sometimes sped up tracks with more Japanese, high pitched vocals that evoke more of a \u2018 make music to make music \u2018 part of Vaporwave. Certainly a more \u201cbrain off\u201d enjoyment of vaporwave. Witch House - Taking the aesthetic of Paganism/Satanism and the music of Vaporwave and turning it into a super dark house with some of the darker parts of the original track to make it sound, well, Satanic. Retrowave - Aesthetic of vaporwave, but taking the aspects of synths like square waves, old 8-bit styles or recordings, and chopping them up to make a completely different song. The only way to find samples from retrowave is rhythm alone. Honestly, Sludge, Witch House, and anything with Funk are my favorites. ",

            "answer_text": "You decide. People obsess about categories, when really there\u2019s no such thing. There\u2019s just music, and certain works of music that people call definitive of a genre. But you can have arbitrarily many of those, and if what you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t definitive in many people\u2019s opinion, well, it has features of this, and features of that, and features of that other thing over there. You don\u2019t need the categories to enjoy it. And while you need some so you can find it to buy, you don\u2019t want them to be too fine, or they start being counterproductive. ",
