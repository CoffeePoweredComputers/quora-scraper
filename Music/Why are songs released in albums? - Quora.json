            "answer_text": "The album as we have come to know it is actually only a very recent phenomena; only since magnetic tapes and vinyl have we actually had this notion of a series of songs or pieces that are meant to be played in a certain order. So if we want to ask the question as to why the album became such a dominant musician's tool for selling music, as opposed to individual songs, we must first go into the history of music, back to the classical composers. Beethoven and Mozart, for two quick examples, much preferred the grandiose longer pieces, as opposed to short, bite-sized chunks. Their symphonies were divided up, not into songs (as they were not sung), but movements. A movement, imagine, as a sub-section of a symphony, which should technically be able to stand on its own, though is generally played in a certain order. An hour-long symphony, for example, might be split up into 6 separate movements, each ten minutes long. The idea of their symphonies and operas were generally to tell a story. In the same way that you would prefer to read stories in a novel as opposed to 1500 words, as the situations, context, and characters can be built up better (generally) the longer it is (up to a point). As a result, most major symphonies lasted between 30 minutes and 4 hours. If we continue music tradition along, and we have the technology to store music, the people who created albums did not necessarily want to release a single song, because one song generally encompasses one idea or one concept, as opposed to an album, which can cover vastly more areas than a single song. If we use a book metaphor again, we can consider each song from an album as a chapter in a novel. While you can generally read a chapter by itself and enjoy it thoroughly, one generally reads the preceding chapters beforehand, so they can understand the context and movement of the narrative. However, there are opposing thoughts on current music. General radio stations play a single song from an artist before moving onto a single song from another artist, as the songs are generally engineered to be listened to in bite-sized chunks, as to not overwhelm the listener. This is not necessarily a new thing, but is being focused on more and more. As a result, many listeners find the idea of an album old, outdated, and unessential to current listening trends. On the other hand, many listeners (myself included) consider music the opposite; a single song simply does not tell a story, nor provide the band's context in the same way that an album possibly can. For some other trivia, the very reason that the CD can store 74 minutes of music is because Sony vice-president Norio Ohga wanted to listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on a single disc. And it was so. ",

            "answer_text": "A good album is more than the sum of its parts. That is, the songs and their sequence reinforce or contrast one another's sound and meaning, relating to one another to build a more complex whole.  This is was reinforced by the popularity of the LP. In the age of the vinyl, a good album often had significant differences between its A and B sides. Do yourself a favor, and turn off your music player's shuffle mode or put on a record or CD and listen to some albums that are great as albums, and not just as a collection of songs:  If your tastes are anything close to mine, try The Beatles's Abbey Road, The Who's Tommy, David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust or Low, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Animals, Genesis's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Brian Eno's Before and After Science, Depeche Mode's Songs of Faith and Devotion, Sufjan Steven's Illinoise, Arcade Fire's Funeral, Neko Case's Middle Cyclone (or many, many others) ",
