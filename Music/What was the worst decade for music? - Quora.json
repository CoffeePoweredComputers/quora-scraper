            "answer_text": "I would say the 2000\u2019s but there\u2019s still a ton of good music out there. The 2000\u2019s are the end result of the music industry becoming more regional and culturally specific. You have to find things you like and I\u2019m ok with that. Labels are more diverse and bands are taking matters into their own hands. Truly the worst was the 80\u2019s. The 80\u2019s was the decade of pure corporate rock. Most of the good bands/musicians were marginalized and their music was harvested and ripped off to be used by bands that were custom built by record labels that took all the meaning out of it. A perfect example would be the endless parade of Prince look a likes that existed during the 80\u2019s. Every single light skinned African American male had the same Prince inspired haircut. They all had that androgynous manner. They all thought they were geniuses. And they were all terrible. Babyface had the haircut. If you do a search for \u2018The World Class Wrecking Crew\u2019 you\u2019ll see that the group that wound up being N.W.A. had the haircut. Then there\u2019s the Police. I can\u2019t even fathom the idea of taking three white guys, paying them to bleach their hair and making them a ska/reggae band at that period in punk. I\u2019ll admit that I did like some of their songs slightly, but really? They were just a vague attempt at attracting the audience that was listening to the English Beat and the Specials over to a major record label (and the English Beat brilliantly responded by going full on calypso), but they looked like a Neo-Nazi/White Supremacist wet dream. What was \u2018Walking On The Moon\u2019 about anyway? Seriously, it\u2019s a song that tries to be deep while actually being about nothing. But they are true lightweights in being bad when compared to Men At Work, the Motels, Haircut 100, Rick Astley, the Sparks. That whole corporate attempt at watering punk down and rebranding it as \u2018New Wave\u2019 was just an absolute failure. And they made movies to promote it no less. I mean PHIL COLLINS! hthe hell was that all about? The guy was the drummer for Genesis, then all of a sudden he\u2019s an old, balding superstar. I remember him singing \u2018You Can\u2019t Hurry Love\u2019 dressed like John Belushi in the Blues Brothers. REALLY? Then, finally, it all fell apart when the real deal broke through. Bands like Fishbone, Nirvana and the Red Hot Chili Peppers cleaned our palates. Finally somebody wrote something real again. Thank God. ",

            "answer_text": "The 2000s. And I\u2019m only considering decades within the history of recorded music. The 2000s has a number of bad trends. We still had the record companies pushing grunge immitators like Creed and Nickelback. Metal finally made a comeback, but in the worst way possible with nu-metal. The \u201890s innovations in hip-hop became a mire of Autotuned pop nonsense. Not to mention the Loudness War and the major labels doing their best to kill digital distribution. There is also nothing really defining about any part of that decade music-wise. Some good individual artists stand out, but for the most part there is no defining sound of the time, save Autotune and overused rap interludes. ",
