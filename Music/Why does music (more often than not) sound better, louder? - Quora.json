            "answer_text": "The main reason is sensitivity based on loudness. The human ear generally hears the clearest at 88 db (measure of \u201cloudness\u201d.) What do I mean by clearest? at lower levels of sound, certain frequencies and harmonics will be too low for your ear to pick up and interpret correctly within the mix of sounds and as such you will be MISSING some sounds. At higher levels your ears actually distort and hear additional sound that is not there. This can actually be beneficial because it gives the illusion that the music is fuller than it actually is. This fullness can contribute to the energy experienced with louder music. Another interesting aspect is that your ear hears different frequencies at different volumes even when they are being played objectively at the same volume (this has been charted in the fletcher munschen equal loudness curves. You can see that the curve flattens out at higher SPL.)So you experience a sound as louder or quieter than it actually is depending on what frequency the sound is. Generally humans hear mid frequencies between 2\u20135Khz as louder than other frequencies at the same actual volume. Interestingly range is where the human voice and babies crying generally reside, so there is some indication that either the human ear evolved to be more sensitive to communication with others from our species, OR our voices evolved to better make use of the natural sensitivities that the human ear has. This frequency disparity changes at higher volumes which also can lead to music sounding fuller than it is because we are perceiving certain frequencies as louder than they generally are, and others as quieter. This is legitimately altering the perception of the original mix that was created by the band producer/mastering tech etc. You may just enjoy this different \u201cmix\u201d better than the one created at normal listening levels. Science aside, to succinctly answer your question, you literally hear music differently at louder volumes. It is not the same song when listening at regular volumes. You hear things that arent there, and you hear aspects of the song as louder and quieter then they were intended to be in relation to each other. Its not an illusion, its actually different. Cheers, Adrian Quick edit re: Lloyd Christmas answer and vinyl. The way that vinyl is played back (via a needle) and also often through other analogue equipment, introduces distortion. Luckily that distortion happens to be in the form of even order harmonics which are perceived by us as \u201cwarm\u201d so the distortion is pleasant. Vinyl and analog playback also suffer from other limiting effects which can cut out transient harmonic spikes etc. So basically vinyl and analog recording and playback is objectively less accurate in real world scenarios, but the WAY that the sound changes is actually pleasant for many people. Again, its not in peoples heads (although some people are way too religious about the idea and I would suggest many avid \u201clisteners\u201d couldnt blind test analog vs digital) the sound itself IS different.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have a particularly scientific answer to this, so experience will have to do. I am a member of a symphony orchestra (100 members or so) so, as you can imagine, I\u2019m quite close to all the noise. I\u2019ve also attended a few concerts, sitting at the front and back of the hall and taken notice of the drastic difference in my perception of sound. One of the main problems with sitting very far away or having the volume too low is the loss of detail. You only get the notes, but little to no sounds, which are surprisingly important. Imagine a big timpani drum, for example. If you sit very far away you\u2019ll get a slightly flabby note (tone), while sitting closer up will allow you to hear the sound of the drumstick hitting the skin of the drum, the vibrations, etc. Another example: playing an instrument. Since my violin is always right next to my ear, no noise escapes. I hear the slightest scratch of the bow setting the strings into motion, the impact of my fingers hitting the fingerboard, etc. The audience, however has a totally different experience. What they hear is a much sweeter tone and sound scape (It\u2019s actually more enjoyable at times). But once again, sitting at the back of a large hall will result in much the same experience I described previously. Imagine: the sound, from its initial production, has travelled over 50 metres to get to your ears. You think you\u2019re going to hear all those nice details you would hear at the front of the audience or within the orchestra? No, of course not! The volume of music (when played back on speakers, etc) has a very similar effect. You\u2019ll hear the notes, the melody and so on but will have more trouble picking up what else is going on - be it the instrument\u2019s acoustics, different instruments, whatever. In general, the closer the volume is to the true volume of the instrument(s) being played, the better the detail and the better your listening experience. Well, that\u2019s my answer. Hope it helps :) ",
