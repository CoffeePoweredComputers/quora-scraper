            "answer_text": "It\u2019s extremely modern big band jazz of the sort you hear in such Japanese anime as Cowboy Bebop. But it\u2019s big band jazz with something quite singular besides, a good deal of theater added. a good deal of exaggeration. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the same person who composed the music to Cowboy Bebop composed this as well. It seems to have his stamp upon it. But it does seem to me to represent a quite singular approach to the big band sound. More accurate than calling it a \u201cstyle,\u201d perhaps, would be to call it a style setter, swinging and exciting. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say this is a bit jazzy. The instrumentation sounds like a bit like a stripped back big band vamping over one chord. The drum beat is reminiscent of Benny Goodman\u2019s Sing Sing Sing, but at a faster tempo. Other might or might not agree, but I\u2019m getting a Charles Mingus vibe from it. The tempo is fast enough that eighth notes tend to be straighter, rather than \u201cswung\u201d, but there is some syncopation there that I would argue most rock tunes don\u2019t have. ",
