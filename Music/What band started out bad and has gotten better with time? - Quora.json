            "answer_text": "Goo Goo Dolls Their first records were punk based. Rob Takac wrote a lot of the songs, and was the lead singer in the band. They sounded like this  But then on the 3rd record, John Rzeznik emerged writing songs and started singing some of the songs. They released their first single, There You Are and made their first video, but still didn\u2019t get any attention. But their 5th record, their fortune was changing. The release A Boy Named Goo featured their first bonafide hit, Name. The song featured their signature sound that all their new fans would recognize to this day.  But everything changed forever for them with their next release, and 6th, yes 6th album. This would really never happen today, and it\u2019s actually quite remarkable that labels would stick with a band this long. Dizzy Up The Girl would be that life changing release and featured Iris. This song was released in 1998, nearly 10 years after their first punk release. It is the MOST PLAYED SONG on the radio since 1998. No song has been played that many times. Everyone knows this song. The irony was this album the pressure was enormous on John, they had finally achieved the start of success with Name, but now he had to keep it going. This pressure cause him to have writers block, and he was stuck. I saw an interview with him, that he was so worried that he wondered if he could ever write another song. But then the Goo Goo Dolls and Alanis Morrissette were asked to write a song for the movie City Of Angels, the Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage movie. Alanis submitted the song Uninvited and John submitted Iris. The rest is history.  If you are a fan of the Goo Goo Dolls and the song Iris, check out this video by Tim Pierce. Tim is a famous guitar player, and he played the haunting slide guitar and the mandolin. He tells the story along with the producer Rob Cavallo, and they play the original demo.  The Goo Goo Dolls are the champs of bad to great, in almost 10 years of trying. ",

They may not everybody\u2019s cup of tea but there are some good bits on \u201cDemons and Wizards\u201d and \u201cThe Magicians Birthday\u201d and sold a few records over the years. Apparently the band, okay only with one of the original members, still tours eastern Europe on the arena circuit, over 50 years after the first album release. I think I am safe in saying that \u201cUriah Heep\u201d did improve a hell over of a lot over a short period of time. ",
