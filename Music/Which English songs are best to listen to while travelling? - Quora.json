            "answer_text": "Travel with words, meet the world. Here\u2019s the playlist to listen while travelling - 1. Fast car -It is about change and wanting to escape. Road trips tend to do that, don\u2019t they?  \u201cYou got a fast carIs it fast enough so we can fly away?We gotta make a decisionLeave tonight or live and die this way So remember when we were driving driving in your carSpeed so fast I felt like I was drunkCity lights lay out before usAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulderAnd I had a feeling that I belongedI had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\u201d 2. Life is a highway -  \u201cLife is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long / If you\u2019re going my way, I wanna drive it all night long.\u201d That\u2019s how the song begins. You gonna love the song, one of my favorite. 3. Paradise -  \u201cWhen she was just a girlShe expected the worldBut it flew away from her reachAnd the bullets catch in her teethLife goes on, it gets so heavyThe wheel breaks the butterflyEvery tear a waterfallIn the night the stormy night she'll close her eyesIn the night the stormy night away she'd fly\u201d 4. Home -  \u201cSettle down, it'll all be clearDon't pay no mind to the demonsThey fill you with fearThe trouble\u2014it might drag you downIf you get lost, you can always be found Just know you're not alone'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home\u201d 5. Lucy in the sky with diamonds -  Picture yourself in a boat on a riverWith tangerine trees and marmalade skiesSomebody calls you, you answer quite slowlyA girl with kaleidoscope eyes 6. Hotel California -  \"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell\"Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the wayThere were voices down the corridor,I thought I heard them say... 7. Wanted dead or alive -  I walk these streetsA loaded six-string on my backI play for keeps 'cause I might not make it backI been everywhere, still, I'm standing tallI've seen a million facesAnd I've rocked them all 8. All summer long -  Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to changeOr how we thought those days would never endSometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing alongAnd think man I'd love to see that girl again 9. Boulevard of broken dreams -  \u201cI walk a lonely roadThe only one that I have ever knownDon't know where it goesBut it's home to me and I walk alone\u201d \u201cMy shadow's the only one that walks beside meMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beatingSometimes I wish someone out there will find me'Til then I walk alone.\u201d 10. The Nights -  \u201cHe said, \"One day you'll leave this world behindSo live a life you will remember.\"My father told me when I was just a childThese are the nights that never die\u201d \u201cWhen thunder clouds start pouring downLight a fire they can't put outCarve your name into those shining starsHe said, \"Go venture far beyond these shores.Don't forsake this life of yours.I'll guide you home no matter where you are.\" If you like my music recommendations, follow me on my blog \u201cMusic Devotee\u201d.

Hello?Is there anybody in there?Just nod if you can hear meIs there anyone at home?Come on nowI hear you\u2019re feeling downWell I can ease your painGet you on your feet againRelaxI\u2019ll need some information firstJust the basic factsCan you show me where it hurts?There is no pain you are recedingA distant ship smoke on the horizonYou are only coming through in wavesYour lips move but I can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re sayingWhen I was a child I had a feverMy hands felt just like two balloonsNow I\u2019ve got that feeling once againI can\u2019t explain you would not understandThis is not how I amI have become comfortably numbOkayJust a little pinprickThere\u2019ll be no more, ahBut you may feel a little sickCan you stand up?I do believe it\u2019s working, goodThat\u2019ll keep you going through the showCome on it\u2019s time to goThere is no pain you are recedingA distant ship, smoke on the horizonYou are only coming through in wavesYour lips move but I can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re sayingWhen I was a childI caught a fleeting glimpseOut of the corner of my eyeI turned to look but it was goneI cannot put my finger on it nowThe child is grownThe dream is goneI have become comfortably numb ",

The first time I listened to this song was on a December morning at like 6 o\u2019 clock , I was in Nargol (Gujrat). As I recall it was the last day of a meditation camp, the realization that it's time say good bye to a loved one & time to go back home struck me. As I listen to this song it takes me back to that time, the chilled winds and waves of sea, the silence & the noice of the trees, everything. I don't know if it's about the lyrics or the music of this song but whenever I listen to this song while travelling it reminds me to let go, to be in each passing moment, a witness, a watcher. This is the photo I clicked that morning. I could attach a video but there's no option.  ",
