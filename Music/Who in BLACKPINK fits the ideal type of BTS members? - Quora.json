            "answer_text": "V // KIM TAEHYUNG :  At the first point, Jennie was perfect until it got to the second ideal. Jennie and Lisa are known to care less about saving money in the group. All the members seem like family women but I\u2019d say RM // KIM NAMJOON :  All of the members are actually very intelligent in their own ways. In my opinion, I think Namjoon would be attracted to Lisa\u2019s style of voice and she\u2019s arguably the sexiest member. Lisa is almost perfect but she\u2019s not very feminine, she\u2019s in between tomboyish and ladylike. So I\u2019d go with Ros\u00e9, the tallest who has a sexy side, a nice voice, and more feminine. PARK JIMIN :  Jimin is actually very self conscious of his height so unfortunately Lisa and Ros\u00e9 are crossed out. Unfortunately in another article, Jimin has stated that he doesn\u2019t like a shy girl (Jennie has some sort of awkwardness to her). So Jisoo is the closest. SUGA // MIN YOONGI :  Lisa : likes hip hop/rap. Ros\u00e9 : the calmest in BLACKPINK. Jennie : somewhat similar. Jisoo : she thinks out the box and loves books. I am not sure which member wins as his ideal type as they all fit one thing but clash with the others. He doesn\u2019t really care about appearance, though. I\u2019d pick Ros\u00e9 as she was studying to be a lawyer. JIN // KIM SEOKJIN :  I immediately thought of Jisoo and Jennie. They both can cook well and seem like they can care for Seokjin. JHOPE // JUNG HOSEOK :  Jisoo loves books and taking care of her members. She\u2019s also very supportive and decent at cooking. JUNGKOOK // JEON JEUNGGUK :  Lisa perfectly fits this whole entire list (she\u2019s the long legs queen, competitive, has godly proportions) but entirely fails at being able to cook \ud83d\ude02  RM : LISA, ROS\u00c9, JENNIE JIN : JENNIE, JISOO HOBI : JENNIE, JISOO SUGA : JISOO JIMIN : JISOO V : JENNIE, JISOO JK : ROS\u00c9  J-hope : Jisoo, Ros\u00e9 SUGA : Lisa, Jennie, Ros\u00e9, Jisoo Jin : Lisa, Jisoo JUNGKOOK : Lisa, Jennie, Ros\u00e9 V : Ros\u00e9, Jennie Jimin : Jisoo, Ros\u00e9 RM : Jisoo, Jennie I\u2019ll reupdate with my overall ranking and better descriptions soon!

            "answer_text": "RM-  His ideal type fits all of the girls really well. He said he would like it if his ideal type would wear feminine clothes and they all dress quite feminine apart from Lisa who sometimes dresses well not feminine. Jisoo likes to read a lot and that\u2019s a trait that RM likes. Other than that everyone else fits quite well into his standards, but mostly Jisoo Jin-  Lisa and Ros\u00e8 are a bit too tall for his standards. Jisoo and Lisa likes to joke around and that is what Jin likes, so does Jennie and Ros\u00e8 but they don\u2019t really as often. He finds it incredible when foreigners speak korean which is a point to Lisa but also a point to Ros\u00e8 since she grew up in Australia and mostly spoke English.Speaking Korean on a daily basis was quite new for her. Jin would like a pale girl but the blackpink members all have days when they\u2019re pale and when they\u2019re tan. Jennie wants someone to protect her and Jin wants to look after his significant other. Both Jennie and Jisoo fit well in Jin\u2019s standards Suga-  Jennie weighs 3kg more than his preference(nothing wrong with her weight). Ros\u00e8 has the most passion for music in general. Most of the information was kinda hard to differentiate since I can see all members fitting into it but so far Ros\u00e8 fits the most into his standards. Jhope-  Jhope would want to try and date a foreigner so that\u2019s a point to Lisa and a point to Ros\u00e8 as I said before, she grew up in Australia. Lisa and Ros\u00e8 are a bit too tall for his standards. Jisoo loves reading books which is a point for her. He likes aegyo which all the girls sometimes show when needed. Jisoo mostly fits into his standards Jimin-  He wants someone smaller than him. All the members of blackpink are smaller than him. He likes doll eyes which Lisa has. Differentiating the information in his video to each member was also very difficult as I can also see all members fitting into his standards. V-  Ros\u00e8 and Lisa are a bit too tall for V\u2019s standards. Jisoo likes to play video games and phone games which V also likes. Like I said for other members, it was hard to differentiate the information in his video between the members of blackpink. So far Jisoo fits well in his standards the most. Jungkook-  Jungkook likes younger girls but blackpink are older than him. He would like it if his significant other gives off mature \u201cnoona\u201d vibes. Jennie weighs a little bit too much for Jungkook but as I said before she is perfectly healthy. He likes it when a girl plays video games and jisoo also likes video games. Like a said before, I couldn\u2019t tell who exactly I\u2019m blackpink fit into his standards. But jisoo fits the most. ",
