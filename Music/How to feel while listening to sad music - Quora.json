            "answer_text": "When I am feeling sad I will usually listen to what I consider to be ballads of sadness, loneliness, sorrow,etc. A reasonable person would think that by doing so, I would become so depressed and make things seem even worse than they are. Listening to the lyrics or feeling the emotions that the music portrays actually makes me feel like I am not so alone in my sad place, that someone else has been in my situation and gotten through it the best way they can, in their case, musically. So the sad music lets the musicians release their emotions and also helps the listener feel like there is always hope and they are not alone. Believe me, it helps. ",
