            "answer_text": "I am an acoustic player. Electric guys may find more or different reasons. I use a drop-D most often when I am playing in D, and the tune wants a very strong bass, sometimes almost a drone. If we have an actual bass to get that note, I will perhaps skip the drop D. The D chord shape in standard tuning does not have a lot of bottom. It is not like a C, or an A, or G, and certainly not like an E. All of these have a tonic note on the lowest string, or right next to it. Even C, where the tonic is the highest of that bunch, has a G available on the lowest string, and that is almost as good. But for a D, the lowest tonic is on still another string up. It is a good sound, but not particularly rich. You can get some help by bringing your thumb over the top of the neck to play an F# on your low string, but it just sounds a little thin sometimes. Tuning that Low E string down to a D let's you get some seriously rich bottom to that otherwise bright D chord. If that is something the tune wants, it can be a very good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Drop tuning to a D open 6th string is very useful way to expand your performance options. There are some compositions that sound great with a D 6th string. You can get a sitar effect by playing with a D tuned guitar. I have worked out a few versions of my favorite tunes using the dropped D. Black Mountainside from the Led Zeppelin I, is fun to experiment with. I also have a D tuning version of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Third Stone From The Sun. If D tuning is required, it might seem like work. If D tuning is added to your bag of music magic you get inspired to create sounds. Just think like a melody. The drone feature lets you sound like a Raga. You can add an East Indian flavor to your wanderings. If you wander enough you will create your own tunes with the experience you have added with your D tuning adventures. Long story short, if the composition needs some thing different than a standard E 6th tuning, the D tuning can be a good option. It provides depth and resonance to the performance. There are many ways to tune a guitar to accommodate various situations and the D tuning is one of the easiest. Interesting question. One thing to keep in mind is to remember to re-tune your guitar to standard. It is maddening to pick up guitar in the morning and hear the unexpected. (Even if it ends up sounding great!) Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Standard tuning has E as its lowest pitch and drop-D tuning gives two more notes below E: Eb/D# and D. So you should use drop-D tuning when you need those two notes because you can\u2019t play them in standard tuning. There are a few effects of drop-D to note: The lowest D in standard tuning is the same pitch as the open D string (4th) string, or the D on the 5th fret 5th string or 10th fret 6th string. Tuning the 6th string down to D allows you to play a D an octave lower which can help to fill out the sound of an open D chord or any chord with a low D in it.The open low D is now useful as a low drone to play against in one of the keys or modes based on D.With D as an open string you get harmonics related to D at the 12th, 7th and 5th fret etc. instead of harmonics related to E.All the notes on the 6th string move up a whole step from where they were previously in standard tuning and match your notes on the open 4th string. Power chords that previously required two fingers on different frets are now on the same fret and can be played with one finger.Like any change in tuning certain chords/fingerings may become easier while others may become harder.",

            "answer_text": "Anytime a song is written in D, D minor, or even B minor and F (the relative minor of D major and relative major of D minor, respectively) I think it\u2019s worth considering drop D tuning. The reasoning behind that is a guitar playing in D using standard tuning is a lot like it playing in D on a piano that ends just one white key short of the bass note that your key is tonally centered around. There is a good chance that at some point you\u2019ll find your ears are wanting to try and go to play that missing key. And on the guitar, adjusting the tuning to add that note also happens to leave many patterns that are convenient for the shape of our hands intact. In classical guitar, drop D and several other tunings are used generally because whatever piece they are playing was originally composed on a piano and they don\u2019t really give a fk if it\u2019s hard to play on other instruments.

I really can\u2019t add much more to this than the given answers so be sure to read them. For me, the sound is a bit \u201cheavier\u201d when playing in Drop-D and it offers a different approach to \u201criffing.\u201d You just have to play both ways (standard tuning, drop-D tuning) to appreciate the differences. Now: if you have a guitar with a FLOATING TREMOLO (Floyd Rose, typically; there are others!) then you\u2019ll encounter tuning issues along the way. There is a Floyd Rose add-on called a \u201cD-Tuna\u201d (licensed for Edward Van Halen\u201d by Floyd Rose Upgrades that can let you flip quickly between standard tuning and drop-D tuning but do beware that the overall tuning of the guitar shifts slightly. So your playing will have to compensate. In most cases the shift is subtle enough to work - just giving you forewarning. But\u2026 Having said all of this, it all goes back to what the song needs. Gotta get a progression to go down to the key of D and you don\u2019t want to lose the low end feel? Drop-D may just be what you need\u2026 Hope this helps! ",

When\u2026 The song is in the key of D.You want a fatter sound, something with more bass from your guitar.You're finger picking and you want to \"pedal\" off the root low D note. Especially if yours is the only guitar playing. (Check out Stephen Stills using Drop D on both E strings on the CS&N song \"You Don't Have to Cry\" on YouTube)All of those tips are intended to give an acoustic guitar a broader, fatter sound than standard tuning provides. Experiment with different tunings to get the most out of your guitar's sound. I keep a guitar tuned in DADG#AD to keep my options open and because it's a great key for acoustic slide guitar. My lap steel is tuned to C6. Just strumming an alternate tuning can inspire a new song in your head. See what you discover when you try it! ",

            "answer_text": "In classical guitar its pretty easy. If you\u2019re playing a piece WRITTEN in drop D, using it makes sense. Most classical example would be \u201cCapricho Arabe\u201d by Francisco Tarrega. That was written in 1892, by the way. . .drop D is NOT a \u201cnew tuning\u201d. But there are a bunch of other well-known classical pieces in drop D, including the allegro movement of the Concerto de Aranjuez by Joaquin Rodrigo. Here\u2019s Marcin Dylla playing it with a spectacular young orchestra CORda Cracovia:  Edit: I kind of gave a cursory answer there. More comprehensive answer for non classical playing is that drop D does two important things for you: -Extends the bass range of the instrument by one whole tone, and, perhaps more importantly, gives you a low D. Low open D string makes playing in the key of D easier. Since D is often a friendly key for male vocalists, this particular tuning can be really helpful in a band context. -By having the 6th and 4th strings tuned to the same note, you can do one finger 1\u20135\u20131 \u201cpower chords\u201d on the low three strings. This can be really conducive to rock/metal guitar rhythm playing, and its another reason why this tuning is used relatively commonly in rock guitar. ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, it allows you to play riff-style parts as chords instead of single note lines. A typical G power chord would be notated as: x\u00a0x\u00a0x\u00a05\u00a05\u00a03\u00a0Playing that same G power chord on Drop D tuning would look like this: x\u00a0x\u00a0x\u00a05\u00a05\u00a05\u00a0Notice, it can all be played with one finger? That allows for taking what would otherwise be a single note line, and chunking it up into thick, meaty power chords. That\u2019s the primary reason. Some bands tune that way permanently (Avenged Sevenfold, Trivium, most metalcore) and other bands may use it only occasionally, while some don\u2019t use it at all. ",
