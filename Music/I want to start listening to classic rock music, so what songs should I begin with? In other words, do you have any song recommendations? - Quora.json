            "answer_text": "This is much more complicated than you think. Classic Rock is not all the same, like any other genre it has levels. Some people/radio stations believe that Classic Rock encompasses songs of a certain age. It's how Bon Jovi got to be considered classic rock. The big guns of classic rock are as follows Chuck Berry The Beatles The Rolling Stones (before 1980) The Who. For these guys, start with the big hits and work your way in. Led Zeppelin is also a landmark band but you need to cherry pick the songs. I'd start with Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and then Stairway to Heaven. The Band Queen is often over played and over hyped but check out Under Pressure, Killer Queen, and Hammer to Fall I'd mention the early works of David Bowie, but it seems obvious. Check out Changes, Sufragette City, Rebel Rebel, Sound and Vision, and Golden Years. Some of the best Classic Rock songs are by lesser known bands or bands that are often overlooked. Black Betty by Ram Jam Radar Love by Golden Earring Aqualung by Jethro Tull White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane Lola by The Kinks Running on Empty by Jackson Brown Night Moves by Bob Seger Foreplay/long time by Boston (there whole first album is awesome) White Room by Cream Stuck in the Middle by Stealers Wheel I have more, but half the fun is hunting around finding the good stuff. If you want more we can talk. I could even break stuff down by decade. Oh yeah\u2026BTW the greatest American Classic Rock band (IMHO) is Creedence Clearwater Revival ",
