            "answer_text": "Most of the Midi Keyboards come with free software. Even if you buy a cheaper interface - like Solo by Focusrite - you get Ableton lite and Pro tools live. You can also use your PC keyboard and get a free DAW like Cakewalk GarageBand Ardour Rosegarden LMMS and Qtractor etc. I believe even the entry level Akai25 and Novation25s have free software but verify it first on their websites.
