            "answer_text": "What is your real motivation to want to make music? Is it to feel like you have some connection to this artist? If this artists retired to.orrow amd took up acting never to write music again, would you continue to write and record music? Alot of outsiders (general public who don't write music or play an instrument professionally) think that if you aren't going to be world famous then what's the point of having anything to do with music rather than listen to it? I find this strange considering all the other professions / arts that accept people do it purely for the love of it. I can't see why you would want to write songs if you dont habe an absolute buring desire to do so? It sounds to me like you have an outside influence or motivating factor besides your heart? We Al question oursleves from time to time but if you are wondering why you are doing something more than just doing it may be you would be better to idolize your muse rather than try and keep up with him. Ask yourself what you really WANT to do as a hobby. I may be wrong but it sounds alot like the situation which happens alot where a child is pushed by their parents to live the parents dream rather than the child's. Maybe you are being pushed by an inner voice wanting to please your idol rather than you? ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI don\u2019t love music as much as my favorite artist\u201d is a subjective statement. No doubt there are people that make music because they have a knack for it but perhaps not \u201clove it\u201d like others do who can\u2019t even play an instrument. You shouldn\u2019t compare yourself to others in that regard. In my case, I do love music and I\u2019ve playing guitar for over 30 years. I can tell you there are lot\u2019s of people I know who play much better than I do but do not experience the same appreciation for music that I do (in my opinion). I also can say for how much I love music, I would think I would be a much better player by now. But, as it turns out, making music, either playing or writing, takes considerable and consistent practice. I simply have not demonstrated the commitment needed to become a great player or writer. Understanding that relationship for yourself is essential. It helps determine what kind of music participant you\u2019ll be. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. ",
