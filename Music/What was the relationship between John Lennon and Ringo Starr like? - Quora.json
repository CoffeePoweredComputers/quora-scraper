            "answer_text": "Ringo Starr was the only band member who none of the others had any hangs on. They were all his friends, though Ringo might have been quite pissed off when McCartney freaked out straight up in his face early 1970 (the well known Let\u2019s-send-Ringo-case), and later on when McCartney sued the band in 1971. Before Lennon left his wife and home in Weybridge in 1968, he spend a lot of time smoking pot and tripping with Ringo, who lived in the neighborhood. They might have been quite close in this period, and I believe that socially, Lennon was closer to Ringo than he was to McCartney and Harrison in the late Beatles-years. During their heroin-honeymoon in 1968, Lennon and Yoko Ono lived in an apartment in central London, owned by Ringo (btw it was in this apartment they got busted for drugs in the fall 1968). I don\u2019t know if they stayed there until they moved to Tittenhurst in 1969 - Ringo might have asked them to leave after the drug scandal, but their friendship remained. In 1973, Ringo bought Tittenhurst Park from the Lennons (I read somewhere that it was handed over to him as a part of the final settlement between the four of them) and it was his British residence until he sold it in 1985 (he moved to LA in 1973\u201374). Like George Harrison, Ringo supported Lennon in the Allen Klein-mess. Also, the two of them drank heavily together during the lost weekend in Los Angeles 1974. This year, Lennon wrote the title song, \u201cGoodnight Vienna\u201d, for Ringos follow up on his (very) successful 1973 \u201cRingo\u201d-album (on which Lennon also wrote the famous opening song, \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d - known as the nearest The Beatles ever came to a reunion; only Paul McCartney were missing). As Guy Reid-Brown mention in the comments below, shortly after the break-up in 1970, Lennon asked Ringo to play drums on his Plastic Ono solo album. Lennon could have asked any drummer in the world, no one would have declined, but he felt safe with Ringo who always knew how to support and strengthen Lennon\u2019s songs (edit.) Even during his 5-years break 1975\u201380, Lennon wrote songs for Ringo and joined his studio sessions in NYC now and then. As the only beatle, Ringo went straight on to visit Yoko Ono in The Dakota on 12/9. So, I believe the relationship between Ringo and Lennon was quite strong. By the way, who doesn\u2019t like Ringo? Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Although he was admittedly closest to George Harrison, Ringo got along well with all of his bandmates in The Beatles. in fact, he got The Beatles to sort of reunite during the recording of his album Ringo in 1974 as John, Paul and George either wrote songs, played in certain tracks or both althiugh not at the same. Lennon, in particular, specifically wrote I\u2019m The Greatest for Ringo in the album. Prior to his untimely demise, John wrote another song for Ringo, Nobody Told Me. Although Ringo never got to record it, Lennon was able to do a demo recording that was later mixed and released as a single for his posthumous album, Nobody Told Me. These are all indications that John and Ringo had a very good relationship until the former\u2019s passing. ",
