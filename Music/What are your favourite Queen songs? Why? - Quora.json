            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always liked Queen\u2019s music, but I had the pleasure of rediscovering them recently when \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d came on the car radio and my daughter instantly fell in love with the band. Our family went to see the Bohemian Rhapsody movie, and soon after I bought all the Queen albums I didn\u2019t have and listened to their entire catalog from beginning to end. In the process, I, too, became a much bigger Queen fan than I was before. There\u2019s so much good music in their deep catalog, with all four members serving up quality contributions, that it\u2019s hard to narrow down my favorites. With that being said, Brian May is probably my favorite songwriter in the band, so my list leans toward the harder-rocking material, though of course Queen would not have been Queen without Freddie Mercury, arguably the greatest frontman in the history of rock. So here\u2019s what my top 10 looks like today, although it could all change tomorrow \u2014 save for the song at the top of the list. Bohemian Rhapsody The obvious choice, but it\u2019s their career-defining song, and for good reason. Freddie had the vision for a multi-part dramatic rock opera in his head, and he pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the recording studio in 1975 to make it happen. Everything great about Queen is contained in those six minutes: theatricality, beautiful piano, rocking guitars, the stacked vocals and impossible falsettos, great imagination, and the courage to combine ideas that shouldn\u2019t work together into something that not only does work but becomes timeless, larger than life. Fat Bottomed Girls Written by Brian May, but Freddie gives such a perfect delivery of the lyrics that you\u2019d think he wrote it himself. He owns this song, with gusto, and somehow manages to take some campy, over-the-top lyrics and make them sound like the most important thing ever written. That grimy riff from Brian is one of his best moments, and the big singalong chorus is impossible to resist. \u201939 Brian May shows his versatility as a songwriter: Not only can he wrote scorching rockers, but he can also deliver a beautiful acoustic singalong. Brian himself sings this one, showing that he easily could have been a lead singer in any other band. We Will Rock You Stomp, stomp, clap! Stomp, stomp, clap! Nearly as iconic as \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d this is the ultimate fan-participation song, and it\u2019ll get you pumped in no time. Another Brian song, capped off by one of his greatest solos. That tone! The tone that no one else in rock has. You hear it, and you immediately know what guitarist you\u2019re listening to. Radio Ga Ga By the time this song came out in 1984, Queen had toned down the hard rock and embraced electronics and synthesizers. But their melodies continued to soar. This song, written by Roger Taylor, takes me back to my own childhood, when I\u2019d sit by the radio and listen to the new hits coming out. As a lonely kid, radio was my best friend, and music made everything OK. And did I mention the melodies? The tune on this song is straight from heaven. And, of course, if \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d is the ultimate fan-participation song, this one comes a close second. \u201cAll we hear is\u201d \u2014 clap! clap! \u2014 \u201cradio ga-ga\u2026\u201d Mustapha Easily one of the strangest songs in Queen\u2019s catalog, this one opens the Jazz album with Freddie Mercury imitating an Islamic call to prayer. The song launches into lots of lyrics about \u201cMustapha Ibrahim\u201d and how \u201cAllah will pray for you,\u201d intermingled with what sounds like gibberish, and all done with a flash of hyperactive zaniness and an exotic Arabic flavor to the music. I have no idea what Freddie was getting at with this song, but I don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s a work of genius, and completely unlike anything else Queen ever recorded. (Addendum to address one of the comments: The Persian-sounding bits are indeed gibberish, similar to the faux-Spanish John Lennon came up with for \u201cSun King.\u201d At best, Freddie\u2019s lines are a nonsensical word salad based on Farsi-sounding words and phrases.) Gimme the Prize Freddie Mercury and John Deacon supposedly both hated this song. It\u2019s loud, it\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s totally Brian May. This comes from their album A Kind of Magic, which overall is not one of their strongest outings. Some of the tracks were made for the movie Highlander, including this one. But this song, in my opinion, shines bright, placing some of Freddie\u2019s most aggressive vocals against the sounds of strident dialogue and clashing swords from the film, and it all culminates in a majestic solo from Brian that sounds like angry bagpipes confronting an army of sledgehammers. Makes my hair stand on end every time I hear it. Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon A cute little bit of Tin Pan Alley whimsy from Freddie that would almost be an inconsequential song, if not for Brian\u2019s ending guitar solo. It\u2019s a triple-tracked thing of beauty, as Brian harmonizes with himself. It\u2019s one of the happiest things you\u2019ll ever hear \u2014 guaranteed to make you smile. Get Down, Make Love As you might guess from the title, this song is deliciously filthy, from the musical arrangement to the way, way over-the-top lyrics. Only a small handful of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll frontmen could pull off lyrics like this without sinking into Spinal Tap self-parody, and Freddie was most definitely one of them. It has to be heard to be believed. Not to be missed is the freakout middle section, where Freddie\u2019s howls and screams intermingle with whirling sound effects and a thumping piano beat. It\u2019s basically Queen\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love,\u201d and it\u2019s fantastic. Innuendo On the last album Queen made while Freddie was still alive, the band went back to their roots for this adventurous title track. It moves dramatically through several sections and moods, including a rousing middle section of solo flamenco guitar played by Brian\u2019s friend, Yes guitarist Steve Howe. Freddie went out on a high note with this song and album. I could easily list 20 more songs. It\u2019s hard to pick only 10! ",

            "answer_text": "A lot, honestly. Some of my favourite Queen songs and why I like them include as follows:  Bohemian Rhapsody - While everything about this song is classic Queen, what stands out to me in this all-time famous tune is the dynamics and vocal harmonies present in the bridge. They are very difficult to pull off and only serve as a great, dynamic build-up to a very powerful climax (\"So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye...\"). The lyrics also deserve kudos, because they do not sound generic at all.  Crazy Little Thing Called Love - One of the easier Queen lead vocals to sing in my opinion, but certainly that does not mean it is one of my least favourite. Being interested in early rock 'n' roll such as Bill Haley & His Comets, early Beatles and Elvis Presley, this is a wonderful song to sing along with. John Deacon's bass line in this song is one of my all-time favourite bass lines, adding a lot of groove to this great tune.  Innuendo - This tune stands out to me particularly for that beautiful bridge that builds up to a powerful climax, as well as the flamenco solo done by Steve Howe. What was even more amazing is that Freddie did this at his weak point, i.e. just a while before his death due to AIDS, something that certainly cemented his status as one of the greatest singers of all-time.  I Want It All - Not only that Freddie delivers his best as usual here, but this song also contains some of Brian May's best ever guitar solos; he was being in his 'shredder mode' in this tune, but never sacrificed the melody of the song. When Brian really is in the mood of ripping it out, he really, really does it well.  Love Of My Life - What strikes me a lot in this tune are the beautiful vocals and harp playing. The lyrics might seem like your typical love tune but the composition and arrangement only makes it more beautiful and honest instead of cheesy. Even at their sappier moments, Queen delivers it well. No further comment. Give it a listen. :) Somebody To Love - I love everything about this tune - the gospel-like arrangement, Freddie's great vocals that not only consisted of very difficult high notes and melismas but also sounded vulnerable and emotional, Brian May's guitar solo, and the tight vocal harmonies. Only a band in the musicianship of Queen can really pull this difficult tune off.   Stone Cold Crazy - I love this tune a lot back in high school when I was a lot into heavy metal particularly for the pseudo-NWOBHM / speed metal feel. Although not a heavy metal band, this song showcases the band being very close to one, justifying their versatility even further.  Under Pressure - That bass. Nothing more to say. ",
