            "answer_text": "They were and are better musicians. There are some gifted musicians now but far and in between\u2026 Music back in early sixties were even shorter than now, between two and three minutes. If I remember right The Beatles Hey Jude was the first longest rock song to be played on the radio, over eight minutes long. Later it would be In a gadda De vida by Iron Butterfly, over twenty minutes long. Another thing why songs were long was because musicians and the public in this time period were taking huge amounts of L.S.D. 25. A powerful hallucinogenic. The whole world was tripping their asses off!!! I saw this phenomenon and I remember the sixties because I was a kid and not taking L.S.D. 25, just rocking out to the great music of that decade. Oh yeah, the first metal band was Blue Cheer, Eric Clapton agrees on this. I remember listening to them when I was ten years old. I still listen their first and second albums, great stuff, never gets old\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Long songs have been the exception for MANY years.  You mention a few bands who had long songs and I would add Dire Straits to the list but even some of these long songs had shorter versions because radio preferred it that way.  Short songs work better with radios format - two or three songs, talk, advertisement. If a long song is played and someone doesn't like it they are more likely to change station etcIt is also very hard to craft a long song well enough for people not to get bored generally you need great musicians who can make their instruments sing because a lot of words alone with boring music just gets boring and I question whether there are that many bands with the skills anymore.  I'm not saying that there aren't some talented musicians but you need a band full of them.The fans also seem to have shorter attention spans these days ",
