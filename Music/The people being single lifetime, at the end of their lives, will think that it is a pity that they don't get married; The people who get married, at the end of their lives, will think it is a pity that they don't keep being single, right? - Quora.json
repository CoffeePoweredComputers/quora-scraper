Sorry, I don\u2019t get the impression that, in terms of relationships, people operate under a universal \u201cthe grass is always greener on the other side of the fence\u201d algebraic formula. Culture, sub-culture, religion or lack thereof, gender, family, age\u2026 just to name several, all play a role in creating imperatives and attitudes about relationships and status. Some feel marriage is a must, others want nothing to do with it, and still others are ambivalent. Add to that messy pot of stew is the underlying assumption that marriage and the state of being single are the only two valid means of existing in the world. What of the Catholic Priest that chooses celibacy? What of the couple that never weds yet loves each-other for life? How does the formula account people that divorce yet stay good friends and yet do not regret marriage nor longed to be single when they were a couple? (*cough* *cough* the writer clears his throat while waving his arms and pointing to himself) Nah, people and relationships are far too complicated than to go walking along and scratching one\u2019s head thinking, \u201cIf only\u2026\u201d ",

I\u2019m at a point in my life I have 1 child who is 9 and I will not let another man be in my daughter\u2019s present, he will not steal my peace, and he damn sure isn\u2019t going to come in my life and leave because things got a lil hard for him.
