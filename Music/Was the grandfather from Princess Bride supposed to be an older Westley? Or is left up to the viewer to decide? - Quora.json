But the Renaissance took place between the 14th and 17th centuries. So unless you believe that somehow the grandfather is around 350 to 400 years old\u2026 then no it can\u2019t really be Wesley. In the book the grandfather doesn\u2019t actually exist, in the movie he is simply a grandfather reading his grandson a book. There is no deeper meaning involved. ",

It is up to the viewer to have at least a modicum of understanding of how the aging process actually works. ",
