            "answer_text": "How are you defining successful?  What does that mean to you?  The act  of just completing any production is a success so one could say any web  series is successful. It's a subjective question so you  need to be more specific on what you mean.  Do you define success as  starting a self-sustaining business, selling your series to a TV  network, getting YouTube  views, getting YouTube Subscribers, getting brand deals, getting paid,  getting an agent, getting a girl to like you, creating a calling card,  practicing your craft, etc.? Until you can get a clear idea of what your definition of success is, the best people can do is guess or give  examples of what successful means to them, which may not be the answers  you're looking for.

Halo: Forward Unto Dawn, BlackBoxTV, RCVR, The Booth at the End, Anyone But Me, The Bannen Way, Continuum, the aforementioned Sanctuary and Mortal Kombat, and there are plenty more. Genre isn't a determinate of success online as this question seems to suggest. The delivery medium is (kind of) different, but the type of shows people like to watch has not. Entertainment is entertainment. ",
