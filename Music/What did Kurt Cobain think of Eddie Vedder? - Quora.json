            "answer_text": "Some necessary background is that during that time there was what would today be an unimaginable feeding frenzy among record labels to slurp up underground and independent musicians in order to repackage and resell them as what youth culture means and ought to buy. Cobain is on record as finding Pearl Jam\u2019s music to be a fraudulent, commercial, careerist representation of rock being sold to kids (and he\u2019s right, but it\u2019s a little hypocritical given his own ambitions), and in particular calling out Jeff and Stone\u2019s jockish backgrounds, but was obviously charmed by Eddie after meeting him in person, and buried the hatchet with their minor feud carried on in the press. Eddie even impressed irascible Steve Albini during the breaks of recording Nevermind [edit: not Nevermind, In Utero] where he would prank call celebrities whose phone numbers made their way to Nirvana. Evan Dando and Gene Simmons, by comparisons, made fools of themselves on tape. ",

            "answer_text": "They were friends, they even danced together on one occasion. Gotta love how the media generates their own version of history to sell content. Just because you're friends with someone doesn't mean you love their music. I personally am friends with a country musician and i don't like or listen to country. We have spoken of our influences and preferences without any animosity. ",
