Any laptop should at least have these features: Wireless internet2 or more USB portsPort for external monitorIn general, for Windows 10, you\u2019re going to want more hard disk space and RAM. Windows 10, it\u2019s a resource hog, but it\u2019s widely used. For Linux, you can get by with less, especially if you carefully select the components you install. I won\u2019t get into all the different Linux distributions; that\u2019s not really my wheelhouse. If you want Linux, do your homework. Most of my advice will be from the Windows side of things, since that\u2019s where most of my experience is. C/C++/C#: On Windows, you\u2019ll probably want Visual Studio 2017 or later. Since it\u2019s free, you really can\u2019t go wrong with this fantastic IDE, but it does take a lot of resources. Get a laptop with a generous amount of RAM and hard disk space.Java: Takes a little less resources than the above languages if you use something like Eclipse. It will feel like it\u2019s using a lot of resources because it runs so slow, but it actually takes a wee bit less. Your requirements will be a bit less compared to C++/C#, but not much. Get a hefty dose of both.Python/JavaScript: Doesn\u2019t matter. These languages take so few resources that almost any computer will do. The thing that will bite you with Python, at least, is the IDE. Like most languages, you don\u2019t really need an IDE, but the people who don\u2019t use one are a called \u201cmasochists\u201d. I like PyCharm for Python, which uses a healthy dose of resources. Is there even an IDE for JavaScript? You can use a nice text editor and your browser of choice (which should be Chrome) as your debugger. Least resources of the above languages.Sorry I can\u2019t offer a specific brand and model number, but these change so frequently that by the time I recommended one, it would be discontinued and this answer would be stale. When I buy a laptop for programming, I get the absolute most computer I can afford. Max out on the RAM and hard disk space (but get an SSD if you can afford it). You don\u2019t really need the latest CPU; almost any late-model CPU is fine (but buy Intel, because I have stock in Intel). At some point you\u2019ll probably want to hook up your laptop to a real keyboard, mouse and monitor, hence the USB ports and external monitor hookup. Tip: the more USB ports, the better. TL/DR: Get the absolute most computer you can afford. Give priority to RAM and hard disk space; you need a CPU, but not a super-duper one. ",
