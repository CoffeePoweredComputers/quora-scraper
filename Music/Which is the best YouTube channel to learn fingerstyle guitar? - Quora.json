            "answer_text": "I wish I knew the definitive answer to that question but any answer will be subjective - what I like you may not like. I think it has a lot to do with how much help you need. I've been playing for about 40 years at this point so I don't generally look for sites that are targeted at beginning level players. If you are at a point where you dont need lessons that show you the basics but would like to learn songs I recommend checking out a site called Link n Riff - I'm not sure what the URL is but if you Google it you'll see multiple links but the one that says something like guitar education is the one to use. This guy has recorded tons of lessons where the subject is a given song. He shows you the way to play it and he provides handwritten tab for it too. He has lessons centered on rock, pop, Western, jazz and other songs. His arrangements seem to be his own but they are pretty accurate. He also has more theory oriented lessons on things like improvising and right hand techniques etc. This guy is prolific to say the least. They are not exclusively fingers style but there are numerous lessons on songs that feature finger style. I especially enjoyed his lessons based on songs written and performed by Jerry Reed and Chet Atkins. If you are serious about finger style guitar and haven't studied Chetan Atkins do yourself a favor and check out his technique and style in videos and for a special treat check out duets with Chet and Jerry. Two masters of the instrument and Jerry Reed is just a really funny and entertaining guy. They always had a good time on stage joking around before breaking into some mind blowing jams. If I have a complaint about this site it's the legibility of his handwritten tabs. He could use some practice with penmanship but it's free and there is just a lot of material there. He does take donations however. Hope you find something of value there. ",

            "answer_text": "Luckily for you, Sungha Jung (and I guess Tommy Emmanuel?) basically launched popularity in the fingerstyle guitar community, so many channels make arrangements and tab them out. Gareth Evans has a channel solely dedicated to making fingerstyle tutorials for free with tab. (Although I am personally against tabs) Gareth Evans other users include Peter Gergely, Eddie van der Meer , James Bartholomew, KellyValleau. All these guys have tabs available. The important part of learning fingerstyle guitar is this: Know about keys and key signatures.Know and be able to recognize chord progressions.The most basic way to make arrangements is to play the root of each chord with the thumb and the melody with the other fingers. Then add some rhythm with the other fingers as well.Observe techniques used by many youtubers/players like Igor Presnyakov, Sungha Jung, Tommy Emmanuel, Andrew Foy, and others mentioned above. Learn how to take the simple combination of chord + melody and get creative with it from them.Make sure you know what you are playing when you read these tabs. Many people don\u2019t, and that is why I always recommend sheet music.The examples above show the contemporary fingerstyle guitarists that use a lot of percussion, natural/artificial harmonics, and use of the left hand thumb. If you\u2019re not a fan, I recommend classical guitar and sheet music (I recommend this more than I would the previous method). It is not as flashy and more rigorous on technique. Message me for anything. Poyce. ",
