            "answer_text": "To learn it fast (which I think means quickly in this context), you have to do something counter-intuitively and learn it slowly.  This is one of the hardest concepts to adopt in practice. Almost every musician will have to learn this concept. As new musicians are faced with technical limitations (how comfortable they are with their instrument), playing phrases slowly allows for playing accurately.  The quickest way to learn to sing your song will be to learn each part slowly and make sure you are hitting the pitches and rhythms accurately. Learning at the piano will give you the greatest benefit. Once you learn it accurately in pitch and rhythm, you can gradually increase your tempo. You will find that singing at the original tempo will be far easier (and sound amazing) once you have done the work to slow down first.  The other benefit: if you learn to practice this way, you will learn very quickly. It probably seems like a painstaking and slow way to learn, but it has done wonders for my playing. On either of my instruments, I can learn melodies in less than half an hour with this method. Your voice is no different. You do have the added task of learning lyrics, but this method will help you there as well :) ",

            "answer_text": "Get a really good, reputable, recommended vocal teacher with a professional studio, take regular lessons, and practice daily to your recordings. Depending on your level of singing now, it will take years to perfect your technique, but you can usually see improvement on a daily or weekly if you practice faithfully. If you can afford more lesson time, such as an hour weekly instead of a half hour, or more than one lesson per week, it can help speed up your progress, because you will have the opportunity to get that solid feedback as you become aware of the sensations of various coordinations as you learn what it should feel like and sound like inside your head. Once you have a new sensation you are working on, it\u2019s critical to practice it before you forget what that sensation is like. There\u2019s no harm in doing some practice right after your lesson, as well as daily after that. The recordings will hopefully also help trigger that muscle memory. Fast when learning anything that involves muscle training is not going to be as fast as you hope. If you are completely untrained, you may have poor vocal habits you need to unlearn before you can move on to proper technique. Give it a solid 3\u20136 months to see any progress, assuming you get a great teacher and follow their guidance, and years, to really get your technique down solid. ",
