            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about complexity. Let me explain. There\u2019s \u201csimple\u201d jazz music and \u201csimple\u201d classical music as well\u2026 on paper. What I mean, it\u2019s not because it\u2019s simple that it is easier to play. For instance, modal jazz is harmonically talking, quite simple, as you\u2019re not in a tonal system, and the whole point is to simplify improvisation. That does not mean it is easier to play than classical music. There\u2019s also crazy over-the-top modern jazz, like music by David Binney or Harry Hoenig, and crazy modern music written for the classical orchestra like Rachmaninoff or Boulez. I coudn\u2019t even compare the complexity. It\u2019s a whole other world! Here I will try to describe the differences between both genres. I\u2019m a jazzman, nut my best buddy is a classical musician, so I\u2019ll try : 1 : The rythm.The very essence of music. Or is it? For jazz, yes! It\u2019s all about rythm and syncopated rythm, just to make classical folks freak out a little more. The swing feel - the idea of divising a beat unevenly, creating this feeling a \u201cjumping\u201d from a quarter note to another - needs, paradoxally, a steady pulse to works, much more so than classical melodies in general. Many jazzman will change parts of the melody on the fly - yes, even the greatest standards - and great players are most often noticed for their phrasing : their relation with the pulse, rather than their faitful interpretation or touch or tone. Those are very important things for sure, but rythm is key. The pulse of classical music can change greatly troughout the piece depending on the emotions. This is not the case with jazz. You can go half or double tempo, you can slow down or speed up a little over the course of a song, but the pulse remains steady. Unless we\u2019re talking about free-jazz\u2026 that\u2019s another thing\u2026 2 : The harmony.If you look at the most simple movements, 5\u20131 is at the number one cadenza (in classical music) or chord change (in jazz), and most jazz standards are based on 5\u20131 movements. 4\u20131 is most comminly found in classical music - it\u2019s present in jazz, too, but less. However 5\u20131 is premodinant over all occidental music styles. There\u2019s I think less modulation in jazz - classical pieces like sonata modulate from to the fifth in the form\u2026 I\u2019m not very knowledgeable about classical though\u2026 But, the chords in jazz are waaaaaaaaaay more complex in classical music, that I can assure you! While classical chords stops at V7, 4 notes, we have up to 7 notes at a time in a single jazz chord. In fact, the basic chords of jazz are all 7th chords, major, minor or dominant (V7), anf we add extensions to \u201ccolor\u201d the chords : 9th, 11th, and 13th. There ate rules and contrary to the belief of many classical musician, *it is extremely coded. You can also replace a chord with another in the same progression. This is called playin a \u201csub\u201d chord. I don\u2019t have the time to explain it, it\u2019s based on the tritone dividing the octave in two, anyway\u2026. Edit : there\u2019s diminished, sus4 chords etc as well 3 : The structureClassical music structure makes me wanna kill myself. Jazz structure is SIMPLE (yes, you heard it right). Most jazz standards are in a blues form or an AABA 32 bars form. The blues is 12 bars, 4 bars of 1, 4 of 4 and 4 of 5. AABA is simply 4 times 8 bars, the theme exposition, re-exposition, a variation, another exposition and we\u2019re back! Pretty damn straightforward. Why? Because we need to improvise, duh, keeping in mind the harmony. Yeah there\u2019s elements of improvisation in baroco music, but nowhere near jazz. Let the jazzmen scratch their heads at the chords and how to improvise on progressions; I\u2019ll leave the classical musician navigating to structures so complex they have to read 10 pages pf material to follow that. Screw it, LOL And that leads me to the major difference. Jazz is based on improvisation; classical music is based on interpretation. Apple and oranges. End of the story. Happy music!! ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all comparable, even taking into account the reality that in either jazz or \u201cclassical\u201d music\u2014or rather let us use the term Western art music\u2014some works are simpler than others. There is a world of difference between, say, some of Mozart\u2019s piano sonatas, which are nevertheless sublime in their simplicity and not at all easy to play well, and Mahler\u2019s 8th Symphony. Put very simply, in Western art music the complexity originates in the composer, with an added degree of complexity introduced by the interpreter, who is tightly bound to the intent of the composer, even in works that involve chance in performance. This is true even for many advanced works. For instance, take Steven Reich\u2019s In C. It\u2019s a minimalist work with no set orchestration and no set number of musicians, consisting of 53 short phrases and a part (usually piano) that sets a pulse by playing octave Cs in repeated 8th notes. I quote from the Wikipedia article: \u201cIn C consists of 53 short, numbered musical phrases, lasting from half a beat to 32 beats; each phrase may be repeated an arbitrary number of times. Each musician has control over which phrase they play: players are encouraged to play the phrases starting at different times, even if they are playing the same phrase. In this way, although the melodic content of each part is predetermined, In C has elements of aleatoric music to it. [4] The performance directions state that the musical ensemble should try to stay within two to three phrases of each other. The phrases must be played in order, although some may be skipped. As detailed in some editions of the score, it is customary for one musician (\"traditionally... a beautiful girl,\" Riley notes in the score) [5] to play the note C in repeated eighth notes, typically on a piano or pitched-percussion instrument (e.g. marimba). This functions as a metronome and is referred to as \"The Pulse\". Steve Reich introduced the idea of a rhythmic pulse to Riley, who accepted it, thus radically altering the original composition by Riley which had no rhythm. [6] In C has no set duration; performances can last as little as fifteen minutes or as long as several hours, although Riley indicates \"performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half.\" The number of performers may also vary between any two performances. The original recording of the piece was created by 11 musicians (although, through overdubbing, several dozen instruments were utilized), while a performance in 2006 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall featured 124 musicians. The piece begins on a C major chord (patterns one through seven) with a strong emphasis on the mediant E and the entrance of the note F which begins a series of slow progressions to other chords suggesting a few subtle and ambiguous changes of key, the last pattern being an alteration between B\u266d and G. Though the polyphonic interplay of the various patterns against each other and themselves at different rhythmic displacements is of primary interest, the piece may be considered heterophonic.\u201d One thing the Wiki article does not make clear is that each musician must start with the first phrase, which they may play as many times as they like, with no set timing between the repetitions, before moving on to the next. Once they have moved forward, they cannot move back. Here is the first recorded version:  And here is another performance:  I see this as firmly in the Western tradition, even with its aleatoric elements. Listen to at least 10 minutes of both. Even with differences in instruments and the choices made by the performers, it is still recognizably the same work. In jazz, the complexity is largely that of the performer, and jazz is largely unanchored in harmony, rhythm, and melody. To my admitted somewhat biased ears\u2014I freely admit that in general I loathe jazz\u2014it\u2019s chaos. It reminds me of the delightful little book The Dot And The Line, subsequently made into an equally delightful little film. The line is Western art music; the squiggle is jazz. See  Is chaos complex? No. ",
