            "answer_text": " Probably it wouldn\u2019t be bad at all. Sometimes I feel I have the same issue. Try to use that time to do something else, like reading a book, write down your thoughts in a journal (if you\u2019re into that sort of thing), watch an informational documentary. You can go ahead and listen to music, but use it as a treat, after you did something truly valuable with your time. At least that\u2019s one trick I\u2019ve been doing. And when I do listen to music, I enjoy the living hell out of it. ",

If you feel like you benefit from taking some time off from listening to music, if that break makes you come back with fresh ears when you\u2019re done, then by all means, go on a music fast! I know what you mean, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re being bombarded by something and you lose your sense of enjoyment of that thing, and taking a break from it is often very helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Not bad at all. Sometimes you just need a mental break from too much of one kind of stimulation. Reading books seems to be a good palate cleanser, or listening to educational materials while driving. Even just driving in silence can really put you at ease. Music doesn't always have to be your weapon of choice for serenity and/or fulfillment. ",
