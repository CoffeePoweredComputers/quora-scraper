            "answer_text": "I doubt that there\u2019s an acoustic reason. I could certainly see grooves as being decorative, or possibly structurally reinforcing for the heavy horn that\u2019s hanging out in midair above the record. I\u2019ve seen lots of fancy engraving on the horns, and while they make them look artistic, they\u2019re almost certainly only decoration for that large metal horn surface that is the most prominent visible part of a gramophone (and possible selling point in the store?). If you could add a photo it\u2019d be easier to comment. ",
