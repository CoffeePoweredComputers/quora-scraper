Of course, some will turn you down because *cough racism/bias* but you can sing, kinda dance, and know two of the three most important languages for k-pop idols (english, japanese, korean), so go ahead and try! Because if you don\u2019t try you might regret it later on, but if you do, and even if you fail, at least you won\u2019t regret.

            "answer_text": "Yes? I\u2019m assuming this is about the fact that you are American\u2026 Honestly, here\u2019s the tea\u2026 You do not have to be Korean to enjoy K-pop music. K-pop is a genre. It is a style of music. It is not music made by artists of a certain ethnicity. Yes, K-pop originated in South Korea and is built around the culture of it\u2019s parent country, but it is a global style of music. I have people at my school who love K-pop and I live in rural Australia!! If you are talented, have the right connections, know your music and are enthusiastic about your career, you have just as much shot at fame an artist in any other genre. Plus, if you make it big, you could create a statement from your ethnicity (similar to Eminem and the rap scene) I honestly think you\u2019re biggest hurdle here is the fact that you are young, and you\u2019ll grow out of that\u2026 ^laughs at own joke^ Sorry, that was uncalled for\u2026 Seriously though, the fact that you are 12 is you\u2019re biggest issue here. Keep to you\u2019re goal and you\u2019ll make it my friend!! Keep Living, Alex ",
