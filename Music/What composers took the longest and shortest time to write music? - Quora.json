As mentioned in another answer, Mozart and Rossini performed miracles of quickness in getting their music out. Rossini even claimed: \u201cGive me a laundry list and I will set it to music.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Mozart or Rossini are famous to have written very fast, that said, baroque and classical technique was made to make compositions easier, a set language from which you use patterns, a little like in jazz or pop-rock now, only much more complex. The best composers did works of genius with this language and pushed the boundaries. The more you came towards our days, the more time it takes to compose because composers had to take care to avoid things their predecessors did and that\u2019s quite hard.. Longest I have no idea but it must be on wiki somewhere. ",
