            "answer_text": "As a fellow ballad lover, I have to confirm\u2026They do not :( As you know, they have a rather intense and experimental discography, so ballads wouldn\u2019t always fit. But, they do have some songs that are more calm or chill. 19I know that this song has some intense raps (we love Hyunjin and 3RACHA~) but it does have a pretty chill beat to it. It\u2019s also really melancholic and slow (sometimes), so it make give you what you\u2019re looking for.GLOWThe same can be same about this one, but it\u2019s a little different. This song would fall under the category of \u201cmelodic rap\u201d, so the raps have more smooth grooviness to it (if that makes sense); this song is pretty chill, too.Mixtape #2This song is consists of mainly acoustic guitar, so it\u2019s more soothing and calm than most of Stray Kids\u2019 songs. It\u2019s also really sweet, so while it\u2019s not a ballad, it can give the same type of feeling while you listen to it.Hero\u2019s SoupThis definitely isn\u2019t a ballad, but I\u2019m mentioning it because it\u2019s chill like 19, especially during the chorus. It\u2019s also really sweet song, so it can make you feel calm and happy.That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for you, but I do have a few artists that make ballads, so you might like them.
