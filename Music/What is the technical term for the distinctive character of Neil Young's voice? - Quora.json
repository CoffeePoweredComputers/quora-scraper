            "answer_text": "One would assume his singing style is just overused falsetto. However, technically his singing style is countertenor, a very unique and uncommon vocal range. As defined by Wikipedia, A countertenor (or contra tenor) is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types, generally extending from around G3 to D5 or E5, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C4 to C6. Countertenors often are baritones or tenors at core, but rarely use this vocal range in performance. Neil can sing very low notes, but rarely does so. On songs like Motion Pictures, \u201cI\u2019d rather start all over again.\u201d is probably the lowest point in his range he reaches. ",

Unique, though not a technical term, is what I would call his voice. Sorry that I didn\u2019t have an answer for you. But if Neil Young, by chance, ever happened to read this, I betcha he would laugh at my joke. ",
