            "answer_text": "\u201cAre there strip clubs where girls are fully naked?\u201d Sure there are. Not all countries are as prudish as the United States. There are lots of countries where full nudity, either professional as a stripper or public as on a beach, aren\u2019t really such a big deal. Although I haven\u2019t visited a strip club for decades when I was taken to one on a business trip in the States I was shocked to find out that the dancers had to keep G-strings on and sometimes even pasties, and yet the patrons of the bar were going wild as if it was a big deal while I found it kind of boring and paid more attention to my drink than to the semi-clothed dancers. It\u2019s probably more common in most countries for strippers to go completely naked than it is for them to have to wear something. It makes the whole thing seem sort of pointless. ",
