            "answer_text": "Anti-Christian, no. But let\u2019s take a closer listen. The sentiments of the song Imagine are lovely. A better world is certainly to be desired and a world full of people at peace is worthy of our best dreams. The scriptures state that \u201cwithout a vision, the people perish\u201d and the beginning of a preferable future begins with the imagination of a poet, or a prophet. The prophetic imagination kept hope alive for Israel\u2019s people through enslavement, nomadic existence, persecution, and exile. Into such a world Jesus (and John before him) came proclaiming the good news (gospel) of God\u2019s kingdom coming to set the world right. Lennon\u2019s song is inviting a different kind of imagining. When examined closely, Lennon\u2019s lyrics only describe peace as the absence of conflict, arrived at only because there\u2019s \u201cnothing to kill or die for.\u201d Remove the source of any disagreement and conflict is assuaged, but of what value is such peace? Here, Lennon\u2019s words have more in common with the writer of Ecclesiastes (i.e. accept that life \u201cmeaningless\u201d and full of \u201cvanity\u201d and that\u2019s the best one can know). Jesus offers a different kind of peace, \u201cmy peace I give you, not as the world gives, do I give you.\u201d Peace, as Jesus presents it, must be \u201cmade.\u201d And it is nothing to \u201ckill for\u201d though he judged it worth \u201cdying for.\u201d \u201cFor God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.\u201d (Colossians 1:19\u201320) God, dwelling among us as the man Jesus, reconciled us with our Creator, taking upon himself the curse of death, the corrupting force welcomed into this world by our rebellion symbolized in the story of Adam. In Jesus, God became flesh and as man, lived under the loving rule of his Father. And unlike the first \u201cAdam\u201d he fulfilled his human purpose, and went on to fulfill his divine mission, to exemplify the goodness of God against the corruption of this accursed world \u2014 healing sickness, driving out dark possessing spirits, and raising the dead. He also perfectly expressed the love of God for the just and unjust alike, loving all - even the despised and rejected with the same love he knew from His Father. He opposed what religion had done to his people, he proclaimed the end of \u201creligion\u201d as his people had known it, and offered the good news of forgiveness and acceptance and forgiveness of outsiders, beyond the walls build by religious temples, laws, and sacrifices. He, himself, took upon himself the sin and shame of crucifixion, using even his last breaths to ask for the forgiveness of his enemies. And to show the truth of all he said and did, God raised him back to life. He surprised his followers days later with his word of greeting, \u201cPeace.\u201d Imagine a world then, where this peace, born of unconditional love and acceptance, is planted like seed in the hearts of those who believe his message. Those who submit their lives to His rule in their lives, and find themselves \u201cimmersed\u201d in the Spirit of his love. These he proclaimed will be blessed, for they will become \u201cpeacemakers\u201d the children of God. The kingdom of God is enacted and shared throughout the world through those who carry his presence within, and whose love knows no boundaries, countries, religions, races, are all superseded through those who follow him. The church that uses Christ\u2019s name has so often failed, that few believe that the world has little hope of peace from those who claim to follow Jesus. Many will call such dreamers indeed. But, \u201cwe\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d \u2018In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.\u201d (Acts 2:17) The kingdom of God is yet approaching, let all who welcome it, think anew, adjust their lives accordingly, and believe the good news. Amen. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I suppose you could argue that it is vaguely anti-religion, with the lyrics: Imagine there's no countriesIt isn't hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion, too But even that is only tangentially anti-religion, since he is only \u201cimagining\u201d it, and not advocating for it. You could argue that many of the things Lennon \u201cimagines\u201d are the song are completely in line with Christian principles, including: No senseless warsDetachment from material possessionsThe sinfulness of greedHelping the hungry (that\u2019s one the Beatitudes)\u201cAll the people/Living life in peace\u201d",
