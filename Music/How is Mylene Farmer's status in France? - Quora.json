            "answer_text": "It\u2019s\u2026 fine. I feel like she\u2019s not as popular as she once was, but she\u2019s still well-known. She has a lot of die-hard fans but her music is quite peculiar so it\u2019s the kind of music you love or you hate. She\u2019s not very much in the public eye, but she\u2019s recognized as a well-known French singer. That\u2019s about it really, nothing much. ",
