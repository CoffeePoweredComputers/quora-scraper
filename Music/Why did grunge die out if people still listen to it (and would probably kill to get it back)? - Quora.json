            "answer_text": "If Nirvana were to have gone on to make 8 other albums that sounded like Nevermind and In Utero the same thing would have happened to them. You cannot deny great music that stands the test of time, but artists must still evolve to keep your interest. Just like bands such as NoFX or the Offspring had periods where they were commercially viable but for the most part, people miss most of their derivative material and just reminisce on the moments when everyone was paying attention, although they are still active. But still, new artists draw inspiration from old music all the time, but technology of today makes it difficult to recapture the same type of inventiveness groups like the Beatles, or Nirvana were able to tap into out of sheer necessity. If Grunge were to come back to day in the same state it was in 1990 people might really dig it but there is a good chance anyone who has heard Nirvana or Alice and the like, will write it off as a knock off, check Puddle of Mudd or Nickelback.. Sorry for being long winded, but pop culture also has a lot to do with it and how trends come and go, for instance there are pockets of people who still only listen to punk rock, but then there are some who think it ended when Blink-182 stopped being on the charts, so the answer to your question is people still listen to every kind of music, and grunge never died because there are still bands out here who aspire to make music like Kurt and someone out here who listens to them.
