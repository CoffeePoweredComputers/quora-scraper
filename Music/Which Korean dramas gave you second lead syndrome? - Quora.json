            "answer_text": "I have watched several K Dramas but none gave me the second lead syndrome as much as BOF gave due to Ji Hoon\u2019s character. I sometimes wonder if actually he was the second lead or was just called the second lead because he didn\u2019t get the girl. What a hilarious drama. Jandi enrols into Shinwa high school without her interest and on the very first day itself finds herself drooling over Yoon Jihoo. He was nothing short of a dream with impeccable hair, expensive clothing and violin in his hand. As she got more and more attracted to Jihoo, she became more and more disgusted with GJP for his atrocities on fellow students. So far so good. You will even like Jandi in the beginning. Finally Jandi comes to know Jihoo is stuck upon his past and love another. She even pleads her not to leave Jihoo and encourages him to follow her to Paris. Suddenly GJP decides that Jandi loves him for no reason and starts considering her his private property. Gets her kidnapped for a makeover and even forcibly takes her on a vacation abroad. Not just this he pushes himself on her so many times and is always rude to her. He even tries to get her terminated when he sees Jihoo and Jandi kissing. But then suddenly, Jandi realises she love GJP, like how. The writers gave us scenes building jihoo jandi relationship and when one gets completely smitten by their dreamy romance you tell us the one for Jandi is GJP. There is no chemistry, no relationship building between them and then you bring the most cliche plot of witch mother declaring war against sons love life. Like who is interested? Nobody cares if GJP would end up with Jandi or not because you are not yet out of Jihoo\u2019s charm. Then you won\u2019t leave it at that, you will make GJP abusive and foolish who cannot protect his love from his own mother and on the other hand will show Jihoo caring for her in ways GJP can never. Its any crisis in Jandi\u2019s life and if GJP rescues her it comes as a surprise as you don\u2019t even care if he is there, you want Jihoo to always come for her. Can you give a sweeter guy than Jihoo? Just see all his scenes to fall in love with him in every single one of them and then show us Jandi completely friendzone him. Like you admit he is your first love, you admit he is your soulmate and yet you friendzone him? If she was never in love with him, it would have made some sense but not when he is your first love and is insanely nice to you not to forget insanely handsome too, also not to forget that he plays guitar, violin, piano to perfection and sings beautifully. And then they show us GJP with atrocious furry attires, constant scowl and permed curly hair, like could there be any saving grace for him that we even for once accept him the male lead. Then you constantly make the lead couple fight and separated and give us Jihoo Jandi going on multiple pseudo dates, and make them all endearing and then again tell us GJP is the one for Jandi. And then you give Jihoo a stellar haircut, ear piercing, glasses and make him look hotter( as if he was any less), give us their wedding shoot, their temple visit, a monk predicting them as family, both washing his car together, her cooking for him, nursing him to health when he got ill, living together in Macau and enjoying when a moment ago she had been jilted by her lover who called her a stain. You even made him accidentally walk into her bathroom, you gave them their own meeting place, her first hug, her first forehead kiss, first lip kiss, first date even a grandfather who adored her and wanted her as DIL\u2026.and then you tell us to see irritating GJP as her love interest. This was a show where they did nothing to create a male lead, the story moves around the second lead and the female lead who have hell of a chemistry. So in the end when she was studying medicine with Jihoo for 4 years and even the little girls wanted to marry their Doctor Prince Jihoo after growing up, our very own Jandi with iq lower than those kids would jump at GJP proposal out of the blue after 4 years of separation was too foolish and yes it gave me my first K drama second lead syndrome and till date the only one however i have watched many K-Dramas. The other K-Dramas where although i did appreciate the second lead still did not get the SLS were The Heirs, My love from the stars and Strong girl Bong-Soon. In all of these shows, the second lead had good roles but the first lead had an edge. I did however like the second lead in The Heirs a lot but still Lee Min Ho\u2019s presence was so strong to not let me get the second lead syndrome but in BOF the game changed. I am yet to see another drama with such a strong second lead as Yoon Ji-Hoo of BOF that Lee Min Ho completely non existed for me. ",

            "answer_text": "I have watch many K dramas over the last few months and there was only one that gave me serious second lead syndrome and that was this drama right here!  The writers actually did a poor job in my opinion because there was no way Jan- Di should have ended up with Jun-pyo, she should have been with Ji-hoo. There reason I was upset about this and felt the writers made a mistake in the direction of the drama is because of the following. Jan-di and Ji-hoo actually spent more time together throughout the drama. There were more scenes with them than with her and Jun pyo.Jan-di and Ji-hoo were friends first. They actually built there friendship which I believe leads to a stronger, more lasting relationshipThe writers confused the audience because they clearly said that Jan-di and Ji-hoo were soul mates. The writers also said that Jan-di would make a family for Ji-hoo, in retrospect, yes I know it means unite him with his Grand dad but still that is pretty misleading.Ji-hoo\u2019s grandfather personally approved of Jan-di (unlike Jun pyo mother) and said he selected her for Ji-hooThey had a mock wedding where the second lead even had a wedding ring to give the main lead.. like this isnt confusing for the fans These were some of the reasons why I felt that the second lead should have gotten the girl. Jun pyo loved Jan di but I felt Ji-hoo was in love with her which is a difference. Also, look at the ending of the drama. Jun pyo went to the US and Jan di went to medical school (which is cool ) but she spent her entire time in medical school with Ji-hoo.. wtf again spending more time with him than her supposed boyfriend. Finally at the end Jun Pyo shows up out of no where and ask to marry her and she says Yes but I was like are you friggin kidding me. It was the WORSE K drama ending I have seen. I would rather her not be with either of them than to just marry Jun pyo. Apparently, I wasnt the only fan to feel this way because countless people were upset and made memes like this  If they do a remake hopefully, the do better in this regard. ",

            "answer_text": "Please read to the end because i feel VERY strongly about this. I don\u2019t usually get second lead syndrome\u2026 BUT Jinguk from dream high. I can\u2019t believe he didnt end up with the girl. -He knew her longer. Before we even meet samdong, jinguk and hyemi already went through a lot together and already formed a special bond. -He understood her better. While Samdong thought she was just this delicate and fragile girl, Jinguk recognised that she is much tougher and stronger than she looks. (we stan guys who are secure enough with their own masculinity to not feel threatened by strong females) -Hyemi was more comfortable around him. She laughed a lot with Samdong, but didnt feel comfortable enough around him to cry. She cried in front of Jinguk, though. -He was the one who advised Hyemi about whether she should go to the States or not. This proves that she really values his opinion. -Samdong fell in love with her because of her appearance, while Jinguk fell for her personality. -Hyemi and Jinguk\u2019s date on the ferris wheel was very sweet. They even kissed!!! How did they not end up together???? Hyemi and samdong never did anything that special. -Jinguk understood that although he liked Hyemi, she is at fault sometimes. He didn\u2019t protect her when she stole the pendant from baek-hee. This says so much about him. He doesn\u2019t let his emotions blind his values and he doesn\u2019t lie to hyemi about what is right or wrong but instead guides her to become a better person. -He was the one who Hyemi sang to during their monthly evaluation. Hyemi cared about him enough to risk the bet she made with baek-hee and used that time to sing to him about her genuine feelings towards him. -Jinguk understood Hyemi\u2019s decision to tell baek-hee to hide the fact that she was molested. He realised that saving himself would ruin baek-hee. He did not get angry, or resent Hyemi for making a rational decision. He liked her even though she did this. -Samdong seemed quite cocky but fragile if you ask me. He couldn\u2019t deal with the fact that Hyemi liked Jinguk and when she cried about Jinguk leaving for his debut, Samdong just got angry. This is not cute at all?!?! His ego couldn\u2019t handle it and this annoyed me sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. -jinguk is just a generally nicer guy. He protects baek-hee even when he doesnt like her. Samdong only protects Hyemi because he likes her. So, Samdong protects Hyemi for selfish reasons while Jinguk protects people who need it. Samdong also expects Hyemi to like him beacause he protects her???? like he gets angry that she doesnt like him (see previous point) and this is\u2026well\u2026 says a lot about his character. -Hyemi had a better connection with Jinguk than with Samdong. She even had history with Jinguk and she really understood him. She understood him enough to know when it was appropriate for her ask him stuff and when he looked too \u201ctired\u201d for it. Overall, I think that poor scriptwriting was the reason Hyemi and Samdong ended up together. I STILL CANT BELIEVE JINGUK DIDNT GET THE GIRL ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ",

            "answer_text": "I am surprised that only one answer mentioned about school 2015: who are you. Who are you: school 2015:  This is one of my favorite k-dramas of all time. I had a serious second-lead-syndrome. To be honest, han-yi-an shouldn't deserve Lee-Eun-bi. Gong tae-kwang had always been with Lee eun bi and have helped her when nobody even knew the real her and he loved her to the fullest. Whenever he encounters her being sad, he tries to make her smile and even buys her food when she didn't wish to eat, isn't that cute? Whenever the bully tries to put lee eun bi down, he just runs over and tries to save her from the bully and help her all over again. For heaven\u2019s sake, when she didn't come to school, he just ran like hell from school and found her, stayed with her. Honestly, the lead character han-yi-an has everything, a wonderful father and the best swimmer, and he is very popular as well. Gong tae-kwang is the most deserving since he has an asshole father and doesn't even have friends, never really wished to be close with anyone other then lee-eun-bi. The writer showed us that they would be the end game by making him date her and being intimate with him rather than han-yi-an, she will be mostly with gong-tae-kwang than han-yi-an and she shared all the secret with him rather than han-yi-an.  This is the scene where everyone would have cried a lot. He is the sweetest person, and he deserves the girl and not han-yi-an.  Han-yi-an is a nice guy, but he was also a jerk towards her once he learned her identity and started to mistreat her, and even then, gong-tae-kwang was with her and helping her. I was on the verge of stop watching the series; the writer messed up the story with a love triangle when they could have made it better. Apparently, it is not just me, but the entire fanbase of this drama wished that she should have ended up with second lead rather than the first lead. ",

There are other series that just don\u2019t have the second lead syndrome, but are worth watching. However I\u2019ll save those for a later day. Enjoy! P.S.

Dream High   I REALLY WANTED SO BAD FOR TAECYON AND SUZY TO END UP TOGETHER. I swear, if ever some of you have seen this drama, won't you agree with me? They had overflowing chemistry, I can't get over it until now.She Was Pretty   Maybe it's due to my long time bias but I really desperately hoped for a different ending. I soooo wanted Hwang Jung-eum to end up with Choi Siwon my love. He was so thoughtful and sweet all throughout the series\u2026 and his character was also so cool. It's a story where the Perfect guy doesn't really end up winning the heart of who he wants.Special Mention: Full House tandem of Song Hye Kyo and Kim Sung-soo   ",

It\u2019s a good drama, but while I did like the male lead, I LOVED the second lead. He was just way more interesting to me as a character, and I got attached lmao. Also, I think the relationship was developed way more with the second lead (I watched this drama 3 years ago, though). I don\u2019t watch too many dramas with romance, so this is one of the few I\u2019ve seen that had a love triangle. So I can\u2019t really think of any others where I loved the second lead a lot more than the male lead. But I know there are others where I liked them almost equally. ",
