It is not just a monster of the week, not a military battle in space. It is Commentary on Humanity. A goal to which Society should aspire. A galaxy of united federation of planets where (almost) all are accepted and treated as equalsBe they White, Black, Asian, blue, green, volcan, Klingon, carbon based biped, energy based omnipotent, artificial or a life form we don't yet understand. Star trek the next generation episode \"The measure of a man.\" Season 2 episode 9 aired before I was born but is still my favorite.The character data Is a Android True artificial intelligence Thinking and learning for himself. An engineer talks an admiral Into transferring Data under his command So he could do a highly experimental Operation That could have give him amnesia Or even kill him. His Captain Forces a hearing to establish His rights As an individual. Given limited staff Ricker his direct supervisor and one of his best friends must argue that he is a machine, property, and not worthy of individual rights. Picard must defend. They argue back and forth whether he is property of star Fleet Or not But it comes down to If he is a Slave Or if he is an individual with rights. Simply because he is artificial Does he matter.That is what star trek was supposed to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Star Trek has as much hard sci-fi science in it as serial shows like Bones or CSI have actual, credible forensic or investigative science. Star Trek is an entertainment serial at its root, with much more of its overtones credited to and influenced by Wagon Train, with a dash of Horatio Hornblower and Gulliver's Travels thrown in, than anything else. In fact, Gene Roddenberry used Wagon Train to the Stars as a working title, with CBS purchasing it and running it specifically to rival the lock on Westerns that NBC had at that time. In a manner similar to Indians (Native Americans) appearing on Wagon Train, Star Trek would introduce a myriad of other alien species, a new one each week (it seemed), ranging from Klingons to Romulans to Andorians to Tholians to Organians. Interactions with these other species may have been tempestuous, but it was always resolved with negotiated settlement, with controlled violence as an absolute last resort. Sheyeah right, \"Military science fiction\" indeed. Sure, there was techno-babble, but solutions to challenges were not found by any actual scientific method. Instead, some scientific-sounding solution was concocted, partly real, partly exaggerated, partly fanciful, but the emphasis was placed on the teamwork and collaboration to solve said problems. Star Trek was, essentially, a morality play. Roddenberry fought the network repeatedly regarding a number of things, mostly about having a multiracial cast (he won, for the good of us all), a multinational crew (he won, but not without some tension), a bi-gender cast (it wasn't without its chauvinism, though), and \"space shootouts\" (Roddenberry, despite being a bomber pilot veteran, abhorred violence and warfare), which the network leads insisted on to attract a bigger audience. According to Roddenberry, Star Trek was an expression of an utopia. It wasn't the Federation Navy \u2013 it was Starfleet. Phasers stunned. Death was a tragic finality, not an arbitrary, ambiguous statistic... despite the parade of Redshirts meeting their ends on away missions. Ranks were not important; roles were. There were no captain's bars or sergeant's stripes; the differentiation in uniforms were in accordance to departmental assignment, and were one of the few things Roddenberry embraced once the costume department introduced the new wardrobes. The \"gold/yellow\" was supposed to be green, but initial test swatches failed to show up on chromakey green-screen. That's not to say that Star Trek was without science fiction elements. It did the best it could in employing those principles, and it certainly became more robust over the years and through follow-on series. Star Trek: The Next Generation made great efforts to return to those roots, but it suffered from the same limitations that faced The Original Series, which Roddenberry shared with Isaac Asimov at such lengths that Asimov became an uncredited \"sounding board\" of approval for Roddenberry. The challenges and restrictions of an hour-long, episodic, television show, measured by ratings not by scientific accuracy meant that liberties had to be taken constantly. It wasn't until Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan did we see the infusion of military (naval) style and action. This was at the direction of Nicholas Meyer, who was brought onboard to the franchise by Harve Bennett, himself assigned the task of reinvigorating Star Trek while staying within a studio budget. While Roddenberry had fashioned Kirk and the crew as a Horatio Hornblower -esque dashing captain in space, using wit and feats of humane heroism to win the day, Meyer took that and ran with it, noting that Hornblower's tension was due to its setting on the unforgiving seas, and the fervor of the Napoleanic Wars in full throat. Yes, the Royal Navy was out, sailing the globe, making scientific discoveries and charting new territories and peoples, but it was a martial entity, first and foremost, and the defense of the (British) empire was paramount. Meyer stressed that what Star Trek glaringly lacked was a proper villain. He wasn't prepared to (re)employ the Klingons just yet, but he did identify the potential tension in Khan Noonien Singh. Thus, a Captain Ahab / Moby Dick theme unfolded, set within the conflict stylings of Das Boot (the Battle of the Mutara Nebula) and Master & Commander (the trading of broadsides to start the conflict). Subsequent films and television series would adhere more to these standards than with any depictions of \"epic naval space battles\". This was only challenged and altered by two plotlines/storylines \u2013 Deep Space 9's fixed position in space, and the introduction of the Borg. DS9 began as a neutral point of negotiation and cooperation. When that novelty wore off, writers began to explore the concept of the DS9 station returning to its roots as a military outpost, and treating it as a Rock of Gibraltar while several opposing factions would do battle around and through it. The Borg became the ultimate villain. Unlike any other conflicting force in the Star Trek universe, there was such unwavering simplicity to their reasoning that there was no negotiating with them. No military power could resolutely stand in their way. The vaunted Battle of Wolf 359 was an absolute slaughter, but do note, any depictions from it do not focus on or showcase military tactics, deployments, actions or maneuverings. The space battle is remarkably and chillingly brief. Why's that? Why isn't it this protracted, epic space battle? Because, what needs to be emphasized to the audience is how absolutely invincible the Borg are, and that it's going to take something more and undeniably different than military contributions to overcome them. \"Star Trek is military science fiction\"... Pfffft... Hogwash. ",
