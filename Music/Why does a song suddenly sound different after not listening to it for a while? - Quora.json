            "answer_text": "There are multiple factors at play in the situation described. If you\u2019ve been listening to a song recently, you are inhabiting the presence of the song far more strongly - you anticipate the beats, and the chord changes. You may find yourself performing air guitar or air drumming along with the music, if it\u2019s that sort of song. If you haven\u2019t listened to it for a while, that immediacy is replaced with memories of other things and events that you associate with the song, or when you heard it previously (in general terms, not specifically - but there are exceptions). You tend to collapse time and events into a bundle of related occurrences that form a collective impression, and you are reminded of that impression by the trigger of the music. The association between these impressions and the music colors the perception of that music. If it\u2019s been long enough, there may even be an additional layer, that of nostalgia. So that\u2019s the second factor. A third factor is that when you\u2019ve been listening to a song recently, your current emotional state tends to get introduced into the way you react to the song. Time lends emotional distance. So that\u2019s a third factor. Finally, when something is very familiar, you often react not to what you are hearing but to what you think you heard the last few times you\u2019ve listened to that song. You relate more to your perceptions of the music and not to what is actually there. When you listen to a song for the first time in a while, the immediacy of those impressions is absent, and you hear the song with - as the saying goes - fresh ears, and respond to the actual content. So there are a lot of influences altering the way we react to a given piece of music, and on top of the direct impact of those influences, they can interact in strange and unexpected ways. For example, there was a time in Australia (I was 15 or 16) when the favorite song of AM radio stations playing popular music late at night was \u201cGoodbye Stranger\u201d by Supertramp. If you scanned up and down the dial, stopping when you heard something you liked and moving on when you heard something you didn\u2019t, that song would come up more regularly than any other. It was only a period of 4\u20136 weeks, but the association is indelible within my mind - I hear that song and I am instantly transported back to my bedroom in the family home, tuning the dial on my radio up and down while lying in bed and trying to fall asleep. (The story may make more sense when I point out that I grew up a long way from the state capital, and the only time I could receive radio stations playing popular music was late at night). So, in listening to that song now, I am responding as much to the memory of those relatively innocent times, and high school, and the way the street light shined through the trees between my window and the street, as to what I\u2019m actually hearing. But I\u2019m actually able to hear the song itself more clearly, if I pay attention to it. Sometimes, we humans can be very complicated creatures. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the manner that the brain preserves a memory. Memories are preserved hierarchically according to intensity of sensation caused by the experience. Say for example that your first taste experience of nasty was spinach, and your first taste of delicious was chocolate Ice cream.The brain assigns a value of (-1) to spinach and a value of (+1) to chocolate ice cream. Your next experience of nasty was kale which you consider to be almost, but not quite, as nasty as spinach, and your next taste of delicious was vanilla ice cream, which was better than the chocolate.The brain reassigns a value of (-2) to the spinach, and assigns a value of (-1) to the kale.The brain assigns a value of (+2) to the vanilla and leaves chocolate at the (+1). Then you try Pistachio which you will take if there isn\u2019t any vanilla or chocolate around and the values change to (+3) for vanilla, (+2) for chocolate and (+1) for Pistachio.Then you try strawberry which you like better than chocolate, but still prefer vanilla and the values become (+4) for vanilla, (+3) for strawberry, (+2) for chocolate and (+1) for Pistachio. The chocolate ice cream still tastes good, but there are other things that taste better, so though the chocolate still tastes good, it \u201cseems\u201d to be not quite as good as you remember it being from the first time you tasted it. Sounds work the same way.The first time you heard it, it was the greatest thing you had heard to date, when you hear it again a year later, you\u2019ve heard at least ten things that were greater. ",
