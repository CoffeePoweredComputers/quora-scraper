            "answer_text": "Original question: What song, happy or sad, will you never skip? Go Your Own Way by Fleetwood Mac. I love the beat and the rhythm of this music so much that at one time I tried playing it on a loop on my laptop to get me hyped up while finishing some articles that I needed to submit to my editors. My mother thought I just broken up with my girlfriend and it seemed I was trying to busy myself in order to ignore about the whole thing. \u201cLoving you isn't the right thing to do How can I ever change things that I feel? If I could maybe I'd give you my world How can I when you won't take it from me?\u201d Go Your Own Way is considered by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the greatest rock songs of all time. The music is actually a breakup song written and sung by Fleetwood Mac lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham with his co-band player/girlfriend singer Stevie Nicks. \u201cTell me why everything turned around Packing up shacking up's all you wanna do If I could baby I'd give you my world Open up everything's waiting for you You can go your own way (go your own way) You can call it another lonely day\u201d That\u2019s my take.

            "answer_text": "I can not say just one! Songs have been my only way to explain, express or define my whole life\u2026literally! When i was raised all the drama all the trauma all the inconsistent different directions left me with only one way to describe myself. Honestly! I was, as a young child too afraid to say what i needed to say. As a teen saying anything that went against the family traditional ways of life, destroyed my whole outlook not only on life, but on me, myself. They all saw me as fat, stupid & ugly! And when I had no one inside my family to protect, support or strengthen my ways of thinking or even looking different i had to fight for myself, if I wanted to survive, and I truly believe from where I've been, where I am and how I got to be who I am, with God's hand hugging and His shoulder carrying me, I must say, I am so proud of myself! I fought and I won! It was an extreme challenge but I won! I've been in several accidents, suffered many physical damages, many surgeries that will be with me forever. But this last accident which I awoke to see beside me such stunned and confused faces on people I'd never seen in a place I'd never been asking me simple questions to validate my id. Listening trying to grab on to what they were saying and hearing them say several times, to this day, \u201choney, you're here for a reason\u201d or \u201cyou are certainly one blessed soul\u201d or \u201c God certainly was watching over you\u201d! It has been just over two years since that accident and it appears to have just started to process. So when you ask about songs happy or sad that will never leave my mind, I can not pick just one! What i can do is give you four titles and maybe you will understand\u2026 The Rose - Bette Midler - before accident When you've been blessed - Patti LaBelle - after accident Why me Lord - Percy Sledge ( originally by Kris Kristofferson) You Raise Me Up - Josh Groban It's a whole new world so watch out people I'm coming through! (well, you know, not everybody, just in general) ",
