            "answer_text": "Ive experienced sleep paralysis many times without anything unusual taking place but there was one occasion where it seemed to me I was sleeping normally when I awoke thinking I felt my husband nuzzle up and spoon me. I was certain of it. I turned over and there was no one was there so I simply shrugged it off as part of a vivid dream and went back to sleep. A bit later I was positioned on my stomach when I awoke to the very physical sensation of a man lying on top of me pressing into me; I heard a creepy, pervy audible cackle in one ear and then felt my breast being groped. I went to sit up and I couldn't move and began trying to force my limbs to move and tried to shout with all my might \u201cget out! \u201c but it came out garbled and slow. I continued trying to speak until I could finally shout \u201cI cast you out in the name of Jesus Christ! I invoke universal law and you have no place here! You must obey and leave this home immediately! You are not welcome here and I cast you out and bind you from returning to this place. It is my home and my free will and in accordance you must leave. Be gone! \u201c. I believe it was a disembodied spirit but you may interpret it differently. One other time I was napping beneath a mirror in a quiet room we rarely used when I awoke and felt an immense weight on top of my chest as if a child weighing 50 or more lbs was crouching on top of me. The energy around me was thick and negative and I immediately began to pray for help. A few seconds later it left as did the atmosphere in the room. I do believe that was something excessively dark. Many, many months later my boyfriend at the time were napping in the same place and I awoke to the same ominous, heavy feeling permeating the room when my boyfriend woke wild eyed and struggling to breathe, holding his chest. I began praying and casting and it again stopped but he was terrified and confused beyond words. I blessed and bound the mirror after that and never experienced anything in that room again so I don't believe it is specific to a state of sleep paralysis but is more likely just coincidental. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not. Sleep paralysis is a sleep disorder. During sleep paralysis you occur momentary inability to move your limbs, body and head despite being fully conscious. It is associated with passing between stages of wakefulness and sleep. The muscles during sleep paralysis act like during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when they are paralyzed, presumably to prevent the dreamer from physically acting out the dream. Therefore the sleep paralysis can be a sign that you are not passes smoothly from stage of wakefulness to sleep. The most common effects include visual hallucinations, such as shadows and light or a human or animal figure in the room, and auditory hallucinations, such as hearing voices or footsteps. A person often also feels pressure on his or her chest and has difficulty breathing. As well as visual hallucinations, sleep paralysis episodes may be accompanied by hallucinations of an auditory, olfactory and/or physical nature. Commonly reported hallucinations include doors opening, animals growling, approaching footsteps, scratching, internal buzzing/beeping, malevolent whispering as well as smells of rotting flesh, \u2018death\u2019, decay, damp, mould and feelings of being moved, drifting, rolling, floating, cold or heat. Sleep Paralysis in Other Cultures This is not a new condition. Sleep paralysis, under various guises, has existed in folklore from many different cultures for centuries - perhaps millennia. In Japan, they call it \"kanashibar\". In Newfoundland, it's known as \"the old hag\" who visits you in the night. In China, they know it as \"ghost oppression\". Even artists have depicted this ghoulish night-time disorder like The Nightmare by John Henry Fuseli. It's no surprise that native folklore shapes the nature of sleep paralysis hallucinations. In the US, it was only after flying saucers were popularized that people reported vivid alien abduction experiences, where aliens paralyzed and probed them in their beds at night. In Mexico, more than 90% of teenagers know the phrase \"a dead body climbed on top of me\" to describe the nightmare entity. And in African culture, it's known as \"the devil riding your back\" where demons have sex with people in their sleep. ",
