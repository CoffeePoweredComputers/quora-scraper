            "answer_text": "In general, belt drive turntables with a suspended subchassis provide better isolation than direct drive turntables that use plastic or rubber feet on their base instead. Sorbothane feet can also help decouple the turntable, sometimes with the addition of mass decoupling by way of a granite or corian sink cutout from a nearby kitchen counter shop. Personally, I\u2019d recommend investigating a shelf/platform cut to the size of the turntable base and screwed solidly with long brackets into the wall studs just behind that furniture surface; if done carefully, it can barely be noticed that it\u2019s \u201cfloating\u201d above the surface rather than touching it. This decouples the floor vibrations that are usually the worst culprits for feedback. One last point; always keep the dust cover closed (or removed) when playing a record, or the open lid can act as a bass trap and resonator, making the feedback problem much worse. At least this one\u2019s an easy fix! ",

            "answer_text": "Yea this is a tough one. If you listen mostly at low volume, some $30 studio monitor isolation pads would work, but higher volume with bass will make its way to the turntable. You could also add a similar pad under the turntable or invest in isolation feet for the table, but it\u2019s really hard to fully isolate the speakers when they\u2019re on the same structure as the turntable. If you have a small amount of floor space to the left and right of the structure the stereo is on, I\u2019d look into speaker stands if you haven\u2019t thought of it. Many of them have a small footprint. And then you can decouple the speakers from the stand by putting some monitor pads on top of the stand. It\u2019s necessary to isolate it further, just good for enhancing the overall sound and keeping vibrations from traveling down the speaker stand and into the floor and into the room below you. ",
