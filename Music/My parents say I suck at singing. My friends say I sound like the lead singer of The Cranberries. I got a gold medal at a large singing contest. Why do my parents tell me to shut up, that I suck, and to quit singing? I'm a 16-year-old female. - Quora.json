            "answer_text": "Please allow me to guess a bit here, based on my experience. I have won a couple of amateur singing contests, nothing big, and I used to get many comments from folks who felt I sounded better than most professionals. Now, about 27 years after I last actively sang, whether performing or being in a choir, my 12-year old son thinks I suck!\u2026 just hearing me singing around the house and in the car. Granted, the combination of heavy intake of spicy food, bourbon and frequently yelling at the computer screen (daily trading can do that to you!) has killed my falsetto, shrunk my comfort zone from more than 3 1/2 octaves to about 2+ and made my voice unexpectedly break up occasionally. Yet, I feel like I, generally, can still hold notes properly within my natural bass baritone range and am capable of using techniques to compensate for my now many shortcomings. So, why the harsh criticisms from my son, besides perhaps being in his phase of rebellious adolescence? My guesses are\u2026 My singing style ranges from big band, Broadway to some ballads, all of which Alex considers \u2018old, and no one listens\u2026\u2019 So, I suck because I sing in styles he dislikes. Similarly, The Cranberries\u2019 unique (at least when they first came out) compositional and vocal style may not be what your parents are used to. To them, you may simply sound offkey and odd.I sing around the kitchen and in the car, neither of which is acoustically complementary. Except for maybe soft, lyrical and contemplative ballads, most everyday environments aren\u2019t appropriate for real singing \u2014 the diaphragm pushing, big voice-type of singing. So, when you sing around the house and car, you can\u2019t really sing all out, and, on top of that, you don\u2019t have electronic echoes and amplification to make up for deficit.As much as my parents feel that I am a decent singer, they have never once encouraged me to pursue singing as a career. (I have always felt that I sing only for enjoyment anyway, so there\u2019s no conflict there.) Your parents may see your talent as a sideshow to your studies and later your \u2018normal\u2019 career! Not too many parents, especially non-musicians, would encourage their kids to pursue a less-structured career path such as in music or other arts. It is a hard and less predictable career path if you so choose it, so perhaps they are making a conscious effort to discourage you early on, whether they see your talent or not.So, what to do? May I suggest that you make sure your academic performance is up to your potential, alleviating your parents\u2019 potential objections. Then, you join a band or choir in school while keeping the hours of practice within your parents\u2019 mental limits, as a way to channel your musical creativity. Once you get into college, you can major in a more \u2018practical\u2019 field (computer, logistics, business\u2026) and minor in music and performing arts. This way, you can keep peace with your parents, get a degree you can fall back on, get a taste of multiple fields and then decide for yourself what you want to do with your life. The best IT manager I have ever met was a trained operatic soprano. Bette majored in music and minored in art history, and landed a job at an art museum, where she learnt a lot about computers. She later became a VP in an IT department in a major brokerage firm. All the while, she continued to train in her singing. (She was one of the two Classical music nuts I could talk to while I worked for the said brokerage firm.) It goes to show that you will never know where the adventure we called life may take you. As a person on his fourth career, I can attest to that. Keep your love of music alive within your heart. It might become your career, or it might not, but with music in your heart, you\u2019ll never be alone. Whether you have the talent or still need further training, you will figure it out and decide for yourself! (It does sound like you do, though.) No one else can or should do that for you! Best wishes to you! ",

            "answer_text": "any time a parent angers over the greatness of their child,, its simply Jelousy, or Distate within themselves, They dislike themselves so much, that anything good coming from their child must be garbage, never good enough, in their eyes, Or you are living the life they would have liked to live, and so they were told they could not 'have fun' and so they are stuck with that view on the world. Parents from the baby boom generation are Wild, its like its their goal to not let their children prosper in emotion strength, becuase then they will keep coming back to the parent requesting advice anout the world, and the thing is the world is no longer what it was when they were young, everything is vastly different opportunities were greater then, now one needs a specific gift to offer the world. to wow the boss or ppl around you. It comes down to how you want your life to be, realize you are parts of your parents, you are not them ! and need not carry out their wishes of you, they'll never really be happy with how you develop, because they hold unrealistic visions of who you are. Once you love yourself then you can be happy of how your family or friends succeeds, Can offer support to others, can find that positive life source when you only care for what you feel, or want in life. once ya remove the idea of measuring up to your parents ideals, the freedom fills your heart with hope and motivation to live fully as you are, ",
