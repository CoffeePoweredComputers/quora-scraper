            "answer_text": "Contrary to popular opinions, I think this song is underrated af! Most AROHAs will tell you they prefer All Night. Yes, All Night is one of their most iconic songs and the comeback that gave them their first win. But All Night and Always You are supposed to convey different feelings. Always You is a song where they are singing to their loved ones. The lyrics share a lingering passion and a desire to be with that person. All Night is a lot more playful and plays with the same idea of wanting to be with someone but without the sorrow that Always You shares.Always you conveys a lot of emotions: Love, pain, agony. It's a song that transmits pain and sorrow. It's not your happy, upbeat song, and therefore, many people who are not into this sort of music will not like it, hence why most people prefer their other more upbeat songs.This track showed a different side of Astro: a more serious and mature side. There is not that many fancy choreographies or aesthetics like in their other videos (it is still pretty aesthetic as in congruence with Astro style). I think that matches well the feelings they were trying to convey.Their voices perfectly matched the style of the song and showed up their vocal capabilities as well as the members showed they were capable of moving people emotionally with their performance. Yes, they have other slower emotional tracks, but none of them were released to be singles, and they were not promoted by Fantagio nearly enough. This comeback gave the members the possibility of showcasing how the member's voices can be able to share their emotions through their music.In Conclusion, I love this song. It\u2019s a really special song and should be appreciated for what it is :) ",

            "answer_text": "As an Aroha, I must say that this is my least favorite Astro title track. I fell in love with Astro\u2019s signature sound. It\u2019s a catchy melodic hook with minimal repetition in lyrics. This includes Cat\u2019s Eye, Confession, and Shadow. That\u2019s the reason why they are my favorite boy group and why I went to see them in concert in 2018. However, this song wasn\u2019t it. I\u2019m not a fan of EDM drop choruses to begin with. Certain ones work like Bomb Bomb by KARD, Miroh by Stray Kids or Violeta by IZ*ONEI remember how I listened to the song at least a dozen times and still didn\u2019t remember how the verses sounded. I thought that the song was boring. I have nothing against slower songs. In fact, Should\u2019ve Held On is my favorite Astro title track. I get how Always You is suppose to be a gift to Arohas, but it wasn\u2019t my style. Thankfully, All Night was much better but relied on the repetition of lyrics which isn\u2019t bad, but I still miss the catchy melodic hook. ",

            "answer_text": "I really like this song, though in my opinion all night is still better than always you. I feel the chorus is lacking and could have been better, it felt like jinjin and Rocky\u2019s raps were lacking in this song but moonbin singing the chorus was good. I got chills while listen to this song. It\u2019s and overall good song and flows fairly well. Sidenote: eunwoo is my baby and I love him very much. ",
