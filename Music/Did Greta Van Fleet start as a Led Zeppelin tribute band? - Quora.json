            "answer_text": "No. They came together through a mutual love of the Blues (unlike LZ; 2 members were Blues aficionados & 1 was more into Jazz & Motown), but they had other interests. Although sounding more redolent of Black Crowes, the only Led Zeppelin influences I can detect are the drum sound & the occasional \u2018yelps\u2019 from the singer. The guitarist is too cliche to be a Jimmy Page-clone (which is the essence of \u2018tribute bands\u2019 - although a musician must have their own identity). What I find a little disappointing is that Robert Plant praises them, saying \u2018They are Led Zeppelin ! (LZ\u2019s debut album)\u2019. Then again, if some young kids are reminiscing in your style, that\u2019s a good thing. ",

The orchestration and flow of their rendition is copied and pasted by Greta Van Fleet when they play \u201cStompin\u2019 All Down\u201dThat is all I can think of. So, I suppose, in the tradition sense of the word, No they are not a cover band, they are a band which, in the past, has covered Led Zeppelin songs. ",

However, that kid who\u2019s the lead singer sure sounds like the spittin\u2019 image of Robert Plant! No foolin\u2019! He\u2019s got Plant\u2019s vocals down!!! Robert Plant: The best vocalist in rock history! It\u2019s refreshing to see young millennials like this band revive the \u201960s and early \u201870s classic rock sound (with their own original material) which was the best ever in rock/pop history.
