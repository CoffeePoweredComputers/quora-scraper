            "answer_text": "I like this question \u2026 here goes. First, my runner up ... it's the tune I named as my vote-getter for the \u201cBest Beatles Song\u201d ... I called it \"The Most Beautiful Beatles Song\" in my opinion (Thomas J. Beaver's answer to What is the best Beatles song in your opinion? Do you have a story with it?). I forget the title ... something about a curvy street \u2026 There's a reason this was sort've the 'ultimate song' in the movie Yesterday last summer ... the 'tunewriting face-off' against Ed Sheeran song. It is beautifully crafted ... a little unique in that it starts right out with the first half of the chorus, really, which becomes the main tune ... the chorus finishes it off beautifully ... and the bridge is beautiful as well. It has a sad and nostalgia feel to it ... though the lyrics are actually hopeful. (the Yesterday movie clip \u2026 the songwriting showdown \u2026)  (here's the un-Spectorized Let It Be movie version)   My winner -- as the 'most musically perfect' (to me, meaning best-crafted) song -- was my \u2018official\u2019 first runner-up in the Best Song competition a couple days back. The 'most musically perfect': \"A Day In The Life,\" Sgt. Peppers ... This song approximates -- perhaps more than any other Beatles song -- a movement of a classical symphony or concerto ... where things are crafted musically like this: (i) opening theme ... (ii) second theme ...(iii) coda (bridge in song parlance) ... (iv) return to opening theme ... (v) climactic ending. And there are usually transitions between the sections. I'll go over how, in my opinion, \"A Day In The Life\" pretty well fits this model. Plus ... overlaid on this ... the whole song, to me, is a dream sequence really ... So ... going through it ... (i) The main tune (main theme) is haunting, in a 'day after the death' sort've way ... (and, Did You Know ... it's looking back {not at Paul but} at a guy The Beatles actually knew who'd died \u2026 the person who 'blew his mind out in a car' was the young man who Paul took his first LSD trip with, in later 1965, the young socialite Tara Browne, whose mother was a heiress to the Guiness stout {ale} fortune. John said about it: \"I was reading the paper one day and I noticed two stories. One was the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car. That was the main headline story. He died in London in a car crash.\" Browne, under the influence, was driving his Lotus over 105 mph, and ran right though a red light ... Browne had BTW thrown himself a birthday party in March 1966 that was attended by Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones.) Then John's transition ... 'I'd love to turrrrn youuuu onnnnn' ... launching the song and the listener into the cosmos with the soaring-yet-chaotic orchestration ... (ii) Then you have a breakthrough into the great second theme, by Paul... it's like when you think you're waking from the dream, getting up to start your 'real day' ... but you\u2019re not, you're just in a dream-within-a-dream ... for (in the first specific drug reference ever by McCartney - who also at the point had joined The Lads in taking LSD of course) we have the great-great (magical, really) little connecting bridge/transition \"Made my way upstairs and had a smoke ... And somebody spoke and I went into a dream\" ... (iii) ... then, as transition, the soaring coda of Lennon's-voice singing ahhhhhhhh \u2026 taking the song into an even-higher cosmic level ... (iv) Then a returning to the original tune/theme -- coming down from that cosmic high, but still in the original dream ... another little dream-episode \u2026 Then again John's transition 'I'd love to turrrrn youuuu onnnnn' ... launching you again into the cosmos with the soaring orchestration ... (v) And finally the climactic ending with the great 'final cosmic chord that never ends\u2019 ... into eternity. And, BTW, as far as this structure that the song 'hangs on', George Martin gets a lot of the \u2018arranging\u2019 credit ... tho \u2014 it should be noted \u2014 Paul and John sat down and blocked the composition out together \u2026 the tunes, the transitions (with a few \u2018holes\u2019 initially), were their idea. Its one of the great later-Beatles examples of Lennon/McCartney collaboration. And besides all this ... it's a cool and beautiful song! (here it is \u2026 cool visuals too)  ",

            "answer_text": "What makes a song perfect? I suppose if you can\u2019t think of any way to improve it and would not change a note. There are a lot of great Beatles songs that I would not tinker with, such that I can\u2019t imagine picking one as \u201cmost musically perfect.\u201d But since no one has chosen it, I would like to suggest Dear Prudence as a particularly great song on a musical level. Actually, it\u2019s unusual for a Lennon song because I find the main interest is in the music. The lyrics set out to do exactly what they intend, in a simple and childlike way. This song is perhaps unique in the Beatles canon in that it is a straight progression of increasing intensity from start to (almost) finish. Even more remarkably so, since, like a number of songs from the mid to later Beatles period (Rain, Tomorrow Never Knows, George\u2019s Indian-inspired songs), it is based mostly around a tonic drone note, with harmonies and lines that shift over and under that central note. It begins very gently (fading in from the jet-noise ending of Back In The USSR, the previous track on the White Album) with John playing in the finger picking guitar style he learned in India from Donovan. This intro gradually winds its way down to the start of the song proper, based around a chiming do-mi pattern which repeats almost constantly throughout. This is joined by a descending, partially chromatic line in the guitar, later joined by the bass (very similar to Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds). There are a few isolated percussion thumps here and there, with the drum kit (and bass - Paul is playing both) eventually entering together in full rhythm. Each line of the verse has one final bar that moves off of the tonic D to VIIb and IV, giving just enough harmonic variety so that we don\u2019t get sleepy. The second verse is enlivened by some high vocal harmonies that create a kind of halo around John\u2019s voice, along with Paul adding more motion to the bass line. This leads into the bridge section, which is also primarily based on the same tonic pedal but has a lot going on musically (with the simplest of lyrics: \u201cLook around\u201d). Guitar solo, polyphonic vocals, a different set of chords that lean more toward the major than the verse did, ending with the progression F-Ab (the tritone!)-G-D, all over the tonic D, and sung by a lowish male chorus. A very strange effect, a bit disturbing and very typical Lennon (see I Am The Walrus and Glass Onion). The third verse adds a new solo guitar commentary. Then, with the fourth and final verse, the heat starts to really get turned up. The drumming becomes louder and wilder (almost a bit sloppy), handclaps are added, an electric guitar counter melody becomes more and more prominent, high tremolos in the piano add to the shimmering quality, and then at the mid-point, we go into a half-time effect - the tune and harmonic rhythm are stretched to twice their previous length, but the overall tempo per beat actually gets slightly faster (an effect which is even more pronounced on John\u2019s Esher demo of the song), the backing vocals sustain an ecstatic chord, while the guitar plays a series of higher and higher phrases that reach to the climactic moment of the song. The effect is almost orgasmic. And having shot its wad, the song sinks down with a slight relaxation of tempo into the reflective guitar solo of the intro, so we end as gently as we began. Sort of a musical afterglow. This is a perfect song in that it takes seemingly simple, repetitive musical material and molds it into a grippingly unique structure, and it takes us on an emotional journey of a type we don\u2019t often experience in pop music. It\u2019s almost \u201cclassical,\u201d in that sense. The music has architecture and it reaches a strong goal. By the way, another pop songwriter who had a knack for achieving this sort of thing was Roy Orbison, whom Lennon admired very much. Songs like Running Scared and Pretty Woman also have this sense of emotional progression and reaching toward a climax. Stairway to Heaven might be a candidate for another musical descendant of this type of writing. ",
