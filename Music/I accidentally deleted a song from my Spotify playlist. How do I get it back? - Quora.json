            "answer_text": "You can do this very easily! Lots of people suggest looking in your recent play history (play queue \u2192 history) but if you haven't listened to it in a while then it won't be there. Before 2015 Spotify used to have a \u2018ctrl+z' feature where you could undo the last change you made to your library, and they removed it\u2014 and by popular demand and lots of moaning, they brought it back. So on the Windows desktop app (not on Spotify Online) (not sure about iOS, sorry), look for the three dots in the top left corner of the app.  Click on that, and hover over the \u2018edit\u2019 option.  And right there is the undo button! You can also still use the keyboard shortcut, but sometimes it lags and doesn\u2019t register if your RAM gets quickly filled like it does on my computer.  And voila! The old favourite you just deleted (or even the playlist you just erased altogether! I tried this and can confirm it works) is back on your playlist/in your library. :) Hope that helped! \u2764\ufe0e\ufe0e ",
