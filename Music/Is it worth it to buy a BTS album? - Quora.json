            "answer_text": "First, this depends on your budget. Can you or you can\u2019t? Being a fan will cause you something of course, Whether it\u2019s album or other merch. Are you willing to buy them? Or maybe you have other things to do with the money you have. It\u2019s totally fine. Second, is it really necessary. Being a fan can\u2019t be measured if you have their album or not right? Cause like me, I haven\u2019t bought any of their album but I know all of their songs, I listen to them, I have them on my phone. In my case, since I\u2019m really working and earning for things that I wanted in the future, I\u2019m saving money for more valuable stuff. Concerts. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m a more practical fan. Third, do what makes you happy but you should not regret it. Haha. Of course if you choose buying an album and then regret it afterwards if ever you saw a more valuable item or merch to buy. So, double check it properly if you really want to buy. Whether you buy them or not, it will not change the fact that you\u2019re still their fan, and they will still appreciate you. Also, in these generation all songs can be downloaded now. ",

            "answer_text": "Content and quality wise, you will have contents not available online: photobook, photocards, posters ect. In my country most ARMY can\u2019t buy because a BTS album cost 4\u20135 times the price of a local one and the shipping rates made everybody faint. We have been discussing about streaming on apple music but some weren\u2019t able to afford the $5basic plan. To put it into perspective one BTS album plus shipping costs 1/9 of the basic monthly salary So for these fans watching on YouTube (because spotify is blocked) is the only alternative because buying a BTS content isn\u2019t worth it. If you can buy and want the feeling of touching a photobook, the smell of new pages, have a poster around and hidden songs then buy it. . Suga used to make unboxing videos on bangtantv so you can check their former albums and see ",
