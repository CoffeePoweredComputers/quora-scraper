Another James Brown band member, Phelps \u201cCatfish\u201d Collins, brother of Bootsy is superb with both the JBs and Parliament.  The Boss with James Nolen Also keeping it in the family was Joseph \"Nin-Nin\" Reinhardt, the younger brother of the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt and played rhythm behind his brother on the classic 1930s recordings Quintette du Hot Club de France.
