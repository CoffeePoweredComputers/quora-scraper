            "answer_text": "A great community to help you find the name of a song is WatZatSong Let the community name your tunes! (Disclosure: I\u2019m WatZatSong cofounder). I have to admit we didn\u2019t believe there would be people able to name thousands of songs to help some other members when we started it but the members keep impressing us, with some having named above 10k so far and more than half a million songs have been named to date. Shazam is clearly faster, but when Shazam fails or when you have no recording and only a tune that you can sing or hum, the WatZatSong community is often the way to go. ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to be tough. If you only heard the song and didn\u2019t see the video, even a few words of what you remember should help you narrow down your search tremendously. If you saw/remember the video try sharing what visuals you remember. However, just based off what you wrote, I\u2019m hazarding a guess that you must\u2019ve listened to Careless Whisper by George Michael.  Is this the song? ",
