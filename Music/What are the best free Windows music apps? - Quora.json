            "answer_text": "I have an Xbox Music Pass, so Xbox Music works just fine for me. It allows me to seamlessly listen to the following without interruptions or manual intervention (if my Now Playing contains any combination of the following):1. Anything in the Music folder of my phone's onboard storage.2. Anything in the Music folder of my SD card.3. ANY mp3 in my OneDrive Music folder in the cloud.4. Doggone near anything in the Music Store. What's more, I can set it so that everything on my desktop, laptop, tablet and phone sync in very near real time. I just have to log into each respective Xbox Music app with the same user credentials (as you would expect). And that sync isn't physical files (unless I want them to be); it'll stream whatever isn't on a particular device when I want to play it there. I also use JazzRadio.com (the app) when I need to get my jazz fix. ;) Surprisingly, Pandora rarely gets any play on my devices. Spotify simply does not. Other's I've downloaded on my Windows Phone but haven't done much with yet are (in no particular order):1.  Music Sense2. MUSIC+3. OneMusic4. QuickPlay Pro For audiobooks I use:1. Digital Audio Book2. Audible ",

            "answer_text": "Voicemeeter would be one of the best free music software option for windows. It is an audio mixing donationware, developed by VB-Audio software that can be used to mix and manage audio streams from multiple sources. It offers 3 output and 3 input streams (all virtual) to enable the user to mix audio through multiple buses. It comes with an in-built Audio I/O which allows the user to operate Voicemeeter as their primary audio device, similar to an actual hardware mixer. It supports multiple audio interfaces like MME, WASAPI and WaveRT. ",
