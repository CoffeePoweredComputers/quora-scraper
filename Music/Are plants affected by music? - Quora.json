            "answer_text": "Yes they do, plants respond to music as proven by several controlled experiments. In the International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, Vol. 5, No. 5, October 2014 it was reported after controlled experiments with rose plants' response to music vs silence that:  Sound is known to affect the growth of plants [1]. Studies have also shown that sound vibration can be used to stimulate a seed or plant [2]. Previous studies indicate that musical sound has a significant effect on the number of seeds sprouted compared to noise and untreated control and sound vibrations directly affect living biologic systems [1]. Foliage planted along freeways to reduce noise pollution often grows differently than foliage planter in a quiet environment [3], [4]. It would be advantageous for plants to learn about the surrounding environment using sound, as acoustic signals propagate rapidly and detection of sound may have adaptive value in plants [5]. Plants are complex multicellular organ-isms considered as sensitive as humans for initial assaying of effects and testing new therapies [6]-[8].  Several studies have been undertaken to study and understand the influence of sound and music on plants and plant growth. It has been reported that under optimal stimulation conditions (100dB and 800Hz) the sound field can enhance the growth of Chrysanthemum callus and moderate stress stimulation can enhance the assimilation of tissues or cells, improve their physiological activity and accelerate the growth of plants [9]. Other studies show that under suitable sound stimulation, the growth of Chrysanthemum roots could be accelerated and the sound stimulation could enhance the metabolism of roots and the growth [10].

            "answer_text": "There are few research studies  \"Dr. Singh, head of Botany at Annamalai University in India studied plants reactions to Classical and Rock music. While listening to Classical and Baroque music, the plants grew 72% more leaves and they grew 20% faster. The plants which were exposed to Rock music grew abnormally tall and died in 2 weeks. The plants which were exposed to Classical and Baroque music ended up leaning towards the speakers instead of the light and the closest plants began to wrap themselves around the speakers.\" A California State Science Fair project deduced from tests that \"Silence grew the best and healthiest followed by spoken word (Harry Potter). Classical Music (Vivaldi Concertos) ended up just under spoken word. Bringing up the rear was a very small and unhealthy plant that was 'listening' to heavy metal and (harsh) world music (Mudvayne and Rammstein).\"... A Wingate University botanist states, \"As you probably know, sound is a wave, and more specifically, a pulse wave. This simply means that it is formed by areas of higher and lower pressure in the atmosphere through which it travels. Terms such as \"amplitude,\" when used in reference to sound, are actually referring to the plot of the air pressure versus time on a graph. Now, it is difficult to believe that such (extremely small) fluctuations in air pressure could have any effect on a plant's growth. There is very little difference, to a plant, in music and ambient noise. \"However, you might want to consider this question from another perspective. It is possible that in an experiment, plants which are exposed to music may grow more than plants that are not. Why? Because even though it is unlikely that the plants themselves respond to the music, their caretakers do! Maybe the plants which are exposed to music receive better care than those which do not. Might be worth looking into!\" According to the Plant Physiology Information Website, \"...Plants have no ears to hear and no brain to process or develop musical taste or music appreciation...so any attempts to show relationships between music forms and growth or other responses have met with total failure in the hands of true scientists.\"--------------------------------------\u2026 http://www.ehow.com/facts_5485813_classi\u2026 ",

They played different types of music and studied different plants, for which type of music got the most positive reaction from the plants, then ranked them. There were about 15 different category\u2019s of music ranging from death metal to classical. I only remember the number one, and three. One was Jazz, I remembered that because I found it surprising. Then number three was punk rock, I remember that because my plants hear it a lot by proxy. What I found odd was that similar sounding types of music weren't very close to each other on the list, some were, but others like punk rock and heavy metal were fairly far apart. It could have been a specific instrument maybe that the plants weren't turned on by, or maybe one that they were. Or it could have been that this whole idea was a bunch of BS. I would give it a shot if thats what your looking to do. For what its worth, none of the plants responded negatively to any type of music. Good luck. ",

Here are the results :-  As we can see, positive vibrations of words, crystalizes the water and negative disintegrates the structure of molecules. Crystals are said to be the perfect form of solids because they are well arranged in a systematic manner. Emoto though his work in pseudoscience represents that this so called good water can increase metabolism and maintain proper health of body while the negative thoughts water can also reduce the latter. So if we play melodious music, the trees are supposed to grow faster and healthier. There are various mantras from agnihotra farming which are chanted during planting a crop or during morning and evening which inhibits faster growth cycle in plants by positive wave sounds. This experiment is also performed by Om Shree Dham in Australia.  The hymns need not be Sanskrit, it can be melodious ones too but, from the picture in first one we can see that prayer has much larger impact than all others so, religious hymns of any kind can accelerate the growth in plants.

For baroque music, it affects the ripening process of a plants. How does this happen? Sound is transmitted in the form of waves that travel through a medium, such as air or water. The waves cause the particles in this medium to vibrate. When you switch on your radio, the sound waves create vibrations in the air that cause your ear drum to vibrate. This pressure energy is converted into electrical energy for the brain to translate into what you understand as musical sounds. In a similar manner, the pressure from sound waves create vibrations that could be picked up by plants. Plants would not \"hear\" the music, they would feel the vibrations of the sound wave.
