            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a few I can think of: MamamooThey\u2019re known for their very powerful vocals and their earlier songs tended to have a jazzy vibe to it. They have a pretty solid fanbase in Korea and are considered one of the top groups. I think they\u2019re not as big internationally because they promote more domestically and didnt really market much internationally until more recently. I think another factor is possibly because none of the members speak English fluently so it\u2019s harder to reach international audiences. But I do think they\u2019re growing.   \u2014 BTOB Similar to Mamamoo where they are a group with very strong vocals. The guys perform like angles on stage but offstage, they\u2019re absolute memes. They had a slow rise to the top, I believe they\u2019re currently the 2nd longest boy group to receive a music show win. But they now have a pretty good fanbase in Korea and are not only loved by Kpop fans, but also the general public. Again, they\u2019re a group that seems to focus more on domestic promotions rather than international. Since they\u2019re doing well domestically, I don\u2019t think the company really planned to put them out internationally.  *im putting in the live version of \u201cmissing you\u201d because they incorporated sign language in to their choreography and it need to be appreciated  __Gfriend They\u2019re the nation\u2019s Girlfriends. They were known for their powerful but innocent concept, strong vocals, and synchronized dances. They\u2019re pretty big in Korea and have swept music show wins on many occasions. I think the reason why they\u2019re not talk about much internationally is because their cuter concept seems to suit the Asian market more and doesn\u2019t appeal to the west very much. But they seem to be growing and now that they\u2019re company is a sublable of Big Hit, it may mean Big Hit can possibly help them market internationally more. Personally they\u2019re one of my favorites.   ",

It\u2019s impossible to estimate how much Koreans love them! Their songs consistently rank at the top of the charts. Lots of foreigners coming to Korea say that BTOB merch is literally everywhere. unfortunately, their fame ends in South Korea. I don\u2019t know any western kpop fan that stand this group. ",
