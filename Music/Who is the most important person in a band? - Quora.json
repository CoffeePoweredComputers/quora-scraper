            "answer_text": "Not a romantic notion exactly, but my experience shows it\u2019s the member with a vision of what the band intends to achieve. You hear the term, \u201cshared vision\u201d sometimes\u2026.when you have it, you will be pulling together. I do believe a leader/administrator is necessary for lasting success. Leadership may not even be named, may be reluctant or even accidental, but is absolutely a requirement. It\u2019s a sobering political reality, but a direction and goals are important parts of any banded ensemble. Often these goals are esoteric and unfocused, but at least present a path. Players are generally equal in my view, if they are all competent at their jobs. If a certain band member is so enormously talented as to overshadow the other players, the concept of a band is in jeopardy from the get go, unless the vision is to be a backup band for this individual. We\u2019re dealing with egos here, and it\u2019s not easy to do and it\u2019s harder to maintain, but it\u2019s how successful outfits manage to stay together. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the band in question. In some bands, pretty much everything depends on one person. They write the music, play it, sing, etc. And even if they don\u2019t necessarily write every part, they\u2019ve got the \u201cdrive\u201d or \u201cvision\u201d to create the material, get gigs, build an audience, etc. But in some bands things are more more collaborative, with various duties spread over more than one person, and the band can\u2019t do what it does with any members replaced.
