            "answer_text": "Forever Young by Alphaville is about the Cold War, primarily about the Cold War in the 1980\u2019s. It is about living with and growing up with the possibility of nuclear annihilation at any moment. \u201cLet\u2019s dance in style, let\u2019s dance for awhile. Heaven can wait, we\u2019re only watching the skies. Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. Are you going to drop the bomb or not?\u201d It is about living your life to the fullest and making the most of every moment you have, because it can be taken away without warning and that you have no control over it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the power but we never say never. Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip. The music\u2019s for the sad man\u201d \u201cCan you imagine when this race is won. Turn our golden faces into the sun.\u201d is in reference to the arms race, and if anyone were to win the race, everyone would lose. We would turn to face the nuclear fireballs over all the major cities and be incinerated in the process. It is a critique of the leaders of the USA and the USSR (At the time, primarily Ronald Reagan and Chernenko/Andropov. Gorbachev was more willing to de-escalate tensions). This is referenced in the \u201cPraising our leaders, we\u2019re getting in tune. The music\u2019s played by the, the mad men.\u201d The meaning is that while we, as the youth and citizens of the respective countries are doing what our leaders tell us, we know they are insane and liable to do anything. \u201cSome are like water, some are like the heat. Some are a melody and some are the beat. Sooner or later, they will all be gone. Why don\u2019t they stay young?\u201d refers to the fact that even though we are all different, the citizens of the USSR, the USA and all the proxy countries, all are different; different cultures, ideas, ideals, experiences; we are all in this together and will all die together. We will all be gone in a nuclear fireball. \u201cSo many adventures couldn\u2019t happen today. So many songs we forgot to play. So many dreams swinging out of the blue. We let them come true.\u201d After everyone has been annihilated, all the children that did not get to live would never have their adventures. Would never hear their music or achieve their dreams. We let the mad men\u2019s dreams come true. Do you really want to live forever? Carpe Diem. Seize the day. ",
