            "answer_text": "Although it is not a popular as many people think, as Lyonel correctly pointed out, there is a higher acceptance for the genre than most other countries. Artists enjoy a lot of support from the government in the form of grants to help out with touring, for example. There is also a lot of support for events and the genre is seen as part of Norwegian culture. The 2015 edition of Blastfest, an annual festival held in Bergen, was opened by the mayor of Bergen.  (Photo credit: This Way To Heavy) The idea of seeing an elected official giving a speech in front of a backdrop that says Rotting Christ (a Greek Black Metal band) is absurd to many outside of Norway, or indeed the Nordic countries.  During the 2014 bicentenary celebrations of the Norwegian constitution (1814), Enslaved and Wardruna were commissioned to create a composition that celebrates Norwegian history. The result is Skuggsj\u00e1 (meaning Mirror in Old Norse), which was performed in a festival called Eidsivablot on September 14th, 2014 in Eidsvoll, the town where the constitution was signed on the 17th of May, 1814.   As you can see at the bottom of the poster, this was supported by the Eidsvoll and Akershus councils, as well as the organisation that oversaw the jubileum celebrations, Ja Vi Elsker (the name is taken from the national anthem). Just this week on Thursday (17th March, 2016), and for the whole weekend, the Skuggsj\u00e1 show was brought to London as part of Enslaved's 25th anniversary as a band, in a festival they dubbed ByNorse. The members of Enslaved and Wardruna were received by the ambassador to Norway in London.  (Photo credit: ByNorse Facebook page) So although you won't see hordes of black clad people in corpse paint roaming the streets of Oslo or Bergen, the genre is still very well respected in Norway. ",

            "answer_text": "Black Metal is not popular in Norway. It's  not widespread there. It's the birth land of Black Metal. Mayhem, was the first official Black Metal Band, even before that Bathory (forefathers of Black Metal) are from the Scandinavia only. The way we often think that Black metal is popular in Norway, similarly it is popular in parts of Germany,South America, Poland, and many other places of the Earth where we can find Black metal colonies (couple of black metal bands and fans trying to grow and maintain an atmosphere favorable to black metal) but that's it. It's Just some colonies-it's never the music for the masses. Moreover, many of the popular bands ( no name mentioned) who have been in the circuit for some years and has recognition, records, labels have already drifted from the old school black metal to melodic, symphonic and a modified( diluted) version of black metal which is easier to listen to and hence made the show off easier attracting more and more people to follow them and claiming themselves as Black metal Fans. Fact still remains-it is not popular, because, it originated as the language of expression for the 'misfits' and 'left-out' s of population and society;and it remains to be that.Black metal has always revolved around topics and themes that was rather kept hidden and under closure (black arts, satanism, the lacking of Christianity,religion,God, about carnal desires, revenge) and marked as negative. By definition, it was never meant to be popular. So, it isn't. We sometimes assume it is. ",
