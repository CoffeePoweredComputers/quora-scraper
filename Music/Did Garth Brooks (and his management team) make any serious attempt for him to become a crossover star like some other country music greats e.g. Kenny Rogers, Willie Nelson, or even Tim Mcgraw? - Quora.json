            "answer_text": "Some good answers here, but a quick history lesson is in order. Kenney Rogers started out hitting it big as a rocker. Even then, there were elements of country on his records with The First Edition, and he went solo more on the country side. Willie is a songwriter first and foremost, and to my mind he's just Willie. An awful lot of his songs aren't country at all. He writes what he writes. What about Tim McGraw? Other than being a talented country star, part time actor and son of one of my favorite authors, his company didn't do much to get him crossed over. Outside of the 2004 cut with Nelly and a brief dalliance with Def Leopard, the only reason he ended up charting outside of country was simply good taste by the listeners. Not bad for an Irish Italian American mutt. Side note: The Eagles. Rock or Country? Back in the day, rock and country rock. In 2020, country. They crossed over and didn't do a thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you define as a crossover star. By all measure he has succeeded as a Crossover Entertainer. His music sales, concert attendance figures, and TV success proves he has been wildly successful. The Charts seem to be more segregated by genre so that really is no longer a measure of crossover success. Let us face it, to get the numbers he\u2019s getting many buyers from other genres are purchasing his music even if he is not on the other charts. They did attempt a strange cross over attempt with his Chris Gaines persona but that while successful, it was weird in so many ways. ",
