            "answer_text": "I know many people are going to come for me but this is my opinion. I personally think she is not that nice. Let me explain\u2026 In 2015, she went to a doughnut shop and licked the doughnut without paying for it and said she \u2018hated america\u2019. She was caught doing this on camera but she later apologised. It doesn\u2019t stop there. *Please Scroll to the bottom of the post before y'all comment about the donut scandal* In 2018, Kris Wu\u2019s album debuted 1st on Billboard 100, passing Ariana\u2019s Thank, U next. Her fans started rumours saying that he used bots and someone later contacted Ariana\u2019s manager. He posted a tweet saying :  Then, posted:  For those people who don't know who Kris Wu is, he was a former member of EXO. He has collaborated with famous western artists such as Travis Scott,(their song called \u2018Deserve\u2019) Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, (song called Freedom) Rich the Kid, (Coupe) Trippie Redd, (18) and with Canadian record producer, Murda Beatz on their collab, Novermber Rain. Kris Wu is Burberry\u2019s first Chinese ambassador in 2017 and Louis Vuitton\u2019s ambassador in 2018. Her fans started calling him out and one fan called Kris Wu \u201cugly yellow sushi roll\u201d. This offended many Asian people including non-Kris Wu fans and Kris Wu fans. This is the 21st century and racism is not supported. Ari didn\u2019t apologise to him. Ari even liked the tweet. This is why I have stopped supporting her even though I still listen to her songs. Yes, she is the one of the most famous and best singers in the world, she should\u2019ve apologised to Kris on behalf of her fans. Ariana needs to stop thinking she is the best and that she will forever be the 1st and all this fame has gone to her head. Ariana\u2019s fan base is really toxic and too rude. Edit: I never expected this much views and upvotes!! Edit 2: Before anyone comments about the whole 'donut scandal' please know that someone has already explained that she was heavy on anesthesia. I know that some people might not like her for doing this and I can't say anything on that. I understand why people were upset and annoyed at her for this but she was simply not herself. Edit 3: Thank you for 1.1k upvotes lmao \u2764\ufe0f Edit 4: tysm for all the people who has either shared or upvoted this. this means a lot to me, especially since this is my most viewed answer \ud83d\udc95 sylvia ~ \ud83d\ude0c\ud83e\udd8b ",

            "answer_text": "i mean, there\u2019s no certain answer if anybody is bad or good. especially a celebrity. as a fan, of course i\u2019ll say she\u2019s good but if she\u2019s not your type, you probably wouldn\u2019t. somebody can\u2019t be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, it just depends on your interpretation. i find her nice since she\u2019s shown kindness and compassion many times, even when she was going through a lot. 15k dollars to a fan to pay for college. saying she loves her fans everyday on twitter. paying for fans\u2019 meals many times. one love manchester. she\u2019s done many things with good intentions several times and is dedicated to her fans which makes me love and support her. however, that doesn\u2019t define her as a person. she\u2019s a celebrity so many people know and form an opinion on her. i\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right to make disrespectful comments judging her because all celebrities are human beings like us and you don\u2019t have a right to insult them any more than another person. but people like her are prone to controversy so you\u2019ll see several viewpoints on her. none of us know her personally so ultimately we can\u2019t judge her 100%. what i\u2019d suggest is finding out on your own. there\u2019s people that like her and people that don\u2019t. watch her interviews, listen to her songs, check her social medias. we all have different types of people that we prefer which shapes our opinions. so if you want an answer to this question, decide what YOU think of her :) ",
