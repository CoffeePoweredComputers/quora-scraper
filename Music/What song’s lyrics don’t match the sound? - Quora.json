            "answer_text": "One song that comes to mind is a little ditty called \u201cHiding Out\u201d by Pete Townshend from his album White City. The tune is very jaunty and upbeat, but the lyrics are pitch black and reflect a sense of deep isolationism: From my window, I see roadsThey lead to darkness, leading homeAnd in the midnight of a soul's unsleepingI hear the waterfall of women weepingHear the distant noise of traffic stallingI hear the prostituted children calling, calling out Grim lyrical imagery of a run down, faded town in Britain accompanied by a happy, poppy tune; quite different than most of Pete Townshend\u2019s work.

            "answer_text": "All Those Years Ago by George Harrison. Apparently, George had already written the tune and different lyrics for Ringo to go on his next album. I can hear Ringo singing this tune, its nice and bouncy and quite jolly, if somewhat lightweight. When John Lennon was murdered, George took the song back and wrote some lyrics about John and how he was killed by \u201cone of the Devil\u2019s best friends\u201d and how they treated John \u201clike a dog\u201d etc etc . . .and he put it to this bouncy cheerful song! Remarkable. Could he really not have written a new tune or even used another one from a song he was writing? I really like much of George\u2019s solo work but even now, nearly 40 years later I still cringe at this one. ",
