            "answer_text": "By far, by far, by far, Paul McCartney was the better lead guitar player, and there\u2019s a lot of evidence to support this. The original instrumentation of The Beatles from their Silver Beetles/Johnny & The Moondogs/Hamburg-era incarnations was always three guitar players: John, George and Paul. When they booked gigs, often without the benefit of the drummer (the Beatles blew up drummers more often than Spinal Tap), they\u2019d tell club owners reluctant to book them, \u201cThe rhythm\u2019s in the guitars!\u201d Once Stu Sutcliff (a terrible player but a close pal of John\u2019s) exited the group, Paul was the natural choice to move over to bass because he had the most musical skill all around\u2014and George certainly didn\u2019t want to take over. The compromise was simple: the second best lead guitarist in the group assumed that role in exchange for the best lead guitarist on bass. Along with Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones and John Entwistle of the Who, McCartney redefined what a bass player in rock music could be\u2014a first-class melody man with bass-drum power in his pick. John Lennon, even in his time of life where he hated just about everything Paul stood for, conceded, \u201cPaul is one of the most innovative bass players ever.\u201d George\u2019s style was certainly interesting, but hardly innovative and mostly reflected influences typical of the time: Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, Scotty Moore and \u201950s instrumental rock, including \u201cRaunchy,\u201d which landed him a spot in the group. But soon, his limitations as a guitar player became apparent. As he was unable to play the complex solo triplet on \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d engineer Norman Smith had to pitch the tape to half speed and have the riff doubled by a piano. In later live versions recorded at the BBC, that solo snippet is dubbed in from the album. At the time, George certainly deserved credit for popularizing the Rickenbacker 12-string guitar, but it was not an instrument he sought out so much as gifted to him by Francis Hall of Rickenbacker. Actually, it was offered to John first\u2014John decided George might be better suited to play it. From about that time on, Beatles fans saw hints that Paul might indeed have better lead guitar skills. On George\u2019s \u201cThink for Yourself,\u201d Paul\u2019s fuzz bass dominates the song as a fairly nasty-sounding subsonic lead guitar. The lead work on \u201cAnother Girl,\u201d from \u201cHelp!\u201d is likewise Paul at the helm, demonstrating an ability to negotiate the fretboard in ways George did not or could not. But it\u2019s \u201cTaxman\u201d where McCartney busts out of the gate. Engineer Geoff Emerick relates how Harrison\u2014not out of perfectionism but limitation\u2014simply couldn\u2019t nail down a solo to match his acidic commentary on the British tax system. McCartney\u2019s work is stunning: A D-key raga utilizing the open D string against fretted notes, and movement up and down the neck, with rapid note decorations that made it stand out. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014George was a good and solid lead guitarist. But playing the instrument slowly and somewhat conventionally, he wasn\u2019t near Paul\u2019s equal. The \u201cGood Morning, Good Morning\u201d solo (a Fender Esquire through a Selmer amp) is Paul\u2019s handiwork. Is there anything even close to it on \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d? He also played the lead guitar on the opening \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d cut as well, complete with flick-of-the-wrist riffing (not at all a characteristic of George\u2019s playing\u2014thanks to Quora community member Dan Rosenberg for helping me nail this detail). Paul\u2019s virtuoso performances on guitar also include \u201cBlackbird,\u201d and in his solo career with Wings, it\u2019s hard to imagine George doing the angular, leather-and-dagger solo Paul does to close out \u201cHelen Wheels.\u201d I know as a lead guitar player, I spent quite a long time trying to learn it\u2014it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. George did of course innovate once he learned slide guitar, and just because he\u2019s slow didn\u2019t mean he was sleepy. \u201cSomething,\u201d \u201cDrive My Car,\u201d \u201cI Saw Her Standing There,\u201d \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d and the beautiful, chiming C major to A descent on \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d all argue for respecting him as a player (that last specimen, by the way, a neat reworking of the guitar Harrison added to Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cBadge\u201d). But Paul? He could rock the drums, piano, bass and guitar in a way that presaged him being a one-man band towards the end of The Beatles and the years after. Yes, as a lead guitarist he had his mawkish moments, especially on \u201cMcCartney\u201d \u2026 then again, what could top his melody-line work on \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\u201d? I can\u2019t help thinking there are many others out there like me who in our love of The Beatles craft, studied McCartney much closer than Harrison. In my pantheon of Top 10 guitarists who influenced my style, he\u2019s definitely up there. The solos of George Harrison are certainly effective, catchy even. But they are what they are. Many of McCartney\u2019s solos, by contrast, shimmer with occluded layers I\u2019m still trying to unearth. ",

            "answer_text": "actually a strange question, partly paul didn t play a lot of guitar in the beatles per se. however, paul mccartney was an excellent guitarist, and a phenomenal bassist, yet when he played guitar, note his acoustic on yesterday and blackbird, or even,follow the sun. incredible and adept acoustic playing. perhaps,even somewhat complicated, in his execution. i think george wouldn t of played it better, if he played it, yet that would of been a simpler , sturdy , even rhythmn. if you are talking lead. note\u2026as far as i read, george couldn t get the solo right on taxman, so paul played the solo. and the solo is impressive[paul also played the riff very well]. impressive to the point, that it could of been a really good,exciting solo by george. he may have done this solo and also, the solo on the song srgnt pepper. his lead guitar was exciting and vibrant, and sometimes skilled. yet i think when he played lead, he may not have tried that hard, just pulled off something cool. i think both excellent guitarists, and when mccartney played guitar, i wouldn t say george was necessarily better. however, since george developed his leads, his solos. and he had his own style and trademark, george inevitably was shown as a better lead player. however, paul had the raw materials to be just as good. george was a conservative , yet very clever lead player, and expressed and heightened and enhanced a song , usually thru his subtlty , skill, and cleverness.usually somewhat simple, but that doesn t matter, that shows remarkable patience and guitar cleverness to get it simple and stunning. since paul was so adept at bass and acostic guitar, and played some solid,flashy and exciting solos, he may have had the raw skills to be just as good a lead player as geroge, but this was never proven, since he didn t play lead guitar that often. apparently, i read that george played the guitars and bass also, on she said she said. so george could cover bass well, also. which would make sense. since george developed such an interesting, cool guitar style, and was also skilled and adept. the nos of memorable leads along w solos, would then place him above paul as a better guitarist, for sure. george had an original guitar style, that could also have an interesting country twang, a sweet chuck berry sound, a strong rock riff sound, and very sweet subtle leads even in a song like she loves you. his solos on something or his riff on ticket to ride, or his riff on and i love her[simple yet elegant, which paul loved], or his leads on he said she said, and your bird can sing, if i needed someone, or early fifties type leads, solos, on don t bother me, with that classic reverb sound, and also tremolo. in the end george harrison was a master at guitar. despite not having the flash of eric clapton, i think he was just as good as eric clapton. and george should go down as one of the best lead players, and one of the most influential.
