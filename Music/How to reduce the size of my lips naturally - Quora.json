            "answer_text": "To all those people who have big,fat or hanging lower lips\u2026here are my best possible ways to reduce it If you have bigger upper teeth, then that\u2019s the only reason for that giant lips which pushes your lower lip ..so better consult it with a dentistReducing body fat \u2026this will bring in a big difference..if you are obese .then try to burn your fat as soon as possible to get rid of this problem !! I personally did this, And yeah it gave me stunning results !Last and traditional way to reduce your lips size is to apply the juice of ginger on the lips as it contain pantothenic acid.. which helps to extract or loosen your lips which eventually becomes smaller in size .Try to pout if u have a wide large lips ! Your lip skin contracts ! This is a long process, cannot expect quick results .If nothing works! take your own risk in doing cosmetic surgery ! There are some weird case where their lips go even worse than before . So i suggest only if you think your lips looks so big and that makes you feel uncomfortable when people ask or if it discourage your confidence then go ahead to fix it with a cosmetic surgeon !!",
