That song is a curse. And I carried it for years, until I heard, \u201cIt\u2019s My Party and I\u2019ll Cry if I Want to\u201d, cry if I want to, cry if I want to \u2026. But that song did eradicate \u201cSmall World\u201d from my brain. However, I\u2019ve found that \u201cSmall World\u201d had taken its toll on my brain. It was much bigger before the Disneyland trip. But I figured if \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d could send \u201cSmall World\u201d scampering, there must be other songs that will put me right. What I do now is pick an emergency \u201cunstick song and I have it always available. I don\u2019t know of any other way to infiltrate and conquer the stuck sound. Overriding it is the only solution I\u2019ve found ",

Many years before that, I was in a car being driven to Yankee Stadium, when Eight Days a Week came on, it drove me CRAZY. I absolutely loved it. From what I understand, many areas of the brain,( forum doctors correct me if I\u2019m mistaken please) the hyppocampus, amygdila, glands releasing certain endorphins, are involved. Perhaps it depends on the song itself, or the state of mind as one was listening. If I dont like the tune, I bang myself on the head screaming, STOP IT STOP IT I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. If I like the tune, then full steam ahead, let it ride. Maybe its the hook. From your question, it appears you don\u2019t like the song, as you want to get over it. Like unrequited love, it will take some time. Of course it doesnt help matters if its a song currently on the air, and cant be avoided. All I can say is time heals. ",

Could be the lyrics that hook you, but if it\u2019s the melody maybe it has something to do with your current mood. Could also be id its a popular song that you hear from almost everywhere it has higher chance of retaining in your head. Try listening to other music or do something to get your head out of it, like running, exercise, art or studying. In rare cases you could be in a trance. In Islam they prohibit music you know why? Dunno if you believe or not but some music induce black magic/behavioral suggestions. You know why they charm snakes by music? How certain old rituals were aided by music? Also how some people see effects in meditation music and binaural beats? Could be scary yeah but rare music are like this just be careful what you listen to. ",

Which for some reason, you are tricking your brain to stop thinking about it that it ends there. Whenever you can, try to avoid anything that triggers you to remember that catchy song. Listen to other old music that you like that reminds you of other things (take a nostalgia trip), use it as a distraction to that catchy song. You'll get over it! Good luck, and I hope it helps! ~Eman ",
