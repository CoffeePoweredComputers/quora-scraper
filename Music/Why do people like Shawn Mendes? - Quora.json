            "answer_text": "he\u2019s the sweetest 19 year old ever!! go watch \u2018Nat time\u2019 on YouTube and her videos on shawn. Shawn loves his fans. Unlike many celebrities, he stops and takes pictures with them. I\u2019ve met him on 2 occasions briefly. At the airport, around 400\u2013500 people easily. All waiting for one guy. We were all singing passionately and with our hearts out, our voices ready to screaming and arms ready to snuggle with the dude. We were all in love with the same guy. He had the body, face, looks and talent. He IS actually talented. I wOULD show you a video from the concert but I can\u2019t put on videos here. There were 5k crazy fans in one place and dare I say, there was enough love there than if you took out that crowd and calculated the love in the entire country! Shawn is a sweet guy, he has close friendships that are very notable. John Mayer, Charlie Puth, Niall Horan, Camila Cabello, many more( I dare not say Dhhrhshsh\u2019s name) the fandom is also extremely nice to each other.  It\u2019s very cute . I\u2019ve made SO many friendships in this fandom and I\u2019m now known as the \u2018crazy shawn girl\u2019 in my school of 4000! Shawn is also very kind, he often helps charities when he has free time. He said that instead of an artist to fan relationship, we have a person to person relationship with him. We love him because of his attitude. My Friend asked me very curiously \u201c if shawn was ugly, old, broke, not famous but loved you dearly, wanted to be your boyfriend, Husband, baby daddy, would you accept?\u201d \u201cHEAVENS YES!! The body, face(looks), fame, money are all bonuses! His attitude and self is enough for me! I love him, it isn\u2019t lust. He\u2019s genuine. Take notes, boys. ",
