            "answer_text": "You're comparing two very different things. Let's take a look at both the cases simultaneously. In foreign coutries, movies hardly have songs or no songs. So singers make money by tying-up with music labels and producing their own albums and songs. But in India things are completely different. Here we have 20 minutes of songs in a 2 hour movie. So bollywood is in dire need of singers to make their movies successful. This is the part where singers come in. Why would anyone want to take the risk of releasing albums whose success they aren't even sure of. Why would anyone leave a definite pay and go on indefinite paths. Moreover, in foreign countries, you cannot watch all the songs of a particular album on the internet but in India, ultimately all the songs are to be uploaded on the internet. Also, singers are not dependent on bollywood rather it is the other way round. You can always see some artists releasing their albums trying to make a mark in this country. But this is how it works in foreign coutries and in India. ",
