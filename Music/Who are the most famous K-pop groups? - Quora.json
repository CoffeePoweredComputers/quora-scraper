            "answer_text": "To the surprise of nobody, BTS was the most buzzed about K-pop act on the site, and each of its seven members were the most talked about K-pop stars. Stray Kids, EXO, Monsta X, NCT 127, and their associated members were also among some of the most popular K-pop act on the site. BTS is the overall second-most interacted with entity on Tumblr in 2019, second only to Good Omens. The top K-pop star on Tumblr in 2019 was BTS' youngest member Jungkook, followed by Jimin, V, Suga, RM, Jin, and J-Hope, respectively. Stray Kids' Bang Chan, EXO's Baekhyun, and NCT 127's Jaehyun rounded out the top 10. Jennie of BLACKPINK, ranked at No. 27, is the most-talked about female K-pop star. BLACKPINK was the seventh most popular K-pop group on the site this year. \u201cThere are five women in the top 50, three members of BLACKPINK and three members of Red Velvet,\u201d says Amanda Brennan, head of Content Insights & Social at Tumblr, who then referred to BLACKPINK\u2019s performance at Coachella and tours from both acts as potential reasons behind the surge. \u201cEven though the conversation can be dominated by boy groups, and boy groups tend to do more interviews in the U.S. than girl groups, I think girl groups are really having a moment and finding their fans when it may be a bit harder for them. We found 19 total women in the top 100, and I hope there are more next year.\u201d Last year, only TWICE\u2019s Momo appeared in Tumblr\u2019s Top 100 ranking of individual K-pop stars. Stray Kids\u2019 rise to the second biggest act on the site reflects a trend among Tumblr\u2019s users that Brennan says reflects their love of rookie K-pop acts, pointing to how ATEEZ, which debuted this year, ranked at No. 9, and other newer teams like The Boyz, ITZY, SuperM, Tomorrow X Together, and others made it among the ranking. \u201cWhen it comes to finding new groups, Tumblr\u2019s ahead of the curve,\u201d she says. \u201cYou find your group, and they become your babies. You love them and support them.\u201d Though the data is gathered from Tumblr\u2019s global audience, the fact that the site is an English-language site based in the U.S. reflects American trends particularly, and Brennan says that many of the groups gained traction when they toured or appeared in the U.S. Other factors, such as legal issues and departures from groups, also were reflected, as Tumblr does not take into account the way people engage with content on the site in its ranking. As such, someone like Seungri, who left BIGBANG after coming under investigation for a series of criminal allegations, appears on the list. BUT!

            "answer_text": "It really depends - do you mean the legendary groups or the currently popular/relevant groups? If you mean the legendary groups, there is Big Bang, SNSD, and 2NE1. There are also more groups like H.O.T., Super Junior, KARA, or Wonder Girls. Although these groups were extremely popular, they aren\u2019t too relevant at the moment. 2NE1 disbanded and most of the members of Big Bang are serving time in the military. H.O.T. was more popular in the very first era of K-pop and isn\u2019t talked about as much. Even if they aren\u2019t currently relevant, everyone will know what you\u2019re talking about if you mention them. Big Bang is a five-member boy group consisting of T.O.P, Seungri, G-Dragon, Daesung, and Taeyang. Some popular songs they have made are \u2018Fantastic Baby\u2019, \u2018If You\u2019, and \u2018Bang Bang Bang\u2019. They were formed by YG Entertainment. The majority of the members are currently serving time in the military as it is mandatory in South Korea.  2NE1 was a four-member girl group composed of Park Bom, CL, Dara, and Minzy. One popular song they made was \u2018I Am the Best\u2019, a truly iconic song. Later on, in their careers, Park Bom was involved in a drug scandal, leading to her being inactive for a long period of time. Her Instagram was found one or two years ago. CL focused on a music career in America, releasing \u2018Hello Bitches\u2019 and \u2018Lifted\u2019. Minzy was the first member to leave the group. After years of inactivity, it was officially stated that 2NE1 disbanded. Both 2NE1 and Big Bang were good friends - they were both formed by YG Entertainment and were both extremely successful at the time.  SNSD, otherwise known as Girls Generation, is a girl-group originally composed of nine members. Since then, four have left. Some popular songs they made are \u2018Gee\u2019, \u2018Oh!\u2019, \u2018Run Devil Run\u2019, and etc. They recently made a comeback called \u2018Lil Touch\u2019. Sooyoung, Tiffany, Seohyun, and Jessica have left the group. Jessica was actually voted to be kicked out of the group. People speculated that it was because she was focusing too much on her fashion line at the time, and didn\u2019t pay enough attention to the group.  The currently relevant/popular groups are probably Blackpink, EXO (I don\u2019t think they have released any new music recently, though), BTS (obviously), Red Velvet, TWICE, Stray Kids, and NCT. These groups are very popular when it comes to American fans, but I, unfortunately, do not know how popular some of these groups are in Korea as I haven\u2019t been there in a long time. I believe Red Velvet really reached their peak with Bad Boy and Peek-A-Boo because of the dark, sexier, femme fatale concept. The members from left to right are Joy, Yeri, Irene, Seulgi, and Wendy. Their most recent comeback, Power Up, is a cuter concept with a heavy use of yellows and blues - the complete opposite of Bad Boy and Peek-A-Boo.  Blackpink has always been popular since they debuted. If I\u2019m remembering correctly, they won an award for the most successful debut. Jennie, a main vocal and rapper in the group, is the Korean ambassador for Chanel. The members left to right are Rose, Jisoo, Jennie, and Lisa. All of the members except for Jisoo were born in foreign countries. Rose is a main vocal and has been featured in a few songs before her debut. Lisa is the main dancer and rapper. A dance cover she did for Cardi B\u2019s \u2018I Like It\u2019 recently came out.  TWICE was created through a competition/reality TV show, Sixteen. All of the members of the group except for two won the competition and consequently became immediate members of TWICE. Tzuyu and Momo, although disqualified, were voted by fans and chosen by JYP to join the group. They have released a number of popular songs such as \u2018What is Love\u2019, \u2018TT\u2019, \u2018Dance the Night Away\u2019, and they have recently made a Japanese debut. Their next comeback, \u2018Yes or Yes\u2019 will come out soon. TWICE usually sticks to cute concepts which make fans worried - the overuse of one concept can devastatingly lead to the fall of the group. The members from left to right are Tzuyu, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Nayeon, Chaeyeon, Dahyeon, Mina, and Momo.  BTS is possibly the most famous K-pop group out there. It\u2019s a familiar name to people who don\u2019t listen to K-pop as they are talked about all the time. BTS has attended multiple American music award programs and events, such as the AMAs. Some of their popular songs are \u2018Fake Love\u2019, \u2018DNA\u2019, and \u2018Idol\u2019. There are more, but those are just a few. The members from left to right are V (Taehyung), Suga, Jin, Jungkook, RM (stands for Rap Monster, real name is Namjoon), Jimin, and J-Hope.  I don\u2019t know much about EXO as I don\u2019t often listen to boy groups. I do know that many of the members are Chinese, forming a Korean-Chinese group. Originally, there were 12 members, but three have left since then. Tao, a former EXO member, was actually in the Chinese Produce 101 (competition based show similar to Sixteen), helping the female trainees train and debut. The picture below shows all 12 members. Tao, Lu Han, and Kris Wu have left.  Stray Kids is a nine-member rookie group, debuting last year. My knowledge is weak with this group.  NCT is a K-pop group with an unlimited amount of members, similar to Wonder Girls. It has multiple subgroups: NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream, and NCT 2018. Why there are so many groups is a question I cannot answer. I\u2019ll leave a website link that has each member with their name if the picture is too difficult to read.  ",
