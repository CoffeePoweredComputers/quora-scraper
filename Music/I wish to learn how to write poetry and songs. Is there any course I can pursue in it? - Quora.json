            "answer_text": "I'm sure that there may exist courses which promise to do just that. But in my humble opinion, writing well cannot be taught.  I do have some suggestions though: Read. A lot. Read whatever interests you, irrespective of your chosen field. Reading will help you with your language skills, which must reach a reasonably high level.Write- The first attempts will be horrible, especially if you're putting pen to paper and flexing your creative muscles after a long time. But obviously, improvement will take place over time.Find a mentor- Someone who is helpful and looking to guide newcomers. Cold email people like sociology professors, small magazine editors, random leading literary personalities and send them a sample of your work. Don't nag. The majority of people will not be interested, but some certainly will.Start a blog, maybe under a pen name. It's a great way to get feedback from the general public. Write what you want to, but keep in mind that most successful blogs are specialized.Hope this helps! ",

Let's come to the point; you can enroll in various creative writing courses at British Council (for English language writers.) The only thing required is the knowledge of the language you want to write in. Good luck :) ",
