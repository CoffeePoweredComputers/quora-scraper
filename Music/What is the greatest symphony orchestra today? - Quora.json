            "answer_text": "Supposedly the Vienna Philharmonic, if you believe the conventional wisdom. But if we're honest, any A level orchestra is getting several hundred applications for each job opening. They might invite 30-50 to audition in person. Of these 30-50 incredibly trained musicians, they'll pick one, and the one they pick is pretty likely to be considered \"the best.\" But if you were sitting at those auditions, I basically guarantee that you wouldn't pick the same person the orchestra picked. And the reason I can guarantee that is that I've been doing this for a long time, and I probably wouldn't be able to pick it either, because the differences they're listening for are so specific. Now imagine that this is happening on the much vaguer, more complex level of a whole orchestra. The top 20 or so orchestras in the world all exist on this level where they're what a jeweler would call \"eye clean.\" Even a sophisticated layperson would have a very hard time distinguishing between any of these orchestras and \"perfect,\" which is exactly why they get paid the big bucks (or, you know, medium-bucks, as the case may be). I wonder, sometimes, if more people realized that they couldn't tell the difference, whether that would increase or decrease symphony attendance. ",

            "answer_text": "One reason that this question is hard to answer quickly is the difference between halls (alluded to by David).  To a degree, the hall shapes the orchestra but that also makes the orchestra's quality hard to translate to a common frame of reference.   For one thing, orchestras often sound better on tour, where they have the luxury of a well-rehearsed program and audiences who are delighted to hear them for the first time.  I read one online commentator (a professional conductor) say that the New Orleans Philharmonic could, on tour, edge out the Chicago Symphony on one of its decent/good days at home.  And everyone knows of youth orchestras who give professional-quality performances on their summer tours.  This was a big PR problem for the New York Phil in the 50s-- Boston and Philadelphia routinely sent their orchestras for one-night shows with their best programs, along with every other great orchestra in the world.  The NYPSO was there several nights a week, with the usual variation in quality that you'd expect.  Many New Yorkers came to think that the local band wasn't as good as it actually was. On the other hand, orchestras used to one kind of hall don't always adapt easily to another.  I heard the Philadelphia Orchestra sound coarse and ragged beyond belief at the beginning of a concert in Boston's Symphony Hall.  Their own halls in Philly (especially the Academy of Music) allowed and encouraged a certain amount of overplaying--- which is absolute death at Symphony.  In contrast to Symphony Hall, Carnegie Hall gracefully handles a little too much sound, which may explain some of how the Fabulous Philadelphians earned their reputation in the 20s and 30s-- playing regularly as they did in front of New York audiences after rehearsing the programs in Philadelphia.
