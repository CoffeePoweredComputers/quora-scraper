            "answer_text": "I listen to pretty much everything. My Chemical Romance- it makes me feel safe. Is that odd? Probably. Marina and the Diamonds- it\u2019s just a bloody awesome band. The Fray- my grandpa loved The Fray, guess he passed that on to me Fall Out Boy- I don\u2019t know. Hedley- it\u2019s bloody fucking awesome! Elton John- he\u2019s bloody awesome and most of his songs make me sad, or smile Billy Joel- my dad loves Billy Joel. The Beatles- blame my mum. She likes The Beatles. I also listen to a lot of other bands and singers. Pretty much stuff from the 1960s-2012, but there\u2019s also Hedley and a few other bands. And I like stuff from musicals! The Easter Parade (1948), Mamma Mia (2008), Grease (1978), and Hairspray (2002) all have amazing soundtracks. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to cry over The Fault In Our Stars soundtrack because I just read the book for the second time yesterday (bought it Tuesday night) and it\u2019s just so sad!

            "answer_text": "My everyday music is Rock alternative. Like Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, the Arctic Monkeys, the Black Keys... or old rock such as Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix, Queen. When I'm studying I prefer classical music 'cause there are no lyrics to distract me: Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Chopin, Prokofiev mostly. When I'm driving I listen to pop music, something simple which puts me in a good mood. Also, I loooove to sing. I can listen to everything as long as the instrumental part is good and the lyrics make sense Haha, but my favourite pop artist is Lily Allen. When I'm on holidays I sometimes listen to some Electro music, but not agressive (for example, Disclosure). Or maybe some bossa nova (brazilian type of music which I recommand. It's awesome and really smells like hot summer :D) And finally, when I'm stressed out going to an exam, or when I'm not motivated to go to university, I listen some rap songs. Here the lyrics don't matter, as long as it's about self-confidence and success. So yeah, I admit it, I love some gangsta songs, they literally brainwash me, when I'm feeling down. 90's rappers are cool, Drake and so on too. But I prefer a french rapper called Orelsan. Best one to me! ",

In real life, I am a quiet and reserved fellow (and quite lazy too)! Heavy metal music is the only way I release all the energy pent up in me. Also, I came across this link a few days back. It proves one of the greatest misconceptions about heavy metal listeners wrong. And it is a perfect explanation of why I relate to metal music!

Honestly, Arabic songs are some of the most wonderful songs I\u2019ve heard in my life and I have a very long list of those that I listen to on a daily basis. I would end it here and say - I just listened to Arabic songs for 2 full hours. Nuff said. ",
