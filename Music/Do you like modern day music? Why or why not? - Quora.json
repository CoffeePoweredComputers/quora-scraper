            "answer_text": "My \u201cmodern day music\u201d I'm assuming Pop released in the last year. I will refer to it simply as \u201cPop\u201d. For the most part, I don't enjoy Pop music, especially when listening to it by myself. I do hear enough of it in the car or out in public (as well as some rap) to know what songs are popular, and even enough to comment on then. So here it goes. I'm a metalhead. I tend to appreciate harsher tones of metal music over the softer tones of pop. This is personal preference and a bias.It's overplayed. Literally every Pop station is a top 40 station, and worse yet, I will hear the same song more than 5 times in a day's worth of car rides (about an hour).It's too slow. Pop music has been slowing down lately. Even the dubstep/trap that current pop music took it's inspiration from was mellowed out and slowed down. Compare any pop song with a bass drop to a real dubstep song and see the difference.They're repetitive and have annoying sounds. 1/2 of the song (if not more) is chorus, just listen to \u201cGold\u201d by Kiiara. I'm not sure why this was the first song I thought of, but it is.Most artists aren't about the music or the lyrics. Actually, most songs now (exceptions: Ed Sheeran) have no music during the verse, except for a maybe barely audible bass line, use a very simple lick during the chorus, or if it features a bass drop (really the only instrumental music) its below par. Lyrics are also usually mediocre at best, with very little clever lyrics involved.These songs are surprisingly vulgar. Let's take \u201cSide to Side\u201d by Ariana Grande, its about sex. Let's take \u201cShape of You\u201d by End Sheeran, it's also about sex. Lots of other songs are about sex as well. They also swear so much (not that I have a problem with it). And yet, it's acceptable to play these songs in public (think of the children!).AUTOTUNE. Holy shit so much autotune! I get it, its a genre standard. But seriously, if you sound like Freddie Fucking Mercury on the radio and like my tone deaf uncle live, can you really call yourself a singer?Concerts. This is more of a complaint towards pop and hip-hop concerts and artists rather than the songs and music itself. Must you half assedly sing half the lyrics while your recorded song plays on the PA? I get it, you don't have a band to back you up, but can't you sing over just the backing track? (Watch any live performance from pop artists).",

            "answer_text": "Hmmmm, Well, that\u2019s a pretty hard question to answer just yes or no to. Let me ask you a question! \u201cDo you like food?\u201d That\u2019d be a pretty hard question to answer, wouldn\u2019t it? You might love vegetables, but dislike fruits. It would be difficult to make a blanket statement as to whether or not you like \u201cfood\u201d. There are so many different types of food, just as there are many different types of music. There\u2019s \u201cpop\u201d (I have no idea why we tend to call this a genre, the term is properly used to describe music that is popular\u2026) there\u2019s rap, hip-hop, indie, folk, country, rock, and many others. You can\u2019t group all of today\u2019s music into one category. That\u2019d be like putting Johnny Mathis\u2019 \u201cMisty\u201d in the same category as \u201cI Want To Hold Your Hand\u201d by The Beatles. They are from the same time period, (1959 & 1964) yet they are completely different songs. So, my answer would be yes and no. You\u2019re very unlikely to find me listening to rap, but toss on a little Bubl\u00e9 and I\u2019ll definitely enjoy it! There\u2019s still great music being made today; you just might have to work a little harder to find it\u2026 ",
