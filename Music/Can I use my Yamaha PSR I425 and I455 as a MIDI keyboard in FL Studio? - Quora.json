Same goes for MIDI OUT to MIDI OUT\u201d The accepted way actually makes a lot of sense. Think about it. You want MIDI data to go out of your controller and in to your sound module. After all, you wouldn\u2019t connect the audio out jack of your sound module to the outputs of your mixer, would you? No, you connect the audio output to an audio (mixer) input. And then you connect the mixer outputs to the inputs of your amplifier. And then you connect the amp\u2019s speaker outputs to the speaker inputs. Same thing with MIDI. Think of MIDI data as \u201cflowing\u201d in the same way that audio signals \u201cflow\u201d through your audio system. Still Confused? Or Want To Record Audio Tracks?

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can directly plug it in your laptop. You won\u2019t need a sound-card so you save up some money there. Although you might want to invest in one and studio monitors too if you wish to create studio quality tracks. Studio monitors and a nice pair of headphones would ensure you mix and master the frequencies perfectly. If you\u2019re just starting out in production, I won\u2019t recommend these add-ons. You just use what you have, master your craft and invest in them maybe later down the line. ",
