            "answer_text": "Buddy Holly (The Beatles\u2019 greatest musical influence / inspiration was undoubtedly Buddy Holly as they were infact named initially as the \u201cSilver Beetles\u201d rather than adopting the now iconic band name we know them as \u201cThe Beatles\u201d after Holly\u2019s backup rock and roll band, The Crickets. Both John Lennon & Paul McCartney admired / studied and have named Holly, his performance style & especially his songwriting skills as the biggest influence on them that affected them greatly / deeply to pick up instruments and form a band).Little Richard (in Paul McCartney\u2019s case, who admired Richard\u2019s vocal skills & especially his screaming style while performing on his songs).Elvis Presley (in both John Lennon\u2019s & George Harrison\u2019s case, as Lennon long before even forming his band, The Quarrymen & long before evolving the Quarrymen into the classic line-up of The Beatles in 1960, he (Lennon) recalled that once he heard \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d by Elvis Presley, later on saw Presley\u2019s attractive looking photos, saw him (Presley) perform live & suddenly saw how the crowd (mostly young teenage girls) reacted as they screamed on top of their lungs for Presley came to realize that he himself (Lennon) could also get the crowd & ladies to react in same hysterical wild screams in a manner that Presley did (as in future Lennon\u2019s band The Beatles\u2019 own female hysteria \u201cBeatlemania\u201d is known widely more than Presley phenomenon) & suddenly that \u201cscreaming\u201d factor was the primary reason of Lennon forming and starting a band / musical group with a bunch of his school friends whereas in Harrison\u2019s case the EXACT SAME song \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d by Elvis Presley was the record that influenced the then 16 year old George Harrison to audition for Lennon\u2019s Quarrymen band via on the request of Harrison\u2019s own school friend, McCartney).Chuck Berry.Bob Dylan (in all of the Beatles (John, Paul, George & Ringo\u2019s cases) musical style solo or when they were together for a short time recording career).Ravi Shankar (in ONLY George Harrison\u2019s case, who later on became an ardent devotee & great admirer of eastern Indian culture & music especially, asked Pandit Shankar to teach himself (Harrison) a sitar (Indian classical music instrument) & then after learning it went on to play the sitar successfully in the Beatles\u2019 1966 Rubber Soul album on the \u201cNorwegian Bird (It Has Flown)\u201d track, Interestingly George was the one & ONLY Beatle himself who encouraged all the other Beatles\u2019 (John, Paul, & Ringo) to travel to India for peace, meditation, yoga, etc\u2026\u2026\u2026 via the followings & teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a Hindu spiritual leader).The Everly Brothers.",
