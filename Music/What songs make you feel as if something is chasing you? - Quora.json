            "answer_text": "\u201cCan\u2019t Stop\u201d by Suicidal Tendencies. The song is about confronting and overcoming the voice in your head: The voice that fills you with doubt. The voice that wants you to give up when something gets \u201ctoo difficult\u201d. The voice that constantly sabotages you. The voice that gives you excuses for laziness and mediocrity. I couldn\u2019t find the spoken words from the beginning of the song, but it goes like this: And then you make me open my eyes, and come back All I wanted was some time\u2026some time to think - that\u2019s all I needed I would have been okay. With just a little time..MY time not YOUR time, you never have time. I don\u2019t even know why I try. You\u2019re probably here right now waiting\u2026 Waiting for that moment to ambush me. Slaughter my hopes, crush my confidence. Pound me down. Pound me down lower than you ever have before. Just so you can grab my heart and rip it out. ..and then you chew on, spit it out, throw it on the ground and stomp all over it. Laughing..laughing hysterically. Daring me to do something. Knowing that I won\u2019t. Knowing that I can\u2019t. Knowing that you\u2019re me and I\u2019m you, and I could never hate you as much as you hate me. Knowing the weaker I get, the stronger you are. Knowing how weak I am, knowing how strong you are\u2026.  ",
