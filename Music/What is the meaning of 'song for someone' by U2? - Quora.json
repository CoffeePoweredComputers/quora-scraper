            "answer_text": "Oh, Laura, I agree with you, but the album title is Songs of Innocence. Songs of Experience hasn't been released yet. Bono has often described the song as a love song dedicated to his wife Alison Hewson. I think he wrote it driven by the memories of being a young boy who didn't know what commitment was and ended up falling in love and marrying his High School sweetheart. Hope this is helpful. ",
