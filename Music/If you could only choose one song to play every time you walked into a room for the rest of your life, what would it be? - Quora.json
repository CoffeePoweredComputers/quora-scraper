            "answer_text": "Freddy's Dead by Curtis Mayfield But it wouldn't just be when I enter the room the music starts playing. Oh no no no. The opening riff of the song will just come out of nowhere. Smoke and shit starts rising from the floor. 5 seconds ago, your boring wife or girlfriend was sitting next to you. You look back over and she done turned into some throwback chick from a blaxploitation film. Those \u201cWanta Fanta\" chicks show up dancing and pandering Fanta. And about time Curtis hits that first line\u2026 soon as he goes, \u201cFreddy's dead\u2026.. that's what I said\" I done stepped in the room like BLAM!! Pose on em\u2026. Then I step off and go about my day. But that's only on the weekdays. On the weekend, ots a whole different groove. Same scenario, except now The Look Of Love by Issac Hayes is playing. I'm talking the 10 minute instrumental intro before he even starts singing version. Dig it: I'm already standing inside the frame of the door. Just checking the scene. No one has even paid attention or looked up to see me or anyone for that matter standing there. But the first person who does, that's when the music starts. Which prompts every one to look by this point. And if you know the songs then you know how it starts all light then the horns and drums. And I just float thru and continue about my day. OMG close your eyes can you see it lol\u2026 Its so player. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems like you\u2019d need any number of entry-songs, depending on what you are entering, the occasion, and even your own mood or attitude. All of which just gives me the opportunity to name more than one song\u2026 ;>) My \u201cHail To The Chief\u201d fanfare would be Gerry Rafferty\u2019s \u201cBaker Street\u201d, the most grandiose rock tune I know.  For more routine entrances, where a more easy-going expression is appropriate, maybe \u201cForever Young\u201d, by Chris Isaak.  It\u2019s early evening, the night is about to begin as I enter: \u201cLa Vie Dansante\u201d, by Aaron Neville.  For outdoor occasions, Chet Atkins and Tommy Emmanuel\u2019s beautiful version of Julian Lennon\u2019s \u201cSaltwater\u201d.  When I\u2019m feeling low-down and blue, I\u2019d choose \u201cEverybody Needs Love\u201d, by Drive-by Truckers.  My \u201cNo-Entry\u201d song, which in truth, would be the one playing on repeat most or the day back at home, is Joan Armatrading\u2019s \u201cMe, Myself I\u201d.  ",
