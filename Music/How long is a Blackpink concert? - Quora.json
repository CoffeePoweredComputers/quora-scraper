            "answer_text": "A BLACKPINK concert would typically last about 2 hours. This would include them doing all of their songs, as well as interacting with the fans from the stage as well as doing a few covers of songs composed by others. Their concerts tend to be shorter because they don't have many songs as it is, and it is a struggle to fill in any time more than that. However, as their career progresses and they have more comebacks, it is more than likely that their concert lengths would increase. In addition, as BLACKPINK\u2019s popularity continues to grow, expect an increase in stadium size and therefore an increase in concert lengths because organisers have to account for the time taken for fans to get seated. Do arrive a few hours in advance of the concert (as with any concerts by performing artistes). Be prepared for extra long queues, screaming fans and general unruliness - especially when BLACKPINK make an appearance. But as with all concerts, do try to be respectful of artistes at all times, as well as other fans who have come to attend the concert too. The duration of a Blackpink concert, though listed as 2 plus hours, does not take into account the time required to commute to the concert venue, obtain a parking spot (if applicable), time taken to line up to enter the stadium, buy merch, queue to get out and the commute home. All in all, I estimate that it will take a good 5\u20136 hours for an optimum experience. Do enjoy your time there. ",
