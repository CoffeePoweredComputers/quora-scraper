            "answer_text": "This is what I found on WikiPedia about White Rabbit and its composer Grace Slick. \"White Rabbit \" is one of Grace Slick's earliest songs, written during either late 1965 or early 1966. It utilizes imagery found in the fantasy works of Lewis Carroll: 1865's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its 1871 sequel Through the Looking-Glass, such as changing size after taking pills or drinking an unknown liquid. Slick had stated the composition was intended to be a slap to parents who would read their children such novels, and then wonder why their children would later use drugs.  Characters Slick referenced include Alice, the hookah-smoking caterpillar, the White Knight, the Red Queen, and the Dormouse. Although for Slick, White Rabbit \"is about following your curiosity. The White Rabbit is your curiosity\", For her and others in the 1960s, drugs were a part of mind-expanding and social experimentation. With its enigmatic lyrics, \"White Rabbit\" became one of the first songs to sneak drug references past censors on the radio. Even Marty Balin, Slick's eventual rival in Jefferson Airplane, regarded the song as a \"masterpiece\". In interviews, Slick has related that Alice in Wonderland was often read to her as a child, and remained a vivid memory well into her adulthood. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Slick mentioned that in addition to Alice in Wonderland her other inspiration for the song was \"thebolero used by Miles Davis and Gil Evans on their 1960 album Sketches of Spain.\"  The song is essentially one long crescendo similar to that of Ravel's famous Bol\u00e9ro. The music combined with the song's lyrics strongly suggests the sensory distortions experienced withhallucinogens, and the song was later used in pop culture to imply or accompany just such a state.

            "answer_text": "I think this is a funny question since there are few songs I can think of with a more unsubtle message than \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d. As many others have noted, it\u2019s meaning is basically twofold: first, that your parents are shallow hypocrites who are too square to get the deeper implications of the stories they read you and who encourage the taking of boring drugs while condemning the cool ones and second, to go ahead and take those cool drugs. Message-wise, it\u2019s of a piece with most of the band\u2019s oeuvre. Hippies are today often stereotyped as insipid space cases with an aversion to conflict. But the default emotion of the Airplane, who in their heyday were considered to be counterculturists par excellence, was exactly the sort of in-your-face, self-righteous fury you hear in \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d. I love Jefferson Airplane (one of the great things about the internet is being able to hear their concerts. Particularly in 1967 and \u201868, they were absolute psychedelic monsters), but I don\u2019t like \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d and never have. It\u2019s not really a song\u2014it\u2019s more of a chant that builds to a climax that, when it comes, isn\u2019t satisfying. Neither its generation gap snottiness nor it\u2019s enthusiastically pro-drug message have aged well and musically it isn\u2019t interesting. But there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s had both impact and staying power. There\u2019s barely a TV show, movie or documentary made about the 60s in the last 50 years that doesn\u2019t feature either it or its companion JA hit, \u201cSomebody To Love\u201d, somewhere in the soundtrack. It\u2019s interesting that both those songs, which together are pretty much the only thing people under 50 know about the once-mighty Airplane, originated in Grace Slick\u2019s first band, The Great Society. In my opinion, Jefferson Airplane\u2019s original songs were pretty bad, or at least not very memorable. \u201cThe House at Pooneil Corner\u201d and \u201cCrown of Creation\u201d have their charms, but catchiness isn\u2019t among them. The Great Society, on the other hand, had a bunch of great songs. Pull up their 1966 live recording \u201cConspicuous Only In Its Absence\u201d on YouTube and just listen to \u201cGrimly Forming\u201d or \u201cDidn\u2019t Think So\u201d, along with the original versions of the biggies. If you want a song about doing acid, \u201cOften As I May\u201d beats \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d in my book every time.  ",
