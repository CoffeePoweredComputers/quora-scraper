Genre- Teen Drama, Mystery.  Kevin- \u201cBetty\u2019s ponytail is iconic and beyond reproach.\u201d  10. LOST It was the best.

My. God.\u201d  13. DARK INTENSE. Periodt. About the plot, When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the same town in 1986. (Edit: I had to come back here after watching the latest season. It totally deserves all the hype it\u2019s getting rn. It\u2019s confusing as hell but boy was it worth it! I guarantee you, it\u2019s a whole different and another level ride. If you haven't already, then please go watch it.) Genre- Sci-fi, Supernatural, Mystery, Thriller, Drama.   14. SACRED GAMES. Worth Watching. About the first season, Saif and Nawazuddin, they were the gems of the series! The iconic \u201cGaitonde\u201d and \u201cSartaj Singh\u201d and their criminal-cop chase. Every scene of Gaitonde was a masterpiece. If you hadn\u2019t watch it already, please do. Genre- Thriller, Mystery, Crime.   15. THE 100. 6 seasons with full of adventure(7 is yet to come).

THE WALKING DEAD Okay, this show has it\u2019s own fan base and haters also( coz you know, they keep murdering our favorite ones) Apart from everything, this is still the best show ever. It has something which keeps you addicted to it. You get disappointed, you keep watching. Story- Well, everyone has heard about this show. Still, Rick Grims, a police officer, travels in search of a safe and secure home after a zombie apocalypse spreads across the USA. Best Zombie show. The first 5\u20136 seasons are just BREATH-TAKING. Genre- Zombies\u2026\u2026\u2026..  Rick- \u201cYou really think you\u2019re gonna take this community from us. From Glenn? From Michonne? From Daryl? From me?

OZARK Again a Crime Drama not as good as the above one but worth watching.

TRUE DETECTIVE. Season 1 for the starters, it just blew you away. The detectives, the policemen solving murders and crimes while unraveling dark secrets about themselves as well as others around them. Interesting. Genre- Crime, Drama, Mystery.   24. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER. You know, the alternative option for friends? This sitcom. Not as big hit as friends but definitely worth watching.

Genre- Sci-fi, Drama.   26. SUITS Office drama and romance. The reason behind I watched this show was Meghan Markle specifically. And it turns out to be a good show. Genre- Drama, Romance, Comedy.   27. SUPERNATURAL I love Dean Winchester and his sense of humor!! You wanna watch hot brothers fighting with ghosts and all sorts of supernatural creatures? This is your show They ran like for a full decade(more than that actually), 15 Seasons. The 15th one is going on rn! There\u2019s a new story in every episode beside their own going on in the back( you know family drama). Once you reach the 2nd or 3rd season, you get addicted. Eventually, they\u2019re out of stories now(I think) and this is the very last season of this show( I\u2019m gonna miss it) Genre- Supernatural, Crime, Horror.   28. GREY\u2019S ANATOMY. A Medical Drama. There\u2019re many other good medical shows too, to watch such as \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d, \u201cHouse M.D.\u201d, etc.. But this one is also not that bad. The medicos among you can binge-watch it. Genre- Romance, Drama.   29. THE END OF THE F***ING WORLD Dark humor. It\u2019s about two 17-year-old teens, James and Alyssa, who goes on a road trip to find her father, who left home when she was just a child. Genre- Drama, dark comedy.   30. NEW AMSTERDAM. The reason for watching this show was \u201cAnupam Kher\u201d in it. A decent and good medical Drama. Genre- Medical Drama.   31. YOU. Love obsession. An obsession that even forces you to kill someone. The main lead(Joe) really scares at some points in the show but that's the beauty of the show, isn\u2019t it? Well, that is somewhat happening here. A bookstore manager finds himself attracted to a girl but soon that attraction turned into an obsession. But I\u2019ll tell you, stay away from such people in real life. It\u2019s only good on the screen. Genre- Crime, Drama, Romance, Psychological.   32. BLINDSPOT Action-packed crime drama. Genre- Crime, Action, Mystery, Thriller.  (It has a twin name show, \u201cBlackspot\u201d I get confused sometimes but hey I know this for sure they both are pretty good)  33. HOUSE OF CARDS. American Political thriller. I love shows with strong female leads and this show certainly has one It has won many awards. The final season was the best season of all!! Watch it if you\u2019re into politics drama stuff. Genre- Politics, Crime, Drama, Mystery.   34. GOTHAM. For those who are into DC comics! Genre- Crime, Drama, Action, Thriller, Mystery.   35. 13 REASONS WHY. I mentioned this show because I think the 1st season is definitely worth giving a try. (But people, just watch it for entertainment purpose, don\u2019t let any character brain-wash you!) Genre- Drama, Mystery, Teen Drama.  Hannah- \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say this to me when I was alive?\u201d  36. THIS IS US. If you\u2019re looking for some decent peaceful show (other than these actions, mystery, thriller, etc)and some good romantic one, you\u2019re not gonna disappoint with this. It has high ratings, good critics\u2019 reviews, and some great performances by the actors. Genre- Romance and Drama.   37. SENSE 8 It\u2019s not like any other show. It\u2019s quite different! It was a disappointment though, it ended so soon(2 seasons) Genre- Sci-fi, Drama.   38. KILLING EVE. 2 seasons till now and still going on! They say once you start this series, there isn\u2019t any looking back. Just 2 seasons and it has already won numerous awards. British one! Genre- Crime, Drama, Thriller.  Villanelle- \u201cYou Should Never Tell A Psychopath They Are A Psychopath. It Upsets Them.\u201d  39. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. These vampires are always a topic of attention, right? A 90\u2019s vampire show. If you\u2019re into vampires, give it a try. I admire her character for never taking any bullshit from Men! Genre- Horror(not at all), Supernatural, Mystery, Drama.   40. CHICAGO FIRE. Well, I wasn\u2019t gonna mention it first, but I think people who like watching some shows on a regular basis, like 2\u20133 episodes per day, they can give it a try. It\u2019s based on the daily lives of the people of the Chicago fire department. Rating is not bad. It\u2019s the first installment of the Chicago series. Some really handsome people here(don\u2019t mind me) Genre- Action, Drama.   41. THE CROWN. Queen and palace vibes The best Historical drama on Her Majesty! If you\u2019re even slightly interested in the British Royal Family, you must watch it. It is so good. The transformation of a princess into a queen is really worth watching. Genre- Historical-Drama, Romance, Politics.  Queen- \u201cHistory was not made by those who did nothing.\u201d One more, I\u2019ll mention here, it\u2019s also a royal historical drama, but it\u2019s more romantic than the above one, \u201cREIGN\u201d, it\u2019s sweet to watch:-)  42. PRISON BREAK. Again some hot brothers and loads of action and suspense;) 5 Seasons with 8.3 ratings. Genre- Action, Thriller, and Drama.   43. MONEY HEIST. This show is a masterpiece in a true sense You seeing a team below in the pic. Well, this is quite an interesting and different show. They all team up to go for the biggest heist. Dude, you\u2019re gonna love our Professor. It\u2019s in Spanish. Genre- Heist, Thriller, Crime, Drama.   44. MINDHUNTER. Sometimes you need to think from the criminal\u2019s pov to understand their moves! That\u2019s what this show is about and believe me it\u2019s the best crime show. Genre- Crime, Psychological Thriller.  Bill Tench- \u201cHow do we get ahead of crazy if we don\u2019t know how crazy thinks?\u201d  45. THE HAUNTING OF THE HILL HOUSE. I think I didn\u2019t mention any horror one, well, this one is good in that category. Great casting. Genre- Horror, Mystery.  Shirley: \u201cIt watches,\u201d he added suddenly. \u201cThe house. It watches every move you make.\u201d  46. GOSSIP GIRLS. Enough with action, crime, etc guys, here are some high school teen dramas to take your mind off. High school, girls, their boyfriends, their secrets, their best-friends and drama, drama, and drama. 6 Seasons and Binge-Watching show. Genre- Drama and Romance.  Blair- \u201cThree words. Eight letters. Say it and I\u2019m yours.\u201d  47. PRETTY LITTLE LIARS. Almost the same as Gossip girl but more interesting because of its twists and turns, and the iconic mystery of \u201cA\u201d. I loved the squad of Aria(Lucy Hale), Emily(Shay Mitchell), Spencer(Troian) and Hanna(Ashley Benson). Everyone has their favorite one. Mine was definitely Emily Fields. I loved her spirit and positivity. Genre- Mystery, Thriller, Drama, Romance.   48. ELEMENTARY. If you\u2019re a die-hard fan of Sherlock Holmes(like me) and you\u2019re not done with just 13 episodes of original Sherlock series, you can watch thi s one. Though it\u2019s not the same, there\u2019re some changes in it. A big one is John Watson is a lady named \u201cJoan H. Watson\u201d They\u2019re in New York not in London. They live in Manhattan, not at 221B Baker Street. There\u2019re 6 seasons with 23\u201324 episodes in each one, not just 3 episodes. Actually, it\u2019s the contemporary version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s character Sherlock Holme. It\u2019s not as good as the original one(I mean that was just incomparable) but it\u2019s still something and worth watching:) Genre- Crime, Mystery, Thriller.   I\u2019ve watched almost all of them fully or partially!!! Do let me know if you know some other good ones:) Reason for not including GOT, not quite a fan!!! Edit 1- There\u2019re so many comments about GOT. Why is it so hard to understand that someone can be Anti-GOT?! I know a lot of people love GOT but again I can\u2019t just put anything which I don\u2019t like. Edit 2- I think many of you guys are pissed off because I didn\u2019t add these shows, so here are they from your recommendations,  49. LUCIFER. Interesting plot. High fan-following. Great Performance. So, Worth Watching. A demon, Lucifer, is living in LA and helping out cops in solving crimes but life isn't that easy. Right? Genre- Crime, Mystery, Romance, and Drama.   50. DEXTER. Serial killing always interests me Good show. You\u2019ll love this serial killer. Genre- Crime, Drama, Thriller.   51. BIG BANG THEORY. Underrated one. You\u2019re so not going to disappoint watching it. Find out yourself?! \u201cFour friends, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj and their rollercoaster journey.\u201d Genre- Comedy. Comedy. Comedy.   52. HOUSE MD I\u2019ve heard so much about this show and I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s a good medical drama out there! It\u2019s about Dr. House who is a physician and has his own rules when it comes to treating patients\u2019 illnesses. Genre - Comedy, Medical Drama.   53. NARCOS. I like the title. The show is a crime drama based on a real high rating. It\u2019s mainly about the rise of the cocaine trade in Colombia and the real-life stories of drug mafias of the '80s. Genre- Crime, Drama, Thriller, Suspense, Action.   54. THE MENTALIST. Again a good crime drama. I tell you there\u2019re very good crime dramas there to watch! Genre- Crime, Drama.   55. CRIMINAL MINDS. Again Crime Drama. Just keep scrolling;) Genre- Crime, Drama, Thriller, Suspense.   56. THE BLACKLIST. Action-packed crime thriller series. Those who\u2019re into crime stuff, another one for you. Genre- Crime, Action, Thriller.   57. TEEN WOLF. A good fantasy one. If you watch this show you\u2019ll love Stiles Stilinski and his sense of humor Watch it if you\u2019re into supernatural with romance and comedy. A teen werewolf, his high-school, his pack, friends, relationships. All in all, it\u2019s interesting to watch it. Genre- Supernatural, Romance, Drama, Thriller, Comedy.   58. THE HANDMAID\u2019S TALE. This is some real stuff. This show has won many awards for its storyline, for the great performances, etc. I strongly recommend this show. June, the main lead, is a fertile woman who bears the child of her owners and lives under the strong rules and restrictions. I love how she fights for her independence as a woman, for her right! Genre- Sci-fi, Drama.   59. ALTERED CARBON. No words for this show. You gotta find yourself... (you\u2019ll find good:) Genre- Sci-fi, Drama, Mystery, Thriller.   60. DEATH NOTE. I\u2019m not really into Anime. But this one is really good. A high rating and high following(who loves anime!) show. It\u2019s about a high school student who discovers a supe rnatural notebook that grants it\u2019s owner the ability to kill anyone/anything! Interesting right? It is. Genre- Anime.   EDIT 3- I am going to add some more shows. Most of them are the latest Netflix series. So, keep scrolling if you are interested>> . . 61. THE SOCIETY. The High school students return from their trip and found that all of the adults in the town are gone. There is no one left in the town. Their freedom is fun at first but then it becomes dangerous. While they struggle to figure out what has happened to them and how to get the town back to normal, they must form orders and alliances in order to survive there! Now that you know the storyline, I tell you this show is good if you\u2019re looking for new series. Apart from Allie\u2019s acting, some of the Campbell scenes really terrifies the hell out of you. Genre- Mystery.   62. GREENHOUSE ACADEMY. It has a little of everything. A little adventure, little romance, little mystery, and some thrilling events. A decent timepass teen-series. Just 25\u201330 mins episodes. It\u2019s about the students in the \u201cGreenhouse Academy\u201d Genre- Drama, Adventure, Mystery.   63. THE RAIN. In teresting plot. The rain in Scavandia has some kind of virus which soon evacuates the whole life from there. Two siblings, after six years, get out of the bunker where they were hiding the whole time and then get along with some other survivors in search of food and home. Genre- Mystery, Thriller, Drama.   64. ALEXA AND KATIE. A good comedy one for timepass. Alexa and Katie are BFFs! Alexa has cancer but she keeps her enthusiasm for life while Katie is always by her side. Genre- Comedy.   65. RUSSIAN DOLL. You gonna say, \u201cWhy the hell I didn\u2019t watch it before?\u201d So before wasting any more time, watch it. Natasha Lyon ne has done an amazing job. Genre- Mystery, Comedy.   66. DEAD TO ME. Well\u2026.just watch it for some dark comedy and drama. Genre- Comedy, Mystery, Drama.   67. TIMELESS Watching this show was fun. It has two seasons, but hey, don\u2019t let the fact that this legendary show was given only 2 seasons worth of airtime fool you! We always had this interest in the concept of \u201cTime-Machine\u201d. We all think of how we would change things if we could go back in time. I love adventurous shows and this one has some very important people from history. So, adventurous and history fans will love it for sure :) Genre- Adventure, History, Sci-fi, Mystery, Drama.  Another Time-Travel show, \u201c12 Monkeys\u201d, you sure have heard of it, if not then go watch it.  68. LOCKE & KEY Imagine you have a key and you can go to any place in the world with that key. Sounds magical, isn\u2019t it?! Well, this series is quite magical. If you\u2019re a fan of magic with some thriller and suspense, go for it. Genre: Supernatural, Horror, Drama.   69. ANNE WITH AN E This series is so col. The cast is amazing. The plot is decent. It\u2019s a beautiful historical drama. It is based on a classic book about a 13-year-old orphan who is seeking love, acceptance, and her place in the world. Genre: Historical drama, Coming of age   70. UNBELIEVABLE. This mini-series of 8 episodes made me so angry. The idea of \u201cserial rapist\u201d boils my blood. And above that how people change their behaviour towards you. It is based on a true story. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine that. I mean I coudn\u2019t just watch it, let alone actually going through something like that. All you wonder is how some people terribly fails at humanity. Watch it for some bitter truth of life. And be safe. Genre: Crime, Drama.   Edit- Let me clear this, I just didn\u2019t put any show in my list without proper thorough knowledge, so if I am telling you it\u2019s worth watching, it is. But of course, you got to choose your genre yourself. If you feel like the following shows aren\u2019t your types, then skip them and move on. And yes, I am a movie and series buff so, yeah, my list is gonna be pretty long one>>> - ",

            "answer_text": "Every year, the best producers work very hard to bring new and exciting TV series. They\u2019re trying to get the most precious prize for a producer\u2026 our attention. I personally think that these 10 TV Series are worth watching: 10. Silicon Valley  The main character, Richard Hendrix, has created a superior compression algorithm. And with the help of his friends, he creates the company called Pied Piper in Silicon Valley. They are gifted programmers but lack business experience. And this leads to a serious of mistakes that put their startup at risk multiple times. 9. Brooklyn Nine-Nine  Probably one of the best comedy series right now. Jake Peralta is a talented detective who loves to solve cases but doesn\u2019t like rules. As Seargent Terry Jeffords says on the first episode: \u201cJacob Peralta is my best Detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn\u2019t solved is how to grow up.\u201d Everything changes when Raymond Holt becomes the Captain of Brooklyn 99 precinct. Outwardly he is strict, professional, and love rules. But on the inside he is warm, and empathic who cares deeply about employees under his command. 8. Mindhunter It\u2019s a Netflix TV Series based on the true story of the man who pioneered the science of profiling serial killers, John Douglas. FBI agent Holden Ford had the idea of interviewing individuals who committed gruesome crimes. His partner is Bill Tench. Together they seek to understand how a serial killer thinks. And by the way, Bill\u2019s character is based on the FBI agent Robert Ressler who\u2019s credited for coining the term \u2018serial killer\u2019. 7. You  This show didn\u2019t attract much attention in Lifetime but its debut on Netflix was huge. Netflix said that You were watched by 40 million households in the first month. It\u2019s based on the novel with the same name by Caroline Kepnes. A seemingly charming bookstore manager meets a beautiful aspiring writer. By using Social Media he finds information which helps him get close to her. And he makes sure to remove every obstacle in his way. 6. Breaking Bad  It\u2019s one of the best-written TV Series. The story of a protagonist who turned into an antagonist. Walter White is an ordinary chemistry teacher who also works at a car wash to make enough money for the family. But one day he collapses and is given a terrible diagnosis, stage-3 inoperable lung cancer. Walter along with his student Jesse Pinkman joins the world of crime and sell methamphetamine to make as much money as possible for his family before he dies. 5. Lucifer  The lord of hell gets tired of ruling the underworld and takes a vacation in Los Angeles where he opens a nightclub. Lucifer has drama, comedy, fantasy, great music, and interesting characters. What more could you ask from a TV show? 4. Mr. Robot  Elliot Anderson is a young man living in New York City. He works for cybersecurity company Allsafe during the day and a vigilante hacker by night. He struggles with social anxiety, clinical depression, and paranoia. A mysterious group called fsociety recruits him to hack Evil Corp - a company that was responsible for the death of his father. Ramy Malek\u2019s extraordinary performance and the mesmerizing cinematography make \u201cMr. Robot\u201d a must-watch series. 3. Game of Thrones  Probably one of the most popular series in the world. In the mythical land of Westeros, several noble families fight for control of the seven kingdoms. As conflict erupts in the kingdom, an ancient enemy awakens to threaten them all. 2. Narcos  Netflix goes back to the \u201980s to tell the story of Pablo Escobar. The drug lord who was smuggling millions of dollars worth of cocaine in the USA every week. The DEA, Colombian police, AUC, and Cali Cartel had one goal\u2026 to kill Escobar. Well, the first 2 seasons follow the rise and death of Escobar. The third season is focused on bringing down Cali Cartel. Narcos portrays the fear and violence which captured Colombia during the \u201980s and \u201990s but is nowhere near as bad as what happened back then. 1. The Big Bang Theory I love this show. I have seen the episodes repeatedly and always make me laugh. It all started with Leonard and Sheldon, two brilliant but socially awkward physicists. Then a beautiful waitress/aspiring actress called Penny moves in next door. Leonard falls in love with her and makes it his life mission to get the penny to be his girlfriend.  Image source Penny quickly becomes part of their group which also includes the engineer Howard Wolowitz, and Astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. ",
