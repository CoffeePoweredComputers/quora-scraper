            "answer_text": "For me as a Asian-American who majored in Chinese and now working and living in China (and who also loves to sing at KTV), it was never about whether the song is in Cantonese or Mandarin (because there are also many Hokkien songs that are often sung at karaoke bars here in China by those who don\u2019t even speak Hokkien), but more importantly does the song have good lyrics, how is the medley, does the song sing to your heart and soul, is the singer good, the instrumentation, the mixing etc. However, there are some times where one version is probably preferred more. Often this is the case where a particular Chinese song, especially many pop songs in the 90s from Hong Kong, will have both a Cantonese and Mandarin version. Although Cantonese and Mandarin are more or the less the same when written in standard Chinese (disregarding Cantonese songs that were intentionally written in colloquial Cantonese such as many Sam Hui\u2019s songs), it\u2019s uncommon that the Cantonese and Mandarin version of one song will share the exact lyrics. Sometimes, they\u2019re not even the same lyrics yet the medley is still the same. Theoretically, you could sing the Cantonese version of the song in Mandarin and vice versa but it would sound strange, even though the meaning is still understandable across. Especially in Cantonese, certain words in the lyrics rhyme however will not rhyme in Mandarin. Another reason why many HK pop songs will have Mandarin lyrics added is to allow for a broader audience to have access to the song who may not be able to understand, let alone, sing in Cantonese. One of my good friends is a die hard Jackie Cheung fan who is from Ningxia, and even though he doesn\u2019t speak Cantonese, he will always sing the Cantonese versions of Jackie Cheung\u2019s songs. He says, they sound better in Cantonese where the Mandarin lyrics are sometimes quite strange. On the other hand, one of my wife\u2019s favorite singers is Wong Faye and she has several songs that were originally written in Mandarin with Cantonese lyrics added later. Are the Cantonese lyrics bad? No, but compared to the original Mandarin lyrics, there is a certain feeling of the original song that has been lost because the lyrics are totally different. That reminds me. There was one song many years ago that became very popular because Mandarin lyrics were added yet it had existed originally as a Cantonese song. The Mandarin version is \u201c\u7231\u60c5\u8f6c\u79fb\u201d from Eason Chan (not to confuse with Edison Chen, the famous photographer - LOL) and the original Cantonese version is \u201c\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u4e0b\u201d (also sung by Eason Chan). The song was used as a theme song for a Mainland Chinese film called \u201c\u7231\u60c5\u547c\u53eb\u8f6c\u79fb\u201d (Call For Love) and was a popular film back in 2007. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 9 maximum tones for a lot of words in Cantonese, whereas in Mandarin there are only 4. So it is definitely easier for Cantonese lyrics to sound just as they would in normal conversations (because it is more likely for the lyricist to find words that fit the corresponding musical note). IMO Cantonese lyrics have a larger effect to its audience, because it\u2019s as if they are \u201cspoken\u201d to you (aaaaaaahh, saw that pun? lol) Mandarin songs on the other hand are also really nice, but for me it\u2019s more to do with the level of talent they have in mainland China\u2026Afterall, there are 1.3bn people in mainland China, and only 7m in Hong Kong. As for me, I am from Hong Kong, but I am also what I call \u201cauditory lyrically dislexic\u201d, so I like Mandarin songs for their range of singers, and I like Canto songs for familiarity; lyrics don\u2019t get factored in for me, unfortunatley.
