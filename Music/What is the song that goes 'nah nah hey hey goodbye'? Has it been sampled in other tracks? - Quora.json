Riffs of some parts of the song have been suggested by some people, but nothing that probably was an intentional theft of the music, just more of a tribute to the popularity of the song included in passing in a wholly unrelated tune.

This was a cover version and the original was by a band in the 1960s called Steam (weird promotional stuff for that as the band -all males- are all in a sauna). \u2026and yes it\u2019s been sampled many, many times\u2026..most notably by Mr. J. Zed on his track D.O.A. (death of autotune), Lady Gaga - Chillin (both from 2009) and lastly Snoop Dogg - Light it up (2016). ",
