            "answer_text": "There are many, but you need to know Screaming Lord Sutch.  He was a British singer in the early 60s. He discovered many great musicians as they were young, including Deep Purple founder Ritchie Blackmore. His stage act was full of spectacle and horror. He'd dress his band, the Savages, on thematic clothing (cavemen, gladiators etc) and often would chase band mates onstage with axes.  (Blackmore seems to be the second from left to right, on the back.) He was Alice Cooper before Alice Cooper. One of his most famous songs was about Jack the Ripper.  Yeah, he DID like to scare a crowd.  Also in the 60s, he began founding political parties and running for office. He never won, but he scored a record of unsuccessful candidacies: he lost more than 40 elections between 1963 and 1997.  His last party was the Monster Raving Loony Party, which proposed interesting policies like abolishing the income tax. The tax, they said, was created to fund the war against Napoleon. So many years after the French emperor's death, they thought it was about time to cease hostilities. But they also proposed things that became law, such as voting at 18. It was taken as a loony idea when they first proposed it. But then Sutch suffered of depression. In 1999, he committed suicide. At his request, his funeral was a party no one in their sane mind would have wanted to miss.  Without their chief figure, the Loonies had to find a new face. A relatable face. A face for new times. So, in 2001 they announced the naming of a tabby cat named Cat Mandu as a leader. It was the only cat ever to be named leader of a political party. Cat Mandu also ran for office and had all of 125 votes.  Their motto was \u201cVote for Insanity. You know it makes sense.\u201d Of course, the Loonies were a disappointment when they got closer to power. But such (not Sutch) is the nature of power. ",
