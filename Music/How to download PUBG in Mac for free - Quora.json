            "answer_text": "Well first of all, there\u2019s no legal way of getting around buying the game itself. As far as running the game goes, I highly recommend Nvidia GeForce Now\u2019s open beta which is currently free and has rolling admissions. Otherwise you could look into setting up a virtual rig through AWS with PUBG installed on it, I\u2019d recommend checking out Parsec and Paperspace, this way you could get a credit for a few hours for free (Note: long term this solution costs money, however you can do a cost comparison to the cost of a physical gaming rig and, as mentioned above, you can get a few hours free.) This method is similar to the cloud streaming technology that Nvidia uses, and it\u2019s worth noting that on the very sad day that Nvidia ends the open beta, it will almost certainly no longer be a free service either. You can learn a lot more about all of this over at r/macgaming on Reddit. It may be possible to get a Wine wrapper to work with it as well - but your mileage may vary. If you\u2019ve got good internet speeds check out one of these cloud streaming services. You\u2019ll be glad you did, and it\u2019s the way of the future! We\u2019re likely seeing the end of the console era as we speak with the evolution of high speed internet and cloud streaming services, so why not get ahead of the curve? ",
