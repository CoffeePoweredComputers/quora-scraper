By way of explanation, the city of Boulder, Colorado (my home town) has an iconic relationship with natural stone formations, located just west of the city, which are called The Flatirons. Images of these rock formations appear as a logo on the city website, on official city documents, and so forth. There are also a multiude of local businesses that incoporate this word into their names, by way of shouting to the world \u201cWe are Boulder!\u201d Examples include Flatirons Theatre, Flatiron Meal Plan, Flatiron Paving Company, etc. Hence my proposed name for a local band: The Flatirons. The Flatirons are Boulder\u2019s best rock group. ",
