            "answer_text": "I don't think the higher or lower denominations of currencies has anything to about inflation. They exists to support transactions easy for high priced products and lower priced products. For example one can use say a 5 unit currency to buy 20000 products making a total sale of 100000. Suppose the demand for product in the economy is 25000, then the deficit will ensure that the inflation forms. Now suppose if one uses 100 unit currency to buy 1000 products in supply. Now if the existing  demand in the economy is 1300 or more then again the inflation appears to form in this product market.  This simple example shows that the denomination doesn't matter, it is the supply and demand situation that sources inflation. ",

            "answer_text": "Higher denomination of notes / printing currecy to resolve backdrops in the economy is considered the most unprofessional way to tackle a economic situation . If we put additional cash or money in the market it will increase money supply in the market. Increased money supply will give more purchasing power to the consumers . And when too much money chases too little output it will automatically increase inflation. ",
