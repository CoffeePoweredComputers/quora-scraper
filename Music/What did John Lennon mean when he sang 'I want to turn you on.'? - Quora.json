            "answer_text": "Well, the most straightforward interpretation is \u201cI want to get you high on drugs.\u201d That\u2019s certainly what the BBC thought, which is why they banned it. It also fits what happens musically in the song both times it is sung: it\u2019s as if the session orchestra players have just dropped acid. Of course, Lennon could have also argued that it was meant as in \u201cI want to raise your level of consciousness (not necessarily with drugs),\u201d or even \u201cI want to get you sexually aroused\u201d (the latter interpretation also fits the music, as everything builds up to an \u201corgasm\u201d). But I seriously doubt he cared enough about the BBC ban to try to convince them to air it. Years later, Paul McCartney tried to convince them not to ban \u201cHi, Hi, Hi.\u201d It seems that they objected not only to the very druggy title, but to the lyric \u201cI want to lie on the bed/Get you ready for my body gun.\u201d Paul straight-facedly tried to convince them that the lyric was \u201cpolygon\u201d and gave some total BS spiel about cubism or something. It didn\u2019t work\u2014they banned it anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean \u201cI'd love to turn you on\u201d, he meant that he'd like to encourage people to trip out on LSD. At the time drugs references were not especially subtle in songs and LSD, heroin, cannabis and other drugs were extremely common in the London and American music scene. The negativity around drug use wasn't as prevalent as it is today and people like Timothy Leary were writing that drug use would expand the mind and create a better society. Lennon was a very willing drug user and much of his writing st the time reflected this. Elsewhere in A Day in the Life Of, Paul sings about having a smoke and going into a dream, which is a cannabis reference. The glissando orchestration on the song was originally intended to be an orchestra \u201cfreaking out\u201d as Lennon imagined it. Fortunately George Martin knew an orchestra would be unlikely to do this and scored the new famous freak out section. ",
