            "answer_text": "Aerosmith - \u201cDream On\u201dPenned by lead singer Steven Tyler, this track served as the Aerosmith's initial breakout hit back in 1973. 2. Queen - \u201cThe Show Must Go On\u201d Even more than its overall uplifting message of carrying on through tough times, the fact that this song exists is a testament to man\u2019s ability to overcome. Recorded in 1990, many in Queen questioned whether Freddie Mercury was up to the challenge of singing. And he did that, despite he was dying.  3. The Beatles - \u201cLet It Be\u201d When you find yourself in times of trouble, mother Mary might not always come to you, but the immortal words of Paul McCartney will. While many believe that the 'Mary' the former Beatle is referring to in the song is the virgin mother of Christ, but it was actually his own departed mother, whose name was Mary who gave him his own bit of inspiration.
