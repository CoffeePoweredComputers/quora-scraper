            "answer_text": "It should be the same for any of the Android phones, but if you just open your music app of choice (stock app, Amazon mp3, Spotify, Pandora, Rdio, etc) and start listening to music, you can exit to the home screen or open up another app that's already open and use it. Your music will run in the background and you should be able to access your music either from a widget on your homescreen or by dragging down the top bar and accessing it from there. Edit: I see that you have tagged Youtube; you can't listen to music on Youtube and then exit to use another app or lock the screen. Think about it this way - Youtube is (originally) intended to be used to watch videos. If you do something that makes it so you're not watching the video, the video will stop. Thus, you can't watch Youtube videos and then switch to a different app. Edit: added \"Android\" for clarity; This also holds true for iPhones and I imagine it holds for Windows Phones as well. ",
