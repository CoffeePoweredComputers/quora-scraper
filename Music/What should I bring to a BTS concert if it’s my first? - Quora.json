            "answer_text": "Hello! [I hope you enjoy your concert! Remember to not be rude to other fans and have fun! Also use a small bag in case they check your stuff for safety] -First and foremost bring your phone in case you want to record and for safety reasons! You can never be too safe. Also you could take a portable charger with you so your phone does not run dead. -Of course bring your ticket with you so you don\u2019t waste your trip of going. - Bring your lightstick (if you have one!) or fan merch with you (banners, jackets, shirts etc.) You can take something that relates to your bias if you want. {Sometimes really nice fans give some banners out, look out for those people} -BRING WATER! You do not want to be dehydrated and pass out!! Also bring something to snack on in case you didn\u2019t eat anything before hand. (You will get really hungry and thirsty) You can take gum too if you would like -Check the weather for that day to see if you need to bring a rain jacket or if you need something for the cold. Bring an umbrella if the weather says rainy. -Bring money in case you want to buy something at the venue. Also bring your wallet or bag for items you know you need. (Like your id or other things) -Bring medicine for headaches or medicine you know you need to take. You can also take perfume/cologne or deodorant. -You can bring a mat to sit on for when you wait in line to go into the place. If i left anything out please let me know! These are only suggestions and things i would take! Be safe and have lots of fun :) ",

            "answer_text": "Phone With Fully Charged and Enough Space Fully charged phone with enough storage space for pics and videos. It might be a good idea to bring a charging doc. Having ear buds or even a speaker is also a good idea if you want to listen to music while waiting for the show to start. Ear Protection Ear protection! You must bring them if it is your first time . Concerts, especially kpop ones are very very loud. They sometimes give out earplugs at the concert, but its a good idea to bring them just in case. Bring Extra Money This is an absulute must. There will be three main reasons you need extra money: 1. For Merch 2. Emergencies 3. Food and drink (you wont be allowed to bring any inside, so you'll have to buy them inside) All of these reasons are important, so it goes without saying to do so.  Energy bar/drink 5 hour energy/ Energy bar. If you're gonna stay to see the group leave, get a hi touch, fansign, meet and greet, etc you dont want to be half asleep seeing your bias. A Small Backpack A small backpack or bag to hold your stuff in. Some venues have specific rules for what types of bags you can bring though, so make sure you research this before the show.  \u25c6 If you are a girl, bring a small pouch that has some pads, tampons, etc just in case you get your period. \u25c6 Headache Medicine and any other medicine you need to take. Hope this helps to my fellow readers. \u2014Deevin ",

So, since it\u2019s going to be your first time, you can take a camera with you which is fully charged so you can record most of it, and you can take you ARMY bomb with you if you have, but, if you don\u2019t have one, you can buy it outside the stadium because that\u2019s what I did when I went to the concert. And, if you want to make it more fun, you can bring a poster! Hope you enjoy your time at the BTS concert. ",
