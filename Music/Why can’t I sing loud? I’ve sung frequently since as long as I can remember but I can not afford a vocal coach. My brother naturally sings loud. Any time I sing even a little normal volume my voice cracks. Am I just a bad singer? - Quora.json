            "answer_text": "It\u2019s more likely that you have never really connected your vocal sounds with your own feelings and their sources in your body and soul! When you only use your voice in the detached ways that are speaking and musical singing, your natural voice - the one we display in our early baby and childhood years - fades into the distance required by \u201cgrowing up\u201d and by putting this gift into little boxes we call words or notes. Yes, it\u2019s OK to laugh and shout in certain defined situations - and not TOO loud or energetically or emotionally - otherwise you risk much approbation if your voice is heard in its full glory - what is otherwise know as \u201cSOUND\u201d. We need to realise and release the fact of the matter which is that without the sounding voice there can be no speech nor song! So get to know this primary material in its natural settings, of roaring, screaming, hooting, whispering\u2026. You don\u2019t have to \u201cgo wild\u201d to do this - just find a space where you won\u2019t disturb others - and give your more curious side a chance to hear what your very own sounding voice can actually do! Record it then listen back a day or two later in your own private company. PS I am not referring to what yobs and hooligans do at football games, or in smaller groups after excessive alcohol consumption\u2026 That is a destructive and negative use of the gift we have been given - that of making sound.

            "answer_text": "In order to give you a good answer I'd have to hear you sing and know your age. However, there are some things to think about. In a mature person the voice cracks when the technique is poor. Are you using good support? Are you starting your sound on your breath? Both of those things can be fixed pretty easily. Next, are you practicing good vocal hygiene? By that I mean: are you sleeping, exercising, eating, and hydrating properly? Are you yelling and screaming, or speaking loud without supporting your voice? If all of these things are in order, and you know how to correctly sing, there's one thing you might consider. It's an extreme, but more common than you might think. Is there some vocal paralysis? Is one of your cords unable to move towards the other one, to meet in the middle? You will need to see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor to determine this. There could be trauma or disease that's affecting things. Singing with a good church or community choir will help your singing, and you might find some help there. If not from the director, ask around. You'd be surprised at how many retired voice teachers or well-trained singers there are. One of them might be able to help you. See if you can barter for a couple of lessons - babysitting, cleaning house, etc. It will be worth it. ",
