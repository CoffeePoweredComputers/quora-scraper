            "answer_text": "It\u2019s increasingly hard to say what my favourite genre is. I listen to so many kinds of music. But I think there\u2019s a kind of \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201cvibe\u201d I\u2019m increasingly looking for in music. That doesn\u2019t really correspond to what we currently think of as \u201cgenre\u201d. But which does encompass much of the music that I fall passionately in love with. How can I characterise that spirit? Well, it\u2019s sort of spiritual, in some very general sense. It hints at, talks about, something beyond just music. Something mystical. Or religious. Or \u201cNew Agey\u201d. Or occult. Which is weird, because I\u2019m not religious, mystical or new agey at all. And I don\u2019t want or intend to be. But I still think this kind of mentality imbues music with a certain quality. A richness and \u201cseriousness\u201d that I want. At the same time, it\u2019s \u201clow key\u201d. Possibly lo-fi, amateurish, \u201coutsider\u201d. Not that it can\u2019t be technically skilful. But that isn\u2019t the point. What it isn\u2019t is dramatic. Or showy. It\u2019s not sturm und drang. Except when it is. It looks both backwards and forwards. All good music does this, of course. But this is a music where you can clearly hear the synthesis of folklore and tradition with experimentalism and futurism. It technological and organic. It can be made with samples, synthesizers, \u201creal instruments\u201d or just people chanting. Autotune. Or ancient flutes. It always sounds a bit organic. But it revels in the ability of technology to bring the unworldy and uncanny. It\u2019s melodic. Except when it isn\u2019t because it uses strange scales and harmonies. Or just white noise. It cuts across what you normally think of as \u201cgenre\u201d. I find it in jazz. In electronica. In psychedelic and prog and folk rock. In post-punk / industrial / darkwave / noise / vaporwave / witch house / hauntology. In ambient. In avant metal. And yet it\u2019s none of those things. Because 90% of the music in those genres, even great music that I also like, DOESN\u2019T have this quality without a name. I guess now you want to know what it sounds like, right? Well, it sounds like La Monte Young :  And Alice Coltrane :   And Jon Hassell :  And Bobby Beausoleil :  And the \u201cEngland\u2019s Hidden Reverse\u201d post-punk / industrial / apocalyptic folk scene, from Psychic TV :  to Current 93 :   through to Threshold Houseboys Choir :  It\u2019s in new-agey vaporwave / plunderphonic artists like Lifemod : H2, by LifeMod and Treasure Hunt : One Fungi, by Treasure Hunt And witch-house / contemporary darkwave acts like Sofia Reta :  INVESTMENT, by SOFIA RETA Ft. ZILLA, TOOTH, by SOFIA RETA and J J Brine :  And Hauntology :   and a bunch of other weird ethno- psychedelic- hypnagogic - cosmic unclassifiable Lucky Dragons (epilepsy warning, this video flashes) :  Arrington de Dionyso  Right the way through to the wonderful Giuseppe Iacono\u2019s \u201cStations of the Cross\u201d True mystic noise. So, yeah. Whatever the hell all that is, that\u2019s my favourite genre. You could, I guess, call all this \u201cpsychedelic\u201d at a pinch. But a hell of a lot that\u2019s also called psychedelic doesn\u2019t sound like this, and has a completely different spirit and isn\u2019t what I want to listen to at all. ",
