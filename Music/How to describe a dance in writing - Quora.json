            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s two examples of how not to do it. She stepped onto the floor and awed them all with her dancing. Under-descriptive. Dancing is such a physical and emotional movement that you have to balance those two in your writing and neither happened here. She gazed across the lacquered wooden tiles and, with a sudden burst of courage that she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d possessed, stepped onto the dance floor. As the thrumming rhythm of classical music whispered into her ears, she began to dance. Sliding her right foot back and the other one forward, she dropped low so that her dress brushed the ground, then sprang back up again, so quickly that she got whiplash. She threw her arms out and waved them from side to side, perfectly in tune with the beat, before jumping into the air. Her dress spun around her and for a moment it felt like she was flying \u2026 then the ground was beneath her again. That hurt as much to write as it did to read. I shouldn\u2019t be telling the reader each one of the movements that our dancer makes, unless I want an incredibly monotonous one-hundred page instruction manual on how to jump up and down and fling your hands in the air, like what the MC is doing here. Did you catch that? Possibly not; it sounded like it had taken an hour for her to dance when it was really just a split-second. When you write about someone dancing, make sure that it\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s okay to say the word \u201cdance.\u201d Not everything has to be a ten-page description \u2014 but not everything can be a one-word summary, either. Tie in enough of the surroundings to establish a mood and a sense of place. Lastly, make sure that the dance conveys what you want it to \u2014 if it\u2019s careless, make it sound careless. If it\u2019s more meaningful, make it sound like that. Let\u2019s try this again. She was dancing. Arms flailing in the sky above her, she whirled around and whooped her happiness into the sweat-stained air. Foot forward. Back. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d done this \u2014 why had she ever stopped? A hand grabbed hers and she was swung backward, dipped low, then soaring into the air, the flashing colors momentarily blinding her \u2026 she touched ground again and skidded to a smiling, breathless halt. That\u2019s a rough paragraph but it conveys what it needs to. It established a sense of place, action, and a connection with the dancer. Not under-descriptive or over-descriptive, just effective. Aaaand that\u2019s it. Hope it helped.  image credit: Google Images edit for image ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This can be really tricky. Are you needing to describe the whole thing, as in a how-to manual? If so, then do it very basically. Just like the Hokey-Pokey. Put your right foot in\u2026 But I don\u2019t think you are asking that. So I\u2019d like to caution you against \u201cover describing\u201d. Books are not movies. We can see every step of the Tango in a movie, but no one wants to read what every step is. If you write things like\u2026 \u201cHe moved his left foot backward in a smooth motion, sliding across the slick floor. She slid her right foot forward, chasing his retreating foot with hers, like a fox on the hunt. Dipping forward and looking into her eyes, his fingers tightened on her ribs as his left foot came forward again, surprising her foot and chasing it back. They stopped, toe to toe, and he pulled her hips in close to his. Threatening to brush his lips against hers, he looked to the left, and then to the right. She mimicked him, turning her head opposite. To the right, then to the left. He pushed her away as though she were too terrible, yet to wonderful, to be near, yet he held on to her left hand with his right, catching her as their arms pulled taut and spinning her out and away. Then he reeled her back in, unable to give her up. She fell into him, his strong arms wrapping her tight, protecting her before casting her out again.\u201d \u2026 you can get away with it for a paragraph, maybe two. Even with the nice similes and small details, it will soon become agony for a reader to get through. You have become a puppet master, forcing the reader to imagine each foot, each hand, each head motion exactly the way you want it to be. Readers don\u2019t like that. They like to use their imaginations. They want you to give them a coloring book outline and then hint at what colors they should use when they color it in with their imagination. To give them those subtle colors, only give sweeping descriptions, and add in the senses. Put in the emotions, even if they are only faux representative ones the describe the types of movement. The best thing you can do with a dance, is keep it short, at least in your description. Focus on the characters\u2019 feelings, fears, hopes and thoughts, and then come back for another quick description. If you took the dance I wrote above and stretched it out for the full dance, describing every move in detail, i guarantee even an editor will begin skipping over it as they read. Even if you don\u2019t give every little dance step, it will be too long and people will just let their eyes slide over it, looking for the place you stop describing and get back to the story. Don\u2019t be afraid to use a dance, just remember, readers are reading for the characters and their thoughts, feelings, and stories. The descriptions, backgrounds, clothes, etc. need to always take a back seat. I hope that helped. ",

Describe one step, then follow it up by describing how a character felt while they did it. Do they feel dizzy? Happy? Feel an adrenaline rush? Feel scared? Describe what they see. Does the room start to spin? Do they see the audience looking at them in awe? Describe the way their body moves. Is it effortless? Are they having trouble remembering the steps? Is any part of their body sore? Describe the atmosphere. Are they dancing at a party? What kind of music is playing in he background? What kind of beats does it have? Can they fee the bass thumping through their body? Is it a popular song? How many people are there? Are they dancing in a crowd, or alone on a stage? What are they wearing? Give meaning to the dance. It must be significant if you are introducing it in your text. Why is it significant? Is it about how liberated, happy and care free the character feels when they dance? Is it an intimate dance sequence the character shares with someone they love? Does the dance bring back memories? Is it demonstrating their hard work? Is it something they are doing to lose some steam? Do they have a purpose behind it? The dance scene is always more than just the movement of the character\u2019s body. It is significant to the plot in some way. You need to subtly highlight that significance. At most, if it isn\u2019t anything serious, it can be used to manipulate the reader\u2019s senses. Make them feel, hear, touch, smell, move, see, etc. Transport them. Make them feel as if they are dancing, or as if they are the audience and they are watching someone dance from up close. Writing the perfect atmosphere perfectly is the key. ",

            "answer_text": "Dance is a means to communicate your emotions without really saying anything much. An entire story on my blog revolves around dancing. Here it is:  NAACH MERI JAAN  NOW As the curtains rose, her heart accelerated. Centre-stage, she stood with her back arched and her hands stretched to the sky, as if in submission. The lights on the stage turned bright and the rhythm started to pulse into her. Her foot tapped to the steady beat. Back and forth, she swayed as the beat picked up pace. The curtains were swiftly rising now and her eyes scanned the mass of onlookers. Scrutinisers. Appraisers. Critics. And, five six seven eight. She breaks free. Yeh toh bas shuruwat hai. Yeh toh bas shuruwat hai. ________________________________________________________________________ THEN Lifting her dupatta over her head, she bent down to touch their feet. With a smile that did not reach her eyes, she meekly offered them tea. \u201cOf course, Nishita makes the best tea! That is practically all she does!\u201d Enraged, she walked into the kitchen again and set to work. The raging fuel heated the water and the molecules kicked the container furiously. As the tea leaves kissed the water, they brimmed on the surface, vigorously, like feet tapping on the floor. The swirls of the milk imparted such a grace to this everyday beverage. A white maiden seemed to spin around, crazy in love. The colours moved together, perfectly coordinated and thus ended this beautiful, beautiful routine. Why hadn\u2019t she seen this before? Jo,yeh badli dil ki taal hai. Ahah. yunhi, aaya ek sawaal hai. Ahah. ___________________________________________________________________________ NOW Her arms leave her body as the music grows louder. Her eyes are drunk on fire and her lips kiss the threshold of liberty as she dances her inhibitions away. Her fingers click to the right and click to the left. Her elbows gracefully tear through the air, in perfect rhyme with her feet, which trace a curve that no menace can surpass. She is for herself today. Her feet now hit the floor, in a boisterous cry for all that was denied. As one arm is outstretched, her waist jerks outward vivaciously. It seems to reject all the silent judgement that the world offered to her all this while. The other arm follows suit with yet another jerk of her slim waist. There is nothing that can calm her tempestuous gale. Her feet explore her arena as she slides across with poise. She stops at the end of the platform. She gazes at them all, the mass of onlookers. Scrutinisers. Appraisers. Critics. I\u2019m bulletproof, nothing to loose. Fire away, fire away. Shoot me down, but I won\u2019t fall I am titanium ! _____________________________________________________________________________ THEN She was not sure. This was not something they would approve of. She was making her own choices and, boy, would she pay for that. Royally. Still in two minds, she walked up to the counter. \u201cGood morning, ma\u2019am. Welcome to Groove Dance Academy.\u201d A blank stare was all Nishita could muster. Her questions were buried under the many layers of repression. A response could not make its way out. \u201cMy name is Shwetha. How can I help you?\u201d Wind escapes through her lips. Can she do this? Can she dream without having to ask? Her heartbeat resounds in her ears. Does she not owe this to herself? \u201cEnrol me,\u201d she finally says, \u201cI will dance to my own tunes now.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Nishita's head turned. Her torso turned. Her entire being turned to where the music was streaming from. She simply started walking. \u201cMa\u2019am, we need to fill this form.\u201d She did not so much as glance back at the registration desk. \u201cIf you could at least tell me your name and-\u201c The breathtaking face held its enigmatic smile as she broke into what could only be called an earthly manifestation of sacred grace. Lok-laj ki soch soch ke kyun hai aafat dali? nach le gali gali, le naam Ali Ali. Patakha guddi, oh, nashe mein udi jaaye re Haaye re. ______________________________________________________________________________ NOW The cadence is coursing through her veins extinguishing every trace of the unwanted blood that contaminated her insides. Because they don\u2019t rule her anymore. She does not spot them among the mass of onlookers. Scrutinisers. Appraisers. Critics. That\u2019s all right, though, she thinks. Her eyes close as she lifts her feet off the ground and dives head first onto the stage, as a mermaid would tear the water surface. Her hands gently caress the platform for only a moment, as she comes back, having rotated a full circle. Back on her feet now, she jiggles and shimmies. She electrifies the air with her rage and a hundred thousand fireflies ignite the atmosphere. She bursts into flames with every bob of her head, every jiggle of her shoulders, with every gyration of her hips. She sparkles on the stage tonight. Wings on me, wings on me When I was so heavy. Pour on a symphony. When I\u2019m low, low, low, low. ______________________________________________________________________________ THEN She was known as magic. She was the fireball. She was simply the best dancer they had ever produced. She brought with herself an energy and a force of rebellion. She charged their atmosphere. She had her own demons. Her demons tried to hold her back. They tried to suppress her, control her, demean her and hurt her time and time again. They had done so all her life. Years of being commanded now turned unapologetic. All the dark days came rushing back to her, when huddled in a dark room, she would hold on to dear life with fear. But she had now taken control of her life. She owed herself that much. She danced her grief away and embraced grace in an act of classic bravery. Euphoria colors everywhere, within a maze, oh, I find you It\u2019s an explosion of love, Happiness and we are dancing! Masquerades full of life Move- like nobody\u2019s watching Oho ho ho ho, naach meri jaan, naach. ______________________________________________________________________________ NOW Now, as she gyrates on the stage and spins around in fanatic circles, every jerk of her waist, every flick of her hair, every beat of her feet, ever shrug of her shoulder beckons to the world and says, I, oh I, oh I Got me feeling drunk and high- So high, so high. Then we shoot across the sky, then we shoot across the sky. ",

It\u2019s wonderful advice, so all that remains is to give an example. The second they started moving, most of his jitters melted in the joint swells of music and pleasure. She felt right in his arms, and he caught in hers, the steps flowing between them like sighs slipping against a silk pillow. His breaths, short and trembling, brushed her hair, and he saw the laughter glitter in her eyes. \u201cTell me I didn\u2019t do you a favour tonight,\u201d she whispered in his ear. Despite himself, he flashed her a rueful smile. \u201cYou wait until I step on all your toes.\u201d As has already been mentioned, the movement in a dance is a great parallel of the advancement of a plot. Using a dance to direct the flow of a story is an excellent use of a dance if you see no need to linger on the descriptive. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll try to keep this simple. You could either go completely literal, as some of the previous answers have stated, i.e describing each motion. I would recommend this at the beginning of the dance, but as the dance progresses I personally would switch to a metaphor or simile, such as: Their feet were like the raging waters of a waterfall: swift and vibrant, and full of energy. The couple's movements, while seemingly out of control, showed impeccable discipline and mastery. But that's just me! One last thing, try to convey a feeling while describing their motion. It really helps give the reader a mental image of the dance! ",

I closed my eyes and remembered what it felt like to be on the dance floor. I remembered the sounds, the smells, and the touch and visual sensations as vividly as I could. I got all the senses down on paper as best I could, and then I edited it down and rearranged it until it read well. I checked my impressions against the reactions of people in my writer's group to make sure it made sense. ",
