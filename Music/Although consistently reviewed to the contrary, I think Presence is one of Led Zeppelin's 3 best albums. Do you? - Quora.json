            "answer_text": "You know\u2026. Like you I don't give a really damn about reviews but I don't really have a top three. The top of my list has \"Zeppelin II\" and \"IV ZoSo\", after that it changes and is more individual song based. Sometimes it's \"Zep III\" and others it's number 1 but those change as well. I will say that \"Presence\" has one of my all time favorite Led Zeppelin peices on it, 'Achilles Last Stand'. That song is always at the top of my list of Zeppelin cuts along with 'Immigrant Song' and 'Black Dog'. I would say that it's a very different album for the band but then so was Zeppelin III. Hell so was \"Houses of the Holy\" when it came out\u2026 so really it's a mute point. Being a pretty old school guy I usually listen to entire albums or at least sides if on vinyl because that's the way alied Zeppelin is designed to be heard so I guess that means yeah, sometimes it one of my favorites of their albums.

            "answer_text": "You can put me squarely in the camp of Zeppelin fans that really enjoy this album. I've always thought Presence has an immediacy and punch that harkens back to their second album. The potent chemistry of the band is wonderfully alive here. There was a lot of tension and uncertainty within the group at the time this record was made, and that tension just explodes like a powderkeg off the grooves. Plant had a busted leg and was singing from a wheelchair but I always thought it gave his voice a kind of howling angst that still puts me in the mind of early Elvis. John Bonham is just all over Presence. Jesus. He's the thunder and lightning that ignites the energy of the band and spurs them on. Just listen to \u201cAchilles Last Stand\u201d. A blistering, galloping epic that retains the signature mystical vibe of Page's music without devolving into the pretensions of progressive rock. Jimmy once commented that they were toying with the idea of titling the album \u2018Loosely Tight \u2018, and the dynamic interplay of the band throughout this album gives a pretty good idea why they had that title in mind. True, there's nary a trace of acoustic guitar to be found in the mix but I think the album was deliberately conceived as a back to basics, bare bones display of the band's primal energy. I could never rank Zeppelin albums. It's just not possible for me. My opinion? Without getting into a song by song analysis: Presence is a stripped down, no nonsense album that displays a seasoned band, a great band whose spirit was still alive and well, playing like their fucking lives depended on it. Ass kickin rock album. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d give it top two just for having Achilles Last Stand and Tea For One would be there to back me up. I always loved Presence. I can\u2019t say any of their albums were their best. I would put Houses of the Holy on the bottom half tier. I\u2019d easily put Coda as a don\u2019t count. But, if it had to be there it would be last. I\u2019d put Song Remains The Same in my desert island selections with regret that I could only bring one Zep. If there was room for more Zeppelin, I\u2019d have trouble choosing between IV, III, and Physical Graffiti. In the end I\u2019d probably go with Physical Graffiti. I guess that leaves it at Song Remains the Same, Presence, and Physical. IMO  ",

But I would rank four songs from Presence pretty high (if I were to rank Led Zeppelin\u2019s catalogue), namely \u201cAchilles Last Stand\u201d, \u201cFor Your Life\u201d, \u201cNobody\u2019s Fault but Mine\u201d and \u201cHots on for Nowhere\u201d; which is more than half the album.

Plant\u2019s vocals seemed to lack some energy; perhaps singing while in a wheelchair will do that to you. He also claimed he felt very claustrophobic in the basement studio they were using. There is VERY little acoustic guitar. Almost everything written by Plant and Page. No Keyboards. Few songs that were performed live; exception to Achilles Last Stand which to me is nearly on par with Kashmir. For an album they wanted to push as being all four of them Presence, it was dominated by Page. As an album if very good but as a work by a band, it wasn\u2019t up to their typical \u201cspirit\u201d ",

Similarly to LZ III before it or In Through The Out Door after it, fans either loved or hated it. ",
