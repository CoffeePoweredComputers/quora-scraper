            "answer_text": "Vibrato comes from two methods: forced, and unforced. Forced vibrato is easy; you\u2019ve done it a million times. Everyone who has done the \u201cTarzan yell\u201d is forcing vibrato. I tell you about this other kind so you know when you\u2019re doing vibrato wrong (for the purposes of singing) and also understand how to better achieve natural vibrato by knowing what NOT to do. Unforced, or natural vibrato comes from a perfect relaxation of your vocal chords in a perfectly placed note. When your whole body is very relaxed as you sing, vibrato will happen. A couple of excercises: Spend five minutes breathing slowly in silence. Pay attention to how your vocal chords feel. Feel how relaxed they are when there is only breath going through them. Relax them to this state before you sing. It\u2019s each to clench your vocal chords; instantly getting to maximum relaxation takes practice.Practice singing in a very relaxed manner. Say a few words from a book in your normal speaking voice. Now sing them. Do you notice any added tension in your vocal chords? Then you have your target to practice on: when you can sing as relaxed as you speak, then you\u2019re on your way. Now work on every part of your body so it\u2019s relaxed and flows like water.Practice speaking as gently as you can. Not \u201cquietly\u201d, but \u201cgently\u201d, as if your words are a puff of smoke that will disappear at the slightest disturbance. This will help build control over your tone and volume.You don\u2019t make it happen by using your diaphramatic muscles to modulate the air mass through your vocal chords like in forced vibrato. A clean vibrato has to be nuanced out, like attracting that wild baby animal to you. Patiently, gently, coaxing, softly. Good luck! I know you can do it but you have to put the practice in! One final warning: it can be frustrating to develop your vibrato. You\u2019ll be working and working on it and it doesn\u2019t come\u2026 until one day it will. Be patient and do the work until then.

            "answer_text": "Your voice has just begun to mature. You won\u2019t hit your peak until at least 25 (coloratura soprano), or perhaps as late as forty. Caruso never sang Verdi\u2019s Otello because he refused to sing it before he was fifty, but died at forty-eight. You have a lot of time to mature. Increase your musical knowledge and repertory. ",
