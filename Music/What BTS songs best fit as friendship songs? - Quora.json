            "answer_text": "BTS writes their lyrics and through the years, some of them are about love, hate, family, and friendship. So I\u2019ll write down some BTS songs that are about friendship. (These are only their original songs, I won\u2019t include covers) Moving OnThis song has three speakers, the rap line (RM, Suga, and J-Hope) and this song is about moving through a new home together, reminiscing their memories\u2014 their worries, the disagreements, the teamwork, and how they became close to each other. This also a new beginning for someone who\u2019s moving in a new location. BeginThe speaker, Jungkook, is telling his story and seeing his brothers (the members) as his guide through his adolescence since he started young. They are the friends that are there for him that made him \u201cbegin\u201d realizing that he can dream big. Also, his brothers will cry with him and his shoulder to cry on. MikrokosmosThis song is about friends looking at the stars while being happy with each other that they are living in the same universe together. This is also dedicated to their fans, the ARMYs. Spring DayAlthough this is a sad song, this song is about missing a loved one, how they wanted their friend to stay a little longer with them but it\u2019s not possible to force them because they have changed or they are really gone. You Never Walk AloneIt\u2019s definitely obvious to the title that the song is about being with a friend and never letting them walk and face their trials alone. It means that they got each other, whether they succeed or failed. Good DayThis song is focused on friendship that is also a \u201cfamily\u201d. Quoting the \u201cOath of the Peach Garden\u201d, which means that though they have different surnames, they still unite as brothers. Their joy and pain that they share, the understanding between each other, the unchanging feeling that is still there (until now), and also the relationship they have. This is such a lively song so it\u2019s a must listen. FriendsThis song is about the soulmate\u2019s friendship: Jimin and V. Starting from going in the same school, fighting about food, giving each other gifts, making promises, and referring to each other as \u201csoul mates\u201d, this is definitely a song you can recommend to your best friend. Here are some BTS pictures for a happy day :)     ",

            "answer_text": "BTS has a lot of songs that talk about friendship, and some are more than friendship and it is about love. These are some songs I think it is to do with friendship: Spring day: the lyrics is about missing someone, and it talks about how they are hopefully going to meet when spring comes. It also talks about how they tried to forget about that person, but they can\u2019t. The song ends with lyrics about eventually meeting them soon. Lyrics from song: \u2018You know it all, you\u2019re my best friend\u2019 or there is this bit in the middle where Namjoon goes \u2018friend\u2019. Home: it talks about how everywhere is their \u2018home\u2019 as long as they have one another. However, if they don\u2019t have one another they feel weird, lost, etc. Lyrics from the song: \u201cas long as you are here everywhere is my home\u201d Good day: for sure this is one as well, and the lyrics says that you won\u2019t be alone and they\u2019ll be by your side always. It talks about tomorrow being a better day, and they can laugh with each other and lean on each other. This talks about true friendship. Lyrics from song: \u201cMy friend don\u2019t be afraid\u201d \u201cyou can lean on me, lay on me\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be by your side, we\u2019ll be ok\u201d \u201cwe may argue sometimes, but we make up quickly\u201d Begin: this is Jungkook\u2019s solo in the wings album. He is very grateful of the other members for bringing him out of his shell and he\u2019s admitting to them that his one weakness, the one time he\u2019s in pain, is when they are in pain. Lyrics from song: \u201cI feel like dying when my brother is sad\u201d \u201cYou make me begin\u201d Mikrokosmos: this is about how everyone shines in different ways, and the lyrics is about love. Lyrics from song: \u201cYou got me, I dream of you and I got you\u201d \u201cThat darkness is not moonlight, it's us\u201d Hope this helps~~ ",
