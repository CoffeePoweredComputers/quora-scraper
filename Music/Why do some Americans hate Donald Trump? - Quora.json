            "answer_text": "Well, not all Americans hate Donald Trump. I am reluctant to use the word hate, but it is safe to say that I do not like him and I certainly do not respect him. I can only tell you why I don\u2019t like or respect him, but I think it is fair to say a number of people would agree with me. Everyone has different ideas of what it means to be a decent human being, but I think there some fundamental human behaviors that most people expect of one another as they become adults. Donald Trump does not meet the expectations for accepted behaviors that I would expect to see in people that have reached maturity, say 25 years old. For example, some people try to excuse his behavior when he was recorded saying that \u201call you have to do is grab their pussy\u201d. They will say that was a long time ago and it should be forgotten. When Donald Trump said that, he was 61 years old. A 61-year-old man is way too old to be excused for being that vulgar. Aside from being vulgar, that comment says volumes about how he feels about women. They are there for his leisure and they will allow a man to do anything to them if that man is wealthy. A more recent example of his continued disregard and lack of respect for women was made clear when he commented on the appearance of Carly Fiorina during the course of campaigning for the 2016 election. His wife, Melania, was pregnant with their child Barron when he paid Stormy Daniels to have sex with him. At a South Carolina campaign rally, Donald Trump mocked a New York Times reporter. Worse yet, he tried to deny it in spite of the fact it was recorded. Donald Trump Criticized for Mocking Disabled Reporter In August of 2017, Neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia where a young woman, Heather Heyer, was mowed down and killed by one them. Following riots, Mr. Trump made it clear that there were both \u201cgood\u201d Neo-Nazis and good anti-Nazi protestors in Charlottesville that day. It is as if Mr. Trump is so fearful of losing a single vote from his base, he is willing to come off as a man who has never in his life been told about the atrocities of the Nazis before and during WW II. CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times have documented in excess of 3000 lies Donald Trump has told since he took office. Just in the last few days, he lied about not being able to stop separating parents and their children at the border. Until he learned that even the Republicans in Congress were turning on him, he did not back down. I have often wondered if Donald Trump is a congenital liar. There\u2019s more..but the bottom line for me is. he is a man without an ounce of character and I further believe that he does not have the capacity to empathize. In my opinion, Donald Trump\u2019s very deep character flaws make him unfit to serve as the President. I don\u2019t support many of Trump\u2019s policies, but we have had presidents in the past whose policies I did not support while still respecting the man and the office. Donald Trump has reduced the eminence of the office of the Presidency while also reducing the world\u2019s view of the United States as a model for decency and commitment to principled policy and behaviors.

            "answer_text": "Why do Americans hate Donald Trump Is it solely because he is rich?  If only it were that simple. I am an American, and while I am not a billionaire, or even a millionaire, I have friends and relatives who are very wealthy, and I do not envy them or hate them because of their wealth. I can also point out all sorts of wealthy people I don't know but admire because they earned their wealth. As far as someone who inherits their wealth and is able to hold onto it, I admire most of them as well, and I spend a lot of time reflecting on what I would do/will do once I achieve greater levels of wealth, inherit greater levels of wealth, or simply win the lottery. In sum, there's nothing inherently wrong with being wealthy, and there's nothing wrong with wealthy people expecting other people to earn their own keep and/or pay their own way. My problem with Donald Trump is not his wealth, but his absolute lack of personal substance. Until Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, I never really took him all that seriously. During the 2012 campaign cycle, he \"bet the farm\" and lost by championing the conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in Hawaii. I distinctly remember President Obama putting Trump in his place at the White House Correspondent's Dinner during the 2012 election cycle, trumping Trump's hopes of being taken seriously as a contender for the Republican Nominee. But in four short years, Trump rehabilitated his public image enough to \"fool some of the people all of the time.\" Speaking of betting the farm, when Donald made his infamous remark asserting that Mexican immigrants are rapists, with the qualification that \"some are presumably good people,\" or words to that effect, I fully expected his 2016 presidential campaign to go down in flames right then and there. However, after a few days, it became clear that Trump had found an issue that racist, nationalist, xenophobes were willing to rally behind, as well as a handful of otherwise decent people who were willing to sacrifice their dignity and intelligence in favor of their opposition to illegal immigration. And with each news cycle, Trump has been able to lower the bar further and further, convincing some of the most distinguished Republican politicians to goon it up right along with him. Trump brings nothing to the table. He is a litigious and mediocre business man, at best, who sees no problem with declaring bankruptcy when his business ventures fail, leaving other people holding the bag. And he knows next to nothing about the divisive issues he champions, other than how to successfully rouse the rabble. I'd rather have Sarah Palin as President. She may not be the best informed politician, but she ran a much cleaner campaign as John McCain's running mate than Donald Trump has run in the Republican Primaries. Of course, not all of Trump's supporters are low information voters, and this is perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Trump's campaign, that so many otherwise decent and intelligent people are buying into his rhetoric. They quickly forget all of the cheap shots he has leveled at his opponents. On this note, I lost all the respect and admiration that I once had for billionaires Carl Icahn and Mark Cuban when they came out in support of Donald Trump and praised Trump's abrasive, contentious, and boorish personal style. As I write this, the most recent controversy involving Donald Trump is his claim that United States District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is biased against Trump because Curiel's parents are naturalized United States Citizens who immigrated (legally) from Mexico. As someone who can trace his American genealogy back to Sarah Rappalje, the first European child born in New Amsterdam, I am pretty certain that I have no Mexican heritage, but I do have ancestors who emigrated from Europe just before the Civil War as well as at least one who apparently came to America unwillingly aboard a slave ship from Africa over 200 years ago. If I were a federal judge, would I have to recuse myself from a case involving Donald Trump because my great, great, great grandmother was an African American? If so, I guess #IAmGonzaloCuriel . ",
