            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat song makes you immediately change the radio station?\u201d Well, I can tell you, back in the 1990s, the one song that used to get me to change the dial faster than anything else was \u201cAchy Breaky Heart.\u201d If you\u2019ve never heard it, you\u2019re blessed. It was off of \u201cSome Gave All,\u201d so I thought it would be something different. We\u2019re talking the FIRST song I heard back here, in 1992, that was three minutes and 22 seconds of hell. Worse, it was a HIT. I have no idea how many copies were sold, but I swear I heard it once for every copy. How could it get worse? Some radio station decided to play it 24 hours a day for an entire weekend, starting on Friday morning and didn\u2019t stop until Monday morning. Over and over again, day and night, that was ALL they played. So, I made it thought without suicide, but barely. Jeez. Now, a lot of people complain about Disco. That\u2019s a blessing to me. In fact, there are only two genres that I can\u2019t take too well. One, the old Country and Western crap. You know, the dog died, wife left, lost the job, and all that depressing stuff. Thankfully, most of that is dead today. I hear it only when I go to bars (Country and Western no less). I usually just insert ear plugs and lip read people talking to me. It\u2019s the only place where the Confederate Flag isn\u2019t hated. But, the one that replaced it? It started just as the Disco craze was dying, with a well known song called \u201cRappers Delight.\u201d It\u2019s older, of course, but this brought it from the underground scene to the monster it is today. Gods, what horror. When rap comes on, there is a 99.9999999% chance that I will turn it. There are only a handful of songs that I like in this genre, and they are OLD ones. But, there IS one that I detest. Much more than turning the station. I cut the radio off. What it is?  ",

            "answer_text": "George Ezra - Shotgun The Passenger, Born to be Wild, Don't Stop Me Now, Live Wire (Motley Crue) etc. Those songs about going, going anywhere, fast paced style. These are the songs you want to listen to regarding driving and pissing off somewhere and enjoying the ride. Shotgun on the other hand tries to be but it's got no backbone, no substance in it. Ezra sounds bored and I feel if he sped the song up and threw a solo in there me and my boy Ezra might be fine. It needs a kick, it just needs a little caffeine and a shot of vodka. He doesn't match what he's trying to portray and I get that, he's too squeaky clean to push his limits. You can argue it's supposed to be a relaxing drive, but why does the chorus try being something it's not? Turn it off and throw something I can truly rock out to. Christina Petri - Jar of Hearts. When this came out i disliked it then and hate it now. It sounds like a whip in slow motion, just a tearing painful experience and it just keeps getting worse as it goes on. You might think I'm somewhat offended by the music video for being a bit haunting, but no. My gripe isn't with the video it's with that shit song. It's one of those fucking ones were it's meant to be deeper than it actually is. Perri sings like she's banged her small toe on a piece of oak furniture and I'm already screaming at the radio. It just gets on my nerves. Katy Perry - Fireworks I don't hate this song but my business teacher fucked this up. In class when we finished an assignment he played a song, only it was the same song, have a guess. Can you imagine spending two hours listening to this shite on repeat? Maybe you have but I had no choice in it. The cruelest part was when I completed my assignment, it felt like a firing squad of the mind. Any Ed Sheeran song he goes on about drinking and picking up girls Ed I love ya boy but please stop. You sound like you're having an acoustic rap and not a good one at that. Behave. ",
