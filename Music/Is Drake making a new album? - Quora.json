            "answer_text": "More Life is the latest album by Drake. It just came out March 18, 2017.  Since that was less than a month ago, it would be unlikely (but still possible) he is already working on another. Usually, artists will release an album and then promote its music so they can sell tickets to shows. It's at these shows where the real money is made. So, with a new album on the streets, its more likely he'll be on tour rather than making a new album, right away. It is not unlikely for artists to find inspiration on tour and write some songs while on the road. It's an interesting question you've asked. I'm wondering what prompted it. Did you hear something about a second album already on the horizon? ",
