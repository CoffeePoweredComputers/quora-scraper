            "answer_text": "Not all their songs, but a vast majority were written by the band. The first single was the Kink\u2019s song You Really Got Me. The other songs on the first album were originals and the album sold 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. The second album also had one cover song, but the two singles off the album were originals. The fifth album had 3-4 covers, such as Pretty Woman and Dancing in the Street. But over 90% of the songs on the first 6 albums were originals. The sixth album was 1984, had all original songs, including the three singles Jump, Panama and Hit for the Teacher. David Lee Roth seemed to enjoy doing covers. He left after the 6th album. The four studio albums with Sammy Hagar on vocals contained all original songs. So it\u2019s easy to see that a vast majority of Van Halen songs were originals. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to Wikipedia, search for Van Halen. You will find this: Van Halen - Wikipedia Scroll down to the part \u201cDiscography\u201d and click on any of the albums listed. You will come to the Wikipedia-page of said album. There, please scroll down to the part \u201cTrack Listing.\u201d You will read this (or something similar, depending on the lineup of the time of the songwriting): \u201cAll tracks written by Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth and Michael Anthony, except where noted.\u201d And there are only a few other songs noted to be composed by others. So the answer is Yes, Van Halen did write their own song material. BTW, you can try to find the answer to such obviously easy-to-answer question with similar strategies as described above. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they did. With the exception of about 8 cover songs on 3 of their 12 studio albums, they wrote every other song, which works out to be roughly 95% of their released songs were written by them. Usually, Eddie wrote all of the music, while the VH singers wrote the lyrics and arranged the harmonies in the songs. For most of their albums, all 4 members got equal songwriting credit. ",
