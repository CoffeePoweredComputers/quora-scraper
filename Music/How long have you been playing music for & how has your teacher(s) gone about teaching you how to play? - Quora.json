            "answer_text": "I have played Viola for six and a half years, but I\u2019ve only had private lessons for two and a half. My first teacher ( who I was with for about a year and a half) started me out on solo music, because I needed it for an audition. Using this, she corrected my posture, and my left hand and right hand (bow hand) positions, which needed minor adjustments. She also taught me my first three octave scale, which was a C major scale. After my audition, she sold us my first scales exercise book which covered A major to E flat major and their minor counterparts and harmonic and melodic scales. I also started working on a book with solos. She sold me some method books too, but we didn\u2019t use them much (if at all). Something else we worked on constantly was the thumb position in my left hand, because I often had it too high, and I tended to not move it when I shifted. Also, my vibrato, according to her, was not quite vibrato (it was finger vibrato but not quite finger vibrato) so she had me work on arm vibrato. The last lesson I had with her, I finally got it down. When I switched to my current teacher, he gave me a new way to play the three octave C major scale, then had me practice slurring the notes. First two at a time, then three, then four, six, eight, twelve, and finally 24, which I still have trouble with. He also had me work on the solo book I was currently on, but he let me move on faster, so he gave me two other solo books to work on. He also told me to buy a specific method book, which I have used a lot. This happened for several months, until I had to practice music for a competition. So the past several months I\u2019ve been practicing a bach quartet, and Romanze by Max Bruch. Currently, I am working on the Brahms Sonata in F minor for viola. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been playing music for almost 40 years at this point. I\u2019ve been playing it seriously for 25 years. I did some school music when I was a kid, but I quit after middle school. I took a year of jazz theory in college and some guitar lessons, but otherwise I was entirely self-taught until I got to grad school in my mid 30s. Even then, I mostly learned about music technology and production; I\u2019ve continued to substantially self-teach everything else. ",
