            "answer_text": "This usually depends on each individual radio station\u2019s management and/or owners. The reason behind that is that their license comes up for renewal on a regular basis, and if they have any complaints to the FCC due to content, the FCC may choose not to renew the license. What plays on one particular station may not play on another station. In my experience any song with blatant foul language is not radio friendly. In this day and age, it seems that an overwhelming amount of pop/rap/hip-hop songs have questionable or foul language in the lyrics. Some of these songs, just to garner air-play, will release a \u201cradio edit\u201d where either a bleep, a blank space or an instrumental flourish (such as a record scratch or a guitar riff) may be mixed into the tune in place of the profanity, thus making it \u201cplayable.\u201d Also songs with questionable themes like \u201ckilling cops\u201d or \u201cslapping Hos\u201d are usually not \u201cradio friendly.\u201d Those types of songs will rarely if ever get air-play even on radio stations that will occasionally let a minor curse word slip by. Most radio stations don\u2019t want to deal with the possible problems that these types of songs can present. In one instance, the Dixie Chicks (a female country group) made a derogatory remark about the U.S. President while they were on tour in another country. The entire country music industry in essence \u201cblack balled\u201d the group. No country stations would play their music because they inadvertently made country music fans mad. No fans=No plays. Also, songs with inappropriate titles (i.e., titles with profanity or titles that can be construed as offensive) and groups or bands that have risque names are almost always \u201cnot radio friendly.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Too long (anything much longer than about 4 minutes). Exceptions could be Don McLean\u2019s \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d or Iron Butterfly\u2019s \u201cInna-Gadda-Da-Vida,\u201d etc. (these songs also let the DJ have a long smoke/bathroom break if needed!)Too much cursing (a couple of bad words here and there can be \u201cbleeped\u201d out, but who want\u2019s to hear one long bleep or a song with so many bleeps that it sounds like Morse Code?)Too strange sounding (academic or experimental songs from composers such as Morton Subotnick or Edgard Varese hardly ever get played even on college stations, while more conventional classical, jazz and folk pieces find airtime there)Questionable behavior by performers. For example, you never hear any Bill Cosby standup bits on the radio. (For some reason, Michael Jackson is immune, we hear his songs all the time).",

            "answer_text": "There are numerous answers to that, some involving music, others involving the shady goings-on of the radio business, and others involving the music industry directly. But here\u2019s a good example of a great song that was killed at radio for not being radio-friendly, in spite of it being a really good song. In 1965, The Beach Boys released a non-album single, \u201cThe Little Girl I Once Knew.\u201d It was part classic Beach Boys singalong, part production experiment. It\u2019s an amazing, wonderful song that\u2019s the sign of its creators becoming very mature, sophisticated, intelligent, wistful songwriters and producers. And it bombed. Why? The production is\u2026a bit of a mess. There are stops. Literal stops. Dead air. The arrangement is also a bit complex, a bit too swirly to be appreciated on AM radio. Thus, radio programmers said, \u201cno thanks,\u201d and it quickly disappeared.  (I\u2019m aware that the song did merely OK in the sales charts thanks to the band\u2019s overwhelming popularity, but it never really made an impact on radio and was quickly dropped from playlists, becoming all but forgotten, buried on budget best-ofd but never really featured as a song that became memorable save for the fact that it bombed.) Clarity of production is important, and it was a hard lesson for Brian Wilson\u2014who nowadays admits that the production sucked, that he half-assed it, it should have regulated it to a b-side or an album cut, and that he should have worked a little harder on it for a single release.
