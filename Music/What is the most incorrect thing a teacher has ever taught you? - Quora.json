            "answer_text": "In my senior year of college, my Evolutionary Biology teacher had a really cool fact to share with us that he just couldn't believe. It was so astounding that it was almost unbelievable, he stated. This fact about starfish was a true example of just how incredible nature is\u2026  Except it wasn't true at all. It couldn't be true. It wasn't logical. How a PhD evolutionary biologist couldn't figure this out is beyond me. My professor, eagerly shared with us that day that he had heard that \u201cevery time a starfish lays eggs, it lays more eggs than there are electrons in the Universe.\u201d I sat there confused for a split second, then raised my hand. But I immediately put my hand down when I realized that I wasn't asking for clarification. There was nothing to clarify; this was blatantly wrong. In case others in the class didn't immediately understand this, I didn't want to embarrass him through questioning it. Some of you may think it's harsh of me to criticize him for making this single illogical statement. I agree that this is a little harsh\u2014everybody says something dumb from time to time. But what really makes me forgive myself here is that my friend who took the class the following year told me that he told her class the same thing! This man has been repeating this illogical statement every year \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f For those of you who are less familiar with science, here's why his statement doesn't make sense: each egg contains trillions of atoms and each atom contains many electrons. How could each egg contain more electrons than there are in the universe if each egg contains more than one electron? Next, how could one individual cell contain more electrons than there are in the universe if that cell is located within the parameters of the universe and is not the only thing in the universe that contains electrons? Now, to be fair, star fish lay a lot of eggs, up to millions at a time![1] But this is no where near the quinvigintillions of electrons there are in the Universe.[2] Footnotes[1] Sea star | echinoderm[2] How Many Atoms Are There in the Universe? - Universe Today",

            "answer_text": "That not being patriotic was a crime and indicative of bad moral character. Mrs. B was my kindergarten teacher. An elderly white woman, she was old fashioned and a little quirky. For instance, there was this mask she kept on top of a bookshelf. I vaguely remember it as being red and yellow. She told us that the eyes of the mask glowed when we did something wrong, and that the eyes would turn something of a hauntingly bright orange. So ingrained was this in our minds - or at least, in mine - that I would check the mask every now and again to make sure I was in the clear. (Okay okay, so maybe that was good classroom management on her part. But still quirky nonetheless.) Anyways, back to the main course. The anti-patriotism incident, aka Mrs. B\u2019s expos\u00e9. It was some random morning in Mrs. B\u2019s class and the school was going to do the pledge of allegiance. We did not recite the pledge every morning. There was a pattern, like every Tuesday and Friday or something like that.  Just in case someone is reading this in the distant future, one in which the pledge is not widely known, allow me to share with you said pledge, which for the record I have no issue with: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" A voice comes over the intercom calling for the pledge. All students stand, place their right hand over their heart, and recite in choral fashion \u201cI pledge allegiance to the flag\u2026\u201d That is except for yours truly. I just stood there. And Mrs. B got OH. Fended. Now, I was in kindergarten. My parents had not spoken to me about patriotism one way or the other at this point. Me ignoring the pledge was not an act of defiance or \u201cwokeness\u201d. Quite contrary, I had actually zoned out and did not register that I was supposed to be doing something. Also, did I mention I was in kindergarten?  Unfortunately for me, Mrs. B wasn\u2019t having it regardless. She pulled me aside shortly after the pledge and questioned me about why I hadn\u2019t said the pledge. I faintly recall making up an answer to the effect of \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d Spoiler alert: that was the wrong answer. Mrs. B was of that Silent Generation/Baby Boomer age range where many Americans were legitimately concerned about communist threats to civil liberties on a national scale (and, to a lesser degree, an international scale). The pledge of allegiance was one of the primary American propaganda tools used to combat what came to be known as the \u201cRed Scare\u201d.  Many people took saying the pledge very, very seriously. To be fair, I cannot definitively prove that this is the reason for what she did. But part of me honestly thinks she thought she was exposing a \u201ccommie\u201d (communist) family. After a brief dressing down for my noncompliance, I was unceremoniously dismissed to the principal\u2019s office for punishment. I honestly thought I was in serious trouble!  There I had to explain the cause of my dismissal to the principal. As a teacher looking back on this incident, I can now see that the principal was as dumbfounded as I was. My parents later had a similar response. Mrs. B was tripping, for reasons that still remain ambiguous. (If I remember correctly, she did retire that year.) I was sent back to the classroom with no consequences, courtesy of our sensible administrator. From that point on, I always said the pledge of allegiance for the sole purpose of keeping Mrs. B satisfied and not getting another referral to the office. In return, she probably thought she\u2019d taught me a valuable lesson. And she did. Or rather, my principal and parents did. That the decision to be patriotic has nothing to do with one\u2019s character or overall decency as a person. And, that later on down the line, I would not repeat this same type of behavior when I became a teacher with students of my own. Thanks, Mrs. B. I salute you. Image Sources: Google ",
