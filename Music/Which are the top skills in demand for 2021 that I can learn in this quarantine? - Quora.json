For example, you must have surely come across the statistics regarding the most used/downloaded apps during Covid 19. Many of those were Ludo King and others as well. So thinking or implementing digitally like developing some sort of web/app can be effective enough in the coming times. Apart from it, making Sanitizers, masks, health and safety equipments or other wellness products can also be a reasonable investment in the upcoming period. This is because after due to this virus, sanitizer and mask sales have tremendously increased and will also continue ahead. As far as my knowledge is concerned, in the view of this pandemic, these two opportunities will be uprising in the coming days as well. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a Stay safe and healthy \ud83e\udd18 ",
