He\u2019s not a citizen, can\u2019t vote, and party membership would be pointless.He\u2019s had his lawyers demand that Trump stop playing his songs at his rallies. So have Neil Young, Prince\u2019s estate, The Rolling Stones, many others. Of course, Trump ignores them, whereas if you and I made a film and included \u201c1999\u201d in it, we would pay through the nose.Log cabin republicans notwithstanding, a large majority of the LGBTQ community are not in favor of a guy who\u2019s policies are set to strip people of their rights to be treated like human beings.",

            "answer_text": "No, and he\u2019s not a Democrat either. Sir Elton is a British citizen, and his politics reflect his views about his country: for example, he is not in favor of Brexit, and does not believe the UK should leave the European Union. He has also spent years advocating for policies that would be associated with liberals in the United States\u2014 gay rights, finding a cure for AIDS, etc. But he has not openly affiliated with either liberals of conservatives, nor have I heard him give any political speeches. He seems to think of himself first and foremost as a musician, and he tries to avoid getting involved with political battles. ",
