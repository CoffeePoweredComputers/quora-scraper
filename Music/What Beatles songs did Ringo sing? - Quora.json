He was the sole songwriter in two (numbers 10 and 11). Four were covers (nrs. 1, 3, 4, 5). He had nearly one song per album, on average (no song in \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d , \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\u201d and \u201cLet It Be\u201d issues) - two, only at the \u201cWhite Album\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Boys: The Shirelles cover. Awesome band performance, actually, one of my favorite Harrison guitar solos. He does two of them. (Guitar solos, not Shirelles.)I Want To Be Your Man. (John and Paul kind of take over for the chorus. Underrated song because it is relatively simple bundle of cliches but that is not always bad.)Matchbox. It\u2019s a song about a matchbox holding his clothes, messin\u2019 \u2019round his tree, getting his peaches and him being a little dog til your big dog comes, at which point she watches her puppy-dog run.Honey, Don\u2019t. Aww, rock on, George, one time for Ringo.Act Naturally. From Help! Well-done but still mehsville.What Goes On. Country-rock; nice harmonies and guitar solo: what Act Naturally should have been. Has co-writing credit.Yellow Submarine. An eerie Edgar Allen Poe-style story of a sea-faring man, born in Liverpool, who has an epiphany he is compelled to share with everyone, all of us, through Ringo: We all in fact, in actuality, live in a Yellow Submarine. Ringo proclaims that \u201cEvery One of Us Has all We Need\u201d, a clear prophecy of a future in which the Communist Utopia has come to pass, and \u201cThe Band Begins to Play\u201d, an image that evokes the horrors of a genocidal 20th century.The Beatles were the first band to do Edgar Allen Poe/Marxist/genocide stories: this fact is inarguable.With a Little Help from My Friends. He gets high with a little help from his friends. Ooh, the subversity of it all. A companion to Lou Reed\u2019s 67 classic \u201cHeroin.\"He probably sings co-lead on Flying.Don\u2019t Pass Me By. Country rock. Boring unless you are stoned. Sounds like he is playing the drums with a sledgehammer, which is cool. Stereo and mono mix differences in violin bit.Good Night. As lush as \"Long and Winding Road\u201d, only Paul doesn\u2019t bitch about it.Octopus\u2019s Garden. Totally sexual; obviously a song about going \u201cunder the sea\u201d, if you know what I mean. Features backing vocals by trippy, strobe-lit chipmunks.Carry That Weight: co-lead with George and Paul.\u201cShout!\u201dfrom Anthology 1. (co-lead: a little bit LOUDER now!)\u201cIf You\u2019ve Got Trouble\u201d from Anthology 2. A true piece of shit with good drumming and a biting guitar solo.",
