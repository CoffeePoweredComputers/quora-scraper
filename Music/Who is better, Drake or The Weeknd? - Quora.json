            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it's The Weeknd. And I've got MY justification. Drake, for me, is just simply overrated. Sure, he's put out good stuff - Take Care is a solid project with some real good music production, lyrics and FEELS but nothing that Drake has put out has made me feel the same way post that project. Again, that's me (I respect that it might be the other way around for others). The Weeknd, however, has been consistently putting out great projects one after the other. People might argue saying his new projects aren't as great as his former but I'd like to politely disagree. Sure, they're very different but it doesn't make them less greater or not good at all for that matter. They're great in their own right although they're very different from his works like Trilogy and Kiss Land but, when has Abel dropped two projects that sound anything alike? The Weeknd has evolved over the years, changing his style and beats but if you look in deep, you can still feel his original essence and roots within his latest works. And this is why The Weeknd is better than Drake. He has evolved, musically, sonically, as an artist. Not saying Drake hasn't but I don't think the evolution with him has happened in the same way. ",

            "answer_text": "Ahhhh good question I have never really thought about this. As with any music question it is really a matter of opinion. Also, it is kind of difficult to compare the two when they are not exactly in the same genre. That\u2019s not to say that they don\u2019t make music which intersects with one another stylistically though. Drake certainly has his R&B crooners and Pop singles, whereas The Weeknd will occasionally make a more Hip-Hop, rap-esque tune. But, I would say in general Drake tends to stay with the Hip-Hop/Rap sound, and The Weeknd mainly makes R&B or Pop music. I honestly love them both and it is hard for me to say who is better. As for right now I\u2019m just going to go with Drake because of the God\u2019s Plan video. It\u2019s a great video with a good message behind it and I appreciate Drake for bringing that in a time where hostility and negativity are so prominent. Although, to be honest I have definitely been listening to more of The Weeknd than Drake as of late (even though \u2018Look Alive\u2019 has been heavy in rotation). I can listen to Trilogy everyday\u2026 love that project(s). ",
