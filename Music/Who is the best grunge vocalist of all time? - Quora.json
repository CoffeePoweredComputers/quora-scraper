            "answer_text": "I would give that title to Layne Staley.   He had an amazing voice, one that, in my opinion, could rise the dead. His screams could come out scratchy and raw, or clean and powerful. He had plenty of variety to his voice and new how to use it in many different ways, all of which resulted in amazing listening experiences. Every single album shows unique aspects of Layne\u2019s voice. For instance, Facelift has Layne with really powerful vocals, Dirt has more gritty and grungy vocals, Jar of Flies has his harmonic side, and their self-titled (my personal favorite) has a unique aspect of how Layne can make his flat vocals unbelievable beautiful. I would dare say that Layne\u2019s voice was better than Kurt\u2019s without a doubt. Layne was one of the best Grunge vocalists, and in my personal opinion, the best out of them all. My favorite songs from the band that also show Layne\u2019s amazing vocals: We Die Young - FaceliftMan In The Box - FaceliftSea of Sorrow - FaceliftLove Hate Love - FaceliftRight Turn - SapDown In A Hole - DirtRooster - DirtWould - DirtMost all of Jar Of FliesGrind - Self-titledSludge Factory - Self-titledShame In You - Self-titledGod Am - Self-titledNothin\u2019 Song - Self-titledFrogs - Self-titled",
