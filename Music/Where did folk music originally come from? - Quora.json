            "answer_text": "The idea of \"folk music\" is a German notion from the mid nineteenth century. It came from people like the Grimm Brothers who were studying the stories of the \"folk\" or the peasants and poor people. The collecting of it seriously in the US did not begin until the late nineteenth century. James Francis Child at Harvard University is the best known of the academics to apply his attention to it. He focused only on the song lyrics from Great Britain as at the time white academics thought they were the only \"legitimate\" roots of American folk songs. They had slightly overlooked the contributions made by the African American population, a subject collected most seriously by John and Alan Lomax starting in the nineteen thirties.The fact is, people have been writing songs that end up being perceived as part of the folk repertoire ever since printing began. Broadsides, sheets with a single song printed on them and sold for a penny were popular in nineteenth century Britain. Stephen Foster began to write and sell printed music in the mid nineteenth century, soon followed by Henry Work, basing their creations on the melodies and feel of what they heard around them, but clearly influenced by the popularity of \"parlor ballads\" and art songs of the era.After recording technology became common at the beginning of the last century the way in which folk music was collected, copyrighted by collectors claiming it as their own and publishers looking for free money became the standard by which we came to recognize folk music in the current era.Woody Guthrie was influenced by the Carter Family and wrote many songs using preexisitng melodies, a practice copied freely by the young Bob Dylan.

            "answer_text": "First of all there was no one originator of folk music. All cultural traditions have some form of folk music. So, when you are asking about the \u2018originators\u2019 of folk music, to what cultural tradition do you refer? If one is thinking specifically about American folk music, the answer would be that this folk music is fed by many cultural traditions. In the early sixties in America there was a \u2018folk revival\u2019, which saw such folk luminaries as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers, the New Christie Minstrels, Harry Belafonte and Odette come to the fore. For the very young at the time these artists must have seem like the originators of a new form of music but of course they too were merely \u2018re-creators\u2019 of much older music. Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh traditional music were great contributors to this \u2018revival\u2019, as were Negro slave music sang in the cotton fields and Negro prisoner music sang on the chain gangs. Then there was \u2018Cajun\u2019 music of Louisiana which was of French Canadian origin out Acadia (Nova Scotia/New Brunswick) which in turn originated in France. Not to mention the Spanish sound via the exported folk music of Mexico. When one thinks of the long and varied lineage of folk music and the old music\u2019s transition to \u2018recreated music\u2019, a line out the movie \u2018Thoroughly Modern Millie\u201d comes to mind. \u201cEverything old is new again.\u201d ",
