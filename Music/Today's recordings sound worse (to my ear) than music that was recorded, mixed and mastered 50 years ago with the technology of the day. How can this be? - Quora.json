            "answer_text": "The answer is actually very simple because they do sound worse for a number of reasons I am not going to do a long answer because I don`t have the time. There is an article out there by a world renowned engineer lamenting the loudness war. Any musicians classical,folk rock etc use subtle changes in volume to bring light and shade to the music. Some years ago record executives ( not the musicians ) would insist that the record be compressed at matering to ensure even the quiet parts were at the same level as the louder parts bye bye expression etc. If you listen to recordings made in the 50`s and 60`s they were all done with all the musicians in the studio so you had to be able to play and sound good as well as blending in with the others. later on multi track 8 .16 and so on became available allowing parts to be recorded individually. Now all recording is done digitally and the amount of people who program all the instruments and layer them up is amazing. This is technology that allows things like autotune to make bad singers or players sound good. but just because you can buy an expensive instrument doesn`t make you a musician . But you can layer it up compress it down and end up with a wall of digital noise that is crap.Don`t get me wrong there are some artists out there that are doing great records today but the vast majority are processed to be a hit with what ever sound or songwriter is getting hits at the moment so they all end up sounding the same and it is then played on crap gear as an mp3 or whatever. Millons have been spent ensuring that the sound is loud and at full volume on any kind of earphones or radio etc ",

            "answer_text": "It is the music. This applies to a large part of what we get to hear today. There could be several reasons to this. One of them being that technology has largely liberalised what used to be extremely high performance levels and musicianship of musicians, that naturally resulted in a higher quality of music, as opposed to the technological advantages largely eliminating the need for good musicians for recording a song or an album. Anybody can leverage the technology to their advantage to sound better than they actually are, but it can not and does not essentially make the music any better than it is. Good studios were required to make good recordings and they weren\u2019t cheap. Nobody would book a studio for weeks at a stretch to record an album unless they were sure that the music was worth it and they had the musicians that could pull it off. Now, you can record an entire album at home and it doesn\u2019t really matter if you have ever mic\u2019d up a drum kit before or even if you have one, depending on the technology you are using. ",
