            "answer_text": "Hmm\u2026I\u2019ve never heard of there being such a thing as an \u201cEnglish pop band online audition\u201d here in Korea, and it\u2019s possible you might be narrowing the scope of your question to a category that doesn\u2019t exist. Kindly note that you didn\u2019t specify your instrument (or if it would be as a vocalist or even as a whole band audition), so it would make it all the more difficult to check if any of us here could be of assistance. What you are otherwise describing (if you remove the \u201conline\u201d and \u201cEnglish\u201d part) is what sort of happens day-in and day-out (on a casual basis) in the Hongdae / Mangwon-dong, and Yeonnam-dong neighborhoods of Western Seoul. And yes, even with foreigners involved. Admittedly, the question \u201cCan anyone tell me some English pop band online auditions?\u201d is loaded for a number of other reasons, and I will be upfront in mentioning that I know of no mainstream companies who would be interested in holding auditions for an \u201cEnglish pop band\u201d in the first place, nor why a business here would be interested in such outside of a talent search for a variety show that might includes foreigners, which feasibly could happen and is on par with the type of silly shows that are aired around the big holidays (Lunar New Year and Chuseok).  But note this first. If you don\u2019t already live in Korea I can\u2019t imagine why one would go through all the trouble to firstly find a way to reside here longterm and then pursue joining an \u201cEnglish pop band\u201d, since 95% of independent Korean bands in the first place can barely make enough money to get by, and Busker Busker may be the only one that had a non-Korean member and saw some considerable success (along with YB, categorically). Of course you might have a plan to study here (most convenient if at one of the major universities near Shinchon) and are musically inclined enough to get plugged in and connect with other musicians just for the heck of it. The truth is that band end up pooling funds to rent out studios for rehearsal and then get a free drink at the bar they play at. Getting signed beyond that by an independent managing label for both scheduled promotion and digital distribution of recorded material is less common than one may think, and is not something I\u2019d put my hopes on\u2026Especially since it\u2019s even less lucrative than 2nd rate mainstream K-pop groups (who have very limited promotional power), and money to get your material recored can be hard to come by. It\u2019s quite depressing, really. Once you\u2019re here. But if you\u2019re here and ready to jam, you\u2019ll soon find that most musicians in Seoul connect via message boards on mule-dot-com, but there still are a lot of dinosaurs in the system that post regularly at the clubs for auditions for parts, and a lot of ex-pats are active in the Hongdae scene as a result, mostly as English teachers who have time on their hands to rehearse and play out. That\u2019s the route I\u2019d suggest going if one were to come to Korea and want to pursue at least a band hobby: You need financial sustenance to keep you going while in an indie band. My story. The last really meaningful audition I had for a band in which all members did indeed speak English happened 15 years ago and turned out to be to be quite interesting, since the band I later joined was label mates with some that did extraordinarily well. And here they are.  The bands of Modern Life. Counterclockwise from upper left: Monni, Annyungbada, Izi, The Breathing, Daylight Modern Life was located in Cheongdam-dong and was run by the guy who made Wax a big pop-star in the early 2000s. He had a knack for hyping independent acts, and despite his poor production/mixing skills, he was a shrewd promoter and got the following bands/singers their start, some with a decent platform for success: Monni is one of a handful of independent pop bands that worked their way to success completely outside of mainstream promotion, easily in the top 1% of succeeding cases from an independent background. Annyungbada has consistently done well and was brought into the spotlight after one of their singles got a clever spot on SNL Korea.[1] Izi was a decent rock band that had a single mainstream hit ballad (\uc751\uae09\uc2e4) and now each member does their own thing, a few of them quite successfully. The Breathing had a string of independent releases, but called it quits after the lead singer had been diagnosed with MS. Daylight\u2019s major promotional days were in the mid-2000s, and she\u2019s moved on since. However, the big thing I want to focus on in this answer is that both Monni and Annyungbada found their success primarily from their independently produced content and sheer hard work for nearly a decade each. Endurance through incredibly hard times is what made them eventual stars, and I think it would be even tougher for a non-native to hang in there and make do. There\u2019s less money in the independent scene, and it\u2019s tougher to succeed all the more outside of having mainstream promotional support (which will also steer your profits all the more away from your pockets). And if one doesn\u2019t have decent Korean skills, I can\u2019t imagine it getting any easier. I was a part of The Breathing (yes, an \u201cEnglish-speaking pop band\u201d) from 2006 - 2011 or so, and leaders (int\u2019l couple) Mitch and Sunny are their still some of my dearest of friends who have moved on to quieter family life in the suburbs. We all recall the old days with much joy amidst the frustration, and honestly I\u2019m glad that they did a good bit better after I had to move one, despite it not being especially lucrative. They have a few really good tunes, among many recorded:   Be realistic. Granted, every guitar-toting foreigner who saw the success of Busker Busker not even a decade ago has hoped to recreate such a success from the Hongdae scene all the way to a mainstream explosion, but unless you know the backstory of how they as well were horribly squeezed dry along the way and are cool with the chances of yourself meeting such a fate, it\u2019s pretty much just wishful thinking. Everyone looks cool in music videos, and their (final) success is not the norm.   My advice: Come to Korea and enjoy playing in a band on the side if you have time outside of the workplace, even if your Korean language skills are poor. Doing it as a hobby will be a decent stress reliever and you\u2019ll meet some great folks, to be sure. But I wouldn\u2019t place my ambitions in much more than that.
