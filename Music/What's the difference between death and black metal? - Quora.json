            "answer_text": "Niko On's answer is definitely the most precise, going into the actual sound of black metal and death metal instead of rambling about the origins and lyrical themes. Generalising Death Metal as a genre that writes about death, and black metal as a genre that writes about satan is just stereotyping the genres, genres which have both formed a large amount of subgenres of their own (though death metal definitely leads black metal in no of subgenres), and hence a very diversified sound can be found in both genres. Coming back to the sound -  Vocals - Traditionally death metal employs death growls, whereas black metal uses shrieks. Various techniques are used to execute both the afforementioned vocal styles, but those are the styles employed in the pure death and black metal genres respectively. Death metal without harsh vocals is absolutely impossible. Death Metal without any sort of growling emplyed at all, will not be called Death Metal. Black Metal can take liberties with the vocal techniques used.  Drums - Both Death Metal and Black Metal employ blast beats, but Black Metal focuses more on the hats, Death Metal focuses more on the snare and bass. Guitars - Death Metal guitars are usually downtuned. Black Metal guitars are NEVER EVER downtuned (without exception) Black Metal relies heavily primarily on high pitch tremolo riffs interspersed with low pitched tremolo riffs to make the \"atmosphere\" that everyone talks about. Death Metal, depending on the subgenre may use more chugging, or slams, or straight up thrash riffs, low pitched tremolos are also found but high pitched tremolo melodies, like that in black metal are very very rare. Lot more reverb on guitars in black metal btw. Bands like Deathspell Omega may also use a clean???? guitar with reverb and make a very unique sound. Death Metal will usually have a rather distorted tone with the already metioned downtuning. Bass - Nobody gives a shit about bass in Black Metal. Seriously. Production - No, all black metal is not produced in a horrible fashion, that is only for the second wave bands, many modern black metal bands, and even old school bands use modern techniques for production. Even death metal bands, to this day use awful production, sometimes intentionally, sometimes due to lack of funds. Lyrical themes - No. Lyrical themes do not decide whether a band is black metal or death metal. There are black metal bands singing about God. They're still playing black metal. There are death metal bands singing about Satan. They're still called Deicide... oops, Death Metal. Music genres are not limited by lyrical themes of all things. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah\u2026. Such a simple question with as many answers as there are fans. Personally, I\u2019ve been a metalhead my entire life. I\u2019ve watched intently as metal evolved from literally pissed off kids all the way to virtuosos with doctorates in music LITERALLY composing songs on sheet music. All of the previous answers have went into insane amounts of \u201cdetail\u201d that really is just postulating to sound \u201cin the know\u201d. Jesus people? Did the dude ask for a friggin\u2019 essay or treatise on the standard definition of music? Death metal and black metal can be, and usually are, the same thing. They\u2019re BOTH cupcakes. They BOTH have green icing. They\u2019re made from the EXACT same ingredients. One has sprinkles. That\u2019s IT. YOU define what\u2019s BLACK metal or what\u2019s DEATH metal. Simply as long as it\u2019s METAL. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO PREVIOUSLY REPLIED: You all fed this dude a whole bunch of opinions. Most of you weren\u2019t WRONG per se, you just obfuscated your answers with a lot of widespread assumptions\u2026. That ends TODAY. Death metal is literally named after the band Death and the ENTIRE Floridian death metal scene. It\u2019s because of the band DEATH, so many of us get to always discover AWESOME new music. The Swedes heard what was happening, because \u2018Murca don\u2019t play no games, and injected a SHIT TRUCK of melody into better structured songs, BUT NOT AT FIRST. No one band really stands out, hence MELODIC DEATH METAL. Black metal is LITERALLY named after an album released by Venom in 1982(? EARLY 80s for SURE) by the name of\u2026. BLACK metal\u2026. OMFG!?!? And the album cover is a, what? INVERTED PENTAGRAM WITH A BAPHOMET HEAD? The vast majority of black metal bands are really, really shitty musicians who hide under 56,000 layers of atmosphere and utter rubbish for production to make that KVLT sound. ONE pioneering black metal band was Dissection FROM SWEDEN!?!? Ain\u2019t black metal supposed to be like Norway and snow and cold? Yes, it\u2019s a stereotype for a reason. However, they could actually play and wrote great music. Storm of the Light\u2019s Bane is a stone cold classic. Most people label them melodic death metal when, according to \u201cstandard\u201d definition, they\u2019re as black as you can get. The brains of the band, Jon Nodeveit(?) KILLED HIMSELF IN THE NAME OF SATAN. After doing like 20 years for KILLING someone else. There\u2019s the ONLY difference. How many grind bands are there? How many frickin\u2019 subgenres of grind ARE THERE!?!? Death metal will not kill you, black metal will. Black metal doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Black metal will destroy you. It\u2019s GENUINELY menacing. If it doesn\u2019t have that air of menance, it\u2019s not black metal. GENUINE menance, not \u201cattitude\u201d, but malicious intent. It always could go the Satyricon route and just LITERALLY RAPE you. Either way, it\u2019s not a good time to be on the receiving end\u2026 I\u2019ve got my favorites all across the board, name it and I\u2019ll tell you more than you ever thought you could know about things you assume you\u2019re well versed in. Come at me for being truthful. ",
