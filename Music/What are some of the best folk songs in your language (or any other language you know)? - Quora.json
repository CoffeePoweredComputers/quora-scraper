            "answer_text": "Sorry for late answer. One of my favourite folk song is Bono Maryam (Daughter Maryam). It is one of the songs of early nineteenth century in which the story of a girl, named Maryam, married to a dumb and deaf man of a poor family, is narrated. It was the era of political suppression and turmoil, Baltis had lost power and Dogra forces invaded Skardu, the capital of Baltistan. The cruel king of Kashmir made it compulsory to pay tribute in form of girls. Unfortunately, the ill-fated girl was chosen to send to Dogra Raj as a tribute. Her in-laws were given handsome money, so they did not resist. Her husband protested against the base act, but all in vain. She was taken to Kashmir through Burge Nullah. She sung this song to a shepherd, who transmitted her feelings and the complaints to the ruler of the time and people of Skardu. Her song stirred the emotions and the feelings of Baltis, and a strongsense of patriotism spread in the entire region. The ruler sent forces to bring her back to her home town. Dogra forces were defeated at the hand of Baltis, and not only Bono Maryam was brought back but Baltis also refused to pay any kind of tribute in future. As I remembered, another account says that daughter Maryam prayed to God to save her from going in hands of infidels, and in the way to Kashmir she became a stone figurine. Bono Maryam (Daughter Maryam) I see three persons at Ghuri Changra; one of them must be mydeaf and dumb husband and the others my father and motherin-laws; If you meet my deaf and dumb husband, tell him I am goingaway with tears shedding; if you meet my father and mother inlaws tell them that I am going away happily; Bono Maryam is being carried off beyond Burge (KoshmaraNullah);I shall be in the kingdom of Kashmir spinning silk thread,playing with silk cloth; but there was no, no wazir and no publicin Skardu; for no one raised his finger in protest; no one said\u2018she should not be sent, she should not be sent\u2019. As folksongs reflect the cultural accounts of any nation, so the song Khari Sultan Cho, depicts cultural and social aspects of Baltistan. Khari Sultan Cho is the plea of an orphan to the king of Kargil (Purig), Kharmang. It is a Balti ritual that whenever there is a marriage in royal family, everyone in the state is invited. Khari Sultan Cho was the king of Kargil during seventeenth century. At his marriage ceremony, every individual of the state was gathered in front of king\u2019s palace to witness the event, but the orphan girl could not come because her step-mother asked her to graze the animals in mountains. In Baltistan, people go to the upper fields which are located between mountains. Khari Sultan Cho was known for his kindness and soft-heartedness in the region; the orphan girl expressed her emotions in suchwords. This is divided into two parts:Khari Sultan Cho ( Hon. Sultan of Palace) I am coming to meet you, but I cannot cross the high pass;I am coming to meet you, but the hills and mountains arestanding in my way\u2019I am coming to see you, but I cannot cross the great river.I am coming to meet you, but I am powerless before thechildren and boys; I am totally at a loss in the presence ofworld dam (woman). In this part, she desires to attend the marriage of the king and narrates the obstacles in her way. The obstructions were the high passes, hills and mountains and mostimportantly her step mother. She further expresses in thesecond part: The stars that are shining in the expanse of the sky exist in thehue of the vast sky;I, the dancing girl who comes off the Bekar family, live in thehope of my king Khari Sultan of Kharche and Purig (that hewould shower favours on me). The hill goats (Markhor and Kel) are living because the highmountains provide provision for them. I, the dancing girl ofkharche, depend on my beloved king Khari Sultan of Kharcheand Purig.The \u2018chakors\u2019 and the \u2018ram chakors\u2019, live on the bounties of thegrass land.I, the dancing girl of Kharche, live on the bounties of mybeloved king Khari Sultan Cho of Kharche and Purig.The chakor and ram chakor; all the birds go to take part in themarriage ceremony of great Khari Sultan of Kharche.But I the unfortunate girl; living on the bounties of my king KhariSultan of Kharche. In the song, the orphan girl expresses her vulnerability in front of her step-mother. She says that every creature in the universe is there to enjoy the matrimonial ceremony of her great king but the unfortunate girl is unable to witness themarriage ceremony of her king. She was an ordinary girl but she knew how to convince the contemporary king through her words. Her words were so powerful and dramatic that the king Khari Sultan Cho sent his queen to her parents and asked his workers to arrange the marriage ceremony as if it had not taken place before. The orphan girl was invited by the king. She was dressed and ornamented with the most beautiful and precious clothes and jewels and was seated with the king and the queen.

            "answer_text": "Oh, there are so many! Most of my favourites are not available on YouTube, but let\u2019s see what I can find. One of my favourites is the Danish folk song Jeg s\u00e5 en ulv, en r\u00e6v, en hare. The lyrics in Danish: Jeg s\u00e5 en ulv, en r\u00e6v, en hareJeg s\u00e5 dem danse alle treJeg s\u00e5 en ulv, en r\u00e6v, en hareJeg s\u00e5 dem danse alle tre \u00c5hh, jeg dansed' da ogs\u00e5 med,Dansed' med ulven, r\u00e6ven og haren.\u00c5hh, jeg dansed' da ogs\u00e5 med,Dansed' med dem alle tre. And in English: I saw a wolf, a fox, and a hareI saw all the three of them danceI saw a wolf, a fox, and a hareI saw all the three of them dance O, I danced with them, too,I danced with the wolf, the fox, and the hare.O, I danced with them, too,I danced with all the three of them. The folk orchestra in which my daughter plays the harmonium plays it, here is a version of several children\u2019s folk orchestras playing together (and singing in Swedish):  The next song is one you already know, S\u0101mapri\u1e8fa, but I can\u2019t answer this question without including it. It\u2019s a Karelian folk song with the lyrics also included in the Kalevala, though a little altered. It tells the story of waiting for the son of the house come home with his newly wed wife: The village waited for the new moon.They said my brother would returnempty handed when he was off hunting.They were wrong. The eagle caught the duck. Lyrics in Finnish: Kyl\u00e4 vuotti uutta kuuta (Waiting For The New Moon) Here it\u2019s performed by the Finnish folk music ensemble V\u00e4rttin\u00e4:  I love Swedish folk music perhaps even more than our own. One of my favourite Swedish folk songs is Tusen tankar as performed by Triakel. The lyrics in Swedish: Triakel \u2013 Tusen tankar And in English: I wander within a thousand thoughts,I love the one I cannot haveSo far around the world I meander,Constantly grievingSo much woe is in my heartFor you, my dearest loveSo many fake peopleAre the cause thereto If I never had seen your face,Your eye so blueThen I would never have visitedThe places where you'd beenThen I would have been happyAnd free from care and painThat day will never comeWhen my heart is joyful Look, the beautiful flowers,How sweetly they stand on the groundI grieve till deathFor the one I cannot haveAnd then, if I meet death,Then the sorrow will be yoursNever in this world will youDisappear from my mind (Translation: Tusen tankar lyrics + English translation)  Thanks for asking, S\u0101mapri\u1e8fa!

            "answer_text": "(Stepping in the Melody's ambient)\u2026  Musicians in Aleppo \u2014 Links to songs are in the end of the answer. Appetizers Arabic developed a beauteous word for marking \u201cthe musical orgasm leading to relaxing climaxes of excitement and inciting happiness and earworms\u2019 formation\u201d: tarab, \u0637\u0631\u0628 \u2014 it's commonly associated with long listening hours. Aleppo has got an extra special grain of distinction due to the fact that it was a welcoming carrefour joining variant people of different backgrounds and proveniences. In musicology, Aleppines traditionally came up with a vocab describing \"connoisseur listeners\" (sammi'a \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0651\u0650\u064a\u0639\u064e\u0629). Those were professional music gastronomes whose appetites are satiable only through the finest music. Quoting our famous contemporary singer Sabah Fakhri: I sing for Aleppines three hours, they say: \u201cIt didn't work fine!\u201d, another three hours: \u201cBut we've just arrived!\u201d, another three hours: \u201cWell, we listened to some music but aren't satisfied yet\u2026\u201d  Main Dish: Al-Qudud Al-Halabiya - Aleppine Qudud \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u064f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0629 : The distinction between improvised music and written music became considerable only in the beginning 15th century. But money is a booster capable of changing some standard equations. Arab Caliphs were always passionate about culture and arts, having their palaces filled with musicians and poets and being artists themselves. All activities of this sort were heavily financed by the Caliphate. This generated a sense of a high-standard competition around \u201c who would please the caliph more and get rewarded with more money?\u201d. This creativity-rush pushed art to the next level, increasing complexity and beauty accordingly. A litterateur and life-pleasures-passionate named Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani gathered an encyclopedic anthology of songs, each accompanied by an amusing story. It surpassed 10k pages - summed in about 20 volumes, it held the title of Kitab al-Aghani (book of songs). He later reached Aleppo where he bestowed its governor with his book and got rewarded as a result with 1000 dinar (A golden coin weighing around 4.3g). The Aleppine musical style had a due share of mention.  Most Arabic songs lyrics were poems which, by definition, are organized in a very prosodic way through varied poetic meters. In fact, a viable common theory narrating the birth of Arab poetry is related to the little melodies sung to the herd to better control them: \u062a\u063a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u062e\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645\u201d \u0641\u0631\u062c\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0646\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0646\u0645 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621\u201d. Shepherds sing when tending there camels, as do little boys in their breathers, so they repeated sounds intonating. They called these \u2018sounds' if they were in terms of poems \u201csongs\u201d. (Prolegomena, Ibn Khaldoun)  Generally, the music was characterized by a monophonic structure, string instruments were the protagonists. They may have Maqams as their underlying pattern. Maqams (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a) form the oriental melodic formulas, the first springing spores of constant improvisation, and a refined technique birthing a distinct Arabic music style. They consist of around 27 modes over which music is grown. Obviously, they take the morph of the common scales since they are originally built on them. Thus, they are the linking texture between the patterns and pitches of the developing relationship between notes. It's worth noting that Maqams lack a rhythmic-temporal component leaving that matter subjective and performer-dependent. They can be considered an independent living style per se.  Maqam Al-Saba, typically used when describing sadness and longing  (In fact, Al-Farabi wrote a large music theory book in the tenth century called Great book of music (Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0642\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u200e)). Songs always start with a warm-up, which is either low-nuanced melodies (vocal and instrumental), or a mawwal \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0644 \u2014 the craft of exploiting vowels\u2019 potential (/e/ and /a/ generally); singers chose a couple of short words elongating there vowel syllables for quite a long time. It\u2019s said that Qudud got Influenced by Quran singing recitation called Tajwid, \u062a\u062c\u0648\u064a\u062f, which is the Arabic word for elocution. as well as the prayer caller performed by a muezzin, \u0645\u064f\u0624\u064e\u0630\u0651\u0650\u0646, which are both sons of improvisation.  \u062e\u064f\u0645\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064f\u0628\u0651 (I recommend starting at 3:00)  Make me swill the brew of love So the agita of the heart I forget A life without love, a stream without water Mistress of the glittering scintillant face You are the sobriquet of hope Inebriate me smooching my soul midst the shades of Jasmines. \u062e\u0645\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u0642\u0646\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0639\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0628 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u064a\u0627 \u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0644\u062b\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u064a   (That photo is the famous one for Sabah Fakhri, where he opens his hands as if flying after too much singing :))  This playlist has the collection of the most renowned songs \u200e\u202b\u200e\u202b. \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0635\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0641\u062e\u0631\u064a -   Addendum: it's worth noting that Sicilians had skilled street story-teller-singers, I cantastorie Siciliani, who developed nice Italian Greek-Arab influenced music:   ",

I learned some Polish folk songs, when I was previously a member of a Polish folkloric ensemble called, \u2018Tatry\u2019 in Australia. We would sing the songs and perform folk dances. I still sing the songs at home and sometimes, I even sing them aloud on top of a hill during my hiking trips. Traditional Polish folk songs, which stand out for me are the following: \u2018Czerwony Pas\u2019 (Red Belt):  \u2018Lipka Zielona\u2019 ( A Little Green Linden): \u201cA song sung in the Polish spirit. I\u2019m still trying to find out why there is an Orthodox Priest in this film clip, as many Polish people are generally, Catholic. They must be near the border, where mixed ethnic communities in villages mingle, perhaps.\u201d  \u2018To i Hola\u2019:  \u2018Czerwony Jagodi\u2019 (Red Berry):  \u2018Czerwone Jab\u0142uszko\u2019 (Red Apple): A beautiful song.  A Polish patriotic song: \u2018Dzi\u015b do ciebie przyj\u015b\u0107 nie mog\u0119\u2019 (Today, I cannot come to you)  And, \u2018Laleczka z Saskiej Porcelany\u2019 (Doll from Saska Porcelain) is a popular modern song, which is suitable to sing to children:  ",

Finnish folk songs and folk music in general have an ability to compress sorrow and melancholy in simple songs that are still empowering. At least that\u2019s how they affect me.I know that some dislike them, because they feel rather anxiety than empowerment, but to me these are songs that, even though they might make me cry, also give relief and some kind of purified feeling. The first one is an old lullaby, Nuku, nuku nurmilintu / Sleep, sleep grassland bird. On one hand, it\u2019s a simple and beautiful, yet melancholic lullaby. On the other hand it\u2019s even shocking: In the old times really many children died in their early age and this song can be interpreted through the idea of a mother singing to her deceased child, I don\u2019t know where I got this interpretation from, but to me it is obvious. This makes me often cry:  Alahall\u2019 on allin mieli / Low are the calloo's spirits is an ancient song that describes the bottomless sorrow by tyhe singer identifying with birds in freezing weather:  Ell\u00f6s huolta huomisesta / Don\u2019t you worry about tomorrow is a song\u2026 I don\u2019t really know, It\u2019s just a song about hope, I think. I\u2019ll link a translation under the video:  Ell\u00f6s huolta huomisesta We have different kind of folk music too, that is not based on melancholy. This is Lasetus. I cant translate that\u2026  Tellun polska / Tellus\u2019s polka: is just a polka. A girl is thinking of men and romance. An old pop song, I think, with light words and romantic expectations:  There are songs that are actually old pagan spells or magic words: T\u00e4ss\u2019 on nainen / Here\u2019s a woman is about going to trance. There\u2019s an error in both Finnish and English lyrics: the text talks about sin (synti). That\u2019s wrong. It should be birth (synty) That refers to the magical and mythical origin of things:  Raudan synty / Birth of iron is based on the magical words that were needed to make iron in the Iron Age. We don\u2019t need them anymore to make iron, so they\u2019ve become matertial for artistic interpretation:  This morning\u2019s best folk songs\u2026 ",

Kashmiri - Che loguth sorma cheshman (When you applied that kohl to your eyes) - You get it right? Beauty, love..etc.  Harmukh bar tal (At the foot of Harmukh) Harmukh is a mountain in kashmir. The song believed to be a bhajan by kashmiri Pandits, something sang by the Goddess Parvati to Shiva, and a love song by the Muslims.  Chol Hama roshay roshay (Cholhama means abandoned, and roshay means a feeling of rage ) Thus, the song ia about the lover leaving the woman behind after getting upset over something and she pleading him to come back.  Other than this, I'm a HUGE admirer of Papon\u2019s music, and really like his renditions of Assamese folk songs - Jhumoor, the tea garden song -  Bihu naam, A medley of romantic bihu songs  Boitha maro re  I mostly listen to folk-fusion and Asian underground by independent artists and coke studio. But including all of them will blow up the length of my answer, so I'll stop here. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "Pakistan is home to many different cultures with dozens of languages. Thanks to this diversity, we have a rich variety of great folk music. Quite a bit of it is centuries old and comes with its own history. Urdu is a language spoken by millions of people in India and Pakistan. It evolved from a fusion of different languages and cultures in the melting pot of the South Asian subcontinent. To find Urdu folk music, we have to go way back into the past\u2026 to 13th century. There was once a man known as Ameer Khusrow. He was a genius with many talents and extraordinary capabilities. He was a poet, scholar, musician and mystic. He had been associated with the courts of seven sultans of Delhi. His stature as a poet was such that even a change of three dynasties did not affect his popularity. He was also fondly known as \u201cTooti-e-Hind\u201d or Songbird of India. He can be considered one of the fathers of Indian classical music for his contribution. He is credited with the \u201cKhayal\u201d style of singing. The \u201cTarana\u201d form of a classical melody is his innovation. He is also known as the founder of \u201cQawwali\u201d, a devotional type of music. According to some people, it was his idea to split a Pakhawaj/Mridingam into two parts and invent the Tabla. The vast body of his poetic work includes epic poems, eulogies, love songs and even riddles. But what he is known most for is his poetry of mysticism and divine love. Not only he wrote the poetry but he also composed it himself. These compositions are being sung to this day. Countless singers have lent their voices to his melodies.  Punjabi is another language with a rich history and culture and a great number of speakers. Unlike Urdu\u2019s cosmopolitan origins, Punjabi is indigenous. It came into being roughly around the same time as Urdu. In Urdu literature, works of prose as well as poetry started simultaneously. But in the history of Punjabi literature, poetry seems to have outweighed prose by far. Most of this poetry is mystical in nature. One of the most well-known poetic works in Punjabi is the Story of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah. It is a love story of two unfortunate souls, Heer and Ranjha, who fell in love, lost each other and met tragic ends. Although it is a tale of worldly matters, it has spiritual undertones. Ever since it was written in the mid-eighteenth century, it has been memorized and sung by countless people. I have chosen this particular clip because this is how it was traditionally sung in villages:  Jagga Daaku, or Jagga the Robber was a rebel and outlaw in the early 20th century Punjab, who earned himself a reputation similar to Robin Hood\u2019s. He famously robbed moneylenders because they made their money by usury while squeezing every penny out of their poor debtors. He was known to share the loot with the poor. He also attacked the police because they were instruments of our colonial masters, the British. He was deceitfully murdered at the age of 29, at the behest of the local government agent according to the legend. He has been celebrated and mourned by countless singers.  Nearly a thousand years ago, a mystic by the name of Usman Marwandi found his way to the town of Sehwan in Sindh, where he settled. He found vast acclaim and a great number of followers because of his personality, his poetry and his teachings and came to be known as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The universally famous song \u201cDama dam mast Qalandar\u201d celebrates him, and was reportedly originally composed in the 13th century. The original was most likely in Sindhi, but it has also been sung in Urdu and Punjabi. Thousands of different singers have performed this song all over the world. The version I am sharing here has a longish build-up. The classical melody starts at 3:20.  \u201cTappay\u201d is a form of song in Punjabi. As it is a form, it has no fixed lyrics. However, the lyrics do have a fixed four-line structure in a short meter and a particular melody. The content often deals with love, longing, devotion and loss. Sometimes, two singers sing Tappay in competition. They try to outdo each other with the sensitivity of their lyrics. Oftentimes, they compose their lyrics extemporaneously, either attempting to convey a sentiment with a novel simile or metaphor, or mocking the other singer.  ",

Mainly because, Afghanistan's political and social elite looked down upon it and instead, quite ironically they patronized Indian-style music with all the Raags and Taals of Tabla and Harmonium totally alien to our musical DNA. The net result is that while we have had some rather impressive classical singers like Sarahang and Nashenas etc, our folk music was lent to the fringes of the society, the local weddings and even unfortunately as a tool for the disgusting bachabazi culture. Nonetheless, recently and after 2001, some Afghan singers have made goo Continue Reading",
