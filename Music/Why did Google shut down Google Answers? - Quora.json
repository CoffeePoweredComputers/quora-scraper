            "answer_text": "I used Google Answers many times during the early 2000s. Keep in mind, this was a paid Q&A site, unlike Quora. You asked a question, stated how much you wanted to pay to get the answer, and a Google Researcher (GR) would \"research\" the answer for you, providing links to relevant sources. A brief explanation would be provided to summarize linked material, and if you also got \"personal commentary\" based on their own expertise, that was simply icing on the cake, and not a requirement. I think it had a certain appeal to two groups people with more money than timepeople who did not know how searchIf memory serves (it's been a while), researchers were put into groups based on their personal background of interest in a particular subject or subjects. The \"asker\" then asked the question and it was accepted by whichever researcher (for whichever category your question fell into) was willing to do the work for the amount offered. There were probably quite a few idiots out there who bid ridiculously low amounts on complex questions, which quite possible, had no answer. Here I am in 2002 trying to pay $10 to unlock the \"secrets\" of search engine optimization (SEO) and how the Google ranking algo works. http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/58650.html It was an honest question, given my near zero SEO knowledge at the time. It wasn't until quite a few years later, that I finally realized my question was impossible to answer (i.e. Nobody knows how Google ranks their results, except Google. Everybody else is just guessing) and especially not for ten bucks. I had no idea, at the time, the only good answer could come from an experienced SEO that charges $200 an hour to explain it to me. Now, keep in mind, the amounts bid on were split; 80% for the researcher and 20% for Google (if memory serves). On that particular question, they made only $2. From that, they had to pay credit card processing fees ($.50 maybe?). Not a whole lot of money. Most typically, you'd see bids from $2 to $10. Every once in a while I'd see a $200 bid (the maximum you could bid), but that was rare. I strongly suspect that they shut down simply due to lack of volume. Unlike their current advertising model, there was simply no way to mechanize the Google Answers business model. In short, it did not scale well. There was probably a lot of back-end adminstration happening, with respect to refunds. One of the rules with the bidding system was that if the asker was not completely satisfied with the answer the researcher provided, they could receive a full refund of the bid, less a $.50 transaction cost. This \"honor system\" likely set themselves up for many people who would come to abuse the system, asking a complex question (perhaps lured by a good offer), then simply saying they weren't satisfied with the answer they received. It's subjective. Whose to say whether they were or weren't satisfied? No evidence to back it up, but I strongly suspect people could not make a decent living as a GR. I watched some of the more popular ones in action over a period of time (after a while, you get to know the names of the prominent answerers -- just like here at Quora). I did mental calculations (based on bids and number of answers provided) and concluded, at the time, that it wasn't very profitable to be a GR. Maybe no money on both ends. That's my best guess. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Answers for a lot of reasons. One of them is nicely circular.... The people who knew about Google answers were mostly capable of doing a pretty good search on their own. Maybe not a librarian quality search that might use Lexis-Nexis, Pub Med or Chem Abstracts, but an okay search of Google, which was right there. The people who could use help in search did not know about Google Answers, and I don't think Google Answers advertised like KGB has. So, Google answers was trying to stand between to chairs - effectively competing with themselves. Maybe it was an experiment to see if there was a good market for help with search. Personal experience... I had some questions where I wanted to get answers that were NOT on the internet, preferably by experts of people familiar with a field. An example: What's the price that people are paying for a new Cadillac Deville? Not the MSRP, which is all over. And not a guess at \"dealer cost\" (before holdbacks) [dealer cost is now on the web, back then it was rare]. But someone who works in Cadillac  car dealership - in accounting or sales would know. I very clearly specified this in the question. What I got for answers was a bunch of people who wanted to make money doing easy internet research, providing the MSRP answer. Pretty useless. I got this useless type of crap on every type of question - I don't think there was a single domain expert - all a bunch of people wanting to get paid for stock answers. Was I willing to pay $20-50 for a good answer? Yes. Big waste of time. ",
