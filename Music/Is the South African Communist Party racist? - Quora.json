            "answer_text": "No, they were pretty consistent in their support for a multiracial \u201cSocialist\u201d South Africa, but like any organisation dominated by white people the early SACP wasn\u2019t always sensitive to race (organisations dominated by men often have this problem vis a vis gender). The best example of this was prior to Apartheid, when the early SACP participated in a miners\u2019 strike known as the Rand Revolt which had a white supremacist dimension (as white miners feared competition from less paid black miners). In the novel A Sparrow Falls, Wilbur Smith portrays the SACP actively engaging in white supremacist rhetoric for cynical tactical reasons; however, academic sources[1] suggest it might have been more complicated than that (it\u2019s more that they kept their mouths shut about racism and supported the strike in the naive hope it would eventually follow a non-racist Marxist course). The failure of the Rand Revolt and racist violence that followed made the SACP give up on the Afrikaner working class to an extent. For almost it\u2019s entire history, the SACP supported a multiracial Marxist-Leninist South Africa, hoping to unify black and white South Africans on the basis of class. In 1928 the Communist International (Comintern) forced the SACP to adopt the Native Republic thesis that South Africa belonged to the black African majority.[2]They also criticised the Communist Party\u2019s race blind approach as making it easier for the ruling class to divide white and black workers (they didn\u2019t want the SACP to abandon oppressed white workers, but instead abandon white worker chauvinism). No matter what their intentions, organisations (even progressive ones) are often influenced by the prejudices of the society they emerge within (for example anti-Semitism had a place within Russian Bolshevism, despite the fact that many early leading members were Jewish and officially the Party opposed it; there are plenty historical examples of hypocrisy amongst western leftist groups too, in addition the good they did). During the Apartheid regime, however, the SACP played what was undeniably a lead role in the struggle against white supremacy by organising the armed resistance group, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation or MK) alongside the African National Congress. Today the SACP governs alongside the social democratic ANC in a Tripartite Alliance (which is dominated by the ANC). South Africa\u2019s two best known communists:  Joe Slovo, above, Jewish-White South African and General-Secretary of the Party 1984\u20131991, military commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe and Minister of Housing in Nelson Mandela\u2019s first government Chris Hani, below, Joe Slovo\u2019s successor as General-Secretary of the Party, assassinated in 1993 by a Far Right Polish immigrant.

            "answer_text": "Mark here: No, it is not racist, it is opportunist. The South African Communist Party, the SACP, first came into prominence mobilising the Poor White Afrikaners & Cornish miners against the intrusion of Blacks into the economy. They raised the slogan, \u201cForward the Bolshevik Revolution & keep South Africa White!\u201d they organised a strike against the mines for employing Blacks & sent their apparatchiks to murder lone Black \u2019Scabs\u2019 (labourers). General Smuts\u2019s Administration smacked them into the ground, & the ringleaders, trapped in a building in Fordsburg, committed suicide rather than face trial. However, there wasn\u2019t a witch-hunt of Communists to follow, & those (many) who had not actually been seen killing or leading killers, were not pursued or prosecuted. They kept a low profile for a while. & reassessing, they decided rather to agitate for the Black Labourers, & so the history, ultimately, of the New South Africa. But those noble champions of \u2018The Struggle\u2019 had Black Blood on their hands, innocent Black blood, & they still do, whether as the victims of their Bolshevik Revolution, or as their hapless tools in pursuit of the same. The Black South Africans are not their fellows, nor their innocent, helpless charges, but the vehicle of their power, & as soon as the party they supported becomes the Victor, they raise another from the \u2018oppressed masses\u2019 to support & whip to revolt, & so on, again & again. This is the actual methodology of Communism; its on record, their record. & in case you think this is a local aberration of the breed, Some-time Premier of the USSR, Breshnev, first came to prominence in the Party with a laudatory academic paper on South Africa\u2019s SACP. They\u2019re all the same. ",
