            "answer_text": "The most probable way to explain this is : you did hear it already. When evening comes, look at your day. Did you listen to radio ? How many songs you remember ? Did you pass by a club, or sit in coffee house ? They usually have some music going\u2026 how much you can remember of it ? Very little, probably. The thing is, our brains are now used to a bunch of things around us. A lot of things happen, and we generally can focus only on one. Well, while your brain focused on conversation, drawing, writing, playing a game or whatever, your subconscious briefly switched and heard a song. You don\u2019t know you heard it. But you did. Me, for example, have this thing (almost all of us do), when you hear song in the morning, and sing it whole damn day. Sometimes, I don\u2019t even know where I heard it until I manage to recall somehow or something reminds me of where I heard it that morning. Sometimes I play radio in the morning, and while I don\u2019t exactly pay attention to everything on there, my stupid brain manages to remember one song that I don\u2019t recall, than replay it all day long. Of course, you may be a hidden Bach, or Beetoven. Or Mozzart. But it\u2019s far more likely that you had what I described. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if I assume it has about the same reasons that are in play with me when I dream music, then there are more or less two posibilitys. 1.: you actually have heard the music before but didn't consciously notice so and your brain just randomly added it to the dream. Or 2.: your brain does what it does so often in dreams: combine everything. You might just have \"on-the-fly-composed\" a new piece of music simply by combining random parts of all the music that is somewhere in your head... Maybe even some music that is strangely impossible in real life. Both happens pretty often--so much so that making music is one of the most common things I actively do when dreaming lucid (or being awake... Or dream regularly...)... That and fly around in everchanging monolithic architechtural... \"Spaces\" as well solving some math problem, the first for fun the second to wake up. ",
