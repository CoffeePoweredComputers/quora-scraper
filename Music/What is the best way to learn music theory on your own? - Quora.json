            "answer_text": "I learned all I know about music theory on my own.  And this was pre-internet.  So I'll answer from my own experience.  I began as a child plunking around on an old out-of-tune upright piano left to us by my Great-Grandmother when she died.  I had no idea it was out of tune so the first piece I learned in full (Pachelbel's Canon in D) was learned in G.  I had no idea what \"in D\" meant at age 8 so I just went with it.  It was when I played it at a friend's house on her piano that was in tune that I discovered how different and odd it sounded.  I was laughed at and mocked for playing a song named \"..... in D\" in the key of G.  So I went home and relearned it in the correct key.   Jim Davis's answer to What was the first moment in your life when you realized you fell in love with music (to create, listen, or perform)? This prompted me to want to discover any and everything about music and it's communicative abilities through media other than sound.  I began figuring out pieces from songs or music I'd listen to and once I had them learned, I'd go buy or \"borrow\" sheet music and see what those sounds looked like on the page.  This led me to want to discover even more. So I began reading books on Music Theory.  Anything I could find.  Then I began attempting to find examples of what was being taught to me in common music or songs of the day.  I'd look for contrary motion in Def Leppard songs.  I'd try to examine the counterpoint in Cyndi Lauper's current hits.  I'd attempt to add new harmonies to Alabama tunes.   This gave me a starting point to work from so that as I read more and more theory, I could apply it mentally.  I used the songs that inundated me on a daily basis as inspiration to learn and discover.  My dad liked Bruce Springsteen and Handel.  So I learned to love the complexities of Rock and Classical.  My mom loved Bonnie Tyler and Rod Stewart.  So I learned to love the subtle nuances present in modern Pop.  I began to find similarities between the work of Irene Cara and John Williams.  Poison and Chicago.  Dream Theater and Miles Davis.   I'm sure I learned tons of stuff in reverse and no curriculum in the world would likely align with how I did it, but it worked for me.  And that's the key.  Find what works for you.  I found that having some practical knowledge made the theory part easier to grasp.  Much like architecture; once you've hammered nails, poured concrete and laid bricks, the theories and abstract analyses of building present themselves much more clearly.  The same is true with music.

            "answer_text": "If for any reason you cannot attend a school to learn about music and theory then you will most likely want to invest in a great teacher who knows music theory extremely well and how to get to the basics and explain them in a way anyone could understand. You will want to start reading about music theory and writing tons of notes into a special notebook you will want to start keeping. This will help you measure how much you learn as well as making the learning personalize to you. You MUST make it personalized to you in order to truly learn music theory. This means as soon as you learn about a technique you start composing using that technique to ingrain it within you as quickly as possible. You want to start at the very beginning of music theory to make sure you don\u2019t have any gaps or holes in your understanding. Learning music theory is a journey that can be an amazing brain opener, tons of fun, and very useful. But it can be difficult when you're just starting out to know what exactly to start with. Let me give you an overview on what you want to start out learning as quickly and deeply as possible. Learning basic music theory is absolutely necessary to communicate with other musicians. Whether we are writing a song together, playing a show on stage, or just jamming at the house, we have to know how to talk about what it is we're playing. Luckily, this stuff is really easy to learn! Here are some of the essentials of music theory that you will need to know to get started. AlphabetThe music alphabet is like the English alphabet. It is a system of letters that are assigned to represent sounds in music that we call notes. This is the simplest part to learn, and everything else will be based on this, so start here! A, B, C, D, E, F, G The 7 basic notes A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab. The 12 notes with sharp/flat enharmonic spellings Scales Scales are just a linear arrangement of notes. If notes are actual pitches, then scales are those pitches in a certain order. (ex. A B C D E F G) Because scales or pieces of scales are used in just about every song ever written, they are a huge piece of basic music theory. You will want to learn the scales and their numeric formulae which correspond to the musical intervals. (As an example of numeric formulae The Major scale a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The natural minor scale is 1, 2, b3. 4, 5, b6, b7.) A short list of scales to learn and memorize: Major and minor Pentatonic, melodic major scale, harmonic major scale, natural minor scale, melodic minor scale, harmonic minor scale, Hungarian minor scale, diminished scale, whole tone scale, enigmatic scale. Each scale has as many modes as it has notes. The modes of the major scale are Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian. The modes of the other scales will vary in both shape and intervallic formulae. Intervals In music theory, an interval is the difference between two pitches. An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord. An interval list: Perfect unison, minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, augmented fourth/diminished fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, perfect octave, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth. ChordsChords are certain members of a scale combined into one sound. (For instance \"C + E + G = CMaj\" or \"D + F + A = DMin\".) Chords give structure, organization, and shape to a song. They make the song \"sound\" a certain way. Even if you are strictly a lead player, you NEED to know this. Even as a violinist, I use chords all the time to talk about the songs. I'll play that fill after the G7 chord. A chord list: diad, major triad, minor triad, diminished triad, augmented triad, major 7th, minor 7th, diminished 7th, augmented 7th, major 9th, minor 9th, augmented 9th, diminished 9th, major 11th, minor 11th, augmented 11th, diminished 11th, major 13th, minor 13th, augmented 13th, diminished 13th. There are also alterations of these chords; major 13(#11,b9), 7(#5,b9), etc\u2026. Key SignaturesKey signatures tell us the tonality or \"key\" of a song. It also tells us which notes the song will be using. The more you work with these, the more familiar you get with the range and scale of particular keys. Unless you want all of your songs to sound the same, PLEASE study these.  As you are learning these things you will want to train your ears to hear all this information so that when you listen to apiece of music you want to play or transcribe you can listen for notes, intervals, chords and scales you know! You will want to sing with everything! This will get you started! After you really start to memorize and know these topics you will want to carry on learning more advanced theory like modulation, composition techniques like secondary dominants, secondary leading tones, parallel keys, counterpoint, diatonic concepts, chromatic concepts, borrowed chords, pitch axis theory, etc,\u2026\u2026. Ask me if you still need help. ",
