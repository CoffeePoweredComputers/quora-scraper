            "answer_text": "You have one of these, right?  I have never played one but it looks like a fine bass and I don't see any reason that slapping shouldn't work on it.  In my experience slapping sometimes doesn't work on a bass because the action is too low, or maybe there's not enough room between the strings and pickups for the string to move enough to get a tone. OK let's be clear on one point.  Slapping doesn't depend upon the pickups or the electronics.  It's between you and the strings and that's all there is to it.  It is a type of fingerstyle technique, if you like, and whether you do it amplified or unamplified it should basically sound the same. Have you checked your technique?  The thumb sometimes gives trouble if you don't \"bounce\" it off of the string, as if you slap it and leave the thumb on the string you will mute the tone.  The snapping should be fine and make a bright sharp sound, on any bass, regardless of whether it is active or passive or whatever.  I doubt if Larry Graham had any active electronics on his Jazz... Probably if you watch a couple of videos on line and do a bit of woodshedding you'll get it pretty quick.  Larry Graham himself has some, (he's a pretty light touch when you compare him with Flea, who also has an instructional video and beats the hell out of his bass) and I'm sure you can find one that suits your style.

            "answer_text": "It has to be either a setup issue or a technique issue, since I was slapping on one of those basses just the other day at guitar center, and it sounded fine. I know next to nothing about proper set up for slapping, so I'll just go through technique. I know you said you think your technique is pretty good, but I'll run through some basic instructions anyway, and also add a couple pointers that could help. You're gonna take your thumb and hit the string in your bass. An important distinction to make is that you aren't just hitting it against the string in a \u201clower your thumb quickly and hit it\u201d. It's more like a flick of the wrist. You turn your wrist quickly and hit your thumb against the string. If you don't understand what I'm saying, watch ScottBassLessons\u2019 video on the basics of slapping.  Generally the best place to hit it is right at the end of the fretboard, but not on the fretboard. You also need to make sure you're just bouncing the thumb off of the string, not muting the string with the thumb. You didn't say that you were having trouble with popping, but here's a quick run through on that too. You're just gonna take a string, sort of grab it, and then pull it up where once you release it, it'll snap against the fretboard. It can be difficult at first (it was for me), but after a while it becomes extremely easy, to where you can just do it with no though whatsoever. Anyway, I hope this helped. If I think of any more tips, I'll edit this answer to give them to you. Best of luck with your slapping. :) ",
