They were released around the same time, but Everglow has nearly 70 million more views. Everglow obviously wins from views. But THIS is ridiculous(not in a bad way, just an astonishing way) EVERGLOW: LA DI DA, 56 million views, 2 WEEKS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeI992mvlEY IZ*ONE: Secret Story of the swan 47 million views, 3 MONTHS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnVjsos40qk 3 month difference, 10 million views difference. Wow. I\u2019m both a Forever and a Wiz*one, so this is amazing. From personal experience: I heard of Everglow before Iz*one, because the YouTube algorithm recommended it to me more. I\u2019ve seen many people talk about them, so I was more familiar about them. In conclusion: Everglow is more popular than Iz*one ",
