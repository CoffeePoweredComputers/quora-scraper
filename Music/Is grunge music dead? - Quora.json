            "answer_text": "There are few grunge bands currently in existence and still playing, but the genre is still currently widely appreciated. It was one of the most influencal times of recent music and it still receives lots of credit, at least where I am. Some bands that still try to carry it on would be: Socotra, Clutch, and maybe the Foo Fighters, but it has more morphed into what we call alternative rock, which is a very lit music classification these days, in my opinion.
