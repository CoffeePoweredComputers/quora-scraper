Presley and Schilling met on Sunday, July 11, 1954. Schilling was only 12 years old and was invited by Red West to join him, Presley, and others in a football game. Presley was the quarterback and threw a pass at Schilling. Since it was such a good catch, Schilling was invited back to play games every Sunday for a couple of years until Presley was too busy traveling to be able to play. A couple of years later, Schilling paid a visit to Presley and rekindled their friendship. Not long after, Presley asked Schilling to join his entourage, which came to be known as the \"Memphis Mafia\", and he agreed. A couple of hours later, they were ready to hit the road. ",
