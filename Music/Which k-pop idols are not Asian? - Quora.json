            "answer_text": "No, at the moment I don\u2019t think there are any active idols who are completely non Asian. There are a few who are half asian like Seventeen\u2019s Vernon, Samuel (solo artist), Momoland\u2019s Nancy. The only Non Asian that I know of who debuted in an Idol group was BP Rania\u2019s Alex who is American. But her company basically used her as a prop to get attention for the group. She had a small music career in the US, the company basically contacted her and put her in the group without actually training her. The company treated her pretty poorly, they wouldn\u2019t let her promote with the group most of the time, left her out of the first music video with them, and the few times they did include her in performances they just had her walk up, Rap, then walk off. I think there was only one comeback where they actually included her in the choreography. In the end, when the company realized they weren\u2019t getting any more attention with her, they kicked her out of the group. I think there was another group called Oh My Jewel who had a Russian girl in the line up but I don\u2019t think that group actually debuted. And if there were any other groups with nonasian members, they weren\u2019t successful.   So yeah, while Kpop has expanded to include foreign members, they haven\u2019t expanded past East Asians. Keep in mind, Korea in general is still a very conservative and close off country who doesn\u2019t take well to foreigner taking jobs from their citizens. The entertainment industry of course is a lot more open and there have been a handful of Non Asian variety stars who\u2019ve made a career of appearing on korean shows but when it comes to Kpop Idol groups, I think we probably have another generation before we start seeing non Asian idols if at all. At the end of the day, they\u2019re creating a Korean Pop group, emphasis on the \u201cKorean\u201d so you gotta look the part just as much as being able to perform it. ",
