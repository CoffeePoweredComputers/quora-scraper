            "answer_text": "Interesting question. So how does one of the most successful composer, if not the most successful composer on the entire planet earth write songs? Wow! I cannot answer that. Nobody can credibly and rightfully answer that except for that one person who is most qualified: the man himself -  Paul McCartney: You sort of put yourself in the mode of remembering who you are. Remember, you are the kid who used to get on that bus, and go down to Lewis's, and buy your little things in your brown paper pocket\u2026and look at it, read it all the way home: the record. And you used to get that thrilled and involved with the record because you knew you loved these people, whoever they were, whoever the band was. So when I write\u2026I tend to do that. I'm not looking for what the public will want, I'm looking for the public in me. It's just me sitting down there and saying, \u201cI've got my heart on a string and everything's a flutter\" cos that seems to fit, and it seems to be that kind of nervousness of love, a little fluter. I just try get stuff that seems good and seems to fit and that feels right. But if you're lucky, these things write themselves. But where does a song come from? I've been asked that a thousand times, and every composer you ever hear says - \u201cWell, I sit down and it sort of comes through. I'm a vehicle.\u201d And it's true, you are. You sit down and have a bit of fun\u2026you love playing on the old piano or the guitar. Suddenly, this little idea comes through! When I get in my car and turn on the radio, I want to hear some good sounds. So whatever I write I write for that. I'd say I've done songs that are really good; some I think didn't quite come off; some I hate. But I've never done enough to satisfy myself that I'm okay. That's basically what I'm looking for, like most people. (\u201cMcCartney - Songwriter\u201d by Howard Elson) ",

            "answer_text": "McCartney may have preferred techniques, but it comes down to using any one of them to create a sensation of satisfaction. People who love music are so emotionally moved by sound and rhythm that noodling around on an instrument, be it a guitar, piano or humming is applied as a catalyst to create a \u201chook\u201d that provides enough pleasure to make it worth spending hours, if necessary, to finish a given piece. In other words, if the melody makes the artist feel good, that becomes the Skinner box lever that provides the food pellets required for the artist to indulge this desire to enjoy oneself until something has been structured that delights the songwriter. As for the quality of a given piece, that becomes more subjective than successfully qualitative. For example, McCartney\u2019s \u201cGive Me a Ring\u201d hits me as being delicious as a cherry Danish. This song is a perfect pop song model in that, just like John Lennon\u2019s better known \u201cTicket to Ride,\u201d runs through three completely original musical blocks, all of which interchange until the song\u2019s conclusion. His lyrics are playful and simple and well done. The song is principally about a boy who hopes that a girl will ultimately call him on the phone, thereby igniting a romance. And in typical McCartney fashion, a story is told in a balanced pace, whose verses describe the \u201cI want\u201d of the narrator progressively. The bridge does not move the story forward as much as offer additional information about how the narrator feels and why in relation to his objective. The chorus is expressed quickly, has a punch, modulates the melody upward in pitch and speedily returns to the normal key of the song. None of this can explain with any reliable specificity how to create lightning in a bottle or the actual, physical nature of this apparently magical electricity that becomes a catchy song. Its essence of fun and emotionally moving nature is generated from a nature-vs.-nurture tug of war whose outcome is a matter of luck, talent, developed skill, ambition, joy in pursuing craft and all the intellectual and emotional experiences unique to a given songwriter. Also, there is the matter of potential: just because someone can do something doesn\u2019t guarantee he or she has a knack for it. Some people are fated to create hot dogs, whereas others might achieve prime rib. The aforementioned description is not elusive double-talk. It\u2019s just that if it were possible to create a method or means of manufacturing an endless series of distinctive, original hit-level pop songs, someone would become a millionaire for compiling this and every reader a millionaire for applying such a book. But I can say with assurance that all master songwriters produce their work from employing a natural sensitivity to craft. What enables some to become \u201clifers,\u201d whereas others lose the touch early on, is a purity of love for the art and craft of songwriting, regardless of the end result. They move ahead with confidence and desire for adventure and the hope that on each fishing expedition they will hook another Moby Dick. All can enjoy their output, but it is other experts in this genre of writing who can recognize what has gone into a song in all subtle, as well as pronounced, ways. But, again, a clarified grasp of what an artistic technician has produced offers nothing concrete in terms of being able to complete the same feat oneself: what is easy to understand is not necessarily easy to create in one\u2019s own right. A great song is like an archeological treasure: it can only be understood by deconstruction, by working backwards from a finished product to its genesis point. McCartney has disappointed audiences by appearing to oversimplifying the issue, in saying he doesn\u2019t know where it comes from. But this is very common with even the greatest writers (and McCartney is amongst the greatest that ever lived). Watching Robin Williams\u2019 The Dead Poets Society indicates that great written art must be felt and cannot be manufactured on an assembly line, nor can its essence be effectually captured and symmetrically quantified with graphs and other means of assessment. This leads one down the garden path to various possible causal wellsprings, such as spirituality, faith, luck or superstition. Is one a conduit for a supernatural communication or inspiration? Many defer to sharing credit with a muse, a spirit: someone or something that helps lead one to a desired outcome, or aid in encouraging awareness that allows for one to solve the riddles that stand between one and the successful pursuit of excellence. Ultimately, defining how a creative task is achieved can become as cryptic as trying to describe the essence of the brain or one\u2019s soul. As for myself, I am spurred by a melody that randomly comes to me, and whose mood indicates what the piece should be about. Then rhythm and tempo drive the melody in the directions required to make it infectious and fun. What enables me to still pursue songwriting as vigorously as when I was in my 20s is that I can still look at my subject matter with the same childlike curiosity that led me down this creative path a million times before. But I never tire of performing the same task for its repetition, because the outcome is what supplies the unpredictability whose fun encourages me to go back for more. (Does anyone really get fed up with pizza or chocolate cake?) But in the end, regardless of methodology, only the drive and curiosity will enable any manner of technique to create anything meaningful. The end result of a creative pursuit is a strict reflection of how bright a fire burns in the belly of the writer. If the fire fades, then the outcome will tell the listener that the thrill is waning. The energy must be same every time out, because, as we all know, a writer is only as good as his last assignment. Each song requires the writer, regardless of how seasoned, to start from scratch. So, how does McCartney actually write a song? There\u2019s no formula, I\u2019m afraid. There\u2019s one\u2019s biorhythm on a given day. There\u2019s one\u2019s ambition to achieve greatness or master something an outsider to one\u2019s brain can\u2019t see. There\u2019s the sheer love of the sport. And there\u2019s the refinement that experience brings to the experience. But in the end, it is the raw desire to achieve and outcome based on how bad one, in his heart of hearts genuinely wants it. Just as I have struggled, using my lifetime\u2019s-worth of acquired writing skills to attempt a realistic, clarified authentic explanation, despite how nebulous this subject matter truly is, I have forded a jungle of difficulty because of the joy and satisfaction that comes with success in conveying from my brain to yours what I feel to be the truth of this question. And that\u2019s what stands behind and supports any writer, from beginning to end of any creative enterprise. Did I succeed? Hard to know. But for a true writer, the journey is its own reward, regardless of outcome. The brain is an amazing, yet often confusingly complex organ. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure I understand the specific, step-by-step dynamics that causes something like a song to appear from the mist, out of nowhere\u2014and yet exist for eternity once written. And I don\u2019t hold against McCartney when he says he doesn\u2019t understand how he does it, because I don\u2019t think he really understands how his brain works any more than anyone else does. But one thing\u2019s for sure: he has the knack, and with it serves up many plates of prime rib, whereas most other practitioners of song craft are doomed to be hot dog vendors. ",
