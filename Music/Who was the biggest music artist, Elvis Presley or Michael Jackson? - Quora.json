            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Ronnie I would say Elvis. Michael Jackson was big too, obviously, but Elvis's fan base goes right across the board. He has fans of all ages, all races, and he has those who loved him in life, and those that love him in posthumously. There will continue to be Elvis fans, generation after generation. Elvis\u2019s persona, and his role in the evolution of modern music makes him a Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll icon, with absolutely no one to rival him. Michael Jackson is fantastically talented. He is superior when it comes to writing musical scores, and dancing probably, but in terms of the bigger star who has the whole package, the looks, the sexuality, the voice, the charisma, the mystique, the history, the story, the fashion, it has to be Elvis every time. If he was still here I'd say long live the King, but as far as we know we have to let him rest in peace. Mr Presley  Mr Jackson  ",
