I previously had Lowe Stein as well as Winsberg and Arnold as my attorneys and it wasn't until I hired Cindy that things started to change, and considerably. See came highly recommended by 2 judges I know and put it this way, after our first court date my ex fired her attorney because we kicked their ass so bad. If you are going through a messy divorce trust me there is no one better. She doesn't advertise online so you won't find much on her, ask people in the family law field and they will all know who she is, her reputation is amazing. You will thank me later. ",
