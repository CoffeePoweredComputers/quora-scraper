            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very, very rare for a DJ to just decide they like a song and start spinning it nowadays. Usually, there is a serious campaign from the record label (or distribution company\u2019s) sales, marketing, and radio promotion departments. The campaign requires a ton of phone calls and usually working relationships with the independent radio promoters. And, believe it or not, it really does matter to a station (or more specifically, the chain of stations owned by the main entity) that this campaign is being carried out. Why? Because the radio station isn\u2019t making money off playing music. They are making money off of attention. Because of that, they are terrified of losing listener\u2019s attention for even a moment (trust me, I\u2019ve heard the group calls with Program Directors from across the country). This is why you usually only hear songs from well known artists or ones who have a ton of muscle behind them. Remember, even Macklemore, an independent artist who scored a huge hit with \u201cThrift Shop\u201d without a label, HIRED a huge record label\u2019s sales and promotions department to push him to radio (which is a model worth looking into). Once you find your way onto a radio stations playlist, you have just a few \u201cspins\u201d (I\u2019ve heard as little as 1\u20133 times on air), before your song\u2019s performance will be tested. Unless the song tests very high, you\u2019ll be cut out of rotation very quickly. One good method of garnering radio play for lesser known artists (that are still signed) that I\u2019ve seen applied by some labels is that they will go to a market and \u201cpitch\u201d a show to a local station, offering their artist to come and perform for free, letting the station \u201cown\u201d the event. Often times, they\u2019ll bundle several up and coming acts on one show. (In my case, they brought Luke Bryan and a few other acts for free to play a show.) Then, the radio station advertises the concert pretty mercilessly, which includes playing the artist\u2019s songs on the radio. (But, once again, this only works if there is heat behind these acts to begin with.) ",

            "answer_text": "Most stations use a \u201cplaylist\u201d that is either created by the Music Director or, increasingly, by the chain that owns the station (I Heart Radio, Entercom, Cumulus, etc.). They only play about 15 new songs, so they only add a couple each week. They are almost always from big record labels\u2014which is a little complicated. There are actually hundreds of record labels, but they are all DISTRIBUTED by Universal, Sony, or Warner. So, unless you are on one of their labels, your music will be ignored. Now, occasionally, stations will pick up on something new and different. It\u2019s usually a local artist who they think has national potential. Lots of examples of that in the old days, but now it has to be something that went viral on YouTube, etc. Now, there are college stations, community radio stations, and local music shows on commercial stations that will play \u201cindie music.\u201d They don\u2019t have big audiences, and you aren\u2019t going to sell thousands of CDs or downloads as a result. But I know people who made a decent living without almost any radio play. They distribute their own music via CDs or downloads, often selling discs at concerts. That\u2019s the most likely way to make a living from music. Your chances of making it through national radio play are about 1 in a million, maybe 1 in ten thousand if you are really really good. ",
