            "answer_text": "The accordion is hard to simulate, even with a synthesiser, because there is a subtle difference between the \u2018in\u2019 and the \u2018out\u2019 sound. I\u2019ve been playing guitar-synth for about twenty-eight years, first with the Roland GR-700 and then with the Roland GK system into Roland GR and Axon midi-converters. I tried the accordion sound a few times, but never got something which actually made it sound like an accordion player, like you would perhaps hear at the start of The Boy in the Bubble on Paul Simon\u2019s Graceland. The Boy In the Bubble For such a despised instrument, accordion becomes something that you more or less have to have done acoustically if you want it to sound like accordion. This is especially ironic, because there have been electric Farfisa accordions since the 1960s. However, they were never designed to sound like accordions, but were rather electric organs for accordion players. Roland does actually make digital accordions (The Piano Accordion goes digital) but you still need an accordion player to play one. Syntheway makes a VST / AU accordion plugin that sounds pretty good on the demo, though I haven\u2019t used it myself: Virtual Accordion, Concertina, Bandoneon, Harmonica and Melodica You could certainly drive one of these from a Roland GK pickup and appropriate midi-converter. I\u2019m fairly certain that there is no combination of effects pedals short of a midi-converter which can produce a realistic accordion sound. ",

            "answer_text": "How can I make a guitar sound like an accordion using effects? I think the only solution would be to get a MIDI pickup and controller and accordion patch on a synthesizer. A lot of people go the Rolland route for this, as their guitar-to-MIDI systems have a good track record and are affordable, relatively speaking. I used to own one. It was quite a bit of fun, especially for keyboard patches, which can be very convincing.   If an organ will do, there are some stomp boxes that can emulate an organ sound, like this one:   ",
