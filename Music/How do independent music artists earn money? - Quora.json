            "answer_text": "In my experience, I believe the way to succeed as an independent musician is to run your band as an actual business. Obviously, this requires someone in the band to have some knowledge and education about running a business. The music business is unique but many basic principles of business will apply to music. You need a business plan and everyone involved needs to be on the same page. The ideal time to do this for most people is when you are in your late teens or early 20s, because at that age, many people do not yet have to deal with typical adult responsibilities like rent, or full time jobs. However when starting out it is quite important that everyone in the band has a source of income because most likely unless you have family members willing to loan you money for your business venture, you will have to save and contribute out of pocket. Starting out, any money you make will be from playing live gigs and that won\u2019t be much when you are starting out. Some more skilled musicians play with cover bands to make extra money, others will teach lessons, etc. I am pretty sure if a band had a detailed plan and a long term agenda of common goals, they can succeed if they collectively spent 40 hours a week working towards their band making it. This could include some rehearsal time but most of this time should be spent in band meetings and educating yourself in the business and networking with other musicians you know. To get gigs you need a demo and once you have merch and a full album released, then you have a product you can send to press outlets, radio stations, publicists, and something you can sell at shows and online. If you are not on a record label you have to do all of this work yourself which is overwhelming if you don\u2019t know what to do, which is why continuous education is so important. If you are not hard at work recording new music, you should be constantly playing gigs, touring, and promoting your latest release. If you are a serious band you should have band meetings every week to discuss you future agenda. Everyone should still have their primary source of income but if you are making progress, every band member should see their business investment paying off a little. You start getting better gigs opening for bigger bands, you effectively take advantage of big opportunities like festival slots and you can grow your fanbase quicker. Whats extremely important is that you continue playing live, and continue releasing new music, and stay in touch with your fanbase. Conduct yourself professionally and play out in as many different cities as possible. If you can fill venues, they will always book you anywhere. When big time industry people notice a band able to tour on their own and move their entire inventory of records, that is the time you can think about a record deal. And more importantly, a band in that position does not necessarily need a label and they have all the leverage to negotiate whatever terms they want in a recording contract.,, ",

            "answer_text": "The cheeky answer is: we don't. The honest answer might be: by any means possible. The real answer is: hard work, determination, and just the right amount of compromise.  yup. It's all good when you live with your parents, you're in a steely eyed and determined post-hardcore band and you nevber have want for food, a roof and have no one depending on you, but when you get a little older and suddenly need to support yourself (and maybe others) you need to step up your game if you want to do it. Also, whoever is along for the ride - whether it be a romantic partner, bandmates, whatever...need to understand it may be a rough ride so that you can still do this.   Personally - I make most of my money from live work. i'm lucky enough to have some regular gigs, a network of venues I play at, a booking agent, and dependable transportation networks to do it. not to toot my own horn, but I'm also good at what i do and professional. I don't cancel, i don't disappoint, i don't arrive hung over or drunk or high, and I have good equipment.  If you can manage to record your own music, or at least pay studio fees and mixing and mastering (and eventually maybe pressing) and break even, it's kind of a success. selling iot hand to hand at shows to fans at a fair price is a success. selling the downloads without being in the hole to an agent is a success. I don't make a dime of Spotify, youtube or RDIO. fact. Bandcamp - yes.   merchandise like t-shirts, bags , stickers...etc. can be risky. especially if no-one buys it. you do need to have records out though. thats important. sometimes people just want to have the artifact in their hand if they support you.  I will say though that it's very important that you are tenacious, brave and confident (but not overly brash - no-one actually likes a douche-bag). it's just important that you're ready to work to make money. you're gonna hopefully get out of it, what you put into it.
