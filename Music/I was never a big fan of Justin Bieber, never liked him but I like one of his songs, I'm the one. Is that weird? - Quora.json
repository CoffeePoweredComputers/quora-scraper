            "answer_text": "Well, seeing as that would be a DJ Khaled song, no it isn\u2019t weird at all. I also like that song , and it has shot up the charts like crazy, so we are not the only people to enjoy it. Khaled has produced many hit songs for various artists over the years, and shows no signs of stopping . If you are feeling self concious about the fact that it features Bieber, focus on the other featured artists Little Wayne, Chance the Rapper, and Quavo. Migos and Chance are huge right now. ",

            "answer_text": "If you like a song, you like it. It's as simple as that. I'm not a big fan of J.B.'s work, but that doesn't mean I will automatically dislike anything he releases. I'll listen to it and if I consider that the song is well made, I don't mind who has made it, who sung it... As in so many other areas of life, there is nothing wrong with having an open mind, as far as music is concerned. ",
