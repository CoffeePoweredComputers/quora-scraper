            "answer_text": "The term you are looking for is Royalty Free, but finding the right music and the right source and file types may prove difficult. There are many collections behind paywalls. Consider making your own music in GarageBand, all the loops and instruments that come with it are royalty free so any music you make with it is yours. There are also companies that produce sounds and loops and instruments. Read the fine print. If you cannot fully own the work when you produce with their loops, hard pass. You can use up to 30 seconds of commercial music, but there are also some other exclusions to copywriter under Fair Use. So look up fair use and learn about satire, original to new works, etc. Consult an atty if you are uncertain. This is not legal advice, it is simply advice. Do your own research. Have fun making films. ",
