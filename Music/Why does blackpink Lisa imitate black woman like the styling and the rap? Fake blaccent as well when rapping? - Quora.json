            "answer_text": "The replies are kind of funny. I see what the other commenters are saying about black women not being a monolith so \u201cspeaking like a black woman\u201d is problematic phrasing. That being said, 100% Lisa does use a blaccent when rapping. It\u2019s a big problem in kpop in general, especially in YG. (I\u2019ve noticed the the rap line as a whole is guilty of this; I\u2019ve heard Jennie use a blaccent now and then too, but considering she doesn\u2019t do nearly as much English rapping and this question isn\u2019t about her, I\u2019m focusing on Lisa.) It\u2019s getting a bit weird how the fans keep denying it as one of the other repliers did\u2014 \u201cbecause she\u2019s imitating American rappers\u201d. Like yeah, American rappers that are black! The whole model of hip-hop presentation that YG uses was lifted from BLACK Americans; from the hairstyles, to the clothes, to the mannerisms, and yes\u2014 vocal inflection too! Lisa doesn\u2019t speak that way irl, we know that. And using a \u201cwestern hip hop voice\u201d is what we in the West call a blaccent. That\u2019s literally what it is. The replies are kind of gaslighting OP with the classic \u201cIt\u2019s not racist, YOU\u2019RE racist for bringing it up.\u201d OP was calling out Lisa\u2019s *intention* (whether conscious or subconcious) to \u201csound black\u201d, not necessarily suggesting that they think \u201csounding black\u201d is actually possible. We all know it\u2019s not, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from trying. And that attempt is called using a blaccent. If you still can\u2019t hear or understand the problem, then there\u2019s more about either black (American) culture or systemic racism (or both) that you need to understand. This conversation goes way beyond kpop, and Kpop isn\u2019t a conversation in the west the way race/racism is. So if you want Western success for BP, better for the fans to educate them now than other people who\u2019ve gotten a bad impression of them later. I really wish the fans would stop trying to downplay and defend it because it\u2019s not going to help her or the group in the long run. We\u2019ve already seen how much pressure it takes to have YG fix something for the girls when it\u2019s wrong, so if the fans keep defending this then that leaves only non-fans and antis to correct the behaviour, and, unlike Lillies, they won\u2019t try to defend Lisa or her feelings while doing it. And worse, if this denial continues, Blinks will just end up barking down (probably mostly black) people when they call it out. Imagine that? An army of Blinks speaking over black people to defend anti-blackness. Lol the fandom would look so incredibly racist. This blaccent business is a hard pill to swallow, but let\u2019s just hurry up and swallow it because cultural appropriation seems to be one of the main things causing problems for this group whenever they finally do put something out. Lisa is my bias since debut so I promise I\u2019m not happy about this either. I genuinely think she\u2019s good with rap and exceeds expectations with whatever she\u2019s given, but the blaccent (\u201cwestern sound\u201d) is completely unnecessary and doesn\u2019t add anything to her raps. And whatever it is that she/YG/the producers think it adds, it isn\u2019t anything that she couldn\u2019t add with her own charisma. And it isn\u2019t necessary to legitimize the verse as \u201crap\u201d or \u201chip hop\u201d. If anything, it detracts from the listening experience for me because the accent is clearly put-on and it sometimes reminds me of Iggy. So I hope things change. And I hope this gives a different/new perspective for some of you who don\u2019t see the problem. ",

            "answer_text": "I won't say she imitates black women. This question is very badly worded and stereotypical to black women. I will say lisa does have a very hiphop image that the stylists and YG try to bring out. They give her bold looks, similar to many western styles. Her rap is rap. I hope I dont offend anybody ,blinks or readers, but lisa is a good rapper but her and jennie's flow is very much the typical ,if u compare it to Nicky Minaj's animated rap or moonbyul(mamamoo's) low and calm rap, u will notice the difference. Lisa stands out in kpop because she has incredible energy. But her flow or rap style and bars arent something that stand out, they are very common to me, her attitude is what attracts me. That being said, I dont think lisa is copying anyone. Now the braids in KTL, yes I heard they were yarn but I do think it was meant to look like braids of black culture. I don't think lisa is imitating black women. I do think her stylist are influenced by western styles, and for her rapping\u2026its not a unique flow, it's a style that's been done by many so she isnt imitating anyone. But the times lisa was called out for cultural appropriation, I'm not surprised cuz kpop idols,labels and stylists dont do research or educate themselves when setting up for comebacks. Lisa herself isnt imitating anyone. But kpop as whole is influenced by many things including western music and kpop has appropriated looks or cultural elements before. Now I shall give credit to black culture as one of the biggest influences of many industries like fashion and music industry. The west is definitely influenced by black culture in so many ways, I do think stylists of blackpink do have to be careful how they style lisa or the members because the braids in KTL was questionable to many. I dont think lisa is imitating black women or the culture but she is an idol rapper so I do hope she respects the culture. I'm sure she does tho but still The question could have been worded better. Simply ask something like \u201cDo you think blackpink lisa's image is cultural appropriation?\u201d Or something like that. I dont know but the original question is very stereotypical and offensive.
