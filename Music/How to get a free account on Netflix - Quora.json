But if you don\u2019t have such unused credit card then there is literally no way to get Netflix for free. I previously got Netflix at about 75% discount from SplitandChill . I really liked their service. It was very easy and hassle free. I believe they are still operating so you might wanna check that out. If you search \u201cfree netflix\u201d on Google or YouTube you will find hundreds of people giving tricks of getting Free Netflix. Before you spends dozens of hours or maybe many days trying to figure out why these tricks don\u2019t work for you, let me tell you one simple fact. Those tricks do not work. Tricks that do not work anymore:- Virtual Cards or Prepaid cards : Some months back people discovered that they can create unlimited virtual or prepaid cards using various websites on internet. Then using these cards they can get unlimited free trials. However, Netflix soon found out what\u2019s going on. Nowadays, Netflix won\u2019t even let you register using a prepaid card. And even if by some miracle you are able to get a Free trial, it will get suspended in less than a week.Cookies : Not the ones you eat. LOL. Some websites provide cookies extracted from actual working netflix accounts. When you add these cookies in your browser you will be able to access netflix even without any login and can watch for free. However, out of hundreds of websites, containing hundreds of cookies each, only a few actually work. Plus you need to have some level of technical knowledge, plus you can play only on laptop. If you are a student or unemployed or just have too much time to waste then you can use this method.Shady people selling accounts at very cheap price: They are ways like dictionary attacks, brute force attacks or other kinds of hacks using which some people are able to crack passwords of genuine accounts. These hackers then sell these accounts for very cheap. However , first the actual account owner can change the password anytime and you will lose access. Second, this is highly illegal. Accounts contain credit card info. Hacking financial information can put you in jail for 2\u20133 years.If you have 3 other friends then one of you can buy Netflix Premium subscription. This guy can pay using his credit card. You can pay this guy in cash or whatever way you wish. This way you can get Netflix Premium access at 75% less price. Except this doesn't really workout. Does it ? Not all of us have dependable friends/family members with whom we can share our bill and expect them to pay on time. If they even pay at all !Moreover, most of us are not even comfortable asking our loved ones to pay their share.In the end, you just end up with relationships gone sour and friends getting hurt. Or Worse. Paying the whole bill yourself.Even if everything works out, it's just way too much hassle. \"Ain't nobody got time for that!\"And, many of us just don't wanna let friends/family know what we are watching. You know, there are some pretty hot and steamy stuff available on stream !",

Before you spends dozens of hours or maybe many days trying to figure out why these tricks don\u2019t work for you, let me tell you one simple fact. Those tricks do not work. Few methods that I know of:- 1. Netflix used to give first month free trial. Not anymore in India. Netflix has disabled free trials in some countries, so it depends on where you are. If in your country Netflix where is still giving free trials and if you have a credit or debit card that you haven\u2019t used with Netflix, then using this card you can get your free trial. After that you can ask for card of your parents, siblings, wife, cousins etc and probably you can get few more months of additional free trials. 2. Now, if you are specifically looking for Free subscription only then let me tell you nothing in this world is free. If someone is giving or promising you something for free, then be prepared to get scammed.I did a hell lot of research on internet on this trying to find ways to get subscriptions for free. And honestly, all I got were scams or time getting wasted. I have literally wasted days searching for methods to get free subscriptions. I have gone through all YouTube videos and websites promising working tricks of getting subscription for free. And I can tell you with absolute surety that none of those tricks work ! 4. If you have 3 other friends then one of you can buy Netflix Premium subscription. This guy can pay using his credit card. You can pay this guy in cash or whatever way you wish. This way you can get Netflix Premium access at 75% less price If you use only mobile then you can just buy INR 199/- Mobile only plan. This is very cheap. Netflix is also testing a Mobile plus plan @ INR 349/- by which you can watch Netflix on Mobile and Laptop, but not on TV. Also, it won\u2019t be Ultra HD. But if you wish to get the Netflix Premium Ultra HD then it will cost you INR 799. The Premium Plan allowed 4 screens i.e 4 people can watch at once. So if you have three other friends or family members then you can share with them. This way it will cost you as low as INR 200. Below are the results of my research Virtual Credit Cards (VCC) or Prepaid cards \u2013 do not work anymore: Few months back people discovered that they can create unlimited virtual or prepaid cards using various websites on internet. Then using these cards, they can get unlimited free trials. However, companies soon found out what\u2019s going on. Nowadays, streaming companies won\u2019t even let you register using a prepaid card. And even if by some miracle you are able to get a Free trial, it will get suspended in less than a week. Cookies \u2013 do not work anymore: Not the ones you eat. LOL. Some websites provide cookies extracted from actual working netflix accounts. When you add these cookies in your browser you will be able to access netflix even without any login and can watch for free. However, out of hundreds of websites, containing hundreds of cookies each, only a few actually work. Plus you need to have some level of technical knowledge, plus you can play only on laptop. If you are a student or unemployed or just have too much time to waste then you can use this method. Apps promising free streaming access \u2013 you will get blackmailed: Stay away from these. There is no real app that can give you free access to streaming services. All such apps are designed to steal data from your phone. They can steal all your messages, contacts, photos, passwords etc. There are many instances where people lost all they money or were blackmailed using their intimate photos. There are also many scammers use social media like Instagram, Facebook, Telegram etc. They will tell you to that they provide streaming subscriptions at like 200 INR etc but they are thieves on internet. They will take your money and will never reply. But the dangerous part is this. Many such sellers do provide accounts, but they use stolen credit cards to create accounts. This is extremely dangerous and illegal. Buying/selling stolen credit cards, or items purchased using stolen cards is highly illegal. As per IT Act 2000, Section 66, you can go to jail for 3 years. If you have 3 other friends then one of you can buy Netflix Premium subscription. This guy can pay using his credit card. You can pay this guy in cash or whatever way you wish. This way you can get Netflix Premium access at 75% less price. ",

No commitments, cancel anytime. Netflix (at least in the UK) doesn\u2019t allow account sharing and it is also against US law. \u201cJailbreaking\u201d which I see has been added as a topic would also be illegal in this case and out of context, that not normally refers to iOS devices. However it does seem to be tolerated by Netflix, this could be because they prefer to focus on growing subscriber numbers and going after customers who password share they may have determined would overall have a negative impact on this. Although it may also be possible that based on previously available technology they determined it wasn\u2019t worth the time and development/analysis to identify when account/password sharing is in place, but could soon be changing. Share Netflix account ## Is account sharing allowed and legal? - TrustATec Are you allowed to share your Netflix account -or not? What do the terms and conditions actually mean? Ultimately, it means that it is not allowed to share the password or account details with third parties. As you are not allowed to share your login details, you log in to the device of your friends or family members. E-mail and password are stored on the device, so they no longer need to be entered. Then each user creates his own profile. For this you go to \u201cAccount\u201d / \u201cmy profile\u201d / \u201cManage profiles\u201d. It is important to have a clear name for the profile, so that it will not be confused later. Why sharing your Netflix password with pals could mean you're a criminal IT is something we all do but sharing your password with friends could be a crime. You may voluntarily give the password to, for example, a streaming service but that could trigger a prosecution under America's computer hacking laws. Though it might seem a harmless and friendly thing to do, a court ruled sharing passwords constitutes an offence. The ruling came after an employee of the recruitment firm joined a competitor. David Nosal persuaded former colleagues to let them use their password to access his old work computer. He lost a 10 year legal battle after the US Supreme Court threw out his case a few weeks ago and is now serving a prison sentence. The legal precedent is set that under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you can\u2019t access a system you are not allowed to, whether or not you were given the password by an authorised user. The legislation has been described as \u2018the worst law in technology\u2019. As Nosal\u2019s case wound its way through the courts, one judge also took that the law could criminalise ordinary people. Stephen Reinhardt said \"this case is about password sharing\" not hacking. \"People frequently share their passwords, notwithstanding the fact that websites and employers have policies prohibiting it,\" he said. The law \"threatens to criminalise all sorts of innocuous conduct engaged in daily by ordinary citizens\" including those who share passwords for streaming sites. It appears, however, all the appeals have run their course and sharing passwords can be a crime. So the next time your flatmate asks for the Netflix password, you might want to think twice.  ",

I don't know if there's different packages with different prices, but I know I pay $10 a month to have unlimited streaming on 2 different televisions at the same time. You can have movies mailed to you too, I believe, but I don't know how much more it costs. Your best bet is to try netflix for that month, make sure you know when your month is up so you don't have to pay, and see if you enjoy having it. If you do, keep it, and Netflix will bill you monthy. I swear everything I pay is on autopay because I have a terrible memory, and Netflix is the only one to be consistent on the time and day it comes out. They have a lot of great original programming and some really good movies. Just this month they added Finding Dory and Magic Mike! Start your free trial. What do you have to lose?!? ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, watch something with someone who pays for it. Why try getting Netflix for free? It\u2019s a whole lot cheaper than most of the cable stations and you don\u2019t have to deal with advertisements or commercials. Also, ever since they created their very first original series \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d which turned out to be a huge success, they\u2019ve made hundreds of other original series and movies which are great. I love Netflix and have done so ever since it came out in DVDs and mailed to our homes. It demolished BlockBuster video stores because they were getting too greedy when they started charging late fees and having to go over there to pick up and return the movies. Also, too often many of the most popular movies wouldn\u2019t even be available on the stands. Netflix would mail the movies free of charge both ways and you could keep the DVD as long as you want to without any late fees. You just have to mail it back in order to get the next one which would always show up asap. Now you don\u2019t even have to order them on DVD unless you want to, but that costs a little more if you want that. Netflix has so many series and movies made by both Hollywood along with its own originals on its own station on TV. You can watch them anywhere anytime on your television, computer, laptop and cell phone. Why be cheap or try to steal it? You\u2019re getting a bargain. ",

It takes quite a bit of money to issue handsome paychecks to all these people, who work behind the scenes delivering content to the world.  Due to the $6.5 billion in operating expenses they incur each year, them being a for-profit company and having investors who expect a return on their investment, they regret that they are unable to give the service away for free. Had you been in their shoes, would you? Plans start at $7.99 per month in the US and may vary slightly internationally. That\u2019s about the cost of a burger and fries.

            "answer_text": "The most obvious options would be to use your free trials. You can even create multiple accounts to use up free trials for a while, I think it should work for around 3\u20134 months. However, there is a limit to how many times you can do that. I think after a while Netflix still recognizes your IP address even if you signed up using a completely new email, and you stop being eligible for free trials. So you can only have a free account on Netflix for so long. But you might want to look into getting a premium account with your friends. That way, the subscription fee is shared among all of you who sign up, and you won\u2019t have to pay as much. This is really efficient because you still get to enjoy all the premium benefits but at a very minimal cost. So you might want to consider this option. ",

            "answer_text": " Netflix does not have a policy of a free account as such, but it might be possible if Netflix does a giveaway for its audience and provides a free account in some way. Only way to use a free account with Netflix is to use your credit card details and sign up with Netflix. Doing so will let you use the service for free for one month, after a month Netflix will charge you on your subscription account based on the plan you wish to subscribe for. Please see the list of plans available with Netflix below  You can cancel your subscription after a month and sign up again with new details to watch content on Netflix again a month for free. Honestly, suggest to get one plan for yourself to avoid all this hassle. Also the subscription charges are not that expensive to buy. Starting from $7.99- $13.99. Moreover, if you have a generous friend, relative or someone close to you who would be generous enough to lend you his or her Netflix account, that way you can get a free Netflix account to use. Since with Netflix\u2019s Standard and Premium plan one account can be used on 2 or 4 screens at one time. ",

My daughter let me have a profile on her account, and she has access to my Hulu account. Or you could offer to split the cost with someone, it would only be like $7 bucks a month for 2 people. And Netflix doesn't care who the 5 people are that are watching on each account. The contract States \u201cup to five family members and five devices\". Family can have a pretty broad meaning. I mean, my cats are like family members, lol. They just care about the account getting paid every month. ",

Membership is well worth the price in comparison to other video on-demand services and especially satellite / cable services depending on what you wish to watch. One way you might be able to get it for free is through the ability to create a profile on an existing Netflix account, and the person who pays the bill might not charge you for using it lets say if you\u2019re on good terms. I know a number of people who share their Netflix with friends and family who either pay a small percentage back to the account holder, or just piggy back off an existing account used within the same household. Depends on your situation. ",

You pay, we get more of it.Everyone who DOESN\u2019T pay makes the fees raise for the rest. It\u2019s reverse socialism. That makes you a dickhead.It\u2019s like stealing music. Like, really? One can\u2019t go to Amazon and pay .80 -$1.09 for a song they like? REALLY? They\u2019re fans\u2026but not fans enough to actually support the artists? That\u2019s some bullshit - and it\u2019s bad karma. If you steal, you\u2019ll get stolen from. Your car may get broken into, your wallet taken, your house robbed. That\u2019s how life works. What you put into the universe, you get back. Just pay for it. It\u2019s less than $3.50 a week for Netflix. ",

What you have to do is go to www.netflix.com, and sign up by creating a new account. Now opt for the free month trial, and you will get access to the content for free. Stream as much as you like that too in HD quality. However, you have to cancel the subscription before the trial period ends. Make sure to cancel the subscription, and you won\u2019t be charged anything. If the period exceeds even one day after the trial, then you will be charged for the services. This is a working way that comes attached with risks. The best way is to set a reminder in your smartphone about canceling the subscription if you don\u2019t want to get charged. I think that you need to try XOOMTV, because it\u2019s cheap and offers you to watch shows from so many streaming platforms in one place. ",

Before the end of month, deactivate the account and sign up another email ID and enter the same card details. Since, one month trial is free, multiple email acounts means multiple free months. If available in your country, select payment method by phone number or such alternatives to avoid giving card details. Personally, I pay for Netflix but my friend is a free loader but he uses phone number as the payment option and stays in region which allows such payment method, not disclosing here but it's a region 2 country.

Netflix could have gone the route of offering it\u2019s services with commercials, but we see how well that\u2019s been received with other services. They would have to hunt down and secure sponsors, those sponsors would likely have some editorial or creative control, the need for more aggressive sponsorship would rise\u2026. By offering their service for a low monthly fee, they not only have the freedom to explore the original content they want to secure and produce, but they know they have that incoming revenue stream that helps them do it. They also count on that stream to fun lic. purchases for all the movies they offer. If they were just a commercial-run service, studios and producers would have little to no reason to treat them any differently than any other cable network. Netflix, by it\u2019s very nature, gets to take chances. They get to produce eight episodes of a quirky mockumentry, making fun of true crime dramas. They get to secure the exclusive US rights to some wickedly funny UK comedy, or some truly thought-provoking sci-fi from Brazil. They\u2019ve found that a low-monthly fee can provide them with the means to be successful and give them the freedom to grow. ",

The streaming service requires hosting on multiple servers all over the world and internet bandwidth to provide a good a experience - that costs money. Netflix does not earn money out of advertisements - we get the content without interruption. Netflix is a commercial company that exists to make profit - that it is making losses is besides the point. Netflix is not funded by any government or institution. They have salaries to pay to employees. So where will the money come from? ",
