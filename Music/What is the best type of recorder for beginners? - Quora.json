            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question, but one that is unanswerable, because you give us no information upon which to consider an answer. What experience do you have, with recorder, with other instruments, with reading music, with listening to music? Any of this might have been helpful. What are you looking to do with the recorder? For that matter, when you type the word \u201crecorder\u201d are you thinking of the musical instrument, a machine that records, a bird that sings a particular way (the term \u201crecorder\u201d was used for the instrument which was generically known as \u201cflute\u201d before the German Flute, or Transverse Flute (flautist traverso) became the more commonly used flute, because \u201crecording\u201d, in English, meant the kind of singing that birds did. Are you considering adding a recorder to your collection? Perhaps a different manufacturer or maker? Are you displeased with the recorder you have? Or are you considering taking up the instrument because it is reputed to be easy, and you want to play an instrument, or that it is reputed to be difficult and you seek a challenge? (I often repeat, the Recorder is the easiest instrument to learn to play, and the hardest to learn to play well!) Are you going to take lessons? (Usually, then your teacher will be the best person to recommend what to get). Are you intending to teach yourself? Have you chosen (or have you been chosen by) a particular book you intend to use? Without any information other than what we can glean from your question, that you are seeking something called \u201crecorder\u201d and want help deciding what to get, we can\u2019t even begin to help you.

            "answer_text": "Most people seem to prefer to begin with a soprano recorder. However, it should be noted that it has a rather shrill sound, and most of the music written for the recorder at the height of its popularity during the Baroque era was in fact intended for the alto, which has a mellower and altogether far more pleasant sound. Thus I would suggest to adult beginners to begin with the alto. For children, with their smaller hands, this may not be an option. ",
