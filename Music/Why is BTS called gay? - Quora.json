            "answer_text": "They wear more makeup Korean/Asian male celebrities use more makeup than most Western male celebrities. In Korea, men wearing makeup is common, and like BTS, they are K-pop idols, which means most of the time, flashy outfits and stage, bright smooth pale skin, red or pink lips are concepts of how an idol would look like. The typical korean/asian beauty standard usually includes \u2018pretty boys\u2019 or guys with boyish, young and innocent looks. The members of BTS have such image, even though the concepts of their album or songs do change, but regardlessthey wear eyeliner, foundation, eyeshadow, liptints in interviews, shows, music videos and especially concerts or performance etc. My American friend mentioned to me that Western male celebrities don\u2019t wear eyeliner as much like K-pop idols, and I myself noticed it then. The makeup the BTS members wore at BBMA 2017 awards was quite light compared to their usual makeup. Just because they are wearing makeup, some call them \u2018gay\u2019 as though it\u2019s a negative term because people still think most boys aren\u2019t supposed to wear them. V (Kim TaeHyung) from DNA Poster As you can see, there\u2019s eyeshadow, liptint, foundation, glitter and eyeliner etc You can watch RM and Suga\u2019s response to B-Free after he disrespected male rapper/idols for wearing makeup, contrary to what a typical underground rapper would do.   A makeup artist touching up Suga\u2019s makeup backstage 2. They like to touch each other They show their affection for one another quite obviously, the group are close and have been training together for years. They won\u2019t start eating until all 7 members have arrived at the table (BTS Bon Voyage Episode 4) and they like to touch or play with each other physically. This video explains much and just shows all their skinships.  3. They have androgynous facesSimilar to point 1 and like maybe 98% of K-pop male idols, they have gentle and pretty faces and images. 4. They are not afraid to talk about LGBT Rights LGBT is honestly not talked about that much in Korea or Asia, so the fact that their management company allows the members to talk about LGBT or mental health issues, it\u2019s quite uncommon. Furthermore, Suga mentioned that \u2018I don\u2019t have an ideal type, it\u2019s not limited to girls\u201d got fans believing he was indirectly saying that he was bisexual but he has yet to confirm it and to be honest, probably won\u2019t.

            "answer_text": "The answer is simple. They are popular. Like really popular so people obviously get jealous and bad mouth them. They look cute, does not have big muscles or moustache or beards. They look feminine and soft. They are south east asians, so when 20,000 years ago another evolution happened, people from their side (Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and etc) evolved in a way that they ended up having somewhat baby like soft features and in fact, the evolution is the reason why most Korean, Japanese and other south east asian men seems to have female like features. It's evolution. (See Bright Side's youtube video for more info.) They are touchy with one another. The reason lies in the culture of Korea. Now I used to find this weird in the beginning too but I found out the reason behind this thanks to a Korean fan who explained that skinship (the word they use to define physical contact) is very common between people they are really close to. BTS isn't the muscular sexy boy band. If BTS was a really muscular type of boy band like 2PM they probably wouldn't be called or seen as gay but the times are changing and most girls nowadays like cute looking boys instead of rough and tough muscular guys. Every country have different preferences though. That's why RM who in some countries is seen as the least good looking in BTS, is considered the most handsome in some. The places people find RM attractive, usually find Jimin and Jungkook not that manly. And vice versa. ",
