            "answer_text": "\u201cBeautifully\u201d is a subjective evaluation, difficult or impossible to quantify. In general, I would say that Chopin\u2019s music never forsakes its link to the \u201chigh classical\u201d approach, a Mozart-like view of purity, straightforward nobility, unforced elegance, avoidance of glitter, hiding complexity behind simplicity, using decoration as an integral part of the melodic flow. Chopin;s music is quintessentially pianistic, and is virtually impossible to translate into any other medium. Chopin manages to use some daring dissonances that are miraculously tempered by his understanding and use of the natural overtones of the piano - the \u201cunwritten notes\u201d that fit in with the \u201cwritten notes\u201d. The sustaining pedal does not generate these overtones, but can only enhance them. This characteristic is one of Chopin\u2019s secrets for beauty. This characteristic is his discovery of how the piano works as a suggestive instrument. This characteristic makes Chopin\u2019s music hard to transcribe effectively for orchestra without making it sound brazen or overly tame. Chopin\u2019s Nocturnes are universally admired, next only to his waltzes, as perennial masterpieces. There is no universal agreement on how they should be performed, or even as to what they represent besides pure music. Certainly, there are glimpses of a personal diary, of some patriotic or ethnic debts, of atmospheric dreams, of echoes of voices, of mystery and friendship, of tenderness and protest. But these are fleeting shadows. The music itself has an imperturbable flow, and there is not one shred of vulgarity, bad taste or posture in its unfurling. Just to play them is fairly easy. To discover their fragrance and their essence is a job for a lifetime. The slightest imperfection, imbalance, excess or unexplained reticence will scar the surface and disturb the contents. Even the best interpreters will not claim to have achieved perfection. A good approach would be: play them without sentimentality or any exaggeration. Remember that pianos in Chopin\u2019s day had a lower volume. Be faithful to the score : remember that Chopin himself was always somewhat annoyed when people took liberties with his score, even though he himself made additions and changes in his own music for some of his students. All my suggestions assume that you already know the music inside out, have worked on each hand separately, used the best choice of fingering to suit your hands, figured out how to use pedals effectively, but with great restraint, read a great deal about Chopin\u2019s own views on his music and the impressions of his contemporaries, and listened to some superior recordings, ",

You would want to be able to maintain a singing melodic line, a well-restrained accompaniment, and a sensible legato touch\u2014 and not bang on the keys, even in a passage that\u2019s marked forte or fortissimo. You would also want to pedal with clarity, and phrase everything according to what is written on the score. As a starter, you would generally want to steer away from inserting your own rubato\u2014 because they will probably not going to sound as good as you thought. Practice your nocturne in strict time, add the rubato later, and use it sparingly. You would want to avoid trying to reinvent the wheel. Listen to recordings, so you will understand what a piece should sound like. You would, ideally, want to play your nocturne for your teacher, because even if you have followed all the guidelines of good Chopin playing, it will be difficult to tell how well you have implemented these guidelines, and what physical/musical adjustments that you should make, given the amount of deviation that was built-into your playing.

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t try too hard. By far the biggest mistake that pianists make when approaching Chopin\u2019s nocturnes is trying to inject too much personality via excessive rubato. Chopin\u2019s nocturnes as they exist on the page are already among the most lyrical, most beautiful pieces in a pianist\u2019s repertoire. As such, most of the hard work is already done - the pianist doesn\u2019t actually have to work that hard in realizing a beautiful performance. The difference between Rubinstein\u2019s and Lang Lang\u2019s interpretations of Chopin\u2019s nocturnes is particularly instructive in this regard. I\u2019ve always believed that Rubinstein is regarded as the foremost interpreter of Chopin expressly because he does more with less. When I listen to his performances, I\u2019m always surprised by the frugality with which he applies rubato and pedaling. By contrast, Lang Lang seems to be of the opinion that you can never have enough of either. ",

And as other replies suggest listened to a few recordings for an interpretation that moves you\u2026 HOWEVER - it must be pointed out that Chopin composed on piano-fortes which were typically wood framed and not quite as powerfully developed as modern instruments: which are much louder - plus modern piano hammer felts tend to be hard - so \u2018pp\u2019 playing generates \u2018ff\u2019 harmonics\u2026 - I once played a Broadwood grand from ~1848 which I was told Chopin had played\u2026. The sound was rounder. smaller and the compass of the keyboard was also reduced: overall tonally much more authentic to what the compose might have achieved. ",

Also don\u2019t forget to listen to the recording of the interpretation which suits your taste most. Listen to it for many times. You\u2019ll be much affected. Easy to say, but quite hard to do.
