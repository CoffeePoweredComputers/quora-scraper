            "answer_text": "Are you listening to music that triggers emotions in yourself? In fact- I would listen to music alone - as being around living people is far better spent talking and listening to each other. Unless discussing musical structure for later compositions? And then there is social music that makes you wanna dance. Are you afraid that the music will make you get up and look silly? ",

I want to share the music I enjoy\u2026but I read once a teacher should never teach a novel they like. Music would be even worse: deadly to not strike a chord. I litter my Quora answers w/clips as \u2018evidence\u2019 of good music, according to Bruce. But, yeah, more than anything I\u2019d hope a gal enjoyed my taste. But\u2026I\u2019d get out to a concert of your choice just to meet-and-greet, maybe you\u2019d find something in common? ",
