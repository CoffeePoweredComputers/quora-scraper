            "answer_text": "As my mentor always told, a piano ages gracefully with time. A 30 year old piano sounds more richer and has a more regal tone, but it also depends on the make of the piano. If its a Pearl River, i wouldn't have my hopes too high as they are of a modest build. On the other hand, if it's a steinway or a Kawai, don't even think of selling it. Marry your piano :) ",
