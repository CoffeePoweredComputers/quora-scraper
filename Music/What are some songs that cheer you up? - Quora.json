All I know is that, as a 40 something \u201cgrown-ass-man\u201d, I have never been ashamed to say that every now and then, I need a little \u201cMMMBop\u201d in my life! :-) I\u2019m not sure exactly why, but this song always makes me smile, and it never fails to get me out of whatever \u201cfunk\u201d I\u2019m in! :-) I think it might have something to do with being rebellious\u2026. The act of being unapologetic about loving something that everyone else hates, knowing that only YOU control the volume\u2026. BBWWAAAHAAHAAHAA! :-) It\u2019s also just a happy, upbeat, catchy tune! :-) On a lighter note, I do have a theory! :-) I think a lot of people are still a little \u201cbutt-hurt\u201d because they were attracted to Taylor Hanson in the music video back in 1997\u2026. Until they found out \u201cshe\u201d was a 13 year-old DUDE!\u2026 Oops! :-( Why don\u2019t you try \u201cMMMBop-ing\u201d someone your own age, ya freak! :-( Maybe THAT is why they hate the song so much! :-( But I\u2019m not bitter\u2026. I\u2019m not bitter at all\u2026 and even if I was, I can just play \u201cMMMBop\u201d and forget about all the \u201chaters\u201d! :-) All joking aside, whatever your reason for hating this song\u2026. Or, even if you loved the song back then, and just haven\u2019t heard it in a while\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s time to give \u201cMMMBop\u201c another chance! :-) ",
