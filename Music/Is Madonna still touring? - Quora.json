In fact she announced a slate of her Madame X tour dates on May 6th that will bring her to intimate venues across the country for a series of residency-like multi-night runs in theaters. The Live Nation-promoted tour will kick off on September 12th with the first of 7 nights at New York's 2,100-capacity BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. Here in Los Angeles she will be at The Wiltern with a 1,850-capacity in November with 11 shows there. Right now all shows in all cities are sold out. ",
