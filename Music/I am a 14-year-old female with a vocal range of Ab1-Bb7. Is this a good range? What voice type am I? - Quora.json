            "answer_text": "I do not intend to be rude, but there is almost no way that a 14 year old female could sing Ab1. Ab2 is still hard to believe. Ab3 is towards the lower range of an alto, and Ab2 is actually too low for most tenors as it lies at the very bottom of the baritone range. I am a trained male bass vocalist and have been singing for around 12 years. I have a wider range for a bass as I can hit up to around G4. The lowest note I can hit is C2, a major third higher than Ab1. So on the lower side, that is almost physically impossible. So much so that you would hold the world record for lowest note by a female which is currently held by Helen Leahey for hitting D2. Now on the higher side, Bb7 is extreme. So extreme that it\u2019s a minor third higher than the highest note sang by a celebrity (Mariah Carey\u2019s 2003 rendition of the Star Spangled Banner), which is a G7. Mariah Carey is actually a classically trained singer which attributes to her broad range. However, she does not hold the record for the highest note sung which is goes to Georgia Brown at G10. So while physically possible, at 14 Bb7 is too high unless possibly a whistle tone. I still doubt you would be able to hit such a note. So to answer your question, yes it is a good vocal range. It is way larger than any standard vocal range, though not the largest. However, it is physically impossible for a 14 year old female. I\u2019d say your true range is somewhere between E3-G5 and B3\u2013E6. Your vocal part is dependent on your tone quality in certain ranges more than it is your written range. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a huge range - enough so that there is no way to determine your voice category without actually hearing your voice. The determination would have to be made based on the tone quality. I suggest you find a voice teacher who can help you figure this out. The person needs to be open-minded, however. Their focus will need to be on helping you to sing correctly and safely throughout your range. This will mean they REALLY need to know what they are doing. I wish I could give you a better idea of how to figure that out. Maybe someone else on Quora can offer you advice on how to find someone who fits the bill. ",
