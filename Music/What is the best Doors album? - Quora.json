            "answer_text": "Tough question. Usually, when it comes to choosing a band\u2019s best or worst album, I can easily do so without hesitation, but The Doors, as always, are a bit different\u2026 The easy choice (the one the casual fan might make) would be to immediately point at \u201cThe one with the singles on it\u201d, i.e., their debut. And I wouldn\u2019t be able to find any solid argument against that choice because it is a magnificent album. But as I say, that\u2019s the easy choice; the one that requires no thought at all.And considering how much of the band\u2019s depth can be found in the so called\u201cdeep cuts\u201d on their albums; the songs that were never released as singles at all, but instead left to gather dust among their more illustrious brothers and sisters? It\u2019s on those tracks that The Doors were more free to express themselves and take risks. And it would be a great disservice to simply focus on the famous hits we\u2019ve all heard on the radio and in films, etc, while ignoring the many strange and wonderful gems hidden away and waiting to be discovered or rediscovered. I personally don\u2019t know which the best Doors album is. I have an idea. In fact, I have at least two or three ideas! But to make this as fair as possible, I will have to go through each and every Doors album and score each and every song before adding it all up and then draw conclusions and shit. Oh, I will NOT include \u201cOther Voices\u201d or \u201cFull Circle\u201d since they were released posthumously after Morrison\u2019s death and are not proper band albums, in my opinion.But I WILL include \u201cAn American Prayer\u201d because, hey, it does have Morrison on it. Let\u2019s break on through, shall we? The Doors  Break On Through (to the Other Side) - Great, classic rocker. Hard vocals. 5/5Soul Kitchen - Generic 60\u2019s keyboards and guitar, but the vocals save it. 4/5The Crystal Ship - Beautiful, mellow tune. Nice piano work as well. 4/5Twentieth Century Fox - Catchy little tune. Might\u2019ve made an OK single. 3,5/5Alabama Song (Whisky Bar) - OK. I prefer Bowie\u2019s demented version. 2,5/5Light My Fire - Famous riff. Great song The ultimate 60\u2019s psych jam. 5/5Back Door Man - Stomping blues number about anal sex. 3/5I Looked at You - Silly pop song. Has some nice playing on it. 3/5End of the Night - The \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d song. Nocturnal and weird. 4/5Take It as It Comes - Sounds like a mishmash of all the songs so far. 3/5The End - Out of nowhere, a monumental masterpiece for the ages. 5/5Song Score: 42/55 Percentage Score: 76% Lizard Skins: 4/5 Strange Days  Strange Days - Not so strange, except for the vocal effect. 3/5You\u2019re Lost Little Girl - A real hidden gem, this one. 4/5Love Me Two Times - Great song with furious harpsichord solo! 5/5Unhappy Girl - Remove the carnival sounds and this is pretty meh. 3/5Horse Latitudes - Morrison screams like a prophet over sound effects. 2/5Moonlight Drive - Just a blues, really. But has a nice guitar solo. 4/5People Are Strange - Classic anthem for the alienated and lonely. 5/5My Eyes Have Seen You - Would make a pretty good punk rock song. 3/5I Can\u2019t See Your Face in My Mind - Nothing special. Nice singing. 2/5When the Music\u2019s Over - \u201cThe End -part 2\u201d? Well, it wants to be\u2026 4/5Song Score: 35/50 Percentage Score: 70% Lizard Skins: 3,5/5 Waiting for the Sun  Hello, I Love You - Rips off the Kinks\u2019 \u201cAll Day and All of the Night\u201d. 3/5Love Street - Pretty abysmal love song. What the fuck? 2/5Not to Touch the Earth - Pumping rock song that goes nowhere. 3/5Summer\u2019s Almost Gone - So is the band\u2019s energy. Awful. 2/5Wintertime Love - Sadly, winter\u2019s even worse\u2026 2/5The Unknown Soldier - The band\u2019s worst single. Not terrible, though. 3/5Spanish Caravan - Bach-ish folk tune with nice pseudo-flamenco guitar. 4/5My Wild Love - Morrison sings a cappella with a choir of drunks. 2/5We Could Be So Good Together - If we could only write a good song. 2/5Yes, the River Knows - Easy listening at its worst. Embarrassing. 2/5Five to One - Great stomper. No one gets out alive, indeed. 4/5Song Score: 29/55 Percentage Score: 53% Lizard Skins: 2,5/5 The Soft Parade  Tell All the People - Beautiful soft pop. Could be a Carpenters track. 4/5Touch Me - Superb pop crooner with some tasty brass and jazz sax. 5/5Shaman\u2019s Blues - Cool title. Nice fuzz guitar. Not much of a song. 3/5Do It - This has a good guitar riff, but the song is too repetitive. 3/5Easy Ride - Someone\u2019s listened to Dylan\u2019s trio of electric albums\u2026 2/5Wild Child - Decent riff and slide guitar and\u2026\u2026nothing else. 2/5Runnin\u2019 Blue - This mixes every style of music known to man. 2/5Wishful Sinful - \u201cMumbling and String\u201d could\u2019ve been the title. 2/5The Soft Parade - The title track\u2019s supposed to be good, isn\u2019t it? 2/5Song Score: 25/45 Percentage Score: 56% Lizard Skins: 3/5 Morrison Hotel  Roadhouse Blues - Dirty bar blues. Released only as a B-side!!! 4/5Waiting for the Sun - Better than anything on its eponymous album. 4/5You Make Me Real - Even simple blues is great when it rocks this hard. 4/5Peace Frog - The Doors quite possibly invent funk. And it\u2019s good. 5/5Blue Sunday - Gorgeous ballad. One of Morrison\u2019s best performances. 5/5Ship of Fools - Swinging little rocker. Won\u2019t harm anyone. 3/5Land Ho! - The boys go crazy for some shore whores. Nice shuffle. 4/5The Spy - Witty blues. Nothing special but it sounds damn good. 4/5Queen of the Highway - Bit of a filler track. But nice playing. 3/5Indian Summer - Lounge version of \u201cThe End\u201d I guess. 3/5Maggie M\u2019Gill - Pretty hard-hitting blues jam. 3/5Song Score: 42/55 Percentage Score: 76% Lizard Skins: 4/5 L.A. Woman  The Changeling - Great, driving groove, but no melody to speak of. 3/5Love Her Madly - Average pop song. Nice tack piano, though. 3/5Been Down So Long - Pissed off and boring. Quite a feat! 2/5Car Hiss by My Window - The most boring blues you\u2019ll ever hear. 2/5L.A. Woman - Bittersweet love letter to the City of Angels. SUPERB. 5/5L\u2019America - Down to the psycho circus we march. OK, I guess. 3/5Hyacinth House - Beautiful and depressed. This is rather good. 4/5Crawling King Snake - Slow 12-bar blues. Ever so boring. 2/5The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) - Unusually complex. Nice. 4/5Riders on the Storm - The ultimate late-night, spooky driving song. 5/5Song Score: 31/50 Percentage Score: 62% Lizard Skins: 3/5 An American Prayer  Awake - Live recording of Morrison screaming \u201cWake up!\u201d. 1/5Ghost Song - Poetry spoken over a damn funky track. 4/5Dawn\u2019s Highway - Jim babbles about an accident he saw as a kid. 2/5Newborn Awakening - Basically \u201cPeace Frog\u201d with new lyrics. 3/5To Come of Age - Soldiers marching as Jim gets a hard-on, on a bus. 1/5Black Polished Chrome - Upbeat blues. More poetry. Good, but short. 3/5Latino Chrome - Jim reads poetry over a tasteful Latino backing. 3/5Angels and Sailors - More poetry mixed with Robert Johnson-type blues. 2/5Stoned Immaculate - The WASP revisited. We\u2019ve heard this before. 1/5The Movie - Jim reads poetry over backwards-playing bell sounds. 1/5Curses, Invocations - Yet more poetry. Over smooth jazz this time. 3/5American Night - Jim mumbles. A piano plays a chord. 1/5Roadhouse Blues - Great live version. Arguably superior. 4/5The World on Fire - Sounds of a rioting audience. More poetry. 1/5Lament - Jim wrote this about his\u2026\u2026cock. Yeah\u2026 2/5The Hitchhiker - Jim tells a boring story. \u201cRiders on the Storm\u201d plays. 1/5An American Prayer - \u201cGhost Song\u201d with a different poem. WTF? 2/5Hour for Magic - Poetry read over \u201cThe End\u201d. 1/5Freedom Exists - 20-second poem. Shit. 1/5A Feast of Friends - Another fucking poem. But the music is nice. 3/5Babylon Fading - More poetry over pretty good sound effects. 2/5Bird of Prey - A cappella song. Sampled by Fatboy Slim. Was a top 10 hit. 2/5The Ghost Song - The fucking \u201cGhost Song\u201d is repeated AGAIN! 2/5Song Score: 46/115 Percentage Score: 40% Lizard Skins: 2/5 RESULTOoooh, we have a tie! Both \u201cThe Doors\u201d and \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d have scored 4/5.Furthermore, they both have the same percentage score!That doesn\u2019t happen every day. Hmm\u2026what to do? How do we settle this? Well, their debut album has 3 top score songs whereas \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d only has 2. A bit of an anticlimactic finale, perhaps, but I\u2019m going to have to give the title ofBest Doors Album to their debut, \u201cThe Doors\u201d, simply because it has slightly more classic songs on it. But \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d is actually a stronger and more consistent album, in my opinion. The safe choice is the winner. The one that all the casual fans know. How boring. ",

            "answer_text": "In retrospect, it's easy to conclude the Doors were way ahead of their time, enjoying critical and popular acclaim years after the death of Jim Morrison and the cult following that continues to this day. The first eponymous album captures the group in essence, ranging from the scary-circus theme that drove 'Light My Fire\u2019 to the Oedipal bombastic climax, \u2018The End'. Critically and commercially, 'Strange Days' not only expanded the Doors' mystique, but improved on it with the singles 'People Are Strange\u2019 and 'Love Me Two Times\u2019, as well as another opus, 'When The Music's Over'. The subsequent albums continued the audial head trip, but by then the message (and Morrison's drug-induced equilibrium) began to stumble, despite occasional beams of brilliance. ",
