            "answer_text": "My recommendation has to be Napoleon Solo by At The Drive-In.   At The Drive-In - Napoleon Solo This song is so fucking awesome that I just had to learn the tab myself. For both guitars. Only slightly obsessive of me. Lyonel Perabo was actually the one who introduced me to the song in one of his answers. We talked a bit in the comments, and he encouraged me to try the rest of the album, which I've listened to dozens of times at this point. Thanks a ton again, Lyonel! If you enjoyed the song, check out the rest of In/Cansino/Out and if you're feeling the drive (slaps knee), Relationship of Command as well. A better album overall, I think, but nothing can beat this track. Both albums share the same acoustic-electric dynamic, though. The band actually broke up a couple years ago, (with the lead singer and guitarist forming The Mars Volta, another awesome band) but got back together for another tour going on through 2016. You can check out tickets here: At the Drive-In Be warned, though, they're selling out fast. The shows near me are already gonzo.  ",
