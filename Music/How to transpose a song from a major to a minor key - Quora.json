            "answer_text": "Using C major as an example you can shift gears to A minor which is the relative minor of C major. The chords of the C major scale are: || I Cmaj | II Dmin | III Emin | IV Fmaj | V G | VI Amin | VII B-7b5 | VIII C major || The A minor chord (and the E minor chord) have the same cadence function. That means the chords are interchangeable. Harmonic cadence is the format of chord motion. There are three cadences, the Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant cadences. The Tonic cadence is for stability and rest. Tonic chords are I Cmaj, IIIEmin, and VI Amin. The Subdominant cadence is used for motion. Subdominant chords should move into a stronger chord. Subdominant chords are II Dmin, IV Fmaj and, *VII B-7b5. The Dominant cadence is used for resolution. Dominant chords sound great when they move into Tonic chords. Dominant chords are V G and, *VII B-7b5. The *VII B-7b5 chord is a dual function chord. If it moves into a dominant chord, it acts as a subdominant chord. If it moves into a tonic chord, it acts as a dominant chord. When you want to put a minor key as your start point the 6th note of whatever major scale you are using is the tonic note for the minor aspect of the key. C to A minor. The good news is that chords of like cadence are interchangeable. The chords of the different cadences can be used to extend chord progressions while retaining their chord motion positions. You can use a four chord progression and expand it into four different progressions that have the same chord motion. This is a great way to create variations in the tune without too much repetition. This might sound complicated, but experiment with the cadences and get to know them. You might find some interesting possibilities. P.S. Look into some modal theory in your spare time Dig deep and enjoy! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You take the diatonic chords of the major key and you substitute the diatonic chords of the minor key. Major: I ii iii IV V vi viio Minor: i iio III iv v* VI VII (* v can be V). Decide what to do with the numbers on those chords (7, m7, sus4, etc). In some cases they\u2019ll transfer over well (likely with a modality change), in some cases not and you\u2019ll want to drop the number. Decide what to do with non-diatonic chords. Say you have a B-flat major chord in the key of C major. What to do with it in C minor? A chord a whole-step down from the tonic in major key is nondiatonic whereas in the minor key it\u2019s already diatonic. That may lose some of the flavor so you\u2019ll either have to accept that or find some other creative way to capture it (maybe make it Bbm). As for the melody, substitute the major mode scale degrees with the minor scale degrees. Essentially you\u2019ll flat scale degrees 3, 6, and 7\u2014except where you choose to keep the V in minor, you\u2019ll have to make sure you keep the major\u2019s leading tone where the 7th scale degree occurs over the V chord.
