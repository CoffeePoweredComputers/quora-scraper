            "answer_text": "Hey. You can easily avoid a copyright using the following 2 methods: Ask for the permission from the person/organization that owns the respective content. They might give you the permission to use their content in return of promotion (mentioning their link in your video/description), or they might be looking for some monetary benefit, depends on how you put forward your deal!The second and the most effective way is to change the pitch of the track before using it. Now, I know changing the pitch either makes the audio sound like it's been sung by a chipmunk (high pitch) or a demon (low pitch). To avoid that, get a professional DAW (Digital audio interface-the software used by professional audio engineers) for your system and change the pitch by a few cents. (1 semitone shift = 100 cents). It'll help your audio sound as close to the original and even save you from getting the copyright strike, without having to spend a single penny.A few softwares that have this feature are FL studio (windows), Ableton (Win+Mac), Logic Pro X (Mac). If you need more information on DAW/Softwares, feel free to contact me. Hope my answer helped you! ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot use someone else\u2019s content without permission. Doing so is illegal copyright infringement. YouTube enjoys protection from being sued for distributing illegal uploads, but that protection depends on them acting immediately if they are aware of illegal content. So you are definitely going to eventually get a copyright strike. ",
