I\u2019ll need to do more research but, I love the way when she enters a room, \u201cspeak now\u201d JetBlue stage for example, She doesn\u2019t simply walks onto a stage. She glides in nearly floats towards the stage. I also love the way she moves her hands as she sings from the wrists using her fingers to tune her emotional vocal notes. It may be her vocals, only\u2026 I\u2019d have to split he components vocal, music, motion to determine one or all three. All her songs are stories, therapy, or life experiences.
