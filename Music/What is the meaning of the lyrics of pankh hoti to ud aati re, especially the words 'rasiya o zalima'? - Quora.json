            "answer_text": "Rasiya means indulgent (in love and passion) and Zalim means torturer. It's an adjective for the male lover of a female who is expressing her desire to meet him but her object of desire (her lover) is indulgent yet torturous in the play of love. This false accusation is used in a flirtatious way. In world poetry, female emotions of love generally address their male lovers with such adjectives synonymous with being stoic, torturous, stubborn, insensitive. It's extremely common. Why? Generally we men do act a little unengaging with our female lovers. The \u201cfairer sex\u201d is little bit more emotional and expressive when compared to us and hence she does not understand his insensitive attitude towards love. Thus she addresses him to be stubborn and torturous. Second analogy could be derived from the Raas Leela of Krishna. He used to taunt, pester and in a harmless way torture the Gopis (maids of Gokul) with his Leela (ways to entice them with his charm and playfulness). So mughal description of Krishna\u2019s Leela calls him a zalim under Urdu influence of poetry. Again in a harmless way! E.g. My wife still calls me \u201ca boulder\u201d when it comes to love. Apparently I don't get her sensitivity. But nevertheless we do love each other.\u263a\ufe0f ",
