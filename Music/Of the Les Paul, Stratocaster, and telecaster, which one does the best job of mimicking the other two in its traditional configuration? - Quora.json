            "answer_text": "Ah, see the key words in the question, \u201ctraditional configuration.\u201d There\u2019s the rub. In their traditional configuration, in other words with the components that were part of the original design and without any modifications, none of these guitars is capable of mimicking the other two. The two Fenders are closer since they both employ single coil pickups but the strat does a better job of mimicking the tele than the other way around because the tele lacks the middle pickup and the two switch positions which blend the middle with the neck and the bridge pickups. But neither of them can mimic the sound of a Les Paul, since it\u2019s got humbucking pickups, and the traditional configuration of the Les Paul lacks the ability to split the coils of its pickups to have a single coil sound so it\u2019s not able to mimic either Fender. That\u2019s why back in the day, musicians would use all three in the studio, to have the broad range of sound that thankfully, we can achieve with just one guitar today due to modern improvements to the instruments.
