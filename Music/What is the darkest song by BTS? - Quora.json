If you\u2019re a full on ARMY then I encourage you to NOT read this. So the song is called \u201cPied Piper\u201d It encourages everyone to not study, and focus on just them. They\u2019re telling you that you\u2019ll be obsessed with them, they tell you to stop but you just can\u2019t. They\u2019ll take over you, even that just sounds plain wrong. You\u2019ll never escape from them like a Pied Piper. These are the Lyrics: [Verse 1: Jungkook] It\u2019s bad so it\u2019s betterYou know on the insideYou can\u2019t stop it now (you can\u2019t stop)So be honest with me [Verse 2: RM]StopNow stop watching and study for your testYour parents and boss hate meVideo clips, pictures, tweetsV app, Bon VoyageI know, you can\u2019t help what you likeBut stop, interpret the music video laterYou have so many pictures of me in your room anywayIt\u2019s not just one hour, it\u2019s a whole year that\u2019ll disappearSo this song is an award I\u2019m giving to you [Pre-Chorus: Jin, V]You\u2019re not being punishedCome here, I\u2019m your paradiseCan\u2019t close your eyesCan\u2019t close your eyesYou can throw a fit but it\u2019s no use(Don\u2019t reject me)Just close your eyes, tune your ears [Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this songIt\u2019s a bit dangerous but I\u2019m so sweetI\u2019m here to save you, I\u2019m here to ruin youYou called me, see?

            "answer_text": "Bts songs are not your ordinary songs. They are laden with hidden messages and dark thoughts. The backstory of the songs, the lyrics or what inspired them to write it is really mind boggling. Some songs that are impactful according to me are: Awake: This song by Jin, though melodious to hear, really wrecks my heart. Especially the line- 'Even so, i clutch six flowers in my hands'. The song talks about Jin's fears and struggles and the six flowers may refer to the others six members who are all younger to him. 2. First Love: Yoongi and the story of his Piano makes me cry than most love stories. And that's not all. It's based on his real life experience.  3. So far away: What can I say? This songs gives me shivers down my spine. Check it out for yourself.  Here is a link that's gives you more BTS songs which you have probably listened to numerous times but weren't aware of the meaning: 12 BTS songs with strong social messages ",
