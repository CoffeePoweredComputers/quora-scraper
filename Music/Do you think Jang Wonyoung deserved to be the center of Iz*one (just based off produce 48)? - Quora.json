            "answer_text": "When they first debuted, I\u2019d have said yes. I didn\u2019t like Wonyoung as a center, mainly because of why she was made center. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the votes were rigged because they didn\u2019t want a Japanese trainee to place first, and that the many votes Wonyoung gained were from perverts after her \u2018Side to Side\u2019 performance (it still makes me cringe. She was a minor and dancing an extremely sexual dance with the most revealing clothes) but I was still curious to see how she did as the center. Iz*one are an amazing group full of wonderful performers, and all of them outshined Wonyoung when the group first debuted. She\u2019s definitely improved over the years. Wonyoung has natural charisma and is beautiful and talented, but she lacks variety. I\u2019d prefer Sakura as the center since she suits and adapts to all of the concepts Iz*one have taken, but Wonyoung is doing an amazing job nonetheless. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely and personally I disagree with the arguments preferring Sakura to be the center instead of Wonyoung. As seen in PD101\u2019s previous projects, the center position was the one with the highest number of votes and has to be a good dancer and the one who draws the attention from the crowd when dancing. It doesn\u2019t really matter if the Center is a sub-vocalist, since both Kang Daniel and Somi were both subs. Wonyoung has this charisma that keep people\u2019s eyes fixed on her presence and everything from her stage presence, expressions and gestures are on point. Plus, her vocals even if it has a squeaky tone to it is much better than Sakura\u2019s. That\u2019s all I have to say based on my personal outlook on this matter. You are more than permitted to think the opposite of my thinking if it makes you feel liberated somehow. Bye2 ",

Based off what we could see off Produce 48 and the hard work that she put into the show, it was clear that she worked really hard and being center was definitely a good decision based off her work ethic. However, if being center meant being leader, Wonyoung would not fit that as well as Eunbi would. However, as the center\u2019s job is to look pretty, represent the group and to be the main spokesperson, I think Wonyoung does a good job and definitely fits the position. ",

Wonyoung\u2019s final ranking was 7 and they made it 1. Sakura\u2019s real ranking was one. It was fishy because Chaeyeon\u2019s final ranking was 12. Her final ranking was 3rd. Again they changed it. I think there were more Japanese members if they did not rig the votes. It isin\u2019t Jang Wonyoung\u2019s fault though. She isin\u2019t popular as Sakura and Chaeyeon. ",
