            "answer_text": "Going into this marketing with a great idea of how you will differentiate, and the right technology to do it with, is certainly a good idea. In fact, eCommerce & two-sided marketplaces are one of the most invested into private sector industries. This being said you really should prepare to make something that is awesome and unique. Your website/sales strategy should be different. For example look at Bonobos. While they do have stores, they just have people order the clothes online. Look at Birtchbox, offering subscription trial packs of makeup samples. Combine and explore the options for your product set. To do this you need the Epic Commerce system to make things flow in sync, while delivering a flawless, and effortless buying experience for customers. This system should be seamlessly integrated into any warehouse system you are using, while keeping order processing super simple. For the product set, try creating unique product, or making some exclusive partnerships with flagship private label brands which will attract a specific niche at first. Diving into the marketing side of things, you need to make sure your commerce system is continuously updating and converting customers more frequently. Using something like Epic Commerce you can automate the event based email series that gets sent out to customers for things like cart abandonment, social shares, purchases, new product etc. This will make it easy to for customers to keep coming back, once you have acquired them. On the investment side of things, your looking at about $3,000-$5,000 to get the site up and running with everything mentioned here, unless you happen to be technical, in which case you can get started for $29/month :-) and unlimited possibilities. For you inventory, depending on price point, you will want between 3 and 5 thousand minimum. Aside from this, have some money aside for marketing via social and local channels (be sure to keep tracking pixels in mind). For ROI (using hypothetical numbers), if you buy $5000 in inventory, you should be able to sell them for ~20\u201350% margin. However, your initial customer acquisition costs may approach $10-$15+ (again depending on customer segment). So, you sell an item for $100, buying it at wholesale for $70, making gross profit of $30 on each item sold but it costs you $15 to find someone who wants to purchase. Here\u2019s the math ($5000/70 = 71 items for sale, (71 * ($100\u201370\u201315)) = $1065 in net profit (without other considerations). So at this rate you put in $5000, you get $6065 back. What get\u2019s interesting is if you can consistently bring back customers, your $15 cost to acquire drops significantly, and your profit nearly doubles. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, selling clothing online is profitable, this is a business and it must be profitable. The problem is, how to make this business profitable. 1. Target and find your customers. When you trying to make money by selling something, you gotta find someone buys it from you. Find them, this is your first task, your business\u2019s cornerstone. 2. Promote your products. Now, try to let people know your products. Attracting their attention by showing your goods in front of them, you can do it in the traditional way like handing out leaflets. Or do it in modern ways like online marketing, facebook marketing . 3. Find a reliable supplier. Buy your products from a reliable supplier is a must. In business like clothing selling, you have to find a supplier that has thousands of SKUs in their stock and make sure they update the list frequently, because fashion trends change very frequently which makes it hard to fulfill your stock with latest fashion clothing if you only have a supplier that only have a small number of different style clothes. I recommend you Nihao Jewelry. 4. Manage your stock. As you may know, not all of your clothes are going to be sold, some of them may not be that popular and no customer is going to buy them from your store. This is the risk that you need to take and you shall find a way to avoid it happening. Keep your stock at a healthy level, most of your stock shall be the popular products that are eaty to be sold. As the rest of your stock, fulfill them with products that you shall test their sales in a specific period, this is called sale testament, use this method to predict the next hot selling one.     ",
