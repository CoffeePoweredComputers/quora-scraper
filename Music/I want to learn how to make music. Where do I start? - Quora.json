            "answer_text": "Just do it, go for it\u2026 Way back in 1990 after getting grounded (probably for some shit I didnt do) I found myself with nothing to do for 2 weeks, The previous year my brother had gifted me a ommodore Amiga 500 with a few games, a few PD scene disks and some cover disks, i had never shown any interest in the cover disks, there were a lot of strange programs with no instructions, the magazine from which they came now long gone, there was no internet or manuals to use so i just ignored them. back to being grounded, by now the game disks no longer worked, the only thing working was these cover disks, one of them had a program called protracker, it looked confusing, i had no idea what it did except play music, i poked around with it and worked out that it was for making music, aftter figuring it out i went about using the sounds it had to make what sounded to me like music based on the popular music of the time, i had zero musical background, i couldnt play an instrument, i kept at it and got better then 2 years later aged 16 i landed my first record deal all from the music I was making in my bedroom with a computer, i still couldnt play an instrument nor tell you anything about the music structure, chords, keys, tempos etc, ijust made it and made what sounded right\u2026 its now 2020, im no longer grounded, I have had numerous deal, worked with tons of artists, remixes, worked as a live pa/dj, released music for TV, film, radio and video games, commissioned music tracks and still releasing and remixing to this day\u2026.. I had zero musical background I just made what sounded like music and thats still my approach, music doesnt have to be perfect, for the producer it has to be fun and for the listener it has to be enjoyable\u2026 cant hit that balance with every song, just dont giv up\u2026. dont enter into it because you have aspiration of riches and fame because you will be disappointed, enter into it with the love of making music. In this day and age you probably wont usea tracker but theres a ton of DAWs out theere and tutorials on how they work but my suggestion is just go for it experience or not\u2026 good luck ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on what kind of music you wish to create and the kind of person you are or want to be when facing a new challenge like this. You should ask yourself what your goals are and what skills you\u2019ll require in order to achieve them as then you\u2019ll be able to ask better questions and find the correct responses to help you on your way. Saying that it can\u2019t hurt to learn a bit of piano and guitar\u2026 but we need to separate two skillsets for making music: Composing and songwriting. Composing is, for this chat (to stay simple), the art of instrumental based music without vocals or lyrics. Songwriting is of course mainly focused on packaging your vocals and lyrics by supporting them with music. Some people only want to be in an orchestra so they don\u2019t really need to be wasting much time on songwriting skills, others wish to play an instrument exclusively such as drums, bass, lead electric, etc etc Some wish to avoid songwriting and just play all the songs they like\u2026 some like electronic music and will find an acoustic guitar at least moderately incompatible for that goal. Once you\u2019ve determined roughly what you\u2019re hoping to achieve you can make appropriate decisions about approaching learning music. I wanted to test myself and felt compelled to see what happens without guidance (relying on my intuition, innovation, pattern recognition, instrument design and ears) so I accepted the cost that a lack of tuition or a structured learning would incur and just started trying out a bunch of stuff almost at random on an acoustic guitar. Then I started singing whatever I could make fit whilst playing whatever I could physically play to begin with until it became second nature to write and create rather than learn cover songs. So who do you admire, what do you aspire to do or what specific things are drawing you to learn music? I mean you can create music by beatboxing and singing or rapping, all you\u2019d need is practice and (if anything fm else at all) maybe a semi decent smartphone to create beats and try stuff. I quite like the new emerging music technology of things like Oddball, Orba, Jou\u00e9 Play, GripBeats, TheoryBoard, FreeDrum 2.0, and so on .. especially when combined with self teaching/learning systems such as Fret Zealot, ROLI LUMI keyboard + app (though ROLI\u2019s Blocks system and their Seaboard in general are next level but not really entry level imo), Synthesia app etc You can also get started with any number of great apps for music making though it is often a bit less like making music (from a musicians perspective) and more like playing with a toy that has many restrictions and limitations that are hard to live with when you play an instrument due to the handholding nature of simplifying music down to something anyone can do merely with an app and a phone. That\u2019s the cost of accessibility I suppose. I must admit despite 13 years of guitar and songwriting I\u2019m finding myself drawn to beat making and I\u2019ve been enjoying the stark change of pace Oddball and ROLI Lightpad Block has brought me to as I can create loops and layers just walking down the street holding my Lightpad or Oddball in one hand and my iPhone in the other. It\u2019s all transferable on some level tbh, much as the great rise of Guitar Hero style gaming actually helped those that went to a real guitar develop at the very least their sense of time.
