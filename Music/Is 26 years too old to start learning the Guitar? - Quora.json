            "answer_text": "No. I was asking myself the same question when I was 20. I know, big difference in age but hear me out. Most of my friends that play guitar had been playing since they were around 7, so I thought I was far too late. I decided to pursue it anyways and within a year I was leaps and bounds ahead of what I thought possible because I committed the time. Learning guitar isn't like learning a language where it becomes harder with age, the only factor that really matters is how much time you are willing to put in. If you dedicate 30 minutes or more per day, you will be well on your way to proficiency. There are so many free resources online to learn guitar that there is really  no excuse to not learn.  First thing I would do is learn the basic chords. After you do this, try learning some very simple songs online by watching YouTube tutorials. I personally used Marty Schwartz's videos at martyzsongs or JustinGuitar Songs. They have playlists specifically for beginners.  The joy that comes from progress will be enough to urge you to continue playing. That's what happened for me at least.  Best of luck and don't give up!   ",

            "answer_text": "I believe not.  I graduated college in my mid-thirties, used some of my initial paychecks to buy a Fender Strat and a Crate amp, took lessons, and played for a period of about 2 years.  However, a long commute, long hours at work and some other issues got in the way and I put the guitar down.  Fast forward 20+ years.  I bought my nephew's acoustic that was sitting abandoned in a closet to give him some needed cash.  Got inspired, took lessons, and got back into it.  Three years later, still playing/practicing.  I am not a very good guitar player,  but  happy one, and owner of eight guitars at last count (and I still have the Strat).   I don't believe it matters what age one starts at, unless perhaps you are considering a career as a musician.  I think it's more about commitment.  Had I stuck with playing the guitar those 20+ years, who knows how I would be describing my playing ability.   ",
