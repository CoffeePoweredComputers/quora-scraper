            "answer_text": "Back in his early days with the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan played with a center named Bill Cartright. Bill was a serviceable center defensively, but he wasn\u2019t a strong shooter. Even worse, though, was his free-throw shooting. He had a peculiarly non-standard free-throw shooting form, and it did not serve him well. I don\u2019t know if he was much about 50% at the line. I say all that to say this: everyone sings with some kind of technique. The reason we call \u201cgood technique\u201c \u201cgood\u201d is because it has proven to be good for the voice, either or both as a method of production and preservation of the voice. If your technique is bad, your singing may be better than that of some other people, but only because of the innate talent you might possess. Bad technique will not make your voice better. It may make your voice unique, it may even make you attractive in an eccentric kind of way, but it will not make you objectively better, and probably will deprive you of a long career in singing. So really it seems the best answer I can give you is, \u201cWhat do you mean by singing well?\u201c Because if by \u201dsinging well\u201d you mean \u201csinging in an attractive or entertaining way,\u201c then, yes, maybe. But train incorrectly and somehow, magically, know how to sing correctly after all that? I don\u2019t see that happening. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure! Ask just about any pop or rock star of the past sixty years. Some can sing extraordinarily well as young people but when they get older, their voices just go bad. Here\u2019s a stellar example of what I\u2019m talking about: Annie Haslam 1976 Renaissance - Carpet Of The Sun - 5/21/1976 - Capitol Theatre (Official)\" Annie Haslam 2019 Renaissance Live At The Union Chapel Now, aging can account for a lot of the loss of tonal quality in her extremes, to be sure, but you can practically hear her cords cracking under the stress of trying to more volume as she presses to hit her high notes again in 2019, notes that came beautifully to her in 1976. This is because she had bad technique but a beautiful voice, and once the voice lost its strength, she had nothing to fall back on. ",

            "answer_text": "This is rather a very deep question. It depends on how we interpret the term \u201cIncorrect Practice\u201d. If you mean that the lessons that you practice are incorrect, but the technique and breath support are correct then you will indeed sing better than many of the singers out there. If the lessons you practice are perfect, but your technique and support are incorrect, you can never sing well. It will lead to vocal damage and abuse in the long run. ",

There are many famous singers who have terrible technique, but are regarded as good singers by their fans. However, many, many of them end up with damage to their voices. I cannot imagine anyone who would like to practice incorrectly when their are so many advantages to learning the proper way. ",
