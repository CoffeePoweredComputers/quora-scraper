            "answer_text": "By almost all accounts I've read, Axl Rose is far from a mean person. Search the net and you'll find multiple firsthand accounts of people fortunate enough to hang out with him that describe him as low key, sensitive, introspective, hilarious, and extremely intelligent. Now I've also read that he has bipolar disorder that in his younger years was mostly untreated, and that his moods were very mercurial and sometimes unpredictable. Given that I've never met him, I obviously am not qualified to say anything one way or another, all of the above information was gleaned from multiple articles and first hand accounts from fans on message boards. At the end of the day, to front a massively huge, formerly extremely hedonistic band\u2026..I'd imagine you'd have to have a wild streak pretty long. The energy and drive that takes day in and day out is apparently massive. So take that for what you will, but in closing I don't believe he is a \u201dmean\u201d person by any stretch. ",
