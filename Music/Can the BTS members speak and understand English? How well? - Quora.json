            "answer_text": "Most BTS members can understand English because understanding is easier than speaking. Several can speak English on various levels of fluency. RM, BTS' leader, speaks and understands the most English. He is the one who mainly speaks during English based interviews or speeches. Jungkook, BTS' youngest member, in my opinion speaks and understands better than most other members and he's actively learning and getting better at it because he says he wants to communicate more with international ARMY. Yoongi, he understands most English as well. We, as fans, have long suspected that he's fluent in English especially after finding out recently that he attended a private English academy during his training. He's can be the shy type sometimes which is why he may not speak English more, being shy about his accent. I think its cute lol based on that, he could be above Jungkook as far as fluency and ability to understand, he simply just doesnt use his skills lol. Next I'd say is probably J Hope. He understands quite well also and can sometimes speak on his own in English but isnt quite as fluent as those above him. Jin is probably next. He also understands a bit and can sometimes respond in English but it does come out as broken English or similar words and phrases. Taehyung I think understands as well a bit but responding in English isnt usual for him during English based interviews which, other than RM and Jungkook, they rest usually do respond in Korean in English interviews with RM or a translator helping them. But Tae does learn English phrases and words and practices hard to say them even if its just special occasions like speaking to an English crowd at a concert. Jimin, he seems to also understand a bit, but his fluency seems to lack the most. I feel he is the member least likely to answer in English unless he practices specifically like he did for the Grammy interviews. Each member other than RM had a phrase or two practices ahead of time that they could use if they heard a certain question. Jimin and Taehyung practiced what seems to be the hardest. Jimin, while he likes to answer during US interviews, its always in Korean it seems with RM translating for him. ",

            "answer_text": "RM - He is the only member fluent in English. He is the official translator for BTS and translate questions for other members in interviews. He became fluent through the American show Friends, but I feel like there is more to it than that. Maybe an English class in school?Suga - Misconception with the silent member. He usually doesn't speak in interviews, but he can understand English pretty well. He just prefers to speak in Korean. He attended an English academy, so in terms of speaking and understanding its pretty well. He\u2019s just quiet.Jungkook - He works hard and studies a lot. He English has improved immensely and can say lots of phrases and sentences including, \u201cSome BTS members are from Hogwarts! \"He wants to help carry the burden for RM. Hardworking and noble! *tears*Jin - Jin practices his English in a couple of interviews and while he has some trouble he isn't afraid to practice it. I think it has improved immensely from his days of saying Roma instead of Roman.J - Hope - J-Hope has to know some English to produce and write songs for BTS. I don't think he utilizes it often though. He did Dionysus and that had a few words in English. He is great at speaking it and knows how to pick up words quickly. So I say has great at it. No more accent and influent reading.V - V can speak English decently, but in terms of other members, he has a more basic vocabulary and has a harder time picking words up. This is evident in videos and in VLive. I'm pretty sure no one will forget the time V said, \u201cI'm God.\u201d Instead of \u201cI'm good!\u201d It was a good laugh though. XDJimin - Jimin tries! He tries really hard! He just has trouble picking it up and is the most conscience around things. He can have conversations and pronounce things well, but its not as well as the others, but he tries! HE TRIES!-Jess the insomniac teen ",

            "answer_text": "Ya now they can speak and understand more than before. So let's see individually: Kim Namjoon aka RM the leader of BTS is really good in English. He is fluent but doesn't know meanings of some words which can be seen in some of the English interviews where he asks the meaning of that word. He has said that he taught himself English by watching FRIENDS in his school days. Kim Seokjin aka Jin can too understand and speak a bit. But, he's good enough to called himself Worldwide handsome in every other interview. Min Yoongi aka Suga too is good at English. He is said to be secretly fluent in English and you can find videos on YT as a proof that he actually is. He also raps in English in some of his self written songs, so ya I think he is good at English but tends to keep quiet during the interviews. That how he is. Jung Hoseok aka jhope ok I guess. \"I'm your hope, you're my hope, I'm jhope\" \" I hate snakeu\" \"\u2026and Sprite\" \"They made us what we are today, they gave us the wings to fly\" Park Jimin or simple jimin too is ok I'll say. But he has always remembered these words \"remember, we love you\" Kim Taehyung or V too I guess is ok? Jeon Jeongguk or Jungkook has been working hard to learn English these days. In a recent interview too all the members and he himself too agreed that he's the one who spends the most learning English. He also showed some words he learnt in his recent Vlive and uses some English sentences too. All in all, their English has improved a lot from before. You can see that RM doesn't need to translate everything to them now. They try their best to express in English while they're in a foreign country. These were what I think from what I've observed from their recent interviews and vlives. ",

            "answer_text": "All of the BTS members study English every single day and memorize about 10 words each day. There are members that can speak it better and understand it more than others. Here are the rankings for the members that understand and speak English the best. RM-this one is pretty obvious as RM self-taught himself English which is incredible, and he is better than a translater and doesnt have an accent! He sounds fully american! He is fluent.Suga-he is very good at english! He stated he can read English fluently, and he can actually speak it very well, you can here Suga mumble english in interviews, and speak it as well! Although we dont know how fluent suga is, by the way he speaks I would say he is close to fluent.Jin- Although people state that Jin is the second best at speaking english for BTS, he still struggles with his words at times. He sometimes struggles with the grammar part of english, but he can read English fluenty!J-Hope- J-hope is one of the songwriters for BTS so he has to know English because they do incorporate English in their songs. He is improving a ton the past few years and has been trying and studying very hard. He used to have a thick Korean accent but its slowly fading and hes doing great! He can also read fluently.V- V is able to talk with English speakers at fanmeeting and such despite his difficulties speaking it. He does not have a wide span of vocabulary but he can have conversations in English pretty well.Jungkook-Jungkook actually has a wider span of vocabulary for english than V, but he struggles speaking it and talking with people. Translating and doing cover songs in English has made him alot better, his accent is one of the best among the members.Jimin- Jimin seems the most self-conscience and uneasy speaking English, he is not comfortable with it. But his pronunciation has improved a ton! He can read English almost fluently, and can have conversations its just he struggles with the pronunciations and the order of his words.",

Every time joon says something about their english skills, he\u2019ll pull up and say a whole ass (random) english sentence and joon will just be bamboozled >-< Jin: I think he can understand quite an amount of english and speaking-wise, he can get by. During bon voyage, he talks, and even befriends, the foreigners. His english is good enough to help him get by and make some friends with really friendly and patient locals. Hobi, Jimin and Tae: I\u2019d say they\u2019re in the same level. I think they can speak and understand a decent amount of english. They learn really well and they usually memorize cute (long) sentences for armys <33 They know enough english to entertain and make people laugh <33 JK: Back then, I would\u2019ve put jk with hobi and the others. But recently, he\u2019s been studying really hard and well. I\u2019m so so proud of him! In his recent live, he says that in the interviews, he can actually understand that they were saying. Every time he answers, he also uses bigger/harder words! With joon being the most fluent one, I\u2019d put jk/yoongi as the second most fluent ones ",

            "answer_text": "The members have expressed how much they've been trying to learn and study English, but there's still a lot they don't know which requires them to still have a translator. Jimin has said that he doesn't know English very well at all and tends not to speak it a lot, and that he also doesn't understand some of the time. Jungkook, the youngest member, has stated numerous times that he studies hard and is now starting to understand things more and more, and the group has even said that he is the one who practices and studies English the most. And then of course we have RM who is fluent and understands pretty much anything that is said. As for the other members it's more difficult to tell, because Suga will randomly start speaking in English and seems to understand questions before they are translated. And J-Hope speaks English quite well and seems to know and understand a lot. For Jin he has said before that he wished he'd studied more and knew English at the time of debut, but that now he is beginning to learn and understand more. Finally V. We can see V speaking English a lot, but sometimes he tends to use the wrong words or mispronounces somethings and during English interviews he doesn't seem to understand until something is translated. So all members can speak a bit of English and some can understand most things. ",

So I saw them live without any editing without any monitors in the way etc. From what I understand, clearly Namjoon speaks very good English. Jin and Suga understand and speak English but are not confident enough to fully express what they want. Or maybe they were just tired and not in the mood to think lol. Jimin was def trying his best and spoke pretty well. As did Jungkook and JHope. Actually I was very impressed with Jungkooks vocabulary and Jhopes pronunciation. They\u2019re getting very good. Tae told us a story about asparagus lol. I believe he mentioned that he\u2019d prepared the speech (ie rehearsed it) prior so I\u2019m not too sure how well he is at formulating sentences. I am however pretty confident that all of them understand English well. They will nod along in interviews and they do have a relationship with a few English-speaking artists (like Halsey) so they have to have some level of comprehension. I think it just matters how confident they are in speaking. ",

He can also understand a little bit still needs a translator. Jimin is not too good in English. He does study it but it seems he\u2019s not too interested in the language. He has a pretty good English accent but his Korean accent pokes out a bit! V is not too good in English! He speaks when he needs to but his Korean accent makes it pretty hard to understand. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s adorable but he needs some work! Jungkook is\u2026 getting better? He\u2019s been studying English a lot lately. His English accent is pretty good, too. He\u2019s learning the English vocabulary pretty fast so I think he\u2019ll be almost up to RMs level really soon! ",

            "answer_text": "Kim Namjoon is fluent in English and is often the spokesperson for the group, having learnt it at a young age when watching \u2018Friends\u2019. I know that at least Hoseok, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook are learning the language though, as there are video\u2019s of them practicing. It\u2019s hugely believed that Yoongi took an English course at one stage and it\u2019s noticeable that he can understand the language, yet it\u2019s also clear that he struggles with sentence orderings and pronunciation. I\u2019d say that Jin is probably the least fluent and he gets nervous when speaking languages he isn\u2019t fluent in. At one point someone said he was the second most fluent in the group but I don\u2019t think so. He can say simple sentences and ask questions but they aren\u2019t complicated. I would argue that Hoseok, Taehyung and obviously Namjoon are the most fluent in the group, I didn\u2019t say Jungkook as he openly admits to finding English difficult. The reason I say Hoseok is quite fluent is because he is good with pronunciations and structuring sentences. I said Taehyung because he can follow the language quite well but he also knows how to answer questions short and to the point. ",

Being among 1% top scorer in the country during an important exam, he really did himself a good deed. He learned English from \u2018Friends\u2019. Making use the English and Korean subtitle as trial, then without them. A natural talent!  For the second-most talented English speaker in BTS, I cannot simply make a choice. The boys actually build their English extremely well.    Jungkook. V. Jimin. Suga. They are all on the same level. If you watched the videos of their ability in English, you\u2019ll understand why. They\u2019re able to talk a lot with variety of words. For J-Hope and Jin, they actually talk a lot in English but it\u2019s not the right one. J-Hope is mainly the member who always record videos for their English time. His passion should be praised.  Jin? Yes, his famous English line goes like \u2018Worldwide Handsome\u2019. Am I the one who ever thought that these two words are made by him? Jin likes to spell in English as well. The most memorable : P.I.Z.Z.A and P.A.S.T.A An amazing and handsome speller!  ",

Yoongi (Suga) can speak some English but feels very shy when doing so since he has a slight lisp, so he usually stays in the background during English interviews. Jungkook has a pretty great English-speaking voice, and it shows when he did a cover of Charlie Puth\u2019s \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk Anymore\u201d and Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201c2U\u201d in full English.

Rap Monster (leader) himself is self-taught in english, watching the tv show, \u2018friends\u2019. He usually helps the member with the american interviews as a translator and a main answerer. I think that V studied english when he was in school too. However, his english is not as good as RM. To appeal to the american fans, I still think that they have to learn some basic english to please them. So as a Korean, I would think their english speaking skills are actually quite good (Seeing as I cannot even speak korean myself, as much as i try). I definitely think that their english improved so much in the past year :) Hope this helps! :) ",

Don't challenge him though\u2026 This guy in spit fire in English too. Taehyung is learning still. He is better than before, but his way of speaking English is definitely enjoyable (\u201cI am god\u201d, \u201cNaat\u2026 Naat\u2026 NO!\u201d) Jimin is learning as well and he can say a few sentences fluently\u2026 (Lovely lovely lovely lovely). Jin too I would say has improved a lot\u2026 Though there are not many clips that show how much he has learned, but in the songs, you can hear him pronounce English parts really well. That's all.

He\u2019s pretty much fluent and he learned all that he knows by watching all the seasons of FRIENDS three times and he was just very dedicated. Once BTS was formed, none of the other members really knew english so he took it upon himself to push them to learn so that they can speak to the ARMYs that only speak english. So that was like in the beginning of BTS, now they can all speak and understand english very well, still not like Joonie but they can :) And I\u2019m honestly so proud of them for that because they\u2019ve always worked hard for anything they\u2019ve wanted/needed :\u2019) I hope this helped any questions/confusion :) ",

He raps really well in English too. Jungkook is the only member that I feel sings very well and fluently in English. The other members do too but I can actually fully understand what Jungkook is saying the best.

I can\u2019t confirm it and I\u2019m not about to go all over the internet looking for it. Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook can sort of speak English. They have their moments of \u201cEnglish time\u201d where they try their best to speak it, but it\u2019s not necessarily correct (especially grammar wise). I\u2019m pretty sure they can understand English pretty well. They have RM translating sometimes or when reading questions, one of the members reads it and translates it. Sometimes they ask for a translation. But overall, I think they can understand well enough to get around. ",
