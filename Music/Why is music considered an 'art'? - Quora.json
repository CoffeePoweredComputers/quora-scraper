            "answer_text": "Music, in my opinion is a mix of Science and Art. Let\u2019s just define both of them separately and then try to amalgamate. Science: Science is the concerted human effort to understand, or to understand better, the history of the natural world and how the natural world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding.Art: Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. This also includes other forms of art where creative thinking is involved.Music: Science? A single vibrating string can make a sound. But the many vibrating strings of instruments in an orchestra can make music. But is music simply a sound? A completely deaf person experiences music by feeling vibrations resonate throughout his/her body. So, what is music? Why it has such an affect on us? The National Science Foundation-funded documentary, The Music Instinct: Science and Song, which premiered in 2009, explores the answers to these questions. Experts in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, biology, physiology, physics and education worked alongside musicians to unravel the mysteries of music. The documentary spans from musicians explaining how melody and harmony are created, to musical intervals, to neuroscientists experimenting on how the brains of musicians interact when they play together. The research aims to understand everything about music: it's basic structure; it's biological, emotional and psychological effect on humans and the brain; it's healing and altering potential; and its function in the evolutionary process. By learning more about music, we can learn more about ourselves. Music helps scientists understand complex functions of the brain and opens up treatments for patients who are recovering from strokes or suffering with Parkinson's. Research even suggests that music may alter the structure of the brain. So this briefly explains why Music can be considered as a science. Music: Art? This is comparatively easier to explain because we have a tendency to put music in the art category naturally. Anything that is concerned with our creative side, we put that in the Art bucket. But why necessarily Art? Art is a representation of the times when it is made. Majorly, the inspiration has been the current scenarios, the inner turmoil of the people of that time. Music, similarly tends to capture the current scenario. In 1927, Saul Williams composed a brilliant song that was to become a must have in every jazz performer's repertoire. In 1929, Louis Armstrong recorded that song for the first time. Since then, \"Basin Street Blues\" has been adapted, recorded, re-recorded, re-mixed to suit every singer, taste and trend. We all know what \"the blues\" is. It's been quite a while since this name stopped to be associated with music only, but rather to a general state of mind present in all our lives at one point or another. This particular state of mind is universal. This way, we can certainly say that Music is just another art form, trying to showcase our mindsets in a more creative and engaging manner. Apart from this, a more general reason could be the creativity that is involved in creating music, say a song. Anything that revolves around creativity is comfortably called Art. So, in my opinion, Music is a beautiful mix of Science and Art. Art is what creates it and Science is what explains its plethoric effects on us. These questions are interesting, it\u2019s good to find reasons and ask ourselves, \u2018Why?\u2019 :) I was listening to \u2018The Chainsmokers ft. Phoebe Ryan : All We Know\u2019 all the while I was writing this, such a nice song. Music definitely has much more to it, than we can possibly define. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing is, when you see a painting, you admire like the concept of it, what the artist is tryng to say through that painting etc. The same goes to literature. Likewise music also comes under art, because, each and every artists convey something through their music. Each and every song has a concept, Love, Hate, Rage, Revolution, Heartbreaks, Emotions etc., artists actually tells us something in their songs like what happened in their life, how did they love, how should you react, how they reacted for things, what is happening around them, how are they dealing things and all! like how how a painting or literature is crafted very carefully, music needs a step more than theme, so yup! music can be considered as an art.. Hope this helps :) cHeErZ :) ",
