Double-entendre lyrics, plainly overt words about sex, politics, drugs, gangs, violence and the like, have always given the \u2018older\u2019 generation fits. If a parent has a problem with adult language about these topics - and yet chooses not to actively control what their child listens to - I\u2019d suggest asking your child \u2018what\u2019s that song about?\u2019 This will create an opportunity to discuss the subject matter of the song. Something to remember: you have an opinion of the song, that\u2019s all. Keep the conversation on that level: \u2018I don\u2019t really care for that song, because it\u2019s disrespectful of women, it trivializes sex, murder and violence is not entertaining to me, the coarse language is uncomfortable for me\u2019 - whatever your reasons are - \u2018if you choose to listen to this or sing this, please do so privately: use your earbuds, or take it to your room.\u2019 Once a person knows something, they can\u2019t un-know it; they can choose to ignore it, but must accept the responsibility.This way, your child has the option of creating a confrontation of disobeying you by playing/singing it in your presence, or listening to it alone, which not nearly as fun watching others\u2019 reactions when profanity or sexual lyrics are heard. Young people need to test their limits of what\u2019s possible, what they can \u2018get away with\u2019, and what the consequences are - that\u2019s how they grow, how they learn responsibility. It\u2019s important that parents are honest and consistent with rules and opinions, but understand that the era of total control over your children is long gone. TV, movies, the internet and their peers bombard them constantly with what\u2019s good, what\u2019s new, what\u2019s stupid, what \u2018everybody does\u2019, what \u2018everybody needs\u2019. Talking with them regularly about how we parents feel, and what impressions their actions project, and what consequences may await them, help them to make better choices - for themselves, not necessarily for the comfort of the parents.
