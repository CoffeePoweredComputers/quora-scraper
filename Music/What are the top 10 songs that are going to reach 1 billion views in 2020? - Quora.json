            "answer_text": "So, these are some of the songs that I think will hit 1 billion views in 2020: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello- Se\u00f1orita (865 m views)  This song is amazing. I am positive about it hitting a billion views this year. Billie Eilish- bad guy (707 m views)  I don't think people will get much tomboyish and edgy songs like these from a teenage girl. So, this song might too hit a billion views. BTS- DNA (898 m views)  ARMY!!!! Let's get it there!!! These are the only ones I have at the top of my mind right now. If you have any, please suggest in the comments below. Keep it mellow! ",
