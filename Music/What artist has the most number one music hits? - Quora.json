            "answer_text": "Well I have quite a few. Most of mine are around the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s and since I tend to prefer music that never even saw a popularity chart, I\u2019m sure their must be many people that have a lot more than I do. I would suggest it\u2019s probably one of the bigger and older radio stations that play only chart hits, assuming they keep the records in their libraries rather than just chuck them. I once heard that there are some people who have so many songs in their collection that they could never listen to them all in their lifetime. Personally I don\u2019t see the point, but someone like that might be a contender for having the most number one hit songs. OQ: Who has the most number one hit songs? ",
