            "answer_text": "Of course!There is no age limit that constricts one\u2019s ability to learn and master an instrument. Just pick up the right tutor or take up online video lessons on streaming sites like YouTube. The only thing you should remember is, the violin is one of the most challenging instrument s to learn and thus takes several months/years to play decent performance quality violin. I have been learning the violin since 2004, performing all along, and yet the spectrum of things to learn never ceases. Even after so long, I still do come across things I haven\u2019t learnt yet. All you need is persistence and patience, and remember EVERY violinist gets disappointing by his progress or the way his playing sounds during the initial first year at least, but eventually with tons of practice, you could be as good as anyone else. Keep yourself interested in what you do by picking up famous composers like Paganini, Strauss Bach, Schubert, Vivaldi, et cetera, and listen to their music, appreciate the elements, expressions and uniqueness in style of of each of these pieces. Nothing in the world can be learnt if you lack a lustrous interest in what you do. Pay attention to your basics; even holding the violin right and body posture matter in the long run. Scales and exercises/etuden may seem boring and unimportant, but trust me, they help you develop your skill. All the best and kudos for picking up the grandest of all instruments. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I started to play the violin at age 33. I am now almost 44. I can play grade 6 Suzuki level. I have played other instruments though. I started piano at age 5, and cello at age 14. I also have a degree in music. I think anyone can learn to play an instrument at any age. But you would not expect to become a profesionnal musician if you start later in life. 18 is a bit late but I have known a profesionnal violinist who started at age 22. She played violin in an orchestra. Learning an instrument takes a lot of practice. So you have to be willing to be patient and to work hard. Practicing mindfully several hours a day and studying with a good teacher are both keys to succes. ",

But, my keroncong teacher told me that he learnt to play violin at 23. He is that one guy whose UNIQUE violin sound. BUT, our play styles aren\u2019t made for those classical music pieces. If you aim to play classical music, I recommend you to enroll in music school. And don\u2019t let ages bother you. As long as you have passion for it, then go for it. I\u2019m trying to learn alto sax currently. I\u2019m 17. CHEER! ",

You also would want a teacher to help you work on rhythms, reading sheet music, holding and taking care of the instrument, bowings, and etc. Just like anything it takes time and practice. Once you understand how to play and know all of the notes and bowings you can anything (easy- at first). ",
