            "answer_text": "The Moodies had reformed after a 3 years layoff (most of them releasing solo albums) and anticipated a new album. Pinder had married and was living in California, refusing to travel to England. So the band all flew to his home, but a landslide ruined chances of recording. Plus, the band members were not on the same page, especially regarding future touring. Pinder had had enough at that point, although he had originally promised to tour. And then the final blow was Decca Records at a press conference stating Pinder was gone. So the band asked Patrick Moraz, a brilliant keyboardist who had played in Yes and Refugee to step in, and he did. Although the next album Long Distance Voyager did well, and had a hit single, many people missed Pinder, who had lent his symphonic background and talented arrangements to the group, as well as his songwriting.
