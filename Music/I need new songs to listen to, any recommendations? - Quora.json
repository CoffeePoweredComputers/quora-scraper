            "answer_text": " John Lennon - Love I listened to this song for the first time today, along with this whole album and was blown away. As I'm 15, I never grew up listening to The Beatles, Queen, Elvis, etc. However, I have been listening to older bands and artists, simply because there's some truly beautiful albums that were made before I was born and it's so annoying how people my age automatically dismiss something because it's old. Anyways, back to this song. First, the album cover sets the mood perfectly. Calm. I think that word describes the album, and this song best. This song has a simple, emotional instrumental buildup (piano? I think? I'm horrible at telling instruments apart, apologies) and it keeps the calm atmosphere throughout the whole song. Lennon starts signing about love, and what it is. It touches you emotionally. It's beautiful. Then, when his vocal finishes you get a small bit of piano again (if I'm correct on that) to finish the song off. It's over 3 minutes long but feels shorter than that, but for some reason I feel is at the perfect length. Lennon hits his artistic goal with the song, and doesn't milk it for what it's worth, but simply ends it before it's overdone. Short and sweet. Might I add a beautiful song again? Really, go listen to it. ",
