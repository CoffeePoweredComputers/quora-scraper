            "answer_text": "Yes, they can be recycled but may not be accepted in your local recycling stream.  You would need to contact the closest plastic recycling firm in your area.  Old CD cases are often referred to as polystyrene (PS) jewel cases and are made from the resin #6, PS. DVD cases are also generally recyclable since they are polypropylene (PP) or HIPP.  Some have a layer of LDPE which makes this more challenging but for certain lower grade products, this doens't matter. Keep in mind, recycling these items must be scalable.   For instance, if you are speaking generally about a product, say plastic utensils, they are recyclable if being generated at a manufacturing plant making millions of units on a daily basis, but when you're dealing with post consumer products, this becomes much more challenging as you're not likely able to consolidate the material in a cost effective manner.
