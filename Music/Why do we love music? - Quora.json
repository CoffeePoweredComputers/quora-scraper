            "answer_text": "We're attracted to music for the same reason we're attracted to fire: it's been a critical survival tool for us for hundreds of thousands of years.  image via Wikimedia commons Music cognition is one of the first high-level brain functions to emerge in infants, coming long before walking and talking. It's also one of the last to go in people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Music (and its twin sibling dance) are fundamental tools for soothing infants, for attracting mates, and for motivating and bonding groups ranging from kindergarten classes to infantry units. It enables us to both express our emotions and to actively modulate them, both within ourselves and among one another. Music is one of the very few known cultural universals. It's incredibly ancient -- there's good reason to believe that it precedes language in human evolutionary history. There's plausible speculation that it precedes bipedal walking as well. It's no great mystery why people like it.  The real mystery is why we in modern Western civilization developed the perverse idea that music is a frivolity. Steven Pinker, an otherwise very smart person who should know better, describes music as \"auditory cheesecake.\" Here in America, we mostly relegate music-making to highly skilled experts, while most of us participate in it passively or not at all. We shouldn't be surprised that depression, violence, drug abuse and suicide are epidemic in our country, even among our unprecedented levels of wealth, stability and safety. Lack of musical participation is both a cause and symptom of our unhappiness, and it demonstrates the failure of modern civilization to meet our emotional needs. In other human societies, probably in most of them throughout our deep history, music has always been a part of daily life, on a level with cooking or gossip. We would be wise to restore routine music-making to its proper place in the center of our lives. ",

            "answer_text": "So many reasons. So many people.  So many types of music.  So many ways to use music. Let's start with ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response.  This is the newer science of dissecting just what chord progressions, tones, voices, lyrics and sounds affect so many of us (not all).  Got into studying this when I couldn't understand why certain songs, classical and jazz pieces could give me goose bumps regularly or even made me cry. I wondered why a light wind blowing through my hair made me tingle. Upon delving deeper, I found that many of the musical pieces (Rachmaninoff on a Theme from Paganini, 18th variation, John Mayer's voice, Miles Davis' arrangement of 'Concierto de Arunjuez', Aaron Neville's 'Ave Maria', Sam Smith's 'Lay with Me', Adele's 'Hello', the Weeknd's 'Ima Care for You', Pachabel's Canon, Bach's 'Fugue in D',women's contralto voices, George Harrison's 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', the cello and oboe, etc., all reliably gave me goosebumps or even made me cry. Turns out I am not the only one.  There are many websites dedicated to the 10 pop songs that will make you cry or  the 10 classical pieces that will give you goosebumps.  Certain scenes in movies (which are designed to) make us cry, utilize certain chord progressions at a strategic point in the story. This may also be deemed AIE, or attention Induced Euphoria.  This 'euphoria' may be intentionally induced or stumbled upon.  What we know is that we want to have it again.  BTW not everyone weeps, feels chills or euphoria in response to common AIE specific stimuli. My guess is that people like and return to listen attentively, over and over to those pieces which elicit physiological pleasure.  For others, it's not the chills they seek, but the rush of dopamine and adrenaline that heavy metal subconsciously elicits.  Lovers of HM often want to go out and DO SOMETHING!!! Finally, the media (movies, TV, etc.) are well aware of which music elicits specific music and employs it to get a predicted response. ",
