            "answer_text": "It is just an umbrella term for all the American traditional folk music styles that most American popular music either descend or have an influence from. The genres in question would fall under blues, country, gospel, bluegrass, rhythm-and-blues, and rock-and-roll, but with an emphasis on acoustic instruments and arrangements. Therefore, if we are to look at the differences between the two genres, we will have to understand the origins of country music, how it forms a key part of traditional American folk music, and how it continues to influence, and be influenced by, with the newer musical styles and genres. \u201cRoots music\u201d, which is any traditional American music genre, such as old-time, jug band, Appalachian folk, zydeco, Cajun, spirituals, work songs, sea shanties, railroad songs, cowboy songs, Tejano, New Mexican folk, and Native American folk music, are usually included under this banner as well. Soon, electric instrumentation started to be widely employed by musicians rooted in these old traditions, most notably the electric guitar that became the staple within the entire blues music scene and started proliferating into the country music genre, starting in the 1930\u2019s. This was especially to be seen with the use of the Telecaster among country music guitarists and the emergence of Chicago, Detroit, Texas, and electric blues as blues musicians rooted in the Delta tradition made their way north and west for better work prospects and opportunities as part of the Great Migration of African-Americans during that time period. The most notable being Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, and Buddy Guy. Another important development is the folk and country musicians Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Carter Family reshaping songwriting and instrumentalists such as Chet Atkins reshaping guitar playing in country, folk, and eventually rock and roll. By the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s when these folk music forms began to merge with the American popular music of the day to form modern country(Nashville Sound), soul, blues rock, folk rock, rockabilly, and eventually roots and country rock, the definition of American folk music became altered to include these genres. The emergence of acts such as Gram Parsons, Neil Young, The Band, Van Morrison, Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, and Bonnie Raitt were emblematic of this new development. This neo-traditional sound solidified by the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s through alternative country, outlaw country, and Heartland rock acts such as John Mellencamp, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen, Steve Earle, Merle Haggard, Townes Van Zandt, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Drive-By Truckers, Lucinda Williams, and Waylon Jennings. At the same time, alternative acts such as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, and Calexico along with the jazz and R\u2019n\u2019B based Allen Toussaint and Dr John also exerted an influence as well. Nowadays, Americana is defined as a genre based on a blend of country, rock, and blues, that is closely tied with or shows a more direct influence of the traditional American folk music styles. This is especially true for the indie and alternative rock scene where the style enjoys the most popularity and influence among musicians and audiences alike. Additionally, many jazz musicians are either rooted in Americana or actively co-opt the genre due to the shared heritage in blues music with the most notable acts being Bela Fleck, Bill Frisell, Keith Jarrett, Brian Blade, Joni Mitchell, and Wynton Marsalis. Otherwise, it simply denotes a set of genres, music scenes, and styles that are directly tied with the traditional folk music of the United States regardless of level of mainstream popularity, ethnic origin, and choice of instrument, that most American music owes its roots and origins to. The style is not as fixed as it looks and are instead tied to one another through a shared history and heritage, which in turn would become firmly embedded into American popular and even classical music tradition. In other words, it can be best described as an aggregate of music genres with a shared tradition and common origin. TD;LR: Americana is an umbrella term for all the genres that are rooted in traditional American folk music styles, of which country music simply happens to form a part thereof. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a strange line; but I see country music as a much narrower form; it\u2019s a form of blues-derived American music in which certain vocal styles and mannerisms and certain lyrical themes prevail; there\u2019s often an underpinning of hopelessness, of the simple struggles and petty dramas of the working class. Americana is a much broader form of music: a music that is undeniably \u201cAmerican\u201din its structures, inflections, tones and feel \u2014 the kind of music that could come from nowhere else but (North) America. I say \u201cNorth America\u201d because I think that Canada has some fine examples of this kind of music, as well. This genre is informed by country and perhaps especially by the country rock of the Byrds and their offspring, but also is more likely to incorporate rhythm and blues, American folk, jazz, rock and roll stylings, even occasionally Velvet Underground-ish rock\u2026It is also generally less limited lyrically\u2026Not so depressing and defeated. It kind of sounds like country, but not always. Of course there is crossover: even as far back as the 70s rock and roll was creeping into country music and the line between country and rhythm and blues has never been all that sharp in my opinion. And some artists who are undeniably country, like Willie Nelson, occasionally make records that are better described as Americana, (if not flat out jazz.) Sometimes, due to the decades long dilution of country music, the line gets extremely blurry: the main difference may be more political than musical and the genres may be more distinguished by their audience than the music: Country being a favorite of rural, conservative right-wing white Americans; Americana being more preferred by the white educated middle class of the X or younger generations. In the end, I know it when I hear it, but I\u2019ll admit sometimes the line does get blurry. ",
