            "answer_text": "Chances are if you ask five people this question, you will get five different answers. The points of preference and contention are many: In general one will consider single coils vs. humbuckers (and how many of each), hardtail vs. vibrato, type of vibrato itself, 24.75\u2033 scale vs. 25.5\u2033 scale, rosewood vs. maple fretboard, one\u2019s personal playing style, personal preference of ergonomics/comfort, and a million other thoughts. And it doesn\u2019t matter if a guitar has a million features, pickup positions, or has an active EQ and onboard effects. The most complicated/comprehensive tone producing guitar to one person may be somewhat useless in someone else\u2019s hands. It\u2019s all how you use it, and if the features it has serve a needed purpose when you\u2019ve got all kinds of stuff to do. To be sure, some guitars have historically proven to be excellent all-arounders. I\u2019ve personally got four in mind as being the best all-around electric guitars out there. It\u2019s a very subjective bunch, and I suggest that you read my answer in light of anyone else\u2019s answer as well. If I needed to get a do-it-all, I\u2019d go plain stubborn with my compromised choice and probably get a Yamaha SA-2200, or an older spruce-top Yamana SA-2000 from 35+ years back or so if available, and maybe add a Bigsby B7 if I really need the wobbles (but would be fine otherwise). The AlNiCo V humbuckers they come with are fantastic all-around pickups with loads of dynamics on tap and excellent lower-volume response, and the split coil signal option creates some really usable Fender-like tones if needed, reminiscent of a 1968-spec Fender Japan Strat reissue I have with low-output pickups. This is the one guitar I\u2019d get if I had to make a choice to pick just one guitar and stick with it for a lifetime.  Speaking of which, very few things can beat the flexibility in timbre and practicality that an early 1960s-spec Fender Stratocaster of any flavor can produce, and with so many excellent Fender reissues as well as true-to-vintage builders out there that can do the early-production era sound, it\u2019s a no brainer: Glorious cleans, biting bridge crunch, a Mark Knoffler-esque mid position, quacky 2s and 4s, and a gloriously open and woody-sounding neck tone. Get decent Strat and be done with it, as you\u2019ll have more than half the history of rock, R&B, and pop at your fingertips\u2026that\u2019s an all-arounder for you. Get one with a humbucker in bridge position, and you\u2019ve got a real session beast. And here\u2019s my trusty 1959-spec Moollon S-Classic (early 2013).   To be sure, I\u2019m a daftly ham-fisted shoegazer at heart, which is why the incredibly balanced single coil tone of my 2001 Fender Jazzmaster (w/flatter vintage-spec bobbin pickups) is so hard to fault. The vibrato has just the right amount of tension and travel, shoulder balance and right forearm feel are perfect with the (larger) body size, and the separate neck pickup circuit is more useful than one might realize both for thumpy clean tones as well as for how it handles a vintage-spec Fuzz-Face or Big Muff. Telecaster players who need some \u201cfat\u201d and flexibility may find the Fender Jazzmaster curiously familiar and very functional for a wide variety of tones and styles, and I have no shame in admitting that I\u2019ve used the 3-tone sunburst CIJ Fender JM66 shown below on the majority of my recordings from the past 20 years. And for those that think it\u2019s a one-trick indie or surf-rock oddity, take some time to listen to the tones that Nels Cline gets out of his, and do give one a spin for yourself. A decent Jazzmaster really should not be overlooked as a very good all-arounder.  And as quirky as they are, sometimes Gretsch really gets some of them right. Among them, a number of limited \u2014 edition Duo Jets from the past decade have been absolutely stellar, and it\u2019s hard to describe the extent of what they can do, since they have a range of tones of their own. The Gretsch G6128T-DCM (the burgundy one shown below) is an amazing guitar. Super lightweight, incredible sustain from the pinned adjustomatic bridge, comfortably modern \u201csoft D\u201d neck profile, and so many tones from the HS Filtertrons when working in tandem with the tone knobs. It\u2019s like a comfortably lightweight, dynamic Les Paul Deluxe humbucking tone with a little bite of a Telecaster, and yet the fullness of an ES-335 with a little dialing in of the knobs. It\u2019s quite a wide range of tones I haven\u2019t heard on other guitars. Contemporary Gretsch Duo Jets (post 2003, since they come with the wonderfully clean and open AlNiCo HS Filtertrons) are proper sleepers with so many tones on tap.  All the best with your search and final choice(s). Above all, you should pick a guitar that can produce the tones that you need, as none of the above may even be right for you. ",

            "answer_text": "A question like this is a \u201ctrap\u201d that gets you thinking in, perhaps, the wrong direction. \u201cBest\u201d is a subjective superlative that cannot be established by group consensus. Each individual has their own, often idiosyncratic, if not quite biased view of what \u201cbest\u201d means with respect to a guitar\u2026much less trying to add \u201call-around\u201d to the equation. So, I\u2019ll put it to you like this. The \u201call-around\u201d part is mostly up to YOU, the player. YOU need to know what defines the sound, rhythm, and texture of a genre and match that with whatever gear you have at hand (or foot). You can, quite literally, play any genre on any electric guitar, provided you pay attention to the distinctives that define the genre. Remember, the amp, and, perhaps, to a lesser degree, outboard effects, may be as or even more important to the sound you are trying to achieve than the guitar. You can buy and play a full-on, ultra-high output active pickup guitar with a shredder-style fretboard to play some kind of Metal, but if you are running directly (no pedals) through a Fender twin with the gain set at \u20182\u2019 and the master volume at \u20185,\u2019 \u2026\u201dMetal\u201d ain\u2019t gonna happen! Likewise, you don\u2019t get smooth Jazz through a triple rectifier amp with the gain set at infinity and the master volume set to \u201cBleeding of Ears.\u201d I hope you don\u2019t miss my point. The \u201cbest\u201d \u201call-around\u201d guitar is generally the one you have in your hands that feels good to you, sounds the way you like it, that you actually enjoy playing, and that allows you to express yourself. It could be a single generic P90 pickup Les Paul Junior clone from Eiphone or a Chinese Squier Strat (Sub-$200 retail) or an actual vintage early 60s Fender Stratocaster or similar vintage Gibson Les Paul (in excess of $10,000). Any of those (put at the extremes on purpose) can play virtually any style you like\u2014if YOU know how to achieve the sound and can play the notes. So, find a guitar that makes you happy. (Like many of us, it might require more than one guitar to make us think we are happier, but we all could probably do 99%+ of what we do/play on one guitar.) Find a guitar in your budget. Play lots of guitars made by different makers. If one \u201cspeaks to you\u201d during this quest, get it, treat yourself to a professional set up, and then play the thing until you are worried you might wear it out. THAT\u2019S the best all-around guitar for you. ",
