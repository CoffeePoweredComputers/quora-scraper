            "answer_text": "Um no. BTS deserves it more to be honest. I\u2019m definitely ARMY, but I still think that based on statistics and I\u2019ll tell you why. BTS is getting lots of praise worldwide because it came from a small company and it\u2019s now a whole new Kpop sensation, and it\u2019s the most iconic and arguable the best and definitely the most famous Kpop group in the world. They also have a variety of music from a rock or punk style in their beginning albums to things like boy with luv and DNA now. They have won 200+ awards, and their choreography is amazing. Their lyrics are also very meaningful. I don\u2019t know Korean but I\u2019ve seen the lyrics and English, and they\u2019re not all centered around the same general love, breakup idea. They also have to do with self worth, flexing lol (in like Mic Drop and stuff) and other stuff like Go Go. They also have new stuff like black swan that are more chill but have a great tune and everything. Yes, they have love, but even their songs about love are more meaningful. They have accomplished way more, especially on Billboard with their best 100 artists and songs and everything. They actually worked for their fame and they deserve it. Also, they\u2019re known in every corner of the world, while many other Kpop groups are not. Now, onto BLACKPINK As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard before, blackpink came from one of the big three, so it didn\u2019t really have to work all that much for its popularity. Also, many people have literally learned about blackpink because they noticed BTS first. I\u2019m still in middle school, and I can tell you firsthand, you see BTS EVERYWHERE. People have BTS merch and stuff all the time. The same doesn\u2019t go for blackpink. Also, many people say blackpink\u2019s style is unique, and they\u2019re not wrong, it\u2019s definitely interesting and different from the Kpop norm, but their songs are so so similar. Not only are they always centralized around the same love breakup topics, their tunes and everything are so similar, and moreover they have like what 13 songs? BTS has waaaaayyyy more songs and some don\u2019t seem nearly as closely related as blackpink\u2019s do. Like if you listened to Danger or No More Dream, and then listened to something from one of their Love Yourself albums, you might not even realize they\u2019re from the same artist. Whereas blackpink over here, at first I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Kill This Love and DDU-DU-DDU-DU. And they made a big deal about how some songs like Kill This Love had hard choreography\u2026.no\u2026.just no\u2026.BTS\u2019 choreo is waaayyyy harder and they don\u2019t make a big deal out of it and you can tell it\u2019s harder they\u2019re like fainting and all after they do DNA and stuff. Also as for what you\u2019re saying about them having more views on YouTube, well obviously they will if they have 13 songs. Also, YouTube puts pauses on BTS MV\u2019s views. They don\u2019t do that for blackpink you can accidentally hit a BLACKPINK song and the view will count. And BTS was the first to reach the 1M, 10M and everything in 24 hours. They broke Taylor swift\u2019s record for fastest to get 1M with fake love. Also there is much more hype with BTS. Everyone is excited for Map of The Soul: 7, which is their new album. Problem is, BLACKPINK has like one album so a new album isn\u2019t that much of a thing\u2026.Also if you count all the listeners BTS has many more. And lets talk about their stage performances. Not gonna lie, blackpink sound like dying horses on stage. Like i know BTS doesn\u2019t have the strongest vocals out there, but they are hardly dependent on auto tune. They sound pretty good onstage. Like Jungkook\u2019s voice is flawless. My girl Jennie over here somehow managed to be a vocalist but she lipsyncs in award shows and everything. BTS sings in award shows and concerts with their hard choreo and all. So considering all the reasons above, blackpink doesn\u2019t have good reason to be get much more praise. Also the favoritism towards certain BLACKPINK members is completely unfair. Like what\u2019s so special about Jennie? Lisa\u2019s a better dancer than her, Jisoo and Rose have waaaayyy better vocals, and her rapping isn\u2019t anything special. Someone please get Suga over here for a sec. Jisoo is the one member who sounds somewhat like an alive human onstage, her vocals are actually good but she is so underrated. Jennies the only one with a solo and blackpink doesn\u2019t even write their own songs and BTS does, and still manages to make their lyrics better. This could honestly go on and on so I\u2019m just gonna stop now, hope this didn\u2019t sounds too biased I tried to not put too much personal opinion into it. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally love BLACKPINK, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a hard stan. Mostly because, while I love their personalities they\u2019re still pretty new and have hardly any songs out. They\u2019re still finding their identity, and sound. Those are the only reasons that have kept me from hardcore stanning BLACKPINK. Anyways, consistently BLACKPINK doesn\u2019t recieve more views than BTS. It appears that they do mostly because of the way YG markets their MV\u2019s (which if you ask me their marketing schemes are bs). Okay please no one get butthurt, this is just my opinion, let\u2019s proceed. Most of the views and recognition BLACKPINK is getting internationally sprouted from BTS. BTS has made their debut in America and has became a very big deal internationally as well, that\u2019s how most people got into the Kpop world and discovered BLACKPINK (ahem me). All those YouTube reactors you see, where do you think they started to stan BLACKPINK? From BTS. Bangtan started to promote a lot more in the USA and got big, people started to react to them and fans wanted more and told them about BLACKPINK, then the girls began to grow their popularity internationally. BLACKPINK became so popular internationally mostly because of their: visuals, vocals/rapping, fashion, and overall charismatic hip hop image. \u2014 Okay no more skipping around the bush, let me answer this question. I love BLACKPINK..but like honestly all the praise their getting just is too much, I just think they\u2019re a bit overrated. A lot of it isn\u2019t their fault, it\u2019s mostly YG who treats them like trash (yes that was shade YG). I mean these girls debuted in 2016\u2026it\u2019s literally 2018 and they have only 9 songs out and not even a full album. Sure YG promised a cb in the winter but he\u2019s known for his empty promises. Like just do your job right and manage them properly please and thank you, we\u2019re tired of this. Also can we talk about Ros\u00e9\u2019s voice? While I do hate the crap she gets for her voice being unstable or whatever, I do see where they\u2019re coming from. Like don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Ros\u00e9\u2019s vocals in the group, but COME ON. Have y\u2019all heard her original singing voice?? It\u2019s much healthier for her, much more stable, and overall has a unique and deeper tone to it. I seriously believe it could add so much depth to BLACKPINK. If only YG would stop teaching her unhealthy techniques that require her to damage her voice, I mean doesn\u2019t it remind you of the whole Britney Spears thing?? BLACKPINK have worked very hard, and they\u2019re extremely talented and do deserve all the praise and love. But some, let me repeat this because some of you will still come at me with \u201cnot all blinks are like that\u201d, SOME blinks don\u2019t really know their place. They compare BLACKPINK to Girls\u2019 Generation, or Twice, even BTS.. like was that a joke? BTS has gotten a lot more praise, they\u2019ve been around longer and have had to work twice as hard (as they are from a small company) to be where they are now. You can praise your favorites, but don\u2019t get ahead of yourself this early in the game. I\u2019m a BLINK, and the girls are very talented and have potential to be even bigger and are already off to an amazing start, but let\u2019s just take things a bit slower and let them experiment with their music more. So yeah that was my opinion, and I stand by it. Thanks for the request, hope this helped :) ",
