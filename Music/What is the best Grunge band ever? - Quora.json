            "answer_text": "Almost every grunge band had a sub-genre that informed their music... Nirvana = PunkPearl Jam = Classic RockSoundgarden = MetalSTP (if you count them) = PsychedelicAlice in Chains... Grunge. In this sense, Alice in Chains can be called the most quintessential grunge band because their sound is the most epitomal of the movement (so much so that what we would later call \"post-grunge\" bands nearly unanimously sound like them).  But it's hard to argue against Nirvana for best. Nirvana was really The Beatles of grunge, which is to say they unearthed the most simplistic and retroactively obvious melodies within their genre. And lyrically, they were the prototypical reflection of their era.  Pearl Jam's music is the most personal. While they have had more time than any other grunge band, and were still less influential than Nirvana or Alice in Chains, their music is more of a journey, more of a relationship. In this sense, I would consider Pearl Jam's music the most transportive and probably even the most transcendent. As an entire body of work, it's the most thorough, complete reflection of the experience of living. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy - the greatest \u2018Grunge\u2019 band would have to be Mudhoney.  They\u2019re the only major band from the early 90\u2019s Seattle \u2018grunge\u2019 era who actually accepted the label \u2018grunge\u2019 to describe their music (and to be honest it was probably more about trying to be ironic - that\u2019s the kind of band they are). Nirvana always rejected the grunge label - preferring to (more accurately) call themselves a hard rock band or a punk band. Pearl Jam never resembled the \u2018grunge\u2019 sound anyway - they were a hard rock band. Soundgarden were a straight forward heavy metal band Alice in Chains were also a heavy metal band The whole \u2018grunge\u2019 thing was more of a fashion statement and a media beat up than it was a genuine way to categorising the type of music coming out of Seattle in that era. So since Mudhoney were the only ones who accepted the label - I guess they are by default the greatest grunge band. ",
