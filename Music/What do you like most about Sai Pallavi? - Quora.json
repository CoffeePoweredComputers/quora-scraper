            "answer_text": "Sai Pallavi is one of the talented actresses in South Indian film industry. She has acted in many decent roles.  Sai Pallavi was acted as Tamil girl in Premam movie. Alphonse Putheran had crafted the character as Tamil girl as she belongs to Tamilnadu to show the differentiation in the characters. It may also the reason for Premam hit. During the film promotion and after the release, Sai Pallavi was started to referred to as Mallu girl by the media and she was not happy with this tag also.  She showed her displeasure in a Telugu entertainment magazine also. Sai Pallavi has revealed that she is a true Tamil girl hails from Coimbatore, Tamilnadu. She requested media to stop addressing her as Malli girl. This is the one I like her the most. We should always preserve our identity wherever we go.
