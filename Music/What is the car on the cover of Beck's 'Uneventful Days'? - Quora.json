            "answer_text": "I narrowed it down to a 1985\u201390 Honda CRX or Civic Si, but there are still some slight differences. The fuel door is on the passenger side, the headlights are different, the bonnet is different, it for some reason has Mercedes rims, but it\u2019s obviously not a Mercedes. Also, most of the 80s CRXs had thick black side skirts and a black bumper with two orange reflective thingys on the front bumper, something that the car on the cover doesn\u2019t have. Also, the logo on Beck\u2019s car isn\u2019t a Honda. ",
