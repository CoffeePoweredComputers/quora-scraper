            "answer_text": "A melody consists of a sequence of pitches in a certain rhythm. A melody can either repeat the same note or move up or down by interval. It can take as little as two notes to recognize a melody, especially if a distinctive interval is used at the beginning of the melody. For example, an ascending minor seventh is used at the beginning of the song \u201cSomewhere\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d An ascending augmented fourth is used at the beginning of two songs (also both from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d)\u2014\u201cMaria\u201d and \u201cCool.\u201d A descending major sixth would usually indicate the Willie Nelson country classic \u201cCrazy.\u201d A descending minor third could indicate \u201cHey Jude.\u201d Those first two notes of \u201cHey Jude\u201d are very distinctive, with or without the words. It seems to me that a strong melody should be recognized by the fourth or fifth note. Think \u201cGeorgia On My Mind,\u201d \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night,\u201d \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d or \u201cYesterday.\u201d The exception might be the case when a single note is repeated several times at the beginning of the song\u2014such as in \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\u201d or \u201cOne Note Samba.\u201d In that event, it may take more notes to recognize the melody.
