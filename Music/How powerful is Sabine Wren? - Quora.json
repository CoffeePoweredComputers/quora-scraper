            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Sabine Wren is a Mandalorian warrior from the cartoon series Star Wars Rebels. While she is not Force-sensitive, she is a skilled fighter and artist. Based on the TV series, we know that she is good with guns and explosives. She can also fly a jetpack. In Season 3, she learns how to wield the Darksaber, a Mandalorian lightsaber, under the tutelage of Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and Padawan Ezra Bridger. Sabine is good enough to defeat Gar Saxon, an older Mandalorian warrior in a duel. However, she chooses to spare his life. Saxon doesn\u2019t reciprocate and tries to kill her but is shot dead by Sabine\u2019s mother Ursa Wren. In short, Sabine is a skilled fighter who can handle firearms, explosives, and melee weapons. However, since she is not Force-sensitive, she would be in a different kettle of fish from the Jedi or Sith.  Credit: The Mary Sue and Lucasfilm ",
