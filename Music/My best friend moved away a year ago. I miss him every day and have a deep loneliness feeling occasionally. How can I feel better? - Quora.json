            "answer_text": "Sorry, but if you\u2019re still living in your parents\u2019 houses, you didn\u2019t have any choice in the decision to move. Even when I didn\u2019t want to and threw huge temper tantrums for several months, the move still happened. Now what you\u2019re doing is instead of looking forward, you\u2019re allowing your mind to romanticize how wonderful it would have been to keep your friend - imagining all sorts of wonderful scenarios whether or not they would have actually come about. It\u2019s time to stop. Contact your friend, and see if there\u2019s a way you can vacation together or spend time together. If not, and he\u2019s not contacting you over and over, then face the fact that he has found a new life, and you must do the same. Get out and explore places around you. Join clubs you haven\u2019t been to, or volunteer places, so you can see that as sad as you may now feel about your life, it could be so much worse. Eventually you will meet new people with whom you may have an even better friendship. ",

            "answer_text": "i feel very sorry for the distance between you and your best friend. In the meantime, I can only say that you should move on with your life\u2026 try to get involved in some selfless acts and try to help people in need\u2026in return you will receive the love from these people whom you helped. It may not be a substitute for your friend and closeness but it will help to move your mind away from your friend. the loneliness will not go away but it will be a bit less\u2026 I have lived in foreign countries for the past 7 years. it gets excruciatingly lonely. I don\u2019t have a gf or any other person to relate to\u2026 so what i do is talk to people when i get a chance. for e.g. in the grocery store, food counters, beleive me there is a lot hidden under people\u2019s stark exterior\u2026 trying to make a human connection with a lot of people makes me less miserable. \u2026having said that I must reiterate that I\u2019m still a loser ",
