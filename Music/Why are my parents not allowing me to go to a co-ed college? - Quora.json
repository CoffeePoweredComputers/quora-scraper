            "answer_text": "It seems from the wording of the question that you want to go to a co-ed school. I suspect if you could demonstrate that the co-ed school you want to go to has a superior academic program compared to the non-co-ed school your parents have in mind that you might be able to win them over. I expect this approach will be more successful than just saying you are super excited about mixing with the opposite sex during your puberty years at a co-ed school. ",
