            "answer_text": "The music industry is about 80\u201390% followers. Pre-internet, the music industry in the past was controlled by non musicians. If one artist started to make a ton of money, the industry would find other artists with the same sound to capitalize on that sales base because \u201cthat\u2019s what the kids were into\u201d. This would be repeated over and over again until a tipping point was reached. I\u2019m sure that still happens, but like many people I don\u2019t pay attention to mainstream music anymore now that I have so much choice. Sometimes the artist that is signed may not even fit that mold. The record company will reinvent the artist so they are a carbon copy of the hit artist, or at least similar. In some cases, the artists might all be working with the same production company, or may even have some of the same session musicians on their records. A good example of repackaging an artist with street cred to be a carbon copy is Meredeth Brooks, an accomplished guitarist and songwriter who had been around for almost 20 years when she broke into the mainstream. Instead of highlighting her guitar work, she was painstakingly marketed to sound exactly like Alanis Morristte in her single \u201cBitch\u201d. Many people to this day think Alanis performed and wrote the song.  To take this even further, there have been times when an artist does not even sing on their own record (in some of the more image based genres). There are some cases where the same ghost singer has sung on multiple records by different artists in the same genre (I\u2019m sworn to secrecy as to who). ",

            "answer_text": "Specific styles of voice become popular from time to time. This is true of the voices you speak of from the 80\u2019s. This is also true today of singers that sound a lot like Rihanna. Culture rides waves of the novel become familiar become obsolete. The other answer to this question is that your ear has been trained by experience to hear these singers as similar. If you familiarize yourself more with these singers you may find that they are in fact quite different in the way that they sing. Many people today might conclude that all opera singers have a very similar way of singing whereas a nineteenth century Italian man might beg to differ. The nineteenth century man might hear an eighteenth century opera vocal style as worlds apart from what he is used to. Likewise he might hear singing from the past few decades to be very similar sounding. ",
