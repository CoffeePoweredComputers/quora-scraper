He has strong producer support and fanbase and he has nothing really you can complain about him except maybe he let\u2019s others have their way too often but he\u2019s great in everything and people recognize that. So ye Heeseung. I don\u2019t need to be really detailed cause this is pretty much a no-brainer hahah. Btw if you don\u2019t know who he is, he was meant to be debut from TXT but he was removed from the line up for unknown reasons. I-Land is his second chance to debut. ",
