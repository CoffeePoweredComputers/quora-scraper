            "answer_text": "I personally think it\u2019s fine. However if you feel bad listening to it, so much so that it\u2019s affecting you, then there might be a problem. Do what\u2019s best for you. If it bothers you to listen to it, don\u2019t listen to it. I remember sometime last year I researched a bunch of different serial killers out of morbid fascination, and I discovered that Charles Manson had published a few albums. I remember listening to one of his songs (don\u2019t remember which one it was), and it sounded\u2026 beautiful. A part of me was in utter disbelief that somebody who was responsible for mass murder, had created such beautiful music. I almost felt guilty listening to it, because I kept thinking about the things he had done. But I\u2019ve learnt now that you can like certain little aspects of somebody and not like them as a whole. Just like how you could really love somebody, but there\u2019s always going to be at least one little thing about that person you don\u2019t like. Just because you like a murderer\u2019s music, doesn\u2019t mean you think all the horrible things they did were completely fine and justified. The art is seperate from the individual. You don\u2019t always have to be completely for or completely again someone, what they do, their artistic output, how they are as a person, etc. Honestly do what feels right for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember reading a Jehovah' s Witness pamphlet that suggested that because many of the great composers lived dissolute lives their music was corrupting. This, of course, is complete nonsense. Music is sound and sound isn' t inherently good or evil except by association. That is to say, we can call music \u201cevil\u201d only by virtue of an association with evil made through some other medium such as words or visual depiction. Take Wagner. He was an objectionable person and anti-semite (\u201crid music of the Jews\", he said). Hitler later jumped upon his anti-semitism and used Wagner' s music as part of his propaganda machine. To this day, through the power of association, many Jews cannot listen to Wagner. Yet one famous Jewish musician does perform him, and in Israel. He is the pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Why? Because he knows that music is music! ",
