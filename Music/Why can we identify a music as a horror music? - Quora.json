            "answer_text": "Because we've heard the same tropes in music for horror movies over and over again--namely augmented sevenths and minor keys being used over and over again. Minor keys are also used in \"sad' films too, but if you hear an augmented seventh you know right away it's  a horror film. Those chords are only used for \"jump\" horror scenes. You never hear them in any other context. They sound like shrieking or screaming. Another common motif that is used in music in horror films is \"breathing\" music, where you hear someone breathing instead of singing. This gives a creepy feel to the film. It was made famous in Friday The 13th. ",

            "answer_text": "One can identify horror music because most of them are based on augmented and diminished chord patterns that bring in a sense of dissonance within the resonant chord. The dissonance brings in unrest to the listener's mind thereby feeding into her anxiety. Apart from the chord pattern, horror music is known to use unnatural low frequencies and ambient night sounds. With the advent of technology, a lot of natural sounds like laughs, furniture creeks etc are looped through various effects that bring in harmonics, delay, reverb or combined effects to create an ambiance that's outright dissonant.
