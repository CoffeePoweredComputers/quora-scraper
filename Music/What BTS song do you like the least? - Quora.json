            "answer_text": "Dionysus Now I know a lot of people LOVE this song. But you see, my personality is really chill and laid back. I\u2019m not the OH YEAH LET\u2019S PARTY kind of person. When I first listened to Dionysus, I was like, wth? When I found out so many people LOVED it, I decided to give it another try, but I just couldn\u2019t finish it. I don\u2019t particularly like fast-paced songs or songs with jazzy feels or trumpets and that stuff. Singularity I\u2019m sorry, the lyrics are, no doubt, amazing. But Tae\u2019s voice (I\u2019m sorry bae) is too deep for my liking. It has a very \u2018Jazz\u2019 feeling to it, which I don\u2019t like. Fake Love (at first listen) Y\u2019all \u2019bout to be real mad at me. BUT. I really thought the song had one of the best structures ever: Starting with an unexpected DEEP VOICEImmediately going into the chorus (which isn\u2019t really popular, most songs have a pre-chorus)Breaking it down with RM\u2019s rapFake Love is structured in a way that keeps your heart going up and down. It\u2019s like riding a wave. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be-like a play with emotions. However, I really didn\u2019t like it when they went \u2018Love you so bad, love you so bad\u2019. I really disliked that part. No offense, but to me it kinda sounded like they ran out of ideas and decided to put that part in so that the song was longer. But when it continues to the part \u2018Mould a lie\u2026\u2019 THOSE lyrics I understand. But the whole part was a no no (in terms of melody and the lyrics) for me. But this is the song where we got RM\u2019s \u2018IDK, Nan Molla\u2019Jin\u2019s beautiful actingSuga\u2019s hairJhope\u2019s mirror thing with JKJimin\u2019s blue contactsTaehyung\u2019s deep voiceJungkook\u2019s AbsDope and Fire (for the same reasons) The only parts I didn\u2019t like in this song was Jhope\u2019s parts. In Fire, I didn\u2019t like Jhope\u2019s \u2018Room Room\u2019 and \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 in the first verse. In Dope, I didn\u2019t like it when he made his voice go all teeny-tiny. I saw someone say one time that, \u201cWhen you\u2019re happy, you connect with the music; when you\u2019re sad, you understand the lyrics\u201d. I\u2019m happy most of the time (Lmao I hope so) so, yeah, I tend to focus on the melody than the lyrics. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say I hate them but I just get tired of listening to it or it doesn\u2019t appeal to me. i got into bts for their music and my playlist was all their album which wasn\u2019t very much because they were quite small at the time. Today, as they have released so many music, I can now make several judgments about which songs I don\u2019t prefer or would skip over. Fake Love: this song is just so\u2026 repetitive? I hard a hard time listening to it especially the chorus. However, when I experienced this song at their last concert with fan chants is it was enjoyable chanting the fake love part! However, I can not listen to this song as much as the others.Run- also very repetitive, but again what songs are not repetitive these days? Lmao. I feel like RUN first stuck out to me, but I just lost interest in it. And the dance wasn\u2019t my favorite!IDOL- the music video was cool, however, it sounded like something I heard before. But this songs gets lit in the concerts! And when you\u2019re slowly getting into the song, I just can\u2019t for some reason, listen to it voluntarily.DNA- IDK WHY I JUST DONT LIKE IT LOL. It\u2019s not catchy to me, and The way they chose to arrange or sing of the lyrics was weird and the chorus was not as strong?Boy With Luv- I\u2019m so sad bc I was quite disappointed when this came out. It just didn\u2019t feel like them, and I thought it was due to them debuting in America, so yes I was expecting some change in their style! However, not to my liking. It\u2019s that song where you\u2019ll catch yourself humming to but you would tell others you don\u2019t like the song. IT WAS THAT SONG. I still freak out when it comes on the radio but as I\u2019m singing to it, i wish it would\u2019ve been a different song that could\u2019ve been on the radio instead.sorry for the crappy explanations, these 5 songs are just not my cup of tea! And everyone has those. I do love the majority of their songs. I also realize these are the ones that are promoted the most so therefore it makes sense if I get tired of listening to them because I always HEAR THEM lol!!! I also realize that these songs are more recent which explains why I prefer their old music so much haha. I still listen to their old albums till this day! ",
