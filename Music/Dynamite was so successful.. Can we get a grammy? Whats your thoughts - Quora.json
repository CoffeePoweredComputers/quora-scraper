            "answer_text": "I think it is both yes and no. Let me explain. Despite their massive commercial success, they have yet to be nominated for a Grammy because of the rules of nomination for the Best New Artist, but thank to the change in the rules of nomination, by Grammy, they have allowed BTS to be nominated for Best New Artist, even despite having more than 30 songs in their discography, and with their first English song Dynamite, which has broke records on Youtube and Billboard, and have also reached the #1 spots on Billboard Hot 100 chart, and in other musical hits as well. They have been nominated for two categories in Grammys for their song Dynamite, and they continue to promote their song, to encourage ARMY to find happiness despite these circumstances and to look on the bright side of things, as well as spread positivity to everyone round the world, so, we can overcome this situation, as quickly as possible. Their message and intent has drawn people in all over the world and as given them a solid footing on radio play in America which has been an area that they haven\u2019t conquered until now. So, chances of winning Grammy although may seem far fetched, considering all other factors the we would have to consider for them to win, would be groundbreaking moment, if they were to win a Grammy Award and would be a historic moment in history for Kpop. However, it can be difficult for them to achieve such an award, because last year, they weren't nominated for the Grammy Awards even with the success of Lights and Boy with Luv, and although Dynamite has gained so much success, and broke records that no one could have imagined, it is har against other nominees as well, and while ARMYs are devoted and dedicated to their members, other fandoms are just as loyal and supportive of them and would supply the support they need to be able to win. So there are many worrying sides to this, and although it is something we don't want it admit, I think their culture may have a playing factor in the decision making process. It is not easy for foreigners to win an award, in a event that mainly has only celebrated American artists, so for a Asian group to win an award, it might be something that can bitt negative and positive, because while many people will embrace the change in the industry, for the acceptance of the foreign artists, others may not be accepting of it, and BTS might receive criticism, for the award that they have coined, and be deemed undeserving of it. I think as much as we want change, it's hard for some to see that forget artists can just be as equally talented and make an impact across the world as American artists. But until then it is will be a long way before the change will begin. But, we don\u2019t know what will happen in 2021, so we just have to hope that BTS will get an award and see. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the rulebook, there isn\u2019t a reason why Dynamite couldn\u2019t get a Grammy. There are also a couple other categories they could be eligible for: Best Pop Duo/Group performance, Record of The Year, or Album of the Year, or even Best New Artist due to the breakthrough they had topping the Billboard charts (though I think this would discredit how much they\u2019ve done before this). However, as much as I want it to be, it\u2019s not super likely. The Grammys are lagging behind in terms of diversity, they always have been. I really hope they prove me wrong though, I\u2019d love it so much if I could see the boys get a Grammy!! ",
