            "answer_text": "You shouldn\u2019t \u201ctrade in\u201d a guitar while you\u2019re buying another instrument. You should make the best deal you can to buy the one you want. A typical music store will accept used instruments to resell either on consignment, or they may offer to buy an instrument outright. \u201cTrading in\u201d your old guitar while buying a new one is the same as the store buying it outright. When they do this, they are taking the risk and spending cash (or effectively spending cash by taking the amount off the price they are getting for your new instrument) while they have to keep the trade-in in stock and wait till someone wants it, and hope it will sell at the price they paid for it. So they typically will pay you about 50% of what they hope they can sell it for later. Some stores do a lot of consignment sales, some very few. When I buy an instrument that replaces one I already own, I usually put my old instrument for sale on consignment. I\u2019ll wait a few months to get paid, but I\u2019ll get paid more, and I will know exactly how much each transaction was worth. Typical consignment rates charged by stores are 15\u201330%. Some stores charge up to 50%\u2014the reason is that they don\u2019t really want to do consignment sales, because they would rather sell stock that they own. This makes business sense to them, fine, so take your consignment elsewhere. Of course you can sell your instruments directly online via Craigslist/Kijiji (Canada)/ eBay / Reverb etc. I don\u2019t like the hassle myself, and I live in a rather remote location, so I stick with the stores that have treated me well with consignment deals.

            "answer_text": "Guitar Center has trolls at headquarters that have the heads of staff that are too generous. So, generally, if you take your guitar there, you can expect to get 50\u201360% of the retail value in trade, or 40\u201350% as a cash sale. They\u2019ll likely nickel and dime you for every scratch so plan on the lower numbers. Of course, if it\u2019s fugazi or doesn\u2019t work properly, they might not notice and give you MORE than it\u2019s worth\u2026 A private shop like Dave\u2019s Guitar Shop in Lacrosse, WI (no affiliation except he\u2019s a friend and I\u2019ve bought dozens of guitars from him) will generally give you 80% of retail on a consignment, 70\u201375% on a trade and 60% on a sale. He\u2019ll be honest with you about what your guitar is worth. As to the question of \u201cmaking money\u201d on buying/selling a guitar. It CAN be done, but you\u2019ve got to know your stuff and be somewhat lucky. I\u2019d guess I lose a bit on 1/3, break even on 1/3 and make some money on 1/3. I\u2019ve been doing this 30 years, so I know my stuff as well as most amateurs. It\u2019s a hobby that\u2019s more or less paid for itself over the years, but that takes discipline and often owning a guitar for years before it\u2019s finally worth more than you paid (OK if you love it anyway).

They gave me, on average, about 40% less than I could have got if I hadn\u2019t needed money quickly\u2026. I have also bought guitars \u201con swapsies\u201d that I got to keep\u2026 Listen up, child, for this is a bitter lesson, but one you must learn\u2026 you will never buy a guitar for less than it\u2019s worth or sell one for anything near what it\u2019s worth to you. Every pawnshop in America is a testament to broken hearts and dreams. They have to feed their children just like you have to feed yours. Did you think it would happen by magic???
