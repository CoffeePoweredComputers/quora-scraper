            "answer_text": "If you asked a native Korean that, they would probably tell you that it's more \"pretty\" than \"girly.\" The concept of \"prettiness\" exists for both males and females in Korean culture. Unlike the US or just other western cultures, calling a guy \"pretty\" doesn't automatically make him \"gay\" or \"feminine\"; they are merely beautiful or, in other words, fair. Of course, masculine and more manly looking males do exist as a type of ideal male \"look,\" and they would be deemed more as \"good-looking\" or \"cool\" (having \uba4b), but the \"flower boy\" is loved by females all around as a nice, sweet almost \"younger brother\" type. EXAMPLE OF A FLOWER BOY  A MORE MASCULINE LOOK (ALSO STRONGLY \"KOREAN\" FACE)  Korean culture adores, almost to the point of worship, beautiful appearances and aesthetics. The Korean language, in a different sense, is supposed to be made as beautiful and balanced as possible by using something called \"vowel harmony\" to match vowels so that they do not oppose each other, like coordinating an outfit. The hanbok, traditional Korean clothes, has flowing cloth and gentle curves in the sleeves and gracefully curved shoes.  I quote my own mother on this: at one point she commented on my favorite boy group, B1A4, saying that Sandeul (who makes derp faces often) must, work on his \ud45c\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac (or \"expression control\") like the maknae, Gongchan, who smiles prettily and always wears a pleasant expression. According to this, Korean culture emphasises a lot on taking care of your appearance, male or female. If you don't look your best, you haven't tried hard enough. SANDEUL DERP  \u314eGONGCHAN CAN CONTROL HIS EXPRESSIONS  Historically, being strong and masculine may have been more attractive to peasants, as it indicated a man was productive and would provide well. But muscle and roughness was certainly not ideal among higher-class people; a higher class man was expected to be studying or writing beautiful poetry, not working out at the gym. The modern (after militaristic) Korea takes most of its standards from upper class society, as it was more sophisticated and \"better\" in general. Okay, that was a long detour, but let's get to the actual question.  In \"K-pop\" (talking about boy and girl groups, not ballad singers or anything else), everything has to be attractive. I'm sure every fan gets that, right? Girls are supposed to be goddesses, and guys are supposed to be swoon-causing Adonises. The bad-boy is still \"in,\" but a soft-hearted and pretty bad-boy is much preferred to a profanely cussing, rude, and barbaric one.  There's also a term called \"\ub9cc\ucc22\ub3cc\" or \"idols who look like they were ripped out of a manhwa\"; there're plenty of flower boys in manhwa, even more than beautiful girls. FLOWER BAD BOY  Actors, on the other hand, especially the older ones (in their 30's or 40's), do not lean as extremely to the beautiful male ideal. Actors are often-times more masculine than the idols who populate K-pop nowadays. I think of Shinhwa as having a more \"actor style\" look. However, younger actors may be similar to the \"idol look.\"  OLDER ACTOR LOOK  FLOWER ACTOR (WELL, LEE JUN KI, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN)  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cFlower boy concept\" Kpop fans, mostly young fans( 10 to 15 year old) prefer soft and sweet looking men over rough looking men. Haven't you seen the whitewashed photos of idols with eye catching captions like \u201che looks ethereal \u201c he looks like an anime \u201ceverything about him is so perfect *sighs*\u201d, I mean these captions can explain well the reason for the preference of soft looking male idols. In reality korean men look manly like all other country men but young fans expect their idols to look different from normal people, they always want their Idols to look soft, delicate and innocent like a webtoon or anime character because of these general predilections agencies impose the idols to maintain their physical image.They always have to shave their beard, dye their hair in facy colours and style their hair in different styles like full bangs, swept bangs and wispy bangs to maintain their idol look also they do makeups and wear colour contacts during their stage perfemonces to look more unreal and attractive. Almost in all countries beard is considered as the physical manifestation of \u201cmale significance\u201d, facial hair makes a man look more Manly but, in korea generally facial hair is considered as an undesirable trait because of this male idols are forced to shave their facial hair everyday to look perfect everytime (since the camera follows them 24\u00d77)  Most of the idols seem to be stuck in these beauty standards and if they fail to live up to these beauty standards some immature fans will start bashing them Whenever they see an unedited photo of an idol with no makeup, fancy colour and lightings they reacting like this \ud83d\udc47   Visuals of an idol has a prominent role in their fame.. this is the anatomy of a perfect kpop male idol\ud83d\udc47  For instance This is Kris wu a former member of Exo.. he looks like a perfect kpop idol in this photo  and this is how he looks without stage makeup  Kpop idols look more manly without stage makeups and outfits also they have beard and moustache like other men     ",
