            "answer_text": "They are only dangerous if you think looking like a complete and total idiot is dangerous. Otherwise, they are just noise\u2026nothing more, nothing less. The whole concept of binaural beats is a pseudoscience, that leads to people who desperately want something to be true to cling to them. Whether it be someone who is self conscious about their IQ, or someone who saw the movie Limitless and can\u2019t get over the fact that no such intervention can produce that type of cognitive enhancement. The neurobabble used by a lot of promoters and \u201cBinaural Beat\u201d enthusiast is just a confusion tactic. It is manipulative and disgusting. There is not a single contemporary study published in a reputable journal that has demonstrated binaural beat efficacy. Yet there are people claiming binaural beats will do anything from cure depression and enhance focus to give you the ability to get clairvoyant abilities. The whole proposed mechanism is just ridiculous, as the brain is not just a godamn sine wave generator. If binaural beats could do half of what most people claim it could do, it would be in regular use in the medical field. But it isn\u2019t. It is used by homeopaths/naturopaths/conspiracy theorists/mystics. That should speak to its merit but if you don't trust me look at the scientific literature on it Pilot feasibility study of binaural auditory beats for reducing symptoms of inattention in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperact... - PubMed - NCBINo more effective than a placebo in ADHD Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess neuropsychologic, physiologic, and electroencephalographic effects.No significant physiological changes and an INCREASE in depression subscales The impact of binaural beats on creativityThis study attempts to relate binaural beats to creativity, and to dopamine indirectly via eye blink rate. With such unreliable and subjective indicators, they would have a large sample size right? Nope, 24 people. And even then they found no difference on creativity on mood induced by any range of tests binaural beats. They did find a small change in \u201cdivergent creative thinking\u201d, but in a Frontiers Journal with 24 subjects, these results are as good as garbage. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231835/This study FLAT OUT advertises HemiSync, which if you read the wikipedia article, resulted in inconsistent EEG changes, and inconsistent effects on pain perception Eliminating the Attentional Blink through Binaural Beats: A Case for Tailored Cognitive EnhancementThis study, another fantastic Frontiers 22 person study, couldn't find any effect that Binaural beats had on cognition, but with some statistical magic, found a 3 way relationship that was significant with a quadratic relationship. A high-density EEG investigation into steady state binaural beat stimulation.No significant effect on vigilance ",

You need goo pair of headphones. The best studio standard headphones for the price are Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms for $150, but cheaper will work as well. Isochronic tones does not require headphones, but i would still use headphones to eliminate the noise of surroundings. These things are safe, but You also need to find a decent youtube channel for high quality production. I would suggest Greenred Productions since it\u2019s the top level resource: Greenred Productions ",

Some will experience headache and fatigue immediately after listening because their brainwave is being forced to alter from its normal state.[1] Footnotes[1] DrNepal - BrainWave Meditation Music",

Several years ago I downloaded some meditation music, Om Harmonics, and have meditated to the tracks several times with no problems at all. However I would also recommend that you check out Singing Bowl meditation music. I\u2019ve found that to be the best, but you\u2019ll need to decide for yourself what is the most calming. ",
