            "answer_text": "You better start off with FL Studio. It\u2019ll be easier. Musical experience is important, You should be completely through and known to the genre you\u2019re gonna produce. Everything develops with time. The answers to your question - EDM production can be learned from scratch. But you need to have your will power stronger than ever. But yes, Musical theory is necessary. Music theory helps you with various things about what comes next or what should\u2019ve come here. Download FL Studio and start watching the tutorials on YouTube.Music theory is important. I wouldn\u2019t say that it is necessary as long as you believe in your ears (Which is hard and comes with experience.) Learn atleast one instrument, that\u2019d be enough.I am happy to see your determination. Yes, 2\u20133 hours per day for learning and watching tutorials would be enough for (6 months.) Yes, 6 months. Only learn and gain experience. Once you think you can go ahead, start experimenting in your DAW. It\u2019ll take you almost a year for full production experience. (Don\u2019t fear failure!)Necessary? I don\u2019t think so. Because the money you\u2019d invest in it isn\u2019t worth it. If you really wanna spend money to learn, join Lost Stories Music Academy. By the way, There are lot of masterclass/How we made it classes on YouTube. Do watch them, they\u2019re really helpful. And, Lessons of KSHMR! They\u2019re available for free on YouTube.It will be difficult but not impossible. Once you\u2019ve mastered one genre, you are free to explore more. I\u2019d recommend you to watch HeadHunterz\u2019s Youtube videos. How from a hardstyle producer, he turned to House and Future bass.Hope I\u2019ve answered them accordingly. Never give up on your dreams! Keep learning and have fun! Cheers! ",
