            "answer_text": "Unless you are buying vinyl or have a top-class stereo system or very discerning ears, it probably isn\u2019t worth worrying about too much. It is true that the mono mixes were cared for and/or worked on more because they were the original way these recordings were meant to be heard. So for example, you may hear certain vocal effects on Lennon\u2019s voice in mono that you won\u2019t hear in the stereo versions. But whether you actually like these effects and/or find them worth listening to is entirely subjective. Personally, I think the stereo recordings sound great and rarely feel the need to listen to anything else. The definition and detail is amazing. It is true that there is more separation on some of the recordings. Vocals will be isolated to one channel and drums and guitars on another. It might sound a bit odd or dated but I actually prefer it. Once you get to Rubber Soul, that issue no longer is relevant. The stereo box has three more CDs than the mono box, including Yellow Submarine, Let It Be and Abbey Road, since those were never issued in mono. If you really care, get both or mix and match through secondary sellers. A rule of thumb is mono for everything before Rubber Soul and stereo for everything after. But even that rules has problems because the mono version of Sgt Pepper\u2019s is actually wonderful and an historic mix in its own right. Again, you really can\u2019t go wrong. Also note that Help! and Rubber Soul have original pre-1987 stereo mixes that are are bonus tracks on the mono set. They are not very good. George Martin was not the producer of these tracks and the mix is primitive. In 1987, Martin remixed Help! and Rubber Soul for the CD releases and those mixes have been remastered and are found in the stereo box. They sound great. It\u2019s confusing though since some may think the stereo is inferior just by listening to the original mix of those two albums. ",

            "answer_text": "I would have to say that the Mono version is more viable if you wanted to hear the albums as the Beatles originally intended, as they recorded almost all of their albums in Mono, and it was re-mixed after recording by the studio into Stereo- which was not the intent of the band.  While both the new collections sound amazing, certain songs sound better in mono than stereo and vice versa. Though the mono version is a couple albums shorter, the other two are easily bought by themselves, giving you a taste of both. but, in truth, it is a question of personal preference. The Beatles preferred mono, but most people would rather listen to the stereo versions. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkInLoqs180 (this is mono)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDl0qPfkSRw (this is not) I prefer the mono version, and I own both versions, but it's all up to your own taste. Just go on youtube and listen to mono versions and the stereo versions, and buy the set that you think sounds better. ",
