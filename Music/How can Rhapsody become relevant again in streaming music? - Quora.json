            "answer_text": "Rhapsody will definitely have to step up their game. Spotify offers powerful apps across many different platforms and devices that make listening to music easy and enjoyable.   Beats, although we can really only speculate at this time, might offer bundled features that are integrated with fancy headphones and integrated iPods. Before they were bought buy Apple, I definitely enjoyed their curated playlists by known music trend setters. Lots of newcomers to be considered as well... Amazon Music has launched a powerful music management and music store application. Eyes will be on TIDAL as they get ready to hit the market in the States as the highest playback quality service. The recent Google purchase of the curating and themed playlist service Songza.com (theoretically) in junction with the Google Play store could be a powerful player.  It's all speculative at this point.   Controversial Grooveshark is also changing their game plan from streaming music for free, to offering a similar service to Spotify but with a dollar cheaper subscription fee.  (However, they will still be impacted by the fact that Apple does not accept their app into the app store.)  I'm interested to see how their \"broadcasting\" feature will set them apart.   How can Rhapsody stay in the game? Difficult to say since they are already in the dust considering the dynamic the market has adjusted to. ",
