            "answer_text": "Here is an alternative you might not think of to get a reasonable quality new for under $100 - build it yourself. There are a number of Tele-copy and Strat-like kits you can purchase for under $100. I\u2019m assuming US dollars, the question did not state origin country and generally only my USA friends are cheeky enough to assume they are the default. Normally these are unfinished, but finish can be found cheaply. And, as you progress you can upgrade components as your finances improve. After all, if you build it, and set it up, you\u2019ll know how. I\u2019ve attached one I built - base price was less than $100. The thing that makes it quality more than anything else is the amount of time you put into the setup. Try fleabay. Or google any number of the kits sellers online.  ",

            "answer_text": "There aren't any new that sell for under 100, but there is some for 99 with are Mitchell and rogue brand guitars at most music sellers. They are decent. However if you want something that looks cool too I'd recommend mahar guitars. People win them only at carnivals and like chuck e cheeses. So they can't be bought new, but the people that win them usually don't play. I seen one guy have 3 of em for sale lol. I bought a grim reaper design one for 45 but they sell regularly for under 100. Honestly it's as good as a 300 dollar instrument. They play great however when set up and I can't vouch for Mitchell or rogue as I've never played them. Also sometimes squier strats go for as low as 30!! So look for used ",
