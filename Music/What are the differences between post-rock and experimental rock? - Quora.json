            "answer_text": "Experimental Rock is more closely tied to rock music than Post-rock simply because it still uses the common structure of songs and riffs that is typically associated with rock. Post-rock, while using the same instruments and textures of sound (such as an electric guitar sound), completely disregards this common structure of songs and riffs to create a completely unique sound. Experimental Rock experiments with this rock sound, while post-rock completely disregards it. ",

            "answer_text": "Experimental rock takes the base rock orchestration and modifies it towards more eccentric orchestrations and instrumentations. Post-rock takes rock instruments and sounds and plays something not rock with it. TL;DR - experimental uses rock fundamentals, post-rock uses rock instruments. ",
