            "answer_text": "There are two ways I know of My parents saw Pitbull last year. As you might know, Pitbull seems to be unable to record a song if it's not a collaboration. What does he do during his shows? He simply has the musician\u2019s recorded part playing.I also saw City and Colour last year. There's a part in one of his most popular songs, Sleeping Sickness, that is performed by Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip. City and Colour simply sang that part himself on stage, and nailed it like a champ. You might think \u201cOk, but that only works when the two segments are of the same genre\u201d. Wrong. Rap group Flobots has a song called White Flag Warrior where the chorus is performed by Tim McIlrath (a punk rocker and Rise Against\u2019s singer). When Flobots perform the song live, they sing the chorus themselves in the punk-rock style: it works surprisingly well.",

            "answer_text": "Hi Logan! Thanks for reaching out to me. As others have stated, there are a few different ways to perform these songs. Most artists arrange the song to have someone in their band singing the part. Mike Mac Donald and Pattie LaBelle recorded a duet(On my Own) and when Mike played for us, his drummer( a chick) sang Patti\u2019s part and she nailed it. Many bands also used pre recorded sd cards for music parts and harmonies. I don't like it much when they do this for vocals. It isn't fair to the people paying big bucks for a ticket. If they are a strong vocal band, like Ambrosia( check them out if you are not familiar with them!) They sing all their parts. Gonna brag a bit\u2026.I have been lucky enough to sit in with them a few times over the years,as well. A great bunch of folks,who is always a pleasure to work with:) Hope this answers your questions. Thankyou for supporting live music! ",

It featured Aimee Man, then of \u2019Til Tuesday, singing on the chorus. When her part came around her face appeared on a screen and her pre-recorded vocal played. I saw David Bowie perform \u2018Under Pressure\u2019, he famous duet with Freddie Mercury. He had a current band member perform Mercury\u2019s part. ",

For example, Rosanne Cash, recorded the song, Sea of Heartbreak, with Bruce Springsteen on her album, The List. When she sings that song in concert, she says, something like, \u201cBruce couldn't be here tonight, so John Leventhal will play his part. \u201c I've seen many artists do this over the years. ",
