            "answer_text": "Samuel Osborne Barber\u2019s Adagio for Strings has to be the saddest piece I\u2019ve ever come across, classical or otherwise. I don\u2019t believe Barber could have expressed such sadness without having had firsthand experience of it or maybe he could empathize with pure melancholy just as well as he could compose. Whatever it was, it made me empathize with the sorrow that he poured into the making of this piece and he achieved that without the use of lyrics. This piece rouses in me a longing that\u2019s been kept suppressed all my adult life; a longing for the memory of a past when it was all so much simpler. I found myself remembering happy fragments of my childhood that I didn\u2019t know even existed in my memory. What followed was a fleeting atmosphere shift to the utopia that once was my life and what followed that was the regret that the feeling was all too short. I\u2019ve learnt to use such \u2018Portkeys\u2019 sparingly because I know the more I\u2019d listen to that piece the more it\u2019d morph into my present life and out of the one I once had. And were that to happen, I\u2019d no longer have a telescope, if you will, into my past other than my faulty and often distortive memory. ",
