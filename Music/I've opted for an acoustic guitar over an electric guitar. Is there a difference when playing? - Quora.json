            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a difference, but I think it is good to start on an acoustic. For one thing, for family outings, or whatever, it is really nice to have a guitar you can take to the beach or camping. You will have no trouble making the transition to electric guitar once you have learned to play on acoustic. Because of the amplifier, electric guitar can be played with less effort. For example, on acoustic, the only way to play louder is to pluck and strum harder. On electric, you can play very easy most of the time and get the volume you want with the amp. However, I highly recommend that you start with a guitar that uses metal strings, rather than a classic-style guitar that uses nylon strings. Yes, your finger tips will get sore at first. But you will get calluses after a while making it much easier to play whatever kind of guitar you pick up. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but that\u2019s alright. If the acoustic is what calls to you, that\u2019s where you should go. Much of what you learn can be applied to playing electric, if you decide to do that later. I play both acoustic and electric, and while they are different, there\u2019s a great deal that they have in common too. No commitment to one or the other is required, especially so early in the game. Acoustic guitar won\u2019t require you to get involved with footpedals or amps just yet, which is fine too. Those things can wait until you\u2019re ready for them, if ever. ",
