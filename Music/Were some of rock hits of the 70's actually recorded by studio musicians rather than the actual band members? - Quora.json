            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to limit to just the 70s. This has been true in popular music since the beginning of recording technology. What changed in the 60s is that the \u201cband\u201d became a recognized entity for the general public, whereas previously it was usually just a singer. That singer could be backed by any musicians, and very few listeners knew or cared who they might be. Buddy Holly had his Crickets, and Elvis had varying groups through his career, but the star was the star. When the Beatles and other groups became big things, record labels were still stuck in that older mindset, and usually wanted to think of bands as a star singer plus some backing musicians. They were wary of relying on untested players to get them hits, so they brought in musicians from their stable of studio regulars. The Beatles managed to avoid this, but many other bands did not. It was the record labels putting up the money, so often the bands didn\u2019t have the clout to demand otherwise. ",
