            "answer_text": "Dare I answer that question, I don\u2019t think he had it planned beforehand. I believe that it was more of a (tragic) spur-of-the-moment decision. I find it unlikely that he ever went to sleep thinking \u201cI will take my life on July 20th\u201d. His late friend, Chris Cornell\u2019s birthday was definitely a rough time for him to go through and he probably had been dreading that date for days, but I don\u2019t picture Chester as the type of person who would decide on which day or particular moment to end his life. Firstly because I think it is unusual for people who have suffered from persistent depression as long as he has to pick a precise day and decide that this day will be the last and secondly because I think - and that is highly subjective - that he is a spontaneous person.  photo : Study Breaks Magazine Even though suicidal thoughts have alienated him for most of his life, having those thoughts and planning a suicide attempt are two different things and while the former put an undeniable strain on him, I don\u2019t think the latter especially occupied his thoughts in his last days. I can only assume that going through the motions of his day-to-day life, he might have felt that nothing altered his negative mindset anymore, lost hope that anything ever would and decided to do what had tempted him all along. I am almost certain that playing with his kids on that precise day did not come into the equation of balancing reasons to live for versus reasons why I no longer want to live. He may have felt hollow, not wanting anything more from life, because that is what depression is about to me: feeling that nothing is worth the effort, especially life itself and more importantly you actually don\u2019t care about anything anymore. That kind of feeling is strong and when you\u2019ve felt that way for a long time, you might snap, rather unpredictably and decide to end it. EDIT : I have watched a lot of interviews since I wrote this and retrospectively, I\u2019m thinking that Chester might have considered taking his life on Cornell\u2019s birthday a little more strongly than I first thought. I still believe that his mind was not completely set on what he was to do, however it is likely that sinister ideas were gaining ground in his mind, getting heavier every day, ever since Cornell passed away.
