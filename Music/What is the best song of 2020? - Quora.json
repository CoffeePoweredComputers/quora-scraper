            "answer_text": "I haven't heard one song yet that was released this year. Music has become a charade; merely a money making enterprise. Gone is passion, dedication, talent and longevity. Some singer is mustered up from somewhere, that voice is mixed on the soundboard (to death), the lyrics are juvenile and meaningless, the music is all digital, no instruments, then the whole thing is put together for the public's listening pleasure, and falls short in a thousand different ways. It is lackluster at best. This isn't one song; this is a repetitive process. The studios don't even care that you think it's lousy. There's always some sucker out there they can pander to. The question was \u201cWhat was my favorite song of 2020?\u201d The answer is there isn't one for this year yet. Maybe the coming months will reveal one. ",
