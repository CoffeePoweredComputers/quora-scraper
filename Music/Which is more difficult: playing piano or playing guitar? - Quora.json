            "answer_text": "I play both guitar and piano. I learnt piano first, when I was 9 and it\u2019s very easy to start playing. In fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s much easier than guitar as a beginner because you just press the keys and a clear sound comes out. You don\u2019t have to tune the piano every time you use it or change the strings like on a guitar, so a piano is very simple and uncomplicated to learn on. I\u2019ve been playing for 50 years, and there are different methods you can use on the piano, like the classical approach where they teach you music theory and how to read music, or the Suzuki method, where you learn to play by ear, and learn to read music after you can play. Some people like one way and others like the other. You\u2019ll get faster results with the Suzuki method because you\u2019ll be able to play complex songs quite fast, which is very satisfying. But learning theory is essential if you really want to play at an advanced level or write your own music. My daughter tried the classical approach and hated it, her music teacher would not teach her anymore and told me my daughter had no talent for music. So I decided to teach my daughter to play by ear. Within a year she was loving the piano and could play some very complex pieces of music. She has now become so good that she demo\u2019s pianos at a music store :) and is finally learning music theory because she writes her own songs. So if you\u2019re not sure try a little of each method and see what suits you. As for guitar, I picked it up when I turned 30 haha, yes a veritable geriatric when it comes to learning a musical instrument. I thought it would be very hard to learn and everyone told me that I was too old to get good on guitar. Well, don\u2019t believe a word of it..Within three years of picking it up I was playing Jimi Hendrix covers in a band\u2026. Compared to the piano the guitar is a very different instrument to learn at first but very quickly becomes easier. First you have to develop strength in your fretting hand in order to hold the chords. So the first few months on guitar can be very frustrating and painful and you need to persevere at this point because it gets a lot easier. Your fingertips will hurt a bit, not much but enough to notice. Once you get over that first phase of learning 4 or 5 basic chords and keeping rhythm with your strumming hand, you\u2019ll actually be able to play about 90 percent of pop/rock/blues songs written over the past 70 years !! So the guitar although physically harder to learn initially, rewards you with a huge level of satisfaction early on in your guitar playing studies, because you can actually play songs, sing, join a band etc, plus it\u2019s mobile, try taking a piano to the beach and playing it there (I did once, it was such a cool experience but it took a fair few people to move it haha). I found the guitar was a much more social instrument than piano as I would get together with friends and jam, after a few months of playing (ok listening back to the recordings we sounded pretty raw, but it was so much fun). I\u2019ve been playing guitar for 30 years now, and everyday I learn a new technique, or a new way to do something. On Piano, because the sound is made for you by the instrument, playing techniques are very simple. The differences between Guitar and Piano are manyfold. On guitar, your fingers make the note so you spend a lot of time learning how to \u2018articulate\u2019 or form notes clearly. On Piano the note is made for you by the instrument. But in terms of expression, a guitar wins hands down. On a piano you can alter the way a note sounds by hitting it hard or soft. You can use the pedals to sustain or choke the notes slightly, but that\u2019s pretty much the expression you\u2019ll get from a piano. On guitar, you can slide notes, bend them, wiggle them (vibrato / tremolo), change the sound quite dramatically based on where you pick the guitar, add different types of harmonics, choke the notes, mute them, strum with your fingers or a plectrum (pick) or you can fingerpick, or use both hands to tap the notes, or use it like a drum and tap on it and many more tricks. All these tricks take a while to learn on guitar, and again you\u2019ll find it takes a few years to master them. In terms of playing approach, piano and guitar are very different. The piano is linear (1 dimensional), where all the notes are layed out for you in a straight line. That\u2019s great for soloing or playing scales, but harder if you\u2019re playing chords, because you have to learn lots of different chord patterns for each type of chord, like a major chord can be played many different ways depending which note it starts on (the root note). Same with scales. Guitar on the other hand is like a skating rink , it\u2019s a 2 dimensional instrument, so you can play up and down the neck or across the neck. On a guitar if you learn chord patterns, you can just move those same patterns up and down the neck to get different keys or root notes. So in that sense guitar is much easier than a piano to play. Same goes for scales, you learn a scale pattern then you can just move the same scale pattern along the neck to get a different key. Where the piano beats the guitar is in learning music theory. Because all the notes are layed out in front of you on a piano, it is easy to visualise the musical theory you are trying to learn. On guitar it\u2019s not quite as obvious, although as you get more proficient you can easily learn theory on a guitar too. I\u2019ve taught guitar for quite a number of years and I always have a keyboard on hand when I\u2019m teaching my students music theory as it really helps them to visualise what I\u2019m talking about. Each instrument has it\u2019s own beauty and I compose commercial tracks using both instruments and I love playing both. So no reason you can\u2019t learn both. But one thing you should really do before you decide. Many music teachers offer the first lesson free. So try both, guitar and piano. See which one feels \u2018right \u2018 to you. I know it\u2019s a very touchy feely answer but you\u2019ll find you might like one over the other or hate both and decide to play the saxophone or drums haha. Really you need to try and find what\u2019s right for you, that\u2019s the most important thing, and is also the reason many people learn an instrument and quit after 6 months, because they really hate it. So don\u2019t be afraid to try. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who plays both, I\u2019d have to say that both show their own difficulties at time. With the piano, it\u2019s tricky and sometimes overwhelming to have to many notes displayed right in front of you and expect you to press them in the correct and make sound. Although, as \u201cJames Knox\u201d said in a previous reply, \u201cI can teach anyone how to play Mary Had a Little Lamb on the piano in 5 minutes. I can't guarantee that for the guitar. To simply play a note on the piano is far easier than to simply play a note on the guitar--the guitar involves using muscles that are likely not well developed for non players whereas stricking a piano string can be done simply by dropping your hand all willy nilly like on the key.\u201d Many piano songs require very complicated hand movements that cause you to stretch your hands in ways you\u2019re not used to, and to tackle the speeds and amount of piano you need to cover within those speeds. What I mean by this last thing is that some songs require you to play some notes on all octaves within a few measures. Guitar can also be tricky and overwhelming. It\u2019s sometimes hard to remember what each note is, switch quickly back and forth, to apply to the right amount of pressure, to remember which strings to strum, etc. Playing a string instrument, as also stated in the quote, requires the use of muscles and stretching you\u2019re simply not used to. Lastly, learning to play guitar, for me at least, was extremely painful. Not only did I face hand cramps and sore hands, but the formation of calluses was extremely painful. My fingertips hurt to the point where I was almost in tears at one point. I\u2019ve never personally faced much pain from playing the piano, besides your occasional, temporary hand ache from stretching too far. Now, I\u2019m not saying that you cannot get pains from playing the piano, but this is my personal experience. I\u2019d say it really depends on what song you\u2019re learning and what your skills are. Personally, though, I find guitar to be much harder. In my opinion, it requires the use of more physical and mental skills than piano. I\u2019ve played for 6\u20137 years and still am not as great as I\u2019d like to be. I still find myself majorly struggling with bar chords and fingerpicking in general. Even though I find guitar harder, this may not be true for everyone, because musical ability is different for each individual. If you have experiance with playing mandolin, for example, guitar would probably come easier to you than to someone who has no musical experiance. The best way to decide is to try each of them and judge it yourself. Each of these 22 answers may be different, because no one can tell you what would be easier for YOU with the lack of description you gave us. That is, because no one can tell you. Some people are born with natural talent. Maybe you\u2019re a prodigy in guitar, but you\u2019d really have to try to see because there\u2019s no other way (that I know of) to tell. ",
