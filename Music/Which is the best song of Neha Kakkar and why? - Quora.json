            "answer_text": "My all time favourite songs from the Neha Kakkar songs collection is \u201cKala Chasma\u201d song from Sidharth Malhotra and Katrina Kaif starrer \u2018Baar Baar Dekho\u2019 have become an instantaneous chartbuster. It's far a remixed version of a famous song from Prem Hardeep and is sung by means of Neha Kakkar, Amar Arshi, and Badshah. Neha again takes the tune via its horns with a flirty, light tone to her voice and is brilliantly complemented with the aid of Amar and rap verses from Badshah. general, at the same time as the video version of the track is a whole eye grabber, it is just as catchy all via itself. The music video of 'Kala Chashma' has crossed over 20 million views in just a week and was trending video on Youtube.I always use Saavn app to listen this song in Neha kakkar songs collection on Saavn artist page.
