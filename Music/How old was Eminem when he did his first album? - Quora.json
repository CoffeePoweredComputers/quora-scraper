            "answer_text": "His first solo studio album- so nothing with Soul intent or D12 though those were not really \u2018albums\u2019 EPs are like mixtapes with a few songs on them- was Infinite released in 1996:  Its not a square album cover because this was released on cassette not CD or vinyl. Eminem was born in October 1972 and this was released November 12 1996 so that means that he was 24 years old at the time of release. You have probably never heard of this album, it was not a commercial hit- it sold around 1000 copies- and few knew about it outside of Em\u2019s hometown of Detroit. I don\u2019t think this is what you had in mind for Eminem\u2019s first \u2018album\u2019, his breakout album was the Slim Shady LP released in 1999:  Notice the square shape meant to accommodate a CD release This was his first commercially successful album and here he many concepts and ideas which would reappear or be referenced on later albums were seen for the first time. This album was released on February 23 1999, which would make Eminem 26 years old at the time of release. This album was a huge hit due to the dark, violent \u2018Slim Shady\u2019 alter ego- it is after all Shady\u2019s album- and due to excellent production (beats) by Dr Dre (if only Dre produced Em\u2019s latest album, the beats make it unlistenable).
