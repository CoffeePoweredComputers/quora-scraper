            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you one answer. It\u2019s because they\u2019re Korean. Now, this may seem strange, but Koreans actually tend to be very touchy with another if they are close, family, friends, or in a relationship. Don\u2019t get your hopes up with the last one. Jungkook has said many times that he thinks of Taehyung as an older brother. I get extremely offended - although I shouldn\u2019t - when I see Instagram accounts and Youtube accounts dedicating their time trying to prove that two men are in love - to the point of photo-shopping pictures to make it seem like JK has hickeys on his neck. Imagine if you were hugging your friend and people started making ship accounts for you and taking pictures of everything you did with your friend, and disregarding the circumstances. It seems like those accounts are so desperate to prove something that ultimately causes rumors for BTS. I used to be a big shipper of Taekook, despite my current stance on them. I think it\u2019s mostly younger/newer ARMYs who ship any couples, as when I shipped them I was about 14 to 16. It\u2019s been 2 years since then, and I\u2019ve also realized that: If they did come out, they would lose MANY, MANY, fans. Why, you may ask? Well, it\u2019s mostly because of Korea\u2019s opinions on anything that isn\u2019t straight. I myself live in Korea and I have seen many homeless women and men who were disowned because they came out to their parents, not to speak bad about my homeland. I\u2019m perfectly fine with you being whoever, whatever you want (I myself am Pansexual but that really doesn\u2019t matter). Fans would lose interest if they came out, mostly because many fans, Korean or International, only lust for the members. But I think, if they ever DID truly come out, we should support them and their choices. ",

            "answer_text": "For a band which has been together and lived together for seven years of their lives, they\u2019re bound to be tighter even in public than what society believes as \u201cstraight.\u201d Jungkook, being the youngest or the maknae, is loved and cared for by all six other hyungs who love to baby him and spoil him, so this unrestrained affectionate showing of love may lead to rumors regarding their sexuality. Furthermore, Jungkook has said multiple times that he is closest to Tae, and he truly regards Tae as his older brother. Jungkook DOES have an older brother in real life, but being separated from him and his family at the age of 15 to live with other boys must have been extremely frightening for him. Add on top of the fact that he still is extremely shy to begin with, and you get small Jungkook in an introverted shell. If you\u2019ve been an ARMY for a long time, you\u2019ll know that Jungkook was so shy he wouldn\u2019t shower until everyone else had gone to bed. But Tae, with his cheerful attitude and hyper personality, was the first one to get through Jungkook\u2019s shy personality and bring out the golden maknae we know today who is unafraid to bully Jin and make the lives of the rest of them a living hell (they\u2019re literally so afraid of this muscle pig he even said he loves his thighs I\u2019m screeching). Undoubtedly, Jungkook would naturally be closer with Tae and be much more comfortable around him. It\u2019s best not to spread any rumors about them being in a relationship unless BigHit or BTS themselves have confirmed it. But with their handshake, their jealous behaviors when the other\u2019s attention has been taken away, the things they share in common, and everything else in between, who knows? Taekook may just be real :) Follow me on Instagram: BTS \u205c \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 \u205c DDAENG (@intro.youngforever) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos for more! ",
