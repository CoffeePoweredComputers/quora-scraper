            "answer_text": "No kpop group that I have encountered or stanned is racist. Before, anyone says anything, let us all take a look at the definition of \u201cracist\u201d RACIST re\u026as\u026ast/ noun 1.a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.\"I had a fear of being called a racist\"synonyms:racial bigot, racialist, xenophobe, chauvinist; More adjective 1.showing or feeling discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or believing that a particular race is superior to another.\"we are investigating complaints about racist abuse at a newsagents\" Here are somethings everyone should know: Many Kpop Idols out there have very little or no knowledge about the culture outside Korea, unless they once lived in any of those countries.They are not educated by their companies in cases like these. If an artist says something which turns out to be racist and sounds racist, majority of the time, the idols are not even aware about the effects of their comments. Twitter might explode with hashtags showing anger towards the idols, but unless they have a social media account, they never really get to know of what they have done. The company does it\u2019s best to keep such things under wraps. I clearly remember, recently there was an incident where Chen from EXO made a remark which was racist, which I 100% agree to. Many EXO-Ls waited for a formal apology, but it never came. So an EXO-L decided to educate Chen about it at a fan meet, and from what I heard, he was confused and surprised. He probably was not aware of what he did and hence never thought of apologizing.Sometimes, the main causes of such issues to arise is LITERAL TRANSLATION AND MISTRANSLATION. (is that a word?) Many people translate the idols\u2019 in the most absurd way.So, my conclusion is, How can you call them racist when they themselves are not aware of what they say? When they have no motive of proving that their race is superior than the others? But yes, I can tell you all about one Kpop idol who repeated her mistake, and this time, it was no mistranslation. WENDY from Red Velvet.   Wendy lived in Canada and United States, so she was in a position where she should know that doing something like that is not acceptable. If she did it once, it was okay. But she made the mistake twice. Wendy, personally, used to be my bias. I was not hurt by the incident because I am brown and not at the right position to say if what she did was okay or not. but, many people out there found it offensive and racist. For now, Irene is my bias. I decided that I will Support Red Velvet, because the other members do not deserve to be bashed for Wendy\u2019s mistake, but nevertheless, I won\u2019t look at Wendy in a good light until she apologizes.

            "answer_text": "No groups as I know is RACIST. And they can\u2019t technically be RACISTS because groups like EXO and BTS, they have a LOT of non-korean fans and so they should not be racists. And they are not racists too. I know that EXO has LOTS of non-korean fans (for example like Arab fans or Indonesian fans) and BTS has lots of American fans and in America, there are lots of diverse people so they literally have global fans all over the world. And if the kpop group is RACISTS for some reason, they will loose fans but that has never been happened and should never happen. :) ",
