            "answer_text": "You won't harm a bass amp by plugging a guitar into it.    There is also nothing  intrinsically harmful about plugging a bass into a guitar amp. It's just an amp. It doesn't care what you've plugged into it. The term guitar amp means it's designed with the frequency range of a six string guitar in mind, same with a bass amp. Also keep in mind that technically, guitars go into the bass range. The second string 1st fret is middle C on the piano and anything below is considered \"bass\". It's the upper range of bass but guitars can go fairly low. Guitars with a low B go even further into this range. I also sometimes play with an octave pedal that plays notes in the bass range.     Speakers are a different issue. Guitar and bass speakers are designed to handle different frequency ranges. The fairly thin strings of a guitar won't move the speaker as much as the thicker lower pitched strings of the bass. So, playing a bass through an amp into a guitar speaker is going to damage the speaker at some point. It may crease the speaker without blowing it out completely. You probably won't damage it so easily at very low volumes. Keep in mind that a guitar amp won't give you the full range of bass that would quickly damage a speaker at low volumes. Concert or rehearsal with a drummer volume however is not a good idea. A bass amp into a guitar speaker is not a good idea. Speakers also won't sound good when pushed beyond their design limits.     Bass cabinets are also usually closed back.  This helps to equalize the pressure on the speaker when playing.      With enough abuse, you can blow speakers in general, guitar through guitar speakers or bass through bass speakers.    Always, remember that amplifiers need to be set to match the ohms of the cab. Amplifiers also always need to have a speaker load or a built in or external load box so the amp doesn't blow. Never mix up speaker jacks with effects loop jacks. Always use a speaker cable not an instrument cable. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends a bit on how big the bass player is, and how annoyed they are that you are using their amp\u2026 You can\u2019t harm a bass amp by putting an electric guitar through it. The other way round is a bit more difficult: if you put a bass guitar through a guitar amp and turn it up, depending on the amp, you can blow out the speakers because of the power in the lower frequencies. It probably won\u2019t affect a Marshall 4x12 cab much (I lent my 4x12 and Marshall 2203 to a bass player for a year in the 1980s, and they are still both fine now), but a budget combo amplifier may not survive well. Bass amplifiers and speakers differ from guitar amplifiers in a number of ways. First, they tend to have much more headroom before distortion. Distortion, or overdrive, through a valve (tube) amplifier is part of the characteristic sound of rock guitar, and many amplifiers for guitarists are designed to overdrive easily. They often have a separate input or channel for \u2018high gain\u2019, to overdrive easily. Bass guitars have a higher output anyway, and bass players are often looking for a clean sound up to floor shaking volume. If the bassist wants overdrive, she or he will often use a pedal to do it. For that reason, it is usually fairly difficult to overdrive a bass amp. Second, bass amps often have much better tone-shaping than guitar amps. On my aforementioned 1978 Marshall JCM 2203, the tone controls really don\u2019t do a great deal. The amp sounds great, and the tone controls give you some fairly subtle flavours of that greatness. Anything more, and you either use an external tone control or change the guitar. Bassists, on the other hands, have to work hard to keep their frequencies from interfering with everyone else, so their tone controls are often advanced, with significant gain and boost, possibly a swept middle, and a number of buttons such as \u2018scoop\u2019, \u2018bright\u2019, or to change the frequencies at which the controls operate. Third, bass amps will typically have an enormous amount of power available. This is because the human ear \u2018hears\u2019 bass much quieter than treble. A bassist may need a 150W amp to compete with a guitarist on a 20W lead amplifier, because the bassist wants a clean sound, and needs more power to sound the same volume anyway. So you may find that bass amps are a lot heavier than you expect, even if they are relatively compact. Of course, if you\u2019ve been playing (as noted previously) with a full Marshall stack, an Ampeg SVT really isn\u2019t that much bigger or heavier.  One of the most famous early guitar amps is the Fender Bassman. This was originally designed as a bass amp, but the relative lack of headroom and generally uninspiring feature set left most bassists unimpressed. However, guitarists loved it. The Bassman smoothly moves into a creamy overdrive. Marshall reputedly copied the Bassman and respecced it to give it a more-guitar friendly feature set. The Bassman was the first valve amp I ever played on. I loved it, though, a year later when I came to buy, it was the Marshall rather than the Bassman I went with. I\u2019ve played through Ampeg SVTs and Portastudios, and through a big Trace Elliot. Bass amps are especially good for acoustic guitar, because the things that the bass player is looking for are essentially the same as what the acoustic guitarist wants. If playing acoustic, and you have to plug into something, plug into the bass amp rather than somoene\u2019s lead amp. ",
