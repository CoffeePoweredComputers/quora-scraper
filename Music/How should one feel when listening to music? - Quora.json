            "answer_text": "Feel? I am the music. Everything else fades away and reality transforms into fireworks so mesmerizing that I completely stop existing. The light sound of strings are bright strokes of light blue in the air, the bass is the taste of wet earth, the clear notes of a piano the feel of glass, the raspy voice of a guitar the smell of rain in the summer. If I am an empty sheet of paper, then music is aquarelle painted with the enthusiasm and imagination of a 5 year old filled with glee over the world and it's wonders. It is colourful and bright, drippy and messy, and entirely life-changing for a sheet of paper. I feel music the same way I feel everything, way too much and way too intense. I treat my playlists on Spotify as my bible, and I have about 100 of those. Not even exaggerating here. Two of which has over 500 songs. I never go anywhere without a pair of headphones, even in situations where I probably won't use them. They are just as essential to me as my glasses or my phone. Additionally, I own 6 pair of headphones, 8 if we count those that are half-working. I remember people by the sound of their voices rather than their faces, and god help me but theres nothing that gets me crushing on someone faster than the way they sound. Anyone, and I mean anyone, that can produce good music makes me feel love towards them. It's my curse, my weakness, my Achilles heel. I know it's such a clich\u00e9 to say that you wouldn't be able to live without music, but in my case I think it's actually true. A few years ago, I was heavily depressed and suicidal. The extreme loneliness and isolation drove me to a place so dark that I became convinced that light never existed. Music was one of the few reasons I didn't kill myself. It helped me, and is still helping me to understand myself, my feelings, my thoughts. If I ever were to go deaf, I'd most likely fall straight down into that horrible hell, and this time I wouldn't have my lantern to guide me back. Music is such an enormous part of my exictance. When I put my headphones on, press play on one of my many playlists, what I feel is whole. I feel whole. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on what you listen to. For example when I listen to this:  I feel chilled and happy. When I listen to this:  I feel sad. Because it reminds me of the time I was sitting pleading with God that my father would pull through after having a stroke, which left him in a really bad way. When I listen to this:  It calms my soul and makes me feel at peace after the emotional turmoil I\u2019ve been trying to recover from. And when I listen to this:  It reminds me of days from the past when I was happy and just wanted to enjoy life. So when you ask how should one feel when listening to music, it really depends on what your listening to. How you feel is up to you. ",
