            "answer_text": "How do you define good? For me, he is the best the guitarist of 2000\u2019s. He added so much on what was being played by hundreds. What I mean by that is, I honestly got sick of the cliche, \u201cshredding guitar\u201d playing, there is nothing pleasant about it if you ask me. Jack White, honestly, is incredible with the music he crafts in my eyes. Every piece of work, is like no other, some say he rips it off from Led Zeppelin. Slightly accurate maybe, but to an extend, it is not easy to duplicate Zeppelin my friend. Who does that in today\u2019s music? Or should I ask, who can? Nobody. Also, it should be noted that Zeppelin itself crafted songs inspiring from former blues bands. Blue Veins,to give an example, a beautiful piece of work, that gathers all the beauty of blues. Complex but immensely emotional at the same time. I, as a big fan, believe he lacks in vocals, but when I listen to him, I don't care about how good or bad he sings, I just think and appreciate the emotional intensity of his songs and the incredible dance of the guitar in the ritual he engineers. You can find the emotional intensity in many of his songs. Death Letter, Will there be enough water?, Love is Blindness and many others I can't think of at the moment. Hopefully this answered your question. ",

            "answer_text": "In my (not unbiased) opinion, Jack White is the greatest guitarist of my generation and the greatest Rock-and-Roll performer of this era. Having read some critiques of his playing here, I can tell that those who dislike his style value different aspects of music than I do. The thing that never fails to come across when he plays is his wild infatuation with music, and no one does a better job of drawing in the audience to his obsession. Lets look at a few different facets. First, his wild raucous electric guitar. Here he is playing Ball and Biscuit live in Paris. I have seen more than a dozen performances of this song and the solos have never been nearly the same:  He can also do toned down and subtle guitar work, as we see here with Will There Be Enough Water:  What about slide guitar? Entirely different skill, but Jack kills it just the same. Here is Death Letter:  He can even play and bowl at the same time, as he proved in an alley in Saskatoon:  And if you need him to tone it down because, say, he\u2019s playing a show for elderly British veterans at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, he can do that too (and notice how easily he connects with the audience as well):  Sam I Am: \u201cA bus! A bus! A bus! A bus! Would you, could you on a bus?\u201d Jack: \u201cHell yeah, I\u2019ll play it on a bus!\u201d  Sam I Am: \u201cWould you, could you on a boat?\u201d  What about if he cuts his hand in the middle of a solo and is profusely bleeding on his guitar? How does he handle that?  Here\u2019s his guitar after that set:  And, although this doesn\u2019t showcase his guitar skill, I had the great personal pleasure of witnessing, at a show in Union Square, that even if you tell him he\u2019s out of time and turn off his microphone and amplifier, that still won\u2019t stop the show:  Not only is Jack White one of the most phenomenal electric guitarists in history, he exemplifies what it means to be a Rockstar of the very highest order. His passion for music and for the shared experience of playing with an audience is truly magnificent. If you are still in doubt, I got more videos for you:   And, just because I can, here is his set at Bonnaroo in 2014. Hands-down one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen this decade. If you don\u2019t feel like watching the whole intro, you can jump to the 10\u201312 minute mark and you will still get lots of magic:  Jack is my favorite. ",
