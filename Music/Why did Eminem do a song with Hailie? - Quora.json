            "answer_text": "Because he loves his daughter very much and always dreams and tries not to give her a traumatic childhood that he himshelf faced..unlike other rappers eminem\u2019s lyrics reflect his life story,his thoghts and his lifestyle..and the only thing that he is concerned about more than anything else is how to give a hailie a proper and safe childhood\u2026 his wife left..his mother..well we all know that part very well..Eminem is the only family hailie has..But sometimes due to all the pressure and drama of being a celebrity added to the problematic life he himshelf faces..well he looses it and does all the things that hurt or will hurt her indirectly in the future..You can take the example from many of his song especially the song \u201cKIM\u201d where he literally abuses his wife (Hailey\u2019s Mother)openely..Everything can\u2019t be perfect like you wish for\u2026Eminem mentions her daughter in the lyrics and features her voice (My Dad\u2019s Gone Crazy) in his songs only to make her undetstand how much he loves her and also to tell us all how much insecure he is about being a good father..

            "answer_text": "Let me put it this way, so you can picture the whole story. Ja Rule, in one of his songs, \u201cLoose Change\u201d, says: \u201cEm, you claim your mother\u2019s a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what\u2019s Hailie gonna be when she grows up\u201d. This song is a diss to Eminem, therefore knowing that Ja Rule mentioned Hailie\u2019s name on his track, he thought to come up with a song where Hailie Jade, his daughter, is also included. And so he did. He released a song, called \u201cHailie\u2019s Revenge\u201d and there, before the beat drops out, he has a dialogue with Hailie, where he says: \u201cHailie, come here, baby. Bring Daddy his Oscar!\u201d. Also, in the end (outro) of the song, Hailie asks her dad: \u201cDaddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?\u201d. Eminem adds: \u201cNo, honey, you guys are the same size\u201d. So, basically, the reason why EM made a song with his daughter, Hailie, is because he wanted to oppose Ja Rule in a very cynical way! ",
