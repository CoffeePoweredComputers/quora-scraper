            "answer_text": "Music has always played a very sociopathic role in society as a whole. In 'my opinion',(and if you also research) there are about a small handful of music industry 'heads' that are responsible for what music is made 'public' or popular. They have complete control of the artist who gets to 'make it' and that is where 'selling your soul to the devil' is applied. Many people who realize this too late and refuse to cooperate are usually the ones in tomorrows headlines who die at the young age of '27'. (2+7= \"9\") THAT is a symbol of their doing. They 'invented' folk, disco, grunge, heavy metal, rap and whatever the hell that crap on the radio IS today. They systematically control the masses and they can 'make' you or 'break' as a music artist in a minute. Same applies to movies, politics, retail and religion. But remember opinions are like a%& holes; every one has one. Fight the good fight. peace :) ",
