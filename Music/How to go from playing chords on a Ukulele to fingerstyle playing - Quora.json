            "answer_text": "Beginning to fingerpick on a ukulele is very much a case of moving to the next level. Like most learning processes, beginning the uke follows very much a \"sawtooth\" pattern. You'll gradually get slightly better (or sometimes slightly worse) from one practise to the next, then once in a while you'll have a great session and make a lot of progress all in one go... or, you'll feel like you're hitting a brick wall and get nowhere. Fingering can be one of those brick walls, but you already can see what the effect will be - you'll take a dull \"strum\" and turn it into a lively performance. (I have a measure of success for this; after my nightly session, my wife may say \"That sounded nice\". I'll ask \"So, what was it?\" - she won't recognize a dull strum, but she will recognize something that I've started to add a melody layer). There are two keys to getting started with fingerpicking. The first is \"muscle memory\". Your fingers will learn scales and chords without your brain getting involved - after a while, your fingers will begin to know their way around the fretboard and know which frets \"make sense\" for the current tune, or the current key. The second key - there are as many ways to pick as there are ukulele players; many notable players develop their own fingerpicking style. As I write this, I'm beginning to add pick notes myself, and what's surprising is that my fingers already appear to know \"how\", after all those chord drills and simple strums. Here's a few of the techniques that have worked for me, with some examples. \"Attack angle\" - this is all about how you hit the strings when you strum. Not only can this be the direction (up or down) but by angling your strum slightly you can hit the lower (or the upper) strings with different weight. Because the uke's two \"outside\" strings are the higher-pitch ones, you can accentuate the melody like that. Think of it much like how a violinist tilts the bow to sound out a single string. This sounds complicated, but in actual fact can be very natural. Your ear, your hands, and your instrument will make it work. Example: Waltzing Matilda Uke tab by Traditional can easily be made more dynamic by loading the strings like this.\"Sloppy changes\" - When you first strum a song, you might do something like \"strum-strum-strum--- oh-quick-move-my-fingers -- strum-strum-strum\". Experiment a little. What if you only move one finger before strumming the second chord, then move the other fingers later? Again, you'll be surprised that your strumming exercises will have already taught your fingers a good place to go! Example: Tiptoe Through The Tulips Uke tab by Tiny Tim - that first line \"Tiptoe through the window\". Change the C to a G7, one finger at a time, for \"through the\". Not easy to explain, since I found out my hand/ear/brain connection was doing it for me automatically...\"Spare finger\" - this is a great one for the uke. One of the nice things it has going for it as a learner instrument is you have four strings and four fingers. You could in theory never need to \"barre\" a chord. However, given the chance, try to play every chord so you have a finger to spare, which you can put down to pick out the melody. Again, your fingers may already know where they're going. If you have a chord that's particularly hard to get right, be lazy and miss a finger out - you may find you can get away with it (for example, sometimes an A7 just sounds better than an A). Example: Don't Bring Me Down Uke tab by Electric Light Orchestra - that whole first line \"You got me runnin' goin' outa my mind\" is all on A. Very dull to strum. But you've got a spare finger (or two, or even three if you play A7 instead). Fret out \"3-3-2-0-0-2-0-3-3-2-0\" on the E string (ring finger and pinky sit nicely on frets already!) and strum along with the words...\"Magical musical theory\" - a personal favorite based on muscle memory. Because your fingers learn common chord patterns in a particular key, you'll quickly discover you know a lot more music theory than you thought? Played something in the key of C? Then you'll probably want to finish with flair and strike C,F,C,G,C. You might be playing a song on C,G,Am,F and suddenly realize that sounds like something else (obligatory link) ...  or perhaps that F doesn't sound right. Maybe a Dm or an Am would work better? Example: King Of The Road Uke tab by Roger Miller - let's begin with \"spare finger\" for the first C chord - drop a finger on the third fret of the E string for the second syllable of \"Trailers\". Next chord is F for \"sale or rent\". Again, you want to pick the melody out, but the first note doesn't work. Try a Dm instead... you get the picture. (You can go through the whole song like this). Above all, remember, there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\". Do what sounds good... as part of that, continually expand your repertoire and learn more songs, there are so many common chord progressions that, once you learn them, they'll be instantly available to throw in a spare finger or two to spice up a performance!

            "answer_text": "There are many paths from chords to notes but the royal road is arpeggios. Arpeggiation. Start with that. What do I mean? Well, you are already learning the campfire version of songs by playing cowboy chords up at the neck. One easy thing you can do without learning anything new is start playing the chords as arpeggios, meaning plucking each string in the chord individually. Typically, you can play the strings in any order and if you stick to the same order as you move through the chords changes, wonderful things will happen. Sometimes it won't be wonderful so don't be slavish. Feel free to play more than one pattern as you move around. This is a nice sound and you may enjoy just doing this for a while. It's not the full story on fingerpicking though so eventually you will want to try some other things, like adding passing notes that are in the scale or the chord (or even not), adding single-note runs between arpeggios, mixing chords, arpeggios, and short note sequences, and so on. Tab can be fun for learning specific songs and picking up some useful patterns and habits, but it doesn't \"unlock\" things for you quite so directly as playing around with arpeggios. ",
