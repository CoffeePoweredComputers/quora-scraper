            "answer_text": "I'll tell you how I did it. I always thought I was a good singer, but through years of experience realized what good really meant. I started singing at 6, was picked for all the solos in church choir, then Jr. High and High School. I had good parts in musicals and got high scores at contests. Of course it really helped to take piano and play sax in the band so I could read music well. Then I went to college, and although I got a good scholarship I realized all the other students were about the same level as I was. The level of singing was so much higher there and my ego was knocked down a bit, but I kept working hard at it (practicing about 4 hours a day) and did well. When I graduated with my undergrad degree I thought I was a big shit ready for New York, so I moved out there and started taking lessons and auditioning (I was 30). I quickly learned I was a small fish, trying at a relatively late age to swim in a big pond. But I found a good voice teacher who knew people, so I was able to audition and was accepted to be represented by a small talent agent. I thought \u201cI'm set. My agent\u2019s going to get me all my singing gigs\u201d. So I sat back and waited for the audition times with the big companies and shows to come in. After a year of paying the agent and only getting a few auditions for small parts, I started to realize that no important agent would have taken on an artist with a short resume and little experience, so I got out of that contract. Also learned that tons of people out there are looking to take advantage of young singers, telling you you're great and that they have what you need to succeed in the business. (Ex. The best workshop, big connections, and my favorite, \u201cTeacher To the Stars!\u201d). So I worked hard on my own to set up auditions and get my own work so I could build up my resume. I continued taking $150 lessons and would crash any audition I could. After listening to hundreds of singers from back stage, I really started to realize where I was rated, talent wise, in this biggest of ponds called New York. I knew I was an excellent musician, not just a singer, and felt I rated about a 98 out of 100 compared with the best singers in my voice type (bass-baritone). I was getting fairly good and consistant gigs, and had a better agent, but was not making the money I was expecting to make by my age (40). By this time about 80% of the singers I started with in my early 20s had gotten out of the business, and I was thinking about it, but decided to audition for a Master's program at a music concervatory, and got accepted by the Manhatten School of Music. This was confirmation that I was singing well, but at my age a big soloist career was hard to see. To wrap things up, I continued my schooling and got my doctorate in voice performance, continued singing and was on the voice faculty at two universities, and have run 2 opera companies and written a book on voice technique. To answer your question. I now know a good singer when I hear one. ",

            "answer_text": "I am tempted to just say that you instinctively know if you can sing or not. I am also assuming that you mean \u201cCan I sing well?\u201d. Anyone can sing, but it may or may not be good singing. As for me, I knew I could sing well when in 4th grade, our class was asked to sing at a city event. Only a select number could go, and I was one of kids picked to go. That surprised me, becuase I knew I liked to sing but I didn\u2019t know that I was pretty good. My mom always sang around the house and I picked up the songs and sang along. She pushed me to join choir at church, but I didn\u2019t want to take the time out of my play to go to rehersals. I fought it and usually won. After the concert in 4th grade, we were given ice cream as a reward. That\u2019s when I decided this singing stuff wasn\u2019t so bad after all. If you are chosen by an unbiased person to sing on a consistent basis, you should consider that you show some promise. You can\u2019t really depend on a close relative to tell you if you can really sing, or if they are only being nice by not wanting to hurt your feelings. Another way to tell, is to record yourself and listen back to it. Is it pleasant and on key? If so, you can sing, but that doesn\u2019t tell you if you have a good or great voice. There are many shades to \u201cgood\u201d singing. When I was in 6th grade, we had arts classes that included 9 week rotations of music, art, and homemaking. My first rotation was in music. I became very ill and missed almost half the classes. The teacher said I could make up work by chosing a musical theatre song to sing on the stage in class. I chose \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d dressed in a nun\u2019s costume. The next day, that teacher requested that I spend the year in music instead of rotating. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was that good or that bad. Experiences like that kept happening in school, so I decided that maybe I could do something with it. Have you considered taking voice lessons? A good teacher will talk to you and ask you to sing some scales and maybe a song or two. Then the teacher will tell you their opinion of your voice, and if you should seriously study voice or not. They may say to start immediately or perhaps to wait a while if you are a young teen. A young voice may be damaged by starting to train too early. Join a choir, perhaps in school or at church. After you\u2019ve been there a while, are you being asked to do solos or join small groups to sing specialty songs? Lastly, does it matter how well you sing? It does if you plan to major in it at college or want a professional career. But, if you love it, who cares if you can or can\u2019t sing. Just do it and have fun. ",
