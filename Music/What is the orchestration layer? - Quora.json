            "answer_text": "A cloud orchestrator is programming that manages the interconnections and interactions among cloud-based and on-premises components. You would be combining tasks into workflows so the provisioning and management of various IT components and their associated resources can be automated with any number of tools or managers. Common orchestration tools (other than those already built into most cloud providers) are Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, Jenkins, etc. They allow you to do what you would normally do as part of your build and deployment process in an automated and (more importantly) consistently repeatable way.
