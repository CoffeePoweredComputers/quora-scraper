            "answer_text": "\"Purpose\" is not song it is album of Justin Bieber. Purpose is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released on November 13, 2015 by Def Jam Recordings and School Boy Records. It serves as the follow-up to Bieber's third studio album Believe (2012), and it was developed after the release of his compilation Journals (2013), which saw him musically in a more R&B direction. The album was created over a period of two years, in which Bieber struggled to find a musical direction for recording, scrapping each of the tracks on the album many times. Bieber has stated that the sound and the lyrical content of the album were heavily inspired by Chris Brown's 2012 album Fortune. Please Share and UpVote my answer, if you find this helpful. ",
