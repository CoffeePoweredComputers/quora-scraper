            "answer_text": "Very broad question is though easy enough to broadly answer. First things first, I won\u2019t take into account the agent, lawyer, or management fees. That\u2019ll be too hard to explain as agents, lawyers and managers all get different rates and fees depending on the job they did for securing the concert. For a one-off show or a concert where the artist doesn\u2019t do surrounding shows in the vicinity, a singer will usually go for an Artist Guarantee of at least 60% of the Gross Revenues of the show. Rarely will they do % of the gate if it\u2019s a one-off show in a market they are not familiar with or with a promoter they aren\u2019t familiar with. So if the promoter or venue predicts to make $1M USD, the artist should be looking for at least a $600k guarantee paid before the show happens. ",
