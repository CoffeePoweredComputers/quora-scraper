            "answer_text": "In my way of understanding tonal harmony, the Em7 chord in the key of Bb major is a \u201cforeign\u201d chord, which is to say it is neither diatonic (strictly from the key of Bb major or a tonicisation of one of the chords from the key of Bb major), nor can it be construed as a modally-borrowed chord, since it does NOT contain a B flat in it, so it cannot have come from one of the parallel modes of Bb. To my way of hearing, the Bb diatonic chords and their tonicisations sound very similar to each other, in the way that siblings resemble one another. They are closely related. The chords borrowed from the parallel modes of Bb (like Abmaj7 contains the b7 so is borrowed from Bb Mixolydian, or Ebm7 contains Gb and Eb, and so is borrowed from Bb Aeolian) all sound similar to each other as well, in the way that cousins resemble each other but only distantly resemble the original siblings. Foreign chords that cannot contain the Bb in their chords scales cannot possibly come from a mode of Bb, so they sound fresh, but have trouble fitting in. This might be what you are hearing. If the progression is actually modulating, this is another story, but if the progression stays in Bb major afterward, it is simply an example of a foreign chord. The chorus of \u201cSir Duke\u201d by Stevie Wonder contains this chord. If I put it down a semitone from the original key of B it is as follows: Bb Em7 Ebmaj7 F7sus4 F7 It sounds quite fresh here, but doesn\u2019t modulate. ",

            "answer_text": "Emin7 appearing in a Bbmaj chord progression is a modulation. To me, all modulations sound interesting. This one is particularly smooth, \u201cbecause\u201d (and I use that term very loosely) E-7 is the ii7 chord in Dmaj, which is a key with a chromatic mediant relationship to the original Bbmaj. Chromatic mediant relationships simply sound interesting and good in general. Chromatic mediants to a given triad are six other triads found a third away (up or down, major or minor) and containing at least one note foreign to the key signature of the given triad. For example, if Bbmaj is your original triad, its chromatic mediants are (above) Dmaj, Dbmaj, and Dbmin, and (below) Gmaj, Gbmaj, and Gbmin. Or if you prefer thinking about Cmaj, its chromatic mediants are Emaj, Ebmaj, Ebmin, Amaj, Abmaj, and Abmin. If you modulate to a new key which is a chromatic mediant relative to the original key, it\u2019s going to sound interesting. It\u2019s a reliable way to go \u201coutside\u201d smoothly. ",
