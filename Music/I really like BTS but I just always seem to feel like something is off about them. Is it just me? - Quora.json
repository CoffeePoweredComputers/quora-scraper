            "answer_text": "No, it is not just you. Many feel something is wrong because their action or behavior doesn't seem right from their previous demeanor from before, and assume based upon that they are depressed or bored of the idol life. But I think no one is expected to stay the same and you grow, you begin to gain more experiences that adds layers to your personalities after all, your personality is defined by your experiences, and as you have more, your personality starts to take shape so, it\u2019s only natural that the members begin to change their behavior and actions according to the situation. Even if in one moment, they make look tired or bored, or off, it doesn't mean they are like that all the time. In fact, in other situations, you see they act differently because they adjust accordingly to the situation, and seem happy and cheerful, as if there is nothing wrong with them. But it doesn't mean they are happy all the time. So, we shouldn't assume how they are feeling usually based on one instance of their behavior because it doesn't determine what they always feel as their feelings alter in certain situation. However, I do understand that sometimes, we do tend to worry about them because the way they behavior and look just seems different from how they look usually as they always put up with their persona to be happy and cheerful to them. To appeal to people with their impressionable and approachable facade. But that is only their facade and we never know how they truly feel when they don't reveal anything to us to not make us worry. So when they look off or different than usual, then it worries us, especially since they are always bearing the pain inside of them without ever revealing, so we are fried that they might break down and unravel and just let it all out. No more BTS. no more persona. there was only pain. it was so much pain. they were drowning in darkness. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally don't feel anything \u201coff\" about them. The fandom? Sure. A significant section of this fandom absolutely sucks. But the boys themselves seem as sweet and genuine as they come. I can't tell you that what you feel is \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cnot real\" because it's your own personal feeling. All I can tell you is trust your gut and if you don't feel like you really \u201cclick\" with the members of BTS, there are loads of other K-Pop groups out there that you might connect with better. It's ultimately up to you who you decide to support and no one else can make that decision for you. Hope this answer helped!
