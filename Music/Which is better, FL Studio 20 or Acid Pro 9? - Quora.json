            "answer_text": "Fruity loops is the best DAW i\u2019ve ever used or seen so far. The only thing better might be to have your own keyboards synthesizers and drum machines effects processors and a good mixing board. This could run you into thousands if not tens of thousand of dollars. And there\u2019s a lot you still wouldn\u2019t be able to do with that.(some people use this equipment along with Sony\u2019s \u201cpro tools\u201d and sony jamtrax from what i hear. I\u2019ve never used pro tools or jam trax.) Fruity loops emulates these things and places them all in a small and relatively easy to use software. (It helps to have a good computer and sound card to run it). Acid is mostly about layering and mixing premade .wav files. Songs like those made by \u2018the prodigy\u2019\u2026 \u2018smack my bitch up\u2019 for example, have been made in daws similar to \u2018acid\u2019 \u2026well actually ableton which is similar to acid.  Other songs like \u2018animals\u2019 by martin garrix, were made in fruity loops.  ",
