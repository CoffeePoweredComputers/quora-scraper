            "answer_text": "I know Native Americans that like Black Americans and Black Americans that like Native Americans. Thus, your question could use some revisions, here\u2019s one: Why do some Native Americans dislike some Black Americans? Answer: A person\u2019s ethnicity does not determine who they will like or dislike, it is a personal choice that could be influenced by a number of factors including what they have been taught about other ethnicities or what they have personally experienced in interaction with an other ethnic group. Sometimes people unknowingly generalize their thoughts of an ethnic group based on their personal experience with a few individuals from that group and make negative or positive conclusions about the group. Some Native Americans may be aware that Black American soldiers (nicknamed Buffalo soldiers) played a part in the U.S. government exploitation of their sovereignty. So the dislike could stem from this negative association. Also, some Native Americans owned Black Americans as slaves and may disrespect them because of the stigmas that surrounds such a history. To generalize about the feelings of a group of people for another group of people when there can and are exceptions is very speculative and leaves little room for solutions unless more specifics are known.

            "answer_text": "For the same reason people all over the world do, even though they have never seen or met an African or African American person. Because of the portrayal of African/African American people in the media, movies and contemporary literature. America has spread its \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d ideology all over the world, to prevent POC from forming a unified front to combat it\u2019s exploitation, environmental degradation and destruction of the planet. Regarding African Americans and Native Americans, they utilized slaves and free African Americans to remove the indigenous population in the Western United States. Prior to this the New England tribes and the Seminoles incorporated African Americans to defeat the fledgling U.S. in several decisive wars. So the survival of the new nation, was dependent upon creating hostility between these two groups of people. This is still in effect today with blood quantums and termination policy, view the Freedmen vs. the Five Civilized Tribes and removal of Wampanoag lands from federal trust status. ",
