            "answer_text": "It should be noted that I am not familiar with the Indian market as I am some others, but my understanding of Spanish and Mexican music may help answer this question. There are some really great singers that are multilingual and have the capacity to sing wonderfully in whatever language they choose. The funny thing, though, is that when you find success is music, one of the keys to that success is branding. So, for an Indian singer, they build their brand on the ability and capacity to sing Indian music and songs. Their fans could possibly struggle with the fact that their beloved Indian singer is trying to sing in English. Similarly, English language music fans may initially, or consider the attempt at singing in English, \u201cselling out\u201d and find the English language project less legitimate. It\u2019s a finicky world, music consumers. This process of going for different market is what is called \u201ccross-over\u201d in the business. Crossing over, for multilingual artists, or even multi-genre artists can be tricky. There are many who attempt it, but few who actually manage to pull it off successfully, and rarely are both languages marketed and the same levels at the same time. Again, it boils down to marketing and where you want to focus your resources to engage your fans. The reality is that your favorite Indian singer may have the chance to sing English. They could even make an attempt to blend Indian styles with English language, to cross-over. My guess as to why you don\u2019t see more of this from Indian artists is that marketing and branding make them successful in the language and genre they started provides a level of monetary security they don\u2019t want to risk since there is not a high-rate of success for cross-over artists in any genre.

            "answer_text": "I guess, this is mainly due to English accent and pronunciation. We have very good singing talents in our Country. They excel in overall musical sense with a high degree of dedication. They are Grammatically sound from musical point of view. But somehow, I believe that most of them ( or none of them) are good in English!! Many of them don\u2019t know this language at all and those who know actually speak Hinglish instead. Though they may be superb singers. If you need to sing in English, you must have an impeccable accent with British or American pronunciation, which almost all the renowned singers in our Country are utterly missing, quite logically. Also, the western vocal needs a bit different focus & training as compared to Hindusthani or Carnatica Gharana. I am not sure if the famous singers of our Country are trained that way. Because it\u2019s too different from any of the languages in India, it requires a good orientation to the Western Vocal as well as good command over the English language in all aspects, to get a chance to sing songs in English in real sense with sustainability. .
