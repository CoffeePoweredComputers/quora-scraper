            "answer_text": "I got very frustrated (like what Sammy Hagar felt in I Can't Drive 55) trying to learn to play piano by ear from websites and online videos \u2026 until I came upon a few simple revelations. Here\u2019s a short answer on what it means (at least for me) and how to play songs by ear and find chords on piano (assuming you can already play a melody by ear with your right hand) presented in my 55-word poem titled \u201cI Can Jive in 55!\u201d To play song by earplay last note on Cto make learning easyby avoiding black keys. To add chords to songplay root BELOW melodyon the main down beatsat intervals 1, 5, 3. Now play each chordby playing ABOVE rootnotes 5, 8, and 10then add notes to suit. See video below with full demonstration of these three simple steps that unraveled all the mystery and quite suddenly (almost instantaneously after 40+ years of playing piano using just sheet music and rote memory) enabled me to spontaneously play songs by ear and play it in any key. Main Take Away: Focus on identifying the root-melody note intervals when playing songs!  ",

Good luck! ",
