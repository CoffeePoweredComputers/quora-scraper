            "answer_text": "When was the dominant ninth chord incorporated in music theory? After musicians started playing it. Music comes first, then \u201cmusic theory\u201d attempts to explain what those who actually making music are doing. It\u2019s not the other way around. What didn\u2019t happen: Some music theorist, with nothing else to do one dark night, decided that we need a blue note \u2014 one that\u2019s almost, but not quite, a flatted third. So he published it in Music Theory News, and way down in the Mississippi Delta, a guitarist picked up a copy in a barber shop and thought, \u201cHey, Man, I can dig that,\u201d and started playing the blues. No, the blues came first, with an African tonality that sounded slightly off to ears accustomed to European music. It was up to the music theorists to describe and explain what these musicians were doing. They heard the breeze in the treesSinging weird melodiesAnd they made that the start of the blues And from a jail came the wailOf a down-hearted frailAnd they played thatAs part of the bluesFrom a whippoorwillOut on a hillThey took a new notePushed it through a horn'Til it was wornInto a blue noteAnd then they nursed it, rehearsed itAnd gave out the newsThat the Southland gave birth to the blues!

            "answer_text": "The thing about music theory is that it has always been and always will be, we just put words and numbers to better understand the intricate physical relationship that is music. The dominant ninth, or flat 9, or flat 2, has always been used in music theory. It's a part of the super locrian scale, and can be a part of a synthetic scale. As for when exactly it became more prevalent in music I am not sure, but its use has been recorded in all different types of music's and cultures. ",
