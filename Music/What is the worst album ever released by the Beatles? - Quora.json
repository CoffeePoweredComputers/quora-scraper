            "answer_text": "I have to admit I over thought this question, because immediately I thought \u201cworst in what terms: song selection? placement of songs from start to end? initial sales?\u201d but I calmed down after reminding myself \u201chey man it\u2019s relative to one\u2019s preference..\u201d Like most questions of this ilk the answer lies within the individual\u2019s taste - I\u2019ve talked with people who saw no reason to listen to \u201cMeet The Beatles\u201d while others couldn\u2019t figure out why on earth \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d is still in print. And I\u2019ve met a couple of people who didn\u2019t make it past \u201cGlass Onion\u201d because \u201cif the rest of the album sounds like this I can\u2019t last for two records\u2026..\u201d so it\u2019s truly a matter of taste. Here\u2019s a story related to the question. Years ago I worked in the Dallas Texas branch of Capitol Records. One of the senior guys was retiring but I had a chance to chat with him off and on. I quizzed him about Capitol in the \u201960s and of course The Beatles. He said \u2018the only album by them we lost money on was Yesterday and Today, because of the cover debacle. Once that cleared up it finally made a profit.\u2019 So in the short term financial aspect you could say the Y&T album was the worst released during the Beatles\u2019 time together. I should mention what a difference wording makes in asking a question such as this. Had it been \u201cwhat is the worst Beatles album ever released?\u201d that would have opened the field to repackages in which case my choices would be a tie between the 1982 offering \u201cReel Music\u201d and 1976\u2019s \u201cRock N Roll Music - examples of how to package great music badly. Both had horrendous covers: the inside jacket to \u201cRNR Music\u201d sporting images of a \u201957 Chevy, a jukebox, Marilyn Monroe, and a glass of (I\u2019m guessing) Coca-Cola which also serves as the label design. It looked as though it was designed for a collection of \u201950s hits. \u201cReel Music\u201d isn\u2019t much better - get past the amateurish renditions of the Beatles from the various films and you come upon a \u201cbooklet\u201d that looked like it had been put together by the romantic partner of someone in the art department instead of an actual artist. Okay rant over. I provided responses which I hope proved helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few candidates (comments below relate to the UK versions): With the Beatles - no singles on it, lots of covers, some good originals but few standouts. Pretty short too. Beatles For Sale - made when the Beatles were tired and jaded, has covers, some songs that don\u2019t feel completed, few standouts. Also short. Magical Mystery Tour - not really an album, released as a double EP and then made it into an album years later by adding singles and B-sides. The double EP has 6 songs - 2 are great (I am the Walrus, Fool on the Hill), 1 decent (Magical Mystery Tour), other 3 are amongst the weakest songs they released (Flying, Blue Jay Way,Your Mother Should Know). Whole concept is a muddled and a bit silly (the cover, costumes, way it was released as not a proper album). Yellow Submarine - again, not a proper album. Released in the UK as 4 new songs and then the George Martin orchestral soundtrack (so not by the Beatles). In the US it was more of a compilation album using previously released songs. The 4 new songs (apart from the fun Hey Bulldog) were all throwaways that hadn\u2019t been seen as fit to release on previous albums (Its All Too Much, All Together Now, Only a Northern Song). Let it Be - a muddled album that lost its original concept (playing live, no overdubs) with the exact opposite (lush Phil Spector productions with added strings and choirs). Mismatched result is rather odd, leaving it more of a what could have been - the Beatles were splitting up and had clearly lost interest in this point. Songwriting is also uneven - Maggie May, For You Blue, Dig It - all inessential filler that would be best skipped, personally not a fan of the saccharine Long & Winding Road either. But remaining songs have some standout classics (Let it Be, Get Back) and there is a great feel on the \u2018live\u2019\u2019 tracks that remain truer to the concept, with some great playing recorded on the roof. So a good but not great album. Of course the worst Beatles albums are still great records, better than most other band\u2019s best records ! ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it all depends on what you are after. Some don\u2019t care for their first album\u2026 It is almost primitive compared with what was to follow. But it has its place and it has some indispensable songs. Yellow Submarine could be considered their weakest album\u2014it is certainly the hardest one to describe\u2026 Not even released as an album in the UK at first\u2026 Released in two different forms in the US\u2026 It\u2019s title song stolen off of Revolver, the four other songs not strong contenders for greatness (\u201cHey Bulldog\u201d might be the exception)\u2026. one version of the album having film score music, another a mishmash of A and B side singles\u2026. and yet it is a monument, in some ways, of exactly what was happening with the band at that moment \u2014 Confusion and mis-direction. Some say \u201cLet it Be\u201d is weak but it gave us a picture of the Beatles as a performing band again and, despite the misery shown on the film, the record is full of fun and hi-jinks and some really great Beatles classics. At the time of their release, each seemed perfect and inevitable. Looking back with an eye toward history and an understanding of the evolution of pop music, they all fill the right spot at the right time\u2026 to judge them with the perspective of a modern ear with no understanding of history is to do them (or any other work of art) a disservice\u2014but even with that kind of an eye, they hold up pretty well. I was in a Walmart recently and \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d was played over the overhead system. Weird. But I\u2019m telling you, that record still rips it up despite all the modern trends and technological advances our ears have been conditioned by. So\u2026 I guess it depends on who\u2019s asking and what they actually want to know. ",

So, the questions involves only the official Beatles\u2019 albums, starting chronologically from 1963 with the \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d LP and ending in 1970 with the \u201cLet It Be\u201d one (and no, sorry, the \u201cLet It Be - Naked\u201d is NOT a part of their official canon - and that remains a fact). So, according to all that, the answer is pretty obvious, as many others have already pointed out: \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d (1969) It\u2019s not even a complete Beatles album. The whole second side consists of the musical score for the film and it is not written by the Beatles themselves, but by George Martin (with the notable exception of the last one \u201cYellow Submarine in Pepperland\u201d. For some reason, I had seperated this track from the others the first - and only- time I heard fully this record side). The first side is a mix of oldies and newer stuff to serve the film (and to finish with contractual obligations), which, I have to say, it\u2019s not that bad at all - on the contrary, I find it pretty amusing and enjoyable! \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d stands out as the best track of the side, a strong rocker with a kind of sonic attack (plus, a catchy refrain for my ears - i still remember myself playing this song loud at my parents home shouting all over, in a rather cathartic manner, this \u201cYou can talk to me / if you \u2018re lonely you can talk to me!\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s All Too Much\u201d with its distinctive feedback tone stands very well on its own and, I have to confess, I even enjoyed as a teenager (and, hmmm, sometimes as an adult, as well) the childish \u201cAll Together Now\u201d - it may be childish, but it\u2019s also playful and very well-crafted, I admit! OK, \u201cOnly A Northern Song\u201d was kind of tedious, which makes it the weakest track. The other two (\u201cYellow Submarine\u201d and \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d are older stuff and were presented in previous releases, having gained already a status). This is certainly NOT a bad side of an album - many other bands of the era would struggle to yield an outcome of the same quality, even with its ups and downs. And there comes the side 2 and the whole album becomes flopped. To clarify one thing: GM\u2019s score is not bad, it serves the film pretty well. I cannot remember clearly that music score, in particular, but watching the film (years afterwards) was a pretty fascinating experience and this music score must had its own contribution to this. It simply doesn\u2019t work to be listened seperately, outside the frame of the accompanying film that was written for. This is not something entirely \u201cbad thing\u201d, many film scores / soundtracks don\u2019t stand well on their own - this is the case with that GM\u2019s score. But, being included here on a whole side of a Beatles LP brings an intense feeling of \u201cfrustrated expectations\u201d - which is a heavy burden. Plus, it significantly weakens the listening impression of the LP (sorry, mr. Martin!). In conclusion: the mean value of a pretty good side 1 and a, hmmm\u2026 flopped, side 2 is a mediocre album. Not bad at all, has its merits, but is by far the weakest spot on the official Beatles canon. If you care of having the \u201ctruly best\u201d of the Beatles album, there are plenty of others to choose (picking \u201cRevolver\u201d, for a start). On the other hand, for the completist, owning it is necessary, mandatory I would say - its four \u201cnewer\u201d songs at side 1 are not represented anywhere else. PS: As many others have stated, if you are in search for a real bad Beatles\u2019 album, meaning something that is totally crap, sorry, you are looking in the wrong place. There are no real bad albums in the official Beatles\u2019 catalogue. That remains a fact, as well. ",

It has more original songs than Beatles for Sale (as if that should be some measurement of quality \u2014 it isn\u2019t), but the two stellar Lennon singles, \u201cYesterday\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen a Face\" aside, most of the songs are second rate. \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Lose that Girl\u201d is good fun, but \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away\u201d is candy-floss Dylan that is saved only by the beautiful vocal in my opinion; the mid-tempo McCartney rockers are dull and the George Harrison songs are awful. \u201cTell Me What You See\u201d is supremely annoying. All of these songs have interesting bits: the Beatles certainly always tried their hardest to make songs work. \u201cAct Naturally\u201d I kind of like but \u201cDizzy Miss Lizzy\u201d\u2014compared to the Beatles other Larry Williams covers, especially \u2014 is a sloppy mess. I think it would have been improved by taking off the Harrison songs, and the covers and adding the two B-sides, the pleasant enough \u201cYes It is\u201d and the really rockin\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Down\u201d which kicks \u201cDizzy Miss Lizzy\u201d\u2019s sloppily double-tracked ass all over the room. It\u2019s still not a bad album. The heights are very high indeed and the lows are listenable and well-crafted. But I think the strain was telling on them and I think it\u2019s their worst album: yes, worse than Let It Be, which I think is ridiculously underrated, even though I admit that it\u2019s a bit of a mess \u2014 which is what makes it such an honest document.

            "answer_text": "A bad Beatle album doesn\u2019t exist. However, there of course has to be one that\u2019s not as good as the rest, also known as the worst of the best. To me, the album that would take that (dis)honor, not counting live or compilation albums, is Beatles for Sale.  Like I said earlier, there are no bad Beatle albums. Beatles for Sale has some great songs on it. Some highlights from Beatles For Sale are some of my favorite Beatle songs from the pre-Rubber Soul days, like Kansas City and I\u2019m A Loser. However, I would say Beatles For Sale has a considerable amount of covers and throwaway songs that other albums just don\u2019t have. It was released just 21 weeks after A Hard Day\u2019s Night. This is the type of work schedule that The Beatles would end up resenting. Beatles for Sale is an album that shows the band\u2019s fatigue at that point, struggling to produce the high-quality work that they wanted. There are highlights, but overall this album is a low point in a band that was never truly mediocre. We should look back and be thankful for Beatles For Sale, though, as if it weren\u2019t for it, The Beatles would have never tired of the mop-top, touring routine of the early 1960s. If there were no Beatles for Sale, there would have never been a Revolver or a Sgt. Pepper\u2019s. For that, I\u2019m thankful. ",

McCartney churned out a couple of brilliant ballads and George came up with the catchy \u201cI Me Mine\u201d but Lennon was just devoid of any interest.

While I am not a big fan of Let It Be, it has quite a few songs that I enjoy, including \u201cI've Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cI Me Mine\u201d, and \u201cTwo of Us\u201d, among others. The one album that I really don't like is Yellow Submarine. For one, about half of the album is the score for the movie. While this is not necessarily bad, I would rather hear the members of The Beatles singing. The only score that I enjoy is \u201cPepperland\u201d. The rest of the album is not much better either. The only songs that aren't scores that I like from this album are \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d and \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d. I feel like \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d is overrated and I find myself always skipping \u201cOnly a Northern Song\u201d, \u201cAll Together Now\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s All Too Much\u201d. That means that, in total, there are only three songs from the entire album that I will listen to. For being a Beatles album, it is a pretty bad album. It is definitely my least favorite Beatles album. ",
