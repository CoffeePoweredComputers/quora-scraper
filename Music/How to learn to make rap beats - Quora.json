            "answer_text": "Study music theory - You don\u2019t have to be Mozart but knowing some music theory can make beat-making easier. Learn proper beat structure - Rap beats vary depending on sub-genre. Generally rap beats will have snares, kicks, basslines, synth, hi-hats, hats, etc. in a repetitive loop. Keep it simple. When you try to complicate things, the beat will sound terrible. Make a loop for the verses and another one for the chorus. Get a studio - People suggest programs like Audacity and FL Studio but i personally don\u2019t like them. Audacity doesn\u2019t work well if you want to make beats from scratch. FL Studio only works on the Mac. I use Soundation - Make music online. It\u2019s free and a great online browser-based recording studio. You only have to pay a few bucks to get more sound packs. Aside from that, it\u2019s about as good as FL Studio. You can also get equipment such as a drum machine if you choose. Experiment - Play around with the instruments until you get a sound you want. I suggest you try to manually play them when you record. This will give you a more natural sound. Make sure you use a metronome to stay on beat. Keep editing, cutting stuff out, layering, polishing, etc. until your beat is finished. ",

            "answer_text": "Start by listening to beats that you like. Try and listen to the different instruments. What are they doing that you like? That you don't like? Is there anything that seems to be similar in all (or most) of them? Ask yourself a lot of questions, and listen to a LOT of music. Music you do and don't like. Also, just search \"instrumental rap beats\" on youtube. Then check out Soundation - Make music online . It's like GarageBand and the loops are made by the same people, but you use it right in your web browser. You combine loops by dragging them into the sequencer (if you arrange them top-to-bottom, they will play at the same time). Play around...again, see what you like and what you don't like. This will get you a basic understanding. From there, it's about writing your own loops, developing your own style, and finding the program(s) that work for you.  Hope this helps you to get started!
