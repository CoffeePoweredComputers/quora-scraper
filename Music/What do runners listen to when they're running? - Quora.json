            "answer_text": "I should start by saying that I *love* music and I listen to it as much as I can, so running is no exception. I listen to music on my daily train runs. I like mostly Indie Rock, but I will also listen to good Hip Hop, or even EDM. I have several Spotify playlists that I keep updating with my \"Recent Hits\". I also have a huge playlist with \"all-time favorites\". But, all of this is only true for my daily runs. I never listen to music when I run with friends. That usually happens in my weekend long run. We spend most of the run talking, so there is no point in listening to music. Finally, there are the races. I am very particular about what I do during races. I never start races listening to music. I like to focus on breathing and \"feeling\" the run. However, I do carry my phone and headphones with me, in case I \"need\" them. In races I use music as that one extra energy gel that gives me the final boost when I most needed. In a marathon I might end up putting my headphones on in the last 6 miles or so. I have a special playlist for that. It's called The Last Miles. This is a very personal playlist where I have songs that not only I really like, but also that mean something to me. Putting those songs on in those last miles works wonders! Btw, if you are curious, the idea of using music only as a last resource in races was inspired by reading Kilian Jornet's Run or Die. ",

            "answer_text": "I started doing some running this summer; at first I was mostly listening to music, but soon I switched to audiobooks. I realized that even running just 100 km per month is going to take 8\u201312 hours - including road to the park/stadium, some quick warm-up etc.. And that\u2019s like 1 additional decent book per month! Now it sounds like much better investment of time. A lot of people don\u2019t even read one book per month on average, and increasing mileage is also going to increase this number. I\u2019m mostly running alone, so I don\u2019t have to talk/listen to somebody while running; I\u2019m not doing it professionally so I don\u2019t care much about watching over my breathing, technique etc. Sometimes I switch to music - usually for last several km of the run; sometimes I run in silence if I have corresponding mood or want to check my technique and sounds I\u2019m making. In case of music, it is going to be some rock/metal stuff that I like, without picking something specifically for this activity (so my last.fm profile can give the idea about it). So far I only once faced a situation when I ran more than I planned because I reached interesting part of the book and got too distracted on it to keep in mind that I\u2019m also running :) But that\u2019s probably going to happen more often in future :) ",
