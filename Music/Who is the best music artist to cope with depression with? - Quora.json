            "answer_text": "That depends on you and your personal taste and music and what speaks to you. However, I can give you my choices for music that I personally find the most encouraging whenever I\u2019m anxious and feeling any sort of depression. I think, for me, having uplifting and fast-pasted electronic music with dreamy aesthetics, a solid beat, and positive lyrics helps a lot. Owl City Or any music by Adam Young. His songs are the epitome of positivity. He often sings about having depression and how there is always hope and things will get better\u2026 you just gotta keep on trucking. Some of his songs about having/overcoming depression and negative thought processes:    Oceanlab I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a music project that is anymore dreamy, beautiful, and dopamine-inducing than Oceanlab.    Mandisa I\u2019m a christian and so naturally, I like to listen to a lot of christian music. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re into that, but I promise you christian music is a wonderful cure for depression. The songs are clean, positive, encouraging, and remind you that you\u2019re not alone, that you matter, that God loves you, He hurts with you, and His intention is not that you suffer. Mandisa is one of my favorites!    Danny Gokey Another christian artist who I can\u2019t get enough of.    Honestly, I\u2019d suggest any christian music artist. Francesca Battistelli, Jason Gray, The Newsboys, MercyMe, Hillsong Young & Free, Plumb, Britt Nicole, Tobymac, Group 1 Crew, Capital Kings, SHONLOCK, Chris Howland, Gawvi. So many good ones. Progressive House Music As for just in general\u2026 any progressive house music instantly lifts my mood and reminds me everything is going to be okay.    So hopefully you like these artists and their music will help! <3 ",

            "answer_text": "When I'm sad, I feel better listening to sad music. Not sure if that's normal. A dancey, happy, singable song like Paul Simon\u2019s wonderful \u201cKodachrome\u201d won't cheer me up. REM\u2019s \u201cNightswimming,\u201d \u201cFind the River\u201d or Pattie Griffin\u2019s incomparable \u201cUseless Desires\u201d somehow make me feel less down.  Almost anything by Leonard Cohen. Doesn't make sense, but there you have it. ",
