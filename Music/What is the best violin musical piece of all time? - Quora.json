            "answer_text": "Before I became super interested in the violin, there was one group of related pieces that got my attention, and I listened to them frequently. It was a multi-album set of the Beethoven Piano and Violin sonatas. Because the stood out to a non-violin aficionado, that is my justification for classifying them as \u201cbest.\u201d To this day, I only tolerate the concertos. Sure, there are the famous beautiful passages, sometimes whole movements. But the Beethoven pieces can be ingested whole and repeatedly by someone who has no special love for the violin. The piano and violin have roughly symmetric and equal roles in the sonatas. These are listenable either as background music, or listenable closely at loud volume on audiophile speakers. I have never heard them played in person. I\u2019d like to. Many many years after first hearing them (as you can guess, since it was on vinyl albums) I am taking violin lessons. I am no where near playing them. I don\u2019t care. I got the music to #5 and started struggling with it. In my head, if no one actually listens, I sound just like the album as it soars and darts about. The piano exchange playing melody and accompaniment. I also play piano, and in my opinion, the piano part is a good deal harder. My goal is to be able to play the first two pages of the violin part by the end of the year. Anyone want to try the piano? The version I grew to so love is now available on mp3, downloadable from Amazon. You have to buy it in several chunks. The whole set is not available but you can get 5, 9 and 4. Either you\u2019ll get 9 twice, or you\u2019ll have to download individual movements of one of them. Search for \u201cBeethoven violin sonatas Denes Kovacs\u201d. You\u2019ll also find many performances on YouTube. My favorite of these is probably the #5 by Anne Sophie-Mutter. I like Kovacs better, but there is no video of him. ",

            "answer_text": "The term 'best' is open to interpretation.  By technically demanding pieces Paganini's 24 CapricesScherzo Tarantelle by WienawskiCarmen Fantasy by SarasateZigeunerweisen by SarasateEach of these pieces presents its own difficulties but interestingly enough, do not need any emotion being put into it. They're a matter of theatrics with lots of style and flair. They are quite fast in tempo and thus, do not require much emotional effort being put into the song except total technical mastery in technique. Truth to be told, I am sometimes put off by the Caprices as I feel that the notes make no sense at all musically and they're just being strung together because they happen to be difficult and sound complex. By emotionally demanding pieces Schindler's List by Itzhak PerlmanBach's ChaconneSonata in A Major by Cesar Fran\u0107kMeditation de Thais by Jules MassenetGranted with the exception of Schindler's List, these pieces also require some level of ability. However, they are in no level with the Caprices or any of Wienawski's works. They are also a bit slower in terms of the tempo and is not exceptionally difficult for the sake of it.  In short, we cannot really define 'best'. For the more analytical players they are going to find songs requiring emotional effort difficult and vice versa. Each violin piece will present its own set of unique challenges.  Not sure if I answered the question but with this, I hereby conclude that each violin piece is simply the 'best'! ",
