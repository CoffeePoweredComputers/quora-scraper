            "answer_text": "Ok, I hear the word \u2018real\u2019. If that\u2019s the case stay away from F&D for home theater. Philips high end systems are pretty good actually, but not sure on the entry/mid-range systems. My money would be on Yamaha YHT-196. It\u2019s about 25K (above your budget), but totally worth the extra price. You don\u2019t buy home theater everyday. Get something you\u2019ll use for years. ",
