            "answer_text": "They say You are beautiful the way you are. We are but what we behold. Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder. We have heard so much on this. I really have come across a lot of beautiful people so far and a few human form of headaches too. No wonder beauty lives in the human mind too. Beauty. It is different for everyone - thank goodness. I seek Beauty more than Knowledge. Infact,knowledge can be ugly. God has made the universe extremely beautiful. Look at nature, everything is beautiful. Look at rivers, mountains, waterfalls, forests, animals, birds and everything that is made by God. I can conclude it as whatever is natural looks beautiful. As little I know, these are some people whom I find beautiful. It really does not mean I don't entertain the rest of them. I firmly believe that Love can transform the way we see other people and ourselves. Here you go. Simplicity kills me more than anything. I find this beautiful.I like extroverts who listens too. I find this beautiful.I like those who tends to smile with their eyes when you meet them. They are the best kind of people for me. People with measured smiles. I find this beautiful.One who teaches their minds to stay with what's being said n not drift. I find them beautiful.Calm n composed personality( They are never hasty) I find this beautiful. True beauty is about who you are as a HUMAN BEING, your principles, your morals, your character. It is about how you make OTHERS feel about themselves in your presence (and after).One who can give you goosebumps when they talk with fearlessness while explaining things n relating it to their own experiences . I met one 55 years old young man(named Cethil) like that. I find this beautiful.There is lot unsaid between the lines. One who tries to see it closely. People who are working for our human race as in an NGO. I find them beautiful.People who don't blame God. I find them beautiful.The unconditional love of parents is what I find Beautiful : My mom is the most beautiful person I know. Not because she is my mother, but she still thinks I'm her 5 years old son. She always tries to know if I had eaten something or not. I call her twice everyday whenever I open my eyes n before I call it a day as I stay approx 800km from home. She often says \u201cGood relationships keep us happier and healthier.\u201d I think people who know how to make relationships healthy are beautiful.People who are humble. I find them beautiful.Passionate people are beautiful. I love when thier eyes start glowing whenever they start taking about thier passion.People who knows how to make babies. I find this beautiful. All I meant was if you are really on your way to find beauty in every person you meet, you will for sure.There is no end and vice versa.Confidence is what I find beautiful.Honest,openess n kindness. People who have these attributes are beautiful.One who knows the difference between cads n dads. I find them beautiful. What is ethically right or morally correct? Same goes for the opposite gender.Very organized and somewhat generous people are beautiful.People who often say good things n bless each other. Jesus did not say love everyone but He said love each other.Self taught people are beautiful. Yes, and I learned from other fields of art as well. Such as music, movie and writing; anything that evokes feelings has lead me to learn more about my own art as well.I remember a beautiful quote here. It goes like this. \u201cBeauty isn't about have a pretty face. It's about having a pretty mind, a pretty heart and a pretty soul.\"IT'S WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE THAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL! . A person\u2019s energy can either lift you up or bring you down, and after being in the presence of a truly beautiful person, you too will be left feeling beautiful.Musically inclined people are very beautiful to watch. I went to one music concert once and I was shocked to experience the beauty of music. Experiencing the classical music is really beautiful to me. Its almost close to heaven on the planet Earth. This world is not my HOME, I m just passing through. Out beyond the ideas of wrong and right there is a field... I'll meet you there. ",

            "answer_text": "Val has had the shit kicked out of her many times in life. Well, I think she has. But she doesn\u2019t see it that way. When you meet this 70-something lady, all you see is smiles, laughter, strength, determination and positivity. But I know things about her. Some things were plain to see, others were divulged over time, as our friendship grew. The first I knew of her was seeing her around town every single day, and in all kinds of weather, pushing her husband in a wheelchair. She\u2019d be out there, in hot sun, rain, or snow, pushing him two miles into town and two miles back. She\u2019d stop and talk to people she knew, laughing, joking and petting their dogs. Meanwhile, her husband, George, would sit, all bundled up in blankets, silently listening in. He could take everything in, he just couldn\u2019t speak much since his stroke many years earlier. She intrigued me. Gradually, I became one of the people she\u2019d stop and talk to. And as the years passed, I realised I was quite lucky to have met such a rare individual. We are now firm friends. She had been caring for her husband for roughly 15 years since his stroke. The doctors advised her to put him in a home, because he\u2019d require round-the-clock care and they were certain it would be too much for her. He spent a few short weeks in a home before she demanded to bring him home. You won\u2019t manage, they warned her. Like hell I won\u2019t, she told them. She\u2019s assertive, stubborn, and knows her own mind. She contacted the council and had them install a lift in her small house, at their expense. They cut a hole in her dining room ceiling, put in an industrial lift that could transport her husband, chair and all, upstairs with one push of a button. She brought George home and looked after his every need for 15 years. She lifted him, fed him, bathed him, dressed him, shaved him, cut his nails, helped him to the toilet and God knows what else. At night, she\u2019d wheel him into the lift and take him upstairs, where she\u2019d begin the whole nightly ritual of getting him to bed. And every single day, come what may, she\u2019d bundle him up and take him for a walk into town. She wanted him to get out and see people. When I\u2019d comment how dedicated she was, she\u2019d dismiss me. \u2018Nonsense! I owe him a lot. He took such good care of me when he was well.\u2019 She once told me that when he\u2019d sit, trapped in his chair, watching her perform one of his old household duties, he\u2019d start crying and mumble \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He felt bad that he was letting her down and she was having to do everything herself. She\u2019d give him a cuddle and reassure him that she wasn\u2019t doing anything he wouldn\u2019t do for her if the tables were turned. Every time I saw this woman, she was chipper, positive, jovial, practical, outspoken and determined. She never once complained about stress or hardship. On top of all she did for George, she also tended to all household needs, repairs and handiwork, on next to no income. Eventually, George passed away. There was a period of time afterward that she seemed quieter and sad, not quite herself, but I didn\u2019t see her cry. Shortly after, her young granddaughter died of cancer, leaving behind a one year old baby. Val handled it valiantly. Then her daughter got cancer (thankfully recovered) and still, Val stayed strong, never asking \u2018Why me?\u2019 The day she told me that her father had sexually abused her as a child, there was no sign of vulnerability or victimhood in her eyes. \u2018He was a rotten bastard,\u2019 she said, matter-of-factly. \u2018When he died, I told my family I refuse to go to his funeral and they could just throw his body on a bonfire, for all I care.\u2019 As long as I\u2019ve known her, she\u2019s done for others. She paints neighbours\u2019 houses, helps them with their shopping, tends to their needs, walks their dogs. But she is fiercely proud and independent and never asks for help of any kind in return. The closest I\u2019ve ever seen Val come to tears is when my dog, Pepper, died. That day, I went to see her and she hugged me so tightly and didn\u2019t speak. She felt as sad as I did, because she loved Pepper. Every day, for years, she\u2019d wedge a doggie treat through her gate, knowing that at some point Pepper and I would be passing by. He became so conditioned to stopping at her gate and pulling that treat out with his mouth, that even on odd days when she\u2019d forget, he\u2019d sit in front of that gate for half an hour, refusing to budge! To answer your question, I find traits like resilience, determination and positivity extremely admirable. People like Val, who never feel sorry for themselves and just get on with it. ",
