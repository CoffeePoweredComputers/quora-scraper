            "answer_text": "Art therapy, like several other forms of therapy, can help with mental health through appropriate releasing and processing of emotions, increase in self esteem, and integrating into more interpersonal interactions. Clients are able to work through their emotions through art with the art therapist; this is an outlet that they might not otherwise have. Being able to do this helps them feel like they're doing something (some clients do not before they begin art therapy) and increases their self esteem along with their sense of identity. Some art therapy interventions are done in group settings, helping the clients involved to interact with each other. It also helps that even in one-on-one sessions, they build rapport and trust with their art therapist. In regard to the recent tragedies, there is a lot of emotion that needs to be worked through. If people are willing to seek art therapy, it will help them. Edit: The way your question and that link are phrased, it seems you're asking about therapeutic art. While art does have some therapeutic effects and definitely helps many people and serves a significant role in people's lives, it's not the same thing as art therapy. I believe it helps, too, in a different way. It also helps with emotions and societal unity along with spreading much-needed messages. ",
