            "answer_text": "Jump They Say (from the album Black tie, white noise) The song is about the pressures which drive a man to jump to his death from a rooftop.  Bowie's half brother, Terry was diagnosed as schizophrenic after attempting suicide by jumpng from a window. He was put into psychiatric care but later escaped and died after being hit by a train.  As for paying tribute to his brother, well, that's a matter of interpretation.   Some people think the song Bewlay Brothers (from Hunky Dory) is also about Terry but Dave has said that the lyrics don't mean much and \"Americans like to read things into things\".  ",
