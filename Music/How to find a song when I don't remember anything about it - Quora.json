            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t remember anything about it, it would be impossible to find it. You can think really hard about certain things about the song that you may remember: that would be a start. If you remember the melody, you can try using the site Musipedia, but don\u2019t count on finding it there; any melody you input (using an alphabetic code describing the notes) can result in many possible answers. That\u2019s my best answer. Keep your ears open if you hear it again. If you hear it on the radio, you can use the \u201cShazam\u201d app to identify it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t remember ANYTHING about the song it does not exist. You need to figure out what you DO know, like, the rhythm, melody, where you\u2019ve heard it, if there was lyrics, the song style (eletronic, rock, classical, etc), which instrument is the main one\u2026 Then you try to google it with those clues in some clever way. Also, if you heard it on the internet, at a certain date, it is easy to find in the browser\u2019s history. ",
