            "answer_text": "Most people have covered this pretty well, and they are absolutely right. I completely agree with them. I will give you an unconventional view on how you could do it, and basically be all right. But it\u2019s not likely to be a forever thing even then. Location matters. Rent is what will indeed kill you financially. It would be the biggest bulk of your expense. \u201cLiving\u201d is questionable. You can probably exist that way, but prices continue to rise. The main problem is, you won\u2019t be accomplishing anything else but just living. You will eat a lot of rice, ramen and beans. That\u2019s not a bad thing for food - but the implication is you can\u2019t afford more expensive food. You would want to avoid eating out: the smart person would cook their own and save considerably on their food budget. You would be taking public transportation in the cities, or riding a bicycle or walking. Again, these are not bad things - it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t afford another choice. And food shopping this way is darned inconvenient. In short, you will be taking a minimalist approach to everything. Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing, if it\u2019s something you are choosing to do. It also depends on what your agenda is here: why are you choosing to do this? There is another way if you want to think about it. If I were to do it, I would buy a cargo van and live out of that. I would have a small fridge, a hot plate of some sort along with a 700 watt microwave, just enough clothes to not look homeless. You can buy an inverter that will convert DC to AC to power devices in the van. A twin or camping air mattress. Parking is a problem because most people know what vehicles belong in their neighborhood, so you will be eyeballed. You aren\u2019t likely to be parking in the same place every night as it would draw attention. Hostile attention. I would also ensure that no light leaked out from my van at night. Some people might say you can\u2019t really do this, but the answer is of course you can. Consider over-the-road (coast-to-coast) truck drivers. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what they do. They have their \u201ccondo\u201d in the back and live out of that. In fact, truck stops with stores that cater to truck drivers is a good place to pick up things to make such a life easier for a mobile person. Again: figuring out where to park and sleep is the biggest obstacle you face. I would read a lot in my off time. I would join a gym, not only for working out but for showers/hygiene. Preferably of the 24 hour kind. I would have a smart phone and pay for an unlimited data plan. Since I wouldn\u2019t be paying rent, I could probably afford to go to a 2-year college: a great way to spend your off-time and get ahead in something you\u2019re interested in. In this respect, you would probably need a real address for mail. You\u2019ll need one for work in any event. Perhaps you would have a friend who would take mail for you and provide the address even though you don\u2019t live there. I don\u2019t think you could pull that off with a private mailbox company, but maybe. Doing all this means you have a home and transportation. Transportation is a big deal in California because so many things are spread out. We have a \u201ccar culture\u201d out here for a reason. If it sounds like I did something like this - it\u2019s because I did. For a short period of time, I and my son were homeless, and we lived out of my truck and camper for a number of months in the Bay Area. I was able to get work because I could provide a real address and phone number. But I got a lot of hostility from people the moment they knew what I was doing. And it was more obvious with a truck/camper than it would be with a van. I did what I had to do, and eventually got out of those circumstances for the sake of my young son at the time. I took away some valuable lessons from that. Some were ugly lessons about people. And some were how possible it was to do what I was doing if I thought through each of my problems and how to solve them effectively. In summary: It is very hard to live on minimum wage in California in the cities. And work is hard to find in the small towns away from the big cities. One way or another, you will make big compromises to pull it off. But you want not only to exist from day to day but make progress in your life toward some long-term goals. Your life needs to have more meaning than just \u201cliving in California\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it would not be easy, but it is possible. Location will be key. There are many towns and cities in California that are quite affordable, and I\u2019m not just talking about small towns or rural areas. Fresno has one million people and rents there are very affordable. Someone making minimum wage could share an apartment or house with 2 or 3 other people. Mark Cuban, the billionaire, reports that when he was young man just starting out, a bunch of young guys - he says 10 or 12 of them - shared an apartment and just put mattresses on the floor to sleep. Even in a more expensive city, you may be able to rent a room in a house for $500 to $700 per month. With a low income, you might be eligible for benefits like food stamps. There are food pantries everywhere, even in rural areas. When I was just starting out, I shared a house with 2 other people and did not have a car. I rode the bus to work every day. Money was tight, but I survived and slowly worked my way up. ",
