            "answer_text": "Ok, so here are all the things I normally bring to festivals like Coachella. Always make sure you check if what you\u2019re bringing is within the guidelines though. That way you don\u2019t have to leave and come back. Tent/Canopy (I had a big private tent when I went. If you\u2019re not camping there, there\u2019s not point though)ChairsSleeping bagsBattery-powered fan (handheld or big)Batteries to go with said fanRadio or speaker (battery powered for music all day/night if you\u2019re one of those kinds of people)WATER & Ice in a cooler (Some of the bottles I had were frozen and I lined the coolers with them, put ice on top, and put the unfrozen water on it. Layering the cooler last longer) (PS, dry ice lasts the whole weekend and if you wrap it in newspaper and use it to line the cooler, you\u2019d be good. BUT DON\u2019T TOUCH IT WITH BARE HANDS!)Food & Snacks (I had a small grill and hotdogs along with a whole bunch of other snacks, but I was with a group of people)SunscreenPortable charger for phones (I was with friends so I had brought my collection of 10 and a solar-powered charger)EarplugsFace wipesHandsanitizerPortable shower or \u201cshower in a can\u201d (Bath & Body has a shower in a bottle foam that I used for things like this. Not sure if they make it anymore though)Whatever medications you\u2019re supposed to take (I brought Advil and my regular medications in the original bottles)FLASHLIGHTS",

            "answer_text": "What should you bring to Coachella? If you\u2019ve attended music festivals before then just follow most of the same common sense measures that you would for any other event: Dress comfortably \u2013 it gets quite hot during the day and you will be out for nearly 12 hours for three daysGood (comfortable!) shoes \u2013 not only will you be on your feet for most of the day you'd be walking a few miles and dancing a fair bitKeep a cap / hat / something to cover the headSunscreenSunglasses (cheap ones \u2013 it is crowded and you will be moving / dancing so there\u2019s always a probability of losing them)Just to be on the safe side, keep some cold weather gear- it does get chilly in the nightIt has rained in the past in Indio during April, so keep a poncho if you canThere are lockers inside the venue and they\u2019re definitely worth it! Drop off whatever stuff you don\u2019t need to have with you all the time inside and move around with ease. The lockers do sell out so make sure you book one at the earliest Outside food and water is not allowed. However you are allowed to bring in an empty plastic bottle, which you can keep refilling at the water stationsMedicines (with prescriptions)Tissues / wet wipesThe Coachella app is useful \u2013 you can find out the artist schedule / stages on itPortable phone chargerI would have added carrying cash to the list but Coachella is partnering with Square and Apple Pay this year so hopefully cashless transactions will address the need for thatHave fun!
