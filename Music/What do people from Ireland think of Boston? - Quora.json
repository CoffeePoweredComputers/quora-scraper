            "answer_text": "The first few times I visited Boston, I wasn\u2019t a fan. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, maybe something similar to Dublin. I was set back by the aggressive tipping culture, the constant rush, the crazy drivers and the fact that parts of Boston (ie Woburn) were still dry areas. I didn\u2019t necessarily see it as a friendly city, and I quickly realised that the American definition of an \u201cold city\u201d was quite different to the the Irish definition. This was before the Big Dig: a loud ugly metal motorway cutting through the city looked incongruous. But little by little, I came to love Boston. It has many charming gardens and parks and a wonderful arboretum near the centre of town. The humour is very sarcastic and similar to back home - Bostonians get slagging and irony. The museums are great, the aquarium is fantastic and it\u2019s a city with a proper history: Boston is ground zero of the United States after all. The bars and restaurants are good. It\u2019s a student city with real life to it. It has an abundance of lectures, concerts, shows and exhibits to see. And unlike many cities in America, Boston has a proper public transport system. So yeah, Boston. It grows on you. ",

            "answer_text": "What do people from Ireland think of Boston? Nothing in particular I\u2019d reckon - it\u2019s just another city in a foreign country thousands of miles away. Other than folks who\u2019ve been there or have connections there, it\u2019s not exactly a hot topic here - bigger/more famous US cities like NYC or LA would probably be more into the household name status. Plenty of people touristing to the US do visit the place, mind you. ",
