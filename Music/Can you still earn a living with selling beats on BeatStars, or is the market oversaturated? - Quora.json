            "answer_text": "Realistically there is only a small number of people that acutally make a decent amount while the average is barley scraping by. Selling beats online is considered passive income, not something you should rely on as your main source of income. It's not a smart move to quit your day job as there are people out there making those stupid mistakes which is not a stable source of income. You have no control of how much you would make as it\u2019s like a rollercoaster. You could go weeks or months without any sales or make make some here and there. Passive income should only be considered a 2nd source of income as smart people generally have multiple sources of income generally both Active income combined with passive income. So if you are going to sell beats online, I highly advise to have some sort of Active income such as your day job or start your own business or be a freelancer. Get into Recording, Mixing and Mastering. Learn how to network and build relationships with Artists in your local market and get in the studio with that artist and start producing records from top to bottom if you are going to call yourself a Producer.

Your quality of music and skill as a producer are important factors but the saturated market overrides that to a significant degree. ",
