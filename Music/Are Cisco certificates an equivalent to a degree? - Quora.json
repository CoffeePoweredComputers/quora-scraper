            "answer_text": "Absolutely no In degree, you learn various topic. Some are useful in life while others are totally utterly useless. Cisco Certificates is vendor specific and one particular topic. Vendor goes out of business, Cisco Certificate become useless Degree takes 3 to 4 years to earn. Univeristy goes out of business, Degree will still retain its value. Cisco certificate you can get in 1 to 2 days (except CCIE and CCDE). You heard that right. You can cheat through Cisco Certification and get all of them done in 1 day or 2 most providing you have money Degree - you can not cheat through. You have to complete 3 to 4 years. Pass exam (may or may not be useful) Certain management position requires degree. Your Cisco certificate will not help unless you kiss A$$. Degree may shortlist you for management position Certain country - Like India/Bangladesh without Degree, it does not matter how many certificate, you will have tough time. They use Degree as a baseline. While Certificate may be important Degree is a must for certain country in Developed country like US/Canada, Degree is not that important for technical people unless going to management. Most recently one of my student for $60h job just doing CCNA at Bloomberg. You can reat at here VoiceBootcamp Blog Without any sort of Degree. Some culture, you cant even get married if man does not have degree :) you know which culture is that :) Overall Degree is not equivalent to Certificate. Each has its own pros and cons. Long Term Degree helps to climp up the ladder. Short Terms Certificate wins. ",
