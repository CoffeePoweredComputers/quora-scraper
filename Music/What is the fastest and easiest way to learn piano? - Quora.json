            "answer_text": "below is amazing contetn from Oscar Santos 's site: How to Quickly and Easily Learn Piano for Beginners Question: What is the fastest and easiest way to learn piano? If you're learning to play the piano, or if already took some piano classes, there are some tips that may help you. Whenever you feel a little discouraged because you're not evolving fast enough, or if you want to gain more confidence when you're playing, make sure to check the following list: Take a break: When you decided you wanted to learn how to play a piano, you never thought it could be so hard. It's not hard; you just need a break. You need to understand that learning the piano takes a lot of practice and a lot of dedication. And this is how a break may just well be what you need. Just take a couple of hours or even a day away from your piano. You'll notice that it will help you release all your frustration and stress, and when you go back to play again, you'll feel much more refreshed and confident. Play music you like: One of the things that makes most people drop their piano classes is that they just don't like the music they're playing. You enjoy playing the piano; you just don't like the music you're playing. So, why not change it? Even if the music you like doesn't dare your skills, it doesn't matter. You're playing piano because you love to do so. You're having fun. Learn the theory: When you first think about learning piano, you simply assume that you're going to sit on the bench and that you'll start playing immediately. However, and although you might actually sit on the bench and try to play for a while, if you're serious about learning the piano, you need to learn some of the theory as well. It may seem boring - especially when you look at the piano right beside you -, but it can really help you improve your skills. By learning some theory, you'll then be able to play more freely and play a more wide repertoire. Work on scales: In order to learn the 12 key signatures, scales can help you. So, you need to practice scales and make it as a part of your daily routine. This will allow you to become more and more familiar with the piano as well. Don't make it a point to learn all the scales and start playing them perfectly immediately. Instead, you should take the time to improve your accuracy. Take it slow: Take the time to internalize all the steps when you're learning the piano. The first thing you need to do is to learn the music, with all the rhythms and the right notes. And only then you need to develop your technique and muscle memory to play the music well. If you rush things instead of taking some time to learn, you'll end up missing some important points that will translate in later bad habits. Express yourself: Music should act as a way you have to express your emotions. And this is why the best musicians have their own ways to feel the music. And when they do feel it, they share this same feeling with whoever is listening. Much more important that playing the entire music without missing a note is to play it with the heart. ==> Top resource, frree piano training: 701PianoLessonVideos .blogspot .com ",
