            "answer_text": "N.O.I.S.E by Ghostemane. If you want edgy, play this album beginning to end.  The album deals with: Nihilism, S&M, Isolation, Abuse against the self and others, and even has a song about the Columbine Shootings. After Nihil and FLESH gets better! It contains references to dystopic novels and occultism. The last few songs have a Nine Inch Nails vibe to them, especially the industrial metal track The Singularity. The album ends on a haunting, but depressing whimper that's only accompanied by an acoustic guitar. In fact almost all of his work contains references to the occult and other \u201cedgy\u201d topics. I still dig his music, give it a listen! ",

But soft what light, through yonder window breaksIt is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balconyHow romantic No, but seriously, he writes some astounding lyrics. What makes him edgy is the fact that he screams these things at you. And at the start of one of his songs he\u2019s got some porn audio going or something, which is pretty edgy, if you ask me. He sounds like he\u2019s genuinely in pain and it makes that whole statement about puke a lot more poetic. ",
