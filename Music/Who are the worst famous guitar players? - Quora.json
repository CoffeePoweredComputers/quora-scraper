            "answer_text": "As a proficient guitarist myself, that one is easy... at least in the rock genre. 1st place goes to Joan Jett. 2nd place is loaded with names who are probably equally bad. One name I would put in that group is Ace Frehley. In his prime, he was sub mediocre at best. Today his studio work is tolerable but live performances are absolutely awful. There are scads of famous guitarists who after decades of fame, haven\u2019t really progressed beyond their first year or two of playing. It does give beginners hope however in that they serve as aspirational role models. Serious guitarists quickly achieve and surpass these early role models. It is only then when they realize how bad these guitarists really are. They also begin to realize that talent isn\u2019t the pre-requisite to fame they may have initially thought. But who cares really. All that really matters is the music and whether one likes it or not. In this context, virtuosity for the most part is meaningless. ",

            "answer_text": "I saw this chap named Zak Wild, or something like that. He had a good vibrato but was playing simple pentatonic scales as fast as he could muster. Didn\u2019t impress. Saw this other fellow, I think his name was Ed Halen, or similar. He played a bunch of finger tapping and whammy bar dives and theatrics, what I would endearingly class as \u2018guitar wank\u2019 and could not come up with any tasteful melodic moments. Not impressed. Then I saw a guy, I\u2019m sure his name was Eric Crapton, and he just kept playing the same old blues riffs all the time, he was actually quite good, but people were calling him a guitar God. He wasn\u2019t THAT good.. None of them were anything nearly as good as a chap called Richard Keith, in a band called the Rolling Stoned. He sold more records than all the rest of them and couldn\u2019t even tune his guitar properly, in fact, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to get a new \u2018E\u2019 string when he broke it. He was amazing. ",
