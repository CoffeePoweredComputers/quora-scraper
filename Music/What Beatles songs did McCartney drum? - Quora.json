            "answer_text": "Paul played the drums in :  The Ballad of John And Yoko In fact, both George and Ringo weren't present to record this song. It was an impromptu jam between Lennon and McCartney and they ended up recording the whole song Back In The USSR Tensions were high during the White Album. Apparently, Ringo had quit the band by this time. Lennon went on and convinced Ringo to come back. But by the time they came back, Macca had already tracked the drums for Back in the USSR. Apparently, you could cut the tension with a knife. Dear Prudence Features some excellent drumming from Paul. Gotta give it to him, he's a hell of a musician. Honorary mentions: Apparently, Macca also suggested the pattern of drumming of Ticket To Ride ",

            "answer_text": "A few additions and clarifications. Paul did lay down the basic track for Dear Prudence, but Ringo sweetened it with the fills that add much to the track in the last flourish. Paul did indeed play Back in the USSR, but John and George also contributed. Incidentally, this song has my vote for the worst drumming on any Beatles track. The bass drum on Mother Nature's Son is Paul, as is the drumming on Wild Honey Pie. Paul's musical genius is found in the suggestions he made for several of Ringo's great performances: Ticket to Ride, Come Together, and Tomorrow Never Knows. ",
