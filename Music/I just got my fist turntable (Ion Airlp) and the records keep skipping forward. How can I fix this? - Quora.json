            "answer_text": "As a guess, you have not set it up properly. Turntables need to be level and stable, and the stylus (the \u201cpoint\u201d that goes in the record groove) needs to be aligned with some care. Also, the \u201cstylus pressure\u201d (how hard that little point presses on the record) must be set properly \u2014 too little pressure and the stylus can\u2019t stay in the groove, too much and the record will be damaged more than necessary (every time a record is played it experiences some damage). Perhaps the turntable came with a booklet describing the process. ",

            "answer_text": "I would add one thing to the previous answer - \u201cantiskate\u201d. There is normally a method to add some tonearm \u201cpull\u201d towards the center of the record to counteract centrifugal force from the spinning record long story short, check the tracking force (usually 2 grams give or take) and the antiskate setting. Either or both could cause the symptom you are getting. Good luck, enjoy your analog music! ",
