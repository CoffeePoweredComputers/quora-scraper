            "answer_text": "You need a pre-amplifier and then a power amplifier, which are often part of the same unit called an integrated power amplifier, if you wish to use unpowered speakers. A receiver is a type of an integrated power amplifier. A receiver is a power amplifier with ability to receive radio signals. An integrated power amplifier also contains the pre-amplifier stage. It also usually has at least one set of jacks connected to its pre-amplifier function. Those are marked as \u201cphono\u201d, which likely originates from \u201cphonograph\u201d, which is what you would use to properly connect a common turntable and increase its signal to line level voltage. They can also be used for dynamic microphones, which also must pass the pre-amplifier stage to increase the signal to line level. The non-phono jacks are for line level input and skip the pre-amplifier stage. It gets murkier for powered speakers, which contain a built in power amplifier. Some of them also have a pre-amplifier built in. When you attempt to use a power amplifier on very weak signal from a microphone or turntable without passing it through the pre-amplifier stage, you will hear a lot of noise and the volume will be low. So, you do not need a receiver. You do need either a pre-amplifier + powered speakers, such as is the typical DJ mixer setup or an integrated power amplifier capable of accepting phono level signal and passing it through its built in pre-amplifier stage. Most consumers purchase a home theater receiver, which at its heart is an integrated power amplifier that also happens to do more things, but for professional sound and car audio we use dedicated power amplifiers without a built in pre-amplifier. This is, by the way, why car audio uses terms like \u201c3 pre-outs\u201d when describing features of high end equipment. That means the head unit features 3 pairs of RCA outputs that have been pre-amplified and raised to line level. This is different from speaker level output that has been amplified by the built in power amplifier integral to that head unit. To further amplify the speaker level output, which is necessary with older equipment not equipped with pre-outs, we use speaker level adapters. In practical terms, that gives the user ability to amplify each signal pair differently, such as by sending the subwoofer signal to a dedicated subwoofer amplifier. In summary, the turntable signal must be pre-amplified to raise it to line level signal unless the turntable contains a built in pre-amplifier, which is a feature on some DJ turntables. Your older turntable does not have that feature. If your receiver does not have a built in pre-amplifier, you can use a dedicated pre-amplifier or any mixer with pre-amplifier stage. ",

            "answer_text": "You will need a receiver or intergrated amplifier. You need one that has phono inputs. The red and white cables from the turntable you are describing are called RCA leads. The RCA leads from the turntable go into the receiver/amplifier. The receiver/amplifier connects to your speakers with speaker cable. You can pick up some good hifi equipment from ebay. Look out for manufacture\u2019s such as Marantz, Technics. Harman Kardan, Pioneer. You should be able to pick something up for less that $100 2nd hand. Some of the late 80\u2019s early nineties hifi, are good buys. Remember make sure it has phono inputs. ",
