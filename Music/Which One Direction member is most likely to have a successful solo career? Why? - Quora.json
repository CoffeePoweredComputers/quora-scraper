            "answer_text": "That really depends on what you value. The big complicating factor is that multiple members have made decisions that aren\u2019t about maximizing their commercial success but rather doing what they want as artists. None of them are worried about their solo earnings due to the immense success of 1D. But they could change their minds at any minute. Harry had a big hit with Sign of the Times, but not quite as big as Zayn\u2019s hits. The rest of his singles didn\u2019t do much, but promotion was handicapped by the passing of his stepfather. His album sold decently, I believe the best of the bunch by a slight margin over Zayn, but nothing mind-blowing. He has been very successful touring the album, though playing arenas and not the stadiums 1D used to play. Harry has so far chosen to do music with a strong classic rock element that doesn\u2019t sound like much that\u2019s popular right now, and he released a 5+ minute lead that was always going to struggle on radio. He has also taken time to get his foot in the door as an actor, which may pay long-term dividends. Zayn had the big #1 US debut single with Pillowtalk and another global hit with Dusk to Dawn. His first album sold very well. However his recent singles really haven\u2019t done anything and his new album is selling poorly due to his near-total lack of promotion. He\u2019s never toured, currently has no management, and isn\u2019t even releasing videos for his new singles, and he seems to like it that way. At the moment he has a less bright looking future commercially than other members - but of course he could always turn that around if he decided he wanted to start promoting. Niall is the big overachiever in my books. He was one of the two members that barely got any lines back on X-Factor, but he got a hit single with Slow Hands and was able to tour pretty large venues with his album. However I heard the tour struggled a bit. We\u2019ll have to see how the next album does. Niall has chosen to do mellow folky sounding music that again doesn\u2019t sound super commercial or current. Liam got a big global hit with Strip That Down and a couple of other tracks have been minor hits. However he has not gotten an album out let alone touring, and this fall he released a poorly promoted EP that sold poorly. I\u2019m not sure what is next for him. He has an amazing voice but seems to be lacking a firm artistic direction. Louis was never tipped to be the big breakout star and he knew it. He was making moves behind the scenes but decided to release something with the passing of his mother. Scoring a minor hit doing that should be counted as a victory. To be frank I doubt we will ever see a full major label album from Louis, but he still might wind up as the most financially successful member in the long run - those that move behind the scenes often are.

            "answer_text": "THIS IS THE FIRST QUESTION I AM ANSERING SO PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL WHILE SAYING YOUR OPINIONS. I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE ORDER OF THEIR AGES THIS IS NOT MY RANKING OF THEIR SOLO CAREERS. ALSO I MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIASED TOWARDS LOUIS ( SINCE I AM JUST A FAN OF HIM) BUT I WILL TRY NOT TO BE TOO BIASED. THIS IS A VERY LONG ANSWER OKAY LET\u2019S START LOUIS TOMLINSON :- okay louis released his debut album WALLS earlier this year ( which I am super proud of) but it didn\u2019t get enough promotion and didn\u2019t do that well compared to the other members it was #1 in 54 countries when it released but then it kind of became forgotten but suddenly after 8 months it topped the charts again ( surprising right ) it was #1 in 20 countries and in the top 10 worldwide and he literally created history by being #1 in the charts twice . but even after all that he is incredibly underrated but he is finally being known by a lot of people. I can see him being very successful in the future and being known for his amazing songwriting skills ( a close second to queen Taylor though ). at present he is the 4th or 3rd most successful member of all the members.ZAYN MALIK :- Zayn started off as being the most successful member with having his debut single PILLOWTALK hit #1 on bbhot 100 and also have his album MIND OF MINE hit #1 on the bbtop 200 he also has hit over 1 billion views for PILLOWTALK and DUSK TILL DAWN he also has the most number of subscribers in YouTube out of all the members. but ICARUS FALLS didn\u2019t do very well compared to the previous album due to zero promotion and his previous singles like SATISFATION and SOUR DIESEL barely got 10 million views. but he recently came back with a new single called BETTER which is doing very well in charts. At present he is the 3rd or 2nd most successful member ( louis is coming very close to him ) out of one directionLIAM PAYNE :- I actually liked Liam a lot when he was in the band but his solo music is the least pleasing to me I heard a few songs from his album LP1 but most of the songs there were very outdated his genre is very similar to Zayn but Zayn has a very mature writing style while this album has such a childish I really expected Liam to write the songs since he wrote really good songs back in the band. other than that he released MIDNIGHT with Alesso which was really good i wish that in the future Liam will make music which would showcase his amazing vocal range. At present he is the 5th most successful member of one direction. on a good note his LP SHOWS have sold out over 40k tickets per show and strip that down has over 1 billion streams in all platforms.NIALL HORAN :- to be honest I didn\u2019t expect big things from Niall but he absolutely blew my mind THIS TOWN was so romantic and laidback and his debut album FLICKER topped the charts this boy was definitely underrated in the band but he definitely isn\u2019t underrated as a solo artist his songs are very popular and he is definitely very stable as a solo artist. I personally don\u2019t listen much of his music but yeah his genre is definitely a people pleaser. At present he is the 2nd or the 3rd most successful member of one direction.HARRY STYLES :- well at this point this is a FACT that Harry is one of the most successful artists out there his sophomore album FINE LINE literally broke records and he also got his #1 on bbhot 100 with WATERMELON SUGAR there isn\u2019t a single kid who doesn\u2019t have a crush on Harry and there literally isn\u2019t a single day I haven\u2019t heard watermelon sugar ( I am high key sick of it LMAO ) he is literally making history out there. he is even considered as the to contenders for Grammy awards this year and might even win. At present he is the most successful member of one direction.I AM SORRY THAT THIS ANSWER TURNED OUT TO BE TOO LONG. COMMENT YOUR OPINIONS ",
