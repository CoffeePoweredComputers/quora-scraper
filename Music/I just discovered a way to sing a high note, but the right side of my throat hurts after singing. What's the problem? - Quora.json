            "answer_text": "If anything in your throat hurts from singing, you sure as hell are doing something VERY wrong! It is hard to tell from a \u201cdisembodied\u201d medium such as Quora (meaning not in-person/live), but I suspect that the discomfort in your throat is the result of asking too much of it whilst asking too little from the rest of your voice, particularly the supporting apparatus, the breath and breathing mechanisms. Pain in the \u201cthroat\u201d most often means the larynx, where the vocal folds (cords) are, but can also mean the muscles in the neck surrounding. Neither is acceptable! Most likely, you are pushing your \u201cthroat\u201d (as described above) to do all of the work, and do it \u201coff the breath,\u201d which is to say without proper - perhaps any - breath support. That being said, you need to learn to sing \u201con the breath,\u201d which isn\u2019t nearly so daunting as it may sound. It\u2019s a discipline, one which is readily taught and learned, and also essential to not only singing, but also speaking. A good, basic teacher of voice can teach you how to do this. But you really can\u2019t learn how to do it on-line. Period. It requires live interaction. If we think that Renee Fleming or Lady Gaga or Pavarotti or Josh Groban (those are just the names that popped to mind while waiting for my coffee to finish!) make those sounds entirely with their throat, we are operating with some serious misinformation! Good singing - and I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s opera, rock or anything in between or betwixt - involves the entire body and mind in the process. If it is a passion, it is worth finding a really good teacher and learning the classic, essential basics of singing, of properly functioning vocal production. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of music you ultimately wish to sing: a singer must have a strong basic vocal technique. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are a few possibilities: You may not be providing adequate support. One thing I always check in my own singing, and certainly in that of my students, is muscle tension in the throat resulting from inadequate breath support. Proper air supply and appoggio (breath prop) is necessary to relaxed, strong singing higher noted.You may have a technique flaw that creates tension. Does your singing have vibrato? My go-to singing \u201cmaxim\u201d in this: \u201cVibrato is the natural, inevitable result of relaxed, supported singing. When the vibrato goes, it\u2019s usually a result of absence of one or both conditions.\u201d If you\u2019re fatiguing because of lack of support, your vibrato (or lack thereof) could be an indicator.You may not have good posture. Look, there\u2019s always tension somewhere in the body. Usually we learn to make use of it in constructive ways\u2014for instance, tension in the hips both helps us stand upright and provide good foundation upon which to produce appoggio. But it\u2019s not unheard of to climb up the spinal column and wreak havoc with singing.You may just be singing literature that\u2019s too high.\u201d No one wants to be told they\u2019re in the wrong literature, but it\u2019s something to consider. Just because you have high notes does not necessarily mean you\u2019re vocally fit to sing a ton of them. It\u2019s not unheard of for mezzo sopranos to have the same range as a regular soprano, but that doesn\u2019t mean the range is equally comfortable. Similarly, I\u2019ve sung with baritones with enormous ranges, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be easy singing tenor literature. Having high notes doesn\u2019t always mean you have a higher voice. How long can you live among those notes?If you\u2019re not studying with a live voice teacher, I encourage you to search one out. Sometimes it takes an external set of ears and a candid, knowledgeable authority to give best guidance. If you are studying with a teacher, ask about working on relaxing warmup techniques. ",
