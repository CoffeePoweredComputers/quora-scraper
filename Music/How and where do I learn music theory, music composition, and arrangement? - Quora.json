            "answer_text": "The Six Stages of a Song by Ask Simply Mary Stream on Anchor.fm So you want to make music, but where do you start? August 3, 2020| Visit the blog for video! Ask Simply Mary Podcast, Music Production, Musicians At 14 years old, Jalyn Fisher has a strong interest in ALL things music, but where does she even begin to start when there are so many different things to learn and so many changes in this fast paced industry? Today on Ask Simply Mary I would like to give Jalyn a plan of action to learn all the things she is dying to know about making music. We will be covering the 6 stages of Music Production that are critical to creating a good song. The great thing about this, is that each step has a future with positions and jobs in the industry somewhere. Do not fall into thinking you need to know it ALL, let me reassure you that you don't. Don't get me wrong, the more you know the better, but be realistic with your direction, you will grow along with your education and that does take time. Eventually you will be educated in all the areas you will need to be. Below you will be able to study any process you would like to go over through Wikipedia by clicking on the words highlighted in blue. Don't forget to use your Google skills and find some suitable videos on YouTube, or other Social Media forums to place yourself among some of the musicians you most aspire to be like. You are not a copy cat but you can benefit greatly learning from others. *Don't forget to share with others later too ;) Get yourself around people who are working in the Music Industry, if you put yourself around like minded individuals you will find the most growth. Also, don't forget to join your high school marching band, concert band or show choir! Trust me, you WILL USE THAT KNOWLEDGE LATER. IT IS PRICELESS! Also look around your local area for different Centers for the Arts and organizations you can start to become a part of right now, in some way, shape or form. You will have more connections to people who are interested in the same things. Don't let stigmas and such petty things distract you from the big prize here. Some people won't join band in high school or they end up missing other opportunities because of what others may think. Don't let anything like this hold you back. This is the future YOU are interested in, so you need to seek out every experience that you can to be sure that you know this is what you want to do. After all, even the time you are putting into things now is an investment, you are literally investing in yourself here. So I would love to see you make good investments without missing out on anything. With all that said, let's get going on the podcast where I will elaborate some more on each important step that you will be using to make music. The 6 Stages of a Song Songwriting Lyrics, composition and song structure basics. Arranging Harmonizing, creating melodies, phrasing. Tracking (Digital) Sound Recording, DAW, Analog Recording Editing Audio Engineer, microphone's and other audio equipment. Mixing Mono, Stereo, Surround Sound Mastering I am so excited to have laid all of this out for you Jalyn, I know that so many people will benefit from all of the work they put into practice once they learn this critical information. Remember: Don't overwhelm yourself, there is so much to learn. Take one day at a time and one step at a time. You can't learn everything at once so try to get a good footing before you move on to learn more. Sometimes you can frustrate yourself with too much at one time and end up walking away so don't give up. If it feels like what you are learning is too overwhelming, just let it breathe and come back to that later. Persistence wins the day! PRO Organizations Finally, here is the information mentioned near the end of the show today. Check out The ASCAP Experience here! Also, look into other options like BMI here. I have so much hope for you, Best Wishes Always! Mary Musician & Ask Simply Mary Podcast Host ",

            "answer_text": "Theory: from the internet - This is your best and quickest source to get started at least. Read articles found in generalized searches and other articles they lead to. Do \u201cdeep dive\u201d drill-downs on topics that are of particular interest to you, or when you read something that confuses you. Everything you read will uncover something else you don\u2019t understand or want to learn more about. When you \u201cget serious\u201d about topics that you can\u2019t get enough specific detail about from Wikipedia articles and obscure web sites found by internet searches, look into books and courses you can take. Don\u2019t rely on peers in informal, face-to-face jam sessions, or casual conversation, to learn your music theory. Often, people you talk to haven\u2019t ever studied theory and don\u2019t know what they are talking about, even if they are accomplished musicians. If they are knowledgeable, their answers will be truncated and incomplete at best, if not dismissive. When pressed for detail in conversation, they tend to snap at you with something like, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for me to explain all of music theory to you.\u201d They are right. It\u2019s a deep topic and you have to put in some serious time studying it to get anywhere. This is why it\u2019s best to use the internet to \u201cshop\u201d for what you want to learn about before investing in books or tutelage.Composition: from books and academic courses - Anyone can write songs, and a lot of people do as soon as they learn how to make music. Most of these are terrible, though, because the songwriters were oblivious to the mathematical and cultural principles of various music forms. This is the kind of knowledge that you have to spend years studying, perhaps even take a college degree, before you know much that is useful. Serious study must be combined with sufficient performance skills and ear training in both singing and playing instruments like the piano or guitar that allow one to sing while playing. Performance skills are important because they allow a composer/musician to instinctively understand what they are learning about, as well as to put that knowledge to use with their own compositions.Arrangement: from study and practice - Like composition, arranging is a technical skill that can learned in an academic environment. However, there is a large amount of experiential acumen necessary to achieve professional results. In other words, you have to do it a lot before you get any good at it, but you can usually get there quicker if you know what you are doing. There are arrangers with no academic training who learned solely by doing, as well as arrangers who have advanced degrees in music. Both kinds of arrangers achieved what they did by developing their natural talent in practicing their craft.Bottom line: Do the work and pay your dues!",

            "answer_text": "The world has changed quite a bit since I was young and a musician there are three phrases you used music theory music composition and I thought I saw two different terms for the third item music production and also arrangement these words, at least for me hold context music production is the newest most modern phrase - it is the one I know next to nothing about . that is , unless you mean music production in an older context - minus the modern contexts of Eg Ableton Pro Tools 21 st music today music production refers to this modern side of the vast music world ( vast , meaning Bach to Katy Perry !) this modern world of producing music has little to do with the other two terms you asked about. music theory and Music Composition those terms are associated with eras that seem mostly forgotten Beethoven dealt with Composition and theory one more term you used ( there were two questions - and one of them had this term. Arrangement Arrangement is an older term from a previous era - back in the mid 20th Century , just prior to synthesizers and computer driven music , there existed an elite group of musicians who could arrange music for a band or orchestra .. they had titles. Arrangers! They were paid to Arrange a preexisting music Composition a common example is Christmas songs A professional arranger ( who also was known to pay a Copyist - who wrote the individual parts of the Arrangers Arrangement ) would write a special version of famous songs . Since the arranger was well paid \u2026 the person hiring arranger had to be a singer or bandleader who could afford to pay for this special music Therefore a successful singer or bandleader. Frank Sinatra comes to mind . He hired the most talented Arrangers Arrangers had professional copyists who would be responsible for getting the \u201ccharts \u201c to the studio , where the musicians would read the music. Quite a chain of events ! arrangers are very few these days and I have always held them in high esteem for their knowledge of music an arranger has to have knowledge of the instruments in the orchestra - writing for strings always impressed me. here are some of the best arrangers from a bygone era Claus Ogerman Neil Hefti Sammy Nestico Nelson Riddle Johnny Mandel Don Costa Marty Paich Leroy Anderson composed and arranged I\u2019m less familiar with the classical world but that world had very adept writers and arrangers as well the classical world and the world of movies came together because movies had music that used orchestras I used to work for an arranger and he was from Brazil . He told me ( 50\u201360 years ago ) he studied a correspondence course from Berklee School of music. none of these interests are readily available \u2026 you have to persevere in your search for music knowledge Adam Neely seems like a knowledgeable source as well as Berklee ",

            "answer_text": "Learn to play the piano. While you\u2019re learning, know all you can about the theory underlying the music. In my case I had a great teacher (my father) who made sure I understood the music I was playing. Play the piano from sheet music, note for note as written. Also play the piano by ear and from chord charts. You may not end up learning these various approaches from the same teacher.Play in groups with others. You may do this as a pianist, or as a player on another instrument.Create your own music. If you aren\u2019t sure your creations are that good keep doing it anyway. They will get better and better the more you do it. Write for people who will play what you\u2019ve written so that you can tell how it sounds, and how it works for real players.Get several different kinds of music software. Categories I see as important are software for recording, notation and improvisation. My favorites are Sibelius for notation, Garage Band for recording and Band in a Box for improvisation.If you expect to learn all of this on your own without teachers, have a serious talk with yourself, and figure out how deep your commitment really goes. To understand theory, and to be great at composing and arranging, you have to really want to do it. If you really want to do it, you\u2019ll find a way, and it will bring you great joy!!!",

            "answer_text": "By getting yourself an accredited teacher. As regards composition, most composers begin by writing music for the instrument or instruments they play. Harmonic instruments such as guitar or piano are vital tools to build harmonic awareness, unless your aspiration is simply to compose singable melodies. I\u2019ve never forgotten what my composition professor once said to me, however. Apparently he got a number of people who used to contact him who said: \u201cI want to be a composer\u201d. A few pertinent questions quickly revealed that they could neither read nor write music. Nor could they play any instrument. If you qualify to enter any of these categories as an aspirant, then there are prior steps that need to be activated before you can fulfil any compositional ambitions. Good luck. ",

But there is something about structured learning. So while you can try learning all those things on your own, the huge benefit of studying at a university or through a serious online program is that you have instructor interaction, graded exercises, assignments that constantly keep you engaged in the study process. Berklee has a great online school that is fitting with the current weird times in the world. They offer degrees, certificates, or individual courses in all those areas. I am sure there are other great online programs as well, that are more cost effective. Definitely no shortage of avenues for studying those areas, so start figuring out the how and where part, since that comes down to preferences. ",
