            "answer_text": "I think it was about a lot more than money . Also you have to look at it in the era and time in which it happened ,(4 million dollars was nothing to sneeze at) , and the circumstances that came into play . When a band performs and gets paid , it looks like they have it made . However , there are many others holding out their hands as well . The bands manager , if they have an attorney on retainer for legal issues that can and do come up . then there is the road crew who sets up the stage and make sure all the equipment is working properly , the accountant who makes sure the taxes are paid so the IRS doesn\u2019t come in and ceases all your property and valuables because the taxes didn\u2019t get paid . The list goes on and on . That sill doesn\u2019t take into account the money spent in their private lives like their mortgage , the family , and all the finances that goes with that . It all adds up , and is probably more costly than we know . On the other side , I think that the guys in the band were hurt that Freddie was doing an album , and they weren\u2019t included . I mean look at the scene in Bohemian Rhapsody . Do you remember the words said , as well as the looks on their faces ? They were hurt . They saw it as all for one , and one for all , and well Freddie of his own fruition , as well as being influenced by a few others at the time , wasn\u2019t really thinking of it in the same way the other bane members were . One more thing I think played into it also . Freddie looked around . He saw his band mates and they had family . money , fame , the total package . He had Mary whom he loved dearly, but even she had moved on in a way and had started a family of her own . Freddie had all of the same things they did, with one exception , family . He had others around , but some of them were self serving , so the more Freddie had , the more they thought they would have also . Then there was the media and how the scrutinized Freddie . They placed him under a microscope , and parts of his life he had to hide because back in the day ? Some things when found out were career suicide , and that hurt Freddie deeply . He didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone , but imagine seeing others who had that, and you were being denied simply because your personal preferences were not something that was socially acceptable . So take all of the above , roll it into one big ball , and the outcome is what you saw on screen . The glamours lives that we think Artist live , is not as simple as its seems . There is always someone holding their hands out . Its like the saying goes . The more money you make , the more it seems to take . So I don\u2019t think it was just as simple as money , but nothing ever is . ",

            "answer_text": " Hello, Rick! I have learned that the movie does not portray some events accurately, and as I have not yet seen the movie, I had to do some fact-checking with the help of Google: Freddie wasn\u2019t the first to go solo. \u201cDespite what a dramatic scene in Bohemian Rhapsody may tell you, Mercury\u2019s decision to pursue a solo career was not out of spite for his fellow bandmates. Queen drummer Roger Taylor actually went solo first, releasing his 1981 album Fun in Space before Mercury even signed his record deal. After the commercial and critical disappointment that was Queen\u2019s Hot Space, combined with exhaustion from their constant touring, the band collectively decided to take a break where they could pursue different avenues of music.\u201d 5 Things You Didn't Know About Freddie Mercury's Solo Career The group never split up.\u201cThe movie veers the furthest from reality in the build-up to their 1985 performance at Live Aid. There\u2019s a dramatic scene where Freddie reveals that he\u2019s signed a solo deal behind their back for $4 million and that he wants to take a long break from the band. The others are absolutely livid and they all go their separate ways. The truth is that everyone in the band was burned out in 1983 after being on the road for a solid decade. They all wanted a break. The movie makes it seem like they didn\u2019t speak to Freddie for years, but they actually began work on The Works in late 1983 and were never estranged.\u201d Fact-Checking the Queen Biopic, \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 This is a movie that strictly holds to a PG-13 rating and so did not delve deeply into the gay bar scene and the events that led to Freddie\u2019s becoming HIV-positive. Some aspects of the film were more dramatized, some draw the viewer to misleading conclusions and events were not always placed in the correct chronological order. This scene, based on what I have read, was blown out of proportion for dramatic effect and gives the wrong impression of events. It\u2019s a movie I still plan on viewing. ",
