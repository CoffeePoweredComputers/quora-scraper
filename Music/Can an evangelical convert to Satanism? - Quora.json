            "answer_text": "Yet another \u201cCan X convert to Satanism\u201d type question. They all have the same answer, regardless of what X is: Yes. If the person wants to convert there is nothing to stop them from doing so. Converting from a religion requires losing faith in that religions teachings/beliefs, and converting to a religion generally entails at least a certain amount of knowledge of what that religion\u2019s central teachings/beliefs are and subscribing to them, which for most branches of Satanism really just involves a lot of reading and learning about what Satanism actually is, because there\u2019s no formal requirement for membership past the person\u2019s own will. More directly though, one of my partners is an ex-Evangelical who has read my collection of books and answers here on Quora about Satanism and freely admits he really knew nothing about real Satanism and it sounds more reasonable to him than what he was believing.

Sure.. you can accept Satan as your God. but you never knew Jesus to begin with\u2026 maybe you were an evangelical\u2026 And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.\u2014 1 John 5:11-12 ",
