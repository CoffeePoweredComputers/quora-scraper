They sell albums, cds and calendars of many Kpop groups and idols and stationary but the price is a bit pricey, in Facebook if you search \u201cKpop uae or Dubai\u201d some stores can come up sell lightsticks and albums and collectibles that around a little more cheaper than merch in Global Village and in souq you can buy Kpop merchandise but not light sticks and cds or albums if they sell ligh t- sticks by any chance they are most likely fake and the albums and cds.

            "answer_text": "Hello there! Well, I have been living in Dubai for 11 years already. If you want to buy merchandise, my first recommendation is Global Village. I bought A LOOOOT of merchandise there, be careful though as some of them are fake. The choices range from Lightsticks to Albums to Photocard to Postcards to Posters, even T-shirts and accessories! Another one would be this shop somewhere in Sahara Mall (near Sharjah or is it in Sharjah). The prices there are too much though, I would rather stick with Global Village. There\u2019s also some shops in Karama where in they sell Hats, (my friend bought me an EXO hat for my birthday, she told me it was somewhere in Karama). Well, good luck though! It\u2019s tough finding good merchandise, especially here in UAE. ",
