            "answer_text": "According to western standards maybe but for me yes. I personally think Jennie is 3000 times prettier than Cardi B. No hate but it's a pure opinion. . . So why is Jennie better than Cardi B?? Let's find out leaving the visuals aside . . . Jennie   Jennie is classy, cute ,badass yet elegant. She wears appropriate clothes. . . .  . . She might look cute but once she starts rapping it makes ur wig fly to space. . . . Cardi B  . . To be true I don't like the way she dresses and curses everytime (most of the time). It looks as if she is promoting sex. . .  . . I agree she has great rapping skills but her skills should be used to promote sth informative rather than talking all about sexual things.Rather than inspiring women, she is sexualizing them even more which has created negative impact on girls. . . . So yeah Jennie is prettier and is more matured enough to keep her personal things personal.. . . .  ",
