            "answer_text": "Influential wise, i would say Teresa Teng, she is not the best considering her singer ability, but shes still extreamly good as singing don\u2019t get me wrong, you can\u2019t hear her breath at all and she also holds 3 octaves. Her pronounciation is what makes her so good though. Her music is extreamly popular in the mandaring speaking areas. People in the chinese mainland loved her, she\u2019s probably the most well known artist in China, all generations of chinese knows her. People used to say they listen to lao deng at the morning(Deng xiao ping) while listen to xiao deng(teresa at night), and now people say where ever there is chinese people, teresas music also there. Her songs are often played in chinese resturant or chinese related shops. Shes also extreamly popular in Taiwan, HK, Singapore.And her biggest market outside of China is probably Japan, no other chinese artist is as huge as her in Japan. When her career was the biggest in Japan, racisim against chinese were also huge. But she succeded to get pass that. She won massive amount of prices and even participated in the red white singing battle in Japan 3 times. Some Japanese shows even made her performe with VR technology.And shes also famous in Thailand, Korea and pretty much all countries of southern asia. And her song \u6708\u4eae\u4ee3\u8868\u6211\u7684\u5fc3 the moon represent my heart is way too famous in china. It is way too famous, arguebly the second most famous song in china(behind the national anthem of course) And ngl, i don\u2019t remenber all the words of the anthem but i remenber everything of the moon represent my heart. She also got some other famous songs like \u751c\u871c\u871c\uff0c\u5728\u6c34\u4e00\u65b9\uff0c\u4f46\u613f\u4eba\u957f\u4e45\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u5728\u4e4e\u4f60\uff0c\u6f2b\u6b65\u4eba\u751f\u8def and much more.

Resume From Wikipedia. Gackt Camui (\u795e\u5a01 \u697d\u6597 Kamui Gakuto, born July 4, 1973), [nb 1] [3] better known by his stage name Gackt, is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter and actor. He has been active since 1993, first as the frontman of the short-lived independent band Cains:Feel, and then for the now defunct visual kei rock band Malice Mizer, before starting his solo career in 1999. He has released nine studio albums and, with forty-eight singles released, holds the male soloist record for most top ten consecutive singles in Japanese music history. Besides being established in the modern entertainment industry, his music has been used as theme songs for video games (Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII), anime films (Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam) and television series. In addition to his music career Gackt has acted in a few films, including a film he wrote, Moon Child, and his international debut Bunraku, and TV series such as the NHK drama F\u016brin Kazan. He also performed live in theatre stage plays, one of which was written, composed and directed by him: Moon Saga - Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II. Gackt's musical education began at age three when his parents initiated his classical piano education. He grew tired of the piano at age seven when he entered elementary school, and because of moving had to change teachers. [6] It would take another four years until his parents allowed him to quit lessons. Since his father played the trumpet, Gackt was also familiar with brass instruments. He has credited the classical pianist and composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin with being \"the one who taught me the beauty, depth, fun, sadness, the kindness of music; that music could grant people courage, and the meaning of the layers of sound. It isn't an exaggeration to say Chopin is the foundation of my music\". Gackt discography - Wikipedia here you can read maybe the most well writen translation to some of his works.
