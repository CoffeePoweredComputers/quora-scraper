            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t. Under U.S. copyright law (Title 17 U.S. Code), it\u2019s illegal to distribute copyrighted content for which you\u2019re not the intellectual property rights owner. It is also strictly prohibited by YouTube since it\u2019s a violation of their Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Whether you monetize is irrelevant (under Google\u2019s AdSense policies, monetizing content that doesn\u2019t belong to you is also a violation of their TOS, but even if you don\u2019t monetize, it\u2019s still illegal to distribute content that isn\u2019t yours unless you have the owner\u2019s permission. Simply put, it\u2019s theft of someone else\u2019s intellectual property\u2026whether you make money off of it or not. When copyrighted content is found in your YouTube video through their ContentID system, it will automatically flag it and send you a \u201cmatched content notification\u201d and apply whatever remedy the content owner has specified: The rights owner can choose to (1) strip the infringing audio, (2) block the video altogether, or (3) monetize it (by running adds on it or providing a link to purchase the music).[1] The rights owner is also notified of the violation and the action taken, and they have the option to submit a formal takedown notice under the D.M.C.A., which will result in a copyright strike on your acccount (three strikes and your account is terminated).[2] [3] Instead of stealing others\u2019 copyrighted music, you should either: Obtain permission or negotiate a license for use of the music (typically you would work through a rights management company like ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC for this).Use music that\u2019s offered through a Creative Commons license (it\u2019s technically copyrighted but the CC licenses it for such use as long as you follow the terms of the license).Use soundtracks from YouTube\u2019s Audio Library of permitted copyright-free music.Use soundtracks from one of the YouTube channels which specializes in providing copyright-free music (such as Audio Library \u2013 No Copyright Music or Music for creators).Alternatively, you can look up the music policies for that artist and song on YouTube to see in advance how they typically handle infringements. Note, however, that just because they say it\u2019s allowed and they\u2019ll monetize does NOT necessarily mean it\u2019s OK (it\u2019s still copyright infringement and it\u2019s still illegal), but it means they\u2019ve decided for now that it isn\u2019t worth it to pursue violations in court and would rather just monetize your use. Keep in mind, however, that since you\u2019re knowingly using their content without their permission, the rights owner can rescind that allowance at any time (which is particularly likely if your video becomes popular, goes viral, gets publicity, reflects poorly on them, or otherwise becomes an issue).

            "answer_text": "In general, whether you\u2019re monetizing or not doesn't matter: If the music isn't licensed for use in your video you shouldn't use it. Same goes for images, sound effects, fonts etc. Having said that, YouTube has a handy-dandy \u2018music policies\u2019 tool [1]where you can search for copyrighted music and see the policies that are in place for said music. Here you can see whether you can use the music, and if you can, under what conditions. The policies typically look like this: If you use this songPlaybackViewable worldwide MonetizationYou can't monetize your video If you include a song with these policies in your video, everyone can see it but you won\u2019t be able to monetize it. (Pretty straightforward) But also, ads may also be placed on the video by the owner of the music. Some songs will look like this: If you use this songPlaybackViewable everywhere except Germany MonetizationYou can't monetize your video There\u2019s a licensing organisation in Germany called GEMA that has a strong say in what can and can\u2019t be played in their region. It\u2019s the reason that German viewers can\u2019t watch YouTube livestreams; you could unexpectedly start jammin\u2019 to some copyrighted music mid-livestream. Though this may not be of any concern to you if you don\u2019t have a German audience. Other songs will look like this: This song is not available for use in your YouTube videos. If you use this song, your video may be blocked or muted. Clear and to the point.Without getting in contact with the music label and licensing the song - using this song in your video would result in some lackluster silence in your videos. This policy will often apply to newly-released songs and the policy may change later down the line. tl;drOnly if it is in the YouTube music policies and it states that it can be used.
