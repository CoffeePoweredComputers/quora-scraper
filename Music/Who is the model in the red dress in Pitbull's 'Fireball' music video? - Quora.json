The video shows people dancing in black and white, and people firebreathing, along with Marbles, Baker, and Furlan dancing by Pitbull. Pitbull sees a woman (Alejandra Espinoza) coming down stairs and, when she enters the main room, the video turns to color. The woman looks very much likeJessica Rabbit. Many men (usually with women) stare at her. She walks over to Pitbull; they go to a dressing room and passionately make out. The video then ends with Pitbull and the girl leaving the club in his car.\u201d",
