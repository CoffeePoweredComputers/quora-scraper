            "answer_text": "As a citizen of the US I\u2019d say jazz. The musical form was invented here and Americans have largely lost interest in it. A virtuoso like McCoy Tyner can sell out a thousand seat house in a city like Atlanta. But that\u2019s about it. In Europe he can draw thirty thousand or more. That\u2019s kinda sad. The tradition of great players coming from the inner cities seems to be at an end. Part of the reason for that is cuts in education and the elimination of music programs in many public schools. Another part of it all is that today music fans are drawn to songs that have familiar elements. Anything challenging is avoided. Most critics agree that top 40 music last year was pretty boring. I\u2019ve heard many point out that the songs all sounded pretty much the same. But fans are willing to accept that. That too is kinda sad. There are masters of various instruments in numerous genres and a bunch of them can be found in jazz. But here in the States no one is listening to them. Well, very few anyway. We are ignoring one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. And it\u2019s an American invention. ",

            "answer_text": "Neo-classical metal. Pretty much the entire genre is centered around guitar playing, which may be the reason why it\u2019s so underappreciated. But in my opinion, guitar is essential for any genre of music, and works best for this one. It takes the original and fast styles of classical music, while combining them with modern rock and metal. Most people aren\u2019t into instrumental songs, which is quite a shame. They miss out on the fun and enjoyable sounds of just pure playing. Neo-classical metal is just about always instrumental, which gives the genre so much freedom and energy, able to accomplish anything without a voice getting in the way. Songs of these can be fast and energetic, or even cool and calm, but in general, they all sound fantastic. This genre also takes the most skill to be able to play. The guitarists are certainly the most technically skilled you can get. They play fast which takes a lot of experience to be able to do. Anyone can learn to play blues or classic rock scales if they tried, but advanced players are usually the only ones who can do lightning fast arpeggios. The thing that bothers me the most though, is that these guitarists are often judged for just making noise or not putting emotion into songs, which is completely untrue. Yngwie Malmsteen, for example, was criticized terribly by the music community. In reality however, he can give his songs feeling, and play slow at times, even if he is known for his insane shredding. In conclusion, neo-classical metal is the most underrated. It takes lots of skill to learn, sounds the best, and is very free, leaving room for an artist\u2019s lust for creativity. Some of my favorites of these artists are Yngwie Malmsteen, Michael Angelo Batio, and Vinnie Moore.    ",
