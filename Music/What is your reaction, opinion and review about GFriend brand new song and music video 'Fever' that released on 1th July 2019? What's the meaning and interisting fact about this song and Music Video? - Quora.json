            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a new Buddy and FEVER SEASON is my first comeback with Gfriend. Honestly, if we all look back to their past music styles, we can all say that this is UPGRADED, yup, for me, it\u2019s not really a change since I can still see and feel the gfriend vibe I came to like. But the notable mention about this new concept was everything is UPGRADED. First, the teasers were all that\u2019s in it to keep every BUDDY and possibly even those who are plainly liking k-pop, anticipating. Even I myself felt so overhype by this comeback, and honestly, It\u2019s all worth the wait. The concept is not the only thing that\u2019s UPGRADED, but so is their VISUALS, honestly do we even need to talk about how gorgeous they are?? I was honestly stunned by all of them, especially Yuju, her new hairstyle, and the pants dude~ I mean she just killed the whole concept with her aura, yeah, her expression there was just so\u2026 sjkshfrhfkjsn... I don\u2019t even know what to say. Also, Umji, I\u2019m pretty much sure everyone agrees that this cutie pie gives cause us a lot UWUs with every comeback, and in this one, she showed a whole different side. And boy oh boy, did I have a heart attack. SinB is still kicking with her visuals, and eyes (Yeah I could die by them), and her swag just really cause me a heart attack. I like how she dyed her hair green, the color suits her a lot, possibly because of the pair contacts, but it helped a whole lot to emphasize her beauty and the clothes she wore on that one. Sowon is as expected, the definition of Beautiful. Like, guys! Her visuals!! Have u seen her?! Tho Blonde Sowon is undeniably the best, I can\u2019t help but love her brown hair. I think it complimented a lot with the summer theme. And honestly, her whole individuality is the go for. I must say, she suits the Summer theme well. Eunha, Eunha, Eunha. Of course, our mental maknae still SHOOK the heck out of me (okay, that\u2019s exaggerating but meh) she\u2019s undeniably cute even with a more mature expression. she also fits her outfits well, well, I\u2019m no fashionista so\u2026 bye! Last but not least, Yerin, Probably because she\u2019s my first bias (not anymore cause the 6 of them really destroyed the whole meaning of it, I stan OT6) but her appearance SHOOK me hard, like have you guys seen her facial expressions there?? It\u2019s everything. But before I go on and on about the visual, I would like to talk about the music. I\u2019m no expert, but their song is definitely my style. I always loved music that has deep definitions on it, probably because I stan IU whose music never fails to tug a string in my heart. I must say that all gfriend songs are like that, but I think I\u2019m going to ENJOY this new album more. First, the vocal techniques they use were definitely new from them, but I like how they fit with those vocal techniques. but I can\u2019t really go on to much more details, since like I said, I\u2019m no expert. But I think I\u2019m going to enjoy this more, because of how addictive the song was. Okay, okay, all of their songs can be addictive, but this one for me is special. I only know quite a handful of buddies, some of them were multifandom and most of them like songs that are addictive and have that \u2018dance vibe\u2019 in it. I\u2019m not saying that their past few songs weren\u2019t, but the way they focused more on individual swags and charms really helped a lot. And I must say, that even if I\u2019m not a dancer myself, I can\u2019t help but groove with the song even though it\u2019s weird as heck. Overall, I think FEVER is definitely worth a listen, and gfriend is worth stan. They\u2019re a good group with great individual charms but works wonders as a group. Which I really like. ",
