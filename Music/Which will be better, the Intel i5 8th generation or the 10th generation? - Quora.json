            "answer_text": "10th gen is better but not much.There are two variants of 10 th gen ,10nm vs 14nm.10 nm 10th gen is good where as 14nm 10th gen is simply a refined and overclocked 8th gen(actually refined 5th gen lol,but 8th gen doubled core count,so 8th is good). If you find a 10nm 10 th gen you can buy it.I won't recommend 14nm 10 th gen unless it's price is just little over 8th or you need the extra features that 10th gen or the laptop with 10th gen like thunderbolt port. You can find the die size by searching the procesor name in google ",

            "answer_text": "A simpler way to choose is to see the price. Intel chips are always priced unless time and competition comes along. i5 9400f is the cheapest i5 now, (it has 9MB cache with 6 cores, the 9500 and 9600,9600K has the same cache so I m gonna stick with it), so if you buy one, it won't cape you loss. Buying 10th gen i5 is now a loss, as the price will be high. If you are in the budget but want a better processor, i5 10th gen is a worse idea. Even not recommending AMD, 9th gen i5 is the best. Else you can go for AMD R5 2600, 3500, 3600(more pricier, but they do have better performance. But I don't think you will be even needing that). ",
