            "answer_text": "Yes - 3 times1) I heard my song (chorus) being sung by a well known band over a dept store\u2019s speakers. Freaked me out. I proceeded to take action. The attorney\u2019s for their label basically told me they would squash me like a bug and since I was a 19 year old kid at the time with an up and coming band, I couldn\u2019t afford to get black-listed. 2) some rapper took one of my instrumentals and rapped over it. Sued him, he settled. He still has to pay me every time it\u2019s sold and it can\u2019t be \u201cshelved\u201d (taken off the market) for 2 more years. 3) was in a movie theater and heard my score in a trailer. Called my publisher and within 48 hours the trailer was pulled from every theater \u2014 none of the other composers for the trailer were cleared either (in case you didn\u2019t know, the trailer music is usually not the music from the movie) ",

I don\u2019t care. First, I don\u2019t suppose for a moment that any one of them has ever made more than 50c from my material (because I\u2019m a nobody and no one knows me or my work)\u2026 and, if they\u2019re driven to steal others\u2019 artistic efforts to try to make some $\u2026 wow. That\u2019s pretty pathetic. bro. Hope you can make enough to keep your pet cat alive. Have at it, more power to ya. And secondly, that\u2019s all I ever wanted from music: Is for someone to want to listen to the music I make as badly as I wanted to make it. It\u2019s like baking a cake or crafting a sandwich: If you make it, and no one wants it\u2026\u2026 then, why bother? ",
