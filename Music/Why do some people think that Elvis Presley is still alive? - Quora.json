Elvis had a chronic drug abuse and chronic health ailments, which led to his untimely demise. They prefer to believe that the artist they admire is hiding somewhere and has faked their death either to clear up their finances, which is often the case with posthumous album sales, or enjoy a simple life without being chased by the paparazzi. There is absolutely no proof that Elvis is alive or any other star for that matter. Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, Prince are ALL DECEASED. God rest their souls. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do people think (or thought) that Elvis was alive after he died? A lot of people don\u2019t remember the newspaper articles so many years later after his death about men going through surgery to look like Elvis Presley. Believe it or not -I believe that\u2019s why there were so many people screaming that Elvis wasn\u2019t dead? Seriously, that is what happened and people couldn\u2019t remember the article but I do have a good memory even to the point reading about guys wanting to look and be Elvis - I\u2019m not saying that a lot of these guys were considered to be \u201cImitators of Elvis\u201d because a lot of them were but others that were such big fanatics of Elvis went to some extreme surgery to become him.
