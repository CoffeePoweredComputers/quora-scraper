            "answer_text": "It all depends on what you regard as easy.. Most Mozart sonatas, especially those in two movements (except the late ones), and the Schubert sonatinas are relatively easy. I\u2019m sure there is a lot of other stuff out there, though. Most of it will be rather low quality stuff by second-rate composers and/or arrangements\u2026 Also, the Dvorak sonatina is delightful though a tad more difficult. Bartok\u2019s Romanian Dances also come to mind\u2026 Most of Haydn\u2019s piano trios can safely be played without the cello (which simply duplicates the piano\u2019s bass notes). There is a lot of great music here, though of varying difficulty\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "many famous violin solos have a fairly straightforward piano accompaniment which can be simplified even further if necessary - for example the Meditation from Thais by Massanet, or the Intermezzo from Cavaleria Rusticana by Mascagni. Even the famous Czardas by Monti is not hard for a pianist, and easiest of all might be something like the Haydn Serenade (though the purists will all immediately recognize that its attribution to Haydn is mistaken - it was discovered to be by the relatively obscure Ramon Hofstetter). Once you get into real repertoire, especially sonatas, then the piano parts are usually more difficult than the violin parts. ",
