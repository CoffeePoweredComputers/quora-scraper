            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Now, I am not quite sure if you meant \"pieces for solo (as an unaccompanied) violin\" or \"pieces for violin as a solo instrument\" in your question. However, because Renaudo Christiansen-Robinson and Rohan Joshi have given you a pretty large choice of mostly accompanied pieces, I'll focus on the unaccompanied repertoire. Here are some of my personal favorites in no particular order. Bach, Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin - of course, to start my list off, this set of 3 Sonatas and 3 Partitas for solo violin deserves to be mentioned as these pieces are for violinists like the Pope and the Vatican for religious people. They are extremely challenging, technically and musically, but once accomplished, there is no much more you could learn about playing the violin. Ysaye, 6 Sonatas for Solo Violin - inspired by and written in the manner of Bach's set (even using some references to certain techniques, harmonies, etc), each sonata bares a dedication to a famous violinist (Kreisler, Szigeti, Thibaud, Enescu, etc). Again, technically and musically extremely challenging, teaching you the next step in skills and deep musical understanding from Bach, totally pushing any boundaries. Paganini, 24 Capriccios for Solo Violin - well ok, add these to the Bach's and Ysaye's sets and you will be considered a fully accomplished violinist.  Peter Hristoskov - a Bulgarian composer, who wrote two wonderful sets of Caprises for Solo Violin. The first one includes 12 caprices resembling the Bulgarian folk songs and dances. The second one (even more challenging than the first one) was again, inspired and written in the manner of Paganini's 24 Capriccios and same as with Ysaye's Sonatas, expands one's boundaries in understanding the different techniques used on violin as well as the philosophy of the 20-th century musical language. Absolutely worth digging for every violinist! Wieniawski, Etude-Caprises for Solo Violin - these are probably considered more like violin studies by some, the necessary link between \u00e9tude studies (Kreitzer, Rode, Dancla)  and Paganini caprices, but to me, these are little jewels which can always be used as a recital encore or something. Biber, Passacaglia for Solo Violin - this is the last movement from the last sonata from the Rosary Sonatas (or Mystery Sonatas) Piazzolla, 6 Tango-\u00c9tudes for Solo Violin - 6 short pieces to help you explore Piazzolla's tango style even further Prokofiev, Sonata for Solo Violin in D Major, op. 115 Corigliano, \"The Red Violin\" Caprises Kreisler, Recitative and Scherzo-Caprice There are many more of course, including the old masters (Scarlatti, Tartini, Locatelli, Telemann), sonatas by Bartok, Hindemith, Schulhoff, pieces by Stravinsky and Schnittke as well as many others. I am sure my list is quite limited and will be also curious to read what others come up with. ",

            "answer_text": "Now what you mean by classical, I am not sure. But I assume you mean the whole musical medium and 'Western Art Music' rather than the compositional period which is a subset within the musical medium. Also, I have to praise you on your phrasing of the question. There will never be one single best piece for the violin as it is entirely too subjective. The list that I am providing is what I find to be the best music, which I constantly return to. There are definetly more pieces that I have not put on this list, but I wanted to keep it relatively brief.  Brahms Violin Concerto This is a beautiful, beautiful piece. Johannes Brahms was fiercely patriotic, and rather than composing for his country he was a composer who switched it around. His music was composed by his country: passionate, and incredibly heavy. Listening to Brahms (in general) is not easy; I always have to focus and only listen to it. His violin concerto is no different; after a roaring introduction from the orchestra leads to a natural musical crescendo, the violinist enters explosively. Captivating the audience through difficult runs, and ending his phrasing in boisterous 10ths, the violin continually develops a very serious theme. You have to want to listen to Brahms if you want to truly understand his intent.  This piece is incredibly emotional, and incredibly serious. It doesn't try to show off the performers technical abilities (such as a Paganini concerto), but rather the performers musicality. It's a truly wonderful listen. My favorite performance of this piece is by Perlman.  Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto Where Brahms is serious, Tchaikovsky is romantic. This piece is the definition of Romanticism. Opulent melodies embellished with beautiful runs that show the power of the violin. The movements that really shine are the first and the third. The entrance of the violin is slow but develops into a wonderfully melancholy melody.  The theme of this piece is incredibly relatable. Relatable? Yes! Whenever I hear this piece I always sit back when I hear the theme, relax, and feel Tchaikovsky's emotional qualms rush into my ears. The third movement turns this \"unabashed romanticism\" into a rush of sorts; a rush which may be less emotional, but just as catchy and sticky of a tune. The Tchaikovsky is long and beautiful, and short and rough whenever it needs to be. It is (in many ways) an incredible piece for the violin. Playing it is difficult technically and musically- anyone can learn the Tchaikovsky, but only a few people can play and breathe musically through the Tchaikovsky. Again, Perlmans recording is the best.  Chaccone from Partita 2 by J.S Bach When people ask what beauty is, I always think of this piece. From the very first roll of the first chord, to the end of the piece, this piece is a magnum opus of everything that was written for violin.  The piece is polyphonic (for 1 instrument!). The violin plays multiple voices and multiple moving parts throughout the piece. But the way that Bach has done it is brilliant. He wrote the piece in a variation form; each change in melody is completely rooted in clean, crisp harmony. Frankly it's impossible to describe the aural wonder that this piece is. You have to listen to it to truly understand it. The best recording is by Jascha Heifetz. Once he starts the piece its impossible to stop it. Believe me, its incredible.   ",
