            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026it is absolutely possible. Anything is possible. But, it is a bit difficult at the moment. Why? Let me tell you. But before that let\u2019s take a look at South Korea\u2019s music industry a bit more closer. South Korea doesn\u2019t have dance songs in their movies or dramas like in Bollywood, Kollywood, Tollywood or any Indian entertainment industry. Their system makes the people look for nice songs and dance which the K-pop bands present for the audience. They have lots of music shows which helps the k-pop bands promote their songs and albums. They have lots of interesting variety shows where the idols can show their talents. All these shows interest all age groups and all genders of the audience. Whereas, in India, the movies themselves present us the songs and dances we need. So, why would people want a separate group to perform anything? If our music Industry evolves more such that it can afford good songs, albums to be made and can also promote damn well, then surely Indian pop groups might also take over the world. So, the three main requirements for Indian pop industry to bloom are: Good entertainment companies that willing to train and debut the bands that can make really good music and songs.Good music shows to showcase the groups\u2019 talent and promote their music.Respect and recognition for the people who are in the music field.It is plausible. But someone should start taking the initiative. I had the same question as you after I was introduced K-pop. I loved the songs but I started to wonder how their songs got recognition world wide while our songs, dramas and movies aren\u2019t that popular. Then, I ended up with the above answer after analyzing the two industries. I even wondered if I should start my own entertainment company. But then, forming a group and bringing out a successful album consumes a lot of time and a looottt of money. We don\u2019t have enough shows to promote the songs and YouTube is the only greatest way for good recognition. No one cares to buy an album here as all the stuff is available online (but people might start buying albums once the group becomes a bit famous). Plus, all kinds of the audiovisual songs with dance moves are already in the movies performed by the favourite actors. Also, we have this one big problem, language. Let me be honest, not all Tamil people know Hindi and Hindi is the language spoken in most of India. Our mother tongue differs. This causes a great issue. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all questions like these make me really uncomfortable. Stop looking at popularity and success as something to do with talent. We are diversified, we have so many languages and each of them have their own entertainment industry catering to their respective population. So, how many of us being Indians are aware of all the amazing songs from all the languages?? We are not, coz we are too diversified. On the other hand, they have only one language. So, with that it is possible to have that amount of popularity. And another reason is we have our own music sense, say classical, folk, Sufi etc. People outside our country can't relate to it mostly. In the same way, we don't have to copy pop, EDM or any other music genre just to be relevant or popular. Finally, we can be popular as much as kpop is but technically it's quite hard for us, for the above mentioned reasons. That being said, we don't have to care about being popular. We just have to be good at what we are doing. That's it. No matter how much I listen to kpop or other English music, when I'm down, I find myself listening to our classical songs. That's what I relate to, and it is our lyrics that makes me feel good. The motive of music should be to reach people not only being popular. ",
