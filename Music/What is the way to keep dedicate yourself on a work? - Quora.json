            "answer_text": "Let me share one story which keeps me dedicated - One fine day, there were 3 people doing some work. Another person came asked them what are they doing? Person 1: Don't you see? I am cutting the stones Person 2: I am doing work to earn a living Person 3: I am building a Hospital here All 3 people were doing the same work - cutting the stones. But the perception was completely different. You could imagine the dedication level of these 3 people throughout the day at work. Looking at larger picture of what you are doing will completely change the way you work . ",

Passion is born when you taste the success in whatever you did. And now you want to taste it again and again. That is how it starts. So, if you are willing to dedicate yourself to some work, then you should focus your attention in becoming the genius of that work. Just enjoy the work cause it makes you feel great. This not only guarantees your dedication to work but also makes you an excellence for it. :) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all If you want to dedicate your full brain into something you have to have some emotional connect with what you are doing. If you love something then your heart will instruct your brain. Instead most times it will be like this.  Source : Pintrest So without emotions, There is no life! Love your work due to some reason which makes a strong bond. Even the greatest of all, must have had some emotions towards something and that\u2019s the reason they are great in that. If it wasn\u2019t the emotion of loneliness within him during such a tender age, Cristiano Ronaldo would have been with his friends enjoying his life instead of playing with football! So everything needs a reason! An emotion! Without it\u2026. It\u2019s really hard! Good luck! ",
