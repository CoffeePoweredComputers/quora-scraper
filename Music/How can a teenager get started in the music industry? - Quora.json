            "answer_text": "1.) First off, know what you\u2019re signing up for. Being a music artist is not a job where you can sleep until noon, jam out for an hour, then get drunk or high at a party before your break. And even if/when you break through, getting too carried away with the party life has led multiple artists to their career\u2019s ruin or even death. This is a low barrier, high competition job, which means a lot of people want the same thing as you, and many of them will match you in skill and/or work ethic, or even exceed it, and even if you get in, that doesn\u2019t mean someone can\u2019t outshine you and have you out of the media\u2019s eye. Of course, you still gotta make school, family, and friends a priority first. But you also gotta be willing to bring your A game every day for probably years. 2.) Consider what genre you wanna do. Do you wanna be a pop singer constantly played on the Top 40 station? Do you wanna sing country and try to be this generation\u2019s Dolly Parton? Do you wanna be a rock musician? Note that though there is an audience for all genres, you\u2019re more likely to get commercial success in the pop, country, or R&B genre, as those are what dominate the current music industry right now. You might wanna do more than 1 genre, and that\u2019s OK. However, keep in mind that nowadays music genres are lot more political. For example, when Taylor Swift was just starting to stray from country and country-pop with songs like \u201c22\u201d, \u201cWe are Never Ever Ever Getting Back Together\u201d, and \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d, fans were already complaining that the \u201cold\u201d Taylor is gone (she definitely is now), even though in that same time she was still releasing Americana-esque, whimsy, feminine songs like \u201cStart Again\u201d and \u201cSafe and Sound\u201d. If you wanna be commercially successful, best stick to 2 related genres tops and not be overly eclectic early on. 3.) learn to write music. This isn\u2019t really a requirement per se, especially when the pop music industry is loaded with singers who sing songs written by others. However, in a world where many people can sing or play an instrument well, knowing how to sing/play and bring your own stuff to the table makes you stand out more than the guy who sings covers of the most famous \u201970s rock hits. Also, keep in mind that you don\u2019t really need to have a high understanding of music theory for songwriting in most genres, but it will help a lot. Not just in writing down how your mudic goes, but to analyze the structures of other songs as well to see what goes on in what genre you wanna do. Ideally, with time, you\u2019ll learn to write songs that are current but are also less formulaic than your competition. IMPORTANT: DO NOT SHARE ANY ORIGINAL MATERIAL WITHOUT COPYRIGHTING IT FIRST. Also, do not depend on \u201cadvice\u201d to give evidence for copyright without copyrighting it, like emailing to yourself or signing and dating a sheet of paper with lyrics. In court, someone accused of infringing can only be convicted if your song is registered in the U.S. Copyright Office. U.S. Copyright Office 4.) PRACTICE. Pretty self-explanatory. Every day, for hours. You gotta keep pushing yourself 5.) Get your performances out there. YouTube is a good start. Go to open mic nights to learn how to get over stagefright, interact with the audience, and perform, not just sing/play. A great way for exposure (with downsides) is to go on a televised competition (X Factor, America/Britain\u2019s Got Talent, etc.). The major flaw is that these are, first and foremost, TV shows. Before you even get a chance to perform on stage, you gotta audition with producers. They will determine if you make good TV material, talent aside. If you get through and are highly competent and become a top favorite contestant, however, it could easily give way to a big break. Also, try local events or venues. They might not pay, but it\u2019s a great way to get exposure, especially if you do it regularly, and make connections. Once you establish a reputation and high enough skill, you can eventually move on to paid gigs. 6.) Connect with fans via social media. Have at least a Twitter and Instagram. A Facebook page is a big plus. Update them regularly. 7.) Be patient and persevere. Most people don\u2019t become sensations within a year of committing to this path. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be a lucky minority, even if you can play guitar like Hendrix or sing like Whitney Houston. Most likely, you will not become famous as a teen, but if this is a career you care about because you love to perform and not just in it for the fame and parties, you\u2019ll learn to keep going even if you\u2019re not always feeling the passion or drive, and be ultimately happier that you\u2019re doing what you love than how many people know of you.

            "answer_text": "Starting in the industry itself can be as easy as picking up an instrument, recording a tune and releasing it yourself via cdbaby, Ditto Music, or the like. If you\u2019re actually looking to get started in the music business without being an artist, that\u2019s a bit different. Here are a few ways that can get Promote bands: I lucked out in growing up in Northern NJ where a confluence of events and people made for a rather thriving punk/ska scene that graduated touring bands like Midtown, Lanemeyer, Saves the Day, and Thursday among others. Now it\u2019s easier than share your love/support for an artist with other people over social media. Offering to help an artist with their social media presence (an online street team) is one of the easier ways into working in music.Make / design merch: Often overlooked \u2014 If you\u2019re hooked in with local artists and have some design/visual art inclination, you can always develop unique merch products and sell them at shows (or better yet, through sites like Merch by Amazon and Redbubble that will take care of upfront production expenses). Make sure to get the artists\u2019 permission first (in writing). Even if you don\u2019t know many local musicians, you can always link up with people on Reddit and offer to handle their merch in exchange for a royalty / financial compensation.Cover performances for a local or online newspaper: This is happening less and less. The ability to write and cover a live performance is one that can be done at any level/age (provided there\u2019s no age-restriction at the venue).Book shows: This one\u2019s a bit more challenging and will be contingent on organizational (and more importantly, trustworthiness) skills, but booking shows provides a great deal of access/exposure into the workings of the business.Volunteer for a local festival: Music festivals (and even non-music festivals that book live acts) are another way into the business. They\u2019re more educational if you can link up with the talent booker, marketing personnel, or legal staff \u2014 all of whom will have some access to the broader industry.Make your own records: Easier said than done, but if you have music you\u2019d love to see get introduced to a larger audience - there\u2019s no finer introduction to the music business than trying to record and release a record with people you love.This is by no means exhaustive - hope it helps!

Since you're in the teens - unless you are sure of a music area you are magnetized to, you have time to grow and try different areas. Be careful of disposable trendy poppy things. If your a pure creative type then start writing your first 100 songs many of which will be for learning experience. A few may be keepers. You could get your own \u201csound\" maybe your own act if you're obsessive enough, and yet personable enough to book gigs and bond with the audience. But you said \u201cmusic industry\". You might be a producer, recording engineer, a digital rights manager, a publisher, an owner of a record label. All \u201cmusic industry\u201d specialized areas that people cannot just fill out a job application get \u201chired\". If your getting skilled in some way, the music industry will just find you in it somehow. Read that again. : ) ",
