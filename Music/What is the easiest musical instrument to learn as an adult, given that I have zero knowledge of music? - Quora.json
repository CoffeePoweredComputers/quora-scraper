            "answer_text": "As a successful musician who has extensively performed for many years, I have been asked this question many times over the past four decades by fans and friends. I never gave much thought to my answer so I'd usually just say \u2018drums-becase you can beat the shit out of them when you're angry\u2019. When a close friend became terminally ill about 12 years ago she asked me for a suggestion for a way to release and escape from the pain. She needed an outlet and felt that a musical instrument would be a good idea. But what instrument? She wanted something that didn't require tons of lessons and practice to get a modicum of satisfaction. Definitely not a drum kit, or a tuba, she didn't have the physical ability to hold a guitar. So I suggested buying a keyboard, which she asked me to choose for her. After much thought I decided to get a unit that could provide \u2018instant gratification\u2019 right out of the box, and she could easily explore and enjoy the entire process of learning. So I bought her a Roland Arranger series bundle. Keyboard, stand, bench, sustain pedal and powered bookshelf speakers. Sets up in no time. (no I don't work for Roland). She was able to find slow soothing rhythm loops and she'd layer simple things like wind chimes and simple wood flute parts by just hitting only the black keys. Like Asian massage therapy background music. It had miraculous results on her mental health. She eventually got motivated to learn how chords and melodies are constructed, and she started writing and recording complete pieces all on this one simple keyboard. No, there's no shock ending to this story. She didn't end up scoring a LOTR soundtrack\u2026.. But she got exactly what she wanted and needed right from the start. A creative outlet that produced instant results and offered the easiest transition into creating her own music. All without the misery of violin lessons. Interesting note: Both of my boys are professional keyboard players. Why? Because I pushed them? Not at all. They grew up watching me create magical tonal landscapes on my digital sampling system keyboard (DAW). And they were drawn to that like mothts to a light. I let them play with my system after they were done with their chores. Miraculously, their Nintendo console gathered dust in the corner. No more Disney Channel or nickelodeon\u2026they just wanted to play with my keyboard system (note: my home studio uses a 7.1 DTS surround system with a 750w 18\u2033 subwoofer, so yeah, even hitting a C chord sounds like the second coming of Christ. Both my boys worked for me part time to earn the money to build their own DAW's. Eventually they got good enough to play professionally. No lessons, can't read music, they have great ears, and they play by feel. Funny, but I often found myself wandering into their bedrooms asking them how the hell they were making that sound! They understand music and general sounds as one universe of tools that can be blended to create new music. So my vote is to buy something like that Roland arranger. I think Yamaha makes a really cool one as well. Best of luck! EDIT CORRECTION: My youngest son decided to learn the guitar instead of keyboards. He took formal lessons for several years and received a few recital awards. So I bought him a MIDI guitar system for Christmas about 10 years ago. Long story short, he spent his time trying to emulate keyboard parts. He bought a cheap Casio midi keyboard, plugged it into his computer and the midi guitar was never played again. My point is that there is something very gratifying about having the entire universe of sound at your fingertips. It really inspires creativity. Because you're not limited to the narrow constraints of a single instrument. ",

            "answer_text": "No musical instrument is easy to learn correctly, without hours of dedication.  You will gain musical knowledge, sometimes without even realizing it, by learning the mechanics of the instrument.  That being said; Pick and instrument that you like hearing.  You're going to hear it a lot while you are learning and most likely, it will not sound great when you are first learning.  So, it's important to at least like the sound of the instrument.   In my opinion, I think someone who is serious about learning an instrument should buy a quality instrument from the beginning.  One school of thought is that you should buy something inexpensive or \"cheap\" to start, in case you don't like playing.  Let me tell you that you won't enjoy playing a cheap instrument.  A better quality instrument is just that.  It will sound better and be easier to play.  If you decide later that you really don't like playing it then you have made a good investment and can sell it, trade it, or keep it and let it appreciate in value.   LISTEN - The most important exercise in learning to play any instrument is to know what it is supposed to sound like when played correctly.  By listen, I don't mean to just \"hear\" it.  I mean to devote your full attention to the notes and the style of the musician playing the notes on the instrument.  Pay attention not only to the notes but to the space between the notes.  The space is just as important as the notes themselves.  Listen to the volume, tone, tuning and dynamics used.   Get familiar - Sit down with your instrument and really get to know how it feels and sounds, how it mechanically works and how to care for it.  Think of your instrument as an extension of yourself.  It can only produce music if the music is already in you.  Copy what you hear others play.  Play along with your favorite songs, then turn off the music and see what you can play on your own.  Now you are creating! PRACTICE - PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!  Here's where the devotion enters the equation.  Practice makes permanent, maybe not perfect, but permanent.  It doesn't have to be perfect and even can be more expressive if it is not. HAVE FUN - It's been proven that listening to music stimulates the brain more than almost anything except making music.  You'll be addicted in no time.  Go to jam sessions and introduce yourself to the musicians there.  Ask to play with them.  Before long you'll be wanting to get in a band.  Good luck!  ",
