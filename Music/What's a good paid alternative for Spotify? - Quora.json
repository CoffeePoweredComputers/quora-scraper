            "answer_text": "Apple Music Apple Music has an edge over the competition for one big reason: exclusive releases. It was the only place to stream Adele, Drake, Chance The Rapper and Frank Ocean's newest albums upon release and it remains the only service that streams Taylor Swift's \"1989\" record. The service also offers a ton of playlists, many hand-crafted by musicians and tastemakers, however it lacks the robust sharing options built into Spotify. 2. Amazon Music Unlimited  Amazon Music Unlimited is the newest kid on the block. It looks to follow in Tidal and Apple Music's footsteps, signing an exclusive contract to release Garth Brooks's latest record. Brooks doesn't have the same hip factor as Drake or Beyonce, but neither does Amazon Music Unlimited. Rather than having a big focus on helping subscribers stay on the cutting-edge of music, the service features recommended playlists and radio stations that are grouped around artists you've already listened to. 3. Google Play Music  Google Play Music works as a streaming music service and a music locker. It allows you to store and stream your entire music library (up to 50,000 songs), as well as stream any of the 30 million songs in its catalog. Instead of playlists, well-curated radio stations are the standout feature of Play Music. Unlike playlists, which are finite and contain specific tracks, radio stations play endlessly and are updated often. What makes these stations unique from other services is that you can view the entire track list and save it as a playlist. 4. Tidal  Launched by hip-hop mogul Jay Z, Tidal is the only streaming music service that offers high-fidelity streaming. Its superior sound quality is similar to what you would get on CDs and other physical media formats. Like Apple Music, Tidal has a leg up on other services with exclusives. The difference is that the exclusive content on Tidal is usually from one of its superstar co-owners. This year alone Tidal was the exclusive home to stream -- at no extra cost beyond the monthly subscription fee -- Beyonce's stunning visual album \"Lemonade,\" Rihanna's highly anticipated new record and Kanye West's controversial \"living album,\" \"The Life of Pablo.\" As a fan of those artists, I've found myself resubscribing to Tidal, just to listen to the newest albums.
