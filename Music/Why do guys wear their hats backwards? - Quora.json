How old are this guys, it says I\u2019m still pissing of mom. It\u2019s now a sad clich\u00e9. Some construction workers wear their hardhats on backwards because it\u2019s hard to see up forward with the visor, but a study shows most do it as a fad too. I only turn my baseball hat around when using a camera, working where I need to look up, I wear glasses, a dark under brim cuts glare, keeps rain off, and frankly I dry, comb my hair with a towel, your head gets sunburned. I had to start wearing a bandanna under a bicycle helmet because my head was getting tanned to the vent holes. I looked like a guest alien on The Orville TV show with that tan. If you need a hat without a brim buy yourself a beret. If worn properly and you get one that you can size, you have to stretch them the real ones for hat size, best hat I have found for winter. It offers, if sized right, you buy by the diameter, not hat size, it can offer just enough brim for rain, sun, will not blow off the head surf fishing with a wind, on a ferry getting there. You can shape it brimless like the military, thing rolls up in the pocket. 100 percent wool, warm as can be, wind doesn\u2019t blow through it. This is the ultimate suburban commuter hat. I do find it a little hot walking a fast 5 miles, but most people don\u2019t do that, my dogs set the pace in the woods. Personally I hate baseball caps they were actually designed to blow of your head when running, or to be removed quickly by outfielder during outside day games, that is why they have a large stiff brim, to find the brim, to spin it out of the way. They were usually for the day most hats of the era had a soft brim, like train engineers caps where they were subject to wind blowing in open cabs, needed to stick head out the window, need something to keep down the dirt, coal dust in hair. These brims were two short, too hard to grab the bill being soft for baseball. If you look the earlier baseball capes were soft short billed. The first hardhats were actually two baseball caps put together backwards and a tar like substance applied. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do guys wear their hats backwards? Some of the other answers are quite funny. I was unaware that so many people hold such animosity toward baseball caps. Here are a few other considerations: Many people do this to help protect the back of their necks from too much sun exposure.Others do this when they are riding bicycles, skateboards or motorcycles to prevent the hat from catching too much air and flying off.Some mechanics and carpenters wear a hat to keep things out of their hair but don\u2019t want their vision impeded by the hat\u2019s bill.Some people have long bangs or unruly hair; and, they wear a hat backward to get their bangs out of their eyes (at least until they get a haircut).Some people use a cap as a sweatband to keep sweat out of their eyes while they are working out. The brim can be distracting when you\u2019re strength training.Some people simply like the way it looks. This is no different from other fashion trends that men or women utilize that seemingly make little real-world sense.",
