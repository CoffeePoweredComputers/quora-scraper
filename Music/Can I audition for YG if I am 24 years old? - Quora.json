            "answer_text": "well, kpop idols usually train for years. as for yg\u2026 they\u2019re known for the \u2018dungeon\u2019. they will train you for years and years and you\u2019ll never know when you\u2019ll debut. jennie trained for 7 years, jisoo + lisa for 5, ros\u00e9 for 4. it\u2019s also extremely hard to get into YG. for ros\u00e9 it was a 700:1 and lisa was the only one who got into YG as a trainee. korea isn\u2019t the best at accepting older kpop idols either. newly debuted idols are 16\u201320+ years old. i would say, if you think you have a lot of talent & potential, try out for a different company. YG is really hard to get into, and even if you get into YG, training years are long. and who knows? YG might kick you out for being too old! try for a company that is known for letting trainees debut 1\u20133 years after training. generally, i would say if you work very hard you can debut after 1\u20133 years. but even so, it\u2019s a tough battle between you, and other young talented girls waiting to debut. so go for another company, but if u really want to try out for YG, go for it. smile, be nice, let your personality shine through, dance / sing / rap well, and i guess your safe ! good luck ! fighting ! \u2661 ",
