Be aware that Apple have really extended their security in OSX since Mojave through to Catalina , and non notarized software will get refused by the operating system . There may be other workarounds that specialists know about that I don\u2019t, but in essence Apple is trying to make all its software \u201c valid\u201d and fit for purpose , and by the notarization process this ensures a safe environment for the end user . Also \u2014 be alert to the fact that malicious code is sometimes found in apps that have been distributed as cracked software . Good luck !! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve looked at this a little, and it seems there are reliability issues with running any shell software for running these plugins in a 64-bit host. I know there are plugin developers who have gone out of business - KeyToSound are an example, and I had two of their synths - and that it\u2019s frustrating when updates to the OS or host DAW mean their products don\u2019t work any more. All I\u2019ve been able to do is either fortuitously have frozen the track before the update happened, or bounce the track to audio and keep the MIDI to use with another synth. In the case of effects, you just have to find an alternative. I subscribe to developers\u2019 emails, and visit KVR audio regularly, to keep an eye out for updates. I recently found that a plugin I really liked and thought I couldn\u2019t use any more, Valhalla\u2019s FreqEcho, had actually been updated and would now work with my system again. ",
