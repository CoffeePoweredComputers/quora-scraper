            "answer_text": "Is it? Oh wow. Sgt Pepper used to be number one followed by Pet sounds then Revolver. What\u2019s Going on is a great album and I\u2019d highly recommend everyone check it out at least once. It could be the greatest album. It\u2019s a subjective thing obviously and no matter which album is chosen most people will disagree due to the number of albums out there. I wonder if it got chosen this year because of the strange times we\u2019re in at the moment. Some parts of the media said it was like 1968 this year because Black Lives matter, the protesting and the riots. What\u2019s Going on was recorded in 1970 and came out in 1971 and I suppose an analogy could be drawn to the end of the 1960s with all the hope (and division) and then reality hit home in early 70s with Nixon and the Vietnam war still going and maybe a feeling that the world didn\u2019t change as some people had hoped and the problems were still there with new problems added. Obama\u2019s Hope and Change left a lot of people disappointed although he did do some great things. Then in came Trump who has been accused of abuses of power and who lies regularly. The times of Trump are a bit like Nixon in a way although there are some important differences as well. Maybe this point in time makes \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d seem particularly relevant again. It\u2019s always been a fantastic album but the way things are this year has probably pushed it up to number one. ",

            "answer_text": "The Rolling Stone ratings are based to a large degree on the influence an album had on other artists. To that point, I defer to their expertise. However, I don\u2019t nearly care as much about that as how much enjoyment an album has given me. To that I say, \u201chuh?\u201d There are a few great songs on the album, but with all its choirs, violins, and preaching, I find it bit dated and sanctimonious. And, most of songs all sound too much alike. Bongos and falsetto singing on most of the songs? Greatest album of all-time? That\u2019s nuts. If you want a mellow-ish party album with a similar vibe - Roxy Music\u2019s Avalon is much better to my senses. Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon is less upbeat, but is far more magnificant.
