I will tell you this back in the late 60\u2019s I heard Janis sing ..I went nuts and bought all of her Big Brother and the Holding Company albums.. she was the greatest singer I ever heard ..when she left Big Brother and went on her own I thought she was crazy to do so but she was still a great singer ..dope and booze started to get to her and you could see it in her face she looked like shit\u2026in 1968 or early 69 [I am not sure of the years] was going to see her in San Francisco with the Dead and some local bands, but I couldn't make it\u2026my VW Van broke down near Salinas Ca\u2026then I figure I would see her In L.A. later that year..but I never did see her..but I did buy all of her records..she was the best singer\u2026 .there has been no one like her not even close ..the closest one is Lady Gaga\u2026..the other night I watched her on YOUTUBE from Germany she did a great concert and her voice was in top form\u2026..THERE IS NO OTHER SINGER LIKE JANIS JOPLIN\u2026..when she died I was so mad at her and upset I gave all of her records away to friend and didn't keep any of them. I still don\u2019t have any CD\u2019s or records of her\u2019s and don\u2019t plan to..I wish I could see Janis in concert ..all I can say is she was great. ",

            "answer_text": "Better is always a matter of personal taste. Amy Winehouse had more range and an ability to sing effectively in any style. I think she was the more talented vocalist. I also think she was a better songwriter. Janis Joplin was an also an accomplished writer, but arguably her two biggest hits, \u201cMe and My Bobby McGee\u201d and \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d were written by others. In terms of record sales, Amy Winehouse has sold over 23.5 million to about 18.5 million for Janis. This despite Janis having a 35 year head start. Still you may have to give the edge to Janis Joplin based on her cultural impact. Prior to Joplin and Grace Slick women really had no place in Rock and Roll. There were girl groups going back to the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s, but these were pretty acts singing about their boyfriends. A rough edged woman fronting a full out rock band was unheard of. The significance of that can not be overstated. Particularly during the 60\u2019s when women\u2019s rights were just becoming part of the national conversation. In the end Winehouse had more talent, Joplin had a greater impact. Take your pick. ",
