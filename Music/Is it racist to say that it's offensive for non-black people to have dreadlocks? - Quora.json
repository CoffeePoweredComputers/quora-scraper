Did you know what a big deal hair is to black people? It's huge. It's been outlawed. It's something which has only recently been \u201cacceptable\u201d for people to wear their hair natural. It's still often discriminated against in the workplace. It's ridiculous. Back in the not so distant past in America, natural black hair needed to be covered, as in - by law. The ladies developed a beautiful style of hair coverings which were - you guessed it - eventually appropriated by white women (remember the turban fad)[1]. It's not just black culture which gets appropriated; and it pisses everyone off when it happens. So this isn't a situation of black racism or over-sensitivity; this is righteous indignation for centuries of bullshit. Honestly, more white people need to know about. talk about, and call this crap out. IJS. Recognise and then check your privilege, white people, for crying out loud.

It frankly disgusts me. It's double privilege when some blonde/blue eyed person with dreadlocks gets offended for having their appropriation called out. Perhaps it's time to learn something real about the cultures they are stealing from in order to be fashionable. To me, they look ignorant.

If you want Rastafarian Dreads that would either be racist or sacrilegious. It's more a religion that a race? I'm not clear on that bit. I've tried speaking to whites and blacks on this but, you know, they were so very high! And not so coherent lolz ",
