            "answer_text": "By making more money from selling music than they spend on financing the artists who produce the music. Every sale of a recording generates income for the label. Their contracts with artists normally specify what percentage of their income goes to the artist and how much they get to keep. If the label have paid for the recording, duplication and distribution of the music they'll usually stipulate that their costs should be repaid first before the artist gets any money. A successful recording will generate more income than what it cost to make. This money not only finances future recordings but offsets losses on the records that don't sell, and there are more of those than there are multi-platinum hits. A record label's artist roster might only include a few acts who generate any serious money, alongside others whose status as \u201cserious artists\u201d means they give the label prestige that less critically acclaimed but more commercially successful artists can't. The most highly regarded industry figures tend to be the ones perceived as having balanced artistic and commercial concerns equally- putting out \u201cgood\u201d music while making enough money to keep the lights on.
