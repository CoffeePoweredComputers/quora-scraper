It\u2019s well worth while signing up with KVR, as there are sometimes offers and competitions, as well as weekly emails which can be helpful. I check KVR regularly, and I\u2019ve just found 3 new free instruments while writing this, by checking \u2018Newest\u2019 instead of \u2018Most Popular\u2019! ",

For extra free VSTi, check out the free stuff that most famous plugin developers provide. Try Native Instruments, u-he, etc. Also, do keep an eye on the Plugin Boutique store. They give a lot of free stuff every month. Hope this helps. PS: Do NOT crack software to use them for free. Support the industry. ",
