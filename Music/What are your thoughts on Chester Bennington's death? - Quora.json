            "answer_text": "Chester\u2019s suicide affected me in a way other musicians\u2019 passing have not. In a way the countless other talents we have lost during my lifetime have always passed me by with a \u2018sad, but this death means something more to someone else or another generation entirely\u2019 thought. I felt that it wasn\u2019t my place to be upset and that it would be almost \u2018rude\u2019 to speak to others or appear affected by the passing. Chester and Linkin Park definitely spent a time as my favourite band. \u2018In The End\u2019 was the first song I downloaded on Napster. I rocked out at my computer for hours at a time, all while listening to one song on repeat for 30 minutes - waiting for the next to DL on my 56k line. When it became \u2018cool\u2019 to hate on Linkin Park after Meteora I played along with other kids and claimed they were poseurs. Meanwhile I was desperately waiting for new material while the Gorillaz, Tool and Blink-182 kept me occupied. Eventually I matured to a point where I didn\u2019t care what others thought of my taste in music and proudly told others I loved LP even as an adult. Now I feel like a \u2018tool\u2019 for doing this but I bet Chester wouldn\u2019t have minded haha. When I learned of Chester\u2019s suicide I thought it was a joke. I looked all over the internet for info and when I found Mike Shinoda\u2019s tweet confirming I felt deeply saddened. Chester feels like the first major contributor to music of my own generation to have passed. I know what it must have felt like for Keith Moon fans or Hendrix fans - now I definitely know what Nirvana fans felt when Kurt ended his life (I was only six then). This has without a doubt changed me - this feels very real. Survived by six children and a wife. Thoughts are with them and his mates.RIP Chester Bennington. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty upset. First of all, it\u2019s sad to hear about the death of another human being. I mean, he has friends and family, and others who care about him. It\u2019s natural to feel sad for the death of another person. This guy has made friends with his bandmates, and they\u2019ve been with him since, at least, 1996. Over 20 years of bonding. To see a long-time friend just up and die is pretty damn awful to watch or to learn. In addition, he has a wife, and six children too. It\u2019s going to be Hell for them, as they\u2019ve lost a husband and a loving father. But it\u2019s particularly sad to see him perish because, well, he\u2019s a very popular musician, who has touched a lot of people. Look, the guy touched a lot of people. I took a look at Linkin Park\u2019s record, and his band, needless to say, is very popular. According to the Linkin Park - Wikipedia page, they have sold more than 70 million records, and that they\u2019ve been called one of the most influential bands of this generation. And I agree with them, wholeheartedly. Part of the reason this band is so popular is for the same reason that, IMO, Metallica is popular, or even that Pink is popular - really good musicians are able to tell stories or analogies with their work, whether it\u2019s instrumental, vocal, or both. And I think that, at the end of the day, he is among those legends. Many of his songs tell cool stories, like \u201cCrawling,\u201d which is about the effects of drug abuse, and, IMO, \u201cIridescent.\u201d Songs like this tell a story that we can relate to, y\u2019know? While I personally am not the biggest fan of Linkin Park, I do love some of their pieces. Certainly \u201cIridescent\u201d and \u201cNumb\u201d come to mind when I think about the band and how they\u2019ve influenced thousands of people. Those songs certainly influence me. It\u2019s also really hard to swallow because of HOW he died. He died as a 41-year-old man, not by being in a car wreck, not by a heart attack, not even by being caught in a shooting, but by his own hand. He committed suicide by hanging. And I think that this really drives the point home about how destructive suicide, depression, and drug abuse in general can be. While being a badass on stage, he, too, faced a struggle off-stage. He faced alcoholism and drug abuse, and he wrote about this and other problems in some of his songs. They were his release, but unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s similar to Robin Williams and his act of suicide. Who would have thought that a successful actor, comedian, etc. would be so vulnerable to the cold, Hellish grip of self-hatred and self-vitriol? Suicide is said to be a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But for someone who\u2019s stuck in a hole like this, \u201ctemporary\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d are the same word. And this is the real horror of his death. He likely killed himself because he thought he was worthless, that he was weak and unable to pull himself out of his addiction, that he was not worth a breath of air or a drop of water from Earth. This, unfortunately, comes at a time when he was worth everything to his fans, his friends, right up to his wife and children. I hope that his family and friends will be able to make it through these dark times, along with his fans. I also have high hopes for Linkin Park. Hopefully, they\u2019ll be able to carry on the legacy without him. It\u2019ll be hard, but I have hope for them. If you feel as though you want to end your life shortly, I beg you to not do it. I beg you to at least wait one more day. Talk to a friend or loved one, talk to a stranger. Talk to the Suicide Hotline, at 1\u2013800\u2013273\u20138255. But please, don\u2019t give up just yet. ",
