            "answer_text": "Probably the Ukrainian song most instantly recognizable to people in the West is \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d (\u0429\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043a) by Ukrainian composer Mykola Dmytrovych Leontovych, which was based upon a traditional Ukrainian folk chant, and is usually heard at Christmas.  A popular Ukrainian song that is practically the unofficial national anthem is \u201cChervona Ruta,\u201d written by Volodymyr Ivasyuk. You will hear it anywhere Ukrainians gather to sing and is covered by virtually every Ukrainian band and singer.  The national instrument is the uniquely Ukrainian bandura. The B&B project are a group of Ukrainian musicians who popularize traditional instruments by playing everything from covers of popular rock and pop songs to classical favorites to traditional and modern Ukrainian songs.  \"\u0419 \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e \u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\" is a jazzy/folk/pop song by Ilaria. It is a type of song you might hear at a Eurovision competition.  Another mainstream pop sound is \u201cFriend\u201d by a band from Sumy called The Elephants.  Rock fans will appreciate The Hardkiss.  If you are looking for something a little funkier, I recommend \u201cRozy Donbass\u201d by Dakh Daughters, a seven women band who are equal parts musicians and theatrical performers.  Also, a band that interprets traditional Ukrainian folk songs with a modern twist is DakhaBrakha, my favorite Ukrainian band. Their song, \u201cCarpathian Rap,\u201d is a fun song about a village girl with too many boys to choose from.  DakhaBrakha played \u201cYanky\u201d at Glastonbury, where it was a hit with the crowd, as you can see.  \u201cYahudky\u201d is a haunting song, also by DakhaBrakha, and my personal favorite.  ",

            "answer_text": "I scrolled down to glance at what others suggest and it broke my heart. With all respect, most of these songs are old, sad and dusty ones. As a representative of a younger generation of Ukraine I`d like to speak on behalf of fresh and modern music of my country. We are (mostly) not living in huts and playing banduras anymore. We can make the music of XXI sentury too :) So here are a few of my favorites. I chose only the ones in Ukrainian. Panivalkova. Three girls who play a few dozens of insrtuments. And their music sounds like magic. Unfortunately, they`ve already split up.  Latexfauna. I`ve been to their concert three years ago when there were barely a dozen of people. Now they`re having sold-outs everywhere they go. They sound like no one else. Unfortunately, you might not be able to feel how terrific this band is due to the language. They use not pure Ukrainian language but this untranslatable dialect called \u201csurzhyk\u2019. And in their case it sounds fun and natural and totally worthy.  Jadan and the Dogs. Something that you might not totally get too. Jadan (I`m quite sure that it`s spelled like Zhadan, but in this video they wrote it with J, so let it be) is the poet who writes mostly about the Woman and the dirty realism of dark ages of Ukraine (the 90th) or living in the deep province (which is still somewhere around 90th). And his music (ska-punk) is quite the same. Bandit-ish I would say :) This one, for example, is about booze.  Postman. Simple, but fair. This one is about Kyiv streets. Makes me cry and love my city even more.  He also plays in one of my favorite bands 5 Vymir. Light and charming.  Boombox, eternal classics :) Almost as old and dusty, as Okean Elzy, which someone here has already recommended. But when you`re sad and need to become even more sad - that`s exactly what you need. (The Gitas are nice too, actually).  Here`s the same one in Spanish, hurts me so much that I can`t breathe.  Alina Pash. She tried to start her career in Ukrainian tv-show like \u201cThe Voice\u201d but, as for me, she was just another girl with fancy voice and no spark, boooring. But look at her now! She mixes western Ukrainian traditional motives with quite modern approaches. And looks and sounds so stylish, I`m in love.  Alyona Alyona. She came out of nowhere, created this video and woke up famous. Almost like Justin Bieber did, but she is better (says me who can`t stand rap music at all!). The video may look pretty weird, but it has it`s own charisma :)  They also sang together ;)  Yuko. Another interpreters of Ukrainian traditional music.  They also have a duo with already mentioned by others amazing Dakh Daughters.  And bonus track. Atomic Simao. Something psychedelic from the outter space. In case you like such things.  And bonus track number 2. Brunettes shoot blondes sing in English, but they are marvelous (you definrtely should see the video!). To be honest, for the long time I thought they were British\u2026  I hope you`ll enjoy it! I also have a long list of English-singing artists. Can help you with that too :) ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't translate consistently in English: but a generally accepted version is Plyve Kacha. It is a folk song, some 600 years old now: but it speaks to the risks and costs of war. It also has become a kind of rallying cry for the Maidan protests in Kiev in 2014. It's a beautiful song if you understand Ukrainian, and has traditionally been sung as a conversation: but I heard a version sung as a lament. It was amazing. It was done I think in 2016, on The Voice Ukraine, Holos Krainy. The complete song can be found on YouTube. It's worth seeing. It was sung by Inna Ishchenko, and she played the bandura while she sang. It is haunting, beautiful, and sends a powerful message. Thank you Michael! When I wrote this I couldn't remember her name. It's been many years since I knew Ukrainian, and not enough to live in country-but I still understand the song and still love it. I may also be incorrect in the traditional meaning I give this song: a couple of great friends of mine from Belarus taught me the song and the language (they were both fluent), and they told me what the song means in a national context. If I erred, my apologies. It's still a great song though. ",

But I \u2014 through circumstances I don\u2019t want to get into \u2014 have a few songs of their excellent laid-back rock on my playlist that I absolutely adore, even if I don\u2019t understand a word. Part of which is due that you can\u2019t understand a word even as a Ukrainian, or so I\u2019ve been told. What\u2019s more, since Ukrainian sounds a little like Russian (to me, at least), Russian native speakers will say, \u201cWhat in the world is this guy singing about?\u201d before realizing it\u2019s not their language after all.

One of my favorite Ukrainian folk songs is Oj Czyj to Ki\u0144 Stoit (I cant write in cyrillic) It is a song about a Kozak who is in love with a girl, but the girl is giving her love to another man.  And here below is a more modern rendition  Being a Pole, I also love Hej Sokoly, which is shared by both Poles and Ukrainians. It is about a Kozak who is leaving his beloved Ukraine, and is also bidding farewell to his girl. Here is the Ukrainian version.  And here is the Polish version.  The next song is a very beautiful song, titled The Sun Sets. It is a ballad about betrayal in love.  ",
