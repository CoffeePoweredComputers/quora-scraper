            "answer_text": "Well, does it matter? He doesn't need much musical or literary talent, he's a rock star. No, really, I mean that, but hear me out. It's not an insult.   Rock music is mostly pretty rudimentary. There's a skill to playing it, sure, but it's not artistic rocket science. It's more like sexy dancing: if you have the right body shape (or are willing to exercise till you can acquire the right body shape), and can spend the time to learn the moves, basically almost anyone can do it. Vedder does seem to sing in tune live, though, and that's something.  As for literary talent, rock song lyrics generally are not what you'd call \"literary\" texts. They can be powerful, meaningful, touching, or whatever, in the context of a song (or, specifically, a performance of a given song) but put them on paper and they're usually... well, pretty simplistic. Which is to say, they're not even in the same ballpark as what we talk about when we talk about \"literature.\" Double-meanings and the odd two-dollar word are usually about as complex and nuanced\u2014as multidimensional\u2014as they get. They don't need to be literary, and actually rock lyrics that get \"too literary\" often end up being an impediment to a song working well.  (Take it from me as someone who had to shift from writing actual verse to writing song lyrics, the kind of literary complexity even in a mediocre poem can be too much for rock song lyrics. Folk can support more\u2014I think of Nick Drake's songs as quite lyrically complex and musically beautiful\u2014but the complexity and beauty aren't really crucial even in folk: lots of folk songs are as simple, musically and lyrically, as mainstream popular music.) And all of that's fine.  None of this is an insult to people who play or consume popular music. Hell, I sometimes consume popular music in several forms myself, though much less exclusively that most people I know. It's just to say that popular music (rock, pop, country, hip-hop, soul, house, etc.) isn't primarily about the music, or about lyrics. You get cases where the music or lyrics do happen to be interesting, but that's essentially secondary most of the time, and not a determinant of success or popularity. That's because popular music is about identity and self-branding: you get to be part of one or another affinity group\u2014all of which think of themselves as \"cool\"\u2014by consuming one or another form of popular music.  (As jazz saxophonist Branford Marsalis noted, most people don't go to rock concerts for the music: they go for the spectacle, for the experience of being there for the show. They even sometimes (often?) talk until the songs they happen to like start being played; then they dance or sing along in such a way that they actually can't hear the performers clearly. And this is what you're supposed to do at a rock concert, mind: sitting still in the audience and listening intently, the way you would at any sort of music-centric performance (jazz or classical or traditional Indian music or Chinese opera) is actually weird. Take it from me, I've played in a rock band and the audiences who sat intently listening with great seriousness in indie rock clubs always seemed odd, and not just to me.) Simply put, in most popular music the music and even to some degree the lyrics are peripheral, or, rather, are supplementary\u2014they play a supporting role to what is essentially a kind of modernized vaudeville performance: story, song, attitude, fashion, and sometimes dance (or antics) all bundled together. Sometimes it's bundled mastefully, and that's a kind of genius in itself. But it's not literary or musical genius, but rather some other form, focused on synthesis, identity, emotional drama, storytelling, fashion, and the modeling of a kind of attitude and self-presentation.   In other words, essentially, Eddie Vedder is a highly successful modern vaudeville performer, just like every other popular music performer our there. Saying this does not detract from his (and his band's) activism, financial success, his ability to sing in tune or pen highly popular songs, or the right of their fans to enjoy their recordings and live performances. It's just to say you don't need (much) musical or literary skill (let alone literary or musical talent) to be a successful rock star. You do need skills and/or talents that you don't so much need if you're just an actor, or a musical performer in a more music-centric area, like say playing the jazz saxophone, or a poet writing celebrated verse like, say, Seamus Heaney or Adrienne Rich. Different disciplines, different skill-sets.  So the question, finally, is a bit nonsensical. It's a bit like asking, in an accusatory tone, whether a successful dentist is trained in psychiatry or heart surgery. He or she might or might not be, but what's not clear is how those disciplines relate to the practice of dentistry. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely he does! Are you familiar with the soundtrack to \"Into the Wild\"? Check out Eddie Vedder's fingerstyle guitar playing on that album -- incredible! He can also play a decent electric guitar, but his acoustic guitar skills are excellent. Literary talent? Well, he's one of the best songwriters to come along in 20+ years. Do you consider that literary talent? Check out songs like \"Black\" or \"Porch\" for a peek into his genius with words.  The man fronts one of most important bands in the history of rock music.  Is he talented? Heck yes! That's the understatement of the year!  Listen to more Pearl Jam and hear his genius! ",
