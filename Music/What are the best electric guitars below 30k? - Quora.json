            "answer_text": "If you like Les Paul style guitars then get the Vintage V100, it\u2019s the best les paul style guitar under 30k. It has a nice Mahogany body with Mahogany set neck. It\u2019s better than Epiphone and Cort in terms of quality, fit and finish, and tone. You can upgrade their pickups down the line with a Seymour Duncan Antiquity set to get a more classic tone (Sheptone Tribute 4 or Blue Sky pickups are better for getting real PAF tones but they aren\u2019t available in India). If you want a 7 string guitar with fret scale greater than 25.5\u2033 then go for a Cort K57B or Cort KX257B. You can easily tune them to Drop A without any problem. Or you can buy the Squier Standard Stratocaster or Telecaster, or with a little more money you can buy the Classic Vibe series Stratocaster or Telecaster. They are pretty good for their price but don\u2019t try to compare their quality with real American or MIM Fender guitars. Squier is no doubt a sub-brand of Fender but it\u2019s a sub-brand that essentially produces cheap versions of popular Fender guitars, their quality is nowhere near to a real Fender guitar. If you want a guitar that has a fast neck then go for an Ibanez RG470FM, RGA42, RG421AHM, or RGR321EX. While buying an Ibanez guitar always remember that GRG =/= RG. The RG series is way better than GRG and its neck profile is way more flatter and faster than GRG, and even the neck radius of RG is very flat. If you\u2019re a shredder you\u2019ll absolutely love the feel of RG\u2019s neck. ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost I would like to say that it all depends on what you want your sound to be like. There are variety of setups to choose from in that range. There are single coils, humbuckers, combination of both and what not. Fender Squier Stratocaster Standard (20\u201324k) With a wide variety of Squiers to choose from, it's easy to lose track of what model you're looking at while starting out as a new electric guitarist.  An absolutely beautiful guitar with single coil pickups and maple fingerboard comes in 3 variants: Candy apple red, Black and Antique Burst. Also it has a tremolo and can bear normal wear and tear and is good for learning and gigging. Mostly used for playing blues, country, pop and classic rock. Fender Squier Standard Stratocaster Maple Electric Guitar Ibanez GRG250DX (28\u201330k) A guitar with a combination of Humbuckers and Single coil pickups definitely offers some great versatility and sounds to experiment with. Comes with rosewood fingerboard and 5 way switch. Mostly used for heavier styles of music like Rock and Metal but then again it's versatility can be utilized efficiently in the right hands.  Ibanez GRG250DX Electric Guitar Sterling by Music Man AX3S-R1 (29\u201332k) An original, classic design, the AX3 features a 5-way selector, asymmetrical neck, and vintage style tremolo. Two Humbuckers with 5-way switch offers some great tone variety. One great thing about this guitar is that it has a Jatoba fingerboard which is unusual for a guitar at this price point and is thus worth checking out.  Sterling by Music Man AX3S-R1 Electric Guitar Schecter Omen 6 (25\u201328k) A great guitar with two Humbuckers excellent for gigging and heavy music. This guitar sure as hell can take a beating and still be able to produce mostrous sounds. One downside is that this guitar has a 'string-thru' body which means that it can't have a tremolo system. But don't let that diminsih this guitar's monstrosity. It's available in 3 beautiful colours as well.  Schecter Omen 6 Electric Guitar There are still 'n' number of guitars available in this price range. You should definitely head to your nearest store to check each guitar out but keep an eye on the ones mentioned above ",
