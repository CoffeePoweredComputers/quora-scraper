            "answer_text": "I would have to disagree with one of the answers below because instead of trying to spare yourself from embarassment by not singing in falsetto anymore, you should use your performing experience as a learning tool to improve it. Staying in your comfort zone does not improve yourself as a vocalist, and you will not grow your voice that way. That said, typically, you have a good or great falsetto if it does not sound either excessively breathy and weak or highly screechy. The latter can be more subjective because artists such as Bee Gees and King Diamond utilize falsettos that can sound screechy for those not used to it, but nevertheless manage to give them great careers. While it will always sound slightly disconnected and a little bit breathy (as long as it is not excessive and weak) at times, you can still achieve a nice, fuller sound with it through practice, and doing so will add a useful tool that you can utilize creatively as a singer. Listen to Jeff Buckley, Matthew Bellamy of Muse, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Michael Jackson (especially on songs such as Human Nature and Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, although he sings in his full voice quite often), and David Gates of Bread for examples of a typically very good falsetto - they rarely, if ever, sound excessively breathy or screechy when doing so, and manage to use it to amazing effect, creating some of the best music around. If your falsetto sounds extremely weak and airy, then you know for sure that you have to improve it. As someone who is training to strengthen his falsetto himself, from my experience it can be done as you improve your vocal cord closure while at the same time not forgetting your breath support when singing. Try some Brett Manning falsetto/head voice exercises that you can find on the Internet - his exercises really help to improve your cord closure in order to not sound weak and breathy. ",
