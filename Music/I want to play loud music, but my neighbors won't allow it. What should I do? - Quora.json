            "answer_text": "If it isn\u2019t loud enough that they can feel it shaking their house up then it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. However you need to respect their wishes, and they privacy. If you live in a house then you have a bit more freedom to blast your music. If you live in an apartment however, then the walls are probably thin and you\u2019re going to have to respect them. NO ONE likes not being able to have peace and quiet. If you do live in an apartment then you\u2019re going to have to lower the volume and deal with it. Talk to someone like a police officer to see when loud music becomes a public disturbance, that way you\u2019ll really know how loud you can play your music. ",
