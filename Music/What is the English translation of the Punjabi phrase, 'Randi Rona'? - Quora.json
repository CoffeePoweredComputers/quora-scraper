            "answer_text": "The other authors have answered this question very brilliantly. However, my interpretation and use are as follows: This phrase is usually used in our Punjab/India when we go to the usual complaining about our failures. And start laying the root causes; nowhere is an example.For example, I go to a Government office to get some work done. I come home, and my wife asks me: What happened in the office our work/complaint/problem. As nothing was achieved and I would answer to her: Same Randi Rona. She would understand what I am trying to say in a very concise way. Nothing was done, and the office had the same usual answers, a. It is a lunch break. b. The officer is not here. c. We cannot attend to it, and we are short staff. d. This kind of thing happens, what is your problem, to complain. e. This is not my job; go to the other department. f. The file does not move, and it gets clogged in the system unless you throw some grease into it. g. And the usual list goes on. This is called Randi Rona; in other words, just the usual, nonperforming answers, laying blame on the system/lack of resources/not my job/ This is called Randi Rona. In other words, it is a very concise answer to someone who asks you how your day was? And you simply answer The same Randi Rona, it means I did not achieve much today, I went through the usual frustration listening to excuses. And I believe this phrase started in Rural Punjab, and it appears Randi, a prostitute, would always complain that she was not compensated adequately. And lay the blame on the client. From that origin, it moved to the other day to day life in Punjab/India and Punjab/Pakistan, or it started from the united Punjab. ",

            "answer_text": "Randi = ProstituteRona = Crying. Typically meant to describe people who behave like Prostitutes when she has not been paid or treated unfairly. Or has a perceived injustice. Also to signify a person who did something wrong. Is in the wrong. And is crying about it. i.e. she should not have done what she did in the first place. Prostitute her self. And is now crying about it. So no sympathy. Somebody crying or wailing about something that they brought on their own heads and are now looking for sympathy which they will not get. In case your wondering yes its my favourite phrase in the world. lol. ",
