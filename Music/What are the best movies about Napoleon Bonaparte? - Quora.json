            "answer_text": "It seems that Waterloo (1970 film) - Wikipedia is the best one about Napoleon Bonaparte out there. Its rating on IMDB is pretty high, it has 7,3/10, was nominated for awards and has won few, as well. This movie is fantastic, because if you want historical accuracy, you came to the right place. Details of that period are all on point, and the same goes for weapons and uniforms that were worn. And so, it is highly praised for staying true to even the smallest details. He had the technicians reconstruct the entire battlefield, and actually had 20.000 people on set to recreate the French army. It also has a great and professional cast. It\u2019s considered a classic when it comes to war movies, so you might check that one out. The next one that would come on my list is War and Peace (1956 film) - Wikipedia, brought to us by the same man, Sergei Bondarchuk. Mainly because Sergei said: \u201c\"We have tried to involve the spectator in the events on the screen to make him experience what Tolstoy's characters experienced and the atmosphere in which they lived.\" And he made it true. It\u2019s the best thing about this movie, you\u2019re definitely going to become emotionally involved, feeling like you\u2019re right there. You\u2019ll be on the battlefield fearing for your life. And again, attention for details was not missed in this one either. As for the rest of the movies, Monsieur N. (2003) and Napoleon (1927) are probably loved for a reason. ",
