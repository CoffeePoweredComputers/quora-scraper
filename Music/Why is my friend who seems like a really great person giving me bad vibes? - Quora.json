I also don't know the details of what's happening when you get these bad vibes. Here's what I do know. When someone gives me the creeps, I avoid them. Your subconscious might be picking up on something, that you don't yet understand. Some creepy people are very good at hiding their creepiness. Trust your instincts, and choose to be safe. I would avoid contact with this person until I could figure out what the malfunction is. Always trust your instincts, there's a reason we have them. ",

It could be something harmless like something they do or own reminds you of someone bad from your past but it is better to be safe than sorry. Life has taught me to renounce my hopeless optimism. If they really are the check out ok variety they will forgive your doubt. ",
