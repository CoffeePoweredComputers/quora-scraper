            "answer_text": "No,i don\u2019t think blackpink songs are meaningless.Periodt. its just difficult to understand the meaning but they have some songs with deep meanings\u2026.we don\u2019t realize it beacuse we are too busy looking at the dance moves or the artists and beats that we forget the surroundings,which have a lot of meaning. Let\u2019s start with DDU DU DDU DU\u2026. The first scene we have is 1.lisa throwing colours  This is not just for visuals and funky colour concept\u2026..but if you look carefully you will realize the colours are shaped like wings of bird symbolizing freedom and there is lots of reference to this in the mv\u2026.. 2.Queen Jennie  She is the queen in chess and she has made her own rules and choose to live her life the way she wants too\u2026 3.we have 2 rosies.  The white rosie looking like a princess.  The black rose dressed normally(even though she still looks stunning) In this the white rose is how everyone look at her as\u2026 a gorgeous princess and the black rose is how she is from inside\u2026.a normal human being\u2026..she passes just like a shadow. 4.Celebrity Jisoo  Jisoo is portrayed as a very famous celebrity\u2026and everyone are there taking her photos of that huge poster in which she is shown as the white jisoo(or how she is seen by crowd) whereas the real jisoo(with pink hair) is ignored but then she falls\u2026\u2026  and the whole crowd is pointing their phone towards her like gun\u2026 this scene has many theories- Theory 1-This one\u2019s a lot abstract\u2026.the crowd is there for her when she is walking towards the camera but the when she falls she makes a mistake and the whole crowd is now against her and are pointing their guns at her\u2026.this means people will be by your side only when you are known but it won\u2019t take them a second to change their side if you make even a single mistake. Theory 2- If you look carefully in the first picture the fake social media jisoo gets all the attention and everyone think that she is like that even in reality what they fail to understand is that she is also a human from inside just like them and when the normal/real jisoo makes a little mistake\u2026\u2026..the same device which was first used to praise her is now used as gun(symbolizing trolls and roasting)\u2026..the whole scene says how toxic can social media be\u2026.. There are actually many scenes in this video but the problem is that i am too lazy to write them all soo\u2026.if you want to see all the scenes and their meaning watch this video\u2026..  In conclusion:This song is based on the cons of being a famous person\u2026..toxic social media,getting hate,being pictured as someone you are not and freedom\u2026 The problem is not the video but the lyrics\u2026.the video has a good amount of meaning but the lyrics are made very meaningless just to give that catchy tune and beat\u2026.i think they can work a bit harder to make the lyrics correspond to the meaning\u2026.even though they do a liitle bit like- A good face and an unfavorable attitude\ucc29\ud55c \uc5bc\uad74\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud0dc\ub3c4 The volume hidden in the delicate body doubles\uac00\ub140\ub9b0 \ubab8\ub9e4 \uc18d \uac00\ub824\uc9c4 volume\uc740 \ub450 \ubc30\ub85c I don\u2019t have to look straight ahead without hesitation\uac70\uce68\uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c1\uc9c4 \uad73\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c4 \uc54a\uc9c0 \ub208\uce58 If it's black, it's pink, we're pretty savage (BLACKPINK)Black \ud558\uba74 Pink \uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc608\uc058\uc7a5\ud55c savage (BLACKPINK) When you want, take it openly\uc6d0\ud560 \ub550 \ub300\ub193\uace0 \ube8f\uc9c0 Whatever you do, cut water with a knife\ub10c \ubb58 \ud574\ub3c4 \uce7c\ub85c \ubb3c \ubca0\uae30 so there is a little more effort needed in the lyrics tho\u2026..i am a blink, i love their visuals their video but just want them to work harder on lyrics\u2026.i support them and i know they can do it\u2026..but please just try to cut a little bit of sassy(ness) from their lyrics and add a bit of warmth in it please\u2026.just because you favour a band doesn\u2019t mean you have to appreciate everyone single thing they do\u2026.. so are blackpink songs meaningless?No. but hard to understand because of a lot of sass included in them for eg- if you wanted something easy\ub9cc\ub9cc\ud55c \uac78 \uc6d0\ud588\ub2e4\uba74 Oh wait til' I do what I doOh wait til' I do what I do Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du duHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du Ah yeah, ah yeahAh yeah, ah yeah Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du duHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du Ah yeah, ah yeaAh yeah, ah yeah Dududu dudududuDududu dudududu Credits- lyrics-google Image source-Google and me for taking the pain to write it all down\u2026\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d Edit: After the release of \u201cthe album\u201d you really don\u2019t have the excuse of meaningless songs at all!! [Pre-Chorus: Ros\u00e9]Even if the whole world changesI'm still the sameI dreamed of this path I walkedAs it was then, as it was thenThe first time I danced every dayI was left there this is definetly not meaningless!! even the chorus has meaning But you'll never know unless you walk in my sho\u0435sYou'll never know, my tangled strings'Caus\u0435 everybody sees what they wanna seeIt's easier to judge me than to believeThe old thoughts I hid deeplySometimes grabbing me and tormenting meThe more I do, I'ma shine, babyYou know they ain't got a shot on me love the lyrics!!

            "answer_text": "No. BLACKPINK songs aren\u2019t meaningless. And it\u2019s not complex to understand either. Just because they use a lot of interjections, doesn\u2019t mean they are meaningless, and I for one learned a lot of things from them and started to live with dignity and self-respect. Basically, BLACKPINK songs are about love. They tell us not to love anyone but ourselves, to be independent and live with self respect. We are the most important people in our lives. It is okay to be sassy and tomboyish, but be honest to yourself too. BOOMBAYAH: It means love without regrets and live life to the fullest. They girls are young and unaware of the world around them. They just enjoy life with absolutely no worries about the future. The song relates to our childhood carefree days, and is THE BEST DEBUT SONG EVER! WHISTLE: It\u2019s about first innocent love. They have fallen for this boy and are trying to get his attention. The song portrays the emotions one goes through when they first fall in love. This, like Boombayah, isn\u2019t a very grown up song. PLAYING WITH FIRE: It means things won\u2019t always be as good as they seem to be and that there are painful realities in life. The girls fall in love, but regret it immediately. Unlike their fantasies, love is really painful in real life, and they feel they should have listened to their mother and stayed away from love. STAY: The girls give the message that we shouldn\u2019t become too dependent on others, or we will crumble when they leave us. It beautifully portrays the emotions we go through when we are being ignored by our loved ones. They ask their lover to stay, and say they\u2019d rather sit in awkward silence with him than have meaningless conversations with others. P.S: This is a very meaningful song for both PINKS and BLINKS. Keep loving our girls. AS IF IT\u2019S YOUR LAST: It\u2019s a very colourful and cheery song, telling us to look at the good things during bad times. Unlike their other songs, this song doesn\u2019t have a dark theme, so the meaning is actually pretty clear. They ask their lover to love them as if they are his last love or to set them free because they can\u2019t handle this love. DDU-DU DDU-DU: It gives the message \u201cBe independent and savage, because you are important.\u201d The actual BLACKPINK concept is portrayed well from this song. They confront their lovers and warn them. The ddu-du ddu-du is used to show how they will shoot him out of their lives if they are ignored. SOLO: It gives the message \u201cEveryone\u2019s independent existence itself is significant, and we are all shining stars.\u201d Here, Jennie breaks free from a toxic reletionship, but continues to love herself despite being heartbroken. She says we must spend our time alone because we must me honest to ouselves. KILL THIS LOVE: It says that no one is permanent in our lives. The break up with their lovers, and say us that after a HI, there is always a BYE. \u201cWe all commit to love that makes you cry, we are all making love that kills you inside\u2026.We must kill this love yeah sad but true\u201d says stop looking for love which is painful and start living for yourself. HOW YOU LIKE THAT: It gives the message \u201cForget haters, they will never be equal to you.\u201d This song was exclusively written for haters. They say don\u2019t give a damn to what the society and people around you say about you. You win and prove them wrong. ICE CREAM: It tells us to live our life the way we want. They have fun and flirt with men, with to long-term commitments and carefree attitude. An adult version of Boombayah, where they refuse to accept burdens and responsibilities even when they have to unlike in Boombayah they were still young and innocent. LOVESICK GIRLS: Again, here, it is stated that we are priceless. The girls are in love, and when but the relationship is very one-sided. The song portrays feminine power and says love is a drug we must all quit. It is okay, they say, to be lovesick rather than in a toxic or one-sided relationship. That\u2019s it for today. I know it was rather long + I was lazy to write the meanings of B-side tracks from their mini-albums and albums. But I am not lazy to fight anyone who hates on BLACKPINK and says their songs are meaningless. We all have our tastes, but it\u2019s better not to hate than to hate and get dissed. ",

            "answer_text": "I need to start off by saying\u2026 I am an ex blink and an ARMY. I do not want to be seen as toxic or anti. I don\u2019t only stan bts. I stan multiple groups, popular and unpopular, rookie and senior, girl and boy. Please don\u2019t bash me for my opinions. I have to say, from a professional point of view, that BP\u2019s music is very much alike to western artists. The Pop Music culture specifically. I understand that BP went for a story revolving around love. As shown in the MVs and the lyrics. This concept is like western music because, if you haven't noticed, pop music usually has love lyrics, or \u201cpeople falling in love\u201d lyrics. I mean it seems kinda just typical to me, but they pull it off. They don\u2019t have the feel of let's say, for example, 19 by Stray Kids, or like Young Forever by BTS. Those songs have a feeling to them that makes the song meaningful to both the artist and the fans. Blackpink songs are generally upbeat, and not very diverse in the vocal range. Not saying that meaningful songs have to have a diverse vocal range. Other than a few songs, like Stay, for instance, BP lacks strong emotion and closeness with fans with their songs. I understand that BP doesn\u2019t choose their concept or songs. They get picked and they sing them. Meaningful? Not really. Meaningness? Not really either. Sorry, I haven't answered anything in like forever, -E. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think BlackPink songs are meaningless. I mean it\u2019s very hard to NOT give a song a meaning unless it\u2019s just a string of random letters that don\u2019t even make coherent sentences. However, I\u2019m starting to tire of the lyricism in their songs. Their songs are excellently produced and the choreography as well as the beat is designed for people to dance to it easily and for it to be very memorable. Despite that, I have a lot of problems with their chorus. It\u2019s usually just a phrase or a word then some loud onomatopoeic sound. Let\u2019s see: Boombayah. Yeah yeah Boombayah. Yeah yeah Boombaya ya ya yah. Boom boom ba, boom ba, oppa. My love is on fire. Oooh, Now burn baby burn. Hit you with that Ddu Ddu du. Ay yeah ah yeah. Let\u2019s Kill this Love. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Rum pa pum Don\u2019t know what to do. Don\u2019t know what to do without you. Yeah eh ay. Forever young. x4 It honestly just seems like the laziest writing ever (which I don\u2019t blame the girls for), but I\u2019d like an actual chorus this time. Often groups do this because they\u2019d like a beat drop to focus on some amazing dancing. But in all honesty, Blackpink\u2019s choreography is quite simple so it seems unnecessary. I hope this comeback foresees an actual chorus. ",

I find their songs meaningless because it\u2019s mostly break up songs or savage songs, and it lacks emotion and warmth. That\u2019s just my opinion, but I wish YG would give those wonderful girls some space to explore. \ud83d\udc9c ",
