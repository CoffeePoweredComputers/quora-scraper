            "answer_text": "*In no particular order... EXO- ChenBaekSoo (Chen, Baekhyun, and Kyungsoo) are some of the most talented vocalists I\u2019ve heard, especially Kyungsoo. I mean their solo songs do them justice. I highly suggest them.GFRIEND- Yuju herself is powerful enough but then you add Eunha and the rest of the members and you have (in my opinion) one of the most talented vocal lines of the third generation girl groups! Plus they\u2019re extremely stable despite their difficult choreos.Super Junior- I don\u2019t stan or follow them much but I\u2019ve heard the trio of KRY (Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung) sing and they are truly phenomenal. Not to mention that Kyuhyun and Ryeowook didn\u2019t have even a year of training! They\u2019re truly just naturally gifted.Red Velvet- Wendy, Seulgi, and Joy are all fantastic vocalists, especially Wendy. All have likable and rich voices. I would even say that Irene and Yeri are above average vocalists.SHINee- Jonghyun and Onew are absolutely amazing, with large ranges and good control. Even Taemin who I heard was said to be \u201ctone deaf\u201d during their debut has improved to be a great vocalist.Mamamoo- All four members are incredible and stable vocalists. I mean they are a true vocal group after all. Wheein being especially amazing to me. Even Moonbyul, who is the rapper could easily be the main vocalist in several other girl groups.Pentagon- Jinho honestly has vocals for days. Hui as well! Even their rappers are pretty good vocalists.EXID- Solji is a very strong and powerful main vocalist, I feel she is awfully overlooked. I mean she won King of the Masked Singer! Hyerin is also really good.BtoB- I\u2019m in the midst of stanning the them and I can say that their main vocalist Eunkwang can easily give EXO\u2019s Chen a run for his money seriously. The other members are impressive as well!SNSD- Hearing TaengSic (Taeyeon and former member Jessica) harmonize together is always a treat. Tiffany and Seohyun are really good too! Taeyeon herself has already proved to be one of the best female vocalists ever in K-Pop.Honorable Mentions: MONSTA X, Got7, iKON, Day6, NCT 127, ATEEZ, BTS, Seventeen, Stray Kids, f(x), Apink, LOONA, WJSN, Dreamcatcher Please comment any others that have good or unique vocal lines! ~Mya ",

            "answer_text": "MAMAMOO- for me they are hands down my favorite vocal group. I like how distinctive their voices are and they are very very stable hence you even enjoy their performances.EXO - Chen, Baekhyun, DO, Xiumin. Exo\u2019s vocal line is amazing amazing amazing.Red Velvet - all the girls are amazing singersG-idle\u2014 . The girls can sing rap and Minnie Miyeon are like the best vocal duo I've heard.Stray Kids- just a note, all the nine can sing very welllllll. Personally, i love Woojin\u2019s vocals, so soothing to hear.Seventeen- do i really need to explain this??? I don't think so. If you haven't listened to Seventeen please do. I'd recommend home as the first.5hinee- back then, Onew and Jonghyun were the powerful duo!!!!!! Then as time passed Minho, Key and Taemin\u2019s vocals really really grew and now it's every single one of them who is amazing.Girl's generation - their vocals were amazzzzing.BTS - the vocal range of Bangtan is impressive. They may not have an excellent vocal line but no one can disagree that Jin, JK, Jimin, V kill it as a vocal lineEdit :::: Thank you for mentioning some groups like Pentagon, Gfriend, Infinite, Beast etc. I personally hadn't listened to them as deeply as i listen to the groups I've mentioned above. I've watched a few masked singer episodes of Pentagon\u2019s main vocal u think and i agree that these groups have great vocal lines even more tha. BTS. I know bts vocal line isn't the best but it's a diverse flavor that I personally like. Anyway, thanks for enlightening me with groups such as Gfriend and the ones I've mentioned above, they are really great. ",
