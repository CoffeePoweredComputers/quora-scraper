            "answer_text": "We don't need music. It is really just one more of many ways in which humans have learnt that it is possible to stimulate our mind. There are plenty of deaf people who can't perceive music, and lead perfectly fulfilled lives. There are even people with cochlear implants who can hear, but can't perceive tonality in music as the average person does; and they, also, get along just fine. Are traditional musics important? Well yes - for one to retain artistic diversity in music: if a person has a larger variety of music to choose from, they are more likely to find something that resonates closely with them. Separately, a larger number of surviving parallel musical traditions means a larger number of existing musical tools and philosophies for creative people to choose from, draw from, adopt or use to make music that best does what they want it to. And then there's the whole thing of cultural identity and stuff, but that's not something that necessarily is best looked at from a purely \u2018musical\u2019 perspective. The words \u201cInternational music that is heard everywhere nowadays\u201d makes me think the asker had pop music in mind. The thing with pop music is that it is driven by a commercial motive - by considerations of what sells. This does not mean that the music is necessarily artistically \u2018shallow\u2019, but artists are heavily directed in their work by what the largest numbers of average people are likely to be receptive to. Other forms of music may be differently motivated, or may be directed at more narrow groups of (sometimes) more discerning listeners\u2026 and that may be seen as better for the quality of the art that is produced.

            "answer_text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart once said \"There are only two types of music. Good music and bad music.\" All good music is important. To be able to appreciate good music of any type and any genre should be everyone's goal who is passionate about music. So no type or genre of music is any more important than another. They're all equal. Music is important because it makes us feel things that we wouldn't feel otherwise. There's actually a specific part of our brain that responds only to music, though \"good\" music typically lights up our entire brain when we listen. Music is also important because it teaches us to use our ear, and good musicians are often very in tune with the sounds of the real world too as a result of years of training. Music, like any other art, teaches us to appreciate the world in a way we otherwise wouldn't. Also like any other art, it's very culturally important, but culture is ever-changing. So modern music is just as important and no more important than a culture's traditional music. ",
