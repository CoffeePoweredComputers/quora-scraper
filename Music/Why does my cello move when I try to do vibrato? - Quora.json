            "answer_text": "Why does my cello move when I try to do vibrato? Without actually seeing you play, I can only make suggestions. A very common basis to many problems is gripping the neck of the cello with your left hand. Vibrato, shifting, intonation, and hand/wrist pain are major ones.You could be trying to move too much, maybe shaking your entire forearm or hand for vibrato.If you are moving your left shoulder back and forward, the cello will move that amount as well.If you have a teacher, he/she should study you from multiple angles, including from the back. If you are trying to learn on your own, I suggest having a friend video you, again, from multiple angles. This will at least allow you to see what you are doing without simultaneously playing. ",
