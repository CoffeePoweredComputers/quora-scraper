            "answer_text": "Hi. I am a Wynk app user and it works pretty fine with Google Home. It works well with Spotify too but not sure about other music apps. You can stream music live or create your own playlist with Wynk. My personal playlist includes around 50 songs and have been using it with Google Home for some time now. So I guess you can go ahead with Wynk if you want to play music in Google Home. ",
