He had no fucking music! Did you hear about Jay-Z rapping when he was 12? What about the guy round the corner from me who likes to MC? No? Its because they haven\u2019t released anything at that point, so there\u2019s nothing to hear. If you need to ask the internet to figure that out, you need to spend more time in school than thinking about hip hop music. Just goes to show who is listening to this once great music, and the reason it\u2019s so easy for bullshit to be passed off as quality to these fans\u2026smh. ",

But most people aren't tapped into that world, so that's why most people never heard of him before that. Then he signed with Dr. Dre and boom. 0 to 100 REAL QUICK ",
