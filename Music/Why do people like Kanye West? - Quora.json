            "answer_text": "As a person that has seen more episodes of Keeping up with the Kardashians than I am comfortable admitting, I feel I can answer this. He seems like\u2026a person? Like, really. His antics on screen, from messing with Taylor Swift, to hopping on stage and interupting people, to selling a white t-shirt for $120 Kanye West APC's $120 Plain White T Shirt Sells Out To telling people he is a literal god, he doesn\u2019t seem to act like a person. But\u2026he is. He seems smarter than we give him credit for (he knew his fans would buy a shirt with nothing on it for $120. He understands his audience at least) and he\u2019s a legitimate great dad, from what I remember. He cares about family, leaving in the middle of one of his shows when Kim had that whole robbery thing go down, to getting along with most (if not all) of Kim's family (and they are hard to get along with) He\u2019s nuts, I\u2019m not ignoring that. He has a bigger-than-average ego, even when compared to other rappers and artists, and again, has a habit of getting himself into crazy antics. But I do not hate his guts. As a musician, I think he\u2019s better than most of the garbage on the radio, and I\u2019d 100% rather listen to him than 90% of all the \u201cgangsta rap\u201d out there right now. I wouldn\u2019t call myself a \u201cfan\u201d not in the slightest, but what I\u2019ve heard of his I\u2019ve approved of. His albums aren\u2019t all \u201cbitches and hoes\u201d anthems. They are about him talking about himself (no surprise) most of the time. So I\u2019m neutral about Kanye West. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s president-worthy (he said once he was running for president in 2020. West v. Trump. I swear to christ, if now\u2019s not the best time for a one-way ticket to Europe, I don\u2019t know what is) but what\u2019cha gonna do? ",

            "answer_text": "If we're talking about people who might vote for him, no idea. But if we're talking about music: because it's good and creative, and because his style keeps evolving. A neat thing you can pay attention for is how he uses the human voice, not just in his raps but even in his beats. See for example these two early songs, whose beats are both built out of vocal samples (also showcasing his famous soul music influence): Jesus Walks  Hey Mama  For a taste of how his sound evolved from then: Say You Will (influenced the lower-key, more pensive-emotional kind of rap you sometimes hear now)  Blame Game (decadent piano+cello; also features a filthy, hilarious Chris Rock skit)  New Slaves (raw, industrial)  Kids See Ghosts (dark, ethereal)  Closed on Sunday (spiritual)  Also, he just has a lot of drive, and that's inspiring. E.g. people thought he should stick to producing and would never make it as a rapper, but he did; people thought he'd flop when he tried to join the high-end fashion world, but he didn't; etc. Heck, his first single as a rapper, called \u201cThrough the Wire,\u201d was rapped through a wired-shut jaw from the car accident that in retrospect changed his life:  ",
