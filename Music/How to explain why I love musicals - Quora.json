            "answer_text": "How do you explain why you love chocolate ice cream? Why we love or prefer certain things is a very complicated any tricky question to answer. If someone asked me why I love musical theatre I could certainly answer that it is because of the souring emotions that are portrayed in musicals, so overwhelming that simply speaking is inadequate and the characters must sing. I could answer that it combines the best of dram with the best of opera. Or I could answer what is most likely the real reason which is that I was exposed to musical theatre when I was very young in my formative years and the love grew from that. So many answers. ",

            "answer_text": "The same way you explain why you love sushi, action films and the colour Green. You shouldn't have to explain yourself as to why you enjoy something. If somebody asks you what the appeal is of musicals, you should recommend they go see one for themselves, on stage like it should be. If they still aren't blown away (assuming it's a goodie, off course, like like wicked or Jersey Boys) then it just isn't for them and that would be that. And if they come back and criticise you for enjoying what you enjoy, well then they're probably religious extremists or bigots and just need to be politely told to fuck off and mind their own goddamn business, shouldn't they?
