            "answer_text": "I don't have any reaction to it because Amazon is not releasing Four More Shots season 3 any time soon. What Amazon did announce was that it has renewed the series for another season. Which means, that Amazon has told the producers to make another season for them. That's it. It will have to be shot first, in order to be released. Mirzapur season 2 on the other hand will be released this year. It's most probably in its final stages. Besides, Amazon will make its decision based on user data. Four more shots presently is the most viewed Indian show on Amazon. Its not a good show. But people like it so surely, Amazon would want to keep the momentum going. ",
