            "answer_text": "We do have to decide what music it is that we call classical music! The word classical can be used for any art, a science (\u201cclassical physics\u201d) or even for an entire culture. But it usually means something that has been around for a long time (as in centuries or millennia). Particularly, in Europe from 1300 to 1600 or so, there was a \u201crenaissance\u201d, a rediscovery of ancient ideas from the ancient Greeks and Romans (300 BC to 500 AD) that had been largely forgotten. In general, any idea that was good enough to deserve to very high work and expense of being copied and recopied over centuries, commanded a certain respect. This may be hard to understand in an age that is always interested in the latest new thing - but people are also very interested in things that endure time. Time grinds most things to dust, but spares others. And we call the others \u201cclassics.\u201d Note: we have classic cars, classic rock, classic soft drinks - and if we are not sure something old will stand the test of time again, we call it \u201cretro.\u201d There is also a sort of mythology that classical artists and musicians created their works out of sheer love of ideas or beauty, and that modern people just do it for money. This is completely false (Beethoven made a living from writing music and performing it for princes; and the starving artists in Paris in 1870 would have been delighted to make a big sale - though the big sales didn\u2019t come till a hundred years later when we decided their paintings ere \u201cclassics\u201d). Some say that dividing line between \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d is that the classical has \u201cserious purpose.\u201d Hmp. I don\u2019t know what serious purpose the Minuet in G had. It was just a cute little tune that Beethoven scratched out that went viral. We don\u2019t know what music we make today will be called \u201cclassical\u201d by some later generation. As the announcer on the classical radio station says, \u201call music was once new.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Most strictly, Classical with a capital \u201cC\u201d refers to an era (mid 1700\u2019s to early 1800\u2019s) which means mainly Mozart and Haydn. Beethoven bridged the gap from Classical to the next era \u2013 Romantic. Most loosely, it means any music that has transcended its generation (like classic rock). Most commonly, it means any kind of music composed previous to the 20th century before widespread recording proliferated styles beyond the ability to easily categorize all the new varieties of music. But of course there are many exceptions made for 20th century composers like Copland and Prokofiev and even Scott Joplin and Gershwin because they composed for classic instruments and orchestras in a way that feels more \u201cclassic\u201d than blues, showtunes, rock and roll\u2026 Perhaps for more than any other reason, we call it classical music to separate it from pop, rock, folk, etc so that when people are shopping for music, they know what to seek or avoid.
