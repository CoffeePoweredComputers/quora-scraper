            "answer_text": "Echo is what it sounds like - a reflection of sounds from a surface. It is the same sound, but typically quieter and more diffuse. An echo effect for an audio signal can be manipulated, but ultimately it\u2019s the same sound reflected back. Professional audio studios used to use large rooms with smooth, hard plaster walls with a speaker at one end and mics near the walls to pick up the reflection. Now there are electronic effects that do the same thing in a stompbox-sized package. Reverb is an effect added on to the sound. The original reverb units used a physical spring with transducers on either end. It imparted a \u201cwobbly\u201d sound to the signal. The amount of source signal and reverb-processed signal can be blended depending on the desired effect. Again, there are stompboxes that do this now. I use an Electro Harmonics Holy Grail myself. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re asking about the effects: Echo and Reverb? Reverb is, generally an algorithmic effect. That is, an multi-effects processor has a program that emulates the sound of a source in a real environment, or some extension of that idea. It\u2019s generally composed of a series of delayed repeats that are cross mixed between the two sides in stereo to create the sense of space. It can be derived from an analog system that also creates short, chaotic reflections like a spring, a plate or even a BBD chip with multiple taps. Echo isn\u2019t as well defined a term, but is usually used in the music realm for some kind of delay signal. This is where the input signal is sampled, delayed either in an analog fashion (BBD chips) or digitally, then released. By using a feedback loop to inject the delayed sound back into the input you can have a series of echoes like the canyon example. By modulating the delayed signal you can create special effects like flanging, chorus, ADT or just a modulated delay that can sound like a tape delay. ",
