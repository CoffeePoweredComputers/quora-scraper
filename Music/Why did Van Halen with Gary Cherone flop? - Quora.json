            "answer_text": "I am an exclusive group. I am one of only a handful of people that actually bought Van Halen III when it came out. I had been a Van Halen fan since I was about 12 years old. I loved the Roth era and the Van Hagar era. I was upset when Sammy was ousted from the band, and even more upset when the possible reunion with Roth at the time fell apart. So, I had a lot of hope for Van Halen III. I really liked the first single from the album, \u201cWithout You\u201d when I heard it. The song had that Van Hagar radio friendly sound to it that I was used to hearing, and like many Van Halen songs, it was catchy\u2026at least to me. Then I bought and listened to the rest of the album\u2026 Van Halen flopped not because of Gary Cherone, but because of Eddie Van Halen. It is my personal opinion that Eddie during this period was not a sober person; not a well man in general. Whatever he was doing drug-wise was seriously affecting his songwriting abilities at the time. The whole album is forgettable, and from what I\u2019ve read, not a Van Halen album but an Eddie Van Halen solo album. I have read Eddie played ALL the instruments on the album or allowed very little input from the rest of the band. The song \u2018How Many Say I\u2019 is a song on the album that Eddie sang lead on\u2026and it is cringe worthy at best. So Gary joins and comes into the shit storm that is Van Halen. Hagar is gone, a singer that arguably helped usher in the most successful period for Van Halen. Then a possible reunion with Roth becomes a casualty of both Roth\u2019s and Eddie\u2019s egos and personal animosity towards each other. Gary has stated that they should\u2019ve toured as a band first, if only so that they could have time to gel together as a group; that never happened. Gary also stated he felt like a \u201cstranger in a strange land\u201d during the recording sessions. So Van Halen III flops because the fans don\u2019t like it\u2026hell, the band probably didn\u2019t like it. Gary\u2019s the new guy and the only element that changed and therefore Gary, being the perceived bad egg, had to go. Gary became the scapegoat for lackluster sales of the album. Van Halen III clearly represents a regression in Van Halen songwriting. Van Halen\u2019s previous studio album with Hagar, \u2018Balance\u2019, showcases a more experimental Van Halen emerging. I really enjoyed \u2018Balance\u2019 and believed it to be, and believe it still is, a strong Van Halen album. All of the elements that made \u2018Balance\u2019 great\u2026the catchy chorus of \u2018Can\u2019t Stop Loving You\u2019, the heaviness of \u2018The Seventh Seal\u2019, and the virtuoso playing by Eddie on \u2018Feelin\u2019\u2026all of those elements are absent from Van Halen III. Writing this brings those memories back, working as a 20-something year old for a landscaping company. I had bought Van Halen III on cassette and was playing it through my walkman while riding a mower. I had probably listened to the album a few times at this point. I wanted to like it and tried to make myself like it. In the end, I accepted defeat and declared to myself it was a horrible Van Halen album\u2026even worse than \u2018Diver Down\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a few reasons. But the biggest reason, is Van Halen teased their fans with a short lived reunion with David Lee Roth just prior to Gary joining the band. They went so far with the publicity of the reunion, that they all got on stage at the 1996 MTV Music awards show, giving everybody the impression that they were definitely back together, and everybody was very excited about this. But unbeknownst to Dave, there were 2 other singers who thought they were the singer of Van Halen, all while this was going on. Along with Dave, Gary Cherone, and Mitch Malloy also thought they were in Van Halen. Somehow Gary and Mitch were in LA while the band flew to NYC for the awards show, and didn\u2019t know about the other. Eddie was playing all 3 singers. When Mitch saw them go on MTV with Dave, he wrote Eddie a letter of resignation, saying that they just made it super hard for any singer to be the new singer of Van Halen, and that they should continue with Dave. Very shortly after, Van Halen announced Gary as the new singer. He\u2019s a great singer with good presence, but he was far from being Dave. Furthermore, when they came out with VH3, the album didn\u2019t hold up very well to the others. They had a TV Producer producing the album, and the majority of the songs just weren\u2019t up to the Van Halen standards that the fanbase had expected. There was major disappointment with the fans and how the band went about their business. That pretty much sums it up ",
