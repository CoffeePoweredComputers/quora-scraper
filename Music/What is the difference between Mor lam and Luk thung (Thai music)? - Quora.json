            "answer_text": "Morlum will has a sense of traditional instruments, Luk Thung literally means Child of the field, so the lyrics is related to Child of the field life, it might be like I\u2019m poor girl from Isan and comes to work in Bangkok. Oh, Bangkok is so civilized, but I miss my serene hometown blah blah. Luk Thung sounds more modern but how they sing with Isan dialect and style made Luk Thung differs from other kinds of song. I will show you some examples and then you will know the differences. You need to listen to the melody. Sometimes Morlum and Luk Thung can be mixed! So, don\u2019t be serious. Actually, I think Thais these days count any songs that use Isan dialect as a Luk Thung. lol Morlum (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e25\u0e33) is Lao culture. The important instrument is Can (\u0e41\u0e04\u0e19). The original version will has one male and one female singers.  Morlum has many sub-genres. The modern one can be mixed with Western instruments.   Luk Thung was born in Bangkok after WWII.    Thai meme song - Jeehoy!! Luk Thung songs always give me an energy, these are some of my favs. Actually, the lyrics are nothing but its melody is good.   ",
