            "answer_text": "Q: What is the difference between hard rock music and soft rock music? A: \u201cSoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d are attempts to convey the difference between the overall feeling of the music, with \u201csoft\u201d indicating peaceful, soothing, serene, gentle, etc., and \u201chard\u201d indicating loud, aggressive, dissonant, perhaps even angry. Soft rock typically has slower tempos and an emphasis on acoustic instruments. Hard rock is often (though not always) more uptempo, with an emphasis on electric instruments (especially electric guitar), loud drumming, more energy, and more focus on instrumental solos and jamming. Lyrical themes are typically consistent with the overall different feel. Soft rock lyrics are often wistful, sometime sad, and often focus on relationships and love. Hard rock songs are quite likely to deal with more aggressive, combative, even ugly themes, though there can certain be plenty of overlap in lyrical themes between the two forms. Soft rock is epitomized by artists like James Taylor, Carole King, Seals & Crofts, Loggins & Messina, etc.. Hard rock is epitomized by artists like Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Alice Cooper, AC/DC, Deep Purple, etc. The examples I\u2019ve given reveal my age and bias towards music of a particular era. I\u2019m not sure to what degree the \u201csoft rock\u201d/\u201dhard rock\u201d terminology is commonly applied to rock and roll music of more recent vintage, but I\u2019m sure other answers will shed some light on that.

            "answer_text": "Both have changed over the years. Some more drastic than others. In the 60\u2019s, soft rock woulda been like Simon and Garfunkel, Crosby Stills & Nash, and The Grateful Dead, and The Beatles. By the 70\u2019s, Soft Rock was bands like The Eagles, Neil Young, and Bruce Springsteen, and Elton John. In the 80\u2019s, soft rock was more of what we now call \u201cPop Rock\u201d with artists like Kenny Loggins, Billy Joel, George Michael, The Cure, and still, Bruce Springsteen. The 90\u2019s really saw a continuation of the \u201cPop Rock\u201d tradition set in motion in the 80\u2019s. We saw bands like U2, REM, and Collective Soul. Today, soft rock carries on with bands like My Morning Jacket and Coldplay, and a whole swarm of \u201cIndie\u201d bands coming on the scene. Hard Rock has REALLY changed over the years. In the 60\u2019s it was artists like Jimi Hendrix, Santana, The Doors, The Who, and toward the end, Led Zeppelin. The 70\u2019s really saw a huge influx of hard rock bands. Black Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Queen, Aerosmith, AC/DC, and The Ramones. The 80\u2019s brought along a new flavor of hard rock with Guns n Roses hitting the charts along with Van Halen, Def Leppard, Motley Crue, and MANY more. After everyone was tired of the hairspray and spandex of the 80\u2019s, bands like Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails, and Soundgarden breaking into the grunge genre and the precursor to the 2000\u2019s Today, I don\u2019t think normal \u201cHard Rock\u201d is being made anymore except for the old artists still rockin. There are so many \u201cSub-genres\u201d nowadays. But the closest to the label \u201cHard Rock\u201d are bands like The Foo Fighters. Most \u201chard rock\u201d today is closer to metal than actual \u201chard rock\u201d. But then again, Black Sabbath is considered metal still. ",
