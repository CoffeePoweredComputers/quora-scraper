            "answer_text": "While I like all kinds of music, including new age (which is old age now!), country, Native American flute music, and Christian rock, the true soundtrack of my life, from growing up late 60\u2019s and through the 70\u2019s into the 80\u2019s, it\u2019d have to be bluesy guitar and soul rock, into soft rock, glam rock, hard rock, some disco/funk/dance, short-lived punk rock, metal rock and uniquely eclectic rock throughout. Beginning with Elvis, Janis Joplin, Hendrix, The Doors, onto Led Zep, Queen, Elton, Air Supply (yes, really) America, Boston, Kansas, Styx, Genesis, The Kinks, MJ, Prince, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi and with some good ol\u2019 Springsteen mixed in, plus a few more of course. But I\u2019d have to say the ONE ENDURING BAND (for me) which stands out and performed every single genre they ever took on to memorable perfection (and the original music I still listen to 50, 40 and 30 years later), IS QUEEN. With their ever-changing unique style, incredible talent (all 4 hit-writing songwriters and masters of their instruments), and the best voice and frontman in rock history, impossible to get tired of the original 4 playing together\u2026 EVER. LIAR, from 1974:  WHITE QUEEN, also 1974, though below is a 1975 performance:  SOMEBODY TO LOVE, 1976:  ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST, 1980, this below is 1981 & \u201982:  INNUENDO, 1991:  THE SHOW MUST GO ON, also 1991 (and for me, so it will; FOREVER. RIP, Freddie):  PLUS all the well-played, well-known hits most of the world already knows! Personally, I like their less-known compositions best. If you think you don\u2019t like Queen\u2019s harder rockin\u2019 hits, then take a listen to some of their other album tracks \u2026 might just change your mind. Here\u2019s just one: THE MILLIONAIRE\u201dS WALTZ, 1976, from their Day at the Races album:  ",

I consider that a soundtrack of my life because it's such fun when you listen to this genre and you can feel go somewhere just by listening to songs. My life is full of color and I like being kind of eccentric because I love trying something new in my new stage of life. Thank you very much for reading. ",
