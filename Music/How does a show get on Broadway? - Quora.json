            "answer_text": "Money... and a lot of it! I've never brought a show to the stage myself.  However, I have been on the advertising side of the business for a very long time.  This is how I understand the business to work fundamentally.   Anything you want can be brought to Broadway with enough money.  For the most part the Broadway theaters are all owned by just a few long time \"show business\" owners.  Discounting Disney who only produces its own shows in the venues it owns.   So, in the simplest of terms it works like this:  Lets say you have a show idea:  \"Four kids from Jersey make it big in the 50's.\"  Sounds like it could be a winner.  You talk to everyone you know.  You come up with maybe $500,000.  That gets you \"the Book\" and \"the Music\" and maybe \"a workshop\" or two.   The book is the story.  Not so much the script as it is the story.  The script will come later.  At this point you\"ll also need the music and lyrics.  None of that is any good unless you test that at some level of workshop theater (this cost more).    After all that is done; we divided the players from the want wish they were players.  If you have the right investors, if your book has the right names in its credits if you have the next level of funding.   A word on how Broadway is paid.  Everyone is paid on Friday.  It's up to the producers of the show to have the money on hand on Friday to pay the cast, the stage hands the advertising, the house the list goes on.  There is no credit on Broadway, everyone is paid on Friday. If you have all of the right stuff you can bid for a venue that may be coming available.  This is very competitive, Broadway theaters are rented by the owners to show produces by the day.  The owners don't care how many seats are sold or what the costs are or any of that...  They what to be paid on Friday, so it is in their interest to try to pick shows that are likely to run the longest in their houses.  If you are new and not well funded, it is very hard save imposable (thus off Broadway).   With the right concept, the right book, investors, and a show that has done well in workshop or on the road you too can be \"On Broadway\"   I can tell you this for sure there is nothing cooler than your own name in lights on great white way. That's an overview, if you need to know more write me directly. Bill ",

            "answer_text": "A producer who is able to raise a lot of money has a \u2018feeling\u2019 about a script, rents a Broadway theater and hires a director. Fewer and fewer new plays open on Broadway now because the gamble is too great. It is safer to put on Oklahoma, or The King and I, or Peter Pan, perennial favorites that always bring in audiences, rather than risk the cost of a mansion on Martha\u2019s Vineyard on a new, untried work that might be genius but go unappreciated. This is a serious theatrical aphorism: No one ever lost money reviving Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Importance of Being Ernest. The play is so well written that a disastrous performance by incompetent actors is sometimes funnier than a production of actors highly skilled in restoration comedy. When in doubt put on Ernest, unless you\u2019re confident you have the next Hamilton. If you\u2019ve ever seen Mel Brooks\u2019 1967 movie, The Producers, that is a pretty fair description of how a Broadway show gets produced. ",
