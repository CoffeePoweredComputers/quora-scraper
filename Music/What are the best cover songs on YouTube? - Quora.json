            "answer_text": "This. Space Oddity  The iconic song \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d by David Bowie has been recreated beautifully by Chris Austin Hadfield, who is a retired Canadian astronaut. Chris Hatfield is the first Canadian to walk on space and the first Canadian to command the International Space Station.Hadfield launched in the Soyuz TMA-07M flight for a long duration stay on board the ISS as part of Expedition 35, during which he paid a fitting tribute to the Starman by recording a cover of \u201cSpace Odyssey\u201d which is amazing due to the fact that he actually recorded it in space adding real depth and meaning to the amazing lyrics. Bowie himself said that the \"Space Oddity\" cover was \"possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created.\"Well, can't argue with Starman, can we ? ",

These are my personal favourite covers!: Locked Away-Kurt Hugo Schneider, Sam Tsui, Kirsten Collins: Kurt Hugo Schneider! He is the most fun man I have seen! Ever! The way he mixes and adds a new fresh view to the songs! Beautiful! 2. Let It Go-James Bay cover by Joshua Mallik: Saw this guy\u2019s first cover and immediately fell in love with his voice and the way he plays and sings feeling the song! God!  3. Can\u2019t help falling in love- Twenty One Pilots: The singer is so cute and sings so soulfully! Takes my heart away! Very natural <3 :)  ",
