            "answer_text": "I've tried them all (and actually used 5 of them in and out\u2026no easy feat) and if it's relative to the Apple prima Donna, then there really are only 3 DAWs that compare to Logic Pro in terms of workflow, depth, and capabilites: Steinberg\u2019s Cubase Pro Cakewalk\u2019 s Sonar Platimum Avid\u2019s Pro Tools Honorable Mentions to MOTU\u2019s Digital Performer and Cocko\u2019s Reaper. Sure, Ableton Live and Studio One and Mixcraft and Sequoia and Bitwig and Tracktion are good and definitely capable DAWs (though probably more in the box than out)\u2026and sure, LMMS and Audiacity are free and capable in their own rights, too\u2026 \u2026but if you need the flexibility to be able to record and process live audio, mix it with vsti midi tracks and loops, and then also control and sequence live hardware synthesizers, drum machines, samplers, and effects units and then mix, master, and render product in variable file formats to various sources without turning to another piece of software or rely on somebody else, those 3 (or 5) packages are your best bet. If you're only working in the box, then you probably aren't using Logic Pro now, anyway, and I'd tell you to stick with Ableton (which you're almost certainly using). It's the same story as above with Ableton, except if you're 12, then use FL studio. If you are completely terrified of computers but can produce the hell out of a hardware rig, then sure\u2026go ahead and use Reason. Otherwise, Cubase, Sonar, Pro Tools (and maybe Digital Performer and Reaper) are your best bets. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve wondered this for years. For context, the last version I used was Logic Pro 7, which must seem hilariously outdated these days. Out of curiosity, I got my hands on Logic 4 I believe it was, the last version of Logic to appear in Windows. It was infuriatingly slow. Whether that was because of the age of the software, it not liking Windows 10, or a combination of many factors, I\u2019m unsure. Frankly, I didn\u2019t want to hang around with it long enough to figure it out. These days, I\u2019ve gone for the cheaper solutions. If you\u2019re also looking to keep costs down, Audacity and Reaper are the ones I\u2019ve plumped for. That being said, Audacity is fairly limited, so I\u2019d only recommend this if you want to go for something free and use it simply for tracking, looping and snipping. Reaper on the other hand is my little love. I mostly record, so don\u2019t really need much in the way of sampling or anything like that. I haven\u2019t really looked into this side, but I don\u2019t think there is MIDI programming capabilities. If there are, by all means let me know. I\u2019d be especially interested in using this if it resembles Logic\u2019s Matrix Editor. This leads me on to the other program I have: PreSonus Studio One. Again, being a cheap bastard, I only have the free version. However, even for something free, it has a wealth of tools at your disposal, so you could do a hell of a lot worse. This does have something like the matrix editor, as far as I can see, but it doesn\u2019t feel as user-friendly to me as Logic 7\u2019s did. I\u2019ve had a little bit of experience with Reason and FL Studio, but they\u2019re ones I just couldn\u2019t get on with. I\u2019m a creature of habit, so I like having a familiar feel. If you\u2019re unwilling to spend a lot of money, I would plump for Reaper for sure, and maybe get Guitar Pro as well if you fancy adding MIDI tracks either into the song or as a ghost instrumentalist to keep you in time.
