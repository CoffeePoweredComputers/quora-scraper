            "answer_text": "Why, yes, sire By my definition: \u201cart is everything done with aesthetics in mind\u201d, i.e. \u201ceverything done thinking on how it\u2019s going to be perceived\u201d. A tree can be beautiful, but it\u2019s not art. A picture of a tree, though, is art, unless it\u2019s an accidental photo (e.g. you clicked the shutter by accident). Note also that \u201cgoing to be perceived\u201d includes being perceived by whoever does it, not necessarily someone else. But let\u2019s go on\u2026 There\u2019s art in my computer. The colors and overall design are an art process, because they were made thought on how they\u2019d be perceived. They\u2019re aesthetic elements. But the computer in its entirety is not an art piece, because it\u2019s not just aesthetical, it\u2019s essentialy practical. Heavy Metal is music, thus it\u2019s art Simple, right? Because music is basically perception of sound. So anytime someone intentionally makes music, this someone is making art. Sometimes an accidental organization of sounds might be considered music, but that very rarely happens and depends then entirely on the listener considering it music or not. Some bands can be more \u201cartsy\u201d than others, though. Take, for example, a Behemoth clip and song. It\u2019s Metal (check), it has an aesthetic thought all over it (check), it is not practical/usable (check), it is not accidental at all (check) and it is very \u201ccomplex and kvlt\u201d (check?). It feels like a work of art, like the one done by a 50 y/o professional artist and not a teenager who sketches in class.But the sketch it also art, isn\u2019t it? Take a Sarc\u00f3fago song now. It has an aesthetic thought all over it (check), it is not practical/usable (check), it is not accidental (maybe some parts are, though) (check?) and it is not very \u201ccomplex and kvlt\u201d at all. It\u2019s actually very immature and raw, a true WIP that someone released. It feels very sketchy. Most songs sound just like demos.With this you can say \u201cBehemoth is more artsy than Sarc\u00f3fago\u201d, but that\u2019s the same as saying \u201cDali is more artsy than me\u201d. Of course it is, but that\u2019s not about attempt, it\u2019s about skill and dedication. It\u2019s about whether it\u2019s art or not, or being \u201cmore art\u201d (because that doesn\u2019t exist), it\u2019s about quality. And you can like your sketches and not like anything Dali did, that doesn\u2019t change the fact Dali had a lot more skill and experience and all his works are highly valued pieces of art. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is considered an art form. let me explain you about the brief history of heavy metal then you can decide on your own. Someone unfamiliar with the heavy metal genre would be forgiven for feeling a little bit confused upon first listen. How is heavy metal different from traditional rock music? What is death metal? What's with all the talk about the devil and fighting dragons? These are all fair questions that will be clarified in this lesson. Heavy metal first emerged in England and the United States in the early 1970s as a natural outgrowth of the rock music of the time. While hard rock artists like Led Zeppelin, the Who, and Jimi Hendrix were pushing the envelope in terms of guitar amplification and on-stage antics, their music was still very much indebted to the blues and earlier forms of rock music. Black Sabbath is widely considered to be the first true heavy metal band. Through the use of darker musical tones, religious lyrical themes, and a slow, crushing heaviness to their sound, Black Sabbath created the template for an entirely new genre of rock music. While many other genres of popular music attempt to talk about real-life experiences, love, or politics, heavy metal is famous for dealing with religious and supernatural metaphors. Black Sabbath's singer Ozzy Osbourne wrote lyrics about occult ceremonies and unspeakable monsters, but he was using these images as metaphors to talk about war and alienation. Heavy Metal Subculture By the late 1970s, a new generation of bands would take inspiration from Black Sabbath's menacing sound, while speeding up the tempo and continuing to distance themselves from the blues roots of rock. Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead from England, as well as Scorpions from Germany, added speed and intensity to Black Sabbath's sound. Music journalists started using the term heavy metal to describe the new approach. In the large industrial cities of England, heavy metal developed very much in tandem with the punk movement, which was creating moral outrage throughout the United Kingdom. It borrowed the speed and nihilism of punk, leather, and denim from outlaw biker culture, and a fascination with occultism drawn from horror films and Black Sabbath. With that, heavy metal came together in the late 1970s as not just a distinct musical genre, but as a fully formed subculture. The 1980s: The Golden Age of Heavy Metal and the Rise of Extreme Metal The 1980s saw an explosion in the popularity, musical development, and geographic spread of heavy metal. The early 1980s produced a movement within England called the New Wave of British Heavy Metal led by bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Diamond Head. The blues base that characterized virtually all earlier forms of rock music was now almost undetectable. The New Wave of British Heavy Metal was defined by high, wailing vocals, two harmonizing electric guitars, and themes concerning rebellion, Satanism, and the occult. The popularity of heavy metal spread in North America and Europe, filling stadiums and outraging conservative parents. During the huge upsurge of heavy metal's popularity in the 1980s, the subculture that had formed around the music began to fragment into different scenes and subgenres. More accessible, pop-friendly bands like Def Leppard, Van Halen, and Twisted Sister wrote catchy, radio-friendly songs combined with flashy, often gender-bending costumes, creating a subgenre known as glam metal. At the same time, many bands started taking heavy metal in increasing experimental, dark, and thematically provocative directions, partially in reaction to the radio-friendly metal bands that they saw as sellouts. Venom from England, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, and Hellhammer from Switzerland expressed overtly satanic lyrics and played music that was more extreme and intense than anything previously heard. In California, heavy metal musicians started playing even faster than their British peers, creating the subgenre thrash metal. Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth were at the forefront of this movement. Thrash, in combination with the extreme metal developing in Europe, would usher in a split within heavy metal subculture between the mainstream metal and extreme metal factions. ",
