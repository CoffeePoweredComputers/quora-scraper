Or what intention? About this movie, we just think what a culturally egocentric beings. Besides, it doesn't have a meaningful story lines, and the actor is even not Kazakh , so we don't give a fuck about this movie. But if someone still want to know Kazakhstan or Kazakh people through this movie , then I am gonna ask you how long you haven't read a book about this world? Well then you need to update your world culture knowledges by reading or watching some real books and movies. ",

Just because they heard that most of people in Kazakhstan are Muslim, they assume that Kazakhstan is like Saudi Arabia. One lesson for you guys, never EVER try to learn anything with American movies, you will just get ignorant with that. ",
