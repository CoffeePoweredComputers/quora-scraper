            "answer_text": "He neither converted nor sang any songs like Islam In my veins. He was a Jehovah witness all his life. Just like so many rumors about him, it was one of those rumors, he wasn't gay, he never slept into an oxygen chamber, his children completely belong to him biologically and he never converted into Islam. The islamic songs which are famous as Michael Jackson sang in his final years after converting. No he never sang those songs. There are so many false informations about it, don't believe it. The song which is allegedly sung by Michael Jackson is actually sung by a singer named irfan makki. His voice is very similar to Michael Jackson but hear it closely you'll understand that his voice is different he sings in a same way. And in his song \u201cI believe\u201d you can easily detect difference between his and Michael's voice. The song \u201c Islam in my veins\u201d is a really soothing song. But give credit to irfan makki who sung it very beautifully , not Michael Jackson he has his own records for phenomenal songs. ",
