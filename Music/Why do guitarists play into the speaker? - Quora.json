            "answer_text": "As previously stated, these guitarists are trying to generate feedback for musical purposes. In the early days of electric guitar pickups, many if not most pickups were quite micro phonic and would squeal if the player faced the amp and the amp was cranked up pretty high. Pickup makers learned they could \"pot\" the pickups in wax--essentially putting the new pickup into a pot of melted wax. The wax works it's way in between the coils of wire that wrap around and around the inside of the pickup, filling in air gaps and anchoring the wires do they cannot vibrate. Wax also seals the spaces between the magnets and the pickup body and may also fill gaps between the pickup and it's cover (of it has one). The result is a pickup that has no or greatly reduced micro phonic qualities. For a guy like Kimi Hendrix, this would be bad, because he counted on the microphonic feedback from his pickups.It is much more difficult to get that feedback with modern pickups, so some of us pickup makers make \"vintage\" style pickups with no potting. This allows a more open sound to the pickup and, of course, allows that fun and freaky feedback! ",
