            "answer_text": "Eddie was very fluid in his Solos and didn\u2019t really need the tremelo bar to be great . He had very creative rhythm Guitar voicings and very tight timing ( I was surprised when I saw him on a video playing \u2018live \u2018 ) . I at first underestimated him just from hearing him on the radio . He was actually a kind of progressive Rock/ Fusion Guitarist in many ways . He took the * \u2018 tapping \u2018 thing further than most Guitarists but still may have been great without it. If you listen to his amazing solo on Beat It - he sounds really a lot like a wailing Jazz Saxophone Player playing R&B ..the timing and syncopation ( accent upbeats sometimes ) and the kind of Classical Violin Virtuoso thing that solo has make it much more listenable and interesting . Many of us can play that fast or faster now , but that solo has a Musical Vibe - total drama ( IMO ) it\u2019s perfectly within the Song - it fits the groove but goes further . He also did some really pretty atmospheric things for the Movie , \u2018Twister \u2018 during the ending credits which don\u2019t sound like him - a different side - which we probably would have heard more of as he got older \u2026\u2026 *The late great Michael Hedges did a lot of tapping on Acoustic Guitar and there\u2019s a very creative set of Players on Acoustic following in Hedges steps today . I don\u2019t tap but in 2021 you will hear some 5 fingers Playing from me that emulates that complexity ( sounding like 2 Guitars at once sometimes, going for 3 lol ) using advanced picking techniques recently developed. I call what I do \u2018 pianoguitar \u2018 . Spell check hates this word lol. ",

            "answer_text": "Written by a guitarist on Quora What influence did Eddie Van Halen have on the electric guitar? There has never been a guitar player quite like Eddie Van Halen.When Van Halen's eponymous debut hit the shelves in February of 1978 (the band rounded out with Eddie's brother, Alex on drums, Micheal Anthony, and David Lee Roth), the prevailing rock guitar sound and scene was unexpectedly hit with something of seismic proportion. The fire and fury that was Edward's playing, the fluid legato runs, the white hot pentatonics, tremolo picking, screaming artificial harmonics, whammy tricks and dive bombs, volume swells, choppy flanges, his uniquely original other-worldly two handed tapping, all at top modded-Marshall volume, drenched in reverb, his unique \u2018brown\u2019 sound\u2026 Eddie took over where the imaginations of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix had left off, he took everything that rock guitar was known to be and he flipped it on its\u2019 head - smiling his inimitable smile, making it look easy the entire time.
