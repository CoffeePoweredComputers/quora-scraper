            "answer_text": "\u2018Powderfinger\u2019 paints a scenario that could be a possibility in a once free society: \u201cthe powers that be\u201d coming after folks that they didn\u2019t want to exist Don\u2019t know why the family on the river drew the wrath of a possible fascist state. It\u2019s fiction, so while the story may never occur; the fact that someone would be confronted with a state\u2019s war against their own people is reality. Anyway, the song is very melodic, and fits hand-in-glove with the lyrics. If you haven\u2019t listened to it, then please do. Those who have, will probably have the same take on it as I have. Along, with \u2018Thrasher\u2019 and other songs on \u2018Rust Never Sleeps\u2019, there\u2019s plenty of powerful lyrics that are well-matched with the music. ",
