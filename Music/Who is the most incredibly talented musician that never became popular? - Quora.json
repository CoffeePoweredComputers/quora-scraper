            "answer_text": "T hat\u2019s pretty subjective, but one of the best singer songwriters, who wrote a lot of hits for other artists, but never really became big herself was:  Laura Nyro wrote songs that became hits for Three Dog Night,Blood Sweat and Tears, The 5th dimension, and Barbra Streisand. She was very talented, and a great singer herself, as well as a great Pianist. She never really wanted to be a big star and suffered from stage fright, preferring to play small clubs rather than Stadiums, She died fairly young at age 49. taken from us way too early. I always though she should have been more widely recognized. ",
