            "answer_text": "\u201cWar of Hormone\u201d, \u201cAugust D\u201d(Yoongi), \u201cExpensive Girl\u201d (Namjoon), \u201cJoke\u201d (Namjoon) and \u201cTrouble\u201d (Namjoon and Jin) are probably some of the most explicit. Not gonna lie I actually think all of these songs are a bop (yes even expensive girl) and I listen to them still to this day. So the first time I actually read the lyrics to \u201cWar of Hormone\u201d (which was a long time after I had first heard it) I was pretty shocked lol. I\u2019ll never forget Jungkook\u2019s line where he goes \u201cGirls are like equations and us guys just do them\u201d and I was like oh ok cool. Like lmao it was so unexpected and I didn\u2019t know how to react. Yeah, the song doesn\u2019t have a great meaning behind it and they\u2019re basically objectifying girls but this was a few years back where they didn\u2019t have as much control over the music they sang. \u201cExpensive Girl\u201d was definitely the worst lmaoo I remember having to shut my laptop off and having to actually comprehend what the fuck I had just listened to, but honestly that song grew on me and I liked it adjakls. \u201cAgust D\u201d is a jam ok I know there\u2019s all that \u201ctongue technology\u201d stuff but we live for that honestly, like you can tell Yoongs is really confident in his tongue, but doesn\u2019t have every right to be lol. Oof ok, \u201cTrouble\u201d this song only kinda scarred me. Just a tad though. Joon takes the lead for most of the sexual references, Jin kinda just singing a long in the background but nonetheless he was still apart of it. That song is actually pretty good too so like it\u2019s fine ahaha. \u201cJoke\u201d is like crazy. There\u2019s a lot happening in that song, but it\u2019s not really that bad besides the cussing (which I don\u2019t mind at all). But he does rap about porn and stuff (for like 2 secs), so it is considered inappropriate. Ok, but all jokes aside these songs were made a while ago, especially \u201cExpensive Girl\u201d, \u201cTrouble\u201d, And \u201cWar of Hormone\u201d so any new army please don\u2019t try to bring up any questions about these songs, especially \u201cExpensive Girl\u201d. Idk it\u2019d be super weird and uncomfortable for Namjoon if you ask him about it, it was awhile ago and he\u2019s grown so much and knows so much more. Same goes for all of them, they\u2019ve grown a tremendous amount and have really learned how to treat women. Like they don\u2019t even give a full hug when hugging women because they think it\u2019s disrespectful. Cut them some slack, please, Korea is not America and they\u2019re still learning, don\u2019t hold what stupid shit they say like three or four years ago against them. ",

            "answer_text": "OH i have a pretty unpopular opinion here, converse high is, in my opinion a REALLY dirty song. the vocal parts are alright, they\u2019re pretty cute and sound like a normal boygroup song: \u201cI'm so into your Converse Highs I can't help it, woah I'm so into your Converse Highs I like it so much, woah\u201d alright, a little weird to be singing about shoes like that but considering namjoons love for converse at the time, it\u2019s understandable. but then we get to the rap parts and it starts getting dirtier. Alright, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet The rainbow on your feet is shot like Rambo It aims at me, bang bang, shout out wow wow Together with your body makes me go hakhak Super-taxi, super-cycle, super-subway No, thanks, I wanna ride the super-bus Rather than the stars in the sky I wanna see the stars on your shoes Haha, without Namjoon knowing okay, now this is where it gets a bit weird. in Korean, the hakhak sound effect is more like a bangbang. so when he says when i\u2019m with your body i go bangbang without namjoon knowing, so he\u2019s basically talking about um. doing unholy things to namjoon\u2019s girl without him knowing. Converse, Converse, I really hate a Converse When you look flashy with your black stockings And your high heels. That's just a lie But you look better with Jordan numbers Ha don't you know? Converses kill your charm Anyway when you meet me, don't wear Converses It's too hard to take them off of you do i even have to explain? yoongi\u2019s talking about taking clothes off this converse-wearing girl to do. things. bts had tons of rlly strange songs like that, but they\u2019re also lyrical geniuses and that\u2019s important to remember hahaha ",
