            "answer_text": "The best book unfortunately not well known I ever perused but never used as an undergraduate freshman in 1967\u20131968 was Calculus of One Variable by Joseph W. Kitchen(1968)! The probably unique \u201cOne Variable\u201d in the title among the hundreds for a century would suggest that it stands out. This is a high quality Calculus text! The definitions and material were more in keeping with modern formulations of the last 30 years and presented at a graduate school level of that era but still very readable for a first time student well grounded in pre-Calculus and elementary high school math courses certainly moreso for an upper echelon math major. It was way ahead of its time! You could say it was a bit advanced nonetheless it was and is excellent for a very bright student! A little above \u201cmiddle\u201d level book, which we didn't use in my undergraduate freshman days, for a first time non-high school Calculus student is Calculus With Analytic Geometry by Richard E. Johnson and F. L. Kiokemeister also from the 1960s but much much much less sophisticated than Kitchen's, not in the best category, but can be described as very good and above average from the \u201cstone ages\u201d. It is the only beginner's Calculus book or any book I have ever seen that contains the glossed over but pivotal, fundamental, critical, basic, essential, implied but never stated: If f:W\u2014>R, g:W-->R, R the reals and f(x)=g(x) for all x in W(the reals), except for x=k in W, having the Limit f(x) as x\u2192k exist => Limit f(x) as x\u2192k=Limit g(x) as x\u2192k. (This is my \u201cisomorphic\u201d version not what appears in their book). Seems trivial but it is absolutely indispensable for if we didn't have it there would be no Calculus for most mappings need to be reduced or augmented to a better form to find its limit! The most famous book of the mid 1960s was Calculus with Analytic Geometry A First Course by Murray H. Protter and Charles Bradfield Morry, Jr. both from U. C. Berkeley. It was the second best selling text in the U.S.! We didn't use it in my Calculus classes. However Professor D. M. Bloom(Ph.D. Harvard in abstract algebra, but didn\u2019t teach there) from my university used it. He was reported to be a perfect teacher in all undergraduate math subjects(I never took any courses with him). The fact that it was so well regarded including by Professor Bloom would indicate that this book was top notch. What distinguished it also was that integration was presented first which I personally disagree with and feel is unnatural and not the way I think it should be taught to students new to the Calculus whether in high school or college.(I learned it with differentiation first). If we\u2019re to judge by what arguably one of the five best mathematicians of the first third of the 20th century Godfrey Harold Hardy(of England) said that he fully appreciated analysis when he read and self-studied probably in his twenties the book by Camille Jordan: Cours d'analyse de l'Ecole Polytechnique(1882\u20131887). It is in French and unfortunately no English translation to date. If someone of Hardy's caliber praises this it must be supreme! However this is unquestionably only for superior math students who can read French. A Course of Pure Mathematics(1908) by G. H. Hardy himself is an outstanding classic probably second after Jordan's work of about 135 years ago. A superb text from the mid-1990s by James Stewart of McMaster University and University of Toronto is Calculus: Early Transcendentals. It is a large book about a foot long in length with over 1000 pages. This is in the same league as Kitchen's with many wonderful applied real world examples from many fields not just physics; it's at a higher level than Protter and Morrey's book. Written no doubt for entering freshmen without spoon feeding or coddling where all prerequisites for this first course in Calculus must be met in high school and no remedial classes available at high caliber places of learning and therefore others attending a different near or same level quality higher institution should be readied in a parallel way! It is so good that basically you don't need your professor or his graduate school teaching assistant! You can do it on your own! Finally I want to mention Khan's Academy the videos and books if he has any: worthless at all levels from Calculus to his very elementary algebra high school material, etc.(If the purported strides were really there we'd see tens of millions of accomplished students which we haven't and certainly his program would have been implemented immediately in the U.S. high school and college system as well as in Europe, Asia and elsewhere!; similarly the \u201cNew Math\u201d failure of my generation about 1/2 century ago or the nonsense \u201chooked on phonics\u201d 25 years ago to improve the deplorable state of reading!). Khan himself I'm sure is an excellent Ph.D. mathematician from Stanford but I see nothing of teaching value from his presentation. Bill Gates I think touted it for his kids when they were younger. He's not one to judge a lowly Harvard dropout specializing in detestable boring programming and computer software(inspite of his then perfect 800 math SAT score!) It goes without saying that all of the above are not pre-Calculus works. They are for students at better 4 year universities. The best Calculus books are definitely needed and are an advantage but they will not nor have they created a sudden upsurge of students understanding this admittedly difficult and esoteric discipline! It definitely requires an above average intelligence and alot of persistence! ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with books like Thomas\u2019 Calculus or Stewart Calculus is that you won\u2019t get a thorough understanding of the inner mechanics of calculus. As long as you don\u2019t have a good prof or teacher, I would stay away from these books. If you want to understand what I mean, take a look at some arbitrary sections in these books. You\u2019ll see a short paragraph, which serves as an intro, then some boxes with formulas, then a few workout examples and then a bunch of exercises. This means, you will only learn HOW to you the formulas instead of understanding the WHY! My advice is, visit YouTube, search for Michael Van Biezen, learn the techniques of Calculus 1\u20133 (ca. 17 hours), and then, to understand the inner mechanics of Calculus, read Tom Apostol. Biezen will serve as a shortcut for learning the techniques and Apostol will teach you the WHY. Alternatively you can search for Prof.Leonard on YouTube and watch his Calculus 1\u20133 lectures (ca 168 hours). He works through the books like Stewart Calculus but tries to teach you the sections in detail. Nevertheless, I would prefer the first way Biezen -> Apostol. To answer your question, Gilbert Strang - Calculus (very good, but in my opinion to conversational. You can find it for free on the website of MIT)Tom Apostol - Calculus (very very good, but you need to put in serious effort)Michael Spivak (didn\u2019t read it, but many people say, it\u2019s quite harder than Apostol, but still one of the best books to learn Calculus, although only Single Variable Calculus)Serge Lang - First Course in Calculus (makes fun to read it, built more on intuition)Thomas\u2019 Calculus (short on explanations and too dry)Stewart Calculus (same as Thomas\u2019 with the exception, that he has more real world examples)If you don\u2019t want to buy a hardcopy you can get a comprehensive Calculus book from OpenStax where Gilbert Strang is one of the Authors. (see link below).I hope I could help you. I struggled a lot with the same question. OpenStax ",
