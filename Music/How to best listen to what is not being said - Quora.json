            "answer_text": "Nietzsche wrote that his books were written for those people \u201cwho have ears behind their ears.\u201d Theodore Reik wrote that being a good psychoanalyst/psychotherapist required developing and then \u201cListening With the Third Ear.\u201d (This was the title of his best known book.) Most of the time, we have an agenda when we converse with another. This agenda prevents our being fully present in these situations, whether we are in dialogue with one other person or participating in a group discussion. Rather than being present, we usually wait for the other/s to shut up so that we can say what\u2019s in our mind. So the simplest way to listen to what is not being said is to get rid of the agenda. (Recall that \u201csimple\u201d is not a synonym for \u201ceasy.\u201d) One way to do this is to enter each conversation as an encounter, one that you enter \u201cwithout desire, memory, or understanding.\u201d (This is from Robert Langs\u2019 books on psychoanalytic psychotherapy. In my opinion, there\u2019s not a hair\u2019s breadth of difference between this technique for achieving evenly hovering attention and phenomenology.) Doing this takes practice, and it\u2019s easier if you have an experienced teacher. But I developed the rudiments of this by immersing myself in novels, plays, stories and poems, and this should suffice if you want to be a better listener in your daily life. Or you could follow Nietzsche\u2019s advice and read his \u201cThus Spoke Zarathustra\u201d and follow it up with his \u201cBeyond Good and Evil.\u201d After reading both, try to make explicit how the latter \u201csays the same thing as [his] \u2018Zarathustra\u2019, only very differently.\u201d Or another option is to read Reik\u2019s book, or the chapter on phenomenology in \u201cExistence,\u201d by Rollo May, Ernst Angel and Henri Ellenberger (or another introduction to phenomenology). I have been doing this kind of listening for so many years that it has become habitual; but I started out by reading well, then followed up with Nietzsche, Reik, phenomenology, and Langs, pretty much in that order. Crucially, I also had experienced teachers as well, starting with my 7th grade English teacher and continuing into my professional life, when my colleagues and patients were also my teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "You pay attention to body language and if their movement matches what they are talking about. Are they making eye contact? Are you listening without interrupting and paying close attention to everything they do, say, and act. They may hint at things and you have to sense what they are not saying. It's all watching and listening. ",
