            "answer_text": "Your biggest concern will be replacing the retainer springs, everything else will pretty much be self explanatory. So do this. Change one wheel at a time. After you get the wheel and brake drum off, take a picture of what the brake assembly looks like before you do anything else. Later, you might be glad you did. Lay a big piece of cardboard or something on the ground in front of you. As you remove parts set them on the cardboard according to their orientation, and in the same order you took them off. This is your \u2018map\u2019 to put them back on. Now the springs, the tricky part. The easy way to get them off is to grab the straight section with locking pliers (vicegrips) and pull or push the hookend off of the stob. (don't worry, you'll see) When you get that end free don't just go ahead and take the spring off. The way the spring is oriented it kind of twists and turns it's way off, and it will need to twist and turn it's way back on. To end up right, it has to start out right. And it's real easy to forget, or not pay enough attention to how it came off. So before unhooking the other end from the brake shoe, convince yourself that you know how the spring goes back on. Try it a few times, be certain you know how it goes back on. Because it seems backwards and upside down, and it's a lot like counter-intuative to someone who doesn't change brake shoes every day. The other spring isn't the same, so you'll have to do it all over again when you get around to it. The good news is, if you do forget or something there's a correctly assembled brake on the other side of the car you can look at. The brake shoes have two keepers, they're springs too with metal caps on the outer ends. To remove them you'll need a pair of common pliers. Grab around the outside of the metal cap and push in to compress the spring. While holding turn the cap a half turn to line up the slot in the cap, and ease the spring back off. The cap should come off, the spring comes right off easily. At the bottom between the ends of the brake shoes is a \u2018star' on a screw. It's part of a mechanism that adjusts the brake shoes in and out. Since the new shoes are new, normally you'll need to adjust it inward to get the brake drums back on. Later, after your finished with everything else your brakes will need final adjustment. There's a tool called a spoon that inserts into a slot on the back side of the wheel that the star can be turned with. Or, you can do it the easy way. Get your car going in reverse about five miles an hour, and slam the brakes on to stop. Do this two or three times, or until you're satisfied. The star mechanism is self adjusting, and that's how it works. That should be all the help you need, the rest is pretty obvious. The retainer springs are the critical part, that's where everybody has the most difficulty. Just make sure everything goes back the same way it came off. Changing brake shoes is one of those things that is easier to show somebody how to do than telling them. I have learned that today. In actuality it's not as difficult as I've probably made it sound. But there are two or three things that are critical, that are also easy to make a mistake on. Good luck, I hope this answer is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually the biggest problem is getting the drum off. that is because it has worn and there is a lip at the edge of the drum. If you cannot get the drum to come off you may have to go from the back side to loosen the adjuster to give more clearance between the brake shoes and the drum. there are a few springs that need to be reinstalled in the correct position so I would strongly recommend that you take a few pictures when you get the drum off before you start disassembling anything. having a special tool to remove and reinstall the springs will make the job much easier. make sure you only do one side at a time and compare them before you start on the second side. make sure while you have the brake drums off that you never step on the break pedal. if the drum is OK without grooves in it or too much wear you will be able to reuse it. you should take it to the parts store to have them measure the size of the drum to make sure it is not worn too much. I would strongly recommend that you wear a mask while you are doing this job because even though they may not use asbestos anymore you do not want to be breathing that dust. use something like a white lithium grease to lubricate the back plate where the brake shoes rub.
