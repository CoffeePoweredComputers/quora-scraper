John sings \u201ccome on\u201d at least 13 times, before repeating any verse and/or chorus. Towards the end you can hear singing \u201ccome on, come on\u201d over and over again, gradually faster until you can barely understand what he is singing.  ",

            "answer_text": "I could tell you of one song which has \"Come On, Come On\" sung repeatedly at an increasing tempo, although there is much more to the song than that, but the singer is seriously persona non grata in several countries. In the UK just saying his name in public without spitting immediately afterwards is liable to get you a visit from your local version of the sex crimes and/or child protection police squad(s). Oh all right... here it is. Keep quiet about it and whatever you do, never, ever, let on where you got it from.  ",
