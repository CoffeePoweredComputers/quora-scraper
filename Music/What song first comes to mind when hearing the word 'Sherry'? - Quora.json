Oh Sherrie is an old, fairly mediocre 80s tune that was popular for a while. Steve Perry has a phenomenal singing voice - it\u2019s too bad he wasted it on this song. I don\u2019t particularly like this song, but it\u2019s the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw the name \u201cSherry\u201d. Also, I realize the spelling is different, but it\u2019s still the same name! :) ",
