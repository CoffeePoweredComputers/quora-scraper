            "answer_text": "Well, if you a Korean, then the company will make you go School of Performing Arts(SOPA) where many k-pop idols goBut they are only allowed to go once in a week or once in a month.You can give exams, but you need to self-study as you are only going once a week.But if you are not a Korean, then they will make you go to a international school in Seoul.But I don\u2019t think they will wait for you cause if they do, then their whole plan of your debut will be unsuccessful.You can take 1\u20132 week leaveBut I don\u2019t think that they will waitThen your debut will be postponed because companies will make you practice as a trainee as per their planHope this helped!!!
