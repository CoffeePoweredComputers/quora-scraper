            "answer_text": "After some thought, I came to the idea that Jooheon from Monsta X would be a good addition to the group. But then someone else posted that and I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was copying, so I gave it some more thought. And some more. And a bit more. And I concluded that another great addition would be NCT Yuta.   Not only does he give me \u201cATEEZ vibes,\u201d but he\u2019s a very talented rapper, singer, and dancer. He would fit in well. His dance skills are up to par with ATEEZ (maybe better), and he would be ready for their complicated choreographies since NCT has quite difficult choreographies as well. ATEEZ would be a good place for him to shine a little more with rapping and singing since he doesn\u2019t always have the opportunity to do that with 127 (at least on most title tracks). His voice has a sound that could meld well with the rest of ATEEZ, and he\u2019s a pretty solid mid-tone rapper. He doesn\u2019t really rap with a higher voice like Joong but also doesn\u2019t rap with a low voice like Mingi. He could be a good medium. But overall, I think that Yuta would be a very interesting addition that could work well with ATEEZ as a group as well as with their music. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Jooheon ( From Monsta X ). Well since they already got some nice vocals. Especially Jongho ( Love his voice! ) I think I will prefer to add a stronger rapper to the group. I know that Hongjoong and Mingi aren\u2019t bad but still they need to improve a lot. So I think that I would love it if Jooheon joins them. This guy has pretty lit skills at rapping ( and is one of the top 3 Kpop rappers in my opinion ) besides I think that his personality and style will fit well with the other Ateez members since he also has the badass, kinda dark aura but in reality a funny and chill type of guy.
