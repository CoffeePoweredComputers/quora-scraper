            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure everyone will have somewhat of a different opinion here as to what constitutes a great vocal. What always amazed me is the fact that John always hated the sound of his own voice and wanted effects added to it to change the sound. Personally I\u2019d kill to have his voice. I can\u2019t say for certain these are his 5 best but they are 5 I really like. Twist and Shout  Dear Pruedence  Most may not agree but I love the vocals on the Ballad of John and Yoko  In My My Life  My final pick may surprise a few people #9 Dream What is the most interesting thing about this song for me is the fact that his girlfriend May Pang sings on this song. She does the talking or whispers (John)and also sings back up vocals. Her voice is much nicer that Yoko\u2019s.  ",

            "answer_text": "So many to choose from, so little time. just for variety, I\u2019ll go with one each from the four distinct phases of the band\u2019s career together, and then one from his solo years. Twist and Shout to me is the essential Lennon vocal performance of the early years. I\u2019ll say Ticket to Ride from their pre-psychedelic period. A Day in the Life\u2014 narrowly over both Tomorrow Never Knows and Strawberry Fields Forever\u2014 in part because of his dissatisfaction with the latter. Revolution\u2014 hard version though Come Together and Dear Prudence are strong contenders (among several others) Instant Karma pips the others from his solo years. Tomorrow I\u2019d give totally different answers\u2026 ",
