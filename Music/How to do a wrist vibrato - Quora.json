            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s Ray Chen on YouTube. He has a video that explains how to get started. I suggest you do more watching than listening. Notice how he has the heel of his hand braced on the shoulder, and then is using a simple knock, knock motion of the knuckles while the finger remains anchored on the note? Imagine you are rapping lightly on a door with your knuckles only, and you\u2019ll get the idea. It can sometimes be helpful to brace the end of the scroll against the wall when you start - that stabilizes the instrument and allows you to release any excess tension on the neck. Also remember to bring the side of the first finger away from the neck slightly (a width the size of a sheet of paper is enough), or you\u2019ll get \u201cstuck\u201d when you try that one. Fingers 2 and 3 are the easiest to begin with. It can be difficult to learn and to teach, for some people. Others pick it up with little effort.   ",
