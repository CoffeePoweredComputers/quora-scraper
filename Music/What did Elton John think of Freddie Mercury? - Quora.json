            "answer_text": "What did Elton John think of Freddie Mercury? In his own words, Elton \u201cadored\u201d Freddie and was \u201cdevastated\u201d at his death. They were very dear friends. They partied together a lot and one friend recalled how they both had a wicked sense of humor but when they got together they were uproarious. They and Rod Stewart\u2014who also said in his memoir that he \u201cadored\u201d Freddie\u2014 joked about forming a novelty supergroup called Teeth, Nose and Hair for obvious reasons. When asked later why nothing ever became of the idea Freddie joked that they could never agree on the order of the names. Elton famously congratulated Freddie for \u201cstealing the show\u201d at Live Aid happily celebrating his success rather than being envious. Elton was one of the very few people that Freddie shared his AIDS diagnosis with way back in 1987. [See UPDATE at the end.] Freddie didn\u2019t even tell his bandmates until a couple of years later. Elton described himself as crying like a baby on several different occasions. At the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert Elton was too emotional to participate in the finale in which everyone came on stage to sing together at the end. He was one of the few friends allowed to visit Freddie at Garden Lodge in the last weeks of Freddie\u2019s life and did so even though he said he couldn\u2019t stay very long because it was just too difficult watching Freddie suffer. He said in his memoir about the AIDS fight, Love is the Cure, \u201cIt broke my heart to see this absolute light unto the world ravaged by AIDS\u201d and that Freddie \u201ctruly lived for others\u201d up until the end. His last visit to Garden Lodge was in the afternoon of the very day that Freddie died. I\u2019m answering this after viewing a video of Elton singing \u201cThe Show Must Go On\u201d with Queen in 1997. Elton has even looked after two of Freddie\u2019s \u201cfamilies\u201d after he died\u2014his bandmates as well as his housemates at Garden Lodge. Elton and Freddie\u2019s PA both said said that Freddie was still worrying about and trying to look after and take care of his loved ones until the very end. Freddie even left his 25% share of the royalties for their last several albums to the three remaining band members. So Elton stepped in afterwards to comfort and support those who Freddie cared for so much. Elton has often sung Freddie\u2019s praises but his own behavior show what kind of man he is and it\u2019s time to to sing his praises. When Elton had a Boxing Day party and feast with a couple of dozen guests at his country estate the Christmas after Freddie died he invited Freddie\u2019s Garden Lodge family of Joe, Phoebe and Jim to come knowing that it would be such a difficult time for them. Freddie loved Christmas as well as birthdays and would go all out with decorations, food, and gifts making these special occasions particularly special for all of them. They truly were a family outside of his biological family and Elton understood this. Joe and Phoebe may have been working for Freddie but they dined at the same table with celebrity friends and guests. The first time Elton came to dinner at Garden Lodge after Jim moved in Jim was warned by Joe and Phoebe not to salt his food since he was to be seated next to Elton as Elton would inevitably salt both their plates. Elton once said that he felt sorry for the remaining members of Queen with Freddie gone and that \u201cYou guys should go out and play again. It must be like having a Ferrari in the garage waiting for a driver.\u201d In order to help them along, in January of 1997, Elton sang \u201cThe Show Must Go On\u201d with them at an event in Paris honoring Freddie and other AIDS victims with the Bejart Ballet, a big event helping Freddie \u201cbring ballet to the masses\u201d. This was only the second time the band had played since Freddie\u2019s death, the first being the tribute concert. Afterward, Brian and Roger began playing together again with various guest singers at awards ceremonies and charity concerts. Tragically, as Roger says in the following video, John was quite traumatized by Freddie\u2019s death and he told them after this very poignant performance with the ballet that he \u201ccould no longer do this\u201d. It was the last time John ever performed with them.  Need I mention what Elton has done in the fight against AIDS? Besides working tirelessly himself, he\u2019s helped raise a tremendous amount of money for assistance to AIDS victims, education to prevent the spread of AIDS and research for treatments and a cure. \u201cSince its inception in 1992 in the U.S. and 1993 in the U.K., John\u2019s charity The Elton John AIDS Foundation has raised over $500 million in the fight against AIDS.\u201d He also publicly befriended and advocated for an American boy named Ryan White who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion for hemophilia and others.  Elton John has been awarded France\u2019s highest civilian award, the Legion d\u2019Honneur.He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1995.For his charitable work he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 February 1998.Well done, Elton. [Update: Just read an article from USA Today about Elton\u2019s new memoir \u201cMe\u201d that claims Elton said in his new book that Freddie did not tell him about his diagnosis but that he found out from friends. But I DON\u2019T make stuff up so I did a search of one of the bios I\u2019ve read and found where I had gotten the info. The bio is called \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d about Freddie. Found the passage (page 360 on my kindle app) which has a footnote for Elton\u2019s earlier book \u201cLove is the Cure\u201d as its source: \u201cFreddie told me he had AIDS soon after he was diagnosed in 1987,\u2019 says Elton..\u201dI was devastated\u2026.\u201d The answer from this question by Julie Perkerson also has that quote credited not to \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d but directly from Elton\u2019s earlier book. If you happen to have both books please confirm or disprove this. The passage in \u201cLove is the Cure\u201d should be easy to find. Also, does Elton\u2019s new book \u201cMe\u201d really say that Elton he found out through friends? Or is the article wrong? Thanks.] ",

            "answer_text": "Elton and Freddie, were very good friends. Freddie cut off a lot of people close to him in the last few years of his life because he didn\u2019t want them to see him so sick. The only people who got to see Freddie during these last couple months were his \u201cinner circle,\u201d which was basically: The band, Jim Hutton, Jim beach, Terry Giddings, Peter Freestone, Joe Fanelli, Mary Austin, Dave Clark, and his biological family. He often refused when people wanted to come visit him like Montserrat Caball\u00e9, for example. This was not ill intent, but because he wanted people to remember him as healthy and happy. With all this considered, he let Elton John see him during the final stages of his life. Freddie didn\u2019t trust a lot of people, which is probably a result of his childhood. Peter Freestone said that Freddie\u2019s love was based on trust. Therefore the people he trusted he loved the most. Freddie was very guarded, and it took a lot for people to get through to him. When he let down his guard, he was very vulnerable. For Freddie to let Elton see him so vulnerable and sick says a lot about their friendship. In fact, Freddie arranged to have a Christmas present delivered to Elton after he died. Heres a video of Elton talking about it:  Elton said that hanging out with Freddie was a laugh. They often took the piss out of each other along with Rod Stewart. They came up with a fictional band by the name of Nose, Hair, and Teeth which made fun of their physical imperfections. Freddie very seldom would go to other artists rock concerts and he would go see Elton\u2019s if he was in town. In this video Elton says \u201cThis one\u2019s for ol\u2019Melina (Freddie), poor cow!\u201d Freddie had hurt his leg during this time and had to wear a cast.  Elton would also come over to Garden Lodge and eat dinner with Freddie and Jim. After Freddie died, Elton always made his home welcome for Jim to join them during holidays. These are just a few little stories, but it is clear they had a very good camaraderie. ",
