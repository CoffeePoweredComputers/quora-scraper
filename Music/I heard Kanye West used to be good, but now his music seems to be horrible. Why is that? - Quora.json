            "answer_text": "\u201cbut now his music seems to be horrible\u201d - that is definitely not the truth. As a fact, Kanye has received more critical acclaim for his newer albums than his older ones. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) was one of the only albums to receive a perfect 10 rating from Pitchfork, was named the album of the decade and is already considered as a classic in the genre. Yeezus (2013), too, was critically acclaimed and was named album of the year by various publications. Kanye\u2019s first three albums followed similar themes to each other, featured Kanye\u2019s classic soul-sampling style of production and were more focused on socially conscious lyrics. The people who claim that Kanye \u201cused to be good\u201d are those who are stuck up on the aforementioned phase of Kanye\u2019s music and are unwilling to accept change. And there are bound to be such haters because Kanye loves experimenting and hates settling down on a particular sound or style. His newer albums aren\u2019t \u201chorrible\u201d, they\u2019re just different. He has grown more of an artsy sort of mentality now and focuses more on creating memorable soundscapes and atmospheres with his production. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy relied on its dense, grandiose maximalism, while Yeezus sounded cold, harsh and minimalistic. I agree, however, that his latest project (The Life of Pablo) was a little disappointing. You could see what he was trying to do with the album (create a vast kaleidoscope of ideas and styles) but it just didn\u2019t strike me as much as his other work. ",

            "answer_text": "Kanye West\u2019s first few albums, College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation were all very similar, and were praised for their lyricism as well as their productions. After that, Kanye seemed to lean more to the production side (808\u2019s and Heartbreak, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy). As his fame grew, he focused more on his publicity and other aspects of his career (namely his clothing line) and since then, hasn't really returned to the lyrical aspect of his work like he used to. I would argue that his newer work is certainly ambitious, especially in the way that he presents it and himself in the media. But the main difference between old and new Kanye for me is Lyrics > Production and vice versa. (To be clear, I love his first three albums, and MBDTF. Yeezus has grown on me quite a bit. Pablo doesn't quite do it for me. I wouldn't quite say that I dislike new Kanye, but I personally prefer older stuff.) ",
