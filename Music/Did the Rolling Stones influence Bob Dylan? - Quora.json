            "answer_text": "I guess the question comes from Bob Dylan\u2019s Like a Rolling Stone song. Actually, its the pretty opposite. Bob Dylan wasn\u2019t inspired by Rolling Stones. If anything then Dylan inspired The Rolling Stones. Not that he only inspired Rolling Stones but also Beatles. The Beatles were a cheesy band in early \u201860s, something serious had happened after 1964, that they became very innovative and gone wild on their music and playing psychedelic rock. Ironically this was the year when they had met Bob Dylan. Its not drugs that Dylan had passed. He also passed his influence on them. Bob Dylan was an original artist who was playing folk music. Later he tried electric guitar and went heavy. But that just wasn\u2019t it. Bob Dylan was a very good harmonic player. He used his harmonica to drive wild sounds. And I can guess his high pitched harmonica solos made an impact on psychedelic music. He stuck to his folk roots with mixed of country and blues which ultimately led pop rock gone mixed with folk music and creating psychedelic rock. A prime example would be the Byrds. The Byrds were playing folk rock but later they diverted into psychedelic rock.  (The Byrds) So, its not a coincidence that most artists who were influenced by Dylan turned out to be psych rock. Initially they were British gents with combed hair and then they turned out with long messy hair. So, in conclusion what could be said that in UK there were great pop rock artists and out there in US there was Bob Dylan playing folk rock. And when it mixed it resulted psychedelic rock. Whereas in the case of Rolling Stones. They might not get influenced by Bob Dylan like Hendrix or Byrds but wouldn\u2019t say they never liked Bob Dylan. While Dylan on the other hand remained same all his life. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Woody Guthrie did. As he went along Dylan found himself more and more influenced by Appalachian folk, Irish funeral songs, hymnals, gospel and minstrel. Even his Sinatra covers make more sense when viewed in that context. I don\u2019t claim a huge familiarity with Dylan, but from what I know, he has never been a \u201crocker\u201d as most people understand the word. He\u2019s not from the Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley 3/2 school like the Stones. He doesn\u2019t boogie like the Dead nor he doesn\u2019t crank up the volume like Neil Young. He doesn\u2019t do \u201cbeats\u201d or \u201cgroove\u201d. Honestly, his attempts to \u201cgo modern\u201d on albums like Empire Burlesque and Under the Red Sky are laughable. Dylan may have started his career in the Rock Era but he\u2019s definitely not OF the Rock Era. ",

I guess that by the time the British Invasion and the rise of folk-rock was in full swing that Bob Dylan had realised that he could only go so far on acoustic, and decided to go electric. Let us be thankful he did, because several careers would have been very different if Bob Dylan didn't go electric. ",

            "answer_text": "Not as much as he influenced them.  Dylan has always been interested in going back to roots and finding the original source point as much as possible. Rather than being influenced by The Stones he was more influenced by the people that they drew from themselves. The Stones main cultural reference points were blues artists that influenced Dylan heavilly in his early days but less so as his career progressed. He didn't need to be influenced by an English interpretation of the music of Robert Johnson and Chuck Berry when he had the real thing himself. (Disclaimer- I'm a huge stones fan and not trying to put down their music in any way). ",
