            "answer_text": "Yes, Cakewalk by BandLab is really free. I think they now offer add-ons that they charge for, but you don\u2019t need to buy anything if you don\u2019t want to. The immediately previous owner, Roland Corporation, went belly up and BandLab bought the software in hopes of generating more traffic for its BandLab social media website. I used the software extensively for almost 20 years when it was called Sonar. It\u2019s quite full-featured (even without the add-ons), and the new owner is constantly improving it. Currently I use Cubase, because I work extensively with MIDI, and Cubase\u2019s MIDI features are superior to any other digital audio workstation. Cakewalk has a forum, and you can join here: Cakewalk Discuss | The Official Cakewalk by BandLab Forum They\u2019re a nice bunch, and always willing to help a newcomer. ",
