            "answer_text": "As others have said, there can never be just one greatest pianist in the world, as matters artistic will always be subjective. (And even in non-subjective fields, such as track and field, typically the winner of an event will simply be the best *on that day* - how many world record holders have failed to win Olympic Gold, for example?) I\u2019d include Martha Argerich, Stephen Hough, Maurizio Pollini, Murray Periaha, Radu Lupu, Angela Hewitt on any shortlist. However, if you want me to nominate a pianist who has the most amazing technique combined with supreme musicianship (and they often don\u2019t go together) then Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin gets my vote every time. And I\u2019m not just saying that because he is a fellow Canadian. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no one person who is best among such candidates as Argerich, Kissin, Perahia, Pollini, Wang and others. I can tell you that Lang Lang is not in the top rank, regardless of his fame. He is a virtuoso but not a great interpreter of classical music. You could say that he lacks insight or taste compared with the best pianists. ",
