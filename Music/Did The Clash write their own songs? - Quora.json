            "answer_text": "Yup they did. They had 3 singers\u2026Paul Simonon the bassist wrote and sang songs, but mostly Joe Strummer and Mick Jones did the writing and singing. One famous story is Topper Headon getting to band practice (or the studio) early. And he started writing the first rendition of Rock The Casbah while he was waiting for everyone..so Topper probably gets credit for that one. ",
