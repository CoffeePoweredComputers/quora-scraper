            "answer_text": "Driving an ex highway patrol car, black and white from North Carolina to California with a 1960 Ford long bed truck in tow. Both were loaded down, it was January and I 20 was closed due to ice the day I left, I 40 was closed due to ice just before Knixville Tennessee. I had been following tracks worn through the ice by previous vehicles through the Smokey Mountains until there were no more. They are what gave me traction, I slid into the cement barrier taking out about 4 ft of it with my truck front bumper and broke my tow bar. I unhooked it, drove into Knoxville, got it repaired and retrieved ed d my truck. When I got back to Knoxville I learned I 40 was closed so I spent the night there hoping it would open up in the morning. It did open up and I was on my way, I stopped at a super market parking lot in Little Rock to take a nap as I was getting sleepy and wound up picking up two teenage hitch hikers who were freezing. I then got back on the road, now I had freezing fog to contend with, on my CB radio I heard truckers complaining about their wipers becoming chunks of ice. I did not have such issues though my 8\u2032 whip antenna was now almost 2\u2033 in diameter and almost bent over touching my rear bumper. I had N50 ply tires on the rear which were great on dry pavement but horrible on ice. I had to ride the .edina with one side for traction. I heard the truckers talking about some blCk and white riding the median as well, warning others. I also saw many car and trucks in ditches thinking I could end this, 3,000 miles on snow and mostly ice towing a heavy truck at 20 to 40mph sucks. I finally made it through Texas, stopped by my aunts house in New Mexico, was there maybe 10 minutes when a cop knocked at the door. The two hitch hikers were runaways, he spotted them and asked how they got in my car. I explained and he took them and sent th hem back home. I stayed the night and continued on, around Flagstaff, my truck blew a tire, a 16.5 split rim tire. I did not have a jack for the truck, I found a large rock and backed the truck onto it until it raise that wheel high enough. I removed the wheel, put rocks in front of the front tires and I unhooked the truck and drove 40 miles in each direction before I found a tire. On my way again, made it to Califirnia, now I had 600 miles left and made it without incident, clear weather, only stopped for gas and exhausted. It was an exhausting, interesting, eventful trip full of potential life altering hazards but I managed to avoid or endure them all and made it home. Late, but in one piece and alive. I can not say I regretted it but there are many things I learned that I will be aware of and never do again. ",
