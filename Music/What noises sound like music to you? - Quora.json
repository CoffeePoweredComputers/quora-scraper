            "answer_text": "The Construction Site Collective.Here is something I put together just to demonstrate this, and also it\u2019s personally fun to do stuff like this. (Link goes to soundcloud) Construction Site Minimal Ensemble The distant metallic clinking from a construction site, the hammering & and the drilling can sometimes come together quite pleasingly. Distant is the key word here. Most irritating sounds can sound good from a safe distance where the horrendous sonic waves\u2019s screeching, jarring sounds become muffled, spacey and sweetened before they come at your eardrums, with a nice \u2018hai\u2019 rather than a wailing banshee weilding chainsaw gnawing at your eardrums, with nails for teeth. 2. Ceiling fans Potentially there is a song structure trapped within, everytime you use the fan. Intro || Stable rhythm || Outro I don\u2019t have time to make another piece to demonstrate it, so I\u2019ll describe it instead and hope that you can relate. IntroAncient ceiling fans tend to have a signature sound sequence as it approaches it\u2019s steady rate of rotation due to the fan blades interacting with elements in its enclosure. There is a resonant frequency where in the vibrations amplify as a result of these interactions, the most. There are several reasons for this, among loose bolts, fixtures etc. From the moment you switch it on, till the time it reaches it\u2019s stable speed (for example - from 0 rpm to 200 rpm) it passes through these resonant frequency (and its multiple factors) causing pulses of short whirring buzzes, which can sound cool. Steady RhythmAt it\u2019s steady state, the rattle is pretty much consistent, and rhythmic. However if for any reason there is a speed fluctuation it\u2019s characteristics or even the patterns can change. This rattle is not necessarily fixed at the rpm of the spinning wheels, rather it is much more complex, and can be a whole lot slower and perceivable, almost groovy lol OutroUsually sort of sounds like the intro section, only played in reverse if you think about it. It will also retrace the resonant rattles just as in the intro. I could go on and describe a whole lot more of organic noises, as answers before mine have rightly pointed out. All of them have musical tendencies, mostly a perception based experience. Off the top of my head, these two win for the day :) ",

            "answer_text": "Wind and water noises, especially the combination of wind and water: waves. The compositions of Nature tend to be very long with subtle structure so listening to hours-long speechless, motorless intervals in forests on mountains and shores, sailing and canoeing on lakes and seas increased my appreciation of music and long form compositions. I can hear when composers and musicians come from forests by the way they listen and play. Without this ear training I would not be able to appreciate solo piano epics by Sorabji, Alkan, Finnissey and Hersch nor the sparse Northern music of P\u00e4rt, Ustvolskaya, Gubaidulina and Saariaho. This also includes bird, amphibian and insect noises. Avian, canine and feline vocalizations are song semantically, but integral to this whole. Paul Winter made a series of albums combining mostly wind instruments with megafauna calls. Contemporary music also makes broad use of found object percussion. As an experimental music producer, I have been called on to amplify and record crumpling paper, rubbing balloons, falling water, blowing bubbles, lifting and dropping objects in water, tuned flower pots, keys shaking, etc. ",
