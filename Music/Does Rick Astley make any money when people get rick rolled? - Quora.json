            "answer_text": "A classic bait-and-switch scenario, the meme is as popular now as it\u2019s ever been. \u201cI think it\u2019s just one of those odd things where something gets picked up and people run with it,\u201d the eponymous singer told the L.A. Times in 2008. \u201cBut that\u2019s what's brilliant about the Internet.\u201d He originally rose to fame in the 1980s, scoring number one singles in the UK, a platinum-selling album, and even a Grammy nomination. But after millions upon millions of views, how much money has the rickrolling prank raked in for its star? Well, as of 2010, he has received the princely sum of\u2026$12. This is because Astley didn\u2019t write the song, so he only receives a performer\u2019s share of the sound recording copyright. Astley doesn\u2019t seem to have any hard feelings about rickrolling. \u201cListen, I just think it\u2019s bizarre and funny. My main consideration is that my daughter doesn\u2019t get embarrassed about it.\u201d And despite the prevalence of the meme, he has no plans to remix or re-release the song to cash in on the phenomenon.
