But she had many male friends..rm in his interview told that having male friends is not a problem but according to my point of view she did things that are unacceptable as a girlfriend so they broke up JUNG HOSEOK(J HOPE) even jhope used to have a girlfriend but she left him for another man PARK JIMIN(Jimin) He had a one side love..he said that he used to get very shy and his face would turn red even she is 5m apart.but he never said he was in relationship. Once yoongi told that jimin is the one with least experience JEON JUNGKOOK(JK) he said that he was in a relationship in his high school..but they brokeup cause the things didn't workout between them..he also said that he see no difference with and without girlfriend KIM TAEHYUNG (V) he said that he was in a one side love..once he called his gf on a rainy day but she didn't pickup that made him very sad so he left her MIN YOONGI(SUGA) He used to have a crush on a girl during middle school who is his classmate they were friends before their relationship and he proposed her and she accepted it but the things completely changed once they got into relationship as yoongi being shy he couldn't act naturally around her..and the things didnt go well so they ended up breaking their relation\u2026. THESE ARE THE WORDS SPOKEN BY IDOL THEMSELVES\u2026.KIM SEOKJIN(JIN) DIDNT MENTION ABOUT HIS PAST IN ANY INTERVIEW BUT RUMOURS ARE THAT JIN'S GIRLFRIEND CHEATED ON HIM\u2026.

Kim Seokjin revealed in the reaction video of 'Blood Sweat and Tears' that the kiss with the statue was the first kiss of his life. Jin has had a girlfriend in the past but it didn't last long because she cheated on him. Min Yoongi had one girlfriend in the past but they couldn't understand each other and therefore they broke up. Jung Hoseok had one girlfriend in the past who left him for another man. Park Jimin has had one girlfriend in the past but nothing romantic happened between the two. Jimin has had the least experience with respect to relationships, according to Suga. Kim Taehyung has had many girlfriends because he couldn't hurt the girls by saying no and he was always sought after because of his looks. There was one girl he specifically wanted to confess his love to. But she didn't pick up the phone because it was raining (!..) and he never called her back again. Jungkook has never had a girlfriend. Frankly, he is a 20 year old who is shit scared of girls. (Really). ",

That only means one thing, yes they date. it\u2019s kept very secret. Honestly they are young men with feelings and needs. How could they go years with no sexual or emotional intimacy. It\u2019s not normal. Maybe it\u2019s only hookups. They are at the height of their careers now and super Busy. They travel and work non stop. My guess is probably all had several discreet but short relationships edit. Tae said several times he would only wear a band ring on his fourth finger if he were taken. So here it is. Recent photos of no jewelry but the 4 th finger ring. Selcas from 2020. Difficult to see in some photos but yes it\u2019s there. Same ring, same finger    Difficult to see but it\u2019s there. Grammy night   everyone know V wears band rings on his fingers (below) but was saving the fourth finger. True or not? What do you think? ",

I think all of the hyung line has had serious girlfriends pre-idol career but broke up with them for various reasons. I think the maknae line has dated when they were really young but haven\u2019t had serious relationships since. I know people are saying how can these handsome guys in their 20s not have relationships. To be honest I don\u2019t see how they can be in relationships with their current schedules. They are constantly flying overseas and constantly promoting in S.Korea and Japan when they aren\u2019t overseas, even if they have girls/boys (I do not assume sexuality) they are interested in I do not see how they can make anything work. Yes there is facetime, etc. but relationships need one on one time and these guys barely have time to see their families yet alone a significant other. Honestly if any of them are in relationships it was something that started long before they blew up because with their schedule as is I just don\u2019t see them being able to start any new relationship when they are constantly being moved from one schedule to another and from one country to the next. Also I think they are trying to be very careful with their career right now, with this many eyes on them if there were girlfriend/boyfriends in the picture they are VERY good at hiding it. ",

They don't have a No Dating clause in their contract at all, BigHit has never felt the need to micromanage their lives to that extent, but they aren't just busy with domestic activities in Korea but worlwide activities. Any relationship they have would be strained by their busy schedule, the constant lack of actual dating time, and their own workaholic natures. (I also feel like it would be a bit intimidating to date someone from a group as close as BTS\u2026it's like date one get six free, cause you better be comfy sharing your SO with six other people). If they have a private relationship, it's being kept very private, something I hope all fans would respect. They're human and deserve the right to date if they want to have romantic relationships. I would hope ARMYs as a whole would be happy if it came out that any of the members were dating and they would be supportive of it. As of right now though, they've got schedules that span the globe spreading into next year, comeback prep I'm sure (or at the very least the regular grind of creating music and practicing) and prep for end of year music festivals and the award shows in January. They're busy humans. They don't have a lot of down time, so I'm doubting any of them are currently dating with their schedule. ",

Jin is almost 26. Can you imagine a 26 year old successful handsome man who's never dated more than once and that too in high school? I can't even imagine a 20 year old like Jungkook never having dated less than twice at LEAST. Yeah they all want to focus on their careers and are very busy but feelings can overcome a lot, and I feel sorry for them a little because I'm pretty sure their relationships probably went through many problems due to their demanding work schedule. Oh, but if we're sticking to every word of your question, I can't be sure of whether they had/have girlfriends or not. Even if any of them aren't heterosexual I doubt they'd reveal it in a mostly homophobic country. ",

They are allowed to date, but they themselves have said they're not interested in getting a girlfriend at the moment\u2014they want to focus on their careers, and getting a girlfriend would mean having to spend more attention on either their career or that girlfriend. Neglecting their career would effect other members, and neglecting the girlfriend would probably cause a quick end to the relationship. ",

That is confirmed for most members but currently it's not out whether any of the member is dating but there usually are rumors but to be honest, I don't remember but I think it was Dispatch that said that they have given up on BTS because the members are never alone when they are out they are usually always together or are always out with other idols and never girls. But I wish even if people know anything about their current dating situation people won't make a huge deal out of it because it's a really difficult situation for idols thanks to crazy fans luckily a lot of ARMYs do say they will support them but then every fandom has immature fans so I hope there won't be a problem in the future.

Some of the older members (namely, RM, Suga, and J-Hope) have revealed they had girlfriends when they were younger, but ever since they debuted in 2013, none have come out with a relationship publicly. This is less because they are busy or not interested, but more so because they need to protect their career. In the South Korean pop music industry (called K-pop), a practice that is well-accepted is that members of boy and girl bands do not date publicly. There are some exceptions, but for the overwhelming majority of K-pop singers, especially the ones with young fans, even just an unfounded dating rumor can have negative impacts. As such, many entertainment companies will advise their talents to steer clear of doing anything that could be interpreted as them having boyfriends/girlfriends. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really sure they have. Aside from the very busy schedule, I think they are focusing on their career right now. They might have partners, they might not. We won't know for sure unless they told us themselves. Why would it matter, though? As long as they still make amazing music, I don't think we need to know anything about their private lives. Also, it seems that it's such a wild concept if someone isn't interested in dating/love. So many people said that they must have ones because they're adults(???). I mean, you can still live even without having to have a girlfriend/boyfriend. If they are enjoying what they do, and what they're doing right now makes them happy, I think it's not such a strange thing that they want to focus on their career and not their love lives. People can still have a good life even without sex/partners if they are happy with their lives. But, if they do have one, then good for them! As long as they're happy and enjoying their lives, I think we, as fans, shouldn't bother much about their private lives. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I mean, some BTS members might secretly have girlfriends. But to answer your question, it\u2019s basically because of two reasons: They\u2019re hella busy. A lot of Korean celebrity couples have broken up because their schedules were really busy and they didn\u2019t get to see each other that much. BTS members have said that they want to focus on their career for now, and I totally understand because they\u2019re like that one top idol in Korea and 2018\u20132020 will probably be the best part of their careers.Having a girlfriend is going to lose them a HUGE ton of fans. Frankly speaking, the idol industry is much, much different from other entertainment industries. Idol groups act as though they are in a relationship with their fans- their \u2018fan services\u2019, fan meetings, etc. And so a lot of fans would quit being a fan if they find out that their favorite idol member has a girlfriend. Why risk that now, when they\u2019re doing so well?",

However, no current relationship has been confirmed. Their private life should be respected,\u2019\u2019 and someone else added: \u2018\u2019 and no one should make rumors about them, or any assumptions if not proven\u2019\u2019 I think its pretty clear ",

They have a lot of workThey don\u2019t have time to spend time with their girlfriends (if they had any)I think everybody had a girlfriend in the past. If not, please comment. And as they said, one day they will marry Armys, so we must let our finger empty. You know, when they are on TV many interviewers are asking them, if they have a girlfriend. And there is a shocking fact: There aren\u2019t only girls that like them. They have many male fans. There is a fact, that Jin was in school, where were only boys there, and he got 15 roses on valentin. And also at one RUN show, there you can see that some men were turning heads to see Jimin. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah certainly BTS had girlfriends in there past almost all of them had atleast one. But now they are single clearly . This is not because they don't want one but it is because they are restricted by a contract. All k-pop idols have to sign a contract and according to that they can't date until the contract is not over.they have to strictly follow this . Many of you must be curious why this contract is made . Well in my opinion their are 2 main reasons that are To maintain the clean image of Korea . In world Korea has a quite respectful image so to maintain it k-pop idol should be single.If k-pop idols will not be single then people will not be much attracted by them. As a fan if a girl will see her favourite k-pop idol dating and being with another girl she will slowly and steadily start hating him. Thus this can decrease the number of fans.",

That being said, please do not easily think that they have girlfriends. Being straight is not the ground sexuality, but so is being gay, asexual, transexual, pansexual, etc. Yes, the boys have been asked \u2018Who is your ideal type\u2019, and they have responded answers that clearly fit a girl, but: You must understand that South Korea is still not very open to the idea of being \u2018gay\u2019, \u2018lesbian\u2019, or \u2018liking the same gender\u2019. I am not saying that any of the members are gay or part of the LGBTQ+ community, but as I have stated earlier, it also means that we can\u2019t just determine that they\u2019re straight, unless they do come out as straight, or asexual. (I DO have a friend who said that a close relative of hers is dating Taehyung, but she also told me that her friend whistled Jungkook\u2019s part in DNA. Of course I\u2019m not believing her.) ",

But talking about the present, I think BTS is too busy to have any active love life and the amount of success they have gained proves that. How can one imagine both a successful career and love life at the same time? All that matters is the hard work and with that I totally have a belief that BTS will get what they deserve. All we guys, as fans, can do is wish them success\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026and whoever comes in their life, we are gonna have to accept it.  JUST LOOK AT THEM FIRST, U THINK THEY NEED SOMEONE TO COMPLETE THEMSELVES!  ",

So, take information listed by fans with a pinch of salt. That will help you save your heart. ",

The company allowed them to date, but it must be their personal choice to not get involve in any relationship. As what would the boys answer during interviews regarding this question: \u201cWe are focusing on our career. \u201c (Jhope whispers *we date each other* lmao) -Borahae ",
