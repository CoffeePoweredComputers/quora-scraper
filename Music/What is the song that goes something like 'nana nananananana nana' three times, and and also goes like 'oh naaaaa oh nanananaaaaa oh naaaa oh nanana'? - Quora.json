            "answer_text": "There have been so many \u201cNana nanananana Nana\u201d songs over the years, I find it difficult to answer this question. However, while looking, I heard many old tunes that I hadn\u2019t heard in years, so you made my day. I\u2019ll share a few to help make your day too! First is Jim South in 1969, singing the song, The Games People Play.  The Alan Parson\u2019s Project in 1980 sang the same song, The Games People Play.  This answer could go on and on and on and \u2026. Ok, now I\u2019m pretty tired of Nana nananana songs. If it\u2019s not in one of these top 50 nananana songs, I give up!  I sure hope the song you were looking for is on my list of songs. Was it? ",
