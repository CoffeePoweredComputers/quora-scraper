            "answer_text": "By almost every measure, it\u2019s Whitney Houston, hands down. Her range, power, and ability to interpret lyrics was superlative. She could be a pop diva, an R&B chanteuse, or a sweaty gospel shouter (my favorite). Although Houston died much to soon, she left an impressive body of work, number one hits, and several Grammy awards. Amy Winehouse was a special, special talent. She was different in many ways from her peers and her style was unique. But as she was just starting her career, we don\u2019t have evidence that she was going to build upon her style. So as a singer, there is an insufficient body of work. But judging by their output, it\u2019s Whitney. ",

            "answer_text": "I won't make this a lengthy answer- Whitney Houston is the better vocalist by a country mile. Her vocal range was immense, she delivered her songs with clarity and precision, and she was a consulate performer. On the other hand, Amy had undeniable talent, but her range was limited, her delivery was haphazard, and her professional manner was awkward and disturbed. Line the two of them up on a stage, give them each a microphone, and draw your own conclusions. Although I liked them both, Whitney was obviously the better singer of the two. ",
