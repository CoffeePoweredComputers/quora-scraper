            "answer_text": "It's tough at 16 knowing you want to be an entrepreneur but not quite having the vision, knowledge of business, or contacts. I'd offer these five bits of advice to help you develop into the entrepreneur you want to be.  Offer to work at a start-up for free. Even if all you do is push papers, get the mail, and pick-up catered lunches it will be worth it. You will be able to watch and learn the habits of what makes entrepreneurs and start-up employees successful. Focus on and develop your habits. Get in the habit of thanking everyone even if it is for a small favor. Once you become a leader, your words have greater effect on people and you have to encourage, thank, and motivate your employees often. Get in the habit of doing what you say you will do. Entrepreneurs are great at follow-up and execution. Be punctual, as a habit. As a young entrepreneur, you will often be given less opportunity to make mistakes. If you show up 5 minutes late to a meeting you may lose a deal/investement/etc. Connect with Mentors early. I have been constantly helped along the way by people who knew me when I was 16. Reach out to the most successful people you know and ask if you could shadow them for a day or sit down for coffee. Learn from them. One of the most rewarding things for successful folks is watching and helping young people along the way. At 18, I had a group of 5 people who I ran almost every life/business decision by. Since them, some have filtered in and out but I've always kept 5 role models who's opinions I respect and can ask anything. They will help you avoid more mistakes then you knew you could make. Be patient. Instant gratification is great but it is not realistic in business. You (most likely) will not become an incredibly successful entrepreneur overnight. Wait for the right opportunity, work hard until then, and when you do move have the right people in place to support you. Start something now. Even if you wash cars, pressure wash peoples houses, sell things on ebay. Start something and set a small, attainable goal like 10K in sales for the year. You will become comfortable with all different aspects of the business and learn what you're best at. That way, once you are going for a bigger opportunity later in life you will understand your strengths and weaknesses. ",

            "answer_text": "Fate Favors a Prepared Mind My daughter is 15. She came up with an idea to fix a problem that was bugging her. She told me about it and I thought, \u201cI would buy stock in that company if there was one.\u201d So I did and we formed AZILA Holdings, LLC.We currently (5-5-15) are seeking the right patent attorney so that we may move forward. It is quite easy to file to become a LLC. There is lot\u2019s of info on the web. Not all LLC laws are alike. Find out how different states govern their LLCs. Find the features that are important to you. I like Nevada LLC law because it is the Swiss Army Knife of LLC law. You can form a LLC in one state and file as an alien in your state to operate there. But you will be governed by the laws of the state in which you file for the most part. Whatever you do, read up on the laws of the state you choose and the one you work in. Venture Capital has a thing for Delaware C corporations. There are many possibilities, find the one that is best for you.  You will need to deal with lawyers eventually read up on that. Learn how to shop for one. There is much on the web that is free regarding legal forms.   Stanford University has some of the VERY BEST online lectures that are free that deal with this subject. These are videos that are recordings of actual classes that took place at Stanford. There are several of these classes. iTunes U is a great source or I believe you can find them on YouTube or the Stanford website. Stanford has an App called, \u201cecorner\u201d. From there you can have access to over 3,000 videos regarding the subject. Watch all the videos from Stanford you can find. Among the best is \u201cHow to Start a Startup\u201d , \u201cEntrepreneurial Thought Leaders\u201d and \u201cEntrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital\u201d  But there is one you should start with above all others. You will find it in the class, \u201cEntrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital\u201d. Download and play, \u201cCourse Overview\u201d recorded 1-9-2013, with Bill Coleman, Tom Kosnik and David Hornik. Go near the end and listen to David Hornik give a presentation of the Big Picture and the future you will live in. It is an outstanding Must See. Given that you are 16, your age is a fantastic advantage, because you will be able to get access to almost anyone you want to talk to about advice\u2026 really. First, get a large pad of paper. Write out a list of all of your relatives. Next to their names, the name of their husband, wife or whatever. Then what they do and where they went to school and so on. Ask your mom and dad to fill in the blanks and provide some history. This is your core. Then start a list of all your real friends and their family and friends. Or you could just do it all on your phone. The idea is you will begin to see how you are connected to the world via relationship. Whenever you read about someone you admire or is doing something that catches your attention write them down and reference the source. Then look them up and find out all about them and who they hang with. Outside of family try to limit this list to the smartest people.  When you do ask someone older for advice or connections usually people will see their younger selves in you and will be more than willing to help. What you need most is to build a network of advisors and relationships that you can tap for expertise and connections. It is important to remember, that people\u2019s time is their most valuable asset, even more than cash or anything else. So, go online and find some \u201cthank you\u201d notes that are a reflection of you. Sounds kind of crazy, but hand write a short meaningful thank you to anyone who gives you their time. This will do a number of things. One, it will stand out and thus get more attention, being unusual. It will arrive days later, due to snail mail and thus cause them to remember you in a positive, strong way. For you are starting the foundation of relationship.  If you are given advice you act on and things turn out well, send your advisor a short email with a brief depiction of how what they said helped and again thank them. But try to make it very brief. Again you are building.  Learn as much about these people as you can. Build files on them. My kids call me The Stalker, because I am fanatical about this. Business more than ever is about relationships and the trust that they can generate. Over the years you will begin to develop a sense of who is good at what and it will save you a ton of time. Also you will know what people like so that when you come across something that maybe of interest to them you can share it. Just the other day I shared 3 journal articles with a neuroscientist that I thought he may like. Maybe he knew about them and maybe not. Turns out he had not seen them and was quite happy to get them. He will remember me. Invest in a Linkedin account. This is the gateway to your future, at least for now. This will allow you to communicate with almost anyone. It will help you find almost anyone. Whenever you contact anyone you think may be valuable to your future, ask them to join you on Linkedin. Each person has a universe of relationships, you never know who they might know. Do not abuse this. Only contact people when absolutely necessary and have one well prepared question that you have obviously done a lot of research on. Only turn to Linkedin when you have exhausted all other resources.  Linkedin is also is a billboard about you. I don\u2019t need or want a job so I don\u2019t post much about myself. But given you are starting out, it is a good foot forward so be very thoughtful about what you put there. Also, if you have posted some stupid teenage stuff on other websites, get it removed. Work overtime to do that. Your reputation is the most important thing you have.   It is important that you have the mindset of changing the world for the better. For business can be an avenue for dramatic positive change. It is an opportunity to exercise passion on a daily basis. It is about solving a problem or problems. To do so, you must take action. Business is about executing well and adjusting on the fly. Reid Hoffman, serial entrepreneur and now VC, describes the experience as \u201cbuilding a plane while falling off a cliff.\" Being an Entrepreneur is about building a business from scratch via relationships. With few exceptions most startups have two or three co-founders. So you need to be socially adept and become good at reading people and at communicating. Learn how to write well and take up public speaking. Above all learn how to listen and compromise effectively. Further, always do what you say you will do or don\u2019t say it. Walk the talk. If your school has a drama department get a part some plays. Because you will need to make presentations to groups in the future and that will help. Also if there is a chance for a public speaking class or club, do that too. It is vitally important to be able to present in a clear crisp manner while being entertaining. Learn how to make people laugh, study comedy.  Exercise regularly, make it a habit. People will make a judgement about you subconsciously in the first minute when they first meet you and that will stick with them. So make a habit of maintaining yourself well. Learn to meditate like a Samurai. Do that for the rest of your life. It will teach you how to focus your mind like a laser and lessen the ability of fear to cloud your mind. For you will have plenty of opportunity for fear to affect your decisions and it is much better to work with logic.      That should get you started. One more thing, as Yoda said, \u201cTry not! Do. Or do not. There is no try.\u201d Addendum: 7-17-2015 submitted provisional application for patent with USPTO. Within 12 months we must submit for grant of patent, or loose it all. We currently have patent pending status and are protected as long as we submit within 12 months. This is good for Canada, Europe and almost anywhere the U.S. has a patent treaty. Europeans  and others can use this too. But they must get a U.S. Patent too. My daughter was approached by an Angel 7-18-2015. ",
