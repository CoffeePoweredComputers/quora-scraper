            "answer_text": "After revolutionizing the television landscape with its streaming service, Netflix began unveiling its own original shows in 2013, with House of Cards becoming the company\u2019s first hit single of sorts. More popular shows were soon to follow, and today the company is only gaining momentum. The current stable of Netflix Originals includes a massive number of scripted and documentary series produced in-house or co-produced with other studios specifically for Netflix \u2014 and that\u2019s not even counting the gobs of other programs on Netflix, including many for which the company holds exclusive streaming rights. With such a diverse pool of originals to choose from, you might be wondering: Which of these shows are worth watching for 11 straight hours this weekend? That\u2019s where we come in. I\u2019ve assembled a list of the best Netflix Original series available right now. \u2018AMERICAN VANDAL\u2019 After 27 cars in the high-school faculty\u2019s parking lot are vandalized with crude phallic images, the school\u2019s resident slacker and class clown is expelled, but when two fellow students initiate a documentary-style investigation into the incident, suddenly everyone becomes a suspect in this surprisingly compelling and hilarious series. A satire of true-crime documentaries like Making a Murdererand Serial, American Vandal is a mockumentary that manages to channel much of the same \u201cDid he really do it?\u201d uncertainty into its story, while also offering a very funny and impressively clever spin on the typical docuseries format. Much like the true-crime series that inspired it, the first season of American Vandal is packed with narrative twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. It\u2019s supremely binge-friendly as you push to discover the next revelation in this seemingly minor incident that consumes the lives of the characters involved in it. The first season of the series earned rave reviews, prompting Netflix to commission a second season, which premiered September 14 to even more critical acclaim. Sadly, that might be the last we see of the series, as Netflix abruptly canceled it in October as part of a wave of cancellations of projects Netflix co-produced with other studios. \u2018BIG MOUTH\u2019 If you can handle a little bit (OK, a lot) of potty humor, you should enjoy Big Mouth.The animated series follows two seventh graders, Nick and Andrew (series creator Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, respectively), as they struggle with their burgeoning sexuality, represented by a grotesque, crass \u201chormone monster\u201d (also voiced by Kroll), whose base desires cause turmoil and frustration for both boys. Their friends Jessi (Jessi Klein) and Jay (Jason Mantzoukas) also struggle with puberty to varying degrees, as does Andrew\u2019s crush, Missy (Jenny Slate). On its surface, Big Mouth is quite crude, but that humor belies the show\u2019s nuanced, relatable exploration of adolescence. The series deftly handles the difficulties of middle school life, including common misconceptions held by kids about their sexuality and their body. The second season of Big Mouthpremiered October 5, and the series was renewed for a third season the following month. \u2018BLACK MIRROR\u2019 What happens when technology goes too far? That\u2019s not an unreasonable question to ask oneself in 2018, and Black Mirror(originally broadcast on British Channel 4, before being acquired by Netflix) is a wildly entertaining, if depressing, answer to that question. Most of the episodes of this chilling anthology series ponder hypothetical eventualities resulting from the unchecked advancement of technology, often charting courses that are disturbingly well-connected to the way we work and live today. The show\u2019s production value keeps getting better, and the third and fourth seasons \u2014 produced by Netflix \u2014 include a bevy of household names, from Jesse Plemons to Gugu Mbatha-Raw (whom creator/writer Charlie Brooker uses to great effect). The first two seasons \u2014 including the epic Christmas special White Christmas \u2014 are also must-see programming. \u2018BOJACK HORSEMAN\u2019 Despite lukewarm reviews for its first season, BoJack improved dramatically and received critical acclaim for the following three campaigns. The animated show centers around BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett), a washed-up \u201990s sitcom star (and actual horse-man) trying to find happiness and reclaim his former fame. Anthropomorphic half-breeds are the norm, and the show milks much of its humor by simply playing off stereotypes associated with the characters\u2019 animal halves. The show\u2019s true strength lies in its sincerity, however, as BoJack struggles to deal with his insecurities in a town rife with celebrity and its many vapid failings. Paul F. Tompkins (Best Week Ever), Alison Brie (Community, GLOW), and Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) provide excellent voice support in a series that flips from hilarious to depressing with impressive grace. The series was renewed for a sixth season in October 2018. \u2018CHEF\u2019S TABLE\u2019 This documentary web series introduces viewers to top culinary minds across the world, offering insight into the day-to-day experiences and responsibilities of renowned chefs. Each episode focuses on a different restauranteur and blends together personal stories with culinary content to great effect. The show\u2019s traditional documentary presentation can be a bit stuffy at times, and the narratives can be unevenly balanced in favor of emotional backstories, but most viewers should enjoy and appreciate some insight into the wide world of fine dining. The quality of each episode hinges largely upon the personality of the chosen chef, and some \u2014 notably Massimo Bottura in the first season, Dominique Crenn in the second, and the brash Ivan Orkin in the third \u2014 are more camera-friendly than others. Still, the series is a welcome departure from the competition-focused cooking shows that dominate cable and network TV. If you like this, Chef\u2019s Table France is also worth seeing. \u2018THE CROWN\u2019 The Crown is perhaps the best show on television right now, period. Easily the most celebrated British period piece since Downton Abbey, The Crown follows Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 the still-reigning Queen of England, at 91 years old \u2014 across different periods of her life, beginning with her 1947 marriage to Prince Philip of Edinburgh. Reception to the series has been overwhelmingly positive, as nearly ever aspect of the show \u2014 acting, production value, historical accuracy \u2014 has been widely praised. The series\u2019 interesting format sees Netflix recasting the role of Elizabeth and other characters season-to-season; Claire Foy starred in seasons one and two alongside Matt Smith (Dr. Who) and Vanessa Kirby, while we know Olivia Colman (Peep Show) will be taking the reins in season three (with Helena Bonham Carter set to portray Princess Margaret as well). Netflix plans to produce a total of 60 episodes over six seasons. \u2018DAREDEVIL\u2019 The first in a slew of Marvel shows to hit Netflix over the past few years, Daredevil stands largely on the strength of Charlie Cox\u2019s performance in the title role. Cast in a similar vein as Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman movies, this series shows a darker side to Marvel Studios\u2019 colorful cast of superheroes. The blind vigilante spends his days protecting New York City\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen as a lawyer, and his nights doing the same in a much more tangible (and violent) manner. The show\u2019s action sequences are fun, and amiable supporting performances from Elden Henson (The Mighty Ducks) and Deborah Ann Woll (True Blood) bring some comic relief and heart to the bleak setting, but as usual, the real stars of the show are the villains. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio is excellent as the deranged Kingpin, while Jon Bernthal\u2019s turn as the Punisher \u2014 which earned him his own Netflix series \u2014 is as convincing as it is visceral. Season 3 of the series premiered October 19 and earned widespread praise, with some calling it the best season of the series so far. Sadly, the series was canceled by Netflix shortly after the debut of season 3 as part of its efforts to reduce the number of series it co-produces with other studios. \u2018DARK\u2019 As the only foreign-language entry on our list, Dark would merit some curiosity at the very least, but it\u2019s here not because it\u2019s German, but because it\u2019s awesome. A Stranger Things-esque setup \u2014 missing children from a small town, supernatural occurrences, mysterious laboratories \u2014 will have you thinking you know what to expect, but trust us, you don\u2019t. The town of Winden lives in the shadow of eternal clouds, lending Dark a more macabre vibe than Stranger Things, which peppers in comic sequences and lots of nostalgia. Dark weaves together multiple storylines amid complex relationships endemic to small-town life, even outside the good, old U.S. of A. If you\u2019re in the mood for a lighthearted romp or a satisfying romance arc, move on \u2014 this is not the show for you. But if you love serious shows with a flair for the dramatic (and a heaping helping of despair). \u2018DEAR WHITE PEOPLE\u2019 After Justin Simien\u2019s 2014 film of the same name earned rave reviews, Netflix commissioned the young director for a multiseason TV series, featuring the same characters (recast) and an altered storyline. The series is about black students at a predominantly white (and fictitious) Ivy League college, Winchester University, who work to try and find both group and individual identities while carving out a place within the school\u2019s ecosystem. Logan Browning stars as Sam White, a student who runs a radio show titled Dear White People, which causes some controversy among the student body. Thanks to Simien\u2019s expert touch, the show deftly handles the nuances of identity, romance, education, and socialization with plenty of comedic moments, helping to inform viewers of all colors about other points of view without ever seeming judgmental or vindictive. The second season premiered in May 2018, and the series was renewed for a third season the next month. \u2018EASY\u2019 This anthology series, created by mumblecore hotshot Joe Swanberg (Win It All), provides a template for relatable and realistic depictions of love and sex in the 21st century. Despite a star-studded list of performers \u2014 including Orlando Bloom, Emily Ratajkowski, and Dave Franco, to name a few \u2014 Swanberg manages to make you forget that you\u2019re watching someone famous by crafting characters that are deep, yet not too complicated to fit into a 30-minute window. Each vignette catalogs the struggles of a couple or group of people in contemporary Chicago, where gender roles and language barriers are equal obstacles for people seeking happiness. The show\u2019s brevity prevents most of the stories from reaching any sort of satisfying conclusion, but it\u2019s a sincere collection of not-so-tall tales that most will find familiar and engaging. If you watch through both seasons, there are even some neat callbacks. \u2018GLOW\u2019 Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A down-on-her-luck actress in the mid-1980s (Alison Brie) finds surprising fulfillment when she joins a low-budget women\u2019s wrestling program run by a seedy, dishonest director (Marc Maron). Oh, what\u2019s that? You\u2019ve never seen anything like this? Duh. GLOW \u2014 which stands for Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling \u2014 was a real show in the mid-80s that featured wrestling (of course), wacky and colorful characters, and crazy comedy sketches. Netflix\u2019s take on it sees the ladies of GLOW battling their own personal issues while trying to come together and produce a successful show; it\u2019s a dangerous premise, but one that works incredibly well thanks to dedicated performances from Brie, Maron, and Betty Gelpin. British rocker Kate Nash, Sydelle Noel, and Britney Young are also excellent in supporting roles. Season 2 premiered in June to positive reviews, and the series was renewed for a third season in August 2018. \u2018THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE\u2019 This terrifying series from Mike Flanagan, the writer and director of criminally under-appreciated horror films Oculus and Ouija: Origin of Evil, offers a new spin on Shirley Jackson\u2019s 1959 novel of the same name. It follows a family who moves into an old house intending to renovate it, only to experience one scary paranormal event after another before a mysterious tragedy forces them out of the haunted manor. The story unfolds through a mix of timeline-hopping explorations of each family member\u2019s experiences at Hill House and years later, as the trauma of those encounters shapes their lives and eventually brings them back to where it all started. Beautifully shot, expertly paced, and filled with the sort of subtle call-backs that encourage multiple viewings, The Haunting of Hill House is one of the best horror tales to debut on any screen \u2014 big or small \u2014 in recent years. Oh, and if you don\u2019t believe us, just consider that Stephen King himself described the series as \u201cclose to a work of genius.\u201d \u2018JESSICA JONES\u2019 Krysten Ritter shines as antihero Jessica Jones, who rejected her superhero persona after a traumatic experience at the hands of Kilgrave (David Tennant), and now runs her own detective agency. Like Daredevil, the series is darker and more grounded than Marvel\u2019s cinematic efforts, though it\u2019s missing some of the goofy lighthearted qualities that Daredevilbrings. Jessica Jones is thematically heavier, as the characters deal with topics like rape and PTSD. As with Daredevil, the villain is the sizzle of this first season \u2014 Tennant\u2019s take on the villain Kilgrave conjures perhaps the best performance of any on-screen Marvel bad guy this side of Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Loki. The show\u2019s structure seems uniquely suited for the future inclusion of guest heroes; Luke Cage figures prominently in the first season, while season 2 has its own intriguing new characters to build upon. Both Jones and Cage (along with Daredevil and Iron Fist) featured heavily in Netflix\u2019s crossover series The Defenders. The third season is expected to premiere in 2019. \u2018LOST IN SPACE\u2019 The latest adaptation of Irwin Allen\u2019s landmark 1960s sci-fi series, Lost In Spaceis centered on the Robinson family, which has taken to the stars together, courtesy of a program aimed at finding a new home for humanity. Of course, their craft veers off course and they end up in a new galaxy entirely, leading \u2014 as you might expect \u2014 to a series of dangerous scenarios in which the family must work together to survive. Toby Stephens (Black Sails) plays army-dad John Robinson, whose wife (Maureen) is the expedition leader. The kids are played by Taylor Russell, Mina Sundwall, and Maxwell Jenkins, with support from Parker Posey, Ignacio Serrichio, and more. While it\u2019s the same old take on The Swiss Family Robinson at its core, the series\u2019 special effects, set design, and cinematography are all top-notch, lending a sense of legitimacy to the many perils faced by the space Robinsons & co. Perhaps more importantly, the family dynamic \u2014 especially with the three children and the robot Will befriends \u2014 feels real, turning this from an also-ran space sitcom into a pretty great show. \u2018MASTER OF NONE\u2019 If you\u2019ve never seen an episode of Master of None, you might be surprised to see star/creator Aziz Ansari depart from his trademark style of comedy \u2014 namely, loud, ridiculous, and goofy \u2014 and try on an outfit that looks brand new, but somehow feels worn-in. The show follows Dev Shah (Ansari), a not-so-famous actor living in New York (then, later, Italy) who is simply trying to get by. Master of Noneoffers a unique and honest take on comedy that\u2019s less reliant on punchlines and more situational \u2014 it\u2019s Louie, with a Millennial twist. Some episodes are funny, while some are sad, but the majority of them feel well-written and natural. No\u00ebl Wells and Eric Wareheim (Tim and Eric Awesome Show) provide some help off the bench, and while the acting can occasionally feel a bit strained (especially in the first season), Ansari\u2019s crisp writing and relatable performances (he won a Golden Globe for his efforts) truly carry the show. Aziz\u2019s real parents also appear as Dev\u2019s parents in several hilarious segments, displaying comedy chops that must be hereditary. \u2018MINDHUNTER\u2019 Why do we obsess over serial killers? Perhaps it\u2019s because we don\u2019t truly understand what makes them tick. That\u2019s the hook for Mindhunter, a crime drama with executive production credits for both David Fincher (Fight Club, Gone Girl) and Charlize Theron. Jonathan Groff (Glee, Hamilton) and Holt McCallany play FBI agents tasked with interviewing and assessing serial killers in order to build personality profiles which might help solve ongoing and future cases. Aside from Anna Torv (Fringe), a largely anonymous cast takes the stage here, as the pair of agents investigates and interviews real killers from the mid-late 20th century, including one Ed Kemper. Mindhunter is largely a bleak affair, with a general sense of dread pushed forward by creepy performances and graphic crime scene photos. Still, it\u2019s a curious subject and one which informs the detective work done by characters in modern cop dramas. If you liked Nightcrawler, Zodiac, and Silence of the Lambs, you\u2019ll like Mindhunter. \u2018NARCOS\u2019 Yes, Pablo Escobar is played out, and the show takes its fair share of historical liberties. However, any quibbles with this series can easily be pardoned thanks to some absolutely brilliant performances by Wagner Moura (Escobar) and Boyd Holbrook (Steve Murphy), the latter of which is on his way to becoming a bona fide action star thanks to turns in the excellent Logan and The Predator. Narcos details Escobar\u2019s rise to wealth and power as the face behind one of the largest drug cartels of all time, based out of Medellin, Colombia. Moura oscillates between dedicated family man and ruthless kingpin with alarming ease, while DEA agents Murphy and Javier Pe\u00f1a (Pedro Pascal) work to capture the elusive patron. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Escobar\u2019s story, this is a riveting (if not wholly realistic) look into the man, and the chaos he wrought upon an entire continent during his heyday. The third season follows a sister cartel after Escobar\u2019s death (uh \u2026 spoilers?). The popularity of the series even led to a spinoff series, Narcos: Mexico, which premiered in November. \u2018ON MY BLOCK\u2019 Saying that Hollywood has issues of representation would be the world\u2019s biggest understatement, but with On My Block, Netflix is working to remedy those issues. The show follows four high school freshmen \u2014 all people of color \u2014 in a witty, relatable coming-of-age story which culminates in some tensely dramatic moments. Monse (Sierra Capri) is a tomboy with deep-seated feelings for one of her close friends, Cesar (Diego Tinoco), who\u2019s trying to balance an unstable home life against the social demands of school and his feelings for Monse. Ruby (Jason Genao) is a whip-smart smooth talker, Jamal (Brett Gray) is a nerd on a quest, and Olivia (Ronni Hawk) is trying to make things work after her family is deported. The series treats ethnic and cultural divides with grace, showing how difficult it is to grow up as a young person of color in America. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I haven\u2019t watched a lot of \u201crecommended\u201d Netflix originals like Orange is the New Black, Narcos, House of Cards, The Crown etc. My recommendations are purely based on the ones I have.  #1: Stranger Things An absolutely wonderful show with a talented cast, a gripping sci-fi narrative, and wholesome entertainment. Stranger Things was a sleeper hit for Netflix and has propelled its young stars and creators (Duffer brothers) to fame. If you loved the horror, thriller, sci-fi movies of the 80s and 90s, you are in for a treat. #2: Daredevil and Jessica Jones (plus the broader Marvel TV Universe) Daredevil\u2019s first season was stunning. It literally was like a Nolan-esque TV adaptation of the Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s Kingpin is easily one of the most compelling supervillains brought to life. The addition of Jon Bernthal\u2019s Punisher to the mix in Seasons 2 and 3 was an added bonus. The same can be said of Jessica Jones which was more of a cop drama/crime thriller. Again, the primary villain of the introductory season, Jebediah Kilgrave aka the Purple Man, brought to life by the ex-Doctor, David Tennant was terrifying. The other 3 series are also decent for a one-time watch. Luke Cage\u2019s Season 1 had a really great first half, however, it sort of fizzled out towards the end. Luke Cage was lukewarm. Defenders was a decent first outing for the \u201cstreet-level Avengers\u201d. #3: Bojack Horseman I had been reading a lot on Reddit about the show and was fairly intrigued. Season 1 was OK, but they really kicked in up in the next 3. Needless to say, describing Bojack Horseman as \u201ca show revolving around an anthromorphic junkie horse, who used to be a famous TV star but is now just a bitter, cynical, self-loathing jerk\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice. Over the course of 4 seasons, the show has subtly addressed many issues that are generally brushed aside - the perils of child stardom, the ramifications of drug abuse, heartbreak, dementia, non-heterosexual relationships, a sneak peek into the lives of independent women, parenting. The 9th episodes of the seasons 3 and 4 had me in tears. #4: Rick and Morty I absolutely loathe the Rick and Morty fandom for how utterly obnoxious and unbearable they are, but that doesn\u2019t take away anything from the show. Loosely based on the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d premise, R&M is a wonderful binge-watch. #5: Big Mouth This popped into my recommendations when I finished R&M and Bojack. And IMO (for all it matters), it is a fairly unique show dealing with the nuances of teenage years (and not the ones the Nickelodeon shows focus on). Unfazed and unabashed (with the occasional sprinkle of fourth-wall breaking humor), Big Mouth talks about the more tabooed side of the teenage spurt years - masturbation, discovering one\u2019s sexual identity, the first awkward kiss, the perils of porn addiction, young relationships in the age of social media etc. I wish BM was around a decade and a half back. #6: Wet Hot American Summer (First Day of Camp + 10 Years Later) I loved the goofy old camp movie and when they decided to do a prequel as well as a sequel series to it, I couldn\u2019t resist. Both the series are 8 hours of nonsensical fun. #7: F is for Family Another show where I didn\u2019t expect much. You might get the occasional Simpsons or Family Guy vibe from it. But FifF has its unique niche and does a good job of portraying the family dynamics in the 80s.  P.S. I have heard great reviews about Mindhunter, Friends From College, GLOW, Master of None, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and plan to soon watch them. Hemlock Grove was also a decent watch but I could not keep up after the second season. Finally, the stand-up show, The Characters is a refreshing change for the fans of the live comic scene. ",

            "answer_text": "Tbh there are a lot of series in Netflix which are bang on . The online streaming service is really making its presence felt in the cinema industry . And many filmmakers believe that it is snatching audiences from their industry . And it is true, a lot of people would prefer lie on their asses and stream this service rather than actually going to the theatres. Okay so A2A NOW MY FAVOURITES SERIES WHICH YOU CAN STRAM ON NETFLIX ARE RIGHT NOW - 1.MINDHUNTER- do you know who is David fincher? If you do I do not need to tell you anything just go and watch it it's season 2 will be Available in sometime end of the year so now is the perfect time to watch this series. 2.house of cards - what do you think if Kevin Spacey and David Fincher come together after the amazing movie Se7en ? Yeah including Robin wright this series is all about politics and even if you don't like politics just stream it you will like it. 3. American vandal. Okay so this is maybe the most unusual series in this list but trust me it's really that good not a lot of people watch it is donno why but it's amazing with an outstanding fresh score from rotten tomatos with 97% it's worth the watch .. 4. Better call Saul . Did you liked breaking bad? Ofcourse you do who doesn't liked the amazing Bryan Cranston role of Heisenberg. This show is also brought by Vince Gilligan . And it's amazing. 5 . Daredevil . Marval fan? Don't worry NETFLIX got your back in this one . With a whole other universe of luke cage , punisher, Jessica Jones, iron fist and daredevil But this series as the name suggests only concentrates on daredevil who is a lawer at day and crime fighting vigilante during night. 6. Crown - with its slow pace you may feel a little dizzy during the start but as soon as you understand the characters depth and feel the fact that it all actually happened later on show the series picks up its pace and goes amazingly. 7.stranger things- Stephen King yes the creator of movies like shining , it and the green mile brings this series with stange place with strange things happening to not that strange people , if you like supernatural then just go and stream it now. 8. Sacred games . It's an Indian show in hindi but you should watch it if you want to see good cinematography and good direction by both the directors Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane and amazing acting by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. 9. Narcos- Pablo Escobar okay tbh the less you know about this one the better it is for you. 10. Masters of none - the only comedy genre serie in this list starring Aziz Ansari it is loosely based on Ansari life incidents he plays a role of Dev and one of the best things are the camera strategy of the d.o.p (director of photography) it feels naturalistic and refreshing . Hope you like the series in the list . Thanks for reading. leave an upvote if you have watched any of these series. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say any that look interesting to you. Netflix doesn\u2019t often make low-quality content. I\u2019ll offer my favorites, since I know about them. Marvel\u2019s Daredevil - Dark, gritty and violent, but also smooth and sleek. Very well made vigilante series. Basically a poor and blind(ish) Batman. Marvel\u2019s Iron Fist - After I watched this, I was really surprised by the poor reviews it go. The psychology in it is so good. It\u2019s an action-oriented show with focus on bastardizations of martial arts customs, but they did the psychology so well. The main character, Danny Rand was taken, as a child and after a hugely traumatic event, to a city where he was taught to avoid and repress his emotions. When he comes back, he\u2019s a mess. Still basically the nine year old he left as in a lot of ways and it shows. More than that, when he gets frustrated and can\u2019t communicate effectively, I got frustrated with him, because of how masterfully the scenes were manipulated. Marvel\u2019s The Defenders - A culmination of Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones with just enough of each of them, just enough of each of their supporting characters, a mostly great plot (I had one issue that bothered me enough to mention it exists) and none of the polarizing plot points that any of them may have. If you like any one of them, I imagine you\u2019ll very likely enjoy this. Marco Polo - Unfortunately this gem was cut short, ending after season 2, due to production costs being so high, but that cost definitely shows. Very fun and interesting fictional take on the real-life explorer. It\u2019s got a spin-off short movie for one of its characters titled One Hundred Eyes. Medici - I consider this an attempt at being a spiritual successor to Marco Polo, but it definitely very much has its own identity. It\u2019s very fun, engaging and self-aware. to include a wonderful, subtly humorous scene between Richard Madden and David Bradley. Frontier - A take on the Canadian frontier of colonial North America. It\u2019s a pretty interesting plot made to appeal to teenagers as much as adults. It\u2019s got a darkness and aggression to it that I feel is similar to BBC\u2019s Luther. Mindhunter - A very charming and fun show that takes on the 70s efforts into expanding psychology and doing away with social stigmas of even talking about certain topics. Specifically, the main characters are FBI agents who travel around the country talking to remarkably well portrayed real-life serial killers to gather information on the psychology that causes people to become serial killers, but also tackles other topics that were and are very much taboo. Castlevania - This one\u2019s a bit iffy. It\u2019s anime styled, which wasn\u2019t an issue for me. I often find myself wishing there were good anime, because I like the animation style. So, this was a pleasant surprise in that regard. The biggest issue with this is the pacing. It\u2019s very much made for binge watching, but only offers 4 episodes for the first season. Otherwise it\u2019s great. A well told story based on the lore of the long-running game series of the same name. Pretty cool vampire meets amazing woman and things get crazy from there. Fuller House - It basically just makes fun of everything. Especially itself. Easiest and most comfortable thing I\u2019ve found to watch since Roseanne. ",

            "answer_text": "Netflix is making the vaunted Nielsen television rating system obsolete. It is is forcing cable companies to change the way they do business. When Netflix began competing with TV networks directly for original content, it became a more attractive destination for showrunners and script writers because it offered upfront contracts to create an entire season or two. This led to some pretty amazing TV series being launched which changed how we saw TV. House of Cards - IMDB Rating - 9.0 - Frank Underwood is a Democrat appointed as the Secretary of State. Along with his wife, he sets out on a quest to seek revenge from the people who betrayed him while successfully rising to supremacy.  Black Mirror - IMDB Rating - 8.9 - An anthology series that revolves around a group of people's personal lives and how technology manipulates their behaviour. It is centred around dark and satirical themes that examine modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. Each episode is a different story. Each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now \u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.  Stranger Things - IMDB Rating - 8.9 - When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, goes missing, she launches a terrifying investigation into his disappearance with local authorities. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, unnerving supernatural forces, and a very unusual little girl.  Narcos - IMDB Rating - 8.9 - The gritty drama begins with the early days of the drug battle, when the biggest offenders were \"hippies in flip-flops\" caught with up to a kilo of marijuana, continuing to the violent, bloody battles between members of the cartel peddling tons of kilos of cocaine and drug agents from Colombia, Mexico, and the U.S. -- a struggle estimated to have cost at least 4,000 lives over two decades.  The Crown - IMDB Rating - 8.8 - The series begins with an inside look at the early reign of the queen, who ascended the throne at age 25 after the death of her father, King George VI. As the decades pass, personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries are revealed that played a big role in events that shaped the later years of the 20th century.  Marvel's Daredevil - IMDB Rating - 8.7 - Blinded in an accident as a child, Matt Murdock uses his heightened senses as Daredevil to fight crime on the streets of New York after the sun goes down. While Murdock's day job requires him to believe in the criminal justice system, his alter ego does not follow suit, leading him to take the law into his own hands to protect his Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood and the surrounding communities.  Making a Murderer - IMDB Rating - 8.7 - Exonerated after spending nearly two decades in prison for a crime he did not commit, Steven Avery filed suit against Manitowoc County, Wis., and several individuals involved with his arrest. Shortly after, however, Avery found himself behind bars again, this time accused of the murder of 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach. She was last seen on Avery's property, where she was to photograph a vehicle. Avery and nephew Brendan Dassey were tried and (spoiler alert) convicted of the crime. But that's not the end of the story.  13 Reasons Why - IMDB Rating - 8.6 - Two weeks after Hannah\u2019s tragic suicide, a classmate named Clay finds a mysterious box on his porch. Inside the box are recordings made by Hannah -- on whom Clay had a crush -- in which she explains the 13 reasons why she chose to commit suicide. If Clay decides to listen to the recordings, he will find out if and how he made the list.  BoJack Horseman - IMDB Rating - 8.4 - A humanoid horse, BoJack Horseman -- lost in a sea of self-loathing and booze -- decides it's time for a comeback. Once the star of a '90s sitcom, in which he was the adoptive father of three orphaned kids (two girls and a boy). The show was the hottest thing around, then suddenly, was canceled. Now 18 years later, BoJack wants to regain his dignity. With the aid of a human sidekick and a feline ex-girlfriend who is his agent, he sets out to make it happen. But Hollywood is vastly different from those days, and getting used to stuff like Twitter may take some time.  Sense8 - IMDB Rating - 8.4 - Eight strangers around the globe find themselves connected -- first by a violent vision, then by their shared ability to connect with one another's thoughts and actions, and finally by the urgent need to find out what happened and why. Their need to know goes beyond simple curiosity -- as they pursue answers, a mysterious organization hunts them down, intent on destroying them.  Master of None - IMDB Rating - 8.3 - Aziz Ansari plays the role of Dev, a New York-based actor who is struggling to identify what he really wants, both personally and professionally. The series reveals glimpses of Dev's younger years, and explores current aspects of his life, including modern etiquette (regarding texting and social media), and being young and single in the city. Other important people in Dev's life are featured, including Dev's dad, played by Ansari's actual father.  Orange Is the New Black - IMDB Rating - 8.2 - Ten years after transporting drug money to Alex, Piper is imprisoned for the crime. The toughness of prison changes her drastically as an individual, compelling her to do the unthinkable.  Marvel's Jessica Jones - IMDB Rating - 8.2 - When a tragedy puts an the end to her short-lived career as a superhero, Jessica Jones settles in New York City and opens her own detective agency, called Alias Investigations, which seems to be called into cases involving people who have special abilities. Suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, Jessica wants to do good, but her primary interest isn't in saving the world, it's saving her apartment and getting through each day.  A Series of Unfortunate Events - IMDB Rating - 7.9 - The tragic tale of three orphans -- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire -- who are investigating their parents' mysterious death. The siblings are saddled with an evil guardian named Count Olaf, who will do whatever it takes to get his hands on the Baudelaire's inheritance. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling devious plans and disguises.  These are the very best that Netflix has got to offer viewers. House of Cards, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Narcos, Daredevil, Making a Murderer, BoJack Horseman and Orange is The New Black are must-watches!!!  Sources: Wikipedia & Google Images ",

            "answer_text": "Bojack Horseman It\u2019s hard for me to pick one favorite Netflix original, but if I have to, then it\u2019s Bojack. At a glance, this looks like another adult animated black comedy drama, except It\u2019s not. I\u2019m hooked with the main character, Bojack Horseman (brilliantly voiced by Will Arnett) since the pilot. Never thought I\u2019d say this but the adult topics (mid-life crisis, abusive parents, fatherhood, and fame goes wrong) are just too deep, it makes me thinking about life.  You\u2019ll love it because: the celebrity cameo is more fun than The Simpsons. Some of them voice their own characters (even Sir Paul McCartney!) Some \u201ccameo\u201d have really funny names.  Don\u2019t get me started with a spider director named Quentin Tarantulino.. For more fun: 136 Hidden Jokes You Probably Missed On \"BoJack Horseman\" LOVE Nothing special about the girl meets boy plot, but the two main characters are too different (imagine Napoleon Dynamite meets Julia Stiles\u2019 whiny character in 10 Things I Hate About You). The juxtaposition is very interesting to watch. Judd Apatow is one of the creators. Great cast too. What\u2019s not to LOVE?  The Crown We have seen many portrayals of the Queen, from Helen Mirren to Kristin Scott Thomas, but I have never seen a series dedicated to explore further about the Queen\u2019s life. So when Netflix released The Crown in 2016, I tried to watch it in two or three sittings. Turned out it\u2019s pretty challenging because every time I finished an episode, I browsed the historical facts and awed with the accuracy. I\u2019m a sucker for history, so knowing it has many historical details, I took my time to do historical check after finishing every episode. It doesn\u2019t disappoint.  You\u2019ll love it because: the cast are amazing. Go to this video at 6:00 to see how Alex Jennings who played Edward VIII imitated the original speech accurately, even the pauses!  Big Mouth  No series on Netflix talks puberty more than Big Mouth. This adult animated coming of age is one of series that I wish I watched when I was a teenager. It covers menstruation, sexual arousal, basically something we all can relate. This should be featured in How to Survive Puberty kit for teenagers. Errr.. or maybe not really since it\u2019s rated NR. You\u2019ll love it because: the female hormone monster is voiced by Maya Rudolph! Everything Sucks!  Spoiler alert: it doesn\u2019t suck at all. Took place in Oregon, 1996 it tells about students life in Boring High School - yes that\u2019s the name. Pay attention to the cool soundtrack (from Oasis to Weezer) that will take you time travel to the 90\u2019s. It has a good lesson about finding your sexuality in teenage years too. Definitely something the young generation need to watch. Fun fact: the popular girl character is portrayed by Sydney Sweeney, Eden from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale! Mindhunter  Normally, crime drama is not my cup of tea, but when I heard it\u2019s directed by David Fincher, then I don\u2019t have any excuse to miss this one. It\u2019s based on a book written by former FBI agent. Personally, I can relate to Holden Ford\u2019s character, so it\u2019s really fun to watch and guess what he\u2019d do next. You\u2019ll love it because: The series features real serial killer characters and you\u2019ll learn more about the FBI investigating and interviewing techniques. Some scenes are too graphic for me, though. Master of None I have been a fan of Aziz Ansari since 2011. I religiously follow his stand ups and writing, so this is a no brainer.  There are actors like Zooey Deschannel, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter who no matter how hard they try, they end up playing themselves. Aziz Ansari is one of them. Not saying it\u2019s bad, because if you watch Master of None and read his book, Modern Romance at the same time, somehow you\u2019ll get the impression the series is a visualization of the book; they compliment each other. Fun fact: Dev\u2019s parents are Ansari\u2019s real life parents! Black Mirror Black Mirror is the most mind-blowing series I\u2019ve ever watched. For slow watchers, the good thing is you can watch the episodes separately. All episodes focus on technology. Some episodes hit too close to home, some are more outstanding than the others.  Tips from me: skip the first episode in the first season. You can watch it later, because it has different concept with the whole series and you\u2019ll get the wrong impression about the series if you start from that one. The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  Everybody loves a happy-go-lucky girl show, especially when there\u2019s a bit of musical and Ellie Kemper\u2019s in it. This is my go-to show when I spent 10 minutes on Netflix\u2019s homepage trying to find something relaxing to watch, thinking Amy Schumer\u2019s stand up is too much and I\u2019m not in the mood for Ozark either. You\u2019ll love it because: The talented cast, not to mention.. Jon Hamm in comedy! Gypsy  This psychological thriller drama is not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. The tempo is a bit slow, so I\u2019m not surprised to know Netflix canceled this series 6 weeks after its premiere. But considering it\u2019s been a long time since we saw Naomi Watts\u2019s brilliant acting in series, it\u2019s still a hidden gem. You\u2019ll still like it because: the soundtrack varies from Cyndi Lauper to Cigarettes After Sex! Orange is The New Black This prison comedy drama is based on the real Piper Kerman\u2019s memoir. The 16 Emmy nominations speak for the series itself. Solid cast and strong ensemble, no boring or so-so character. All characters are very interesting to watch, especially because each episode has a flashback of every character\u2019s background before they were in prison.  Why you need to watch it: Jodie Foster directed two episodes in season 1 and 2. The 12 greatest characters on 'Orange Is the New Black' The End of The F***ing World  Can\u2019t decide which one I like more, the story or the soundtrack. Graham Coxon wrote soundtrack for the series, definitely a must watch for Blur fans. The cinematography is fascinating, the color palettes are beautiful, it\u2019s like the love child of Wes Anderson and Valencia Instagram filter. While for the story, it\u2019s either you like it or hate it. Music from The End of the Fucking World Season 1 The Alienist  This psychological thriller drama is set in NY, 1896. In the beginning, I thought it\u2019s just like another Holmes-Watson crime investigating drama. It\u2019s not. Besides Daniel Bruhl\u2019s character who is basically Sherlock without sense of humor and dark personality, the series actually explores more on psychological aspect. Watch it because: the set is breathtaking (the crew built a replica of NY in Budapest), not to mention the costume..

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of options to select from when you consider watching NETFLIX specially after NETFLIX has burst into the TV and movie Production scene. The following are highly recommended TV shows. ( I am going to exclude House of Cards ) Daredevil: For obvious reasons this show is considered as one of the greatest modern day comic book adaptations on small screen. The show is rich in drama, suspense, Action, Character Development and for all other purposes has a commendable acting performances from their lead cast. (USP : I found the use of lighting in it very interesting)Master of None: A complete switch-over from the previous one, great content reeks in each and every episode of master of none. The character development is phenomenal and you seem to care for everyone you see on screen. The stylization of each episode is awesome. And the acting performances from the lead cast is also very good.Black Mirror: Based on near future experiences of mankind where the integration of technology into human lives is the matter under the spotlight. The writing of each episode is very tight and is a great visual experience with thought provoking central material inside each episode.The Crown: If you like good acting chops, Claire Foy will pretty much seal the deal. A good representation of the 50s and very good performances by their cast is the thing to cling on.The following list contains shows worth your time, but i could not elaborate on them. BoJack HorsemanSense8Stranger thingsNarcosHouse of CardsJessica JonesOzark13 reasons whyMaking a murdererJessica Jones.Although some people find The iron fist and other defender series good, i would not recommend. also the list is not ordered by rank. they all are great shows and are worth anyone\u2019s time.

            "answer_text": "STRANGER THINGS Season 1 begins with four kids playing \u201cDungeons and Dragons\u201d in one of their basements . On their way back, one of the kids go missing and as they search for the missing kid, extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, supernatural forces and an unusual little girl are unraveled.  The perfect blend of fantasy and sci fi. The 80s element not only brings back the sweet memories of simpler times but also decreases the chances for loopholes in the plot to some extent. It redefines the overused concept of alternate dimensions and monsters by bringing a scientific aspect and makes all of it further interesting by adding the adequate mix of supernatural element in it. Currently, the series has three seasons and Netflix has recently confirmed the release of a fourth (and possibly final) season. THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE Hugh and Olivia Crane move into the \u2018Hill House\u2019 with their children intending to sell it and and build their own house. However, due to unexpected repairs, they are forced to stay longer and start experiencing paranormal phenomena, resulting in Olivia\u2019s death and the rest of the family fleeing the house. Years later, they are reunited and the tragedy strikes once again.  It is not the best horror series I have ever watched or anything but it does have something in it that captivates your interest since the beginning. It doesn\u2019t have an awful lot of jumpscares, so if that\u2019s what you are looking for, this may not be the right one. The plot develops rather slowly, but once you have gotten a strong grip on the characters and how their stay in the house affected each of them personally, the story begins to make more sense. This one has got only one season. Fortunately for the fans, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, titled \u201cthe Haunting of Bly Manor\u201d. It will not be a continuation of the original plot though. I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS Sydney Novak, a 17-year-old teenager living with her mother and younger brother, navigates the complexities of high school, family and her sexuality, while dealing with her new-found superpowers.  This one gave me Stephen King\u2019s \u201cCarrie\u201d feels. It is, in fact, awfully similar to the novel, yet unique. The series is captivating in its own special way. Nothing spectacular yet gripping. It expresses well how hard a teenager tries to fit in a crowd that labels her as an outcast, while having to deal with the emotional stress and anguish of losing a loved one as well as dealing with a set of powers she never knew she had. Although no official announcements were made about a second season, it had a pretty open ending. So, there is definitely hope, I guess. LOCKE AND KEY After their father\u2019s murder, three children move to their ancestral home, filled with mysteries involving reality-altering keys and demonic entities.  Yet another Netflix Original that takes you into a whole another world where demons and keys that can influence reality exists. To be honest, this one didn\u2019t leave much room for character development. Then again, there were too many things that they had to squeeze into the plot in limited time so that the plot makes sense, so I can\u2019t really complain. Somehow, it was still captivating enough and the ending was not at all disappointing. It got the one thing right that most of the others get wrong - the ending. Netflix recently confirmed a second season. 13 REASONS WHY Hannah Baker, a troubled teenager, commits suicide. Weeks after the tragedy, her classmate, Clay, receives a box of recordings made by Hannah explaining the 13 reasons that prompted her to take her life. The mystery unravels as Clay goes on listening to the tapes and comes to know how he became one of the 13 reasons responsible for her death.  The plot focuses on disturbed teens while trying to unveil the mystery behind the rapidly increasing rate of teen suicides. Season 1 was definitely gripping, but I think they pushed it too far by releasing the other seasons with the not-so-great plotlines. (Maybe, they just got carried away by the overwhelming response they received for the first season or whatever). Also, one of the major flaws that found with the plotline was that the story progresses in such a way that even the viewer feels like Hannah had no choice but to kill herself, which is definitely not the kind of message that they should be giving out, particularly when their target audience includes teenagers. Presently, the series has three seasons and the fourth (and final) one is about be released soon. SHADOWHUNTERS Based on Cassandra Clare\u2019s bestselling novel, the story follows the journey of Clarissa Fray, a shadowhunter (part-angel, part-human), who hunts demons. After her mother gets abducted, she is forced to deal with the shadow world and everything that lies within. She relies on fellow shadowhunters, Jace, Alec and Isabelle as well as her childhood friend Simon on her quest to rescue her mother.  Personally, I felt that Lilly Collins gave a better performance as Clary in the movie version of the same. It is not like Katherine McNamara was not convincing in her portrayal as Clarissa Fray. But, when there is someone else who portrayed the same character, you are bound to be compared with each other. If you are looking for something that does justice to the books, sorry, this is not the right one. They have altered the plotline too much for that. It is still worth watching, for the drama, romance and whatnot. The ending was not satisfactory, but limiting the entire plot of the fourth season to a two-hour-episode could not have been that easy. MONEY HEIST (La Casa De Papel) A man recruits eight people in his quest to conduct the world\u2019s biggest heist in history - to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint Of Spain. Things go out of hand, when an investigator, who is just as clever as the mastermind behind the heist, takes up the case.  First of all, this one is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea and you have to be patient for the first few episodes to get some insight into the plot. It is highly entertaining, but, I am sorry, I don\u2019t get what the extreme hype is about. So, if you prefer a series that goes on with the story of a heist, lasting several seasons, Money Heist is exactly what you are looking for. ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK A privileged New Yorker finds herself in a women\u2019s prison when a past crime catches up with her.  I am watching it right now. So far, so good. Apparently, it has got seven seasons. So, if it is not interesting enough, I won\u2019t be giving a review. If you are looking for Netflix Original series, this is pretty much it, as far as I have seen. ",

            "answer_text": "The kind of content that Netflix offers is quite great. There are a couple of things that I have watched on Netflix pretty recently which have made me go gaga over this website and forced me to subscribe it yet again after the month\u2019s end because why not! It\u2019s so entertaining...ahhh! Anyway, coming back to the point, some of the things that are a must watch on Netflix are listed below. And also, um I am not giving out spoilers so it's pretty safe for you to scroll down and give this a read! Lust Stories- OMG!!! I cannot tell you how enthralling this Netflix production is because you can derive multiple interpretations from this! I mean, there are so many sides to look at in a one hour thirty minute film and I bet, you will sit with your mouth open by the end of every story that is featured in it. Just to give you the jest of this, it talks about the stories of 4 different women and the events they encounter. 2. To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before- If you are bored watching the mainstream rom-coms, Netflix has to offer you something not-so-cheesy and yet so cheesy which will make you go awww by the end of it. So yes, DO NOT miss this cute love story of an Asian girl and a white boy!  3. Love per Square foot- You are so going to love this! The script writers have done pretty good work, guys. And if you need a reason to watch it- then that reason will be Vicky Kaushal and Angira Dhar. Their performance will leave you pretty amazed fosho.  4. Tu Mera Sunday- I am not sorry for recommending one more rom com because duh! It\u2019s soooo peculiar and so different. Do i need to say more? No right?  5. Zindagi Gulzar Hai- This Pakistani TV series (though not from Netflix) will definitely change your outlook towards your life and guess what, you will cry by the end of it. In fact, you wouldn\u2019t want it to end only!  6. I Feel Pretty- This one\u2019s for all the people out there who are utterly conscious about the way they look and are facing excess number of insecurity issues. You will probably want to thank me for recommending this when you finish watching it.  7. Yeh Meri Family- They don\u2019t lie when they say that family love is the true love. This series by TVF is different not because it provides you a fresh outlook on Family but because it based in the 90s. If you are a 90s kid, you are going to LOOOOVEEEE it!!  8. Stories by Rabindranath Tagore- Last, but not the least, if you are a Literature student and you love reading Rabindranath Tagore, then I am dead sure that you will enjoy watching this. You really have to give this a shot!  Well, that\u2019s all I have watched folks! Please keep the recommendations pouring in the comments section!

            "answer_text": "The difficulty with answering this question is that everyone has different tastes when it comes to what they like/dislike in a TV show. There are lots of Netflix hit TV shows, but that\u2019s an easy list to look up. All I can do is give my personal recommendation of some I\u2019ve watched and enjoyed. (Not in any particular order btw). Stranger Things: This is a sci-fi/horror show that\u2019ll remind you quite vividly of Stephen King\u2019s work. It also draws from lots of 80s nostalgia, and plays on a lot of the common tropes found in hit movies like the Goonies and E.T. It\u2019s got a great cast, particularly the child actors. Hemlock Grove: This is an already finished horror/fantasy show. It\u2019s hardly my favorite that I discovered on Netflix but if you like the genre it\u2019s got a pretty interesting take on some of the folklore. It\u2019s very dark, and no one is really heroic in it though, so be prepared for that. Marco Polo: A historical drama where everyone is a lot prettier than they probably were in real life lol. It is NOT historically accurate, but a sort of dramatic retelling of events. So if that bugs you, it\u2019s a no-no. The performances, costumes and sets, and action are really good altogether. Unfortunately, it did get cancelled, so if you don\u2019t want to get invested, that\u2019d make sense. Sense8: Another cancelled show. It\u2019s a sci-fi show created by the makers of the Matrix movies, and is honestly the best thing they\u2019ve come out with since. It\u2019s got a very unique plot, difficult not to give to much away but let\u2019s say it has to do with a sort of psychic connection-It also has lots of government conspiracy stuff, if you like that sort of thing. The cast is great and it\u2019s very much original in it\u2019s concept and presentation. Grace and Frankie: Fantastic comedy staring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in the titular roles. Also stars Martin Sheen and Sam Waterson. It\u2019s very funny, but also filled with lots of heartfelt moments. I was able to binge this very quickly, which is rare for me. It\u2019s still going too, several seasons (4, I think, lol) into it. Frontier: I\u2019m still working on this one, only recently discovered it so I can only talk about the first season so far. It\u2019s a historical drama about the fur trade in North America during the 1700s. It stars Jason Momoa, and Landon Liboiron (who is also in Hemlock Grove, hence the name drop). It\u2019s quite well done. I have no idea the level of historical accuracy but again it\u2019s rather gripping. It\u2019s also been renewed for a third season, so it\u2019s not as difficult to \u201ccatch up on\u201d than some others would be. Longmire: This originally aired on A&E, but Netflix picked it up a few years ago and it\u2019s final season (5th, I believe) was just released. It\u2019s based off of a book series, and is essentially a modern Western about a sheriff out in rural Wyoming (as if there\u2019s a non-rural Wyoming lol) who\u2019s involved in all sorts of mysteries. It\u2019s fantastically acted imo, and well-written. Good action too, and it\u2019s nice to see a genre that\u2019s rare today represented and modernized. I do think the first three/four seasons are the best personally, but it\u2019s still good. And yes, I still have to finish the last season, but only cause I promised my mother I\u2019d watch it with her :D Making a Murderer: You might have heard about this in the press a bit. It\u2019s a documentary about a true crime case that is still actively going on today. It\u2019s highly controversial, but a very interesting watch if you\u2019re interested whatsoever, of course. Saying anything more would give too much away. Now I\u2019d like to mention the Marvel Netflix shows. Obviously, if you\u2019re not a Marvel fan, or a comic book fan you won\u2019t enjoy these, but if you are, especially if you\u2019ve watched the Marvel movies, I\u2019d recommend all of them to one degree or another. Daredevil: Has two seasons done. Very good overall. Lots of action and well written. I never cared for Daredevil too much but this show made me care. Love the side characters. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio portrays a very menacing Wilson Fisk to perfection. Jessica Jones: Honestly, I didn\u2019t enjoy the first season too much apart from the best of the Marvel Netflix villains, Kilgrave, portrayed by the always great David Tennant. I\u2019ve come to like the titular character more overtime though. Jessica Jones is more of a private detective who just happens to have super powers. Luke Cage: The weakest imo of the Marvel shows, but there are still good parts of it, especially in it\u2019s performances. Again if you like the genre you\u2019d probably still enjoy it. Same goes for\u2026 Iron Fist: Definitely the most sloppily put together of the shows, unfortunately. This one caused some controversy and division. You\u2019d have to basically ADORE Marvel/comic books to watch it and be guaranteed to like it. The Defenders: This is a special mini series in which the characters of the previous four mentioned shows team up to defeat a big bad. Essentially, it\u2019s Marvel Netflix Avengers. Obviously, don\u2019t watch unless you\u2019ve watched at least some of the others. You\u2019ll face at least some level of confusion if you don\u2019t watch them all but you\u2019d need to watch at least both seasons of Daredevil to get the most. The Punisher: My personal favorite and the most recent. The Punisher is a vigilante with no qualms about killing. He first appears in Season 2 of Daredevil. You wouldn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to watch that in order to understand this show but you\u2019d be missing out on a lot of great acting and back story. Jon Bernethal is wonderful in this part and this one is the most realistic and heart wrenching by far. ",

Dark - I was like WTF when I started watching this series. It is a mind blowing, amazing, freaky series. If you love mystery you can watch this series. I had to search web for the story and plot after completing the first season. It was difficult to understand the story - NetflixSherlock - Every one like Sherlock so it's obvious I like it - NetflixThe punisher - I think it is the most underrated series in Netflix. It is actually pretty amazing. The way he acts i.e., no fear, ruthless, terrific acting by Joe Bernthal is amazing. But unfortunately Netflix cancelled the series after amazing 2 seasons due to the Disney+ launch by Disney. It is a marvel superhero series - NetflixMindhunter - It is again a series that is so different. Obviously we love crimical case solving but this series delves into the psychology of murder. It is full of talks by the way. If you want something different to watch it is one of them - NetflixSuits - Now we enter the corporate world it seems. It is about a group of lawyers and case solving blah blah blah. I like the character \u201cHarvey spectre\u201d Netflix or Amazon prime.Money heist - It is a trending series during the lockdown period. I finished the 4 seasons in a single day. It was different, I would not say best series but definitely a good one. I liked the second heist than the first one - NetflixHouse of cards - Oh god, If you love politics you would definitely like House of cards. It is how Kevin spacey's Presidential adventure takes a dig and how he solves the problems he's facing. I loved the series, there were many places in the series I got goosebumps - NetflixAs the list is getting big I will just say the likable series iI watched on Netflix - Peaky blinders, sex education, Ragnarok.

            "answer_text": "My favourite Netflix Original is Sense8. It's written by J. Michael Straczynski (creator of Babylon 5) and Lily and Lana Wachowski (creators of the Matrix). It's about a group of 8 strangers across the world who suddenly become linked telepathically, sharing their thoughts, emotions and skills. They help each other out of various problems while also contending with a corporate/government conspiracy that looks to capture and vivisect them. The show is hard going to begin with, it drops you in at the deep end and asks you to follow 8 simultaneous plotlines, each with three or four unique characters - but around episode 4 everything clicks into place. The show has this incredible vibe of positivity around it which is a real breath of fresh air, especially in SF and Fantasy TV which is frequently grim and gritty, but at the same time remains exciting. I'd also recommend: Orange is the New Black, which is a comedy/drama set in a women's prison. Its based on a book of the real-life experiences of a woman named Piper Kernan, who was arrested as a minor part of a drug smuggling ring with her then-girlfriend, though years after she was involved. The show is entirely fictional after the initial setup, and it follows the lives of the prison inmates, frequently flashing back to their time outside and shows what lead to their arrest and sentencing. Master of None, a sitcom written by and starring Aziz Anziari, about an Indian actor living in New York, dealing with topics like family relations, espcially the cultural gap between people who migrated to the West from impoverished countries and their children, rascism, feminism and the trials of living with your partner. The two Marvel shows: Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Both are crime-centred stories set in the backdrop of the Marvel TV and movie universe. In Daredevil a blind lawyer with a superhuman radar sense takes to the streets at night, coming into contact with an organised crime ring run by the almost-mythical Wilson Fisk. Jessica Jones is about a super powered private investigator who's trying to suppress the months of her life she spent in the thrall of an amoral man named Kilgrave, who's able to control people just by talking to them. Even though she left him for dead when she escaped, he returns and she ends up in direct conflict with him. 2017 EDIT: Updated Lily Wachowski\u2019s name to reflect her coming out as trans. ",

The plot is complex, unique and enticing with the themes of politics, power and superiority built seamlessly into it. The fourth wall breaks give us an insight into the character in a way not done before and makes it a thrilling ride. The Crown (2 Seasons) (2016 -) Historical Drama Budget Per Season: 130 Million Portrayal: 8.5/10Production: 9.5/10Re - watch - ability: 7.5/10Overall: 85 %This is a historical Drama so the plot is not very unique still the adaptation and portrayal by the actors is absolutely brilliant. Especially John Lithgow as Winston Churchill. The show brings the royalty of the UK royal family to the screen perfectly. Ozark (1 Season) (2017 - ) Crime Drama Budget per Season: 60\u201370 Million (estimate) Plot: 9/10Acting: 9/10Hook: 9.5/10Overall: 92%Honestly The best Crime drama on television reminiscent of Breaking Bad. The series is believable, gritty and wonderfully acted. Who knew Jason Bateman was a good dramatic leading man. His performance and the plot are great but what hooks me in is the way the characters are put in tough situations and forced to make difficult choices leading to unforeseeable consequences. Daredevil (2 seasons) (2015 -) Legal/psychological drama Budget per Season: 40 Million Adaptation: 8.5/10Action: 9.5/10Themes: 9/10Overall: 90%I believe this series is absolutely brilliant from its close to perfect adaptation, world class action and well stretched out characters. Both seasons have developed wonderfully with having religious and moral themes on the questions of right and wrong, hero and villain and when is a man morally justified to do something wrong. As for any upcoming original series I am excited for is: Hit and RunHit and Run will manifest as a more personally focused entry from Raz/Isaacharoff, centering on a happily married man whose wife is killed in a hit and run, which, on the surface, appears to be an accident. However, since Hit and Run is being described as a \u201cpolitical espionage thriller,\u201d expect the layers of this tragic onion to be peeled episodically with action and intrigue. With the series currently in development, creators Raz and Issacharoff serve as executive producers, joined by Peter Principato, Itay Reiss and Kimberlin Belloni from Principato-Young Entertainment and David Hoberman, Todd Lieberman and Laurie Zaks from Mandeville Films.[1] This synopsis really gets me excited plus it is from the guys behind the Fauda which is another great show. The Rain The official synopsis from Netflix is: \u201cThe world as we know it has ended. Six years after a brutal virus wiped out almost all humans in Scandinavia, two siblings join a group of young survivors and set out to find out whether a new world has begun somewhere else. They all hope that the siblings\u2019 father is somewhere out there with answers. Set free from the rules of civilised society, each of the young members of the group has the freedom to be who they want to be, but they all struggle with their own demons, and the fact that even in a post-apocalyptic world there\u2019s love, jealousy, coming of age, and every problem they thought they\u2019d left behind with the disappearance of the world as they knew it.\u201d[2] This seems like a slow burn dramatic, thrilling and engaging sci-fi mystery story and I am excited for it.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. There is some seriously good stuff on Netflix. Stranger Things. There are 3 seasons of this Duffer Brothers masterpiece of a sci fi show set in regional town in US in the 80s. The show appeals to teenagers and people who lived in the 80s. Its got a great music score, the cast is adorable mix of fresh young talent and old veterans from the 80s like Wynona Rider. It\u2019s about strange disappearances of local town folk due to a secret US military facility in town and some local teenagers solving the mystery and saving the day with help from their adult families later. The writing is fresh and action packed. It has something for everyone. You end up thinking the show cannot get any better and season three comes along and blows you away with the introduction of 80s shopping malls, Russians, and return of the teenage and adult hero\u2019s to save the US and the world. Stranger Things I can\u2019t see how they can top the endin* of season three but I hope we see a season 4. Season 3 features an adorable, clever and hilarious use of the Never Ending Story theme song. This show will charm your socks off.   2. Orange is the New Black. A well written and casted show which survived 7 seasons. Set in a US Federal Women\u2019s prison in roughly current time features a hilarious and dramatic look at life inside the prison with the relationships between inmates, the correctional officers, and rival ethnic and other factions and prison politics. Plenty of nudity, sex scenes, lesbian relationships and focuses mainly around our main character inmate Chapman and her life inside. I didn\u2019t think I would like this show but it\u2019s addictive Orange Is the New Black | Netflix Official Site  3. The Crown. This is a drama/mocumentary about the British Royal Family. It is a lavish production which wreaks of big budget sets and international travel. It starts off with events leading to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation and marrying Prince Philip. Seasons one and two are perfect. Very true to history with some artistic licence to fill the gaps. Prince Philip is played by former Dr Who Matt Smith and the young Queen Claire Foy. The cast changes across the seasons as the Royals age. Season one and two are essentially the same lead cast with a young Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth and younger Princess Margaret and her relationships. Season 3 is more about a more mature queen and her adolescent children and older Princess Margaret. I prefer Seasons 1 and 2 and would consider them to be perfect. The essence of the young Royals is captured perfectly. Netflix's 'The Crown' has replaced its cast with new actors. Here's how they compare to the original stars.  4. Sex Education. This is gold. Set in an American style high school which could be anywhere, but with British cast, it depicts a teenager whose mother is a sex therapist. The main character lad absorbs his mother\u2019s advice and offers counseling to his school mates so they can succeed in their relationships with other love interests. Naturally, life in a school is complex and what if you start giving advice to someone who could bash your head in and you also share an interest in the same young woman? This is a brilliant show with a cast who are easy to like. The story is very clever and you will fall off the chair laughing. Has Gillian Andersen and many other fresh faces. Sex Education (TV Series 2019\u2013 ) - IMDb   5. Good Girls. This was something we found as a time filler between seasons of other shows. It\u2019s a gem in its own right. Features an all star cast. It\u2019s about women whose situations find them being in abusive relationships and barely able to make ends meet to escape their situations. The women, all mothers, perform a one time favour for a crime syndicate laundering counterfeit money. They do so well at it they decide to stay on and find themselves caught up in the syndicate making enemies and getting deeper and deeper in the murky underworld. Worth a watch. You will be hooked. It\u2019s hilarious and very dark.   6. Travelers. Canadian produced and Written by Brad Wright it features Erik McCormack (Will and Grace as the lead) as well as many talented veterans and fresh faces including beautiful Mackenzie Porter and many familiar faces as well pop up along the way. Humans and an artificial intelligence in our apocalyptic future discover how to send the minds of special Traveler agents back through time into people of the 21st century, in an effort to correct the path of humanity and events leading to demise of western civilisation. The consciences sent back In time are able to inhabit the minds of living people, targetting people just before their known historical deaths. The hosts carry in their lives with the Travelers in control of their mind and bodies. One episode features a traveller who is inserted into the mind of a sky diver only minutes before the host is going to die from a skydiving accident and the rest would spoil the plot as it\u2019s one of the cleverest episodes and makes good use of the time travel concept and repeated attempts and reattempts to save the incoming traveler. The show has many subplots focusing on character development, their relationships with other Travellers as well as their inherited hosts relationships which can distract them from mission objectives. Not only do the travellers have to carry out their missions that are sent back to them for the future to perform but have to convince friends and family of the host bodies that the original hosts haven\u2019t changed and appear to live their normal lives avoiding attention. The show feels really well made. iThe scripts are good and plot never dull. It has a mix of established and fresh faced actors who are easy to like or dislike if you are meant to\u20263 brilliant seasons. i hope there are at least one more but if not, it\u2019s finished on a high note. One of the least appreciated shows on Netflix. Some similarities to Continuum but this is much better. Travelers (2016-2018)    ",

Great character, direction, acting, cinematography. Two things I like most about the series - Firstly their choice of using Spanish language with English subtitles which gives it a authentic feel. I even picked a few basic sentences and cuss words of spanish. Secondly when you know that this is not a fiction rather dramatization of real events makes it an exhilerating watch. In fictional story you know anything can happen but I never knew such dramatic events could happen in real life.  2. Black Mirror We often hear how technology can dominate our world can have negative consequences in future. Black Mirror shows how dark can the future be. Each episode explores a different aspect of futuristic technology. What makes this series so enticing is that they are not looking for Star wars kind of future, they are just telling how the technologies we are using today are going to create severe ethical and moral dilemmas in future. Must watch.  3. Mindhunters Talking to serial killers and trying to know their psychology. How do they choose their target, what triggers them, is their a pattern in their killing, what is the role of their upbringing in making them what they are and do they feel any remorse for what they have done. Mindhunters is a series about program of FBI in 1970s and 80s which helped in developing our understanding of serial killars.  4. Master of None A refreshing and light-hearted comedy. Raises many issues about gender, disability, sexuality, immigration, religion, dating etc. in a non-preachy way. Aziz Ansari is great and so are other cast members.  ",

            "answer_text": "Netflix has brought the famous show \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d to its streaming site. The Tony award-winning play has travelled from the theater to the small screen, but the core magic of the story is intact as the entire cast returns again to entertain us all. While the show directed by Joe Mantello and produced by Ryan Murphy may feel like a stereotypical story of tall handsome men, but the cast involved in the Broadway film holds much more significance than that. The Broadway special play was actually based on a play directed by Matt Crowley who relayed the humorous drama story about the marginalized community and its struggles. Crowley\u2019s play was met with a tragic end as almost the entire cast of the play lost their lives in the \u201980s and \u201990s due to the health crisis. The modern adaptation of Crowley\u2019s play, \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d, is special for a lot of reasons. It not only pays tribute to the extraordinary talent of the marginalized community who unfortunately lost their lives to a cruel disease, but it also inspires the young generation to be confident and proud. Furthermore, the entire cast has their own separate fanbase that will help create social awareness even more. From Big Bang Theory\u2019s Jim Parsons to The Sinner\u2019s Matt Bomer, let us see who plays what in the film. Jim Parsons plays the role of Michael. You may know Jim Parsons for his role as the internationally renowned character \u201cSheldon Cooper\u201d in the American sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d He portrays Michael in the play and in the film. Michael is the best friend of Harold and their fights are humorous to watch.

            "answer_text": "Whenever I hear Netfilx the next thing which comes to the mind is waking up whole night to complete that one last episode! Netflix originals are fully filled with action and suspense which makes them worth to wake up whole night and watch them\u2026. Out of many Netflix originals these are the three best series according to me! 13 Reasons Why?: It's a story about a girl who commits sucide and some how states her 13 reasons through tapes which she records to confess why she did so! The best part is season two is coming on 18 May 2018!!! Now don't tell me that I didn't recommend you this when you were Alive! :p 2. Narcos:  Narcos is a series which portraits how drug narcotics used to operate and how they expanded their business even though they were on the top of priority list of FBI. 3. Stranger Things:  As the above picture shows\u2026it's not that horrifying! It's a story of few kids who used to live in a town of America and were keen to study science back in 1980's. They used to communicate with each other by changing the frequency of radio. They had the coolest childhood one could imagine. And then some twist and turns and plots came into the series which led them to the upside down ! Don't know what \u201cupside down\u201d is? Go watch Stranger Things\u2026 I'm not going to give you'll any spoilers! Ps: Its very different from the Upside-Down world of Taarak Metha :p Life is too short to watch all TV Series! </enjoy>\u00a0",

            "answer_text": "All of these answers are obviously subjective, but there\u2019s a good list developing. I\u2019ll limit myself to Netflix Originals, because as great as The Good Place is, if it\u2019s licensed, it can go away any time. That said, because Netflix produced the fourth season of Arrested Development, I think that the first three seasons (which are far superior) will be streaming for a while. A good mix of smart and stupid humor. For good family suspense, you can\u2019t beat Stranger Things. I\u2019ve written elsewhere on how it was a great family bonding experience. If you like superhero stuff, season 1 of Daredevil and Jessica Jones both had some great performances. Right now, the show I keep telling people about is American Vandal. It\u2019s a parody of true-crime shows, but it\u2019s more than that. Like any of these recommendations, watch one episode and decide if it works for you. Finally, Netflix is producing a lot of standup specials. I like Mike Birbiglia and Dave Chappelle and Rory Scoville, but one of the funniest is the 25 minute set by Nate Bargatze from The Standups.

            "answer_text": "Yesterday was significant. In this dreary abyss of endless quarantine time passing in a strange, warped like fashion \u2013 I finally managed to do something I felt grateful for when it ended. I saw the season 2 of the British dark-comedy show Afterlife.   Its a story about a man in his 50s, Tony Jones, whose wife, Lisa, dies from cancer. Theirs was an amazing marriage, the \u201cbest one possible\u201d as he so promptly describes several times in the show. He is absolutely shattered as a result of it, as Lisa was the single best thing, his only accomplishment according to him, in his life. The couple and their German Shepherd, Brandy, lived in small-town called Tambury in East Sussex, England. He works as an employee in a 6-member team of Tambury Gazette, the local newspaper printing ridiculous stories no one really cares about. His easy-to-go and generally happy nature takes a colossal hit when his wife dies, and he turns immensely suicidal. He only manages to not pop in an entire bottle of sleeping pills because of his dog, who comes to him whenever she hears him crying over videos of his and Lisa\u2019s life together before she died as well as video recordings she secretly made for him in the hospital. The dog, Brandy, is quite intelligent and understands that Tony is considering harming himself and barks, jumps, and whines incessantly until Tony keeps the bottle of pills away. He claims several times in the show that if not for the dog, he\u2019d have killed himself by now. He also decides to live long enough to punish the world for existing (while his wife is dead) by doing and saying whatever he feels like, but it gets tricky when his friends try to save him from this downward spiral.   Tony and Brandy Tony also visits his aged father, Ray, who\u2019s suffering from advanced Alzheimer\u2019s, every single day in the local Care Home. Ray doesn\u2019t even recognize him most of the time, but in the Care Home is where he meets Emma, the nurse who takes care of his father. They hit off, but Emma tells him that he\u2019s obviously and understandably still very much hung over his wife and that she cannot pursue a relationship this way. They continue to meet every day in the Care Home but don\u2019t start a relationship. When Ray dies, at the end of season 2, Tony realizes he cannot enter into a relationship with Emma without feeling as if he\u2019s cheating on Lisa, and Emma fully understands that. After Ray\u2019s funeral, Tony suggests that they can continue like this, seeing each other every day like this without \u2018labeling summat\u2019, in a manner of Groundhog day. It is a difficult proposition for Emma, who is reluctant due to the more-than-friendship but less-than-commitment nature of his proposition, but she later comes around and agrees to the \u201cGroundhog day\u201d. This bit is portrayed beautifully in the show and makes you root for them all through the show.   Tony and Emma Tony\u2019s newspaper office has Matt, his brother-in-law, and close friend, as his boss whose marriage is crumbling apart. His coworkers include Kath, the attractive, superstitious advertising head who has a crush on Matt; Sandy, the new 20-year old new journo-in-training who lives with her sick, non-working parents and depends on this job as a crutch from her miserable life; Lenny, Tony\u2019s best friend and colleague with whom he goes to people\u2019s houses to cover nonsensical stories for their newspaper. Visuals of stories Tony and Lenny cover \u2014 a 50-year-old man who imagines himself as an 8-year old school girl and dresses up as such, much to the displeasure and distress of his wife and daughter; or an aged woman whose claims of how she can communicate to cats after her husband and daughter died are a juvenile way of telling her unhappy story to the world; or a 90-year old man who\u2019s so blind he ends up putting his mail in a dog shit-box for a year and is despairing and lonely over not having received a response from a long-distance friend of his \u2014 are quite peculiar to watch, bringing to Tony\u2019s attention as well as ours to how much of a masked sorrow there is in everyone\u2019s life and struggle is omnipresent and to the extent people tend to become powerless and helpless as they get older. This eventually leads him to show compassion to others instead of constant resentful remarks.   Tony and his work squad Tony also befriends a sex-worker, Roxy, whom he hires to clean his kitchen(!) a couple of days after Lisa\u2019s demise, and who laters comes on to check in on him every day and listen to him reminisce about Lisa. He also meets a kind widow Ann in the graveyard where Lisa is buried. Tony shares updates on his life and his mental health with her, and she recalls her own experiences and imparts wisdom, insight, and perspective to him at a time when he needs it the most. She sort of acts as a therapist for him, listening to the daily happenings of his life and helping him grieve properly for his dead wife. Their conversations in the well-lit, scenic graveyard (Great use of symbolism, turning a place setting as gloomy and dispiriting as a graveyard into a place for new friendships and fresh perspectives) are extremely beautiful and inspiring. Ann is full of compassion and love towards life and she talks to Tony in a very patient and non-judging manner, guiding him to a life without his one true love. She also plays a role in helping him keep off killing himself and shows him that despite everything, continue to live is worth it and how helping and connecting to others will do him a ton of good.   Tony and Ann So, in a way, she acts as an usher to the theatre of his life, eventually affecting his behavior towards others, modifying them from bitter, While initially full of cruel and sarcastic remarks, bitter outlook on everything, and very understandable hatred of others and himself(on the pretext of them being alive, while his wife is very much dead), he begins to get a little bit better as his life continues. Like any sort of real progress over a massive tragedy in one\u2019s life, he often regresses and has a breakdown in his bedroom, watching Lisa\u2019s videos over and over again. The path to recovery is arduous and full of thorns and every day feels like a struggle to get through. And like any realistic portrayal of trauma, even at the end of season 2, he\u2019s very much suicidal as he was at the beginning of season 1. Very often you can be back to right where you started, or worse. The writing, direction, and acting are splendid, and the actor who plays Tony, Ricky Gervais, did all the three of those. It handles a subject as deeply sad as cancer and depression in a very sensitive yet up-front way and deals with the real-life tragedies of Tony as well as the others in his life in a very poignant manner and we cannot help but pause the playback for a few seconds and wonder at the brilliant words just spoken(very, very often by Ann) and we reflect at the sadness and pain in our lives and take away a lot of the wisdom imparted in the show while stealing away quite a few laughs because it\u2019s a dark comedy after all!!!   This show is especially healing for those of us struggling with mental health. The way the show transports us to the slow-paced small-town life of Tambury and it\u2019s modest, simple people and their common yet bigger-than-life struggles make you pause and reflect on the difficulties in your own life and how connected we all are to each other with the myriad challenges we face in our lives. It compels us to admit how a little bit of compassion can go an extremely long way at making each others lives better. Because eventually, kindness and compassion are what make life worth living in the face of monstrous setbacks and trauma.   This show will be one of the most touching you\u2019ll ever watch, and it\u2019ll sure as hell make the best of us tear up every now and then. Fin. ",

            "answer_text": "Netflix has done a fabulous job with the introduction of Netflix Original Series. Due to Netflix Original Series introduction, they are able to cover various genres and maintain content quality. For me three Netflix Original Series that have stand out in each of every aspect are. La Casa De Papel (Money Heist) - IMDB Rating 8.4/10. A Spanish series which was so successful that Netflix was force to dubbed it into English. First two seasons were so successful of Money Heist that the makers got permission of another three seasons from Netflix. Professor has assembled a bunch of crazy heads to pull of a robbery which no-one in the world could imagine. 2. Fauda - IMDB Rating 8.3/10.  Fauda is based on the conflict between the Israel-Palestine. The series is on a heavier side because it is based on some true events which have happened. 3. Narcos / Narcos Mexico - IMDB Rating 8.8/10.  Narcos is a perfect series to watch if you are interested in knowing about the life of Drug Lord Pablo Escobar, Cali Cartel and the Mexican Drug Lord Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo. The series shows how did each of the Cartel rose to power and what all fuck ups they did, which ultimately resulted in their downfall. Thank you. Kindly Upvote, Share & Follow Irfaan Rangwala ",

            "answer_text": "Alexa and Katie. Not many TV series have a storyline revolving around Cancer. That too definitely not a comedy series. -No Spoilers Ahead- It is a beautiful sitcom that helps you understand what goes on in the mind of a cancer fighter/survivor and the people around them. Cancer is already such a sensitive subject and to portray it in a sitcom revolving around high school, without going overboard on the humour or the pain element is a really difficult thing to do. And this series does that beautifully. Sure there are lots of artificial elements and some over the top humour, but how else do you humour-coat cancer yet get the struggles and the victories through? It also shows how deep friendships can run and how it does not just affect an individual, but everyone around them. The best thing about the show is how it shows cancer as a phase of your life that you can outgrow, but a phase you need to be wary of through all your living days. This series is really a must-watch in the Indian context because support groups for cancer fighters/survivors are difficult to come by. And support groups for the families of people with cancer doesn\u2019t exist. This series will enlighten you beautifully how much space you need to give the patient and how much you need to keep away. It might not focus too much on the physical aspect of things, but it does a really good job of demonstrating the emotional aspect in a non-serious but effective way. It also shows the need to prove yourself after you have come out of this ordeal because you are always left feeling like Cancer took a major part of your life and how you are no longer the person you used to be. It deals beautifully with how difficult it is to really talk about it even though you know kicking cancers butt was probably the bravest thing you ever did.

Warning: spoilers for seasons 1\u20134 and early season 5 SEASONS: 5 EPISODES: 52 RUNNING TIME (or whatever the f it was called): 24mins SUMMARY/PLOT: This show follows an orphan called Adora (around 17/18 at the start of the series and 20/21 at the end of it), who has grown up in the Horde (one of the forces of Etheria, the planet they live on, the other being the Rebellion). Until one day after crash-landing a skiff in the Whispering Woods she finds a magic sword that transforms her into the mythical warrior She-Ra. She met one teenager (Glimmer) and a guy around her age (Bow) and they tell her about the Horde\u2019s evil doings. Adora then makes a decision to leave the Horde and join the Rebellion. Favourite episodes from each season: S1: The Battle of Bright Moon. An amazing finale to cap off the first season. While Adora, Glimmer, and Bow\u2019s attempt to reform the Princess Alliance failed, the Horde charged in with a battle. The rest of the princesses charged in too, and soon realised that \u201cteamwork makes the dream work\u201d. S2: Roll With It. This episode was also about teamwork. Adora, Glimmer, Bow, and the rest of the princesses wanted to formulate an attack plan on the Horde, but each of the princesses had their own idea. Finally, they decided to use all of them, to amazing results. S3: The Price of Power. Fabulous season premiere, so funny too. Some memorable phrases include: \u201cYou must be Glimmer\u2019s mother. I can tell by the way your voice grows shrill when you scream.\u201d \u201cHow dare you!!\u201d S4: I have many favourite episodes in this season, including Protocol, Mer-mysteries, Hero, and Fractures. I also liked the season finale, where Adora was able to break her sword. I already knew that, in like five episodes\u2019 time, she was gonna obtain a new one (coz I already searched it) S5: This I cannot decide as I have not finished the season yet. But one of my favs was Stranded I hope you like this show. ",

            "answer_text": "Black Mirror, all seasons of it.  After years I followed everyone to watch mainstream series, like GOT, Stranger Things, 13 Reasons Why, etc. I finally found my own favorite series without following everyone who watched mainstream series (all Netflix series are good though, but Black Mirror is brilliant.) This series is indescribable. Out of words. Just brilliant and amazing. When I found Black Mirror, I was amazed like, where the hell I have been? Didn\u2019t I so late watching it in 2017\u20132018? I watched it in only a few days in a row from S01 until S04. Just a few days, less than a week. Because it was just so good. What to say and describe? Each episodes aren\u2019t connected with each other. Each episodes tells us about the future. This firstly seems impossible to be happened, makes no sense, but if we reflect it to our life nowadays, man.. this can be happened and possible! And a conspiracy account which I followed on Instagram recently posted this  Sounds familiar? Yes. It\u2019s like the \u201cNosedive\u201d episode in Black Mirror S03E01 if I\u2019m not mistaken. And there are still a lot of predictions from Black Mirror that can possibly happen in the near future, read this: https://www.businessinsider.com/black-mirror-predictions-reality-2016-10 Overall, I\u2019d rate Black Mirror 10/10 for the outstanding story. Beyond great, intelligent, and brilliant. Well, everyone supposed to have fun while watching series, runaway from stress and depression, but Black Mirror will add your confusion. It gives you goosebumps, you\u2019ll be scared of future, yet you\u2019ll be ready, and you\u2019ll be confused, but Black Mirror is worth to watch! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your country as to exactly what is available. Bojack Horseman, a cartoon about a horse-man named Bojack who made it big with a sitcom in the 1980s and has never really managed to be a star since then. A show that does go to some dark and depressing places, but also has a lot to say about psychology and how we do things. Orange is the New Black: A show about a woman who goes to prison for drug smuggling, and looks at the flaws in the American prison system. Stranger Things, basically \u201cwhat if we made a Speilburg movie set in the 80s, but stretched it out to a TV series\u201d If you enjoy superheros and the MCU, all their shows are pretty decent (though many people dislike Iron Fist and the Defenders because it was mostly about Iron Fist) In particular Jessica Jones is an amazing series with one of David Tennant\u2019s best villain roles. A Series of Unfortunate Events - a great adaptation of the Lemony Snicket books of the same name, with Neil Patrick Harris in the villain\u2019s part. I must caution you that these are perilous and dark tales that no rational person would even think of infliciting upon themselves, and would urge you never to consider doing so due to the acting, great visual effects or stirring displays of triumph over adversity, a word which here means Count Olaf. Altered Carbon, an adaptation of the SciFi novel of the same name. This one contains a fairly large dosage of nudity, violence and cynical outlook so fair warning. Money Heist is an incredibly tense thriller of a series, about a group of criminals in their year-long plan to rob the Spanish mint. Netflix has subtitles if like me you don\u2019t speak Spanish. ",

Unfortunatly it got cancled just as it got really interesting The crown, oddly compelling, as historys often are Some older shows, such as breaking bad, sons of anarchy, and even weeds(which is fun but likes to jump the shark quite a bit) or nurse jackie You'll probably notice that the main thing all of these shows have in commen is that they are serials, each episode builds in the last. My prefered medium for staring at a screen. Also this list is by no meams exhaustive.

            "answer_text": "I recommend the original Brazilian Netflix series called 3%. The language is in Portuguese with the options of having English language dubbed in or subtitles. I just finished seasons 1-3. The show is about a future Earth with an impoverished inland and a luxurious island called the Offshore that individuals have the opportunity to become residents of if they pass all tests in a competition called the Process when they turn 20 years old. During the Process, the 20 year olds go through various critical thinking and other tests set up by officials of the Offshore. Candidates either pass or fail each test. Those who pass all tests go to the Offshore, but at a cost-they need to be sterilized first, since the Offshore requires it. Only 3% of the 20 year old candidates pass all tests and make it to the Offshore. Those who fail the Process are stuck on the impoverished inland forever. The Offshore is attractive to the inlanders, since it has resources that are not available or in low supply on the inland such as clean drinking water, a large variety and supply of healthy food, technology, medicine, low crime rate, good housing, and a pleasant environment. This show has a great cast of dynamic characters with unique personalities and interesting flashbacks to the past. Ezequiel is the Offshore official who leads the Process that the main characters of Michele, Joana, Rafael, Fernando, and Marco participate in. Michele and Rafael pass the Process and are transported to the Offshore via submarine, while Joana, Fernando, and Marco don\u2019t pass and remain on the inland. Michele, Rafael, Joana, Fernando, and Ezequiel were all previously involved with the opposition military group on the inland called the Cause. The Cause opposes the Offshore\u2019s greediness in not sharing its resources with the needy inland, believes the Process is unfair, and rebels against it. The Offshore has its own militia led by Marcela to fight against the Cause. After working very hard to pass the Process to get to the Offshore, Michele and Rafael realize they don\u2019t fit in with the Offshore\u2019s philosophies and eventually both decide to leave the Offshore. Michele creates a third community called the Shell in the remote desert. The Shell\u2019s motto is everyone is accepted and nobody is rejected (unlike the Process which rejects people from going to the Offshore). The Offshore is against the Shell and its militia tries to sabotage and take control of it. When the Shell\u2019s residents learn the Offshore sabotaged it, they fight against and defeat the Offshore militia and regain control of the Shell. This show is full of action, drama, mystery, and unexpected twists/surprises. I look forward to the final season 4 in August 2020 to see if the Shell will defeat the rest of the militia on the Offshore to bring an end to the Process and restore peace and fairness for everyone.

Midnight Diner is an anthology which presents human connection in the most amazing way. Set in Tokyo, Japan this series is about a late-night-diner (that opens from 12 am to 7 am) where the characters frequently visit and their life stories unfold there.  The official trailer of \u2018Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories\u201d You instantly fall in love with the Master (owner) of the diner and the atmosphere his place has. The characters that visit him make a place in your heart without even making you realize it. And their stories make you realize that irrespective of the countries & cultures we live in, we are all the same and life treats humans similarly in a different way at different places. You fall in love with their stories and feel happy by when an episode ends. If you have ever read books by Japanese authors you already have an idea of how simple yet beautiful Japanese storytelling is. And this series is a perfect example of it. If you want to watch something different than the usual stuff out there, watch this series. If you want to have 30 mins of your life spent on learning more about human emotions, watch this series. And if you want to fall in love with the Japanese (people, food, culture, storytelling) watch this series. PS: The series is in Japanese with English subtitles. But you will love it anyway.

But let me just throw one more no one has talked about yet, and which is clearly a masterpiece:  BoJack Horseman. There you go. Watch it, at least finish season 2, I guarantee you'll be into the show by then. It is by far the best animated TV show there is right now (to be fair, Rick and Morty isn't that far behind) . If it's not, it is at least the best written one. I don't want to seem too fanboy-ing, and I don't want to spoil you anything. I can only say that you will not have wasted your time watching it. Oh. And the character of BoJack has got a Twitter account that is quite fun following, once you've seen the show. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with my favourite:  Trollhunters is a Netflix/Dreamworks collaboration that is both created and executively produced by Guillermo Del Toro, and stars Anton Yelchin (in his final role), Kelsey Grammar, Mark Hamill and Tom Hiddleston. I would recommend watching the first two episodes to see if you are interested. Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency:  The 2-season show stars Samuel Barnett and Elijah Wood in their respective roles as the story takes turns of combining the elements of shows Doctor Who with Disney\u2019s Once Upon A Time on a sci-fi detective story, whose main character relies on his uncontrollable ability to relate things to each other. The first episode should be able to satisfy your interests. And finally, F is For Family:  This adult-oriented animated Netflix show focuses on the story of Frank Murphy, a former US veteran who participated in the Korean War and now feels cursed to live with his family. The first season takes some getting used to, as it features some pretty heavy themes involving verbal and drug abuse. Overall, the show manages to maintain its interest over the course of two seasons and would recommend it if you are in the mood for something verbally violent. ",

The Last Kingdom - I can\u2019t explain how much I love this series, just absolutely great. Limitless - a guy takes a drug that gives you \u201csuper-intelligence\u201d and ends up immune to the insane after-effects, but this creates a few problems. Frasier - yeah, I know, old show and \u201ceh\u201d show for a lot of people, but I used to watch the boxed sets over and over, love it. 3% - hard not to like this one, I loved the first season especially with the tests, the second season is also pretty good. Star Trek - self-explanatory for the most part Narcos - based on a true story, and just a fun watch A Series of Unfortunate Events - I love that its characters are supposed to be dumb, and the children are the only smart ones, plus it\u2019s a pretty good story with fun characters. Little Witch Academia - light-hearted and cute series, one of my favorite series overall. Bob Ross: Beauty is Everywhere - you know why I chose this, I love watching Bob Ross paint and talk, it\u2019s just relaxing. ",

Created by the Duffer Brothers, the show stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, and a whole gang of soon-to-be child stars. To call it a good series on Netflix would be an understatement. It is, objectively speaking, one of the best TV shows ever made. Paying tribute to cult classic horror movies of the \u201880s, Stranger Things is so much more than just a good a show. The series starts with the disappearance of Will Byers. It then focuses on three groups of people, all trying to get the little boy back. His friends, his mother, and his brother all try to figure out what happened to Will. But things become even more complicated when the kids find a little girl escaped from a secret laboratory. The second one is Sherlock 1 /2 /3 /4  Some of the most famous good TV series on Netflix, Sherlock is a crime/drama TV show based on the famous detective stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The series is starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson. This good Netflix series is a modernized version of the famous Sherlock story. The action is taking place in 21st century London and follows Sherlock as he works his talent while solving crimes and fighting his fierce enemies. ",

But when the chips are down Bojack can be counted on to make the wrong choices, let his pettiness or insecurity do the thinking for him.

As well as Bojack there's a great cast of supporting characters \u2013 Mr Peanutbutter Bojack's constantly cheerful old sitcom rival (a Labrador), Princess Caroline Bojack's agent and former girlfriend (a cat), Vincent Adultman (three kids in a trenchcoat who date Princess Caroline), Wanda Pierce (an owl played by Lisa Kudrow), Neal McBeal the Navy Seal.

The serie is keeping you on the edge of your seat the complete two seasons. Last couple of episodes are a bit weird, but I loved it.Daredevil. Brilliant Netflix original serie. Just finished the second season and a third season is inevitable. When you have had enough of all the superheros like Superman and batman, try Daredevil. This blind superhero is like all of us. The constant excitement is triggering.Prison Break. Michael Scofield and his 'friends' were fantastic. From start to finish a fantastic serie to watch. Some pieces of the serie are a bit boring, but it's always comming back on track.Other series I liked: The mentalistHavenPerson of interestthe BlacklistSuitsHouse of CardsThe KillingThe Following",

            "answer_text": "Drama- Alias Grace Based on a Margaret Atwood novel, this compelling mystery series involves a real murder case from the 1840s, a case that obsessed the citizens of Canada for decades. Sarah Gadon is striking as Grace, who may or may not have been complicit in a somewhat ghastly crime. You want to believe her, but something holds you back. Her luminous blue eyes seem to be hiding something.  Comedy- Santa Clarita Diet Hilarious sendup of Zombie tropes. Drew Barrymore and the supporting cast are terrific, but the real surprise in Timothy Olyphant, previously known for portraying strong, rather dangerous characters. He\u2019s a scream in this thing, delivering throwaway lines that land with riotous impact again and again.  Documentary- Dirty Money Eye opening series about corruption in capitalism and what it\u2019s costing regular folks. It gives you a blueprint that clearly puts into focus things you might have suspected, but couldn\u2019t quite correlate due to information overload. This incisive exercise in film journalism brushes aside much of the smoke and mirrors and goes for what\u2019s at the heart of various economic injustices and inequities.  ",

            "answer_text": "I personally enjoyed watching these ones! The Crown: Originally just watched it for Matt Smith, but stayed for the story and Queen Elizabeth\u2019s journey. Love the atmosphere of the era, the clothing, and the character struggles. Overall, the episodes were also beautifully shot.Girlboss: Main character was a very interesting person, couldn\u2019t decide if I liked her or not until halfway through the season. It was inspiring to watch her journey of starting her own business. I also loved the friendship between her and her best friend, their banter. The dialogue in general was hilarious to me. Very emotional ending, sad to hear it was cancelled :(Las Chicas del Cable: Foreign series in Spanish (although English dubs are available), I loved watching it in the original language with subtitles. I\u2019m Filipino and our language is heavily Spanish-influenced and I just loved hearing words that I understood and that our language still uses! Story-wise, it had different character plotlines that were fun to follow, although the drama did get a little cheesy sometimes.Just realized the shows all have female-centric storylines, which is a huge plus for me. In terms of picking the best, it\u2019s difficult to pick because I enjoyed each of them for the different reasons outlined above. ",

            "answer_text": "Delhi Crime We have experienced the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, we have all been affected by it. Now it's time to hear it form the point of view of the police who caught these rapists. The series is an accurate description of the police and their struggles in coping with an increasing hostility against them after the heinous crime. The police caught all six accused in five days. In 2012, we were so quick to blame the police. But it is also important to realise that they are nothing but the products of an underpaid, overworked and underemployed system. We assume all police officers are snobs lazing around all day in police stations. We assume DCPs and Police Commissioners are corrupt fraudsters who would do anything for a few bucks. This image, although true in a few cases isn't universal. In fact, I believe there are far more sincere police officers in the country than there are the insincere, corrupt snobs. Delhi Crime tells us the stories of the good cops, those who work for five days straight, who stay with the victims until the case is solved and those who travel around the country to catch the accused. The psychology of the rapists behind committing this crime is also addressed. The lack of proper sex education, socio-economic barriers and a misogynistic mentality make them vulnerable to committing such crimes without regrets. The actors have done a wonderful job. The series shatters our perspective, and compels us to think, making it a must watch.  Today Nirbhaya's rapists breathed their last and I would like to thank the police officers who did their job right. ",

It's Just spoiled entire plot and Hannah Baker Character. Jessica Jones too was very well written, especially the killgrave character and his performance at high peek. Season 2 was quite boring. Riverdale season 1 was awesome but season 2 was bit dragging with 22 episodes where as season 1 had only 13 episodes. These are my favourite Netflix originals watched recently. ",

The show presents the story of Pablo Escobar, the most known cocaine dealer and one of the most wanted men in the 80\u2019s.  The first season starts by presenting how the drug lord created his empire and the continuous race to between him and the Colombian government. I don\u2019t want to over-promote it, but I will assure you it will worth watching. For more plot summaries, check out this article. If the first 2 seasons focused on the life of Pablo Escobar, the third one is about the Cali Cartel story and how Pablo\u2019s men want to change the way they do business. As for the 4th season, rumors say that it will follow the nowadays Mexican cartels war with the American government. I personally am not that hyped about this change, but it may change into a good refresh of the series. ",

House of Cards is more clever, Orange is the New Black is more funny, The OA is more visually impressive, Love is more down-to-earth and has better characters. But Stranger Things, in terms of pure entertainment value, is better than all of these. The story isn\u2019t very original, the characters tend to be a bit caricatured and made for convenience, and the style seems to have been the focus over the plot. But that doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s brilliantly executed and is an absolute delight to watch. The direction is superb, the actors are all fantastic and I\u2019ve never been drawn into a series as much in my life. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s damn fine entertainment. ",

The sociopathic Joe (Badgley) develops obsessive crushes, stalking his victims as he woos them, and inevitably digging himself a hole that he (and the women he follows) can\u2019t get out of. And weirdly enough, this show is kind of\u2026funny? Just trust us. \u2018Dead to Me\u2019 Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini star in Dead to Me, a dark comedy about a recent widow who makes an unlikely friend at a grief support group. Season 1 is a wild ride whose final episode left us reeling \u2014 so catch up now before Season 2 hits Netflix in May. \u2018Hollywood\u2019 Ryan Murphy\u2019s long-awaited Hollywood is finally here, showing you Los Angeles in the 1940s like you\u2019ve never seen it. As usual, he focuses his story on those historically disempowered, and looks at what happened to women of color who tried to carve a place for themselves in Hollywood. ",

The jokes were funny and weird. At the same time, the show made some smart observations about what it\u2019s like to try to be an adult and act \u201cgrown up\u201d. I\u2019ve heard complaints that the characters aren\u2019t likable enough, but I found them to be quite relatable. I like that the show has characters who are both flawed and endearing. My favorite character is Nick. I don\u2019t want to get too much into spoilers, but there\u2019s a moment where my heart breaks for him. Despite having a trust fund and a propensity to date younger women, he is just as capable of having emotions and getting hurt. ",

Thusi\u2019s hope (and that of others) is that this series, which goes into production this year, will alter Africa\u2019s place on the entertainment landscape. Sono features Thusi as a secret agent who juggles crime fighting with the ebb and flow of her personal life. Thusi, who also starred in the ABC-TV show Quantico, will be reunited with director Kagiso Lediga and executive producer Tamsin Andersson, both South Africans. The trio previously worked together on Catching Feelings, a romantic drama.

That's the job of FBI agents Holden Ford and Bill Tench. They attempt to understand and catch serial killers by studying their damaged psyches. Along the way, the agents pioneer the development of modern serial-killer profiling.

It\u2019s a bit like Game of Thrones in space, but with way less violence and nudity and death in general (altough still having a pretty high death toll). Its budget wasn\u2019t so high, and you can see that, but it makes great use of what it has. The few CGI-shots we get to see are gorgeous, and the set design is really cool, too. Season 2 has a higher budget, so we get more space battles and CGI-landscapes. I really love the story, even though the various arcs are hard to follow sometimes. The protagonists are interesting, flawed but still likeable (no Mary Sues here), and undergo some really nice character development. ",

Throughout the show I kept on switching sides which shows how compelling both the sides are and it also shows how sometimes people were compelled to believe what they were told and not the actual facts.

(season 4 trailer) Season 1 is a little slow to get going, but after that it gets good, and by season 3 you're in classic Arrested Development territory, with the actors well-established in their characters and bouncing off of each other, resulting in much hilarity.  Season 4 seems bad at first, but after 3 or 4 episodes, it's back to usual. It's a different format because the actors were busy and couldn't be together like in previous seasons (shot years earlier), but it was still pretty well done, if a little weird at times because each episode focused mostly on one character.

The movie by Netflix to generate their own content has been viewed by many as key to their ongoing success. Point to note - Netflix doesn't always create these Original Series from scratch, alot are based on novels, actual events etc etc If you are looking for examples then I recommend Van Helsing.

The first season is based on the murders of rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls in the late-1990s. The 10-episode season is titled The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G. and chronicles the dual police investigations of Detective Greg Kading (John Duhamel) and Detective Russell Poole (Jimmi Simpson) into the controversial murders of two of the rap industry's most legendary players, Tupac (Marcc Rose) and Biggie (Wavyy Jonez). I thought this show was well scripted, as well, the actors who played Biggie and Tupac were very convincing. The show helped to explain why the murders were, and still are, impossible to solve due to the constant issues and/or scandals along the way. The previous Tupac movie (All Eyez on Me) and Biggie movie (Notorious) were both pretty bad (and critic scores supported this) so I was finally happy to watch something true to the actual story with a much better script. I\u2019d highly recommend checking this out.  Ratings IMDB  Rotten Tomatoes  ",

The worst episodes are still better-than-average TV, and the best episodes are fantastic.
