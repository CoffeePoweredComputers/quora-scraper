            "answer_text": " Why did Andy Dufresne risk hiding his rock hammer in the Holy Bible that Warden Norton had given him? Well, it was probably an unnecessary risk, and certainly dangerous, but Andy knew the warden was a hypocrite who hid behind the Bible, but didn\u2019t actually believe in it. So, Andy kind of put a psychological lock on the Bible, by playing Norton\u2019s game of quotes back at him. Andy basically talked the warden out of opening the Good Book. Warden Norton: \u201cI'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages?\u201d (After the guards toss Andy\u2019s cell for contraband) Andy Dufresne: \u201c\u2019Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh.\u2019\u201d Norton: \u201cLuke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've always liked that one. But I prefer: \u2018I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u2019\" Andy: \u201cJohn. Chapter 8, verse 12.\u201d The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Norton had always to show his prisoners who was boss, and he couldn\u2019t stoop to looking inside the Bible, not after Andy quoted a passage from memory. It would have made Andy appear \u201cholier than thou,\u201d in Norton\u2019s mind, and therefore, more powerful than the warden, at least on a psychological level. The scene in question occurred when Warden Norton was *setting Andy straight* by having Byron Hadley invade his cell, reminding Andy he had no personal rights to privacy; Norton was preparing Andy for his personal use as bookkeeper for the illegal bribery schemes Norton was cooking up. All those religious passages the warden quoted and hung on his office walls, he used as a form of psychological power over the prisoners, none of whom could likely quote from the Bible to save their lives, despite most of them probably having some Christian background. Just the idea of the warden quoting the Bible had a condescending and demeaning effect on the other prisoners, who were already guilty according to the law, and were now reminded of their guilt in the Eyes of God, as well. The mental effect would make the prisoners feel even more guilty and weak. But, Andy was not guilty; that made him the exception to the rule, though Norton didn\u2019t realize this until later, and never really could admit it to himself, not until it was too late, and the only thing left between the warden and his own freedom was a bullet to the brain. It\u2019s particularly noteworthy that Andy handed the Bible, with his tool of escape, right to Warden Norton, hidden in the weapon of fear the warden employed the Bible as; it was the one place Hadley wouldn\u2019t think to look for a hammer, yet, there it was, right under both the warden\u2019s and the guard\u2019s nose, literally in their hands. It was a complete demonstration of their underestimation of Andy Dufresne. That was one of Andy\u2019s greatest strengths; that he let people assume weakness in him, that he had given up any hope, that he had no ambition to be set free. Everyone was innocent in Shawshank, after all, right? Their lawyers screwed them over. Andy let the warden underestimate him for twenty years, while Andy continued his relentless digging through the walls of Shawshank. Norton believed Andy to be a lost cause, the warden continuing to step on Andy\u2019s neck whenever he put Andy in the Hole, not realizing he was only waking, in Andy, the heart of a lion. Andy played a dangerous, but expert, psychological game of chess with Warden Norton, where Andy put the warden in checkmate because Norton couldn\u2019t look inside the Good Book for a passage, when Andy was quoting one from memory.

            "answer_text": "Actually, its a bit of a joke there from the propsmaster, Tom Shaw: the hammer is hidden there after the first page of \u201cExodus\u201d as a visual gag. [1]  Exodus in the Holy Bible is largely devoted to the Israelites leaving Egypt for the promised land, Canaan. So it\u2019s fitting as a tongue-in-cheek jab that Andy hid the tool that helped him escape prison in that chapter. It doesn\u2019t hurt that in the film, the singular warden for the film is deeply versed in the Bible and (pretends) to adhere to Biblical principles\u2026 so it\u2019s a nice double jab.   It\u2019s really more about dramatic effect than logic. The writer, Stephen King, or the screenplay writer, Frank Darabount, probably decided that there\u2019s more poetic justice if Andy hid the rock hammer in the one place that all the current warden valued the most. Logically, the tunnel is a good option\u2026 just not quite as much fun when it comes to dramatic effect. Footnotes[1] 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption",
