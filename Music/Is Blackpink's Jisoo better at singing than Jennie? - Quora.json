            "answer_text": "Well both of them are amazing singers with very different vocals techniques and voices but if you had to compare\u2026\u2026. (PS Jennie was just a vocalist before but now her position is also as the lead vocalist ) \u2192Lets start with Jennie(i am not a vocal expert but i\u2019ll try my best) So according to what i have heard from her voice you can clearly tell that she has a pretty strong voice that gives off a bad ass vibe. She sings from her stomach so a really powerful voice comes out, however she may sometimes sound a little breathy or not so stable. The problem is that when she tries to sing high pitch it sometimes seems like \u201cscreaming\u201d which she got a lot of backlash for, she also needs to work on her stability (her voice has improved a lot but it still may sound breathy) Best cover- Loser \u2192 Let\u2019s move on to Jisoo She has a deep and husky voice which is really soothing to listen at especially when she hits her low notes The Blackpink songs do not give her much justice, her range got versatile after a lot of training She is the stable queen she is because she uses the vocals from her head to nose which she has gotten control over the time. (she didn\u2019t have much control over her voice and it used to sound nasally but now she somewhat have gained control over her voice) So if I had to choose between Jennie and Jisoo\u2019s singing I\u2019d have to choose Jisoo I think that Jennie still has A LOT of room to improve ",

            "answer_text": "First off, BLACKPINK has equally amazing singers/rappers/visuals. All four girls trained extremely hard and worked to get where they are today. Also, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Everyone had different opinions on who they think is the pretties/best at singer/best at rapping. Moving on to the question, Is Blackpink\u2019s Jisoo better at singing than Jennie? Let\u2019s first compare the two voices. (I\u2019m not a professional vocal coach btw)  Jisoo: To me, she has quite a unique voice that I have madly fallen in love with lol. It is borderline raspy and deep, but it can also be high and clear. I love the versatility of her voice! Personally, I think that her deep and husky voice is soooooo beautiful and I could fall asleep listening to her anyday!  Jennie: Jennie, just like all the other girls, has a WONDERFUL voice. It has a really nice bad-a** vibe too it and also has versatility, like Jisoo\u2019s. However, she has a powerful voice, but it can also lead to her having a less stable and more gritty/breathy/airy(not the JYP style) type of sound. Nonetheless, sings more in the higher range as well, so props to her for having a powerful yet non-nasally voice! All in All: In my opinion, the winner is JISOO! Her versatility, her range, her power, and more has won my heart! Disclaimer: Both Jennie and Jisoo have wonderful, amazing, breathtaking voices. Quora\u2019s Anonymous Mouse is out! ",
