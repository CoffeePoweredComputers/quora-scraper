            "answer_text": "Depends on the artist\u2019s prices. Take drake and future. Together they did the Summer Sixteen tour in 2016, and hauled in a whopping $84 million dollars for 54 shows. Compare that to Kendrick Lamar, who did THE DAMN. Tour in 2017 and 2018. With 36 North American shows, his box office was 41.4 million (62.7 million all together). These are staggering amounts! Im thinking about making a song now. ",
