            "answer_text": "Playing an instrument seems to be repetitive when you first start out because repetition is one of the needed qualities for success. The learning curve is physical, intellectual, and emotional. To play an instrument, hand strength, dexterity, conditioning, and endurance are essentials. Daily practice is one of the best friends a beginning player can have. Repetition reinforces every aspect of performance and the player can easily become totally absorbed in the process. This is where success enters the picture. Both physical and mental memory is needed to gear up to the learning task. The job is not easy but the rewards are great. There are many players that learn tunes by ear and they have natural talent. They can blend their auditory skills with the academic challenge of learning to read and write music notation. Starting off with learning music with a mentor can hasten the musical adventure. A mentor can guide a player through the ropes of timing, technique, tonal expression, endurance, and finally, confidence. Without repetition as a foundation, the journey would take much longer and the road would be much more difficult. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. Choose your path and start walking. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is repetitive when you first start: A,B,C, over and over again. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is reading, ice-skating or cooking or playing the guitar. Get the Basics! Do them again, and then once again. As they say, you need to, \u201cget chops\u201d, wether with a knife or keyboard or karate. Make the basic moves automatic. That can only be done with constant repetition. Also, Repetition is not a punishment! It is a way of getting fundamentals becoming so natural and without thought, that you can move to higher orders, more complex creations, without thinking. That is where creativity begins\u2026 ",
