            "answer_text": "The song December, 1963 (Oh, What A Night) was recorded by The 4 Seasons. The song was originally set in 1933, with the title \"December 5th, 1933,\" and celebrated the repeal of Prohibition. The song was written by the original 4 Seasons keyboardist Bob Gaudio and his future wife Judy Parker. The lyrics were changed at the urging of Frankie Valli and lyricist Parker to re-position the song as a nostalgic remembrance of a young man's first affair with a woman, and, more specifically, Gaudio's courtship with his wife, Judy Parker.
