            "answer_text": " Weezer\u2019s \u2018Teal Album\u2019 is entirely made up of cover songs \u2013 and the band\u2019s fans love it. Atlantic Records To everyone\u2019s surprise, Weezer suddenly had a chart-topping hit \u2013 its best performing single in a dozen years. And it isn\u2019t even the band\u2019s own song. Now Weezer has released an entire album of covers \u2013 a self-titled EP affectionately known as the \u201cTeal Album,\u201d which has already hit No. 5 on the Billboard 200. As a musicologist, Weezer\u2019s successful foray into cover songs made me think about the overall trajectory of the practice. They\u2019re usually a fun way to memorialize an existing song and pass it along from one generation to the next. But the practice isn\u2019t free of controversy. Enriching our collective musical memory The editor of a book on cover songs, communication scholar George Plasketes writes that covers are \u201cabout favorite songs and great songs. Classics and standards.\u201d They show how \u201cmusical artifacts are kept culturally alive, repeating as echoes.\u201d To Plasketes, regardless of what a musician might add or subtract in the process, cover songs capture and convey a collective musical history. The concept of covering has been around as long as music has been written down. The earliest choirs for Catholic masses often sang versions of earlier Gregorian chants. These \u201ccovers\u201d were intended to both teach and entertain \u2013 to attract worshippers and spread Christianity. Then, as now, covers circulated culture. Scholars have identified many categories of cover songs, but people are probably most familiar with two of them: the \u201cstraight cover\u201d and the \u201ctransformative cover.\u201d The former, also known as a \u201ckaraoke cover,\u201d sounds almost exactly like the original, which is the route taken by Weezer. Such an approach might pay homage to a music influence, like The Beatles\u2019 \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d which had been popularized by The Isley Brothers but was originally recorded by The Top Notes. A straight cover can also form a sort of ironic commentary. Cultural theorist Steve Bailey notes that, while such covers \u201ctend to ridicule the originals,\u201d they also \u201ccelebrate the continued vitality \u2026 of the music and its importance.\u201d Certainly, there\u2019s a dose of irony to Weezer\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d \u2013 the band recorded it at the request of fans, not necessarily out of some deep connection to the music or as a nod to Toto\u2019s influence. We can\u2019t be certain, but it seems as if Weezer\u2019s poking fun at the \u201880s hit, while still staying true to the original. More frequently, covers fall into the transformative category, which is when musicians put their artistic stamp on a song. Consider a hit such as Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d Houston was able to transform Dolly Parton\u2019s original country song into a pop anthem. Then there\u2019s Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect,\u201d which famously flipped the gender dynamics of Otis Redding\u2019s original \u2013 all of a sudden it was a woman asking \u201cfor a little respect when you get home.\u201d The contradictions of the cover It\u2019s fun to hear one performer emulate another or to experience a familiar song made anew. But the question of \u201cwho gets to cover whom\u201d reveals one problematic aspect of the genre. As white rock 'n\u2019 rollers usurped black rhythm and blues artists in the 1950s, countless covers became known not as covers, but as the definitive version. Did you know that Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cHound Dog\u201d was originally performed by rhythm-and-blues singer Big Mama Thornton? Or that Bill Haley\u2019s \u201cShake, Rattle and Roll\u201d was first recorded by blues shouter Big Joe Turner?  These two versions are especially emblematic of the issue. Not only are the covers safer, less-sexualized renderings geared to a white teenage market, but their subsequent popularity severed the songs\u2019 original associations with their black creators. Elvis and Haley earned millions of dollars off of this appropriation. Few hear \u201cHound Dog\u201d and think of Big Mama Thornton. On digital streaming platforms and automated playlists, cover versions of popular songs can still siphon attention and money away from the original. Enter any title from Weezer\u2019s \u201cTeal Album\u201d into Spotify or YouTube and the new recordings sit right next to the originals. At the same time, this side-by-side placement might encourage deeper exploration of our musical past. If you realize that your favorite song is actually a cover, you might be inclined to listen to the original. But do we need to know the original to appreciate a cover? Or even be aware that a song we know well is a cover to begin with? Listeners unfamiliar with Nine Inch Nails might believe Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cHurt\u201d is originally his. No doubt similar assumptions have been made about Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cAll Along the Watchtower,\u201d which is actually a Bob Dylan tune. Many other artists have also covered \u201cAll Along the Watchtower.\u201d If a song gets repeatedly covered, it could be a sign of its artistic strength. As professor of American literature and culture Russell Reising writes, \u201cThere\u2019s clearly something about the Dylan original that not only continues to inspire performers but resonates with the socio-political events of our culture.\u201d Even great originals can possess a degree of unrealized potential just waiting to be discovered by the artists that cover them. I can say now ,weezer became a cover band ",
