            "answer_text": "Well I guess you can classify me as American, but I do classify myself as Chinese. Not all Americans hate k-pop, there are a lot of new fans this year. Some people may dislike (hate is a strong word) k-pop because\u2026 it is in a foreign language. But Latino music is making its way into America. I think that k-pop will eventually make its way in.it is very manufactured. The way that idol groups are formed are by the entertainment companies. I guess back in the days, groups were formed by friends who wanted to make music. But shows such as the X-Factor formed One Direction and Little Mix, groups that have made it big in America and around the globe.some groups do not write their own songs. There are idols who do take part in the composition, lyrics, and arrangement of their songs. Take for example, Seventeen, formed by Pledis Entertainment. Their nickname is \u201cself-producing idols\u201d as one of the members Woozi produces all (maybe the majority of) their songs and the rest of the members take part in the lyrics and composition. All the rappers in the group write their own lines. But remember, some artists give away their songs to others, meaning that not every artist takes part in every song that is attached to their name.Here\u2019s my list of possibly why Americans hate k-pop. If I made a mistake in anything, please comment below and I will see that I fix it by a week afterwards. ",

I can say 50% of my friends are obsessed the other 50% hate it. And honestly the ones that hate it can\u2019t give me a good reason as of why they hate it. They just are those type of people who want to ruin the mood or your day. I heard a few well how can you listen to them if you don\u2019t understand. Well how can you listen to Spanish music Bilando was a banger so is Taki Taki and you sang both do you know what they are saying not even a little. I ask my mom to interpret Spanish so I know and I take Japanese I so it helps me learn more about Asia. I also do understand some things they say. The meanings of most of their songs are so good. They=Kpop singers,rappers,etc. ",
