            "answer_text": "Yes to a certain degree. If you are looking at an older vehicle (maybe a classic), then there are possibly some aftermarket manufacturers that provide kits to upgrade existing drum brake systems. These designs were fairly simple and straightforward but may still require replacement of other components, including but not limited to suspension-related parts. In the early 80\u2019s, I had a utility vehicle that had 4 wheel drum brakes, rear wheel drive only. The front had IFS and solid axle leaf spring rear suspension. This was a custom build using a shortened USMC chassis but using mainly Japanese surplus parts for suspension and engine components. The front drum was removed and swapped with a Toyota true dual piston solid disc brakes, the rear was grafted with a Nissan pick-up truck brakes. Fortunately everything lined up and nothing required modification except for the steering linkages. (Eventually, I upgraded this vehicle to a bigger brake booster with a true dual line brake reservoir (separate front and rears). Front conversion - IFS with dual 1.25\u2033 inch piston calipers with solid 12 inch discs  Rear disc brake conversion retaining original live axle components  Newer cars and vehicles post 80\u2019s may have come with disc brake options from the factory. So if your vehicle had an upper-tier model that had disc brakes but the one you have has the bottom-tier drum only brakes, then you might be able to simply swap components from a donor car of the same vintage. This procedure is easier if you have a rear wheel live axle (like a truck) where you can just even swap the entire rear differential with drums to an newer one with brakes. However, you should still check and compare if other components from the the base-drum vehicle and the disc-brake equipped vehicle are the same part numbers. For example, some would require upgraded vacuum brake boosters, a different proportioning valve, etc. Late 90\u2019s to early 2000 vehicles can also benefit from the same principle as above. I upgraded a 97 Mitsubishi Eclipse, that had rear drum brakes to disc brakes from a higher end model. The swap was simple and required only the disc brake assembly itself, the backing plate, caliper brackets and of course, new discs and pads. New parking brake cables were used (although it was also possible to reuse the drum-brake parking cable with a bit of modification. The original brake hoses and the proportioning valve number matches both the disc and non-disc vehicles so they were kept and reused. Below is the OEM rear drum assembly prior to removal  After conversion to disc (initially old hardware was reused)  After making sure that everything worked well with no braking issues, the calipers, internal parking brake shoes (which uses the \u201chat\u201d of the disc as it\u2019s \u201cdrum\u201d), rotors and pads were replaced with OEM grade components. This car was intended to be a daily driver. This was a very simple swap since this was a FWD vehicle with no ABS. As long as the vehicle does not have sensitive or crucial electronics to the wheels, then these swaps and upgrades are fairly simple and cheap. However, newer cars and vehicles with sensors and electronics (esp all wheel drive and four wheel drive) may not be a simple task. It is still possible but would require better planning and much greater expense. If direct bolt-ons are possible, then it makes the swaps easier and cheaper but in a lot of these newer-vehicle situations, some specialized and expensive fabrication may also be involved. If you are willing to do it (and you know how to do this properly), or you are willing to pay somebody to do this, then it is definitely possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers given by the experts so far pertain to conversion from drum brakes to disc brakes in the case of cars. It is not clear whether the question is regarding four wheelers or two wheelers. I would like to give below my views in relation to motorcycle applications. The conversion of a motorcycle having drum brakes to use disc brakes is an elaborate exercise, requiring changes in several parts and sub-assemblies. In the case of front brake, it is necessary to replace the brake drum, brake panel, brake cable, brake lever with its holder on the handlebar, etc. with brake disc, mating parts suitable for mounting brake disc, caliper assembly, brake hose, master cylinder (on handlebar), etc. The conversion is still more difficult in the case of rear brake. Mounting of disc brake parts on a motorcycle requires very high level of accuracy and good knowledge by the mechanic who does the conversion. It is not advisable to attempt such an exercise, since the benefit of fitting a disc brake system cannot be realized unless it is done with perfection. ",

            "answer_text": "We recently received a note from the owner of a 65 Mustang asking us to justify the cost and expense of converting his car from drum to disc brakes. We field this question on a regular basis, so we thought it made sense to share our thoughts with our readers. Most classic car owners are willing to invest large sums of money on custom paint jobs, new interiors, and re-built or upgraded engines restorations. At the same time, many of these same owners balk at investing restoration funds on new brakes. Obviously, we think this is a mistake, but even if didn't sell brakes, we would urge classic car owners to consider swapping out inefficient drum brake systems for disc brake technology. Many of the modifications made to classic cars are designed to improve the performance or appearance of the vehicle. Although some will say that upgrading brakes is a performance issue (and it is), converting from drum to disc brake technology also enhances safety. There are so many variables, including distracted drivers and wet, slippery surfaces, beyond our control. What\u2019s more, 95% of the cars we pass on the road are equipped with disc brakes. These vehicles stop much more quickly than the 65 Mustang with factory original brakes prompting this post. Put another way, the difference of just five feet in better braking performance can mean the difference between an accident and a close call where both the driver and the vehicle emerge unscathed. So, what is the true value of safety? The pictures below tell the story\u2026.    We don\u2019t know the specific chain of events that led up to this, and as you can see, this crash was not life threatening. At the same time, you have to wonder, would equipping this car with disc brakes have helped the driver avoid this accident? Maybe not, but I sure like a vehicle\u2019s chances with disc brakes over drums. Disc brakes stop quicker and more efficiently than a drum/drum system. You\u2019ll never clear the road of crazy or distracted drivers and slippery roads are a function of mother-nature, but you do have control over the type of braking system installed on your car. Knowing you have the option to upgrade the brakes on your vehicle more than justifies the cost\u2026just our two cents. Master Power Brakes carries a complete line of make/model/year disc brake conversion kits designed specifically for your car. Our drum-to-disc conversion kits are affordable, easy to install, and most importantly, they will increase the odds of keeping you, your passengers, and your car safe. If you have questions or comments, give us a call or drop us a note\u2026we would love to hear from you! ",

            "answer_text": "The question has an underlying premise, that this is something you would want to do. The most obvious reason is for improved braking ability. Production vehicle braking systems are generally well designed for the vehicles they are installed in. They match the hydraulic master with the slave cylinders, they have independent systems, they have a third system for handbrakes. If you were to change the slave systems for disks rather than drums, you would need to carefully match the fluid use. possible? yes. recommended: no. Drums and disks also have different cooling requirements. Ensure the airflow to the installed disc is sufficient for the installed disk. You would also need to ensure the disk had no less braking capacity than the drum, and if it had increased braking capacity, this didn\u2019t exceed the strength of transmission and wheel components. Practically in many modern cars, the introduction of disk brakes also led to another innovation - ABS. Locking the wheels decreases the braking performance (and steering capability) in most vehicles. So if you were designing a vehicle from the ground up would you consider improving the design to include disk brakes - why not?. If you had an older car and wanted to improve the braking ability, then answer is \u2018it's possible\u2019 but a large amount of effort, probably not delivering the goal you want. It is generally not sensible to redesign braking components on a production vehicle, and would in most places require complete recertification of the safety of the vehicle. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The modifications needed would be the proper disk and caliper set-up and ancillaries (either from a like automobile that has the disk brake option or a kit from a third party like Power Stop or Wilwood) and you may also need the proper brake proportioning valve for all disk brakes as more fluid is needed to operate disk brake versus drum on the rear circuit. There would also may be a need to accommodate for a parking brake but that would be taken care of in a swap or aftermarket kit presumably. You might try just a front conversion leaving the drums on the back. In my experience a drum to disk conversion for the rear is a bit of a waste of money particularly on front drive cars As drum brake deficiencies versus disk can be made up easily with a change of shoe material for better braking. Unless you have a race car. Track day cars may benefit from the full conversion. ",

            "answer_text": "You must be speaking of classic vehicles since all U.S. vehicles had front disk brakes by ~1973 per federal mandate. There are many front disk conversion kits. Mopars can bolt up the 1973+ front disk spindles and lower ball joints (w/ upper adapter) to say 1960\u201372 A-body cars, or even use later Aspen/Volare parts. Ford & GM may be similar. There were also 1960\u201372 front disk setups which can be swapped, though those parts are now rare. Mustangs and Darts used very similar Kelsey-Hayes calipers and rotors those years. Perhaps a better approach is a Scarebird kit, which uses common and newish Chevy or Toyota calipers & rotors with special brackets (for many models). But, you can spend >$1000 for custom kits from Wilwood, SSBC, and others, or even >$3000 for a complete custom front-end suspension, steering, and brake setup w/ new frame rails. If speaking of replacing rear drum brakes in a newish car, yes you can probably swap over parts if your model had a rear-disk option. There is little advantage since rear disks are mainly for show, which is why so many cars still use rear drums. Rears only do ~30% of the braking so don\u2019t overheat unless the shoes jam. ",

I was able to utilize the calipers and mounts, and bought new rotors, pads, and aftermarket steel braided lines, but overall it was less expensive than an aftermarket disc brake kit. ",

Now depending on how much you want to spend you can fit rear discs to just about any car regardless of age, many companies are specialists in modernising old cars and make kits but you\u2019d have to search for you make and model to learn more. It all depends on how much money you want to spend, the first options you could get the brake calipers from a wreckers or off eBay used or reconditioned, get some new discs and pads to match.
