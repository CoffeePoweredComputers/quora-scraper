They got to know that Namjoon, Jk and Tae are dating since 2017..... Saesangs also said that Dispatch was supposed to expose one of the member this October but Bighit is paying dispatch, so I don't think BTS will be exposed any time sooner..now listen, these are all the information I got, its not 100\u2105 proven but we will make ourselves look stupid if we say they don't have gf or they never dated..its not possible, like come on, they are guys in their 20's..they do have a love life..

I believe that if they end up getting Girlfriends, they will start losing fans, as well as K-Pop stans wanna see their Bias single. Plus I also believe if they got girlfriends they wouldn\u2019t get as many songs Recorded and Published, as they would be Too busy. (my Thoughts, I know that Many kpop artists who have Gotten Girlfriends/Boyfriends normally end up getting kicked out of Bands and Losing company Production!) ",
