            "answer_text": "Greetings, Stock prices move up and down every minute due to fluctuations in supply and demand. If more people want to buy a particular stock, its market price will increase. Conversely, if more people want to sell a stock, its price will fall. This relationship between supply and demand is tied into the type of news reports that are issued at any particular moment.  How News Affects Stock Prices Negative news will normally cause individuals to sell stocks. Bad earnings reports, poor corporate governance, economic and political uncertainty, as well as unexpected, unfortunate occurrences will translate to selling pressure and a decrease in stock price. Positive news will normally cause individuals to buy stocks. Good earnings reports, increased corporate governance, new products and acquisitions, as well as positive overall economic and political indicators, translate into buying pressure and an increase in stock price. For example, a hurricane making landfall may cause a drop in utility stocks. Meanwhile, depending on the severity of the storm, insurance stocks could also take a hit on the news (or even climb higher if the expected damage is projected to be moderate). The Impact of Unexpected News But it's difficult, if not impossible, to capitalize on news. The impact of new information on a stock depends on how unexpected the news is. This is because the market is always building future expectations into prices. For example, if a company comes out with better-than-expected profits, the stock's price will likely jump. But, if that same profit was expected by a majority of investors, the stock's price will likely remain the same as the profit would have already been factored into the stock price. Thus, it's unexpected news \u2013 not just any news \u2013 that helps drive prices in both directions. I hope this information helps you understand the impact the news on stock price fluctuations.

            "answer_text": "I think one of the most valuable things that an investor can learn is that investing involves risk. Risk is another word for probability. Which means, you have to stop thinking in binary outcomes! You have to think in statistical outcomes. Let me show you what I mean. There are three possible movements in a stock price over a given period of time: UpDownSidewaysIn addition to the three outcomes, you have to think about the extremity of each outcome. In other words, if the stock goes up, how much will it go up? If it goes down, how much down? And so on... This helps you understand the risk you are taking on and the statistical profitability of the trade. In other words, if I could do this trade 1,000 times, would I be profitable on the whole? Let's say we analyze XYZ investment and determine a range of possible outcomes: 70% chance XYZ returns 10%.15% chance XYZ loses 50%.15% chance XYZ gains/loses 0%.Which is the profitable trade? Going long or short? Most people say, \"I'm fairly certain that XYZ will go up, let's go long.\" But is that a statistically profitable trade?  Well, if we did this trade 1,000 times and summed the results, what would be the outcome?  UP: 700 x 0.10 = 70DOWN: 150 x -0.5 = -75SIDEWAYS: 150 x 0.0 = 0The aggregate result is a loss of 0.5% (70 - 75 = -5 / 1000 = -0.5%). Going long is a losing trade, on the whole--even though you are 70% sure the investment will return 10%! In fact, even the short trade is not very profitable. This, on the whole, is not a very good trade. The point is, thinking in a binary fashion (up/down) can get you in a lot of trouble with investing. You have to evaluate statistical outcomes because, over a lifetime of investing you will make tons of these decisions. If you are making bad statistical decisions you will erode your wealth over time. If you are making good decisions you will add to your wealth over time. It is like being in a casino: just because you win big occasionally doesn't mean you aren't losing on the whole. In the end, you have to determine which risks you are willing to accept and which you are not willing to accept. Take on those risks you are willing to take on, set you loss thresholds and welcome to investing! --Do not construe this answer as investment advice. Your situation is unique, so consult a financial, tax and legal advisor before embarking on any investment plan. No strategy can guarantee profits or protect against losses. ",
