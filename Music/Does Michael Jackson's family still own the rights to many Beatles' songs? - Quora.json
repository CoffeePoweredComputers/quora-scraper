            "answer_text": "Dear questioner Michael Jackson\u2019s family NEVER owned the ATV catalogue. His family had nothing to do with it as they were ALL excluded from his will. Michael Jackson in fact owned the ATV catalogue, including the Beatles\u2019 and other songs . He bought it for 47.5 million dollars in August 1985 from Australian millionaire Holmes a Court on the condition he would appear at the telethon in Perth for handicapped kids , which he did. He sold 50% of the catalogue to Sony in 1995 for 110 million dollars and he used the other half as collateral for the loans he took from Bank of America in 1998 and in 1999 ( 270 million $) , which by 2005 were sold to Fortress, which charged him with double digit interest rates , thus he made ridiculous payments of 4.5 million $ MONTHLY on loan interests , hence his gigantic debt . Michael Jackson excluded his siblings and his father from his will , he left 40% of his Estate to his mother Katherine , who ONLY has a lifelong income, which will be evenly shared among his kids in the event of Katherine\u2019s death, and has ABSOLUTELY NO SAY in how the Estate is run , and 40% to his 3 children Prince , Paris and Blanket. The remaining 20% of the Estate , which is now 1 billion $, is for Michael Jackson\u2019s favourite charities. He also provided for 3 of cousins and Tito\u2019s 3 sons. The Estate is run by John Branca and John MacClain , who sold the catalogue ( including the Beatles\u2019 songs) to Sony in 2016 for 750 million $ FOR NO REASON AT ALL as by then the Estate was more than solvent , in fact , the Estate was rolling in it. Michael\u2019s alleged 400 million dollars debt was paid off within a few years since his death due to the This is it movie ( it grossed 325 million $), posthumous album sales , Cirque du Soleil Immortal and MJ ONE tours ( they grossed more than 500 million dollars) , i tunes etc. The executors of the will , John Branca and John MacClain , said they would hold onto the catalogue for his children as it was a major cornerstone for the Estate. Then they sold it in 2016 as they said again for his children. Note that MJ fired both John Branca and John MacClain on 3 February 2003 and his will was allegedly signed on 7 July 2002 in Los Angeles BUT according to eye witnesses Michael Jackson was in New York then protesting against SONY and announced he would leave Sony then. John Branca has yet to explain why and how Michael \u2018s will was in his possession who was \u2018\u2019employed\u2019\u2019 by MJ again on 17/06/2009, a week before he died , and to whom Michael hardly spoke more than twice since 2006 , when Branca opposed to a 300 million $ loan MJ tried to secure in 2006 to avoid involuntary bankruptcy , based on 5% of the catalogue MJ gave Branca in 1993, when he rehired him. Michael Jackson fired Frank Dileo and John Branca in 1989 and in 1990 respectively urged by David Geffen, the movie and music mogul he admired and foolishly listened to. He rehired Branca in 1993 and he fired him again in 2003, mainly because he legally represented Sony, with which MJ had a conflict of interest , behind his back. Michael\u2019s Estate no longer owns the Beatles\u2019 songs. They were sold to Sony by the Estate\u2019s executors John Branca and John MacClain in 2016 for 750 million dollars. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they don't. In 1995, Michael Jackson agreed to a deal with Sony that he and Sony would co-own the Sony/ATV catalogue (that consisted of Lennon-McCartney songs) and whichever party is financially able and willing to do so, will buy out the stake of the other after a period of expiration. In 2016, the contract period expired, and MJJ Estate wasn't in a financial position to buy out Sony's stake, so it sold its own stake to Sony, resulting in Sony owning the full catalogue. The sale was done for around $750 mil, which was later criticized for being undervalued. As it stands now, Sony fully owns the Sony/ATV catalogue. ",
