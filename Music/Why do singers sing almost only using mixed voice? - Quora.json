            "answer_text": "Your question is too vague. Do you mean ALL singers, as in: those you hear on top 40 radio, folk singers, opera singers, acid rock shriekers, Tuvan throat singers, Jewish Cantors, opera singers, musical theater singers, Zarzuela singers, county western singers, Bulgarian Women singers, Chinese Opera singers, Bollyood stars, Fado singers, Mexican Ranchera singers, native American singing, etc? The point I\u2019m trying to make here is that there are so many varies styles of singing and ways humanity has found to use the voice as a mode of musical expression. It runs the gamut. I can think of a few genres of music where \u201chead\u201d voice is primarily used: mothers singing lullabies; Brazilian Bossa Nova; legions of Indie singers who sound like cloying kittens. There are certainly many other genres but these three popped into my head first. ",
