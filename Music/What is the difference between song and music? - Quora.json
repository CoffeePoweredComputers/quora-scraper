            "answer_text": "Hi, my understanding of this question is highlighting the difference. In my experience, knowledge and theory of the subject a song is a piece of music. This where someone or a group of people use their voice to sing words. Words are written to have some form of meaning or not. These words become the lyrics of a song. And the song can either done with voice alone or accompanied with instruments that provide notable beat and melody. One person or a group of people team together to produce a song you not like or enjoy. On the other hand music in my theory is a piece is created with instruments and devices. These pieces are made up of one kind or various kinds of instruments. A piece of music is written with a beat, low, medium and high notes. These notes also tell the performer how short or long each note is. People can produce music on their own, in pairs, quartets, bands and orchestra. Everyone play their instrument and team up to produce something for people to not like or enjoy. That's my point of view\u2026 xx wendy ",
