            "answer_text": "I know that this is indeed a very sensitive topic \u2013 nevertheless I feel that I must write about it no real facts are put forward, only subjective opinions are given. If, however, facts had been given to support the opinion I would have accepted it, but instead it prompts me to add some quality and objective arguments to this debate by writing this article. Muhammad Rafi is the best male playback singer that India has ever produced. If you disagree with this then please read my article posted on this website: TheImpact of Md. Rafi death on India's music industry. And if you are still not convinced then you are entitled to your personal opinion, however unreasonable it may be. The current article would then probably be a waste of your time, thus you should stop reading any further and continue the blind belief that Kumar Sanu or Kishore Kumar is the embodiment of perfect singing. On the female side Lata Mangeshkar is considered the best Indian playback singer, but the question that begs to be answered is: Who is the best; Muhammad Rafi or Lata Mangeshkar? A question that many people at one point have thought about, and some may have answered it while others didn\u2019t. And yes, it is a very controversial question and many people would probably advise me not to write about it. Some would argue that the comparison cannot be made due to the pair being a male and a female. I disagree on both accounts and to prove my position I need to apply some rationality and reason. So, first some boring trivia. Rafi the greatest male singer with the most beautiful voice; his personality were equally great and beautiful \u2013 indeed a great role model for any human being. This obviously begs the question: Is it important that a good singer needs to be a good human being as well? Of course not! But if you sing songs about love, compassion, empathy etc. then people expects the same emotions/feelings to some extend in your personality. If your personality then turns out to show significant negative traits, people get confused. They are not able to identify the positive traits of the voice with the negative traits of the person and thus a conflicting love/hate relationship starts developing. This is in essence the relationship I have with Lata; I unconditionally love her voice and songs, but I\u2019m disgusted by her behavior. For me my idol is MD.Rafi Sahab.. Mohammed Rafi Number of songs? It is acknowledged that he has sung a total of 26,000 songs, but res... Read more at: 35 things you should know about Mohammed Rafi It's a well-known fact that Lata and Rafi parted ways over royalty in the sixties. All the insecure male-female singers, barring Rafi, wanted to get a cut from the producer, director etc. Lata was too vocal on this count. She saw penury. So did Rafi. Rafi also lived in a chawl (shanty) till 1956 when 'Aan' catapulted him to stardom. Despite Lata's indubitable greatness, there's no gainsaying the fact that she has always been very scheming, manipulative and morbidly vindictive. There were two female singers, who challenged her hegemony: Her sister Asha and Suman Kalyanpur. Following the tiff with Lata, Rafi continued getting offers for duets with Asha and Suman. And they sang some of the immortal duets like 'Thahariye, hosh mein aa loon' (Rafi-Suman, composer-Khayyam) and 'Bahut haseen hain tumhari ankhein\u2019 (Rafi-Suman, S. Mohinder). This made Lata insecure and she wanted to patch up with the great Rafi. She approached Jaikishan and the matter was sorted out. But Rafi never apologised. He was a man of principles unlike Lata. She harboured a lifelong grudge against Rafi and when Rafi had a lull period in the late sixties and early seventies, thanks to Kishore's meteoric rise, Lata even gave an interview to the now defunct 'Madhuri' (a Hindi film magazine) that Kishore was much greater than Rafi which embarrassed Kishore and Rajesh Khanna, for whom Rafi had lent his voice in Chetan Anand's 'Akhari Khat' (1966) and 'Raaz' (1966). Rajesh Khanna always accepted the fact that it was Rafi's immortal 'Aur kuchh der thahar aur kuchh der na ja' (Akhari Khat) that got him the footing in the industry. ",

She would have been one of the classical legends had she chosen to go down the path of classical music, alas, she had a family to feed. The world got a playback singing legend instead.   ",
