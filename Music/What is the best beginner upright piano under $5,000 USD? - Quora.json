            "answer_text": "Is the beginner a child or an adult? If it is a child and you are concerned with wear and tear here is my answer (which may be unpopular with other professionals but I stand by it nonetheless): get a free piano. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have had friends and students give in and pay a lot of money for a used or even new low quality piano when an amazing used upright in mint condition goes up for free shortly thereafter. I have tested this theory time and time again. People tend to move and not bring along their pianos which to me sounds like not bringing your baby along however you will benefit if someone nearby does this when you need a good upright! Check buy/sell/trade sites daily. Have an idea of the brands you want and the cost to move them so you will be able to move quickly if a good piano comes up. Befriend a good tuner. Find out if they can inspect a used piano with you to make sure it is in tuneable condition. Some extremely old pianos cannot be tuned because the strings will not stay tuned or are weak. They may charge a fee in which case I would only hire them to inspect the piano if you are in love with it. The tuner can also determine if all three pedals work because when they do not it is very annoying as you progress to playing more challenging songs. If the student is adult & not concerned with wear & tear you can get a used Kawai which is one of my favorite brands. One of my students just paid $500 for a mint condition Kawai. I don\u2019t recommend a used piano unless there is proof it has been tuned and maintained. Some good used pianos are ones parents maintained for their school aged children and want to regift when their kids move out, etc. This question does not specify used or new piano. For beginners I think it\u2019s really better to find a decent used piano. Try it out first because if it doesn\u2019t feel nice to you it will be harder to convince yourself to practice. There are a lot of brands of pianos that feel like toy pianos to me but I have friends who love to play them more than the expensive brands! Sometimes it truly does come down to personal taste. That said, there are definitely some interesting newer and cheaper pianos coming out by brands such as Perzina which have a bright sound. It is just tough to say if they will stand the test of time as the older brands have done. One last thing: you can learn a lot by respectfully asking the owners of a local piano store if you can play several pianos to get a feel for the sound you like. You will be amazed at how different they all are, and it will give you a head start on listening attentively to what you are practicing! ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of great pianos out there both used and new for under $5,000. For new, look at Kawai and Yamaha. Those will come with warranties of at least 10 years. There are also lots of great used pianos. Be careful of people giving away pianos. Sometimes these are the old upright pianos of the late 1800s or early 1900s that would require a significant investment to get them in shape. However, take a look at all pianos you are interested in. Once you find a couple you like, especially if used, you might want to have a technician look at them. ",
