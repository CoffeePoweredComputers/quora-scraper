            "answer_text": "What capacitor is used to make a full-range speaker sound like a surrounding speaker? There is no capacitor yet conceived that can make a speaker sound like a surround speaker. That\u2019s like asking what denomination coin makes me sound like an opera singer. There is no connection between the two. Still, I might guess what you are asking. Surround speakers are generally smaller speakers. They are small because they don\u2019t need to reproduce very low frequencies that would take extra size, volume, and dollars to make. People can\u2019t detect the location of low frequency sounds - it may seem like you can, but you are really locating the source of the sound from its higher harmonics. You would literally need elephant ears to locate bass frequencies. If you remove the higher harmonics and any distortion from the low frequency sound, you can\u2019t find the source of the sound. That is why a surround sound system only needs a single bass woofer. The surround speakers are used to create the illusion of the sound coming from a particular location. As said, these are high frequencies so the surround speakers as well as the left-right main speakers do not have to use large bass drivers, saving cost, size, and weight. So what I am getting at is that I guess that what you call \u201csounding like a surround speaker\u201d is actually the sound of a driver with all the low frequencies removed, because that is what a surround speaker by itself sounds like. It might sound like a surround speaker by itself, but it won\u2019t work like a surround speaker. The effect of the surround speaker is not from the speaker itself, it comes from the signal that is supplied to the speaker. For that you need a separate amplifier driving a unique signal for those particular surround sounds. Typically a home system has a surround sound processor that decodes a complex surround sound signal so that it can send different signals to each of the surround speakers. Without a decoder to extract the unique \u201cleft rear\u201d, or \u201cright rear\u201d signal, you will not be able to hear the surround effect, you will just hear the same signal coming from another speaker \u201cover there\u201d. Now let me try to work in the capacitor you mention. A capacitor is a device that will pass AC audio signals, but depending on the size of the capacitor (and other factors) the signal it passes can only go so low in frequency. A capacitor with a larger value of capacitance will allow lower frequency signals to pass through it. For example, a 1uF capacitor will not pass nearly as much low frequency signal as a 100uF capacitor. If you connect a speaker up to an amplifier thru one of those two capacitors, the 100uF will allow more bass frequencies to be heard. The math is more complex then simply equating a capacitor value with a frequency range. It depends on how much current is flowing, which depends on the amplifier and speakers themselves - how much AC resistance the speaker has. For a typical 8 ohm impedance speaker, using a capacitor of 470uF will reduce a 42Hz signal (roughly the lowest bass note) by about 6 dB, or half as loud. If we change the speaker to a 4 ohm speaker, all other things being equal, the low point where the sound is about 6 dB less moves up to 84 Hz or one octave, so a lower impedance speaker would need a larger capacitor - about twice as large in value. So if we assume that a \u201csurround speaker-like\u201d sound is made so that the low frequencies start dropping off where the 6 dB down point is at 500 Hz (which would be more in the middle of a piano keyboard range), a 40 uF capacitor would roughly make that sound for you. But not just any 40 uF capacitor will do. The capacitor needs to be non-polarized (it withstands currents and voltages in either direction), and must be designed to withstand the highest peak voltage that the amplifier can deliver combined with any back-emf generated by a moving speaker coil. It must also be rated to handle the AC current through it, so as to not overheat and destroy itself. That\u2019s not usually a big problem with a small low power system, but a larger sound system with more power makes this choice more important. I mean you can wreck a paper airplane without a lot of mayhem and destruction, but wreck a 747 jet aircraft and the carnage would be much more significant. In an actual surround system processor with separate outputs, each output will often have its own amplifier built-in to it so you can connect it directly to the speaker. In all likelihood, this processor/amplifier will be designed to filter out any lower frequencies, and a specific capacitor in the surround speaker is not needed. It would only be there for protection if used in another system setup. More often the designers choose to reduce the ability of the amplifier to handle lower frequencies because they can be made cheaper by using smaller capacitor values, so an external capacitor on the surround speakers would be useless. In my earlier example I chose 500Hz as just a guess. A surround system will have its own crossover frequency inherent in the design, and that could be higher or lower depending on the speakers the systems was designed to use. It would also likely use an active filter system or digital filter system, that can make a much more precise and controlled filter response than a capacitor can do by itself. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by a full range speaker.  The above is what we usually consider a full range speaker driver.  This one is a field coil that is why it has a separate power supply and it is considered a full range because it responds from 20 to 20,000 Hz. If you are talking about something like this  It can be considered a full range because it responds to the most audible frequencies. But it does not have only one loudspeaker driver. It has a few.  And the idea you get of a certain \u201csurroundness\u201d is not achieved with a capacitor. It is achieved with the positioning of the drivers and with a digital sound processor. What you do with a single capacitor  is to create the cheapest and simplest crossover possible. You put it in series with the tweeter and you have a two way speaker. The bottom driver responds to all possible frequencies within its range and the tweeter responds from a certain frequency upwards until its limit range. You have to be more specific with your question if you want a different answer. ",
