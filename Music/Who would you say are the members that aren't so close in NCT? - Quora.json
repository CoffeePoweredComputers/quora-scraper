            "answer_text": "I would have to say Xiaojun, Hendery, and Yangyang have to be the most distant from the other NCT members. This would only be because they were the most recent members added to the group, and since they are in WayV, their promotions mainly take place in China so they don\u2019t meet with the other members often. NCT sub-units are also separated by dorms, so they wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with other NCT members (besides WayV). The NCT Dream members have mentioned before that they aren\u2019t very close but do occasionally see each other in the practice rooms. They also started their training period later than the other members, so when the other members debuted, they just started their training. Otherwise, the other NCT members are pretty close with each other, considering they spend their trainee days, dorm life, and current promotions together. ",

When dream reacts to 127, jaemin is rather quiet about taeyong and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever spoken about him and vice versa. I don\u2019t think they hate each other, but I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re that close. ",
