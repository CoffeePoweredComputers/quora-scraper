            "answer_text": "I Know by Jungkook and RMThis is a song released during the Festa 2015 (its their 3rd year). It was a subunit of JK x RM. The first ever fan song, but it wasn\u2019t officially released. But the one that makes the entire fandom melt is because of two things : The lyric goes \u2018Thank you for being by our side for the last three years\u2019The lyrics actually adressing fanboys, who usually overlooked. The lyric specifically goes \u201cKnow you love me girl, so that I love you. Know you love me boy, so that I love you.\u201dMiss RightThis has never been a fansong. However, it was usually sang at the end of their HYYH concert, and it somehow felt like a fan song. Because it\u2019s the song they sing with the fans, and kinda felt like they are singing the song for the fans. 2!3!First ever official fan song! A total emotional breakdown song. The heartbreaking lyrics : \u201cI wanna say that things will get better after this, but I can\u2019t say that. I wanna say we\u2019ll only walk on flower path after this, but I couldn\u2019t lie like that\u201d\u201cBecause you guys are idols, even if I didn\u2019t hear/listen, I know it (your music) sucks\u201d\u201c(People say) Because you have no power/influence, you must have done dirty things for success\u201d - reference to sajaegi and plagiarism scandals.\u201cThanks for believing in someone like me, dealing with all these tears and wounds\u201d\u201c(People say) Looking at how you guys are doing, you guys are going to fail.\u201dPied PiperA diss song to Armys. To get to work and get their job done. The lyrics : \u201cLet's stop watching and and start studying for the exams\u201d\u201cYour parents and boss hate me\u201dThe video clips you watched, various pictures and tweets. Gotta watch V app. I know that you like it, what do you do. Stop it, you can analyze the movie later.\u201d\u201ca year or two flashes by. This song is a reward I give you\u201dMagic ShopHappy yet emotional song. The lyrics specifically mentioned an old Joon\u2019s tweet back in 2015. Once, in 2015, amidst all the scandals, Joon tweeted \u201cOne day, me and my people would win. We will move forward, naturally. No one will see us coming.\u201d And the lyrics of Magic Shop goes : \u201cWhat did I told you? I told you we would win\u201d :\u2019( Magic Shop isn\u2019t about a song comforting Armys saying \u201ceverything will be okay\u201d, as people easily said. It\u2019s about how things WILL get tough in some days, but instead of saying \u201cit will be okay\u201d, they\u2019ll their stories too, so that the fans knew that they\u2019re not alone. -refers to Jungkook\u2019s line- It also talk about how BTS humbly said that the reason of their success is not because of them, they did nothing, but it\u2019s us who find them. The lyrics : We made it. (No) I was just here, but you came to me \u2014 At the end of my despair Do not forget I finally found you You were standing at the edge of the cliff My last reason to live \u2014 It also talked about how if we manage to find/acknowledge the supposedly ordinary bts who has nothing special, than we can do anything. If we can help bts have their lives change and be successful, we can give our best for ourselves too. The lyrics : You gave me the best of me So you'll give the best of you You found me. You knew me You gave me the best of me So you'll give the best of you HomeBasically talked about how no matter how BTS have already own everything, they sometimes feel lonely too. And the fans are their home. It reflects from the lyrics With you, Imma feel rich You know I want that home, You know you got that home  So yeah, that\u2019s all of their fansongs! ",

            "answer_text": "I know - The song is not on Spotify, iTunes etc. or on any album. Only RM and Jungkook sing it. They wrote it for their anniversary party in 2015. 2!3! - It\u2019s the first official song for ARMYs. It\u2019s on the WINGS Album. Pied Piper - It\u2019s the second official song. It\u2019s on the Love Yourself Her Album. They\u2019re kinda dissing us in the song xD Magic Shop - It\u2019s the third official song. It\u2019s on the Love Yourself Tear Album. Jungkookie produced and wrote it (so proud of my baby), he really did a good job :) HOME - It\u2019s the fourth official song. It\u2019s on their newest album Map of the Soul: Persona. But you could say that the whole album is for ARMYs. They said themselves that the whole album is about them and ARMYs. Hope I could help you a bit. I thought about telling you what the songs are about but tbh.. I\u2019m the laziest person in the universe xD I wish you a good day and I purple you <3 Bye~ ",
