            "answer_text": "You're not supposed to like something just because you would like to. Although some musical genres such as free jazz, contemporary music, atonal music or electro-accoustic music are culturally harder to get into, it's your sub-conscious musical taste that should have the last say, always. As an example, some contemporary pieces rank amongst my favorite works of music ever, but these are an exception, as most of the time I simply don't enjoy it that much. As with most genres of erudit music, you really need to practice an active listening in order make something out of the piece. Just having it in background while playing cards with your friends won't probably make it meaningful to you. Either way, and as stated before, there is a little bit of getting used to it or, as I prefer, getting to know what you should be listening to.Historically, atonal music was the obvious evolution from the saturated world of tonal music. This means that composers desired the musicality of atonal music as an opposistion to tonal music.A lot of listeners also identify with this. The fact that we are constantly being surprised with such atypical musicality. It can be a metaphor for the world we live in, or simply a way to achieve a higher emotional state. Jazz is not atonal music per se but it can teach you alot about musical discourse. Every composer uses its compositions as a discourse the same way a jazz musician discourses during his solo. It should follow some kind of line of thought which is very personal and codified in musical language and aimed only at the most attentive of the listeners. Other things to look out for are: - the tension in atonal music is for me one of the most intense parts of it. - atonal music is rich in timbric nuances and extended techniques. Watch out for that to get some new sounds. - it's also a playground for  not-so-common composition and orchestration techniques. ",
