            "answer_text": "As for Bob, he gets an 8.5 in my book. I\u2019m not a huge fan, but I recognize he was super creative and innovating. One of a kind. But he lacks the diversity and stylistic range of other songwriters I consider to be better (Lennon, Garcia, Elliott Smith). I think there is something to be said about being the first person to do somehthing a certain way, and being the best at it. He was groundbreaking, and set the stage, but I personally feel more talented songwriters were out there, but didn\u2019t have the timing and placement Dylan had. Credit for being the first to break the mold, that takes great vision, but purely in terms of songwriters, he had his shortcomings for sure, as all do. There is no perfect songwriter obviously. Though Elliott Smith came pretty damn close I thought. People often conflate innovation with being the best. There is crossoever, but there are plenty of examples of things people came up with, and weren\u2019t experts at it, and were quickly succeeded. Obviously Dylan was great on top of his innovative lyrics and creativity, but if a more well rounded musician were put in his place, with HIS innovation and creativity, you\u2019d get like a Lennon or whoever,. And that\u2019s my two cents. As far as influence, and popular opinion, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d average a 9.9/10 ",

            "answer_text": "Dylan is one of the best song writers in American history - arguably, the best. He wrote well over 150 songs - several of them reaching the top ratings -of R&B as well as country-folk charts. Most people consider his 3 greatest songs as \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d, \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me Babe\u201d and \u201cKnocking On Heaven\u2019s Door\u201d. I personally feel, however, that his greatest song writing accomplishments were the multiple songs in his Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid album (which also included \u201cKnocking On Heaven\u2019s Door\u201d). Remember the sings - Billie 1, Billie 4, Billie 7, etc - I never get tired of listening to these haunting ballads - tremendous acoustic guitar work to a Mex-Tex \u201cNortenio\u201d harmony structure. The movie is a cult classic and the soundtrack is my favorite CD. If you are not familiar with this movie and the associated sound track, I highly - highly recommend it!! ",
