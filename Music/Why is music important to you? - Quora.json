            "answer_text": "Lyrics are extremely important to me. As we are all human beings with souls, consciences, spirits & minds. No matter race,religion,age etc we ALL have pretty much the same issues in life. We all have that 1 creepy family member, we all fight amongst ourselves etc. basically what I\u2019m trying to say is everyone has the same life problems, the only thing that makes anything different is we all have different names. So therefore when songwriters write lyrics and the rest of the band comes together with the music and produces a hit we can all identify with the song. True songwriters write about life, their lives which are really no different than ours. Yes they may have a whole lot more money than we (common folk) have and way bigger homes, but the problems, family issues, sad and happy times are the same. A celebrity is NO DIFFERENT THAN US COMMON FOLK. They put their pants on same way as we do. 1 leg at a time. They were just given the talent to put life\u2019s struggles and successes into songs we can all identify with. Music has been and still is extremely influential in my life. I listen to all genres of music but Metal is my favorite. I am 46 now and I grew up a very angry and rebellious teen and Metal was my outlet. I usually listen to it when I drive and just for the hell of it. However I also listen to 80\u2019s New wave, 80\u2019s & 90\u2019s Freestyle. Some (very little) Rap. I use the Freestyle when I\u2019m feeling depressed or just off my game and it picks me up. I listen to metal because that\u2019s just my favorite genre. For me songs are very important because when I hear them it puts me in what I call \u201cThe Way Back Machine\u201d and I\u2019m immediately transported back to the year that particular song was released,& I re-live my youth. That goes for all the genres. From My favorite band MOTLEY CRUE & thrash metal like Overkill Anthrax and Metallica. To Judy Torres Coro, Corina, Stevie B etc\u2026\u2026 Then you will also find on My iPod UTFO (Roxanne Roxanne) Roxanne Shante, Whodini, Doug E Fresh Slick Rick LLCool J Run DMC, and so many more. Each song I\u2019ve ever heard in my life from Classic Rock to Today\u2019s Rap has a memory attached to it and I treasure them. The good the bad and the ugly. I apologize for this being so long and maybe sounding confusing but I am so passionate about music. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question has received a lot of great answers that reveal the passion that humans have for musical and rhythmic expression. I would add two more ideas about the importance of music to me as an amateur pianist. Music adds another dimension to my life experience. There is no other activity that takes me into a completely different perceptual space like playing music does.I am 83 years old. I can\u2019t run very fast anymore. My eyesight is not perfect anymore. I am not a strong as I used to be. In a lot of ways, old age begins imposing limits on what we can do and in the ways we can improve. But thankfully, my brain still seems to be OK, and I am not terribly crippled by arthritis. I have a wonderful grand piano, and it provides a path into that other dimension where I still can continue improving. I know I\u2019ll never be a concert pianist or a jazz phenomenon, but I play pretty well, and it is an activity where the potential for growth is so vast that it will never become a limit. I can awake every day with new goals to seek.",
