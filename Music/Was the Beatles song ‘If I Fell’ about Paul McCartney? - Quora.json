            "answer_text": "Of course you are aware certain answers to your question would cause a malestrom of angry comments. That having been said, I don't propose to know if the song If I Fell was written about Paul McCartney, it could have been been I suppose. Cynthia remarked at least once she had never seen John look at anyone the way he did Paul and wished he had looked at her that way once. I am sorry I don't have any links for you as I read it years ago. Yoko believed that Paul was her biggest rival and that John was in love with him but Paul was immoveablely heterosexual. So I suppose it could have been but so what if it was? Would that change the quality of the music? Would it make either man less of a genius than you believe them to be? It shouldn't. I have no idea who John Lennon was thinking about when he penned that particular song. Now I am going to state something that I have once or twice before. There is far more circumstancial evidence pointing to the likelihood John and Paul may have been involved at some point than there is for the whole Paul is Dead nonsense. And if they were involved and if the song was for Paul it ought not to matter in the bigger scheme of what those two best friends brought to the musical table and to us mortals. Whether it was or wasn't doesn't really matter it's about the music. So in ending I suppose it may have been but then again it may not have been. One thing is certain only two, possibly four, people know for a certainty. The dead aren't talking and fifty years in neither are the living. Correct that both George and Ringo were asked about it at different times, because of course they were, and both said they aren't their secrets or story to tell. So we may never know and at the end of the day it doesn't f**king matter does it?. Appreciate them for what they gave to us not for what they may or may not have done in private, it isn't really our business. Just enjoy the bloody song, yeah?    ",

            "answer_text": "It was written by Lennon (the intro to it was contributed by Paul) in Jan-Feb 1964, but it wasn\u2019t about Paul \u2026 or about Cynthia, or anyone else really. Basically, it was decided a love song was needed \u2014 \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d was on the horizon and all. It was this 1964 period where Lennon - as well as Paul of course - was contributing \u2018love ballads\u2019 because that\u2019s what pop star/bands did in those days. Paul has suggested the song was similar to what the singing group \u201cThe Fourmost\u201d were successfully releasing in England at the time. According to John, and Paul, there\u2019s no deeper meaning to it than that. John called it his period of cranking out \u201csilly love songs,\u201d tho since he was a great songwriter (as is Paul), they were catchy tunes. And, John has said, it did lead him to write a much better love song - his best - \u201cIn My Life.\u201d BTW, it\u2019s the ony ballad The Lads were performing live at that time, because with all the screaming of we-kids in the audience, the softer songs could barely be heard what-so-ever. So they\u2019d play it somewhat fast (significantly faster than the recording), sometimes laughing. And John once introduced it as, \u201cIf I Fell Over.\u201d  ",
