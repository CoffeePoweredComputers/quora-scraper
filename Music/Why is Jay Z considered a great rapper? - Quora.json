            "answer_text": "For a number of reasons. His lyrical ability. As a Jay-Z fan, I can objectively say that he doesn\u2019t have the craziest punchlines, most complex rhyme schemes, or most elaborate story-telling. But he knows how to incorporate enough technical skill to be critically acclaimed by hip-hop heads while at the same time being easily digestible for casual fans. He has a perfect balance that satisfies all rap fans across the board.His voice and flow. Jay-Z undoubtedly has one of the best rap voices if not the very best. His voice is easily distinguishable and cuts through the mix perfectly. He also has a laid back flow which makes it sound effortless. He purposefully rhymes slightly behind the downbeat which gives his songs a little extra bounce and grittiness.His persona. Jay-Z just has a \u201ccoolness\u201d factor about him. His character in his music is the boss/king pin. He has the most money, flyest cars, baddest chicks, and starts the most trends. Besides his big lips, there isn\u2019t really much that you can really make fun of him about. He\u2019s like the cool kid in high school that pretty much runs the place. Nas was the only rapper that was able to make fun of him successfully in his \u201cEther\u201ddiss track but Nas is an absolute lyrical genius!His overall message and mission. His lyrics are all about empowerment. He preaches ownership, independence, knowing your worth, and not bowing down to anyone no matter how powerful they are. He doesn\u2019t follow the current trends but rather sets them.His catalogue. Every project he\u2019s put out does numbers and makes a major impact on the culture. In my opinion, he has 3\u20134 classic albums. His first album, Reasonable Doubt is a cult classic for Jay-Z fans. Then Hard Knock Life Vol. 2, The Blueprint, and The Black Album are undeniable classics in hip-hop and music altogether. Having multiple classic albums along with a slew of classic singles and collaborations make his catalogue very difficult to compete with.His consistency and longevity. Jay-Z has always managed to be in the hip-hop conversation from 1996 to the present day which spans over 20 years. Most rappers have a short life line that lasts 10 years at best. Jay-Z has been able to compete with his contemporaries throughout multiple decades and eras of rap. He was a great contender in the Golden Era (mid-late 90\u2019s), he pretty much defined the early 00\u2019s, and he is still respected and revered in the present day. He has still made critically acclaimed albums and thought-provoking verses in recent times even though he is far past his prime (\u201898-\u201803).These are 6 reasons why I believe Jay-Z is one of the greatest if not the greatest rapper of all time. Not to mention, all of his business ventures and strides in social activism that has amassed him a great amount of wealth, prominence, and influence. ",

            "answer_text": "Jay-z is a master of double meaning and a genius when it comes to getting his ideas across. So much so that he can say one sentence, have it mean two things and communicate to completely different ideas that push the verse forward. What makes it better is that he uses this technique to speak on current or real live experiences. A lot of rappers are good with double meaning, but few of them are good at making the double meanings count for more than a clever play on words. While you\u2019d think this takes a lot of premeditation. Everyone that records with Jay says the same thing. He puts his verses together extremely quickly, and without writing. He\u2019s able to construct complicated, relevant and potent verses - completely off the top of his head. One can argue who\u2019s better between Jay and Eminem, and both will have good points. I usually use this point when making an argument for Jay. While Em can produce complex rhyme schemes, he usually does this at the expense of meaningfulness. When Em wants to communicate a real idea, the complexity decreases. Jay can maintain complexity to communicate his ideas. His punchlines, unlike Em\u2019s express real ideas and happenings in his life, where as Em\u2019s are showcases his rapping ability, shock the listener to get a reaction. As someone who has rapped before, it\u2019s harder to do what Jay does than what Em does. This is really a legacy of Em being a battle rapper more than anything else (though to be fair, so was Jay). Jay also stands out because while there are others in his league lyrically (Nas, Eminem, Kendrick, Andre 3000, etc), he\u2019s uses the least amount of effort to perform on that level. This gives him the advantage of being able to complete an album in a week when it takes Nas and Eminem a year. Impressively, Jay\u2019s album would be no less lyrically impressive regardless of the time spent. ",
