            "answer_text": "Your body is telling you something. Warning you. You\u2019re going to damage your vocal chords if you keep doing this without getting professional help. You can really damage yourself for future possibilities of singing if you don\u2019t stop. And get some professional help. Hire a coach because no one here can teach you the way a face to face, or using some camera internet tool for singing coach to teach you. If you persist than you will damage your vocal chords and it may take a long time to heal and you may have future after effects because of this. Please stop doing anymore and start hiring a singing coach. The coach will answer your question and will help you through basics, help you to know how to warm up, reveal techniques and this needs one to one coaching visually not by words or reading some blog or website. If you are serious about singing, stop what you are doing and get some help from a professional. ",

I also suggest you lay some books (light) upon your diaphragm area and concentrate on using those muscles. You are trying to sing too hard and probably with no support. ",
