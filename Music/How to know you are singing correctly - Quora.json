            "answer_text": "If anything starts to hurt while you are singing, you are definitely not singing correctly! For example, some people will force their voice to try to be louder or to try to reach higher notes. Don't do that a relaxed face will allow more sound through resonance, and support from the diaphragm, which will also enable your higher notes to float out effortlessly. A singing will watch and listen, and will give you excellent advice relevant to your own voice. Many singing teachers will give an introductory lesson for free. It would be perfectly valid to have trial lessons with several teachers, and only then to decide which one to start regular lessons with if you want to do so (and can afford to pay). You may be pkeasantly surprised at how much those lovely teachers may help your \u201csinging confidence\u201d in those few introductory lessons. ",
