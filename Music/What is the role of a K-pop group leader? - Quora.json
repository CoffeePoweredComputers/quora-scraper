            "answer_text": "As I\u2019ve noticed through the short time that I\u2019ve been a K-pop fan, a group leader usually: Speaks at interviews.Helps the group through tough times (the other members help too).At music shows backstage, the artists have to bow to seniors and juniors and exchange CDs with the other artists. This is usually the leader\u2019s job.Motivates the group.Is mature and charismatic.Since groups usually live in the same dorm rooms, they need a group mediator to control all conflict.Makes decisions.Of course, some groups don\u2019t have leaders because they don\u2019t need them. A good example is Blackpink. Blackpink doesn\u2019t have a leader because 1. They make decisions together and 2. At some point they all speak at interviews (Jisoo speaks at the Korean interviews, Rose and Jennie speak at the English ones, Lisa will probably speak at the Thai ones). <3 ",
