At the bottom of the screen, look for \u201cYour Library\u201d option. Hit this option. 2. Choose or tap one playlist to be able to see how many follows that one.  3. followers will be shown in the screen  4. you just need to hit the \u201cFollowers\u201d button. Now, the list of users who are following your playlist will be shown. If you wish to know more about the user, then you can tap the username to visit his or her profile in Spotify. ",

Spoitfy doesn\u2019t allow you to see who is actually following you but they do allow you to see the number. Maybe with more community feedback this might change. For now the feature isn\u2019t available. ",
