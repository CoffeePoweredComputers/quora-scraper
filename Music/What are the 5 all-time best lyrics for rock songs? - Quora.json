            "answer_text": "For me the best 5 songs when it comes to lyrics are    It's Probably Me lyrics by Sting or Eric Clapton and that song is used as original sound track for Leathal weapon 3Coming back to Life: I like this lyrics a lot and at times when I feel very depressed I listen to this song and feel betterI want to break free/ Bohemian Rhapsody: I like the lyrics of I want to break free by Queen. I like Bohemian Rhapsody lyrics as well and I am actually confused which I like the mostCats in the Cradle: This lyrics I have a very good meaning about the relation of a parent and son and I really love to listen to itSultans of Swing: Dire Straits Sultans of Swing is awesome lyrics and just portrays how a band is struggling to make an impactI like a few more like Metallica \" One\", Bon Jovi \"Always\", Lionell Richie \"Hello\" , Guns N Roses \"Paradise City\"  and a few more. But the top 5 are probably those",
