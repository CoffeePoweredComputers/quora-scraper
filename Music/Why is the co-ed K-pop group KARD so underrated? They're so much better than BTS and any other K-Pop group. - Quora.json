            "answer_text": "Honestly, it's all subjective. You may think KARD is superior, while others prefer BTS, NCT, TWICE, Red Velvet, etc. You can\u2019t just say \u201cKARD is better\u201d or \u201cso and so is better\u201d. It's all about the opinion. Now, statistics. I\u2019ve only gotten into KARD recently (I ordered the Big Tiddie Gang hoodie CANNOT wait for it to arrive help ashdkajk), and as far as I remember, KARD debuted in 2017. Their company isn\u2019t well known compared to the Big Three (or Four, if you will): DSP Media. I literally do not know any group from that company other than KARD. So, if you compare them to BTS or Blackpink (for example), both of those groups already have an advantage of (1) longer time/experience; (2) a more well-known company; (3) their fandom isn't as big, simple as that. There are SO MANY groups with SO MANY bops, yet do they get the hype they deserve? No. Are there groups who don\u2019t deserve the immense hype they have as of now? Yes. Life isn\u2019t fair, and It sucks. We also have to take into account there are FOUR members, two males, two females. As a kpop fan, (me, as an example), I stan more male idol groups, while I like to listen to girl groups\u2019 songs individually. There are people who prefer girl groups over guy groups, and vice versa, while KARD falls in the middle of that whole gist. Not to mention how KARD members aren\u2019t as conservative- with the BTG meme, lots of English, etc, their Korean fandom probably isn't as big as they deserve. An idol (group) gets fame/success not just by themselves. Without their fans support, how can they sell their albums, have concerts, and who would they interact with? If you want more people to stan KARD (or any group, really), as a fan, you should work hard for them to be known, as well. Start a fan account! Talk about them casually to your family members, or recommend some songs you think your friends may like. The bare minimum you can do for your idol (group) is to stream, stream, stream! Stream on Spotify, apple music, youtube, your pick! The idol cannot control everything. It is also the fans\u2019 job, too. All in all, it\u2019s all subjective, but I added some factors that might contribute to why KARD doesn\u2019t get the recognition they deserve, hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't mean to be rude, but\u2026 it is because of ppl like u, Kard and many other underrated groups aren't getting enough attention. You have time to post a question by downgrading BTS, but think properly, did u vote for kard in every voting poll? In every voting app?. Did u stream( which isn't that necessary\u2026 ) ? If u could have voted or streamed in the time u wrote the question, u could have helped for ur fave to grow. This was what armies were superior, instead of dragging others, we made sure to vote for BTS in every category and every poll possible. We streamed their mv to break records and make the world see them. The main reason why smaller groups don't shine is because, smaller fandoms should start working on their faves instead of trashtalking bigger fandoms. Plan voting parties and streaming parties within ur fandom, make sure to promote ur faves. I am hoping for the day when the entire kpop fandom will stop trashtalking bts and start promoting their own faves. U guys are the reason y BTS is still shining and other smaller groups are underrated. So come out of BTS BUSINESS and start promoting ur fave. And still ppl say Armies and blinks are toxic. We just defend our faves when y'all trash talk and then we are labelled toxic. Call us toxic or call our faves overrated, that isn't gonna change the fact that Armies are the most loyal fandom in the planet. I can accept, BTS isn't the BEST, but ARMIES are loyal and care about promoting our faves , not degrading other artists. So, go and promote ur fave, Hope u understood the reason why KARD is underrated. ",
