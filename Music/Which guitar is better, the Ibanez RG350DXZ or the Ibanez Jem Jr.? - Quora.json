With Ibanez, higher numbers usually equals better, though there are exceptions and lemons at every level. Overall, I'd expect the Jem to be built just a little bit better, although the difference in quality isn't likely enough to justify the upcharge on the Jem unless the monkey grip and cosmetic differences are worth another $50-$100.

In addition, the RG350 is less expensive. Unless looks are important to you, save a few bucks and go for the RG350. ",
