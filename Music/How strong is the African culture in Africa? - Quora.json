            "answer_text": "First of all, there's nothing like African culture, just as there's no, say, Asian or European culture. There are lots and lots of cultures. Every sub-tribe, every tribe, in every country and every region has varied cultures. Some have strong cultural beliefs, norms, and practices, some are weaker, and some even have their cultures eroded or assimilated. I am a Samor, a Tugen sub-tribe. Our culture is a little different from the other Tugen sub-tribes. Tugen itself is a sub-tribe of Kalenjin. Tugen has a culture different from the other Kalenjin sub-tribes. Kalenjin belongs to the Nilotic group. Nilotes have vast cultures, varying according to location, way of life, country etc. I hope you get the point, African cultures are very many and very varied, with all degrees of strength. ",

            "answer_text": "There are hundreds of tribes in Africa with different cultures. A country like South Africa has about 11 official languages. Nigeria has over 520 indigenous languages. Kenya has at least 68 tribal languages. Zimbabwe has 16 official languages. In countries like Botswana, there is one indigenous language spoken by the majority (Tswana). So there you are, these various examples show you how diverse African cultures are. Among major tribes, you may have sub-tribes and clans among them. The traditional dressing might also be different among them. However, there are certain customs that are common among African cultures of a certain group, for example the payment of bride price (Lobola) when a groom is engaged and getting married. Bride price is found in several African countries. I also came across a post on Quora about African food and cuisine. People wrote about the traditional food in their country, and what I noticed is that although the menu list had a different name, it was the same food prepared in other countries. African tribes may share certain customs and high percentage of sister languages, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they get along. For example, some Zulus may deny that Ndebele is highly intelligible with Zulu language, although that is the truth. Zulu, Xhosa and Ndebele belong to the Nguni tribal group of South Africa. Talking about the establishment of African cultures and how deep-rooted they are in this modern society is another thing. This depends on how much pride people have in their culture and traditions. You have tribes who still practice their tradition, and dorning traditional dresses on regular occasions. You have tribes who have partially or completely lost their traditions due to western influence. Some tribes have even forgotten or are uneducated about their traditional dressing. Fortunately, you have countries like South Africa where the society is highly westernized, but people still celebrate their traditional attire during special events and festivals. You can identify a Zulu, Ndebele and Xhosa traditional attire. They are quite different. Zulu traditional attire:  Xhosa traditional attire:  Ndebele traditional attire:  Look, traditional culture is still respected and followed in most African countries. When you plan marriage, attend a funeral, greet elders, get your girlfriend pregnant or visit somebody's home, there are customs that you have to follow.
