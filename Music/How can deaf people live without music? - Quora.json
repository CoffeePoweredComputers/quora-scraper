            "answer_text": "Like Don Grushkin, I\u2019m also offended by the tone of incredulity and the underlying audism behind OP\u2019s question. In addition to what Don has shared in his answer (all of which are true), I would also add this: It is not only possible, but quite EASY for many Deaf people to live without music. In my case, I was born Deaf. It does not mean I hear \u201cnothing,\u201d or that I don\u2019t know what sounds mean. Far from it. I understand what sounds mean, and that almost everything will produce a sound, and some of them will produce vibrations that can be felt. But what you must understand, OP\u2026vibrations by themselves don\u2019t tell us much. For example, vibrations only let us know that the sound is low-pitched or high-pitched and whether it\u2019s being transmitted continuously or intermittently. That\u2019s it. Nothing else. Vibrations don\u2019t tell us if the sound is pleasurable or annoying. Vibrations don\u2019t tell us if the sound contains words. Vibrations don\u2019t tell us if the quality of sound is top-notch or what. After a while, vibrations by themselves can and do become BORING. Yes. Boring. Boring. Boring. Got that? There\u2019s nothing inherently fascinating or exciting about vibrations. (Vibrators for women, on the other hand\u2026but that\u2019s a different subject.) My ears don\u2019t work well enough to appreciate all the nuances of music. My ears can\u2019t even identify various instruments used in any piece of music, except for drums, which are easily identifiable by feel. Again, drums? How many times can I feel drumbeats before it gets old? Surprisingly short time. It gets old fast, because there\u2019s not really all that much variations between drumbeats in themselves. We don\u2019t really learn anything new or get much out of drumbeats in general. On top of all of that, my ears cannot distinguish voices and words in music (or news or any other audio recording). I will always need captions OR interpreters to know what is being said or sung. The inclusion of a third party means what I am watching is being filtered through whatever the captioner or interpreter does, and it affects my perception. It\u2019s not just me and this piece of music. It\u2019s me, this person, this person, and however how many other people who tell me their assessment of this piece of music. That\u2019s not really ideal. I don\u2019t like not having autonomy. I want to be able to judge something for myself\u2026and I simply cannot do that, with my own ears. So\u2026instead of staying either in denial about what my ears can or cannot do, or trying to pretend to enjoy music to please ignorant hearing people like you, which is the true hell of audism that YOU want me to stay in, in order to please you. I prefer to be honest with myself and eschew music. I get to retain my autonomy. My honesty and my willingess to stand up for myself has freed me from the constant denial and the constant pretending. I don\u2019t want to be in Audism Hell and I refuse to go along with what hearing people want. It\u2019s not worth it. Instead of expecting ME to act like a hearing person, how about recognizing that not everything in life can be shared in exact same way? It does not mean my life sucks. NO. My life is wonderful, thank you. My born-Deaf children would also say the same about their lives. Stop imposing your hearing-centered perceptions on Deaf people. It\u2019s ableist\u2026as well as audist. ",

            "answer_text": "They don't, clearly all the deafs just curl up and die without music to bring their life meaning and joy and the beautiful Deaf woman beside me is a zombie, oh no! Unlike those of us that hear the Deaf can choose if they want to have anything to do with music of any kind and some do and some don't, personally there are times I think this gives them a huge advantage over us. Don Grushkin already covered visual music better than I could so I'll stick with the kind hearies assume is both the only kind and can only be experienced with the ear holes. My girlfriend is Deaf and there is a decent chance her classical music education surpasses yours dear audist OP, for sure it is greater than mine. Just because they don't experience sounds the same way that we do doesn't mean they are insensate. She can read sheet music and play the piano, things she decided she wanted to learn for fun as a kid. She can hear music with her body by feeling the vibrations and has listened to many instruments being played by touching them and can tell the difference between them. She has corrected people on composition questions on people I didn't even know existed, total music nerd! And it isn't just classical music, my born Deaf unicorn kicked my butt knowing answers to a music trivia game show we watched part of the other night, song lyrics are a form of poetry and she enjoys poetry. Moral of the answer: The Deaf are not sad creatures living pathetic silent existences, they are simply human beings who do not hear. They may or may not care about something you clearly think is a valuable part of your life, personally I find it disturbing when someone makes music that utterly important but you do you. ",

A friend of mine who met me to invite to his wedding, even mentioned that the only thing he felt so sorry about me being deaf was that I miss out on music. I really felt sorry for his fiancee. I was hearing once upon a time and although it was a long time ago, I could remember what it was like to listen to a favourite song. Sure it was nice. But I don\u2019t care now. I really don\u2019t. I mean what\u2019s the point, even if I care? So to answer your question, deaf people live without music, just as how some people live, with an utter lack of sensitivity in their minds to not ask ridiculous, inconsiderate, inaccurate and nonsensical questions. While these people can change by becoming a little more compassionate and a lot less stupid, we cannot change ours and some may even choose not to, even if they had a choice. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is quite offensive in its underlying premise, that Deaf people are suffering because we don\u2019t hear music, therefore our lives are joyless and meaningless. Cue the wails, the gnashing of teeth, the lamentations of our misfortune at having been born Deaf, that we cannot experience the joy of sound, the wonders of music! Not so. Yes, it\u2019s true that music is an element of life that brings joy and vibrancy to any culture. But there is nothing that says music has to be an auditory experience. As Deaf people, we experience life visually, and for us, music is a visual experience. Watch the ripples on a lake, and how the reflection changes with the movement \u2014 is this not music?  Or the murmuration of a flock of starlings \u2014 tell me you can\u2019t see the music in this:  Ella Mae Lentz, a well-known Deaf Poet, created a poem expressing this very idea of seeing music in our everyday visual life:  We don\u2019t appreciate music solely as a natural phenomenon \u2014 we create music of our own. There are Deaf cheers/songs with a 1\u20132, 1\u20132\u20133 beat:  And, my personal favorite, from the movie \u201cIn the Land of the Deaf\u201d \u2014 in this one, a whole orchestra explodes in my head every time (in fact, I wish more Deaf would experiment with creating sign-based songs in this vein, instead of doing the whole humdrum sign-supported music translations of Hearing music):  So, to answer your question, we get along just fine, because we HAVE music \u2014 it just isn\u2019t YOUR kind of music!

            "answer_text": "I have a large music collection: LP\u2019s, CD\u2019s, and even mp3\u2019s. I never learned to play and my singing was always dreadful but music was important to me for most of my life. Gradual hearing loss forced me to abandon music collection. I can detect when music is playing but it\u2019s all a smeared out mush. I can\u2019t make out the words in songs. I can\u2019t detect rhythm. I can\u2019t sense melody. I can\u2019t make out harmony. Timbre and texture are completely gone. Singing in church used to be a pleasure. I never cared for the lyrics to most hymns but I enjoyed the opportunity to sing loudly without anyone complaining about how badly I sang. That\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t follow the music any more. Only the preachy and unartistic lyrics remain. Friedrich Nietzsche is supposed to have said that \u201cWithout music, life would be a mistake.\u201d There was a time when I felt that way. But I learned that life is rich. There is so much else out there for me to enjoy. There\u2019s nature, visual arts, using one\u2019s hands, food, composing answers for Quora, books, other people, and most splendid of all, there\u2019s love. Imagine a huge banquet with lots of different foods in front of you. Your physician has recently told you to avoid eating wheat products on account of celiac disease. Do you spend your time moaning about not being able to eat bread or do you enjoy all the other delicious foods in front of you? So Nietzsche was wrong. What he should have said is \u201cWithout an ability to appreciate the world\u2019s gifts, life would be a mistake.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The one thing I have learned having gone from what I thought was hearing to mostly deaf is that all sound is subjective. Sound can equate different in someone elses head. I was a ballet dancer for many years. I assumed that how I heard the music was what everyone heard. It never occurred to me that it could sound different to someone else. Then I got bluetooth music streaming (corrected to my hearing loss) hearing aids. I played a song I had previously choreographed dance to- Bohemian Rhapsody. I had never heard all of the song. There was a whole lot of stuff in there I was not aware of. This explained to me why some of the dancers always performed it different from my choreography. But my point is- The song and the choreography still had meaning even though what we heard was different. I danced for years among dancers that likely heard the music \u201ccorrectly\u201d while I did not hear it the same. Other that being off the music sometimes that I didn\u2019t understand, I adapted and fit in quite well. I taught ballet for many years before I even knew that I heard things \u201cdifferently.\u201d So\u2026 I hear music as what I hear and enjoy it that way. I am ok with the fact that what you hear is different. We can still choose to like or dislike a song. I don\u2019t live without music, it is just different for me. And as it should be\u2026 different for everyone. ",

The senior class always had a song they signed as their theme. \u201c You lift me up\u201d was extremely moving and appreciated by family hearing and deaf! Prom we had music and dancing. The music was loud and in a room with wooden floors so vibrations were amplified. But music we had. There are deaf performers who sign to music. ",
