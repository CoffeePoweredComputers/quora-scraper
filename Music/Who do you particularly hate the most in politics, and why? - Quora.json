            "answer_text": "They\u2019re fucking ridiculous. I swear to god, no one could have come up with a better way to to make tension. In politics, you are literally deciding how people should and should not live, what people can and cannot do, what people should and should not give from their money, and so many other things. When the very basics of your life are at question, how does every political person NOT have a homicide on their record?! And I\u2019m not trying to refer to any specific party or organization or belief, I\u2019m referring to politics. Plus, the amount of listeners people like these get:   (I don\u2019t watch either of these channels, so I apologize if these two aren\u2019t as bad as I imply) Fox News and CNN. Possible the two major news station in the US, and possibly the most biased. Their job should be to give the news, not to take sides! And it\u2019s obvious that Fox News is remarkably right, and CNN is remarkably left. The worst part is that the people that accept these networks as their main source of news accept what they say as fact, and undeniably correct. And the thing is that I can\u2019t blame them, or can anyone. It\u2019s human nature to take sides, and I can\u2019t shit on the viewers unless I take a massive dump on my acne-ridden forehead. I\u2019ve taken sides before. (I\u2019m not in any way trying to insult the viewers of these news channels, just the channels themselves). The point is, the news is biased. And then there\u2019s this:  Remember this commercial? A bunch of celebrities explaining why Trump is bad? Most are Hollywood celebrities, most are liberal, many live in LA. Celebrities get way too much damn attention with politics. Why should we listen to them? Because their job involves being famous as a side affect? They\u2019re just people. And this isn\u2019t just on the left side of the fence. It\u2019s hard to find famous right wing celebrities in the same fame tier as these guys, but they\u2019re out there, and you need to know this: Their opinion is no more powerful than yours. It\u2019s people that take their opinion as word of god that give these celebrities power. Thanks for reading all the way through. I tried to stay as neutral as I could. I\u2019m not abstinent to politics either. ",

            "answer_text": "Newt Gingrich. Yeah he\u2019s a has been but very few people have done as much damage to the country as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia. The modern hyperpartisanship was a deliberate and desirable outcome of Newt\u2019s twisted mind. His hypocrisy has almost no equal in the annals of American History. This guy popularized the term\u2019s \u201cFamily Values\u201d and \u201cMoral Majority\u201d while he got his wife to sign divorce papers while still under anasthesia from cancer surgery. So he could take all the money and skip off with his mistress. Meanwhile he was waging war on a President for sexual terpitude. He routinely sticks other people with bills. Especially now that he only runs for office to pad his pockets when money gets tight. His last two bids are full of unpaid bills with small local print shops and banquet halls. He shows up on tv and gives dreadful advice, backs absolute scumbags and is constantly trying to hitch a ride on some culture war that has never quite set off. There are others I despise but Newt is the absolute bottom of the trash heap. My Grandmother, a woman who never spoke ill of anyone and seldom second guessed my grandfather loudly proclaimed Newt Gingrich a \u201cscumbag\u201d while he was representing her home state, but not her district. That sentiment was shared by most of those older farm women in the family. One great aunt was wondering how stupid the men have gotten to keep electing that \u201ctwerp\u201d. Louis Gohmert is a current degenerate but he doesn\u2019t have any power. Newt did and he did serious harm to his own party and as a result, the country when he wielded it. In the end, he was so bad, his own caucus ran him out. He would\u2019ve been the worst Speaker in American History if not for the little coward with that title now. Yet Ryan only exists because of the rot that Gingrich introduced. ",
