            "answer_text": "\u2018We Are the World\u2019 was performed by USA for Africa artists. All artists performing on this song were American. Paul McCartney is British. Therefore he was asked to perform in the Band Aid Charity Supergroup. Paul was unable to attend so he sent a recorded message of support instead. So did David Bowie. Band Aid was a charity supergroup featuring mainly British and Irish musicians and recording artists. It was founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for anti-famine efforts in Ethiopia by releasing the song \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" for the Christmas market that year. On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, and was released in the UK on Monday 3 December. The single surpassed the hopes of the producers to become the Christmas number one on that release. Three subsequent re-recordings of the song to raise further money for charity also topped the charts, first the Band Aid II version in 1989 and the Band Aid 20 version in 2004 and finally the Band Aid 30 version in 2014. The original was produced by Midge Ure. The 12\" version was mixed by Trevor Horn. There you have it. USA for Africa performed \u2018We Are the World\u2019. Band Aid performed \u201cDo They Know It's Christmas?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "We are the World was an all-star charity single was inspired by Band Aid, the British group Bob Geldof put together the year before to record \"Do They Know It's Christmas?.\" Band Aid, which included Bono, Phil Collins, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, and Sting, served as a template, showing how a disparate group of famous artists could come together in one day to record a song. This was recorded at A&M Studios in Los Angeles on January 28, 1985, the night of the American Music Awards. Since the artists were all in town for the awards, it was much easier to get them together to record the single. ",
