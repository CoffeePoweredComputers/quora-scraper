            "answer_text": "Depends on the setting. In the studio, Lata Mangeshkar in her heyday was way ahead of just about everyone except perhaps Asha Bhonsle with whom it was more neck-to-neck. Shreya Ghoshal has herself acknowledged her as her biggest inspiration (which is obvious anyway). BUT\u2026live, I think Shreya Ghoshal is a better singer. Maybe I am biased because I did get to see Shreya Ghoshal perform live. But I have also heard many live recordings of Lata Mangeshkar. While they were technically flawless (at least the ones before the 90s), I found her too insistent on matching the original note-for-note. No new inflections or variations. In a Shreya Ghoshal concert, you will be bombarded with new harkats until you stop keeping track and just bask in the sheer aural delight. She is also very imaginative in re-interpreting a song without changing its essence; I heard her give a spectacular rendition of Kya Janu Sajjan. I am not even getting into how effectively she uses the stage to interact with the audience. No, just sticking to the singing alone, I found her to be a more expressive performer. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends. Those who have heard Lataji more will choose her and those who have heard Shreyaji more, will go for her. I was first introduced to music with Lataji's song. So she had been my favourite for a long period of time. But when I heard \u201cpiyu bole\u201d, it just blew me away.That little string of laughter was enough to make me fall in love with that voice without knowing the name of the singer. Then I started to follow Shreya Ghoshal. To me Shreyaji is a complete singer and way more versatile than Lataji. Lataji is my first love where as Shreya Ghoshal is my ultimate love when it comes to music(till now as I don't know about future). Lataji had a certain kind of voice and approach where she was, is and will be the best. But I have never heard her singing low pitched songs and it is too difficult for a singer having high-pitched voice to sing low-pitched songs. I may be wrong in that because it is not that I have heard all of her songs. But Shreya Ghoshal had sung low pitched melodies like \u201cO Saathi re\u201d despite having a Soprano voice. And of course, she is versatile to the tee. More over,I like Shreya Ghoshal as a person who never needed suppress others for her own success like Lataji did. Though these are only allegations against Lataji but there must be some truth in it. One or two allegations can be ignored but not numbers of the same.There ate numerous instances where Lataji had been accused of doing so. Now a days it is not about 3\u20134 singers ruling the industry like the earlier scenario. But still Shreya Ghoshal managed to be the leading one for almost 20 years. Of course, Shreya Ghoshal is way more successful in South Indian music industry. So, I personally prefer Shreya Ghoshal above Lataji though she will always be my first love. Regards. ",
