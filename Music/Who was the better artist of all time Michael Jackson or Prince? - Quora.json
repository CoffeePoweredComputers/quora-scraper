            "answer_text": "Listen \u201cbetter singer\u201d or who I \u201cprefer\u201d are not part of what I\u2019m about. I\u2019m about appreciation, increasing the value of a something, or a somebody, because of my admiration for their virtuosity. That said, let me say that I love Michael and Prince for different reasons. I\u2019m 53 and I spent my first 31 years or so moving, and living, in different places, at different times. I was also raised and loved, especially in my early years, in the company of musicians - Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Stewart Levine - whose influence is deep and rich in me. I grew up with Michael - loved all that Motown stuff when I was in L. A., watched the Jackson 5 cartoons when I was in Athens, Ohio, even have dim memories of actually seeing the Jackson 5 in concert, Janet came out and did her Mae West routine. When I went to St. Patrick\u2019s High School, in Monrovia, Liberia at every house party we ever had, and there were a lot over 3 years, Dancing Machine, Shake Your Body Down To The Ground, Can You Feel It, Heartbreak Hotel, Blame It On The Boogie, Enjoy Yourself - you HAD too have those records if you were going to throw any kind of party! And when Michael dropped Off The Wall - it was the perfect album for us teens - slow jams, hot dance toons, groovy cool lip twisting songs - don\u2019t know how that record was received in the US, but in Liberia, it was like Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club as far as we were concerned. Also remember that in 1974 The Jackson 5 performed, and spent a little time, in Senegal - there\u2019s even a documentary about it floating somewhere out there (Jackson 5 in Africa - Directed by Mamadou Johnny Secka). So West Africa was quite tuned in to The Jacksons. Even Janet had a bit of a hit with \u201cSay You Do\u201d, off her first record. By the time Michael came out with Thriller, I was back in the States at Haverford College and in New York, upstate and in the city, and deep into my MTV. I still liked me some Michael, but with Thriller, Bad, Dangerous and HIStory he became, for me anyway, part of a firmament of stars, the music ever slicker, ever shinier, (Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Something, Bad, Man In The Mirror, Human Nature) and I missed that down home Michael - chicken-greasy fingers, hair grease and soap smelling girls, boys with combed-out naturals and banana seat bikes, skateboards and skip ropes. Michael followed an entertainer\u2019s path, he was a song and dance man, who watched James Brown from the wings, manchild on the chitlin\u2019 circuit. Michael loved to dance - look at his work in The Wiz, and of course, all his choreography over his solo career. Think Sammy Davis Jr (  ). Michael was in the vein of a Lena Horne, a Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennet, polished show business. Yeah he wrote some stuff, but throughout his career, especially solo, he always had a PRODUCER whom he worked closely with crafting the music. The theatricality of his live performances - angels and children, and fireworks and bright, bright lights. Michael invented, and patented, a shoe, remember that. So yeah, Michael\u2019s my friend, who moved to Hollywood a became a BIG STAR, he \u2018s still my friend, but we don\u2019t talk as much we used to, but when we were talkin\u2019 - Got To Be There, ABC, Never Can Say Goodbye, Ben, Rockin\u2019 Robin, I\u2019ll Be There, The Love You Save and all of Off The Wall - those videos Thriller, Billie Jean, Remember The Time, In The Closet, Beat It, The Way You Make Me Feel, Black & White - I will always love Michael. Prince is a whole other miracle. Plays all the instruments, except the horns and the strings, writes all the songs - music AND LYRICS (ALL THOSE LYRICS), sings ALL the parts, is his own (and the band\u2019s) stylist and hair, intimately involved with all fashion choices, and the creative detail of the album sleeve, CD cover, and disc appearance and is sussed about publishing. And maybe not quite as ALL OF EVERYTHING as that, but damn near, damn near. And a seemingly endless well of remixes, non-album tracks, 12 inches, b-sides, written songs and entire albums produced for other artists, carelessly strewn about, like so many poppies in a field. If you had bought every Prince release, in every format, including cassette singles, cd maxi- singles, 12 inches, foreign import mixes, and all other manner of formats that we were drowned in in the 80\u2019s, from the very first 94 East recordings to Hit n Run Phase Two you STILL wouldn\u2019t have all of his recorded output, and I\u2019m not even talking about live performances, jam sessions, and those little guest moments - Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame here and sit in with a hotel band there - never mind THE VAULT. As a recording and performing artist Prince is a BEHEMOTH of an artist, such as we have never seen. And for every time Prince might\u2019ve lurched in an unexpected direction, there thousands more times we rolled together - My Love Is Forever, Cindy C, Pink Cashmere, Girl, Elephants & Flowers, Pop Life, It\u2019s About That Walk, Papa, It, How Come U Don\u2019t Call Me Anymore, Horny Pony, I Love U In Me, Vicki Wating, Montains, BEAUTIFUL, Gett Off (Housestyle), Push, Forever In My Life, Eye No, I Will, Joy In Repetition, 1999, Partyup, Let\u2019s Pretend We\u2019re Married, The Morning Papers, Sexuality, 17 Days, Scarlet Pussy, Now, Come, Adore, Walk Don\u2019t Walk, For You, Love 2 The 9\u2019s, Gotta A Broken Heart, Baby, Starfish & Coffee, Black Muse, The Same December, Count The Days, Sometimes It Snows In April, I Would Die 4 U (extended live version), All The Critics Love U In New York, The Everlasting Now, The Ladder, Wonderful Ass, Round And Round, Baby I\u2019m A Star, The Rest Of My Life\u2026and that\u2019s just a taste. If music is LOVE, then Prince is MUSIC. Two beautiful brothers who I will always adore and appreciate. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a classic debate from the eighties. Both great artists in their own right, and while music is subjective and I do love MJ, I\u2019m not sure there was anything he could do that, at least technically, Prince couldn\u2019t do better. I\u2019ll break it down Instruments: Obviously there\u2019s no comparison here. Prince was a musical polymath who could play almost anything, better than almost anyone. Major Edge Prince Songwriting: Both wrote a number of classic pop songs, but Prince was far more prolific, writing almost all his own material from the beginning as well as numerous hits for other artist such as Chaka Khan, The Bangels, and Sinead O\u2019Conner. Edge Prince Voice: MJ had a great voice and I can certainly understand if some people prefer it, though Prince had the greater vocal range E2-B6. Slight Edge Prince. Dancing: I would say this one is closer than you think. Elaborate choreographed dance numbers were a big part of MJ\u2019s concerts and music videos and he clearly put in the work, but Prince could get down with anyone. The man could break dance in high heels. I would say he was at least the more athletic dancer. Slight Edge MJ Music Videos: Here\u2019s where\u2019s Prince\u2019s control freak DIY ethic breaks down. Prince directed many of his own videos and obviously exerted a great deal of control and the results were not always pretty, they simply don\u2019t compare with MJs. Jackson had the good sense to collaborate with top directors to produce music videos that were appointment viewing. Major Edge MJ In general Jackson\u2019s greater willingness to collaborate was one of his relative strengths. MJ couldn\u2019t play the guitar like Prince, but Eddie Van Halen could, so MJ worked with him. Whereas Prince insisted from the beginning that he should produce all his own material MJ knew he needed Quincy Jones and others. To me one of the major difference is that Prince was more driven as an artist than MJ, who was of course pushed into show business by his father. Prince knew what he wanted to be and achieved it for himself. ",
