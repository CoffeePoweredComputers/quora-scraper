            "answer_text": "In my opinion they are not ready to be a group or a K-pop group. They debuted in the UK (even though they are a k-pop group). Honestly, couldn\u2019t they just have been a pop group like Little mix or fifth harmony with a cuter concept. That would have been soo much better. Umm\u2026. also there is a lot of problems with the group: K-pop train for at least 6 months or years for their debut. These guys haven\u2019t had that intense training period and it can be really seen in their MV. There is a lot lacking in that group. Out of vocals, rap and dance, I would say the dancing is the worst. They are not in sync and their use techniques is really poor. This can be really seen in \u201cAs if its your last\u201d cover dance.I also heard Chunseo was a koreaboo and the fact that she ships her-self with jungkook\u2026 that\u2019s a little extremeThey have managed to anger blinks (someone said dance lazy like Jenny), armys and orbits (because Kaachi\u2019s logo is similar to Loona\u2019s logo).So I mean, with so many problems and unwanted attention, I can only imagine the amount of hate the girls receive. This is not a hate post but I really think their image as a respectable group is sorta tarnished and they definitely need more training. With a little more help I think Nicole could become a great dancer. So, for now, I would not consider them as a K-pop group but amateurs. -JLee ",

They didn\u2019t debut in Korea. I think they\u2019re basically just a normal girl group who sings some lines in Korean. That doesn\u2019t make you a K-Pop group. If that was the case, ANY group could be a K-Pop group if they wanted to. ",
