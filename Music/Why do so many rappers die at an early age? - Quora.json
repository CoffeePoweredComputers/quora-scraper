Beefs in the rap game go back to the late 70s/early 80s and serve to glamorize nothing in the end. Eazy E or ODB, health issues that may or may not follow any style of musician, Lil Peep just like Bradley Nowell of Sublime\u2026accidental overdose\u2026the life span of a rappers career has most definitely shortened - almost down to 3 years from 5 years (evaluated last year) unless you can sustain under good management and a determined vision (Jay Z, Will Smith, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Redman, Method Man & the rest of Wu-Tang, Drake, etc.) but I would re-phrase to state \u201cwhy do so many musicians die at an early age?\u201d and the collective answer from all of mentioned suggestions above is \u201cburn out\u201d & \u201clifestyle\u201d\u2026\u2026world tours & label demands will kill you off time and time again\u2026..unless you have a good team and keep your vision at heart. The artist formerly known as Prince passing away is a testament to the demands a musician must undergo to be number 1. Hope that sheds a little light. Keep in mind today\u2019s \u201cnew school/emo\u201d rap culture has glorified drug abuse and hard core DIY grind until you hit a billion on YouTube - more than any other artistic culture this generation has witnessed. We\u2019ve lost way too many artists over the past 3\u20134 years and they are not all rappers. Rest In Peace Chester Bennington, Avvici, XXX, and so many others- ",

            "answer_text": "What else other than drugs, violence and depression. For example juice wrld a young rapper died recently probably due to overdose and the reason why he did drugs was probably because he had wounds in his heart that he could not heal and could only make himself feel better by doing drugs. Rappers are seen as tough and strong people who do not have any problems which is not the case. People these days need to learn how to talk to others about their problems and not feel weak for doing so. Talking about your problems is something that takes courage and time. Juice wrld was a talented man and it is sad to know that he is gone forever. Most people thought he was just bluffing in his song about how sad his life is and thought he was very lucky to be famous. I am pretty sure only a couple of people knew that there was something wrong with him. RIP Juice wrld i hope others take this as a lesson and that this does not repeat again. And a middle finger to all those rapping about how good drugs are. Making it look like a good thing even though they know that it\u2019s really bad just so that they can get views.  Bye JUICE WRLD I will miss u ",
