            "answer_text": "Stockhausen\u2019s main claim to fame outside of academic circles is his use of tape editing and manipulation as a means of composing new music from scratch. We take it for granted now that recorded music can be raw material for creativity\u2014that idea is the basis of hip-hop and many forms of electronic music. Stockhausen did not influence much of that music directly (he was totally contemptuous of popular music) but he did influence some iconic musicians. He inspired the Beatles to try tape manipulation, and in return, they put him on the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Miles Davis cited Stockhausen as his inspiration for albums like Bitches Brew and In A Silent Way, which he created by recording open-ended improvisation and then editing them into shape. As significant as he is, Stockhausen\u2019s technological innovations are more widely admired than his actual music. Outside of academic and avant-garde circles, most people (myself included) find that his music ranges from difficult to unbearable. The idea that music needs to be difficult for the sake of being difficult has not aged well, and is mercifully falling out of fashion. ",
