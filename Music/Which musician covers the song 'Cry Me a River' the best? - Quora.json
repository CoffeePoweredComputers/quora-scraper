            "answer_text": "\u201cCry Me a River\u201d was written by Arthur Hamilton in 1953. My favorite performance is by Julie London, as in this classic recording from 1955.  EDITORIAL ADDITION: The song was originally written by Arthur Hamilton for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film, Pete Kelly's Blues (which was released in1955), but it was cut from the movie. Julie London\u2019s was the first released recording (that\u2019s Barney Kessel on guitar). Ella re-recorded it for a 1961 release (with Herb Ellis on guitar). It\u2019s since been recorded by a score of fine singers (particularly choice, to my ear, are the recordings by Ella, Nina Simone, Diana Krall and Etta James. . .but Julie London still is tops for me). As I think about it, though, I don\u2019t think that any of these might actually be considered a \u201ccover,\u201d so much as a performance of Hamilton\u2019s song. On the other hand, it was pointed out to me that \u201cCry Me a River\u201d is also the name of a song by Justin Timberlake and Scott Storch, produced by a fellow named Timbaland, that Timberlake recorded on his debut studio album in 2002. It apparently has been performed and recorded by a slew of artists (Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, for two \u2014 I hadn\u2019t heard of any of the rest of the singers) and, since it\u2019s Timberlake\u2019s song and his original performance, these, I think, are properly \u201ccovers.\u201d Note: I hadn\u2019t previously heard of Timberlake\u2019s song, nor have I knowingly heard it nor any of its covers, so I can\u2019t weigh in on the matter.

            "answer_text": "I love that song! It's an anthem that I think is vastly underappreciated! I've listened to many different versions of it over the years, fast and slow and I've got to say that the slow versions just do not demand the attention that the rock versions do. To do this answer justice, I switched over to my Napster page and browsed through different versions. It seems like everybody and their brother has recorded this song and I gave all of them a brief listen, everybody from Aerosmith to Natalie Cole and Michael Buble. In my opinion, nobody even comes close to Joe Cocker's version. It's raw, it's gritty and it's passionate. He means what he's singing. The others were good, because they're good singers singing a good song, Barbara Streisand did pretty good, but then I got distracted by Enough is Enough, that song kicks ass! Sorry for getting sidetracked. I have to go with Joe Cocker and I can't really think of any other song by him that I really like, but he belts this one out with true conviction. He cried that river, and if she really wants him back, she better be prepared to cry that river too. He's the only one that I feel that true heartfelt message of how much he hurt. The others feel almost flippant to me. Just my opinion.  But I'd have to say that most people would probably agree that this is the best version, and it IS beautiful, but it doesn't demand your attention like Joe's does.  Please let me know what you think.
