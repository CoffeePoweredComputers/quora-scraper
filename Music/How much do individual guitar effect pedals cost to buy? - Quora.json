            "answer_text": "How much do you want to pay? The price for a guitar pedal ranges from about $20 to several hundred dollars. While most of the $20 pedals are cheap for a reason, there are some gems every now and again (see the TO800 below). Now, if you\u2019re going the pedal board route (as opposed to whatever effects your amp has), you\u2019ll really need a few to get all of the effects you will want: Overdrive/distortionChorus or flangeDelayReverbWith one of each kind of the above pedal, you can get pretty much any sound you need. So now, back to your question: What\u2019s all this cost? I have the following pedals on my board (which I built myself out of scrap plywood), along with how much I paid for it and whether I bought it new or used: Behringer TO800 overdrive pedal ($25 new, works great!)Boss CH-1 Chorus pedal ($130 new)TC Electronic Flashback Mini ($70 used)TC Electronic HOF Mini ($70 used)TC Electronic Ditto Looper ($110 new)As you can see, my comfort level is under $100 for the most part (the CH-1 was actually a gift). I personally think that this is where the best \u201cbang for the buck\u201d is. Also, you\u2019ll note that I buy used whenever I can. I feel like for the ~$400 I have invested, I have a pretty dialed in board. But other people choose to spend much more and may have well over $1000 at their feet! For me, though, as a living-room player, it\u2019s hard to justify spending that much. ",

You can pay a lot of money for hand-made, \u201cboutique\u201d style pedals and you have certain vintage and highly sought after pedals that may set you back an arm and a leg. An original Klon pedal can go for crazy money, several thousand dollars.. On the other end of the spectrum you have cheap, mass produced units you can get for a around 20 bucks or so new - less used. The good news is that there is an abundance of good effects pedals that don\u2019t cost a lot. You only need to know what you want and where to find it. ",
