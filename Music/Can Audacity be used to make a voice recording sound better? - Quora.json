            "answer_text": "Having used Audacity extensively, I can certainly vouch for it's ability to make a voice sound its best. When I turn in an audition, or use the program for narration, I almost always employ some of the many available plugins to make what I've recorded sound more pleasing to the ear. I may use a compressor to make it sound fuller and more even throughout, a high pass filter to subtly remove minor pops, etc. I typically don't want to alter my natural voice too much, to avoid angering the client when I show up and sound nothing like the audition I submitted. If I did want to change my voice, however, there are plugins that would let me do that, as well. I can change the pitch, tempo, and almost any other aspect of the performance. As Patrick has already pointed out, however, this is no substitute for having a talented, capable narrator, with a pleasant voice, to begin with. I can tell you from experience that trying to fix poor-quality narration in post-production can be excruciating, and should be avoided, if at all possible. ",

If your recording is low boost the volume with a compressor or a limiter, use the Eq to tweak the tone of your voice to get it to sound clearer and more crisp. But you'll need a good voice talent to ensure your piece is sounds consistent and even, as well as to get a good conversational sound overall. ",

You'd have to rely on boring old talent, training and experience for that.  It is possible that using Audacity could help you get a CLEARER recording of your actual voice, and that might make it easier for your listener to understand  you. ",

You can do things like modify pitch/add effects to the voice so you can change how it sounds, but if the initial person doing the voiceover work doesn't have a good cadence and natural ability to speak on mic, it's not going to improve regardless of how much post-editing you do.
