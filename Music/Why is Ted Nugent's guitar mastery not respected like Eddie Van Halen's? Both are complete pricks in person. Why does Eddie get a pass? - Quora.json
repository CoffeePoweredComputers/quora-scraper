            "answer_text": "Someone much better versed in guitar technique and terminology would do a better job at answering this, but I\u2019ll take a first whack at this. Partly, my answer is based on reading innumerable articles in music magazines and oodles of rock music memoirs, biographies and histories. Let\u2019s start with some general metrics. Ted Nugent is ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 92nd greatest guitarist of all time, not too shabby. He\u2019s within the top 100. Eddie Van Halen, on the other hand, is ranked within the top ten, at #8. Only guitarists ahead of him are all rock and R&B legends like him - BB King, Jimi Hendrix (#1), Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Jeff Beck and Chuck Berry. That\u2019s very heady company. Another metric, however subjective you measure it, is whether Jann Wenner and his handpicked judges have deemed an artist worthy of induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Nugent hasn\u2019t yet made the cut, and may never, while EVH is in there as a member of the eponymous Van Halen. And therein may rest the biggest difference between whatever someone thinks Nugent\u2019s guitar mastery is and what everyone around the world recognizes as EVH\u2019s - their impact on contemporaries and future guitarists. How many people picked up a guitar after listening to Cat Scratch Fever and Stranglehold? Six, seven? OK, may a hundred. The thousands and thousands of us wannabe harmonics and finger tappers who were inspired by \u2018Eruption\u2019 attest to the inspiration that Eddie Van Halen has had now on generations of players. That\u2019s what gets you into the Rock Hall. Also, while Eddie Van Halen\u2019s wizardry playing a guitar is uncontested, there\u2019s ample testimony to his deep understanding of the intricacies of the instrument itself. Do yourself a favor and read \u201cPlay it Loud,\u201d by Brad Tolinski & Alan Di Perna. There\u2019s practically an homage to EVH in this book that traces the evolution of the electrification of the guitar and the authors put EVH up there with Les Paul. Again, that\u2019s some really heady company. At a young age, Eddie was pulling apart his earliest guitars and swapping out factory wiring, bridges and pickups for those he felt produced the sound that he was looking for. Combine his innovative finger tapping techniques with an appreciation and knowledge of many other genres of music and an ability to meld all that curiosity and technical virtuosity into the service of an enduring line of chart-topping hit songs and you have greatness. So, it doesn\u2019t much matter if you can shred and fly your fingers over the fretboard. Nugent may be expressing what to him are heartfelt emotions, but to the general rock radio listener, this comes off a mere technical wizardry, so that Ted\u2019s misanthropy means that he will be remembered more for his right-wing nuttery and bow-killing, trophy hunting excesses. While I\u2019ve read Sammy Hagar\u2019s scathing portrait of EVH in his memoir, \u2018Red,\u2019 and accept his characterization, Eddie isn\u2019t renowned for offending anyone with dubious socio-political pronouncements, nor slain any helpless hooved ungulates, at least not that I have ever read about. So, on the one hand you have a misanthropic but capable hard rocker with a handful of ephemeral tunes to his credit and on the other hand you have an innovative musical genius who crafted unforgettable guitar licks emulated around the world, and is considered one of modern music\u2019s greatest innovators in the instrument itself. All this explains why one \u2018prick\u2019 continues to be revered while the other is reviled. ",

            "answer_text": "Eddie was far more innovative in every way. One reviewer noted of the first VH album was that \u201cit had no fathers\u201d. Very true. Nugent followed and exploited trends and didn\u2019t create them, and his blues and boogie routine stayed nailed to the floor of 1976. Others have expounded on this better than I. It is no accident that Nugent\u2019s career started to tank right after the first VH album came out. By 1980, Eddie had completely eclipsed the Nuge in guitar magazines and on the charts, with three fine albums and a massive guitar sound. Better (Much better, frankly\u2026did anyone actually like \u2018Scream Dream\u2018?) songs and a more charismatic singer didn\u2019t hurt VH one bit. The hard rock competition got much tougher by 1980\u2026 ",
