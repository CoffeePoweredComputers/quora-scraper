I Saw the Devil is a masterpiece, it is a cross between horror and crime drama and you might feel a bit depressed after watching it. But it is an amazing movie. The Host is a monster movie that everyone either loves or hates. A lot of people do love it. And of course, A Tale of Two Sisters is wonderful. ",
