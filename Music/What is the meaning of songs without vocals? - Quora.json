            "answer_text": "Do you mean what is the purpose of songs without vocals? Or do you mean do songs without lyrics still have meaning with expressly describing them in words? To answer the first interpretation, there are different kinds of music for different kinds of people and different situations. I like music with vocals when I can pay attention to the words and sometimes sing along. In my car, while I\u2019m doing dishes, etc. I like songs without vocals as background music when I am doing something where I need to focus, but want some sound to drown out the other noise around me. I usually have something on while at my desk doing work. At a gathering of friends, vocals can be distracting for people trying to have a conversation. If you are asking if there is meaning in music without words to describe the meaning, I say yes. Even without words as the principal form of expression, music can feel happy, sad, dramatic, anxious, etc. The meaning may be more vague, but still inspires a certain mood that the artist hopes to express.

            "answer_text": "Different people take very different meanings from instrumental music, and from vocal music that is sound impressions, not words, for example \u201cscat\u201d - jazz vocal solos that are sung nonsense syllables. Often the meanings are emotional, and they are usually related to the tempo, rhythm, and melodic shape of the song. Different people may derive similar emotional experiences from the same song, for instance due to its tempo, or speed of the beat. This has to do in part with physiology: a tempo faster than the heart rate is typically perceived as energizing, a slow tempo as relaxing. Melodies based on the \u201cbright\u201d major scale are considered \u201chappier\u201d than music based on minor scales. Add a major melody to a fast tempo and you hear what most people would consider to be \u201chappy\u201d music. Melodic contours that are stepwise and based on simple chords are likely to be seen as soothing, whereas more complicated and dissonant chords typically have an energizing or even abrasive effect. One musical paradox is the use of typically stimulating elements in slow tempos and open rather than dense sound structures, as in some new age music which uses dissonance, but in slow tempos. It can be perceived as soothing, although it has dissonance, and may not have a tonal center. Ultimately, each individual decides what any given piece of music means to them. ",
