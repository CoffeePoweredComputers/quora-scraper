            "answer_text": "Can anything beat Das Lied von der Erde, already mentioned in other answers? How much intense heart-wrenching can you take? If you need a further bout of being torn to shreds, here are a few pieces to ease your way in, finishing with the perfect companion piece to Das Lied. Charpentier: Depuis le jour (\u2018Since the day\u2019) from Louise. It\u2019s a ravishing aria in its own right, but if you take the few minutes needed to watch this video, Derek Jarman reveals deeper, gut-wrenching levels in his visionary segment for the film Aria, where \u201ca veteran opera singer gives her final performance, intercut by home movies of her on holiday when young and in love.\u201d The recording is of Leontyne Price, with Tilda Swinton as the younger version of the singer, Amy Johnson.  User-13691727748309034687 just pipped me to the post with the essential Scriabin work for this question, so here\u2019s something completely different: Vaughan Williams: Romanza from Symphony No 5 in D.  Korngold: Ich ging zu ihm (\u2018I went to him\u2019) from Das Wunder der Heliane. This is how Korngold sounded before arriving in the States and becoming a film composer. No points for guessing the soprano.  Schreker: Chamber Symphony. A work by a composer who was a close friend of Korngold\u2019s teacher, Zemlinsky (who also taught Schoenberg). Once you\u2019re familiar with Schreker\u2019s style - there\u2019s now quite a lot of his music on YouTube - it\u2019s not difficult to hear how much he influenced Korngold. He and Zemlinsky are pillars at each end of the bridge between Mahler and Korngold.  And the Master of Heart-Wrench himself: Mahler: Symphony No 9 in D major. Performed by the Concertgebouw Orchestra with Bernard Haitink.  ",

            "answer_text": "Mahler\u2019s powerful meditation on life, mortality and death, Das Lied von der Erde, should meet your criteria (if not your taste); it\u2019s not uncommon, but not often performed. In particular, the final segment, VI. Der Abschied (28 minutes long), is heart wrenching, especially the final, resigned \u201cEwig. . .Ewig. . .\u201d (\u201cforever. . .\u201d). There are lots of fine performances. Here\u2019s one of my favorites, performed by conductor Bruno Walter (who conducted the premiere in 1911), the Vienna Philharmonic, tenor Julius Patzak and contralto Kathleen Ferrier, who was dying of cancer when this was recorded in 1952, making her performance that much more amazing, especially the concluding \u201cewigs\u201d.  notes: 1) Der Abschied begins at about 32:00; 2) this was recorded in 1952, so the sound quality isn\u2019t up to the current state of the art.
