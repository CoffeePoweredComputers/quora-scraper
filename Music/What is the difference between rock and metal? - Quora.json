            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll assume this is not a question on geology. Although many think metal is a subgenre of rock, this is absolutely wrong. Metal is a genre in and of itself that originated from rock. Metal music tends to compose in minor scales. Pentatonics are rarely used. By rarely I mean no metal bands uses pentatonics in their compositions, except for 2 or 3 in 1 or 2 songs, which makes you feel safe to say NO BANDS WHATSOEVER. Metal music, depending on the metal subgenre, takes different emotions as a source of inspiration to express them in the most extreme possible way; hatred, love, sorrow, happiness, etc. Usually, metal bands will compose in minor keys, regardless the subgenre. Even cheerful bands will\u2026  Blast drums are also frequent in metal (almost a must) accross all of its subgenres:  Vocals may be: Harsh:  Guttural:  Clean:  Operatic:  Or screamo\u2026 not really. That\u2019s not metal. Lyrics in rock are down to earth, sometimes even naive. In metal they are almost always extremely poetic and overloaded with literary figures, regardless the topic: horror, heroism, death, grief, unattainable love, despair, hatred or even humor. Anybody saying keyboards are not present in metal, clearly knows nothing about the genre. Keybords are a significant, sometimes preponderant element in the genre (except for the most primitive cold grim black metal bands or thrash):  Metal music is usually inspired by XIX Century romanticism, both lyrically and musically. Some bands have even toured with real orchestras:  And there are some good metal songs covering famos rock hits\u2026 or even synthpop tracks\u2026    Or even local folk songs:   Metal genre is not just about one thing\u2026 but about everything taken up to its most elevated and most intense level possible.

            "answer_text": "here is my answer for your question \u2022 Rock music originated in the 1950s while metal music was invented in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a sub-genre of rock music. \u2022 Rock music has a lighter distortion in the sound where the metal music has a stronger distortion of the sound created. \u2022 The sound of metal music is deeper and higher than that of rock music. \u2022 The rhythm of metal music consists of emphatic deliberate stress while rock music has an unsyncopated stress in 4/4 time signature. \u2022 Metal music utilizes a guitar power chord while rock music does not. \u2022 Rock music lyrics associate with a wide range of themes such as love, sex, rebellion and other social concerns while metal music themes largely connect to masculinity, aggression and sex. \u2022 Rock musical bands use keyboard as one of their key instruments while metal bands occasionally uses it. Ultimately, it is obvious that rock is a main genre of music whereas metal is a sub-genre of rock that emerged later. Rock does center on the electric guitar and drum kit and does not produce much loudness while metal music produces amplified loudness by electric guitar, rhythm guitar, drum kit, lead guitar and bass guitar. Reviewing the above differences, one can clearly understand that rock and metal are different from each other. ",
