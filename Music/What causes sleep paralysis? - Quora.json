            "answer_text": "I am glad some people are happy and unafraid from Sleep Paralysis. I am going to share here how do you get sleep paralysis, but also, I want to talk a bit about sleep paralysis first, for those who still fear it. I have a blog about lucid dreaming if you want to learn about about it! Sleep paralysis can be amazing, and if we learn to control it, it is an easy gateway to both lucid dreaming and astral projection. Sleep paralysis is usually the biggest problem and concern during lucid dreaming and astral projection. Sleep paralysis usually scares the bejeezus out of those who are not used to it, and there is no blame here\u2026 But it is only a phase that is required for some induction techniques. There are ways to Lucid Dream without going through Sleep Paralysis, and if you do, there are ways to even get great advantage from them. However, in this answer we want to aim towards sleep paralysis: It is a mechanical and natural process that we all go through, in fact, it happens every time we fall asleep. The mind paralysis the body so do you don\u2019t act out your dreams. Somnambulism is a serious condition because of lack of sleep paralysis, among other reasons. If the mind is awake (you have not lost awareness), you are going to experience sleep paralysis consciously. When your mind is awake and your body is asleep, it triggers sleep paralysis. It always happens when you try to induce a lucid dream using the WILD technique, and the same goes if you are pursuing an astral projection. Do NOT MOVE nor try to move at this stage, or you will break your trance and blow it. If you want to observe it, go for it!To make sure you are all aware of this\u2026 There are no demons, dark entities, archons, reptilians, Illuminati, leeches, evil spirit or nine-legged snakes trying to eat you whole and steal your soul while a big block of concrete blocks your chest and you can't even move. Yes, sleep paralysis can be scary, very scary. However, it can be amused as well, and I am sure this is true for this question. I believe that sleep paralysis happens this way due to all the junk that humanity has in its consciousness. After all, it is just hallucinations created by our minds. Our minds pull the information from the \u201cmemory banks\u201d that we filled ourselves\u2026 But again, as I said they are just hallucinations and there is nothing wrong with them.But let\u2019s pursue sleep paralysis and \u201cmeet\u201d with those crazy visions!  So, I do have a lot of answers here about how to induce trance. Trance is only another form of sleep paralysis, so it is quite easy to reach there. I recalled right one one more way, however, it is more time consuming: An easy way to reach to sleep paralysis is with the use of a mantra. Something such as, \u201cI stay still if I wake up from a dream.\u201d Make sure to recite it in positive and present.You eventually will wake up from a dream. If you try to move or open your eyes, you blow it. You must make sure you DO NOT move at all, and to neither open your eyes.After a few moments, you will find yourself in sleep paralysis.You may wake up already in sleep paralysis.You have very little control using this method since you are at the mercy of awakening naturally from a dream.Gentle alarms will get in the way for sleep paralysis induction.Now, the usual way I always share it here. I will summarize it a little, that way I do not sound like a broken record, lol. You need to relax your mind completely. I shared here a few times the post-it exercise, for you to train your mind to remain silent for several minutes.Relax your physical body completely. Remember, if you are very tired you are not relaxed, in fact, your body might be tense. Ideally, do this if you wake up in the middle of the night, or in the morning. You can do so in the morning hours as well, but the more you wear yourself, the harder.Remain in this state of silent mind but aware, as well as a sleeping body. After a short time, you will have an itch, a need to scratch your nose, a burning sensation somewhere or even a massive need to move. Ignore these sensations, as it is only your brain testing if you are conscious or not. You can trick your brain into thinking that your physical body is asleep if you ignore this stimulus (it feels it takes forever, but it is only a moment.)Once the brain believes you fell asleep, your physical body will become paralyzed. Do not try to move or you may be going to the way of re-awakening. You will know you are in sleep paralysis because of the hallucinations.If you want to hold this state, make sure to focus on the hallucinations while you also try to focus on the fact that you are in sleep paralysis. If a dream starts to form, ignore it so you do not induce a lucid dream. If you feel vibrations, ignore them so you do not induce astral projection. Remind yourself about your sleep paralysis state.Eventually, you will either wake up, go to a lucid (nightmare?) related to the sleep paralysis (is fun, I did it as a child without knowing it), or maybe astral project.You can hold it for quite a while with this focus :) I have articles in my blog where you can read more about how to relax your body and your mind to induce trance. I hope you enjoyed the read :)  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty simple, actually. See, normally when you\u2019re dreaming, your brain paralyzes you from the neck down to prevent you from physically acting out your dreams and getting yourself hurt. The problem is that REM brainwaves and waking brainwaves are really similar in shape, meaning that under certain circumstances, your brain can occasionally get the two confused and paralyze you when you\u2019re awake because it assumes you\u2019re dreaming. There\u2019s a second aspect to it as well, albeit one that doesn\u2019t always happen. See, when you\u2019re awake, you feel emotions in response to things you experience. But dreams work a little differently. In dreams, you feel the emotion first, and then your brain crafts an experience to be the \u201ccause\u201d of that emotion. When you have sleep paralysis, since your brain believes that you\u2019re dreaming, it will sometimes attempt to do this to give a \u201ccause\u201d to your fear, even though it already has one, causing you to have vivid hallucinations. Since most people experiencing sleep paralysis are terrified, these hallucinations tend to be of something very frightening, like alien abductors experimenting upon them, or demons sitting on their chest tormenting them, or something like that, incorporating the very real fact that you\u2019re frozen, lying on your back into that dream scenario. If sleep paralysis doesn\u2019t scare you, these hallucinations can go off in a very different direction. In my second experience with the phenomenon, I was more bemused than anything, so instead of aliens or monsters, I saw an otherwise ordinary house cat with an infinitely long torso and an infinite number of legs walking across my bed. Unusual, certainly, but bemusing rather than frightening. ",
