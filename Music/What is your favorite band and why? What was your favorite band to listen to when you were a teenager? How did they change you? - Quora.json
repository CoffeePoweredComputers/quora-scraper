            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s hard to say which of the bands I listen to is the ultimate favourite but I think this has to go to Arctic Monkeys and lately, LANY and Sundara Karma. My reason for choosing AM might be strange which is for its lyrics and that\u2019s not strange unless you consider the fact that, as a non-native English speaker, the intricacy of words used by Alex Turner in Arctic Monkeys\u2019 songs at times, has helped me learn myriads of new words. The way he writes their songs is such that they can be sincere, personal whilst also cocky and confident. And its romantic too, sometimes. I absolutely love this aspect of the band and I\u2019m glad this lyrical genius continues to amaze (and teach) me. As for LANY, I absolutely love the emotional aspect, how that despite what seems like simple lyrics, the way the song is sung suggests that the singers\u2019 feeling is anything but simple. They\u2019re a band that produces music I can really relate with emotionally. Sundara Karma, on the other hand, I love them because their sound and lyrics just blew me away. I love the fact that the type of music they make isn\u2019t what I usually enjoy yet they made me enjoy it nonetheless. They also have really cool MVs which highlights the somewhat quirky characters of the members and how they perceive the world. I think they\u2019re a really special band. However, as a teenager though, I had the normal rock band obsession and the boy band obsession. So, my utmost favourite band in my teenage years was Arctic Monekys, but I was also crazy obsessed with MCR (pls have a reunion hnh). And my favourite boy band at the time was One Direction - yeah, my music taste is all over the place. What they all had in common for the teenage me was the fact that they made me feel less alone and like there was someone out there who understand how I felt and what I thought. If One Direction held the childish, happy, cutesy side of me, MCR was where my frustration, anger and sadness sometimes find a home. Arctic Monkeys was the confident side of me despite all its vulnerability and also the suave, cool romantic side. All these bands had an impact on me as they shape my music taste and my preferences. Most importantly, they made me happy, made me feel better and help me get through the days - and this is the most important thing about music or any form of art. Not sure if my answer made sense, but that\u2019s how bands I love make me feel, and that\u2019s why I love them dearly. It\u2019s just my personal experience. P.S. Youth Is Only Ever Fun In Retrospect by Sundara Karma is an amazing album. ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite band\u2026 hmhm, my answer might be strange regarding my young age of 15. I absolutely love Modern Talking and t.A.T.u. The first one is a German band/ pop duo that existed 1984\u201387 and got reunited in 1998\u201303 again. Their music can be categorized as Eurodisco/Eurodance (depending which time you\u2019re talking about). Although they\u2019re considered as one of the worst German artists ever (well, at least in their home country), they\u2019re still very popular in Russia and some other countries. It\u2019s the 80\u2019s, I swear- but they don\u2019t look bad, right ;)  Yep, it\u2019s Thomas Anders with his notorious Nora-necklace and Dieter Bohlen with his blonde mullet and almost never-sounding e-guitar. The reason I love them? Well, on the one hand, I love the soft synth sound of their 80\u2019s songs, on the other hand, Thomas Anders\u2019 voice is just amazing. I am familiar with Modern Talking because both of my parents come from the former Soviet. And when I was going through some kind of \u201cdepression\u201d, their music saved me and helped me to stay rather positive. Oh well. They might be hated a lot in my country, but let\u2019s face the facts: A band that had 5 number-1 hits in its home country can\u2019t be too bad. Now to the second one: t.A.T.u is a Russian pop duo, known for their scandalous fake lesbain image. Here\u2019s a pic:  Damn, they\u2019re hot and cute at the same time. The reason I love their music? It\u2019s rather untypical for 2000\u2019s pop and ranges from light hearted love songs to deep depressing lyrics. What\u2019s also interesting is that they came from a country most people would associate with homophobia\u2026 well, it\u2019s true, but back in their time, homosexuality was actually accepted there! Sadly, times have changed. Depending on the song you\u2019re listening to, your mood might change rapidly. If \u201c\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a-\u0433\u0435\u0439\u201d is a cheery-sounding song about the love of a girl for a gay boy, then \u201c\u0417\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043c \u044f\u201d leaves you in absolute sadness, not only because of its lyrics about a broken love, but also due to it\u2019s instrumental arrangement. Their songs mainly include LGBT romances. Maybe that\u2019s how they help me slowly accepting my bisexuality. That\u2019s it I guess. ",
