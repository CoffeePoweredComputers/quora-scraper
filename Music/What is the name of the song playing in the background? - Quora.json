            "answer_text": "What you're hearing in the background of the video is called a \"melody loop\". You'd have to ask whoever made that video what loop they chose. Check out this website... www.melodyloops.com They have a huge library of loops that you can listen to all you want. This type of music is incredibly simple and easy to produce. If you listen to around 20 or 30 of these in a row you'll hear what I mean. They're just little bits of repetitive sound engineered to put you in the right mood to buy a product. Try clicking on one of the loops and listen to it for a bit without reading the description of the loop. Then read the description. Cool, huh? By the way, I'm not affiliated in any way with the above site. It was just the first good example of what I was looking for using Google (who, by the way, used that same loop for one of their first Google Glass demo videos). ",
