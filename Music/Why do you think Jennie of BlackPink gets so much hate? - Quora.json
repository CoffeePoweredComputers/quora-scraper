            "answer_text": "(edited: 4/11/19) Jennie Kim used to be my least favorite, and in fact, she still is. But I\u2019m warming up to her now. So here we go: Choreography. Have you seen her recent live for her song, \u2018Solo\u2019? Yes, I admit, a very catchy song, but her dancing. She was dancing very lazily compared to the rest of her back-up dancers. Skipping and standing around isn\u2019t dancing! We wish Jennie, we wish it was that simple. Skipping moves and halfheartedly doing them isn\u2019t dancing. Even during, I believe, \u2018As If It\u2019s Your Last\u2019 she couldn\u2019t even bring her arm above her head. Yes, you may of performed that song hundreds of times. I don\u2019t care. It might\u2019ve been a BLINKs first time watching her favorite idol live and all you did for dancing was stand up there, rolling your eyes with a sour attitude? (EDIT) She\u2019s way better now, she\u2019s coming back to debut Jennie! Awh, what an improvement.Attitude. Jennie. Kim. She stands up there and thinks shes the YG princess. Yes, evidently she is. YG favors her\u2026 too much. She has the audacity to bully the other members (refer to Vlives and other videos). She thinks it\u2019s okay just to look pissed while performing. Guess what? It\u2019s not. So suck it up buttercup. Put up a facade, I don\u2019t care. Just don\u2019t act like a diva. (EDIT) Awh, after the little lazy scandal, she\u2019s such a cutie.Rapping. No offense to anyone that enjoys her rapping. I find it a valuable asset to any of BLACKPINK\u2019s songs. The only thing is, her rapping isn\u2019t really rapping. It\u2019s the equivalent to speaking words a bit faster. Screaming into the mic isn\u2019t rapping, sorry. She just needs a bit of work on breathing and she\u2019ll be a-okay.Singing. Her voice is mediocre. Before you lunge at me, I never said it was bad. It was just mediocre. Rapping, singing, and dancing are hard things to do, and being able to master one of those skills are impressive. I think people bring her \u201cdual talents\u201d (singing and rapping) into a much brighter light. It doesn\u2019t really deserve that much attention if you put your mind to it. Her rapping is kind of slow (refer to number 3) and her singing sounds like much of the population of the world.Stage presence. Debut Jennie was an absolute queen. She dominated the stage. What happened now Jennie? Why can\u2019t you have the charisma you had back then? Now, her stage presence seems boring, dull, and overall, disappointing. Our debut Jennie\u2019s stage presence was overwhelming. So much charisma, sass, cuteness, you name it, she had it. We want that Jennie.Outfits. Yes, sounds extremely petty, because it is. But notice, she always gets the glamorous, easy-to-move-in dresses. You may think that doesn\u2019t matter, but think about it. You have to rap or sing and do usually difficult choreography in dresses and sometimes heels. You have to move. Simple. My case is closed.The rest of BLACKPINK as her \u201cbackup\u201d. I honestly kind of agree with that. If you analyze some pictures, such as this: What do you notice? Oh, look! Jisoo, Lisa, and Rose dressed in basically all black! How nice. Oh, and who\u2019s that? Jennie dressed in pure white. Standing out from the crowd! As we can see, apparently she has the role \u201ccenter\u201d. Not just center, but \u201cspotlight\u201d. This is YG favoritism, and something that she can\u2019t really help, but I think it\u2019s vital enough. 8. Favoritism. Although this isn\u2019t really her fault, this is one of the reasons people despise Jennie. Ever since Jennie released her solo, all of blackpink_official\u2019s (BLACKPINK\u2019s official Instagram) posts were basically about Jennie. \u201cJennie\u2019s \u2018Solo\u2019 Diary\u201d, Jennie\u2019s \u2018Solo\u2019 Dance Competition, Jennie this, Jennie that. If Rose, Lisa, and Jisoo get the equal amount of attention in their solos, I\u2019ll be happy. Fair warning, this isn\u2019t why I hate Jennie Kim. This is the reasons why people hate Jennie Kim. Some of them are stupid, but I answered your question. ALSO LAY THE F*CK OFF ME FOR SAYING MY OPINION. I DON\u2019T NEED YOU TRIGGERED STANS TO COME AND RIP MY THROAT OUT. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite being a versatile artist, Jennie still gets a lot of hate and here's why: 1. FavoritismJennie is said to be treated differently from the other members by how much more expensive her outfits are, how often she appears on their music videos' thumbnail and how she's the first one to have a solo. However, if you think about it, it's not her fault that she gets treated unequally (it's not like she tells the company to do that), it's more like their management company is the one to blame. But why? Why would the company push her more than the other members? Well, it's definitely because of Jennie's styles in singing. She has an extremely powerful voice and amazing rapping skills which totally fits the image of YG Entertainment. And even her badass face and fashion fits them. But still I'm not saying it's right for the company to have favoritism, it's just they're a big company, they just do what's best for them and Jennie is their choice which she has nothing to do with.  2. Dating scandal Jennie was seen hanging out with Kai (an EXO member) on Jan 1st this year and she got so much hate for it which is ridiculous.  I don't know how much of a crazy fan you are, idols are still humans, they can date whoever they want. You support them for their talent not them being single! 3. Lazy dancing In late 2018, Jennie was spotted doing lazy dancing on stage quite a few times.  However, if you were a fan of BLACKPINK, you would know that Jennie is the weakest member in the group. She's often seen being sick, sometimes she can't even breathe properly and shaking so much. Plus at this point, she's about to release her solo so she got to work way much more than the other members. Honestly, being YG's favorite is not easy at all cause everything is brought up to you and you have to work way harder than usual.  Jennie not feeling well in an event 4. Bullying other members Recently there's been an edited video accusing Jennie of bullying Lisa. This video gained millions of views quickly which is why Jennie's instagram comment section was full of hate. Please \"only stan\" and OT3 or whatever you are, these girls have lived with each other for years and they are nothing but a family. They tease each other all the time to joke around and it's also a way for them to show love to each other. Jennie has always got hate but she never once speaks up about it but that only time Lisa got hate because she's Thai, Jennie immediately went off about it on stage. That's how much she loves and cares for other members. #jenlisa #chaennie #jensoo  5. How she looks? I was surprised myself by how many times I see comments saying they hate her cause she has a cold, unfriendly face. If you watch some Blackpink's live stream or them appearing on reality shows, you will get to see other side of all the members including Jennie. She's a caring person, a cute one, a funny one and definitely a sensitive one.  Jennie got emotional while singing on stage ",
