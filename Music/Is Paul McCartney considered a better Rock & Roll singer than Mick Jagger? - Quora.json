But on the other hand, could he sing Gimme Shelter, Sympathy For The Devil, Honky Tonk Women, Brown Sugar, Jumpin Jack Flash, and so on without sounding totally ridiculous? Of course not. Just like Jagger couldn\u2019t pull off McCartney\u2019s stuff. This is too much of an apples to oranges comparison to even try to make. ",
