            "answer_text": "Well, you asked anonymously and didn\u2019t tell me your age, so it\u2019s kind of hard to answer without any information. Oh wait\u2026no it\u2019s not. No one is ever too old or too young for any musician. If a 6-year-old wants to listen to death metal, or if an 80-year-old wants to listen to K-pop, that\u2019s fine, because no music can only be acceptable for a specific aged audience. So the answer is no, you\u2019re not. Rock on, -Quora\u2019s favorite ssssnotelek \ud83d\udc0d ",

You\u2019re on a drive with your 13-year-old daughter, and she plugs her phone into the car stereo. What\u2019s the song? \u201cPerdido\u201d, by Duke Ellington. Do you rip the plug from her phone in outrage, and lash out at her for listening to old music? No. Because music is meant to be shared, experienced, and loved by people of all ages.  Listen to whoever or whatever makes you happy. ",
