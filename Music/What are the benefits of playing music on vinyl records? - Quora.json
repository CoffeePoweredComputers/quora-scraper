            "answer_text": "What many-hard-bitten phonophiles consider to be pleasurable would be considered by lovers of digitally reproduced music to be annoyances. For example, the kinesthetic pleasures of handling both the record and its jacket may be foreign to CD or MP3 addicts, but to the phonophile, they are part and parcel of taking a pleasant and hands-on approach to enjoying music, the old fashioned way. (The phonograph dates all the way back to\u2014among others\u2014Emil Berliner,[1] the inventor of the phonograph record in the 1890s.) Rituals of cleaning records may seem to the uninitiates-to-vinyl as highly unnecessary, even annoying. To phonophiles, however, removing dust and other contaminates from a vinyl\u2019s surface elicits a pleasant feeling not easily gainsaid. I even wash a newly acquired, used record with a sponge, dish detergent, and warm water, and I then dry it with a bunch of 100 percent cotton towels (and sometimes a blow dryer) to make my records as clean as they can be. To stop the music when the phone or the doorbell rings, you simply activate the cuing device on the turntable. There is no clumsy remote control device to master. To read the liner notes on the jacket of a record, does not require a magnifying glass, generally speaking ! Moreover, the artwork on the jacket is not only larger than the artwork on a CD\u2019s liner notes, but it is also more attractive and interesting. When\u2019s the last time you framed a CD\u2019s artwork? I\u2019ve framed a good number of record jackets and display them on the walls of my abode. You get more exercise when playing records than you do when playing CDs. True, the health benefits are minimal but, again, they are not easily gainsaid. Whether analogically recorded or digitally recorded music sounds better, well, I\u2019m kind of undecided. One of the words used by phonophiles to describe analog music is warm. I guess the same folks would call digital music cool or even cold and antiseptic! Mate a tube amp and preamp with a record player, and you\u2019ll be in record Nirvana, according to some phonophiles. Tube electronics, according to fans, is not only a warmer, more natural sound reproduction, but tube equipment tends to produce a more pleasant, easier-to-take distortion. Again, I\u2019m not so sure about the science\u2014if any exists\u2014behind that claim. In short, the preference of some phonophiles for black PVC records may be traceable to their having so many of them in their collections, or their preference is simply a well-ingrained habit which they find impossible to break. In any case, I count myself among the record\u2019s biggest supporters, though I do listen to the occasional CD. In fact, I\u2019m upset that my 2017 Chevy Malibu has neither a tape deck nor a CD player. They are not even available as an optional extra! Footnotes[1] who was emil berliner",

            "answer_text": "This is an emotive one and you will see a lot of garbage spoken. To have any sort of useful discussion we have to falsely assume that most people listen with decent audio gear (and no that excludes 5.1 Home Theater & Bluetooth tubs). Vinyl does have a more limited frequency and dynamic range than CD (16/44) or FLAC files of 24/96 recordings. What vinyl does have is twofold: because vinyl is physical format, where the limits of perfect reproduction are reached and crossed, the distortions created, match real-world phenomena so we accept and even find them pleasing.because we have to physically interact with putting a record on and turning it over every 15\u201330 mins, we have a more connected feeling with the record ad music overall as we touch the cardboard of the cover art, the record itself and the machine that translates that into sound and emotion for us. This can develop some of the devotion of meditation.Digital recordings are better in every technical sense. Except when we meet the limits of perfect reproduction, then they sound terrible as their coping mechanisms don\u2019t behave like real-world objects at all. They just sound nasty in comparison. To be fair, most of these issues are largely past these days as we have largely learned how to best use the format to its advantages - including emulations of analog distortions. Digital, of course, has massive physical advantages in terms of practicality. I can carry 800+ albums around with me in my phone. The quality suffers but the practicality is worth it as I can hear any of my record collection anywhere, anytime. This does dramatically reduce the interactivity & ritual aspects of finding, choosing and playing my music. Media players largely offer collections in strange nonsensical order like alphabetical or date order instead of in a personal, emotively relevant, format that allows seeing one album cover to lead me to another that is in another crate. This stripping of connection can leave digital music feeling sterile in comparison. ",
