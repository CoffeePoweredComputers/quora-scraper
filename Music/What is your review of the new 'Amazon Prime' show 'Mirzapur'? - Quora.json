            "answer_text": "Much like the succulent mutton that a disabled patriarch enjoys in the show\u2019s pilot, Mirzapur is satisfying on a visceral level. This 9-episode Amazon Prime Original eschews both the pretense of Netflix\u2019s Sacred Games and the disregard for verisimilitude of Amazon\u2019s own Inside Edge to tell an expansive, wildly entertaining tale with plenty of heart and ache. Set in the hinterland (some would say heartland) of North India, Mirzapur traces the journey of two brothers, Guddu (Ali Fazal) and Bablu (Vikrant Massey), as they get enmeshed in the world of local don, Kaleen Bhaiyya (Pankaj Tripathi). As we vicariously follow their fresh tale through all its twists and turns, it is hard not to get swept up by this stylish, rustic world where violence rules and shocks are aplenty. The performances in Mirzapur are played at a high-scale that is comparable to traditional Hindi cinema; they are effective across the board without being groundbreaking. Pankaj Tripathi, potent in his understated machismo, is brilliant as always. Ali Fazal is great as the roided-up simpleton. The sisters, Sweety (Shriya Pilgaonkar) and Golu (Shweta Tripathi), are effective in their sweet turns, with Golu in particular being much more than a mere plot device. The well fleshed-out side characters help create a rich universe, and over the course of the show, you either care about what happens to them or want something to happen to them. The soundtrack and music, which I had no expectations from given the trailer\u2019s cacophonous \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d, is a pleasant surprise; the creators even dip into some of Excel Entertainment\u2019s own Bollywood chartbusters to help set the mood. Mirzapur is not a perfect show or a work of art by any measure. Its gore is clearly designed to titillate (thankfully there\u2019s no gratuitous nudity here). The editing feels asynchronous at times, with characters disappearing for entire episodes before resuming their arcs right where they left them, while the rest of the story moves on. And the twists, while largely effective in their staging, sometimes resolve a tad too easily. But by not taking itself too seriously and focusing on being entertaining, Mirzapur elicits a goodwill that causes viewers to paper over the few cracks that appear. All in all, Mirzapur is a thoroughly exhilarating ride. With season 1 ending an episode too soon, I for one will be waiting for season 2 with bated breath.   Spoiler-filled observations (do not read until you have seen the whole series): The \u201cLal Wedding\u201d was insane! While it no doubt takes its cues from Thrones\u2019 infamous scene, the execution was sufficiently original and tension-filled, despite the mildly annoying cuts away to other scenes. Props to the writers for having Munna go full retard; I particularly liked how he killed Bablu.There were two other standout set-pieces on the show for me: one was when Kaleen Bhaiya and the silk-dealer meet on neutral ground, only to discover that everyone else at the restaurant belonged to either of them; second was the continuous shot in the chawl-like building in Episode 7, which also had a fun easter-egg revealing that Mirzapur exists in the same universe as Inside Edge (which begs the question of why the show cast Amit Sial \u2014 the foul-mouthed Devender from Inside Edge \u2014 as the police inspector here).I found the restaurant scenes with the boy waiter really cute (despite being slightly uncomfortable due to the child-labor aspect).The Guddu-Sweety, Bablu-Golu pairings were delightful. I liked the delicate balance with which the show avoided pigeonholing Bablu and Golu as either friends or lovers.Given my annoyance with Bollywood\u2019s \u201cbad behavior gets the girl\u201d trope, I was also glad to see Guddu\u2019s delicate touch prevail over Munna\u2019s force and harassment; the show did well to ensure that the latter came across throughout as a lout and not a forlorn lover.I found Bauji\u2019s ultimate treatment of Kaleen Bhaiya\u2019s wife, Beena (Rasika Dugal), forced. It was the one thing on the show that felt contrived, to make us fear his character\u2019s ruthlessness. I\u2019d be interested to see Kaleen Bhaiya\u2019s reaction to this revelation next season though.There should really have been another episode after the 9th one to tidy up this season\u2019s end. With Bablu and Sweety dead, and Kaleen Bhaiya seemingly losing political favor, the showmakers have to tread lightly to ensure that they don\u2019t lose the plot in season 2. The show can likely not afford to kill any more primary, sympathetic characters (Guddu, Golu and Kaleen Bhaiya) before its end, which might take away some of the tension.",

            "answer_text": "After watching Mirzapur all I could think was \u201cWhat the hell was the hype all about\u201d. When I watch a crime thriller/gangster kind of series like Mirzapur I know that the characters will not be black or white but every character has shades of grey. However there must an acceptable protagonist. This person may not necessarily be good but as an audience we should be able to connect with him/her & understand his struggles, his actions, may be even empathize to some extent. My main problem with Mirzapur is there is not a single character in this show with ANY redeeming qualities. Guddu & Bablu are supposed to be the protagonist but both these characters got on my nerves especially Guddu. I did not find any difference between Guddu & the so called villain Munna who is supposed to be a desi version of GOT Joffrey. The excuse given is that Guddu & Bablu agree to work for Kaleen Bhai to save their family but as the series progress & so does their character degradation its clear that Guddu & Bablu are cut out of the same cloth. I wanted to slap that ever crazed look off Guddu\u2019s face. This psycho is more trigger happy than the villain Munna & both have the same IQ as a cuckoo clock. None of the characters or their action make sense. Guddu & Bablu\u2019s mom is ok with her sons literally being criminals. She is shown to happily accept this & even enjoy the perks which come with being a gangster mom. Guddu & Bablu\u2019s love interests look down their nose & sniff at Munna but have no qualms about their dad being a lackey of Kaleen or that their boyfriends are basically hired guns of Kaleen. The sheer hypocrisy of this irritated me not to mention the attitude by Sweety who struts around as the self proclaimed Miss Mirzapur. I pity the men of Mirzapur if this is what they are vying for. Sheesh!!!! Of course the wedding massacre is clearly a rip off of The Red Wedding in GOT. Major eye roll! The profanity is another major put off for me. I have watched other web series like Patalok, The Family Man, Special Ops, Raikar etc but no where did I watch a series as disgusting as this 1. Come on\u2026 Every single line as Chu***, MC, BC, BD etc. I mean really EVERY SINGLE FRIGGING SENTENCE! I dont think even low level gangsters swear & cuss in every single sentence. There is no subtlety, no underlying tension, no plot twists, no unexpected surprises. All we get is Guddu\u2019s crazed face in close up almost every scene. Oh & the sex scenes. Again I am not a prude. Come on I ve watched GOT for god\u2019s sake but in Mirzapur the sex scenes are so boring added just to attract eyeballs. They make u snooze. They are unaesthetic & cringey. They do not help in advance the plot. A show director knows his product is pathetic when people curse & fwd the sex scenes. Boring & stupid are not the words u want the audience to describe such scenes. A major fail & cringe level infinity. The only thing going for this disaster is Pankaj Tripathi as Kaleen. Man he is the only 1 worth watching in this train wreck & he gets lesser scenes than the psycho 1 Munna, psycho 2 Guddu, boring Bablu. Even his dissatisfied trophy wife gets more screen time than Kaleen & believe me he is the only watchable character in this entire cringe-fest. I still don\u2019t get the IMDB ratings. I would have given this disaster negative rating but only & only for Pankaj I give it 1/10. What a waste of my time & internet streaming! ",

            "answer_text": "Disappointed. 1 ) Profanity (MC/BC) can\u2019t heighten drama or thriller. (Watch Game of Thrones again if anyone has doubt). Anurag Kashyap uses it judiciously so it looks natural and leaves its impact on our minds. In Mirzapur, vulgar words seem forced. 2) The plot is very cliche here. It seems like a bad movie of Mithun Chakraborty from 80\u201390s. 3) The gun business to establish crime empire was unconvincing. How can one become wealthy/powerful by selling gun at Rs. 1500 per unit? Why did they go in for so much trouble for so low return? I don\u2019t get it. 4) The characters are weak/unrealistic (by weak I mean black/white which doesn\u2019t work nowadays) and I don\u2019t know whom to root for except Munnabhai. 5) Pankaj Tripathi\u2019s straight faced could not develop tension in the story. Few will disagree with me here but compare him with Amrish Puri/Paresh Rawal. Both of them experiment with their looks/voices/mannerism to bring out new villainous characters in every movie. 6) The Ending was high and dry. Beena Tripathi rightly remarked, \u201cGaram kar ke chhod diya.\u201d A story should end in the same season. The next season should start with the different story but with same background. E.g. Prison Break-1 was about breaking the season and the Prison Break 2 was about treasure hunt and police chase. Barring the first fifteen minutes and few scenes of Munnabhai (Divyendu is awesome here), the series was disastrous. Few Laughable scenes: Policeman couldn\u2019t figure out blood from the colour of carpet.Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster angle was missed/underutlized here. I expected Beena Tripathi to have affair with Munna or any other powerful person leading to power games.Righteous Father is too 80s and implausible.Kulbhushan was watching the mating of animals on Discovery. For what? Weird Fantasy.Love triangle of Munna-Guddu-Sweety was too childish (neither cute nor thrilling).The problem with Mirzapur is that it was influenced by Gangs of Wasseypur. They tried to create Mirzapur in Wasseypur. The writers need to wander on the streets of Mirzapur to unearth realistic stories the way Anurag Kashyap did for Gangs of Wasseypur. If we want to compete at global level, then we need to roll up our sleeves and develop earthy engaging story, else digital may become the next TV and Indian youngsters will look for American content.

            "answer_text": "Mirzapur is a mixture of generic previously successful bollywood movies and some web series which offers nothing new that you have not seen or heard. The series has the amalgamation of Gangs of Wasseypur, Sacred Games and other heartland movies which has same repeated backdrop. Seriously the makers just presented same old things being that cuss words, sex scenes, violence, corruption, power, politics and what not. People have seen these things time and again and there is no need to feed same thing in different wrapping just because the earlier have done well does not mean that people will watch same things again and again and again. Mirzapur series has been very disappointing and while watching it you will realize that certain scenes have been taken as it is or have been modified a little from other similar stories making it not a fresh content or worth spending your time. Series has 9 episodes in season 1 each episode is about 45\u201352 minutes long. Certain episodes are very boring and you will feel very detached from the scenes that how pathetic the series is. Acting - Pankaj Tripathi is a good actor and done decent not very good but decent we have seen his similar kind of straight face acting in other movies as well the way he plays with the eyes and pauses in the film is good. Vikrant Massey has also done a good job. But he has played the obedient guy in other movies as well and this series is no different he is a good guy who has been forced to become a goon because of so called circumstances that i don\u2019t know how have been recreated in every 2 movie or series. The rest of the cast is there to do there job but no one has done nothing surprisingly brilliant to be praised or need a special mention. Story - Nothing new Mirzapur has a don called Kaleen Bhaiya played by Pankaj Tripathi, he has a son squandering money and abuses his power and ambitious, a wife who is lecherous, one right hand man, some corrupt politician, one rival don in Jaunpur, Two brothers Guddu and Bablu who become goons, two sisters who are just there because they have to play the love interest of Guddu and Bablu and the rest you can guess same old shit in the district gun, violence, corrution, sex and abuses and the series end that is all. Its your time spend it wisely !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "It was utter disappointment. Warning: Spoilers Ahead! If you don\u2019t want them, please don\u2019t read further/read once you are done with the series. Now, being an Indian web series, that too, a crime related web series, it was compared in my mind with Sacred Games. Trust me, you will also do it subconsciously. It comes nowhere near Sacred Games. Coming to what poor formulation of plot is, the writers were heavily influenced by the following: 1.Katta (Local Indian Pistol) scenario and Rivalries and Foul Mouthing : Gangs of Wasseypur  2.Over endorsement:  3.Self explanatory  Incest/Adultery was not explored this much before but, literally no permutation and combination was left in showing it. I know you want to show a sex-starved character, but this is India guys, the show might face heavy backlash with this I guess.  Another disappointing thing was wasting the caliber of this person.  A drug kingpin. How much dark he could have been made. Really they wasted this man\u2019s role. I agree kingpins are kingpins because of sharp intellect, but they are ruthless as well. Other than keeping a stern face like Marlon Brando in The Godfather and moving his neck once in a while, Pankaj Tripathi does nothing, nothing at all. His sicarios disobey direct orders and insult him before his father and other gang members, but he still does nothing. I mean what fear does he even have in his gang? Doesn\u2019t make sense. Want to see a real kingpin? Gus Fring was the best yet I saw. Ruthless.   The only thing you won\u2019t find lacking in Mirzapur is gore. Lots of it.  Hell, I was almost thinking this was a Quentin Tarantino movie with all the blood bath shown. There was no shortage of: Intestines coming out.Brains getting splattered.Necks getting slit with the most horrifying realism and spurts.Genitalia\u2019s cut off. Wicked and WTF.If slight blood makes you uneasy, you might puke also.  Summary: Characters not explored to their full potential. A sub standard crime drama with nothing out of the ordinary. A bad try at mixing all things out there into making a forced plot. (Images: Google Images/ Quora Image Search/ IMDb - Movies, TV and Celebrities / AMC studios.) ",

            "answer_text": "WOW! Let me give you the answer in a few points, but it won\u2019t spoil your show for sure.  The acting of the two brothers Babloo Pandit(Ali Fazal) and Guduu Pandit(Vikrant Massey) is so very good. The acting of Kaleen Bhaiya( Pankaj Tripathi) is marvelous too, the way he speaks everything looks just as if a goon is corrupting someone. Munna Tripathi(Divyendu Sharma) hs played most of the roles in Comedy Movies, but in this one he seems damn serious.The songs are pretty good too.The storyline is perfect, not like Sacred Games. Adult content is present in the series, which may not be suitable to every viewer, and raw words like MC/BC would come in every 4\u20135 seconds. This adult content makes the series look orignal.All in all, Mirzapur is a thoroughly exhilarating ride. With season 1 ending an episode too soon, I for one will be waiting for season 2 with bated breath.The story goes through the business of Desi Kattas, drugs, frienship and all the way to Political aspects.One thing which I don\u2019t like is the actors always look like they have came just out of the vanity van all neat, not in this series but in each and every movies in the recent times.If you have a break of 3\u20134 days just watch this out. Songs-Mirzapur- Full Audio Song Jukebox | OST Soundtrack | Amazon Prime Video For me it was better than Gangs of Wasseypur and Sacred Games. ",

            "answer_text": "MIRZAPUR SEASON 2: Characters performance  As expected, Pankaj Tripathi (Kaleen Bhaiya aka Akhandanand) and Divyendu Sharma (Munna Bhaiya/Phoolchand) have lived up to the audience expectations with their stellar performance. The transition from a na\u00efve and impulsive goon to a man who carefully plans and plots Mirzapur\u2019s takeover, Ali Fazal (Guddu Pandit) is to watch out for. One may even feel that he has adopted all the calm and sly qualities of his deceased brother. The journey of Golu\u2019s character (Shweta Tripathi) from a studious topper to an avenge-seeking gun-totter is incredible.  There are some fresh characters in Mirzapur Season 2 and a couple of them deserve a special mention. Robin (Priyanshu Painyuli) plays a financial fixer who falls in love with Guddu\u2019s sister, Dimpy (Harshita Gaur). Bharat Tyagi and Shatrughan Tyagi (Vijay Verma) plays Dadda Tyagi\u2019s twins and delivers a convincing performance. Even in scenes where both brothers are dressed identically, the audience can make out the difference between the elder and younger twin. Fab performance! Mirzapur Season 2: What\u2019s in store for fans?  The pace of Mirzapur season one is missing in season 2. Fans who are expecting to see a high-strung, violent, emotional drama just like Mirzapur Season 1 are in for a huge disappointment.2. A loosely held plot, and a predictable screenplay takes out the fizz out of the high-pitch drama that was expected in season 2.  3. The first two episodes are understandably slow, considering that the characters are still learning to cope with the wedding massacre. But till the end of 10 episodes the same pace continues. One is just waiting for it to end. 4. Audience will miss Bablu Pandit (Vikrant Massey) and Compounder\u2019s (Abhishek Banerjee)powerful performances in season 2. 5. The worst part is that the climax is predicable, and it leaves one praying that there is no season 3 that follows. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a sucker for crime thrillers especially the ones that have a desi backdrop. And what else can be better than one set in our very own UP? So Anurag Kashyap has really set the bar high with Gangs of Wasseypur and Sacred Games. All the television shows and movies that have a touch of Indian gang violence are compared to his works. When I saw Mirzapur posters all across Delhi along with Narcos: Mexico billboards, I was quite amazed. A start studded cast. People have high expectations. Amazon trying to lure the Indian audience with a brilliant marketing strategy. Minor spoilers ahead. Divyendu Sharma, whom we remember as the guy from Pyaar ka punchnama has shown a lot of versatility. He went from this  to this-  He really outperformed himself and in my opinion, is the best character in the show. Funnily, Ali Fazal\u2019s role as Guddu reminded me of Tommy Vercetti in GTA Vice City xD   Brilliant acting but it will take some time for you to adjust with his weirdness. Vikrant Massey was also great. Pankaj Tripathi is one of my favourite actors, but I think he could have had some more dialogues. Same for Kulbhushan Kharbanda who can be seen watching discovery channel throughout the series. Rasika Duggal\u2019s role becomes prominent only in the last episode and it will most probably be a game changer in the next season. Full marks for cinematography and editing. The gut wrenching graphic content that will make you feel disgusted. I think they even left game of thrones behind in that department. You will hear a gaali in every dialogue and that UP tone really brings the best out of them ;) But I feel there weren\u2019t any hard hitting dialogues that will remain etched in our mind after watching the series. The plot was weak and predictable. As if they took parts of the story from Gangs of Wasseypur and Game of thrones and combined them together which make no sense at all. Hell yeah, there\u2019s even a desi version of \u201cThe red wedding\u201d. A lot of people will tell you not to dig up for details and instead enjoy the show, but it\u2019s the small details that leave a long lasting effect on the viewer. Some parts of the story are hard to swallow. For instance, In the first episode the two brothers (Ali Fazal and Vikrant Massey) were reluctant to work for Kaleen Bhaiya, but in the second episode they are happily dancing with pistols. No feeling of remorse. Even the mother is shown to support them. And in the third last episode, Guddu blows up his boss\u2019 nemesis with a pistol in the presence of his body guards (who are armed with AK-47\u2019s). This came out of the blue and they killed off one of the main characters in a second. Overall, I enjoyed watching the show. Once you start watching it, you won\u2019t stop until you have finished watching all the episodes. I read the reviews of many acclaimed critics. They are just rubbish. It doesn\u2019t deserve so much backlash. It\u2019s not a \u201chard watch\u201d as some wrote. I will give the show a rating of 7.5/10. Eagerly waiting for season 2!  ",

            "answer_text": "Total waste of time & energy. No spice or no \u201cMIRZAPUR KA BHAUKAL\u201d.  Don't make huge expectation from season 2. Mirzapur 2 are nothing like that of Season 1 & It doesn't make justice of even 50% of viewers expectations as compared to season 1. Starting from episode 1, people start confusing what is happening there? How \u2018Munna Bhaiya' got ambushed by Guddu wheras his living existence is disclosed to Kaaleen and Munna in 3rd episode only. How Munna got 5 shot of bullets?Till last episode you will not get the answer of these questions. Unnecessary extended 5\u20136 characters like Dadda Tyagi(Dwarf character who is a don but audiences will laugh rather than feeling fear on his screen presence) and his 2 son(Vijay Verma in double role who don't know any acting but good for modelling) share \u2018zero\u2019 impact in the movie. They have been casted only to give unnecessarily plots and time extension to the series.  The sister of Guddu Bhaiya(Dimpy) and her love angle with a small investor has no connection with the story line. Movie would be much better if these character wouldn't have been used in movie. This undoubtedly diverts your mind.  Guddu pandit(Ali faisal) completely losses his passion, fire of revenge & you will truely miss his \u2018macho' avtar. He can barely walk in the whole movie. Though he has done acted superb in the movie and good in emotional scenes. Golu (Shweta Tripathi), the love interest of Guddu's dead brother Bablu (Vikrant Massey in season 1), heal and prepare Guddu for the ultimate fight. She has done justice with his acting skills and action scenes.  Divyendu Sharma comes out looking the best in a rather humanised version of his character. You can't expect much better acting. He has acted a sensible husband & disobedient son in last scenes. His wife also skillfully played a deprived wife's and a short role of Chief Minister .  The star of the both season's remains Kaaleen bhaiya(Pankaj Tripathi). He talks more with his eyes than his mouth. Kaaleen bhaiya make 100% justice with his role of Don, politician and a surrendered father. He is blessed with another new born son and another contender of Mirzapur throne. Kaaleen bhaiya doesn't die so there are chances for season 3 also.  Kaaleen Bhaiya's wife \u201cBeena\u201d is back. She is as manipulative as she was in Season 1. She knows how to play the men around her while making them believe that they are making their own decisions. She wants that the throne of mirzapur should be reserved for his own son instead of Munna Bhaiya. So she join hands with guddu bhaiya and leaks them secret information. She has a deal with Guddu. You will surely miss the character of babloo bhaiya from season 1. Finally guddu bhaiya takes the throne of Mirzapur. Other character are ok like Guddu's girl friend \u2018shabnam\u2019, SP, Guddu's parents, Sharad & doctor & his wife who save guddu's life. Sharad Shukla(Anjum Sharma) has important & long role and he impresses with his talent. He is the same guy who shove his head in season one ending. He has done a marvelous job and diplomatically acted well.  Less violence as compared to season 1. I will give it 5 out of 10. ",

            "answer_text": "My take on Mirzapur S2 (No Spoiler)  Performance to watch out for Kaaleen bhaiya, Munna, Guddu pandit,Sharad yadav, Madhuri, Beena and Golu. So here it is Mirzapur S2 after long wait, and frankly speaking it has not disappointed me at all. Season starts with a flashback of S1 and slowly enters in present where we are going to see the race for King of Mirzapur. First half of the season is quite slow paced according to me which shows viewers about how Guddu and Golu try to arrange funds and power and at the same time running for life far from Kaaleen Bhaiya and Munna. Where as Munna is thrived to become the king of Mirzapur and kaaleen bhaiya giving some sort of power to munna and also trying to enter in politics to expand business and power. Sharad yadav is new promising character to watch out for keen on taking revenge of his father's death and also trying betraye kaaleen bhaiya. Second half, show takes the pace and you will see some action between munna and guddu,as munna trying to naab guddu despite of kaaleen bhaiya warning to be quite until election gets over. Won't tell more about second half as it's really interesting to watch. Meanwhile police officer shakes hand with kaaleen bhaiya and planning for backstabbing. Slowly guddu is entering into business and losses are increasing for kaaleen bhaiya. And then things get interesting and you will see how far these all can go to become King of Mirzapur \ud83d\udc51 Show is well balanced between Male and Female dominance, good to see how well the female characters are written.

            "answer_text": " \u201cMirzapur is Amazon\u2019s answer to Netflix\u2019s Sacred Games. Set in the badlands of eastern UP, it mixes a heady cocktail of power and politics tripping on guns and drugs. If there\u2019s one overarching quality that stands out about this web series, it is the power of restraint. Seething, simmering, burning, about to spill-over restraint. Except the gore and grime of blood which is ubiquitous (in some cases unnecessary) and a part of visual calisthenics, everything is about control: controlled aggression, controlled rage and controlled retribution. Each character operates with a certain integrity and defiance in the face of odds and deserves respect. Young women, free and uninhibited, break the mould of small-town shackles and leave a deep impact. Pankaj Tripathi, steely, shifty and a master of understatement, delivers arguably the finest performance of his career so far. Ali Fazal, an absolute revelation after having beefed up for this role, plays a maverick madcap gangster living by the gun, one who simply explodes. Rasika Dugal morphs into a vessel of sexual energy and pays a heavy price. Hauntingly beautiful musical score dot all the nine episodes. Showrunner Karan Anshuman and director Gurmeet Singh need to be applauded for breaking the box. They did it and how!\u201d By Sanjay Trehan Source: Mirzapur (2018) Review: Amazon\u2019s Answer to Netflix\u2019s Sacred Games \u2013 Flickside ",

            "answer_text": "Just finished watching \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 I would say it is not disappointing as i saw many negative comments and comparison with Sacred games. Common guys, When you get the best and after that you still expects something like that should come again & again is totally unfair and unreal. Mirzapur is a complete action, highly level of violence and good storyline package. The good thing to watch \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 is their connectively with audience. Nowadays slangs being the important part to complete every Indian series. They did use it but they way they potray every character is mindblowing. If you want to watch a idiot, illiterate and muscular man to do unruly things must watch this series. Ali fazal nailed the character and work is worthwatching.  Pankaj Tripati with his calm mind in business and killer mind in ruling mirzapur is beauty.  Every characters maker shown has done a good role. With great storyline and sex stuff is shown in appropriate not like in sacred games.  Mirzapur Background make you think little bit about present on going scenario and relevance of character in time.  I think it is unfair to compare but it is worthwatching and i\u2019ll tell some reasons why to watch this series. Good storyline.Characters death is unexpected.Good Cinematography.Political matter.Character\u2019s Work.Series introduction makes you suspicious and curious to watch.Climax is Unpredictable Thankyou.

            "answer_text": "Simply Loved it..:) It actually worth 8.7/10 rating from IMDB and I think it deserves even more\u2026. Most of us have recently watched the Sacred games from Netflix, so I have seen many reviews comparing these both web series but let me tell you that Sacred games were in a totally different background than this. Sacred games were firstly in the background of Mumbai and secondly, it was based on a police investigation and rise of a gangster in a big city who is fond of money and popularity. Mirzapur is very much different than that, as it is firstly in the background of a U.P city that itself changes its cinematic aspects and secondly it is based on the story of two brothers who, unfortunately, in the pressure of circumstances joins the path of violence. So, I don\u2019t think that comparing these both is a good idea because these both carry very different and magnificent stories on their own places. Now, coming to Mirzapur. It actually worth a watch if you want to experience something good and feel a nice story with some fantastic actors. It has everything that a perfect series should have in this background\u2026. Cast: The whole cast seems like they are accurately picked for their respective roles. For example- Pankaj Tripathi as Kaleen bhaiya,  Seriously he is one of the best actors we have in the acting industry, he doesn\u2019t only speaks dialogues well but his expressions are also just killing, he has played that role so seemingly effortlessly and realistically that it doesn\u2019t look like he is acting.  Vikrant Massey as Bablu pandit, he has also acted magnificently and very well fits in the role, his dialogue delivery and expressions are worth mentioning, he is a really talented actor. Similarly, the roles of Divyendu Sharma, Ali Fazal, Shweta Tripathi, and other leading actors are very well presented. Story: It is a story that revolves around the life of two brothers who starts to work under a Don of their city. The story line up and its representation are very well filmed. It is shown in a realistic and effective way. The one thing that I liked very much was that story doesn\u2019t focus only on main leading roles but it also concentrates on other people who are attached to it, so basically it doesn\u2019t bore you over time but raises interest towards the story. They have also focused on the female actors sufficiently, the story shows status and position of women in the society and on the other hand in many scenes actresses has been shown using the gun and shooting that adds an extra taste to the story.  The writers have done a magnificent job and have built the plot of Purvanchal, U.P. very well, the culture, society and language correctly depicts the background and hence you will get to hear that hard and abusive words so often in the story but they don't seem unnecessary, in fact, that language suits on the characters and brings comedy and fun listening them. There is so much of blood shown as well in the story as it is the story consisting of Don and rivals, so it might make you uneasy if you are scared of blood and all that. It consists of all the terms that a good series should have, action, comedy, love story, emotional scenes, suspense, adult content and passion all are well shown in the series. It has many factors that make it interesting, like the story lineup which is attracting and realistic, acting which is really awesome, dialogues, and messages that this story conveys on many places. The story has many interesting parts that create thrill and do not have any unneeded instant turning points, which makes it look practical. The climax is emotional and creates a thirst for next season. So, basically, it perfectly gives you the thing for which you watch any web series rather than any random boring T.V. serial, the realistic and thrilling entertainment. If you liked Gangs of Wasseypur then you are definitely going to love it as it is based on the same background (U.P/Bihar), similar story lineup and consist of similarly good and talented actors.  Overall, the series is appreciable and direction is successful to give the audience the feel of the story. It is nicely presented with a few mistakes that can be ignored in front of such a magnificent story and fantastic acting. Image Source: Google ",

            "answer_text": "Too Many critics out here. It\u2019s a democracy- each one of us has the right to express their own. So, bear with me. Considering there is no big production house involved and scale of the series is not big either- the work is commendable.The plot is simple, converges to the real-life characters to an extent. The dialogue deliveries are native and diligently adapted.The series sometimes seems an incest baby of \u201cHaasil\u201d, \u201cGangs of Wasseypur\u201d \u201cShaheb bibi and Ganster\u201d and few more but again, it all boils down to the screenplay when you don\u2019t have that newness in the storyline, which casts have handled really well.Characters Pankaj Tripathi as Kaleen Bhaiya played a tough character with so much ease. He gives the life hacks through the series. The character of Bina Tripathi played by Rasika Duggal asks many questions, which a society, where women talking of sex is considered profanity will find outrageous. Those fiery eyes, hunger of orgasm, desire to embibe the seed of fertility stirs the essence. Ali Fazal playing Guddu Pandit is spontaneous. Life is so simple for him. He never is confused as what to do and what not to \u2026 rather say, he always lives in the moment. Those dates of samosa and pattis, the kid waiting the table and the way he serves the tea- Awesomeness. Divyendu Sharma as Munna Tripathi could have been better.Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Discovery shows, he watches in the movie fits in.There are other characters too but I leave it upto you to explore. Appreciate these 5 scenes in the movie: Kaleen Bhaiya doing Bina and while she tries to get on the top- Kaleen bhaiya pushing her down saying beneath men is the fate a lady is destined to be.Golu Gupta reading the Masochistic literature and deriving the pleasure from it.The date setting of a small town- meeting on the aalo pattis date- that angry kid waiterThe dialogues exchanged between Kaleen Bhaiya and Guddu when they meet after the later has thrashed Munna.The last scene, where Kaleen bhaiya explains the difference of when he tendered as a businessman vs when he responds as a don.Image Source: Meet the ensemble cast of Mirzapur web series - official posters inside | Bollywood News ",

            "answer_text": "Well, Mirzapur is worth a watch. Amazon prime video has been successful in bringing out a show which deals with different aspects of life,(although bestowing on the audience to understand the deeper meaning behind those scenes) It revolves around the story of two brothers who, as a result of unavoidable circumstances, start to work for a businessman don in the town of Mirzapur. This leads them to a whole new plot of experiences which ultimately impose a deep impact on their lives as their families\u2019. The series has many characters who are presented in a subtle yet economical way. The dominating behaviour of men in the Indian society( special reference to rural India), the desire of the women to experience their sexuality at their own will have been brought forward through the 9-episodic Prime series of each approximately 1 hour duration.  The actors have done their best in bringing out the characters to life. People like Pankaj Tripathi, Vikrant Massey, Ali Fazal, Shreya Pilgaonkar, Divyendu Sharma, Shweta Tripathi, Rasika Duggal have done their(usual) rocking performance. With such an amazing ensemble cast with youth and experience, Mirzapur is ought to serve a huge audience to a great extent.  While, the VFX is good enough to show all the bloodshed with intestines coming out, blown up brains and many other things to incite horror and scare in the minds of the light hearted, it is advisable for the audience to get themselves assured of being able to see through all the gruesome activities shown in the series. Nonetheless, one should watch Mirzapur, because very few series are made in India, trying to focus on the reality of the aspect they try to focus,Many series rather beat round the bush throughout the whole plot. Mirzazpur doesnot really belong to the latter. ! Cheers ! Upvotes will make me write more( because i need to write) ",

            "answer_text": "One word review \u201cWatchable' SYNOPSIS Mirzapur is an Indian crime thriller web television series. This show reveals the black market and mafia roll in UP governmental system. It especially focused on the Purvanchal Mafia system highlighted in some districts such as JaunPur, GhaziPur, Gorakhpur, Banaras, Azamgarh etc.   THE WHIP HANDS The story was well formulated. The rise of two common middle classes people to become the most powerful people in the town was well portrayed.The cast was awesome. Every single person was a proficient actor.Guddu and Bablu had done a phenomenal job. One could relate with them as the series progressed. Supporting cast like Ramakant, Maqbool, Sweety, and Golu did a fantastic job as well.The one who stood out among all would definitely be Divyensh Sharma. The boy who started with comedy movies like PKP turned out to be one of the most ruthless characters in the Mirzapur.Munna Bhaiya was the best thing that happened to Mirzapur, the series.Female characters were not just plot accelerators, they had their own importance in the series. Unlike, Bollywood movies they were provided their own limelight.THE STUMBLING BLOCKS Pankaj Tripathi, the name is enough. We all know his prowess. But according to me, his character wasn't well written. No doubt, he did his part well but we would have loved to see more. The great actor that he is was underutilized.The past arc (flashback of Kaalen Bhaiya and Rati Shankar) This section didn't seem natural. I hated the way the actors enacted those parts. It seemed that some random Bollywood footage was attached to the series with great actors.Strong characters like Rati Shankar and Maurya were never allowed to flag their position in the first place.The use of abusive language seemed to be forced at times. The natural feel we get when Kashyap uses them couldn't be felt in Mirzapur.NOTABLE SCENES When the Pandit family bash Munna and his Goons in their house.The part where Kaalen Bhaiya confronts both the brothers and offers them a job.When the Pandit brothers being the perfect amalgamation of brain and brawn increase the business of guns.The part where Munna has to kill his best friend.When Guddu kills Rati Shankar (The scene was totally unexpected and disappointing to some extent but it was pretty badass)The Lal wedding (Yeah, folks we have our own now. The desi version!)The final scene where Kaaleen Bhaiya tells Maurya who he is.The cliffhangerBonus: The hotel scenes where the badass kid is involved.  FINAL VERDICT The series is synonymous to gore content, abusive language and a lot of profane scenes. If you want to compare it with Sacred Games (which I feel you shouldn't) It could be considered as a low budget beta version. The plot coupled with the cast made it what it is today. Nothing can be perfect, Mirzapur has its own flaws. But if it keeps you glued to binge watch till the end then it certainly has succeeded in its maneuver. The best thing about it is, there is more to come. Yes, it will return with a second season. The cliffhanger is damn intriguing as well. I would rate the series 5+2/10 2 especially for Divyensh Sharma's acting.   Image source: Redirect Notice, Redirect Notice \u201cArigatou\u201d ",

I mean we get it nowdays series are generally focusing on sex,crime,gaalian,gaand etc but Limit and using tastefully is what have defined GOT ,and others. First of all katta's are all required nowdays to build empire? And there's not a single people believing judicial system kids women all have their own firearms. It's poorly copied like wasseypur but everything in those movies clicked where they needed to, in mirzapur It doesn't matter if there's story, script or acting but gaalian to chahiye boss. Pankaj tripathi is a great actor but I really didn't get any vibe of him being a dangerous let alone don of that area,and the acting of cast is like seeing any B grade movie . ",

            "answer_text": "My take on Mirzapur : Season 1 (Amazon Prime Video) : It's quite good and not \"shit\" as some wannabes say. But it's nothin' new. Same old Bihar/UP local gangster & gang war stories like we saw in GOW, though it's not even close to GOW in storyline & overall package. The violence scenes are just over-pushed, with unnecessary bloodshed & bossiness but that's probably just the reality. But the enormous amount of bloodshed & gore scenes may sometimes make a light-hearted person skip a heartbeat. The first 4 episodes are just okay and in a steady flow. It's not at all borin' but as it doesn't feel nothin' new, so it feels like a bit monotonous. The real engagement starts from the episode 5 & after that, it's solid. The endin', though, is weird but good, if not the most perfect. Overall, it's a very good series & the season 2 is highly expected, with the still untied ends with the vague climaxes of some characters. And about comparison with Sacred Games, I must say that Sacred Games in in a totally different league altogether. Mirzapur is very good but it doesn't match the greatness of Sacred Games, not to mention the excellence of the cult, Gangs Of Wasseypur. My ratin' : 8/10 ",

            "answer_text": "A Series with the list of Underrated actors BUT with the world of Terror! Mirzapur is the most successful and loved series because of the kind of world created by the makers. It has created a different fanbase for itself. But is it good to create such a Raw, Fearful world for the sake of entertainment where 55% ( Indian audience) of the audience prefers content of OTT platforms ? Right from the first episode, within the 10 minutes you will get an idea about the dark world of Mirzapur. A place where somebody's life is treated as a joke, where people are killed unnecessarily. You never know who's next. Unpredictable, full of Raw and Violence scenes, with the amazing performances by Actors. 3 reasons Mirzapur worked well :- 1) The Marketing Strategy - The makers, creatives promoted it so well and created a buzz for their content. A well written and planned series so that whoever starts watching, ends up Binge watching Whole season. 2) The Boldness - When we talk about boldness, it's not always about the scenes or abusive words/slangs said by the actors. It's about thinking, writing, acting and expressing. Those who haven't watched the series, you will understand this in the climax sequence, don't want to spoil it. 3) Actors and Performances - Watching such superb performances by all the Actors makes us realize that how underrated these actors are and Bollywood has Talent, but they don't utilise. Every Actor in the series leaves their own individual mark, no matter whether the role is small or big. Real Story or Fictional :- While asking for the same to Ali Fazal, an article says that, \"No it is not based on a real life story or to a particular person but it has got inspired by some Incidents and Facts. We came across and heard about many Stories and Legends. In one of our a trip, we met a this wannabe body-builder. We were taken aback by the efforts and commitment they make to win a Local Competition. We also researched for Drug trade but the world is so fictionalized and dramatized, we let our imagination Wild.\" So the creators and Writing team have done a good amount of research before making this Violent Thriller. No Personal Grudges or Objection, but one should keep in mind while making something that it influences large amount of people. Anyone who is searching for dark thriller, watch it. The series is not for Soft-hearted people. Would you be able to live at a place like this? Have you watched the Season 1, if Yes, How excited are you for Season 2? ",

I can totally imagine one of the writers or someone from the creative team of the show going _\u201cAgar ek nymphomaniac aurat ko husband chod ke apne bete aur sasur ke saath bhi sex karte huye dikhaye to kaisa rahega?\u201d and the others concurring with \u201cha bohot hard and edgy, this is unexplored territory\u201d._ If we were to talk about the story, it simply doesn\u2019t add up. The characters are unrealistic too. I could sit for hours and break down every character and tell how and why it\u2019s ridiculous, but anyone with an ounce of sense knows this already. The worst episode has to be the finale, terrible acting, overload of shockvalue (to compensate for poor script perhaps?); seriously, a father in law after raping his daughter in law forces her to give a handjob to their servant by holding her at a gun point while he watches\u2026what kind of depravity is that? How does it add to the script? What point are the creators trying to make? In what world does this happen? Sure, UP, Bihar, or Bimaru in general is like a post apocalyptic dystopia, but even for the said states this is just too unreal. There is just too many plotholes and unrealistic characters to take the show seriously. ",

            "answer_text": "MIRZAPUR (AMAZON PRIME SERIES): If SACRED GAMES was the start, MIRZAPUR is the sprint. It takes off your breath as it makes you feel the fear and uncertainity that is way of life in a small town engulfed in power struggle between the incumbent Bahubali of the small town, two ambitious brothers who want to break the class barriers to rise from lower middle class to upper, and a helpless police that's still figuring out how to gain the control over the city. Mirzapur contains extreme ghory violence with blood splattering like water, but it also brings forth certain immoral shades of today's society that without introspection prides itself on its aesthetic culture. At first it seems as if it's just another Gangs of Wasseypur, but those assumptions get soon belied. The story and screenplay provide lifeline to Mirzapur and give it a strong base. There are certain glimpses of the characters from Arvind Adiga's Booker Award Winning 'The White Tiger' that doesnt shy away from talking bluntly about the other half of India that is also known as bharat . Among actors, Pankaj Tripathi looks stunning in his character. His subtle gestures and eye movements showcase his class as a cold blooded goon. Divyendu Sharma (Popularly know as Liquid after Pyaar Ka Punchnama) as a spoilt brat of rich family brings a complete change to his image and by the time season one ends, you really hate Munna for his mad insensible utterly self indulging character. Ali Afzal, as Guddu Pandit brings in the much needed situational humour through his adroitly played character of an ambitious body builder who gets attracted towards game of power. Although a goon, he charms the audience with his innocent heart. Vikrant Massey, as his sharp minded brother who wanted to be an IAS officer but gets dragged into the dirty game, charms you with his persona and gives you a reason to wait for season two. The entire support cast is fantastic, from the guy who teaches Munna how to slit a throat to the old cunning man in the bungalow who silently witnesses everything going around only to stun you at the right time, from carefree yet brave Sweety to studious yet fragile Golu Gupta. The background music is superb and creates an absolute tension that would make your heart pump and beat fast as you keep speculating with your eyes glued to the screenplay. Cinematography and Direction are world class. If you don't believe me, watch it from Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar who are the executive producers for the series. A must watch MIRZAPUR is but ironically I would not recommend it for everyone as it may give you some psycho. If you decide to, watch carefully at your own risk. RATING 4/5. ",

Spoilers Ahead Though after watching First episode i thought its a rehash of wasseypur and it looked predictable but as i saw subsequent episodes it took a big leap from wasseypur from every angle from abuses to voilence to sex. Most intriguing thing is that nobody has morality except Father of boys ( although he is also voilent) and goodness does not exist and nobody is afraid of pulling a trigger.But who cares at the end everybody is enjoying ,hurling abuses and killing like its PUBG. Some of the dialogues are genious and some character development is quite authentic like the IPS officer Maurya ,his antics and mannerism quite close as i have some first hand experinces with these officers. Technically the show is also good with wide shot of UP cities and the background score is top notch. Specially the opening credit sequence is superbly made at par with western shows. Acting wise everybody is good and apt , especially Ali fazal who really tries something new after always playing urban middle class boy. He has build impressive physique and he gets the accent and attitude point on. But my favourite is Divyendu sharma's Munna tripathi who lits the screen everytine he is on and especially in the last episode he is too good and the way he abuses is fantastic. PS : For the makers IAS ki coaching Allahabad me hoti hai ,Lucknow me bas park hain. Apologies for any mistakes. ",

It\u2019s a show made for adult audiences, and that too for people who are mature and can take the violence that the show gives on to you. Many people don't like the show because of this, and think that Sacred Games is better than Mirzapur, BUT IT IS NOT. I\u2019ve talked about this in great detail in this video review I\u2019ve made, I\u2019d advice you to go through it, it\u2019ll be of interest and would answer all your questions about Mirzapur.  It\u2019s a short and sweet review, and I would love to hear your comments to on whether you agree with me or not. Hope you like it and thanks for reading and watching. Cheers! ",
