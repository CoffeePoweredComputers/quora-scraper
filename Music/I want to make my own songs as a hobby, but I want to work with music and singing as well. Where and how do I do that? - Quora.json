            "answer_text": "I am not the one to ask as I was never a successful singer songwriter! I did write and perform a few hundred songs though. Do you seek success or just want an audience or is it simp,y for your own pleasure? Writing is the hard bit. It helps if you play an instrument or can sing with someone who does. Write about what you know. Try not to copy. Try it out on friends, then your local folk club or open mic night. Then support others for free or for costs until you get real gigs. Or go the YouTube route if you want to be a sensation. Number one for me is having something to say. Number two is writing a catchy tune. Number three is practice. Number four is having the guts to do it in front of people. Good luck! ",
