            "answer_text": "I have to start off by pointing out the flaw in your question. You are starting a business by partnering with a company. If you have done your due diligence; asking the hard questions, understanding the consumption models, and using the product, then you are ready to look at the compensation plan.My recommendation is to look at the comp plan and understand the behaviors that the plan creates. This will give you an indication about the culture is of the company. After that I recommend looking at and asking to meet the leadership of the company.It doesn't matter if you are investing $15 or $2000, you need to know that what you are promoting has a sustainable plan for customer acquisition, long term growth, and a culture of developing leaders through training and promotion.
