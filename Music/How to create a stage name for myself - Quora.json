            "answer_text": "It depends to some extent on what precisely you want to be known as. I think a good name for a magician would be different from a comedian vs. a dramatic actor vs. character roles. I see these characteristics in stage names: Often, they are \u201clike\u201d or \u201creminiscent\u201d of someone already famous. If you wanted to be a magician, for instance, it could be a different spelling of \u201cHoudini\u201d like \u201cWhodini\u201d the names \u201cBarrymore\u201d or \u201cFonda\u201d or \u201cDouglas\u201d are associated with a number of excellent actors. You can also do a variant of those. Typically, stage names are unusual in some way to draw attention and make the reader do a double take. So, rather than \u201cJohn Charles Thomas\u201d, a better stage name might be \u201cJohn Charl Thomas\u201d or \u201cJ.Charles-Thomas\u201d If you have a favorite character from fiction, you might pick that, possibly making a slight variation. If you enjoy brainstorming with friends, you might get together and spend 3\u20134 hours on it. In my experience, even after the collective brainstorming is over, all the participants keep coming up with good ideas for the next couple days so be sure to ask again. I chose \u201ctruthtable\u201d as a pen name I often use because a \u201ctruthtable\u201d is a fundamental formalism underlying computer science. My dad taught me about it when I was quite young so it also has a personal significance. It also means a place where people can work together (a table) to jointly develop the truth. Finally, it also refers to the idea of \u201ctabling\u201d the truth for a time in order to build a fictional world. I also have a blog with the name \u201cPeterSIronwood\u201d which I chose partly for the initials PSI which stand for \u201cpsychology\u201d and also for my consulting practice, \u201cProblem Solving International.\u201d I like golf, so it is partly from \u201cIron\u201d and \u201cwood\u201d as well as \u201cironwood\u201d which is a really cool looking tree trunk. Be careful of \u201cunintended side-effects\u201d before making a final commitment however. It turns out that many \u201cspell checkers\u201d automatically turn \u201ctruthtable\u201d into \u201ctduthtable\u201d which, so far as I know, means absolutely nothing so I have no idea why they do that! But it turns out to be an inconvenience. I wanted to name my consulting practice \u201c!ProblemSolvingInternational\u201d partly because in an alphabetical listing anything with a leading \u201c!\u201d should come first. However, many computer systems do not \u201callow\u201d a \u201c!\u201d in the name so that was a fail. Be sure to let us know what you decide on so that we can when you\u2019re famous!

            "answer_text": "I don't think there are any rules in creating a stage name but I like how Iggy Azalea got her stage name. What she did was combining the name of the street where she lives and her dog name. That happens to be how many porn stars got their name but, who cares right? As long as it catchy and unique enough for people to remember you. What really matters is your determination and perseverance. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Try not to think of it as a name... You could just sit around all day trying to think up names. But try this. Instead of thinking of names, try thinking of random words, like I even think Pseudonym is a cool name. Or you could come up with a whole lot of words, and try them out together. Or you could even ask some friends, and see what they think, and then mix up their ideas. Any of these might help. Have fun! ",
