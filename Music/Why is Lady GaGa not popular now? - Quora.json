            "answer_text": "Honestly, it all comes down to timing, luck, and her own career choices.  Though she might not be as popular as she was at her peak, she still has a very rabid and strong fan base - one who will likely never leave her no matter what. Though I don\u2019t consider myself a Little Monster, I do consider myself a fairly passionate fan. Not every star appropriately ages their career with time. Some of it is pure luck. In Gaga\u2019s case, her pinnacle was 2011\u2019s Born This Way. It was a phenomenal CD, one which really captured everything that Gaga was and could be - not only that, but it resonated with people as a whole, because it contained empowering themes and catchy tunes that drew in both the casual and the ardent.  It merged \u201cFame\u201d Gaga with purpose and vision, and ultimately, at least, in my opinion, it was her peak in popularity. But here is the thing about popularity - it only lasts so long as you keep yourself fresh. Gaga had been able to use very provocative and controversial images to associate herself with for a very long time. At first, these images and outfits shocked and amazed casual audiences - in fact, casual audiences embraced and lauded them - or, in some cases hated them - either way, they generated lots of buzz for her, as well as her work. The issue came when she not only suffered a terrible injury in 2013 (the cause being stressed, being overworked and poor diet) but she shifted her image to something else - full on glamour and debauchery. It was a full on embrace of the \u201cGaga\u201d character, and it left all of the Stephanie Germanotta. This shift in image is known as the ARTPOP era. Gaga fully embraced her character, and in doing so she really let go of many of the themes that caused her to peak. She let go of empowerment as a focus, she decreased her focus musically on the downtrodden or forgotten.  (As an aside, she is an amazingly thoughtful person and she always thinks of these groups I believe, but they were not part a primary part of this era like BTW or even Fame) She focused fully on merging Art and Pop together, and in the process she ended up making shallower music as a whole. I personally loved ARTPOP as a CD because I could understand the concept and I liked her ambition, but as a pure matter of fact - it just didn\u2019t possess the same amount of catchy tunes Fame had, or the depth and pride of BTW. It was just Gaga the character, without Stephanie included. But you know - like I said, Gaga is loved by millions, myself included. ARTPOP could have been an amazing era, but not only was she dealing with an injury, stress, and her mental health declining, she also let go of a lot of close managers and friends over this time. She had varying disagreements with her label, photographers and directors. Also, casual audiences had begun to tire of the over the top gimmicks and stunts. Some of which included public vomiting and photo shoots out in the middle of nature. So ARTPOP did fairly well with Little Monsters and other pop fans like myself, but it didn\u2019t really play well to the regular person who hears the radio. Plus, after seeing her for so many times over the past few years, the public became overexposed to her and over-saturated with her. After this, Gaga took a break. She decided that she wanted to re-embrace another side of herself - IMO her best self. Stephanie Germanotta the auteur and musician. The little girl on a piano. She did work with Tony Bennett, toning down gimmicks and focusing her voice. She began to reconnect with close people in her circle and family. She reevaluated her engagement and love life. Afterwards, she blossomed into the JOANNE era. This is an era that is focused on music and being true to self. It loops back in the pride, the little person, the forgotten weirdo. It embraces it in a way that ARTPOP simply did not - but not only does it do that, it appeals to the radio. Not through bombast and glamour, but through subtle and heartfelt connection intelligently mixed with a catchy beat. Perfect Illusion is a great example. She speaks about her love life, throws catchiness into it, and uses her musicality, not her image, to propel the single forward. So is Stephanie Germanotta unpopular? I\u2019d say not. She\u2019s focused on being a musician, tapping into and taking care of her personal matters - being true to herself, her fans, and what she began with before glory and glamour. Music.  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that Lady Gaga IS popular now, as the ticket sales for her Las Vegas residency, \u201cEnigma\u201d, has proven. I also believe that Gaga's casual fans, or the fans that embraced her over-the-top fashions and outrageous antics, have moved on. And what is left are the diehard Little Monsters that would follow Gaga anywhere. Gaga also has a brand new wave of fans that have embraced her, more girl-next-door image and those drawn to the artist and actress also known as Stefani Germanotta. After almost a decade, Lady Gaga has finally allowed herself to be Stefani and to let the world see that. Between the release of Artpop and Joanne, Gaga went through a lot of changes. And with the release of Joanne, emerged as an older, more refined and confident Lady Gaga. She was finally confident enough in herself to let the walls around her fall away and allow the world to see that she indeed had a vulnerable side, a side that loved and lost, that felt pain and sorrow, that went through the same trials and tribulations of life just like everyone else. It's almost like she was finally free of the impossible expectations she had put on herself. Of course Gaga will always go above and beyond in everything she does, that's just Gaga. She's not still at the top of her game after a decade because she rests on her laurels. She constantly pushes herself, her performances and her music. She will never just sit idly by. She will continue to evolve and create and therefore will always have a huge following. People love Gaga for a lot of reasons. But I think the main reason why people become diehard fans is because Lady Gaga is genuine. She's not perfect, but she has a diamond heart and that resonates through her, her fans and her music. Those that love her, will always love her which means that she will always have a following, no matter what comes next. ",
