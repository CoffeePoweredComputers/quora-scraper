So something like Cruise by Florida Georgia Line? Reached 75 in the UK top 100. And that\u2019s in the digital download age where having to go and buy a physical copy of a record is less common. The song was available to anyone with a net connection and a credit card. Cruise (song) - Wikipedia Then there\u2019s those songs that get some people instantly singing along, and are highly recognisable: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_in_the_Wind Piano Man (song) - Wikipedia Free Bird - Wikipedia Let's Get It On (song) - Wikipedia Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song) - Wikipedia Baby Got Back - Wikipedia Nope, not a top ten amongst them.

Neil Tennant has referred to the song as a band favourite, and it\u2019s one of mine as well. Many years ago, I summoned the courage to make a second attempt to ask out a girl I worked with, only to receive the dreaded \u201cI don\u2019t see you that way, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d I apologized, and agreed that we had little in common. It was true, but I was still smitten. As I drove away, the local FM station played the very song\u2026 it still resonates with me. Love Comes Quickly - 2001 Remaster ",
