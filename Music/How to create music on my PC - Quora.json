            "answer_text": "Creating your own music is a lot of fun and something I did and still do as a hobby and wish that I could do more professionally, now that I am good at it! So lets get started! I am assuming by the way you asked your question that you are a beginner. If you read online people will recommend Fruity Loops however it is a tougher program which deals with just making beats. First step is getting a general feel for creating music on a computer. Download these software: (1) If you have a Apple Computer: GarageBandGarageBand on the Mac App Store(2) If you have an PC Computer: Acoustia MixcraftDownload Mixcraft 8 | Recording Software | Acoustica How to Use:Garage Band, should still come free with Apple. Acoustia Mixcraft is available for Both. GarageBand and Mixcraft work the same way. They are cool because they have a host of different beats, instruments, sound effects, transition effects, bass, dubs, and other cool interesting sounds. You will have multiple rows known as \u201clayers\u201d where you can put together these sounds at the same time, switching between, or combining layers of sounds to create something amazing.  For Example:Layer 1 = DrumsLayer 2 = High Hat And then you will listen to them together until you have a complete song with all the layers of sounds and instruments you would like. Then play the song and readjust until it sounds perfect to you. Attention: It WILL take time before you are able to actually \u201clike\u201d what you hear. But it is SUCH A REWARDING FEELING! TRUST ME! Cheers, ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what type of music you\u2019re trying to make. To keep this answer simple i\u2019ll give you a few suggestions. 1. Get a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) Fl Studio (easy to use and learn (from experience))Ableton (takes time to learn but after that it should be easy to use (from experience))Logic Pro (I\u2019ve never used it but I have heard good things)Garageband (easy to use and learn but has less functionality than FL Studio (from experience))Plenty more!!!2. Get drumkits 3. Get closed & open backed headphones 4. Get a decent condenser microphone with a preamp (I\u2019d recommend the Scarlett) 5. Have a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM (you\u2019ll thank me later) ",

Or do you mean to \u201cplay\u201d music as in play an instrument. Or \u201ccompose\u201d music? Do you want do do things at a very low level with computer generated music. Do you want to created printed music? You really need to be much more specific with your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an expert in this field, but my advice for you is to try the free version of Fruity Loops, and follow tutorials on Youtube. If you want to take the easy way, you can try the Music Maker Jam app, you can download it on the windows store ( needs win 10). Try different softwares, search for other ones, practice, and that\u2019s how you\u2019ll have a great level in it ",
