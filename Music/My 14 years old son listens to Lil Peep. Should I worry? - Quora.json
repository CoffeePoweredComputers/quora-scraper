            "answer_text": "No, you shouldn't be worried at all. I'm 17 years old and been listening to Lil Peep since I was 15. Old ass people are going to answer with a big fat, \u201cYES\u201d but you should let your child listen to the music he likes and let him have the freedom to express the music he/she likes. If you restrict him/her from doing so it's just going to make your child despise you. Lil Peep wrote songs on his depression and things that he was going through and suffering. His music helps a lot of people are going through depression or similar situations that Peep was in. I talk with Lil Peep's mother and Gus was an amazing person and an amazing Artist. He was the Kurt Cobain of this era. If your child is doing self-harm then I advise seeking medical attention. Lil Peep's music as nothing to do with your child hurting themselves. They maybe going through their own problems which resulted in them cutting. ",
