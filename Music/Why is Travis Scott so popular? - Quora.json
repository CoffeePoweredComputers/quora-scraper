            "answer_text": "Based on.the latest revenue results list in.hits daily double he is only about 3.6 k sales. his song \u201c sicko mode\u201d is slipping down the charts, so he is not as popular as he might been before. He still on the chart and.streaming. I do not think he is all.that popular now. i would have to look into Wikipedia or google him to find out how popular he was before, i think he was popular because people liked his style of singing and rapping. i do not like him ,so i would hope somebody who did could give you a better answer than just how he is doing on i-tunes and spotify , if interested further look into the sites about him, ",
