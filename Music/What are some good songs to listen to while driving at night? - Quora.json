            "answer_text": "When I'm just driving at night, it really all depends on what mood I'm in... Some examples: Composers like Hans Zimmer    or Jon Brion    Psychedelic Rock; The Mars Volta    Hard Rock/Metal; Metallica    Or if I'm feeling nostalgic; Boston    Really it doesn't just end there. These are only examples I can think of off the top of my head. It all really depends on your mood and the kind of music you like. But that doesn't mean you should be afraid to explore or to try new things. ",
