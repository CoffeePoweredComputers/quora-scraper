            "answer_text": "jyoshi (\u5973\u5b50) can mean women in general, so there is nothing wrong with using the word for adults, in theory. In practice, it is more fitting for young women because of what the second character ko (\u5b50) implies. The usage of the term for adults (say those in 30s and above), however, has become more wide-spread in recent years. According to a random Internet poll, the majority appears to think it is not fitting for, say, those above 20s. \u30c7\u30a4\u30ea\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1 - \u5973\u5b50\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8a00\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3075\u3055\u308f\u3057\u3044\u5e74\u4ee3\u306f\u3044\u3064\u307e\u3067\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f - \u30a2\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30c8\u56de\u7b54\u30da\u30fc\u30b8   Note that this poll does not seem scientific at all and therefore may be garbage, just as most other \"statistics\" reported in the popular media are.... but discussions around the usage of the term sometimes occur in other venues, and they often point out how awkward it is to use the term jyoshi for those who do not really exude youth any more. To me, the term has seen a wider usage to refer to adult women because of how youth-oriented the culture in Japan is, and people's desire to remain youthful. And it is a useful word for the media to use for that purpose -- to implicate that you are still young. And it is true to some extent that many adults (in developed nations at least) do not \"grow up\" as fast as they used to be. They have more freedom in life style -- work, delay marriage and reproduction, etc. Heck, I myself still live like a student most of the time and have a mindset of 13 year old... though my appearance has diminished accordingly to age. Also, one of the biggest transition you as an adult faces in Japan is how you are called by a stranger who does not know your name. When people call you ojisan (\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093) or obasan (\u304a\u3070\u3055\u3093), instead of oniisan (\u304a\u5144\u3055\u3093) or onesan (\u304a\u59c9\u3055\u3093), for example, that signals that you indeed \"appear\" old, not due to age and mental maturity alone. That can be shocking to some, as other signs of aging are. Although faking age appropriateness is silly, I have to admit that certain aspects of my mind and sensibility haven't changed much at all since when I was younger. So I feel that I actually understand why a term like jyoshi has seen wider use. But that doesn't remove awkwardness, and hence the question like this is relevant. ",
