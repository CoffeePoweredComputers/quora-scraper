            "answer_text": "No. They kissed each other on stage only to scare off homophobic idiots. And to show their support with gays. Rammstein always love to provoke, and this time they not only could provoke and enrage backwater homophobic Russian politicians, but at the same time show their support for a liberal society, and gays and the lgbt+ society. Russia is quite restrictive and extremely conservative on that issue, up to a degree where they violate human rights.  It\u2019s even more delicate since Rammstein always was disputable and seen as the bad guys. Tough man\u2026 By the way:  True love knows no age and politics. Just look at these two horny old gays! And back when they kissed, a huge crowd watched! So, when Brezhnev and Honecker loved each other and showed this in public: What\u2019s wrong when tow members of a German metal band love each other too? ",
