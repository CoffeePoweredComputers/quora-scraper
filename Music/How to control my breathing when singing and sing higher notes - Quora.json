            "answer_text": "I have 3 males working on this at the moment ,in a class of 3 tenors.1 a spinto 1 dramatic and 1 lyric.This is how I am teaching them,though it is face to face\u2026Start in a comfortable middle register,breath in through the nose a long steady breath,hold for a count of five ,then release a STEADY stream of air no pushing no kangaroo jumps,until you have exhaled all the air then rest.The same again only this time on release ..whooooooooo,making sure the release is controlled,steady beautifully .When you are correct at that part of the exercise,it feels free no dropping to the larynx .The next is repeat the first as above but after you have inhaled through the nose take a short intake through the mouth to expand the lungs sideways as it should be.for expansion building ,you need to feel that expansion all the way around the lower back\u2026.Remember we are are working towards the end product of pure high notes on full voice with no squeezing\u2026Get this going,building on extra air intake as you progress..we can,t afford mistakes,When you are happy with your ability we will then go on to support and full control of voice.The journey of 1000 miles starts with the first step\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "As you ascend higher in your range, it\u2019s crucial to hold back your breath, since releasing too much air will blow your vocal cords apart, and also dry them out, neither of which you want to happen. You must still maintain diaphragmatic support, but be sure to regulate/manage, the release of your breath as you go higher. ",
