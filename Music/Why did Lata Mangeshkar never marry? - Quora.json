            "answer_text": "There are two tracks in popular culture explaining why lata Mangeshkar didn't marry.  1. When Lata was 13 years old (year 1942), her father Shri Dinanath Mangeshkar died of heart ailment. Responsibility to take care of her four younger siblings (Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath) and her  mother fell on the young shoulders of Lata Mangeshkar. She took her responsibilities seriously and became the sole bread winner for the family by singing and acting in Sangeet Naatak (Musical Plays) and films. Time passed, her siblings grew but she never got free of family's responsibilities to consider marriage.  2.The second reason is not factually verified and references are limited only to film gossip magazines of 50's and 60's. Lata Mangeshkar and Music Director C. Ramchandra (also known as Chitalkar) fell in love with each other. The duo had a fruitful and long working association. It is most famous for the song \"Ae mere watan ke logon\" (Composed by C Ramachandra, sung by Lata Mangeshkar, penned by kavi Pradeep). C Ramchandra also sang many songs with Lata mangeshkar, notably \"Shola jo bhadke, dil mera dhadke\" from film Albela. Due to some differences and circumstances (mainly their age difference of 11.5 years, C Ramachandra was born in Jan 1918 whereas Lata Mangeshkar was born in Sept 1929), they couldn't marry. After this incident, Lata mangeshkar remained unmarried for life. ",

            "answer_text": "Source/Link: Lata Mangeshkar had an affair with Bhupen: Hazarika\u2019s estranged wife Mumbai: In what sounds like a startling statement, late legendary musician-filmmaker Bhupen Hazarika\u2019s wife has for the first time spoken about her husband\u2019s \u201caffair\u201d with melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Priyamvada Patel, estranged wife of Hazarika, who was in Assam to attend his first death anniversary revealed about the maestro\u2019s relationship with Mangeshkar while giving an interview to an Assamese channel recently. Her allegation has not only irked the Mangeshkars but has also offended Kalpana Lajmi, Hararika\u2019s companion for over 40 years. Priyamvada held Lata\u2019s equation with Hazarika as one of the reasons why she chose to get separated from her husband in 1963 after 13 years of marriage. Patel said that Lata used to visit their Kolkata residence whenever she used to be in the city. a\u201cShe used to come and they used to be together the whole night in one of the three bedrooms. She was crazy about him. He told me one day, \u2018Look Priyam, in India, if a musician wants to come up, his songs have to be sung by Lata Mangeshkar\u2019,\u201d DNA quoted Priyamvada as saying. \u201cLater, when I asked him why he should be with a woman in the room the whole night, he said \u2018ketiaba koribo lage\u2019 (sometimes you have to do it).Once, musicians Kalyanji-Anandji were in one of the rooms. Kalyanji told me in Gujarati, \u2018Behen, tame sui jao (sister you go to sleep), he won\u2019t come up\u2019,\u201d Patel reportedly said. Apparently many people in Assam had known about the presence of a \u2018big star from Bombay\u2019 in Hazarika\u2019s life. But none had dared to speak about her. Hazarika had written about the woman in his life in his autobiography \u2018Moi Eti Jajabor\u2019 (I am a Nomad). But he hadn\u2019t mentioned Lata\u2019s name. However, he had mentioned about an instance that had left Priyamvada teary eyed and that was when she said, \u201cShe (the big star from Bombay) said she loves you (Hazarika) more than your parents and I do.
