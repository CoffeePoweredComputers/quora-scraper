            "answer_text": "No matter what answer I give, it will be somewhat bias because there are so many great living Jazz musicians. So I will just list some that I\u2019ve personally have heard myself. On Trumpet, Jon Faddis, Roy Hardgrove, Wynton Marsalis, James Morrison, Ryan Kisor, Bryan Lynch and this list would be too long. Next, would be drums: Steve Gadd, Dennis Chambers, Herlin Riley, Jeff Watts and Gilrado Piloto. On Sax, Sonny Rollins, Joe Lovano, Kenny Garret, Branford Marsalis, Gary Bartz, Todd Williams III, and Ron Blake. There are several more but once again a very long list. Trombone, Fred Wesley, Steve Turr\u00e9, Conrad Herwig, Trombone Shorty, and Wycliffe Gordon. Piano and/or keyboards, Greg Philliganes, Herbie Hancock, Bennie Worrell, Joey Defrancesco, Barry Harris and this list is long as well. On Guitar, George Benson, Pat Matheny, Raphael Saadiq ( bass guitar too ) Mike Stern. On Bass guitar, Marcus Miller, Peter Washington, Charlie Haden, Brian Bromberg, Ron Carter and many more. Anyone of these players sound awesome as a soloist too and there are so many that I have yet to mention that fit this list too. I hope this help. ",
