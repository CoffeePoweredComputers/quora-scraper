            "answer_text": "The best thing you can possibly do if you seek to get your music out there is to put it on the internet. The internet was practically made to help people out in connecting with other parts of the world and the people that live in those parts of the world. Unsurprisingly, however, there are plenty of people who write music and they put their music online. What you should do, depending on what you currently have written, is to put them on social media and hope for the best. And I mean that with the greatest of hope because a lot of people do not find fame and fortune because, unfortunately, the music business is HIGHLY selective. Since you have talked about writing rap pieces, there is a program on the Apple Store called RapPad where you can write and perform your writings to a beat. Then, you can put them into the community and let other people hear it. There, you can receive criticism and get some constructive advice. I've used it a couple times before to experiment with a couple sounds. It comes in handy. By the way, if you ever get around to make a mixtape, hit me up, fam (lol) ",

            "answer_text": "I say do the same thing you'd do for any instrument you don't play -- find a collaborator that can. Most people are only proficient in a couple of instruments or instrument classes, and that's fine. The voice is just another instrument. So find a vocalist who sings the songs the way you want them sung and collaborate.  There are a number of groups built this way, with a composer at the center of it all and a changing cast based on where the music is going or who is available. The band Incognito is a prime example; their leader, Jean-Paul \"Bluey\" Maunick mostly plays guitar and sings a bit, and he has musicians he works with again and again, but he is the heart of it all and respected as such.  If you are really passionate about singing and want to be in the front, then take some voice lessons. People, especially musicians who know sound and notes, generally have better voices than they think they do; they're just untrained on the physical aspects of the vocal instrument. Assuming no injuries or egregious physical quirks, you can construct a respectable voice in a few years' time, even if you don't feel you have one today. At 16, if you had asked me if I could sing, I would have said no. Today, at 40, I sing often and am regarded as having a good enough voice to back bands and occasionally lead. (Don't worry, I didn't spend all 24 years practicing! *laugh*) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you have two options. First option: Since you have played classical instruments, it is obvious you know how to play an instrument; therefore, you should start a group. Find someone who sings/rap, and you should play your song. No one will play your song better than you, since you wrote it, so it means something to you. Second option: Same as above, but instead of finding a singer/rapper, learn how to sing/rap, and also start your group. There is a third option: you can become a song writer/composer, and you can give your lyrics/compositions to people that can play it. You are a musician; therefore, you know that practice can be GOD-like on your playing skills. This also works for your singing skills, so don\u2019t scratch that just because at the moment you do not have a \u201cgood voice.\u201d Unless you are not interested in learning xD then scratch it right away.

If the singing is not on par with the music it can ruin a song. If you think of voice as another instrument it would be like having a guitarist who can\u2019t play. I\u2019m a musician myself and highly suggest you get a singer. Also, keep writing. Writing can get you far in life. Stick to what you know and you will succeed. ",

In my opinion, a good songwriter is far more extraordinary and valuable than is a singer. So if you can't sing, you do what every other talented songwriter who can't sing has done: you write for other people. I'm not sure if this works the same way in the rap industry. I've always been under the impression that rappers wrote their own stuff, but I could be wrong about that. Thaks for the A2A. ",

I took a year of singing course and worked every day (not necessarily a long time : maybe 15 minutes, but I made a point to do it every day). Results were spectacular. I got a deeper understanding of my own voice, I understood more thoroughly which things were easy for me and which things were hard. I am by no means a great singer, even now. But at least my voice is not the weakest link of my recordings anymore, meaning that I can focus on the song and the meaning instead of the execution. ",
