            "answer_text": "When auditioning for the Rap category, somethings you might consider is that will this rap song i have chosen complement my voice, my vibe, my style? I do not know what companies look for specifically in rappers, but i guess all you have to do is know how to rap. Which kind of rapper are you interested in becoming? Lyrical or Mumble? The difference is kinda evident. Lyrical rappers are more \u201cemotional\u201d in a sense because it focuses more on the lyrics rather than like spitting fire. For Mumble rap, as you can tell, it\u2019s kinda more like spitting the most words in a short period of time, which causes the lyrics to be inaudible and very messy. It\u2019s kinda irritating. But if you are able to spit fire but at the same time enunciate your every single word properly, then that\u2019s great! If you would like to audition for rap, i think the best way to attract their attention is to write your own rap. You can find tips on how to rap online, i can\u2019t provide you any tips since i can\u2019t rap \ud83e\udd23. By writing your own rap, it sets you apart from the other auditioning rappers because it just shows how talented you are. You already know the basics of rapping, and they can further hone your abilities rather than starting from scratch. If i were JYP, i would choose someone who can write their own rap rather than those who can\u2019t. Just an opinion. But i also do have some suggestions for you! Some raps songs & timestamps from m/v: Strange Clouds - B.o.B ft. Lil Wayne (0.13 - 0.53)Chanel - Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Baby (2.13 - 2.54)Woman Like Me - Little Mix ft. Nicki Minaj (2.08 - 2.59)Side to Side - Ariana Grande ft. Nicki Minaj (2.13 - 2.49)Swalla - Jason Derulo ft. Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign (2.26 - 2.55)\ub69c\ub450\ub69c\ub450 (DDU-DU DDU-DU) - BLACKPINK (1.36 - 1.49)Kill this Love - BLACKPINK (0.16 - 0.44)Track 3 - Jeon Soyeon Unpretty Rapstar (0.20 - 1.12)Highly recommended to do raps in your own native language because it might be really hard to enunciate words from another language.

            "answer_text": "for Korean raps, I\u2019d suggest raps from girl groups like Twice and CLC. If it\u2019s for boy groups, then probably Stray Kids, Kard, TXT or Ateez. For English songs I\u2019m not necessarily sure. Maybe you could use an English Blackpink rap from the Japanese versions but I\u2019m not sure if that counts. ",
