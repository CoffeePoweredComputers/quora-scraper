            "answer_text": "Chord progressions are sequences of chords. Let me go through this from both common practice music and popular music\u2019s point of view. Common practice musicWhat\u2019s important to know about chords is that the carry harmonic functions. This means that every chord has its own tendency to proceed to another chords with strong or weak pull towards them. In classical theory the most prominent function is the relationship between dominant and tonic; V -> I (G -> C). The theory behind common practice music is highly advanced. Common practice music counts on diatonic harmony with some additional chord outside the diatonic scale (secondary dominants, Neapolitan 6th chord, augmented 6th chords, Picardy 3rd, etc.) You can study diatonic harmony to understand the chord functions; I\u2019ll provide a book recommendation below. Additionally, harmony (i.e. chord progressions) differs from that of popular music, since harmony in common practice music is tied to voice leading and thus, many times chords can be just the secondary product of voice leading. Popular musicIn popular music, however, songs are many times composed so that first a certain repeatable chord progression is created, and afterwards additional music (melody, percussion, etc.) is stacked on that. From this kind of a starting point, you can choose any chords and put them together for a chord progression, without a need to think how you can \u201cuse\u201d it. If you already have a melody and you are just lacking the chords to reinforce it, you can simply play the melody and figure out suitable chords by trial and error. For more formal approach, you can figure out the notes of the melody and create supporting chords which share same notes as the melody. This often leads to good results. However, you need to take the preceding and following chords into account as well, because some chord progressions just don\u2019t appeal that much. Example:Let\u2019s say we have a simple melody consisting of the notes E -> C -> F -> G.It could be harmonized with chords Em -> C -> G7 -> Em. The melody notes are found in the chords, however, the progression doesn\u2019t sound that smooth mainly because G7 resolves into ambiguous Em. A smoother chord progression for the melody would be C -> Am -> Dm -> G. These chords also contain the melody notes, but the progression works better because there is movement by fifths. If you are ready for more advanced chord theory, you should study modal harmony, which involves chords outside the diatonic range. This includes such chords as chromatic mediants, tritone substitutions, borrowed chords from parallel minor and other modes, etc. This way you\u2019ll learn some nice tricks of common-tone relationships and simultaneous keys affecting the chord functions.

            "answer_text": "oh kevin, if you learn to use chord progressions well, great performers will beat a path to your door. so what is a chord progression? several chords in a row, in any key, that sound good when played in some specific order, and which form the accompaniment for a song or part of a song. i made that up, so there may be better definitions out there. an expensive, and extensive set of two books (thin ones) is bugs bower\u2019s chords and progressions. it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll ever \u201cfinish\u201d these books, and if you do, you\u2019ll be well known among accompanists. be sure to select either the bass or treble clef edition. the most basic chord progression in the most basic key, is C, F, and G7. in F, that\u2019ll be F, Bb and C7. if you refer to chords using roman numerals, that\u2019ll be I, IV, and V7 minor chords are referred to using small letters; major chords are referred to using capital or upper-case letters so C, Am, F, and G7 are referred to as I, vi, IV, and V7. that refers to that progression in any key. so\u2014-if you learn the C, F, and G7 progression, you can accompany zillions of old fifties rock, simple children\u2019s songs, and songs like \u201ctwist and shout,\u201d \u201cla bamba,\u201d etc. but only in the key of C. now if you think of it as a I, IV, V7 progression and learn it in every key, you can accompany all i listed above, and in every key (in case you want to play along with recordings or singers with a limited range). those are the two most standard progressions. there are dozens of \u201cpretty common\u201d progressions, and dozens more \u201ccommon\u201d progressions, and a few great ones that you don\u2019t hear too often. learn em all, in every key, and you will be in demand as an accompanist. and use a metronome to practice and practice. practicing is not playing stuff you like. it could be called \u201cplaying stuff other people like.\u201d stay well.
