            "answer_text": "It can depend on what resources you have available to you but mainly is going to involve physically listening to quite a bit of new music and analyzing data. Are you looking to work with mainly artists in and around your community or are you looking for artists across the globe? These days we have information available to us like never before. You can seek out trending artists on youtube or soundcloud. Find someone you can get behind. Go to smaller shows where artists may have booked their own spot (100-250 cap club venues). The type if artist you sign will also greatly depend on what YOU can offer THEM. What\u2019s your reach in the industry? How much are you able or willing to invest in an artist (time and money)? Answers to many of these questions will point you in the right direction. If you have a lot of capital, your options open up quite a bit. ",
