            "answer_text": "A soundtrack is the digital or analog stripe or stripes along the edge of the film that carries the sound. It is usually multichannel, but can be mono. It is mixed down from several master recordings. These include the music elements, the dialog, and the sound effects. A soundtrack album is a CD taken directly from the music elements (only) of the soundtrack. Most soundtrack albums contain only about 1/2 of the music in the movie (unless there are two CDs in the album). Beware, \u201cMusic from the Motion Picture\u201d without the word \u201csoundtrack\u201d mentioned usually means that someone other than the original movie people created a new recording of the score (or part of it), often with a different orchestra and a different conductor. Once in a while, the companies involved will lie about this. A score is the music written for the movie. Many composers hate the term \u201cbackground music,\u201d and indeed, it is often foreground music. Most scores are a combination of the two. ",

            "answer_text": "A score is a term that generally describes the written notation of a multi-instrument composition, in particular for orchestral works, whether intended for film or not. A film score is the music composed specifically for the film, whereas a soundtrack is the totality of music used in that film, including music not originally composed for that film (such as pop or rock songs used in the movie).
