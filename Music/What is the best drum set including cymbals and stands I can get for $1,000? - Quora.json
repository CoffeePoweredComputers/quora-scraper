            "answer_text": "For $1000, I'd recommend getting your drum stands and cymbals separately. Most complete drum kit/cymbal packages come with really bad quality cymbals. To know which drum set to go for, it's good to decide what sort of configuration you're after. I wrote an article about maximising your time to choosing your drum kit. I personally like to play kits with small bass drums, so I'd recommend either a Gretsch Catalina, Tama Silverstar or Yamaha Stage Custom. If you went bop sizes, you could get one of these lots for around $600, leaving you with $400 to get a fairly decent set of cymbals. If you wanted rock sizes (bigger bass drum and toms), you'd be looking at a higher price, so a decent cymbal pack might be excluded from your spending. I would also recommend to buy second-hand cymbals, so you'll get much more for your money. For example, with $400 you could get a good set of cymbals (hi hats, ride and crash) second-hand. To buy new ones, you'd have to go for a set of Zildjian ZXTs or something similar. While these cymbals are okay, you can actually get good-quality, second hand cymbals. Likewise with drums, you usually pay around 60% of the retail price if you buy second hand. To summarise the main points: - Decide what configuration you want - Decide whether you're willing to go second hand (you might have to be more open minded in terms of brand etc.) - Look to buy your drums and cymbals separately. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "While I don\u2019t have a PhD in Percussion, I have been playing for around 50 years. I have been around a ton of fine drummers, seen a lot at music shows and hand-built the kit that I play now. IMHO, your best bet is to carefully shop on eBay. You\u2019ll find great deals on fine old cymbals, stands and drums\u2014with care. My suggestion would be to find an affordable set of Zildjian 14\u2033 New Beats, with a 16\u2033 A Crash, and maybe a 20\u2033 Zildjian K ride, all older than, say 2005. Zildjian uses computer-aided manufacturing now, and their cymbals sound like it. Sometimes you\u2019ll find cymbals from the 40s, 50\u2019s 60\u2019s for amazing prices: sweeeeeet! Drums: Pearl Drums over the years have always been a great bang for the buck:, well-made & priced. Ludwig have a classic sound but might break your budget. Hint: get an old Ludwig Acrolite. Once considered a student snare, they are quite reasonable and sound like the more expensive chrome Supraphonic\u2014because the shell is exactly the same! ",
