            "answer_text": "Baritenor is a useful musical theater term that describes many, many people in that field, including (and especially) at the professional level. When it's used descriptively like this (rather than proscriptively) it has merit and makes sense. That said, my feeling is that baritenor is a total nonsense term. What it describes is people without the natural depth associated with the baritone voice but without the full high range of the tenor voice. To me, this is code for a tenor who hasn't figured out his high voice yet. Musical theater is very instant-gratification-focused, as a field, so it tends not to encourage people to discover aspects of their voices that may be less instantly accessible. This isn't to say that musical theater performers don't work incredibly hard on their voices, but that they work on polishing what's instantly there, rather than revealing and THEN polishing. To me, baritenors often seem to have the most there, just waiting to be revealed, and I wish they'd all come study with someone smart, so they could reveal it as soon as possible. That's where the real excitement in the voice pretty much always seems to lie, and it seems to me to be a shame that so many people are so comfortable not exploring it. Just my two cents of course, and I'm totally happy to discuss via messages if specifics are more useful! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "In vocal classification I think one needs to distinguish between \"opera Fachs\" and \"musical theater voice types.\" Richard Miller wrote a book entitled \"Securing Baritone, Bass-baritone, and Bass Voices.\" On p.10-11 Miller discusses the baritenor, writing \"The C4-F4 pivotal zone di passaggio of an individual singer my indicate several possibilities 1) light lyric baritone 2) a spieltenor (an actor/tenor), or 3) a Heldentenor (tenore robusto).\" Miller is using classical/opera terminology. When I think of the sound of \"light lyric baritone\" I tend to think more of art song (e.g. Robert Schumann's \"Dichterlibe.\") The role of \"Papageno\" from Mozart's THE MAGIC FLUTE is usually played a lyric baritone. A spieltenor would be Monostatos from THE MAGIC FLUTE (a slightly ugly sound, but strong, and has a \"bite\" to it due to a forward palatal positioning).  \"Siegfreid\" from Richard Wagner's SIEGFRIED would be an example of a heldentenor. I think that \"The Phantom\" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA could be classified as a baritenor role.  The timbre (color) and the weight of the voice are very similar a heldentenor's voice. But the baritenor is also able to sing very full-bodied high notes using a falsetto mix - a musical theater sound. I usually associate a heldentenor's voice with a full chest sound - an operatic sound. ",
