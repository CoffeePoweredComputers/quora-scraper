            "answer_text": "While still far from \"universal\", there is a signiifcantly greater mainstream appeal in metal bands in those regions, partially fueled by the fact that at some point the genre reached its critical mass amongst a population that's both relatively small and somewhat geographically concentrated. Without this climate, you wouldn't have a band like Hevisaurus. Why do I bring this up? Because symphonic metal bands are hard to arrange. It's not like in black metal where one-man or two-man bands abound (generally the second person handles the drums, or both play strings and let the drumming to a drum machine). No, you need people who can play whichever \"orchestral\" instruments you want to add; while the playing tends to be comparatively simple to most classical pieces, it's harder to reach that skill level than what it takes to be an \"acceptable\" instrumentalist in the main trio of rock instrumentation. Furthermore, as mentioned above, a scene with enough bands in a style is more or less self-perpetuating (particularly with side-projects spawning). A few years ago here in Honduras there were very few death metal bands, of which a grand total of one was (semi-)active. But over time more bands showed up and now you have about twenty of them. Same happened with symphonic metal over there. ",
