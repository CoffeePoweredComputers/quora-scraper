This is not to say that a bunch of hypothesis don't exist it\u2019s that there is no conclusive evidence that it is true. Of the few studies I\u2019ve seen over the last two decades or so they tend to smack of the reviewer\u2019s own musical biases such as classical music makes plants grow faster where as louder music like rock is damaging and so on. I\u2019m not even counting the number of times a comedy skit was taken seriously as science when it\u2019s not. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I call it an old wive\u2019s tale. Researchers at the University of California also say that so far there is no conclusive scientific evidence that playing music for plants helps them grow. Scientific tests to prove if sound vibrations can affect plants would need to include rigorous controls over much more important factors: light, water, and soil composition. To be up beat, plants may well do nicely if their owners are taking special care of their plants while listening to music. Conversely, if the plant owners get wrapped up too much in music, they are likely to do something else: over-water their plants. ",
