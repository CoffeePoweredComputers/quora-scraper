            "answer_text": "I would say that the most influentual person in Britain, and indeed on the European stage in the 1830s was Arthur Wellesley, the First Duke of Wellington, who lived from 1769 to 1852. One little item which I own and which I like to think is a piece of history is this little note below, which was written by him in London on 29th June 1834. As you can see, it has the seal of the Duke of Wellington in the bottom right hand corner, and I believe the note is in his own handwriting too, when I compare it with other letters and documents which he did write personally. It reads \u201cThe Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr. Combe (unsure about the name). The Duke will present the petitions to which he refers as soon as they will reach him.\u201d  The Duke of Wellington is of course best known for his victory over the French led by Napoleon Bonaparte on 18th June 1815. At the end of his active military career, Wellington had a political career which saw him twice become British prime minister as part of the Tory party: from 1828 to 1830, and for a little less than a month in 1834. At the time the above note was written, Wellington was not prime minister. His second albeit brief spell came later that year, when King William IV dismissed the Whig government of Lord Melbourne on 14th November 1834 and asked the Duke of Wellington to form a government. Wellington declined, instead recommending Sir Robert Peel. Peel was in Sardinia at the time, but he took control of the government in a caretaker capacity for three weeks until Peel returned and was able to form his government on 10th December. The note was previously owned by my father until he passed away in 2003, but I do not know how or where he obtained it. After his victory as a military commander at the Battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Welington\u2019s career in politics saw him hold the following posts in government or parliament :- Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - in office from 17th November 1834 to 9th December 1934; also 22nd January 1828 to 16th November 1830 Minster without portfolio and Leader of the House of Lords - in office from 3rd September 1841 to 27th June 1846. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs - in office from 14th November 1834 to 18th April 1835 Secretary of State for the Home Department - in office from 17th November 1834 to 15th December 1834 Secretary of State for War and the Colonies - in office from 17th November 1834 to 9th December 1834 Member of the House of Lords, Lord Temporal - in office from 26th August 1809 until his death on 14th September 1852. As you can see the First Duke of Wellington rose to being a very important figure in government and parliament in the first half of the 19th century, though to most British people he will always be remembered as the national hero who commanded the British forces against Napoleon Bonaparte and the French at the Battle of Waterloo. This explains why he was depicted on the British five pound note (pictured below) that was circulation in the 1980s and early 1990s, along with scenes from the battle.  Pictured below is Apsley House in London, the home of the Duke of Wellington, situated near Hyde Park corner and once having the prestigious address \u201cNumber One, London\u201d. Also in the picture is the statue of the duke on horseback which faces the building. Today Apsley House is owned by English Heritage and open to the public as a museum.  I visited Apsley House for the first time only one year ago, in October 2019, and found it to be a fascinating place to visit. If you access the link below you can also have a little tour. \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0iMBvabZKc4\" I am sure that Apsley House would have been a place where the Duke of Wellington exerted a great deal of influence both at home and abroad through the numerous official meetings and events that took there, especially in the 74 seat banqueting room known as the Waterloo Gallery, which had been completed by 1830. Also of course all of the many gifts he received from various British and foreign dignataries on display in Apsley House testify to his influence and the high regard in which the Duke of Wellington was held both at home and abroad.
