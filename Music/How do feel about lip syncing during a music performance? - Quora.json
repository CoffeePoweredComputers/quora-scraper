            "answer_text": "Depends on why. I personally don\u2019t really care for lip syncing that much, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the showcase of someone\u2019s true talent. if you can\u2019t sing and dance well at the same time, whatever. But if you can\u2019t sing live while standing still (and aren\u2019t sick somehow), I have a problem sometimes. I know nerves and stuff can be a factor, but lip syncing while not really moving at all is why I dislike a lot of artists. There\u2019s no point in it. I\u2019d rather you sing live with live autotune then lip-sync. If I wanted to listen to a pre-recording, I\u2019d listen to the album version of the damn song. That\u2019s some real cheating to me sometimes, especially when someone receives an awards based on a live performance alone and it wasn\u2019t really live. ",

            "answer_text": "Lip syncing is \u2018cheating\u2019, plain and simple. Audiences aren\u2019t stupid, and want to hear the real person sing on stage. Also, if the person cannot sing live without auto-tune, and needs to lip-sync to achieve \u2018album-perfection\u2019, then their \u2018talent\u2019 is questionable. I am not against auto-tune for recording and then using the recording as the reference to achieve during live performances, in the same way I sometimes edit a guitar solo and then learn the edited solo on the recording for live performances, but my own live performances are always real (and I personally do not use auto-tune when I record, even if my vocal notes aren\u2019t perfect because I am not a robot\u2026..I\u2019m pretty sure, anyway). :-) ",
