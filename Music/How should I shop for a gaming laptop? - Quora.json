            "answer_text": "First... decide how much you want to spend.  Then, double it.  That's your budget.  Find some way to make that number real... and if you can't, then get as close as possible. Why? Because this is an area that is unlike any other area you are likely to spend time in... unless you are a professional that has to purchase his own tools. A Professional who has to purchase his own equipment.... or an enthusiast who is into an expensive hobby knows that in the end, no matter how frugal they want to appear, there is no limit to how much is going to be spent. Think about how expensive it is to... scuba dive... fly RC aircraft... compete in a sport regularly.  I mean, you might think that running foot races isn't all that expensive... you just have to buy some shoes, right?  Except, there is the training and all the time that takes (time is money, right)... and going to the races, and racing and not winning.  It all adds up.  The Gasoline, the time, the equipment. Playing PC games isn't *SUPPOSED* to be like owning a sailboat... except it kinda is.  You aren't talking about wanting to own a computer you can use to Facebook.  You are talking about a computer that is going to run software that 99% of the other computers out there can't run (or can't run well).  Yes.  99%.  More than that.  99 point something %.  Why?  You want a gaming LAPTOP! You want a mobile gaming platform that has self-contained power and display, that will provide you with a smooth gaming experience for the games you want to play.  You would also like it to be good enough to play some games that will come out in the future that you will want to play. There is NO REASON IN THE WORLD why you should think you should be able to purchase a precision piece of electronic equipment that can do this, cheaply.  You don't have the right to expect to do it cheaply.  A Gaming laptop has components that will allow it to do ANYTHING ELSE ANYONE COULD CONCEIVABLY WANT A LAPTOP TO DO, and do it phenomenally well.  3D modelling?  AutoCAD?  Editing video professionally?  Gaming laptops can and will do these things and more, better than most workstation laptops that are MADE for those tasks. You really have to let this all sink in. I'll wait. If you have made it this far, and you aren't chomping at the bit to argue with me, then you get it... and you probably feel a bit of despair. It is OK.  This is why I said figure out how much you want to spend, and double it.  Now... I don't know where you are, so I don't know your local currency.  So pardon me when I get to recommendations, since.. well... all I've got to recommend is what I'd get. Customization is key.  If you spend a LITTLE more now, you can get a laptop that you WILL be able to upgrade as time goes on.  Have you ever heard of Clevo, or Sager?  Welcome to Sager Notebooks Clevo \u85cd\u5929Clevo makes laptops that can be customized.  Most of them use an actual laptop video card... that you can remove and replace with something better... form factor called MXM.  Some of the larger laptops have two MXM slots.  That's right... a laptop you can have dual video cards in SLI/Crossfire.  Sager is essentially the English version of Clevo.  There are a number of Clevo/Sager units that even feature desktop processors instead of mobile processors... allowing you to have a platform that uses the most powerful and extreme desktop processors.Sager NP9570 (Clevo P570WM) with Intel Desktop Core i7 CPU there's one.But... Sager Custom Laptops that one there is more moderately priced, with a mobile i7 processor, for only $1300. Again.  These are customizable platforms.  That is what makes them better than some $900 Asus ROG system.  If you want to upgrade them in the future... you'll be able to.  In most cases, when you shop at Sager's site, the models you are looking at are the base models in that class.  You can customize what is inside it right there (big blue customize button).  That's what makes them worth more.  They are laptops, that give you some of what makes a desktop better for gaming. The ability to grow as the newer games come out is what makes desktops the ideal platform for gaming.  You should be aiming to get as close to one as possible.  That... and this is enthusiast level equipment.  Don't skimp.  You'll only regret it eventually if you do.  I guarantee it. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like any personal computer you wish to own you have to understand what you\u2019re getting yourself into. But the most important factor as any is your own budget. But I\u2019ll list other relevant information you should look for. Price to performance ratio: Don\u2019t go for the top of the line because it usually isn\u2019t worth it in the world of gaming laptops for average consumers.Thermal Performance: You can try to undervolting the cpu and gpu to avoid these issues. I\u2019d especially recommend liquid metal even with the risk.Build Quality: Especially if you\u2019ll be carrying this around in a backpackKeyboard ergonomics: This is different for everyone and I\u2019d recommend going to actual stores to test they keyboards out.Screen refresh rate: (I\u2019d recommend 120 Hz if possible or higher)Battery Life: Even though you\u2019ll mostly be plugged in for the best performance, it\u2019d be nice to game on the go without being tethered down.Ethernet Port: Doesn\u2019t need explainingWhat can be upgraded: Like memory, ram, storage, etc.Ports: Know what ports the laptop is rocking depending on what peripherals you have.Size & Weight: This will definitely have an impact on how you handle your device, but also the options the come with it.Color Accuracy (Optional): Color accuracy is important, but doesn\u2019t really need to be a deciding factor unless you plan on doing some content creation. But I really don\u2019t know your situation completely.Hope this helps you in your search and good luck. [Also look for sales] ",
