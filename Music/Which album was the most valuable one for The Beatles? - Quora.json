            "answer_text": "First, I must address Mr. Padilla\u2019s answer. I think he greatly overstates the Beatles\u2019 decline. 1) Mr Padilla is correct, The Beatles played to half-filled stadiums. In my original answer I incorrectly said they sold out their concerts. Their final tour seems to have been impacted by John\u2019s comment comparing them to Jesus. 2) No one considered them finished in 1966, to wit: Brian Wilson indicated he was spurred on by The Beatles\u2019 innovations in Rubber Soul to devote himself to writing the innovative music for the Beach Boys Pet Sounds album. I had indicated originally that Brian had stopped touring as a result, but as Mr. Padilla indicated, Brian had stopped touring two years earlier. But The Beach Boys went on tour in 1966 and Brian did not, focussing on Pet Sounds. Furthermore, both Rubber Soul and Revolver were number one on the Billboard 100 in 1966. 3) There was no serious rumor of breakup that I know of in 1965/66. George did threaten to leave around the time of The Beatles (White Album), in 1968 - after Sgt Pepper. But in 1966/67 George was asked point blank on video if the Beatles were going to break up, and he answers a definite, NO. 4) Paperback Writer DID reach #1 in the UK and the US, as indicated by the Billboard 100 Hits. Mr. Padilla turned off replies to his \u201canswer\u201d, so I posted a rebuttal here. Because The Beatles went through several phases, there are several different criteria for determining what was \u201cmost valuable\u201d \u201cPlease, Please Me\u201d: Any first album is valuable to establishing a group, but The Beatles\u2019 first album, \u201cPlease, Please Me\u201d may be considered among their most valuable, because it featured their own songs - something rare for a first album. At the time, the practice was to release an album of covers of established hits to guarantee success. The Beatles convinced George Martin to let them sing some of their own written material, introducing them to the world as not just another foursome.\u201cRubber Soul\u201d: The Beatles broke the pop music mould with this album, they made a statement, and this album is the one that inspired Brian Wilson to new heights of innovation; his Pet Sounds subsequently inspired the Beatles while they worked on Revolver, including their harmonies on their #1 hit Paperback Writer. Their next album was their answer\u2026\u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d: This album gets my vote as the most valuable, so I agree with Mr. Padilla on this. The Beatles were unhappy performing live, because no one could hear them. They decided to retreat to the studio, which would result in such a burst of experimentation, everyone else in Rock was left behind. The Beatles had just learned that Elvis sent his Cadillac car on a \u201ctour\u201d, as if in his place, and they got the idea of making an album \u201cby another band\u201d, and sending that album \u201con tour\u201d, as if in their place. The level of experimentation was unprecedented, their focus being innovation, not sales nor current audience tastes. It gets credit as being the first \u201cconcept\u201d album. That isn\u2019t quite right, the songs were not created around a single concept, but the album was conceived as imitation of a concert performance. In that sense, it had a concept. (a good example of a concept album would be Jethro Tull\u2019s \u201cAqualung\u201d, with many songs dealing with the concept of religious hypocrisy)All their other albums are, needless to say, great collections of wonderful songs exhibiting continually evolving styles. The Beatles NEVER did anything twice, but were constantly looking to improve on themselves and change the game. In a real sense, each album was their new \u201cmost valuable album\u201d - confirming the success of their experimentation and evolution, and driving the rest of the Rock world further onwards. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably Sgt Pepper. It\u2019s kinda glossed-over now, but the Beatles were considered finished by mid-1966. Their last American tour had half-filled stadiums - still of the screaming girls - and that part of it, the adorable Beatles was starting to seem incredibly uncool. They were rumored to be breaking up - George Harrison leaving, especially. It sounds silly to call #2 a failure, but Paperback Writer was their first single (other than their very first single) to not get to #1. The \u201clegs\u201d - time on the charts - of their albums and singles were dropping. And then, Sgt Pepper. I personally would place it way down my list of favorite Beatles albums, but sonically it is still amazing. You have to place yourself in the era, or maybe you don\u2019t, but nobody had done anything like that before. And, it allowed them to carry along their maturing fans, and be, because they were, incredibly relevant. I remember a quote from Greil Marcus (I think) who said \u201cThe Beatles made everything else on the radio sound slightly stupid\u201d. Neo-music hall was what British \u201cpsychedelia\u201d was from 1966\u20131967 (no, not Jimi Hendrix) and most of it is, to me, atrociously bad. The Kinks did okay, and to some extent the Rolling Stones on their singles, because of the great songwriting. But the Beatles were head-and-shoulders above everyone, in a different league. Thus, most valuable, because, as good as they are, a repeat of something like Help or Rubber Soul and continuing to play to screaming girls would have signified to people a movement into being passe. Sgt Pepper was anything but passe, still isn\u2019t, in my opinion. They were now a \u201cserious\u201d group in the public eye. (A note: someone else mentioned Meet the Beatles, and I have to agree that is my preference. Their first three albums are incredible, and one really has to understand there was nobody like them. It\u2019s insanely tightly-played rock and roll, and on the first two, done almost entirely live in the studio.) ",
