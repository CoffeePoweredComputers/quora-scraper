            "answer_text": "In most pieces of music, passages with 2 adjacent semi-tones are the result of chromatic alterations of a diatonic scale, e.g., passing tone, lower neighbour, applied chord etc. The common diatonic scales we use are 7 notes, spaced with semi-tones and tones in such a way so that every chord coming from them is built from stacking major thirds and minor thirds together. (1. major, 2. melodic minor ascending, 3. harmonic minor, 4. harmonic major: and the 7 modes of each). Nowhere in here are there 2 adjacent semitones. To create two adjacent semi-tones, we create a diminished third interval. Once we start using a diminished third in our choice or chord arpeggios then we can get scales like this. 1\u2013b2\u20133\u20134\u20135-b6\u20137\u20138 ie. G-Ab-B-C-D-Eb-F#-G (the d3 is from F#, (G) Ab) at first this looks like a 5th mode scale of C minor with F# (#4) arising as part of a chromatic applied chord to more strongly move to G (V). But music being music, if you take the above scale and start improvising on it, you can artistically stay in that scale and come up with chord progressions for it and keep it as a diatonic scale. Since tertian harmony is the harmony of thirds, and not just the harmony of major and minor thirds, the above can be a true diatonic scale in tertian harmony. There can be chord progressions of tonic-> pre-dominant -> dominant ->tonic. If we make the music, it sounds good, people like it, and more pieces are made like it, the sounds become part of the musical tradition and theories come about to summarize the performance practice of decades and hundreds of pieces, in a few paragraphs and musical examples.

            "answer_text": "I don't know the piece you're referring to in the details, but from your description it could be the Blues scale. Here it is in C: c - d - d# - f - f# - g - a - a# - c More likely though these are transitional notes. Example: when the chords of a piece in C are C -Dm, the bass player may play a c note on the C chord, and play a short c# to \"step up\" to the d note under the Dm chord. That c# is not in the C scale. I could not find the English term for it, but in Dutch it is called \"laddervreemd\", literally : \"scale-alien\". The note(s) do(es) not belong to the tonality used. \"Scale-aliens\" are tricky to use, if you start or even worse, end a phrase with one, it will sound off key. ",
