I guess you can just disregard any that you\u2019ve heard of, it\u2019s hard to know what made it overseas sometimes. I deliberately left out stuff like AC/DC, etc for that reason. There is Dumb Things by Paul Kelly (although it might be known outside the country due to to it being on the soundtrack of the movie Young Einstein, but that is an Australian film, so I don\u2019t know how successful it was overseas):  This one gives me shivers when I hear it sometimes:  Friday On My Mind by the Easybeats:  This one is great to be in the car with if you want to sing (butcher) it, Downhearted by Australian Crawl:  This old sentimental favourite is a interesting one, you can hear his accent, One Perfect Day by Little Heroes:  This one\u2019s dated for sure, but still popular, Take Me Back by Noiseworks:  Girls On The Avenue - Richard Clapton  Something modern is Walking On A Dream by Empire Of The Sun:  Here\u2019s a bonus, something internationally successful, however it was deliberately concealed that they were Australian. The US music industry at that time was a closed shop, foreigners didn\u2019t get their stuff played, so their managers just didn\u2019t tell anyone they weren\u2019t an American surf band:  ",

From ripping off tunes from childrens songs (Kookaburra sits on the old gum tree) Men at Work Lose Battle Over 'Down Under' Flute Riff to having a weird put-on almost hindi accent and a drum beat straight outta Jamaica. It\u2019s a bit of a mess.  I have fond memories of \u201cGreat Southern Land\u201d by Ice house. in particular, the performance from New Years Eve 1999.  I\u2019d started dating my first real girlfriend just 7 days prior (yes, Christmas Eve) , and I\u2019d received confirmation that I had been accepted into the Sydney Conservatorium of Music for a Bachelor of Music course. I\u2019d just played my first big gigs with the Sydney Youth Orchestra, and we\u2019d been confirmed to be performing in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games ceremony. Standing in the audience, aged 19, slow sway dancing with lots of body contact on the shores of Sydney Harbour.  There is an Australian Orchestral Music composer by the name of Carl Vine who has written (as of 2018) 8 Symphonies. His Third Symphony is one of my favorite pieces of music of all time. The section from 23:03 to the end is some of the best music ever written. I discovered this piece in 1998 when studying his 1st Symphony for a music course.  I spent many a year of my 3rd decade on this planet being a snooty music snob. You\u2019d think being exposed to Techno-inspired Classical Orchestra Australian composer Matt Hindson would have done the trick a bit. I got to play one of 4 trumpets (of the apocalypse) of his piece \u201cRave-Elation\u201d on tour with the Sydney Youth Orchestra. Rave-Elation (1998)  In 2017 a girl introduced me to some new music from a very different ecosystem of genres, much of it locally produced by people in Melbourne. The kinds of people you might find playing with their band in a bar in Brunswick or Footscray \u201cup the scraggers\u201d. I liked listening to it because it reminded me of her and how her infectious enthusiasm took me out of my rut and into places I never even imagined wanting to go. And then she left my life. Now it gives me the emotional equivalent feeling to trying to look at the sun. I have to squint and look away. Even thinking about looking back produces some kind of tense pain-glare. Probably because it reminds me of her.  ",
