            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very good album, even great. It\u2019s well-crafted, quite listenable, and appeals to fans of various musical tastes. Upon its release, it was the fastest-selling album ever released. It is the quintessential 70\u2019s pop/rock album. In my generation, around the late 1970s, everyone my age likely owned Rumours and Endless Summer (Beach Boys). Rumours was the second album produced after the band relocated to California and welcomed Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to the group, which appears to be the smartest move Mick Fleetwood ever made. Amid tense interpersonal relationships within the band, and pressures without, the album took a year to complete. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the best album of all time, but you or others might, and that\u2019s fine. It certainly belongs in the top 5 of its genre. As one reviewer aptly put it: Nevertheless, it is difficult not to buy into the mythology of Rumours both as an album and pop culture artifact: a flawless record pulled from the wreckage of real lives. As one of classic rock's foundational albums, it holds up better than any other commercial smash of that ilk (Hotel California, certainly). We can now use it as a kind of nostalgic benchmark-- that they don't make groups like that anymore, that there is no rock band so palatable that it could be the best-selling album in the U.S. for 31 weeks. Things work differently now. Examined from that angle, Rumours was not exactly a game changer, it was merely perfect. (Source)  Further reading: Fleetwood Mac: Rumours Album Review ",

I\u2019m sitting in Floriditas Cafe in Wellington New Zealand, and I\u2019ve just had a truly great breakfast (smoked mackerel hash with soft poached eggs on top, with a cheddar scone on the side). And I\u2019m thinking that the tunes are pretty good as well. And then Dreams comes on. And I think to myself \u201cDamn that\u2019s a great song. In fact, damn that\u2019s a great album. In fact that has to be one of the ten best albums of all time.\u201d And so I think \u201cI wonder if Quora has a question about the best album of all time?\u201d and I do a quick search, and the funny thing is that I see this question. So, it is the best? No, I don\u2019t think so. Live Rust, anyone? But is it in the top 10? Damn right it is. ",
