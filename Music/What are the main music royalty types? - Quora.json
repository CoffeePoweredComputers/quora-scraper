            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure I understand your question? A royalty is a percentage paid every time your music is sold or played. An example could be, you put out an album priced at $10.00. It is reasonable for you to earn a dollar for every album sold, there are a lot of variables involved in the deal you sign, this is based on the old business model. With the advent of streaming with Spotify or Pandora or someone like that. You will get paid tenths on the cent for every song streamed, so it will take a few streams to net you a penny, quite a few more for a dollar. You can put these on YouTube and get paid in similar fashion per view, if my memory serves me, a million views will net you maybe $6000.00. You may want to look that up, I often wonder about the credibility of my memory? The latest craze is sync and licensing, which is basically your songs in commercials or TV and movies. You can collect big dividends up front for music used in the aforementioned, you can collect royalties as well, it depends on who or what it is. Jesse Josephson comes to mind, he has a YouTube channel on this stuff, you might check my spelling of his name. I\u2019ve got a few commercial type songs or ditties I\u2019m working on at the moment. It\u2019s basically recommended you have 3 or 4 before jumping in. Anyway, there\u2019s you a few different ways of earning money through your songs. I hoped that helped some? as stated I didn\u2019t quite understand your question. Good Luck! Robert ",
