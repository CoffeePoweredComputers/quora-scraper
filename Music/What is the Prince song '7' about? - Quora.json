            "answer_text": "It seems to me to be the Book of Revelation filtered through Prince, re-imaged by Prince. Basically, it seems to be the Book of Revelation as it would have been written had Prince been the recipient of the vision and not John The Apostle. There is an element of love being the force that will ultimately be triumphant at the end of time. Seven is a holy number in the Bible, but in this song, 7 seems to be an evil (or at least malevolent) force. They stand in the way of love, after all! At this point, we\u2019ll never know for sure what Prince was thinking when he wrote this. In fact, at the time he wrote this song, Prince may not have even been fully aware of the meaning of this creation. That happens with great art. The meaning of \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d or \u201cSister\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s Pretend We\u2019re Married\u201d was a little more clear, to say the least. ",
