It\u2019s a damn shame that both of these songs are still so resonant today. I was 17 when they first filled my ears, and I sang along with Marvin wholeheartedly, envisioning a world in which the issues he addressed would no longer exist by the time I reached my 60s. I wasn\u2019t foolish to have that vision; I wasn\u2019t wrong to want it. I just had absolutely no idea how backward, wrong-headed, cold-hearted, and greedy our so-called \u201cleaders\u201d would be in the 21st century.   ",
