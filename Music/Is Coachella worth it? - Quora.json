            "answer_text": "Unquestionably, Coachella is worth the price of admission. It\u2019s the best party in the world - literally. The combination of the musical acts (bigger budget = better lineup), the scenic background (sundown is ridiculously gorgeous against the mountains), the soft grass (not always a given for a music festival), and 100,000 fans who are, for the most part, collectively in their best moods, makes for an unparalleled experience. If you wanted to throw this party yourself, it would cost you $50M. But you can attend for just $500. It\u2019s a great deal, and it\u2019s worth every penny. But I imagine that you are really asking a different question, and that is: \u2018Should I go to Coachella?\u2019, \u2018Will it be a worthwhile experience for me to spend these $500 on?\u2019 The answer to that question is more complicated and a bit philosophical. The answer to that question is : \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no, depends on a lot of factors, and you won\u2019t know the answer until after you go.\u201d While Coachella is just 3 days long, in some ways, it\u2019s a lot like a mini-life. We have times in our life where we make new friends, or find a magical new love interest, run into your old friends, or just feel the intensity of the insanely hyper-charged party atmosphere. And then on the best Coachella days, we might hang/dance/party directly with those rock stars who also came for that same party that you did. Coachella is just like that \u2014 with 100,000 people, 88% of them drunk or high, and the world\u2019s greatest musicians playing for you, there are literally a 100 trillion combinations of what can happen in your weekend. It\u2019s like cramming 30 different parties, each party with 3000 different people, into a 72 hour period. Many of those combinations are going to be phenomenal \u2014 because you are surrounded by so many of the key requirements for a great time, this continuous dance party that never stops, because you can keep running from tent to stage, stage to tent, for another band, holding some random hand, ducking in and out of the crowd, laughing your face off. At the same time, it can also be the opposite. Cellphones don\u2019t work well, and you might lose your friend(s) or maybe you didn\u2019t come with any and you didn\u2019t make any. It\u2019s huge, so you might not find your friend(s) for the rest of the night once you lost them. The \u2018meeting place\u2019 didn\u2019t work or nobody showed up there. You may not find a love interest, or you might be unhappy with them one you came with, and in the midst of 100,000 screaming people having the best times of their life, you might feel like \u2018I am not having the best time of my life right now\u2019, and looking out at the insane party around you, that moment may feel like an isolating, sad, and lonely experience. It even accentuates it. It\u2019s not a big deal to have a bad time at a shitty party, but it feels like a big deal to have a bad time at the best party. And, like life, I think there is a very fine line between one and the other. A chance event experience might have milliseconds of sensitivity: He didn\u2019t catch your eye, you didn\u2019t catch his hand, she went to see the wrong band, they were in the Mojave tent, you couldn\u2019t get the drug you wanted, the person you wanted to be with was in a different plane than you were at that precise moment, she was wearing a VIP wristband, and you couldn\u2019t get through the gate, you lost your wallet or your pill or your bag, your friend bailed on you for some random they found, you didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night, it\u2019s too damn hot today, it\u2019s too damn cold tonight, your friend isn\u2019t a festival person, or simply you just weren\u2019t feeling it yourself. Just like life\u2026we have great days, we have difficult days. We don\u2019t know going into a day/month/year whether it\u2019s going to be good or bad. It\u2019s not something any of us can predict with any degree of certainty. If you are thinking about going to Coachella, just Go. I can\u2019t tell you whether you will have a good time or not because the world is a chaotic place. It might be great, it might suck, or maybe it will both be great and suck. If you really, really want to ensure you have that once-in-a-lifetime, worth the money, memory, then go 3 separate times, and I think there is a really great chance that at least 1 of them will be that for you. Have fun, and bring your best vibes with you. Everyone there just wants to have fun. ",
