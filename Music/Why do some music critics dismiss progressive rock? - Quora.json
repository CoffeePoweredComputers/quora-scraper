            "answer_text": "Good question. I don\u2019t know, and maybe I\u2019m biased because I love prog rock. Theories? Anti-intellectualism. Prog-rock lyrics and songs can be complex and abstract, and require work. Three chords in a Bryan Adams song, punctuated by \u201cyeah!\u201d as he goes into a solo, doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to understand the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway the first time you hear it.Narrow demographics. Prog-rock bands and fans tend to be a) white, b) male, and c) British. It\u2019s not a terribly diverse genre. Of course there are exceptions, but the musicians usually don\u2019t have the sort of looks or cool Rolling Stone likes, and they don\u2019t play at Studio 54.They\u2019re not woke. Okay, this is a pet peeve of mine, but somehow\u2014and it\u2019s usually Americans who do this\u2014lyrics are perceived as more profound or \u2018real\u2019 because they\u2019re political or confrontational (even if they\u2019re stupid, and you\u2019re never told what is blowing in the damn wind). But prog songs about Hobbits, vikings, fish, and giant hogweeds generally aren\u2019t.They take themselves too seriously. Bands like ELP and King Crimson, bless their hearts, see themselves as artistes. No talking or photos during our sacred performance, or when we explain how the next movement recalls Schoenberg, or Fripp will storm off in a huff! That sort of pomp invites ridicule.Some of it dated quickly. If you honestly had never heard of the Eagles, it would be hard to place \u201cWitchy woman\u201d as a 70s song\u2014it could fit the 80s or even 90s. As much as I love a band like Genesis, the synthesizers, production effects, and costumes scream the year the album was recorded. This is less so with more acoustic or \u201cnatural\u201d sounding bands.",

            "answer_text": "OK \u2026 as a trained professional musician who has in the past worked as a music critic, and moreover as someone who was a teenager during the heyday of \u2018prog\u2019 I guess I probably ought to have some responses to this. But this is a personal view - I don\u2019t think answers to this question can be anything else really. First off - I don\u2019t \u201cdismiss\u201d prog at all. I really don\u2019t. I think there was a great deal of intelligent music-making by a number of prog bands: Yes, Genesis, ELP. And \u201cKayleigh\u201d by prog revivalists Marillion is one of my favourite records. There were certainly some wonderful musicians - Steve Howe for example is an incredible guitarist. But. I grew up with a number of different musical traditions. I was classically trained and listened to classical music from before I can remember; as a child I would spend hours at the piano voluntarily because to me it was the most amazing thing just to be able to play chords, understand the way music fits together and so on. But there was always music of all kinds in the house (I had older siblings who loved their pop music) so I grew up with the Beatles, the Stones, Motown and so on. So by my early teens I was listening to and playing loads of different stuff; I did my first paid gig as a guitarist (in a pop covers band) at the age of 14. By then I was just as likely to be listening to Philly as Philip Glass; Bowie or Boulez; Messiaen or Roxy Music. My favourite records at this time - and probably still - were by Steely Dan. But I never really \u2018got\u2019 the prog thing (even though that\u2019s what so many of my friends were listening to when I was a teenager) and still don\u2019t. I guess I feel that if you want music that really stretches you intellectually, you may as well listen to Stravinsky; if you want stuff to make your hips move, try Marvin Gaye. And vice versa too - pop and rock music can be incredibly sophisticated and really make you think; \u2018classical\u2019 music can be incredibly moving and sweep you away with its emotions. But I never quite got either of those things from prog. I simply don\u2019t understand why anyone would listen to Pink Floyd - it sounds completely devoid of emotion to me, and nowhere near as intellectually stimulating as even the most basic of classical music. And a lot of the technical stuff in early Genesis - like the eternally changing time signatures and endless keyboard noodling - just seems like willy-waving to me: \u201cOooh, mummy, just look how fast I can do this on my synthesizer!\u201d Also the subject matter is often so similar to the fantasy literature that I find so unnecessary. I\u2019m not really interested in elves and goblins and the music of the mountains and what the fair maiden said. Give me a song or a book or an opera that says \u201cI love you\u201d about a hundred times and that\u2019s kind-of enough for me. The mock-mysticism of prog is a real turn-off. Too many sub-Tolkien plots. And so many long tunes. \u201cHeard it thru the grapevine\u201d lasts less than three perfect minutes and tells a huge story - not a dragon in sight. Do pop songs ever need to be any longer unless it\u2019s to give you more opportunity for uninterrupted dancing? So - I\u2019m not dismissive, but truly that music has just never worked for me on pretty nearly any level. ",
