            "answer_text": "When I first became engaged with his music it was purely how it made me feel. Many of his songs created powerful emotional responses in me. Delving deeper into the lyrics, MM explored a lot of concepts and ideas that I was personally exploring in my college years at the time. To this day many of the old hits bring back a vivid feeling of those times in my life.As I grew older and learned more about him as a person I was struck by how intelligent and contemplative a guy he is. I relate to many of his perspectives and the intellectual journey he has taken personally.Some years ago I attended a book signing and preview of his Born Villain video in Los Angeles with two girls who were my concert going buddies. He was one of the nicest, most genuine, and unpretentious stars I have ever met. It was such a pleasure to meet him in person and get a feel for who he really is. He is not \"Hollywood\" in any fashion, great guy and really personable.I've seen him in concert 3 times and he was awesome in a small venue as well as a large one.I do think however that I was the perfect age over the years for him to resonate with me. I'm not entirely sure his music connects as effectively with other generations as it is very emotive of his particular thoughts at any given time. Being close enough in age with him that it resonates with my personal journey during those time periods I have an affinity for it that others very likely may not themselves.In the end I think the answer is the same for any musicians work, it resonates with certain people on a particular personal level and/or they simply have an affinity for that particular sound.Sometimes people simply find they enjoy particular melodies.I'm a big fan of music and how it can make one feel, the emotion and energy the right song can incite within me is a true pleasure in my life.Thats just me personally though. Lyrics are important to me at times but my primary enjoyment comes from how a song makes me feel melodically...if that makes sense. Its why I'm a huge fan of film scores. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm hardly a marketer, so breaking down MMs fans into groups isn't my thing. And now that especially in the USA his potential fans are probably doped up on antidepressants to cure them of realism isn't helpful for him. I got into MM late, in my early 40s, in the early oughts, when he was tagged as a big influence on Eminem, who also always had an all-ages audience. If you're into Kraftwerk for its huge influence, get into MMs discography, videos, and live performances too. His influence on women artists is larger than on male artists generally. He was the first major star to follow up on Bowie in bisexuality. He was married to Rose McGowan, engaged to Dita von Teese, and partnered for years with Evan Rachel Wood. All of them recount him as inspiring and supportive. His lyrics are often *serious*, not just shocking. See The Beautiful People, Disposible Teens, The Dope Show, and The Nobodies. His covers of Sweet Dreams and Personal Jesus (especially videos, but not just) go beyond just covers to political and religious themes. His VMA Europe performance of The Beautiful People is great. What impresses me still are his insights on the maggot ridden underbellies of success, excess and abandonment, and his early willingness/courage to be an offensive public figure and mix it up, without degenerating to what we see now with the alt right.
