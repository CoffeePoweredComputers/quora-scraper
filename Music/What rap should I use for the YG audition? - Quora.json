            "answer_text": "You can use any rap you want actually. There is not right or wrong in choosing a rap. Choose a rap that you\u2019re most comfortable with and could show your true potential because your goal is so that the judges can see your potential. However, it is better not to choose from YG itself unless you can do it better than the original artist himself/herself. I hope this helps!! Good luck ^^ ",
