Bala Ramakrishnan (bR)\u2019s Answer: The Yellow Brick Road is an image taken from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In the book, Dorothy and her three misfit friends are instructed to follow the yellow brick road in search of the Wizard of Oz, only to find that they had what they were looking for all along. The road leads to the Emerald City in the land of Oz, often referred to as a metaphor for the road that leads to life's fantasies or answers. The lyrics describe wanting to go back to a simpler existence after living what the narrator thought was a good life but realizing he has simply been treated like a pet by his rich socialite lover. The Wizard of Oz was reportedly the first film that Elton John's songwriting partner Bernie Taupin had ever seen, and he used the imagery in the lyrics relating to his own life as his desire to \"get back to [his] roots. (The Above From Wikipedia. ) Let us listen to the song (as performed by Billy Joel and Elton John) as we read the lyrics\u2026 (here Sir Elton sings the song withBilly Joel\u2026  When are you gonna come down?When are you going to land?I should have stayed on the farmI should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me foreverI didn't sign up with youI'm not a present for your friends to openThis boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick roadWhere the dogs of society howlYou can't plant me in your penthouseI'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woodsHunting the horny back toadOh, I've finally decided my future liesBeyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do thenI bet that'll shoot down your planeIt'll take you a couple of vodka and tonicsTo set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacementThere's plenty like me to be foundMongrels who ain't got a pennySniffing for tidbits like you on the ground So goodbye yellow brick roadWhere the dogs of society howlYou can't plant me in your penthouseI'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woodsHunting the horny back toadOh, I've finally decided my future liesBeyond the yellow brick road I DO HOPE THIS ANSWERS THE QUESTION\u2026 Bala Ramakrishnan (bR) ",

            "answer_text": "It is a paean to not wanting to be a \u2018 trophy\u2019 boyfriend to a rich socialite. Initially ,when first released in 1973, Elton deemed it necessary to pretend he was heterosexual ( to the extent of marrying a German lady, Renate , around 1984) so I, probably along with many others thought it was a sung about a female. Whstever the gender, he is saying that he is not prepared to be treated like a new acquisition and be shown off to the persons friends. He acknowledges that she will be upset when he leaves the relationship, but advises that there are plenty more like him to be found, waiting to be picked up by the likes of his now- former lover. As always, the lyrics would have been written by his then collaborator, Bernie Taupin. ",
