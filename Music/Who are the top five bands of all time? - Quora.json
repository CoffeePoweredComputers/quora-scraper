            "answer_text": "Who are the top five bands of all time? That\u2019s not as easy as you might think. Different bands are \u201ctop\u201d for different reasons. There are the top 5 best live acts, the top 5 with the most talent, the top 5 who sold the most records, the top 5 who were most popular, the top 5 punk, the top 5 R&B, the top 5 metal, well you get the idea. That being said, I could give you MY top 5 bands of all-time\u2026today. I say today because if you ask me again tomorrow, I would likely give you another answer. So, today, here are my pics: The Beatles: No list would ever be complete without this band. It would be like trying to paint without ever using the primary colors. The Rolling Stones: Still playing, still recording, still alive! \u201cThe Beatles wanted to hold your hand, the Stones wanted to burn your town to the ground\u201d. Led Zeppelin: Such talent, such power, such is rock and roll The Band: With apologies to Cream, the Band is the best supergroup to ever exist. The Grateful Dead: Really? But they were a joke\u2026and kinda ugly. Maybe so, but they defied everything that was \u201cthe norm\u201d and turned it all on its head. Let\u2019s let people tape our shows\u2026for free. Let\u2019s release an album\u2026and rarely play any of the songs on the coming tour. Let\u2019s sell the majority of our tickets\u2026through a mail order that we set up. Let\u2019s play a different show every time we perform\u2014but your fans won\u2019t get to see their favorite songs\u2014they can just follow us around if they want\u2014NOBODY will do that! But you won\u2019t sell a lot of records?!? Well, we don\u2019t sound that great on them anyway, we\u2019ll just play a ton of live shows\u2026 There\u2019s my five. My rock and roll 5 (I could do a punk 5, a funk 5, a reggae 5, etc.) I feel bad leaving out Traffic, The Allmans, Yes, The Who, Skynyrd, The Velvet Underground, ELP, The Kinks, Pink Floyd, ZZ Top, etc. but this is my list today.

            "answer_text": "Without a doubt. ..The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beach Boys and The Eagles or Black Sabbath. Can't do just 5. I mean, what about Sonny&Cher or the Osmond\u2019s & the Jackson's, Cream, The Monkee's. They were big.. Had their own TV show. They wern't just extra's on Good Times\u2026.lol. This is an unanswerable question. I thought heard someone in the back mumble Metallica. Who said that! Show yourself!..By Grateful Who? Guess Who? Who? Jerry Lee Lewis. Now that was a bad@ss, whisky drinking, minor marring, piano playing mother f#$@er. Chuck Berry, his contribution to Rock & Roll is emense. Almost as much as Van Halen, who made the Kinks famous a second time and made doing any covers after that a crime (or should have been- remember-Dancin\u2019 in the Streets- a crime). I'm still shuttering. Let us not forget the king. No, not Rodney, Elvis. Another partying, minor corting womanizer which reminds me of Frank Sinatra. He was smooth\u2026you see where I'm going with this? 5? Five? It can't be done. Thanks for coming, be sure to tip your waitress.. ",
