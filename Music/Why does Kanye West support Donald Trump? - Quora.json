            "answer_text": "Why does Kanye West support Donald Trump? Note: the following answer was collapsed by Quora with no explanation. To what might this collapse be attributed to? Note: Quora restored (uncollapsed) this answer for public viewing. Thank you, Quora. You might as well ask why Black's support of Trump has jumped from 13% in 2016 to approaching 40% as we speak. What is painfully obvious to those who are not captured by the incessant disinformation of the anti-Trump mainstream media, is that Blacks are waking up to the lies of the Democrats, mainstream media, and the political left. Since Kanye came out for Trump with his appearance in the oval office, leftist mainstream news sources have been going berserk, screaming their damage control strategy of disinformation about Kanye. Come on people. We know Kanye is perfectly sane, perfectly and capable of making his own free choice as an America citizen. Yet, the leftist mainstream media is incapable of allowing any black man the right to think for his or her self. No! they say, blacks must be Democrats! Kanye must be crazy! He must be a white supremecist! Yes, unhinged left controlled media CNN and MSNBC is actually saying things this stupid. The Democrat party, the party which was originally the party of slavery, Ku Klux Klan, and Jim Crow, thought it had succeeded in convincing the American public that racism had somehow switched political parties in the 60's when they passed massive welfare plantation policies out of white guilt. What really happened was that Democrat slave plantations merely moved to the ghettos of Democrat run inner cities, which are most of the major cities in the US. No Republican policy has ever enacted racist policies of any kind. The way the Democrat welfare plantation works is that you give black families monetary hand-outs they don't have to work for as long as they don't have a father in the family who could bring in income. As a result, black families, which used to have as many fathers per family as any other race in America, became fatherless. All you need do to determine which black families are doing well economically is to check if that family has a father or not. Black families with fathers are at pretty much the same economic status as other races in America, except, of course, for Asian families, which have pulled far ahead of all other races in terms of economic status. So Democrat instituted policies which on the surface seem to be doing the right thing for black, turned out to destroy black families, black pride, black men and, of course, black sons who turned to crime, gangs, violence and endless poverty. Inner cities are the new Democrat plantations, and Kanye knows this. He knows that President Trump has reached out to the black community with real solutions instead of lies. Black unemployment is at its all time lowest in history. Trump has taken aim at the socialist ideology of the left that continues to enslave blacks and promises to enslave all Americans with its promises of \"free stuff\" for all. Nothing is \"free\" in life. Democrat policies have an unacceptable price tag. That price tag is the loss of our individual rights, responsibilities, self-reliance and initiative, resulting our inevitable enslavement to the plantation state. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me be concise in my answer: Kanye supports Trump because he\u2019s an idiot.  Need proof? Try this on: When confronted about comparing himself to Jesus Christ he said, \"You want me to be great, but you don't ever want me to say I'm great?\"He\u2019s not a fan of book-learnin\u2019: \u201cI am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.\u201dThis is extra goodly since even if a book could give an autograph, it probably wouldn\u2019t want to give one to Kanye.He joined Twitter right after publishing this angsty comment on his blog: \u201cI DON'T HAVE A F___ING TWITTER. HEY TWITTER, TAKE THE SO CALLED KANYE WEST TWITTER DOWN NOW ... WHY? ... BECAUSE MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS LOUD!!!!!!!!!\u201dHe once offered to change his name to \u2018Martin Louis the King Jr.\u2019 to help promote $1000 Louis Vuitton shoes.Responded as such to a review of his album: \u201cWhat's a B+ mean? I'm an extremist, its either pass or fail! A+ or F-! You know what, f___ you and the whole f___ing staff!\u201d (at least on this he is truthful, since he dropped out of school).He has doubled down on his claim that \u201cAIDS was a man-made disease placed in Africa just like crack was placed in the black community to break up the Black Panthers.\"His \u2018music\u2019 is uninspired and contrived (personal opinion, that).Splurged \u201cSidebar: I have to use the bathroom really, really bad,\" in the middle of an interview with Conan O\u2019Brien.He considers himself a \u201cBlowfish\u201d when it comes to protecting his family\u2026He married a Kardashian. Enough said.Is there any reason a guy like this wouldn\u2019t support Trump? They\u2019re essentially 2 stupid peas in a stupid pod.  ",
