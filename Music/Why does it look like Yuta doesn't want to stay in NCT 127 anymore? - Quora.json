            "answer_text": "Let me break this down, since I see it come up more and more often. To clarify, I\u2019m Yuta biased.  1. Why people think something is wrong with Yuta When \u2018Kick It\u2019 came out, as usual NCT did a reaction video to the M/V, where Yuta seems really annoyed and uncomfortable. Yuta does have fairly little lines in the recent comeback and has little center time despite being probably the second best dancer after TY in 127.  Trust me, it\u2019s likely the members are a 100% aware of the line distribution uneven, and it\u2019s not their fault - it\u2019s the company\u2019s decision. 2. Yuta\u2019s popularity/place in NCT I wrote here about why Yuta gets outshined in NCT, but that does not mean he\u2019s not popular, I\u2019d say after Taeyong/Jaehyun/Mark he\u2019s the 4th most popular member, around the same level as Haechan and Johnny. Yuta is one of the unofficial visuals in 127, a main dancer at times, and one of the back-up centers, and he\u2019s very loved by the rest of the members. This is really obvious from how they interact with him, even if their on-camera interactions are likely very different than off-camera ones.  3. What Yuta actually said Good thing about this guy is that he\u2019s fairly outspoken and blunt, especially by idol terms. During his recent VLives, he talked about how the members are when they talk, chill, eat together, how they get in fights etc sometimes - they just act like human beings. He also said that he wants to focus on his own identity too, that\u2019s why he made an instagram too, and wants to experiment with styles etc. (also go follow him on Instagram if you don\u2019t yet YUTA \u60a0\u592a (@yuu_taa_1026) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos) [V LIVE] We have to talk face to face \ud83d\ude3a\ud83d\udc9a [V LIVE] Everyone, thank you so much! ! He also said multiple times at any given opportunities that he\u2019s very proud of this album, himself, and the members. 4. He does have a bit of a resting bitch face. Yuta has one of the most beautiful smiles in the world, that\u2019s no news.  However when he\u2019s focused, he looks like this. And he does kind of look annoyed, even though this was literally 5 seconds before he started playing around with Johnny on the stage.  5. Just let him be We have no idea what\u2019s going on with NCT behind the scenes, even if they do act fairly open with NCTzen. He could be having a bad day, he could be having family/relationship issues it could be he just didn\u2019t feel like smiling, it could be they are busy preparing for the repackage/ot21 comeback and have not slept in days. It could be literally anything. Yuta is a very honest guy, if something bothers him, I trust him to speak up. And remember what Jaehyun said regarding this matter: \u201cstop overanalyzing members interactions, because we don\u2019t know what happens off-camera\u201d.

            "answer_text": "idk but i\u2019ve noticed he looks more unhappy recently, too. it might have to do with winwin in 127? i mean anyone can see that they were really close, and i know they members were hoping winwin would be able to join 127 again soon because in early 2019 right after wayv debuted, taeyong said that winwin would return eventually\u2026 also, maybe he\u2019s just getting really sick of that lack of lines? he\u2019s definitely been getting a lot more than before, recently, but he\u2019s still such an underrated vocalist. maybe he\u2019s upset that they can\u2019t perform in front of a real crowd because of corona. truthfully, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of those things though. there is probably something going on behind the scenes that we don\u2019t know about, that\u2019s how it usually is. maybe he has a sick family member he can\u2019t visit back in japan (especially with the virus). maybe he\u2019s just been in a slump. we really can\u2019t know. all we can do is try our best to hype him up and support him to show how much we love him!
