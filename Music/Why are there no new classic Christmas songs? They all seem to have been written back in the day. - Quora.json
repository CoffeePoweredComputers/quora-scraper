            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve observed, at some point some 20 years ago, they stopped playing the old standard Christmas carols in shopping malls and other commercial venues, in favor of secular Christmas songs. I can understand why they did this\u2014-not every customer is a Christian, and some might not care to hear \u201cSilent Night\u201d or \u201cHark, The Herald Angels Sing\u201d if their interest in the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays is purely secular. Yet playing Christmas music from the day after Thanksgiving until the store closes late Christmas eve is considered a dandy way to get customers into a spending mood, so they needed replacements for these old carols. So they started digging around for secular holiday songs, because when they subtracted all the religious songs there wasn\u2019t much left\u2014-just \u201cJingle Bells\u201d and \u201cSilver Bells\u201d and \u201cWalkin\u2019 In A Winter Wonderland.\u201d What they found were a lot of vaguely Christmas related songs from the fifties and forties, usually about relaxing in front of the fireplace with a hot toddy, or enjoying a beautiful snowfall. They also recycled a lot of songs that had been strictly little children\u2019s songs back in the day\u2014-\u201dFrosty the Snowman\u201d and \u201cRudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,\u201d for example. So songs that hadn\u2019t been all that popular for the past 30 years suddenly made a comeback: \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,\u201d \u201cSanta, Baby,\u201d \u201cSleigh Ride\u201d (both the original orchestral piece and a tacky sung version), \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home For Christmas\u201d (a favorite WWII song), the Beach Boys\u2019 entire Christmas album,\u201d and \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d Musicians are still coming up with new Christmas songs, because, if they catch on, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ll become classics; but they\u2019ve also found that performing the same old standards can be lucrative. So we have 9000 versions of \u201cChestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire\u201d and \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d\u2014-and the public never seems to tire of them. ",

            "answer_text": "You could try a British hit from December 2008. It was a charity single (raising money for the NSPCC) co-written and sung by Peter Kay, using the persona of a character he had created a year earlier for \u201cBritain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice\u201d a comedy series which spoofed the \u201cfactor/got talent\u201d shows which have been infesting the UK Christmas charts for the last thirty years. Kay\u2019s character \u201cGeraldine McQueen\u201d released \u201cWinner\u2019s Song\u201d in 2007 and we all assumed that he would move on to a new idea (he did two years later with \u201cThe Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour...Now On Tour\u201d) but it turned out that Peter really did have a bee in his bonnet about those talent shows dominating the charts every Christmas and decided to try and do something about it. First a caveat. If you haven\u2019t already played the link. You will almost certainly find yourself singing it \u201cover and over and over again\u201d if you do. The result was  \u201cOnce Upon A Christmas Song\u201d. It somehow parodies the Christmas hits of the past and acts as a good \u201cChristmas Song\u201d at the same time, possibly because Peter really does love those old songs. Unfortunately it only reached No5 in our charts. The No1 spot being taken by one of those \u201cshow winner\u2019s\u201d songs, Alexandra Burke\u2019s version of \u201cHallelujah\u201d. ",
