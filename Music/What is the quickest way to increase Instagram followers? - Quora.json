BUT, it takes efforts, consistency, uniqueness to be in the top. Growing thousands of followers for many different accounts, i have figured out some of the best ways that helps me grow Instagram followers in a fast and a organic way. Using these ways you can grow your account even if you have less than 100 followers to hundred thousands of followers within months. Below i am listing some of the ways using which you grow your followers, these tips not only helps you grow your followers but also to improve your profile engagement, brand awareness and have a good social presence. Content is the KING : Original Content : This is one of the most important reason for success of any big page on IG, Make sure you are posting original content, no one wants to see repeated content on all pages.Provide FREE value as much as you can : Remember, you can only grow if you are providing free value to the audience,audience will only follow you if they are getting real value which can make them smarter, happier, improve their life, get to know something new, learn something that may helps them in improving their career, earnings, better fashion tips, dress smartly, look confident etc.Relatable Content : One of the popular ways why many accounts attracts lots of audience is because they post content that the users can connect with, they feel emotional connect, similar thinking. So, try to put content that is easy to understand and people easily connected with it.Profile Optimization : Profile Picture : The first thing that any user sees whenever someone founds your content useful/interesting/entertaining is they look towards your profile picture, make sure to have a profile picture which depicts your brand, easily to read in small thumbnails if it has a text or a logo.Username : Try to keep it similar to your brand/name/business . Don\u2019t use too long usernames, keep it short and crisp. Try to avoid period or underscore in username.Bio : Bio plays an important role for every new visitor to page to whether scroll down to your page to see your content or not. Bio in points works best. First two lines of Bio are very important, you should mention what is your page is about, what type of content users will get to see in that page. Then after two lines, you can provide some additional information or Call to action, to follow your page or visit your link.Highlights : If you post stories, then you can categorize them in different highlights providing the best stories that you posted.MOST IMPORTANT TIPS : HASHTAGS : Hashtags are the most important factor for any account to get their posts reach to millions of users without spending any content. I see most of the users spend hours to create content, writing captions but hardly takes 5 minutes to choose their hashtags. You have to spend time to select them. Make sure that you are choosing hashtags related to your niche only. Don\u2019t change your hashtags in every posts, best way is to use 11\u201320 Hashtags, using same hashtags again and using 30 every time can make your account shadowbanned, don\u2019t select hashtags which have too much volume, try to use hashtags within 1 million posts, unless you have more than 10k followers, also don\u2019t use which have too low volumes. When you found hashtags which does good for you, make 3\u20134 sets of them and use them randomly on posts. The rules for hashtags don\u2019t work same on accounts, you have to figure it out what method works best for you.Users Engagement : There is no use of having thousands of followers, if your engagement rate is low. Its one of the underrated thing which most people ignore. Having a good followers engagement in your page, can really help you boost your post, have better growth and Brand Awareness. Try to interact with your followers as much you can. Reply every comment in your posts, ask them questions, Ask about their opinions, tell them to tag their friends that can be benefited from your post. Use stickers in Stories. Ask your followers to follow on Post notifications.Call To Action : Many of my clients complained that get despite getting thousand of likes, they are getting very less amount of followers or link visits or sales, this is because they don\u2019t add any Call to action in their posts or they try to use it in inappropriate way that makes them looks spammy. So, what i recommends is have a proper post caption, firstly mentions the what the post is all about or starts with asking a question, then proving value to the audience, details about the posts, minimum 2\u20133 lines. After that just simply ask them to give a follow if they want to see more of your valuable content, visit your bio link to know about you etc. REMEMBER, adding call to action is necessary to get better results, because, most of the people will just simply like your content and scroll down.Consistency : Many people complained even after following all the ways told my be they did not see any growth or get good results. When i visit their profiles, i saw that they did not have any consistency in their account. Sometimes they post in weeks, sometimes more than 5 posts in a day. This is what making your profile not ranking good. Instagram runs on smart algorithms that their developers spends years too develop and continue making changes everyday. So, the algorithms are developed in such a way that if the found users to be consistent on the platform, posting at proper timings, engaging with users, don\u2019t spam the platform, gets good results in the posts then the account automatically gets good rank in hashtags and on explore page.So, these are some of the most smartest ways to grow on Instagram at a good rate and get good amount of organic followers.

I help people with Growing their accounts, Making strategies, Account management, content creation and getting the sales for their business.

            "answer_text": "The absolute quickest way to increase your Instagram followers is paying for them\u2026 No, not going on a dodgy website and \u201cbuying\u201d fake followers.. That\u2019s not what I mean. What I\u2019m talking about here is using Instagram Story ads to get the right sort of people to follow you. This is what I used to build up a brand new Instagram account to over 1,000 followers within a matter of weeks.  So how do you do this? THE TECHNICAL DETAILS Make sure your Instagram profile is set to a business profile (see video here on how to do that)Go to Business Manager Overview and connect your business profile to the Facebook business managerGo to \u201ccreate\u201d; choose the \u201ctraffic\u201d objective on Facebook.. and then choose what audience you want to reach with the ad. NOTE: Target people \u201cworldwide\u201d as Facebook will find the cheapest possible audiences across the world - if you target the highest tier of countries, you will be paying a premium; which I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to do.Make sure you select the Instagram story placement and then choose a 15-second video that you want to run to the audience. (15 seconds are the limit for Instagram stories)WHAT VIDEO TO RUN The only thing you need to do in the video is make sure that you showcase some sort of value to people In short: Why shoud people follow you? For example if you are a photographer\u2026 just showcase some of your work, let people know what to expect from your feed and invite them to follow along. If you travel the world.. let people know that you\u2019ll be sharing some cool adventures on your feed.. and once again, invite them to follow along. That is literally it\u2026 Just from doing that.. in a matter of weeks you will have 100s of targeted and real people from accross the world following your feed.
