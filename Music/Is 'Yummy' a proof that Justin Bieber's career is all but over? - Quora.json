            "answer_text": "I hope so. His music is particularly grating. He is the king of that tacky 21st century invention auto-tune, the sound of which turns my belly. His career has gone on for 13 years or so. In that time he has not evolved musically one jot. The lyrics are just as childish as before. And he copies hoary old chestnuts like chorus line dancing. Oh the corn! He was an appealing looking child star but has become another sleazy, tattooed adult. As he is not pushing any boundaries or contributing anything substantial to the history of music he should bow out. Teen idols past their use by date need to either grow up or get out. ",
