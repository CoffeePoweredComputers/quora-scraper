            "answer_text": "Do you mean a Composer or a Record Producer as they are different things - sometimes with crossover but as such different skillsets. If you just want to land some backing tracks then as suggested, look up platforms like Fiverr where you can get one or several freelancers to help you finish your idea. I have one offer there where I will develop a full track from a loop. Record Producers are similarly available but why not find people who are doing Indie work and see who has Produced their record then find the Producer\u2019s website and see if they would be interested in working with you. This is how I get most of my clients. But I will say that many who approach me, don\u2019t do a stellar job of presenting themselves so really do your research on the person you want to work with and put your best foot forward with a nice email and links to demos of your work to get them eager to have you as a client. If you are looking to get in touch with a big name then, by all means, look for their website or Facebook but you may well find that they don\u2019t accept unsolicited contact so either they shunt you to a Manager or Booking Agency who are partially tasked with keeping the riff-raff away. If you do take a run at a name, have a really nice Bio and intro letter. Even better have your Manger do it for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with all the comments made before, but want to give you some very practical, hands-on advice: make a demo on your own, and then send it out to people who may want to help you make your vision reality. I'm guessing you do not have a big budget (otherwise your question would sound more like \"How do I get rid of all the producers and find the right one\"), but my advice would be the same anyway: find someone whose taste in music you trust without reservation, and who genuinely connects with your music and believes in it. Most great producers started out producing their own bands or their friends, and if you are on a tight budget you should be looking for someone in your circle of friends/fans. Just make sure they take the job seriously and feel responsible for getting it done. Any producer who claims to be the right guy for the job before they heard your music (i.e. at least your self-produced demo) is definitely not the right guy for the job, especially if you have any budget to speak of.
