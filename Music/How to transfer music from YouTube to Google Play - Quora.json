            "answer_text": "You cannot directly transfer music from YouTube to Google Play because you need to download YouTube to FLAC or MP3. To achieve YouTube to FLAC, you need the help of YouTube Music Converter. Step 1. Open TunesKit and add \u2018Chrome\u2019 to it. Then set the output audio format as MP3 and edit the value of audio parameters. Step 2. Launch Chrome from TunesKit and navigate to YouTube. Choose one music track on YouTube and begin to listen to it on YouTube. Step 3. Then TunesKit will record music from YouTube and if you want to stop the recording, just stop the playing of the music on YouTube and click the \u2018Stop\u2019 button on TunesKit. Step 4. Next, you could trim and cut the recording audios according to your personal demand. After editing, you could save YouTube Music on your computer. Step 5. Finally, you could log into your account on Google Music and upload YouTube Music into Google Music. ",
