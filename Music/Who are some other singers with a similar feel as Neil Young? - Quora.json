            "answer_text": "Are you asking about other singers whose songs and singing actually sound like Neil Young's, or about other singer-songwriters in the same lyrical / musical vein as Neil Young ? 'Cause there is a difference. The Top 40 band America so blatantly mimicked Young that many people thought \"A Horse With No Name\" was a Young song the first time they heard it. That's not a compliment, by the way. On the other hand, there are singer /songwriters who work the same musical fields, with a similar feel, as Mr. Young - Without strictly imitating him. On that list, I would include: Warren ZevonMy  Morning JacketGram ParsonsGiant Sand / Howe GelbBruce SpringsteenGrant Lee PhillipsJackson Browne ",

            "answer_text": "I am a singer-songwriter who has often been compared with Neil Young. This is a great compliment because he is one of my favourite songwriters and musicians, however, my songs do not feature harmonica or the grunge-style guitar, that Young is famous for. I think it is my voice more than anything. See what you think by listening to my songs at Reverb Nation. ",
