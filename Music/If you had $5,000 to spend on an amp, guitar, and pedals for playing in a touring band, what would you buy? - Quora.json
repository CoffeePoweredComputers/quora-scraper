            "answer_text": "$5000 is quite a considerable amount of money for guitar, amps and gear. If it were me these will be my choices: RnR Sound SOLO: It\u2019s a 1U rack-mount 50-watt clone of the Soldano SLO with the effect pedal friendly effects loop mod. It\u2019s easy to carry it on tour. You can just put it in the instrument rack. It barely consumes 1U rack space. It costs around $950.Mojotone 2x12\u2033 Convertible Isolated Speaker Cabinet loaded with Avatar U.K.-Fane M65 and H75 speakers: It\u2019s easier to carry around than a full-size speaker cab and it can be used in all kinds of venues. The speciality of this isolated speaker cabinet is that it operates in stereo mode, i.e., it has provision to mic each of the speaker separately. The total price will be around $940Yamaha SPX200 Effect processor: For reverb, delay, modulation, pitch shift and other effects . The advantage of using the SPX2000 is that those effects can be put on the microphone signal. It costs around $1350.Yamaha MFC10 pedal to control parameters of the SPX2000: Costs around $280.Miscellaneous pedals: I\u2019ll just pick up random pedals. A mid boosting overdrive like the MXR GT-OD ($100), MXR Noise Clamp ($90), AMT Electronics WH-1 Wah ($100).As for guitar I\u2019ll choose a guitar with double locking trem and decent quality pickups: There are many option under $1000. A Jackson Pro Series Soloist, an Agile Interceptor Pro, or a Solar S or A series guitar. The Agile Interceptor Pro guitars cost under $700. Most of them have Korean made Floyd Rose trems but they can be easily replaced with a Gotoh GE199T trem, it costs barely $110 and in terms of quality is as good as made in Germany Original Floyd Rose and Schaller Lockmeister trems.As for why I have chosen the SPX2000, the reason is quite simple. As mentioned before the two speakers in the Mojotone isolated speaker cab can be mic\u2019d separately. So, send the output from the microphone used to mic the M65 directly to the mixer. This is the dry signal, the Celestion G12M Greenback like mid-range of the M65 lets the guitar easily cut through the mix. Compared to a G12M Greenback it\u2019s a lot clearer though. Run the signal from the microphone used to mic the H75 into the SPX2000 configured to operate in mono-input to stereo-output mode. You\u2019ll get fully wet stereo signals. Send them to the mixer and pan them left left and right. The H75 is voiced after a Celestion G12H30, but it sounds more refined than the G12H30. Its G12H30 like low end response and upper mids lend width to the guitar tone. You can apply pitch shift effect and delay on these two wet signals two make your guitar sound massive in a live gig. So, there you have it, a kind of an improvised wet-dry-wet rig without spending a fortune on a real wet-dry-wet rig. Do ensure that the two microphones are in phase with each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it would very much depend on my role in the band, and what kind of music it was. If I really was limited to just $5,000, then I would buy this:  I would go straight into the PA system, using a TRS to XLR cable so that I wouldn\u2019t even need a DI box. That would be all the gear I needed in my role as acoustic guitarist. If I were able to get a really good deal on it, so that there was something left, I would buy this:  As it comes with a profile for the above guitar, it gives an extremely accurate impression of a true acoustic guitar. The Aura acts as a DI box as well, in addition to tuner, compressor and feedback destroyer.  If my role was electric guitarist, then it would be:  and  Again, straight into the desk. Because the two of them together can be got second-hand for under $2,500, I might supplement it with one of these, when found on eBay, which would come in at around $2,500, second hand price.  With this gear, I can go anywhere and play anything. But what about all the effects? The VG-99, which is the box shown in small, is a comprehensive two channel guitar, effects, amp, cab and microphone modeller. It\u2019s got almost every effect ever devised, and you can run four separate guitar sounds through it from the Godin\u2014a piezo and a humbucker/single-coil from the Godin, and two modelled guitars from the VG-99. Each channel can have up to ten effects, in addition to a modelled guitar (which can also be a modelled synth), modelled amp, cab and microphone. Both channels are stereo. For outputs, it has fully independent L & R XLRs and L & R jack, so you can send the desk one thing and have something else going into your stage mix. You can even output midi to drive a synth, though, seriously, you don\u2019t need to. You can even model acoustic guitars, and the guys on the desk will tell you they\u2019ve never heard such a studio sound come out in a live gig. I pair it with this:  If budget was tight, I would forego the Mesa-Boogie, which is extremely heavy to carry, and take the Godin, VG-99 and FC-300, which, in the appropriate carry bags and cases, I can carry over my shoulders and in one hand and still run for a train.
