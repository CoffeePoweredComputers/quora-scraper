            "answer_text": "I\u2019d strongly recommend Ableton Live, never been a fan of FL Studio but it seems to be a capable DAW oriented for Electronic music as well, may be worth checking out for yourself and see how you like it. You could use any DAW really, you can pretty much load any VST plugin on any track but the interface will make a difference in making certain tools more acessible and also some DAW specific plugins and editing tools might come in handy. That\u2019s why I recommend Ableton Live. I\u2019ve done 2 electronic tracks using Reaper only and it was fairly good, although reaper doesn\u2019t seem to handle many vst plugins and all that midi processing all that well to be honest, experiencied quite a few crashes. Also editing midi in Reaper is \u2018meh\u2019. Great DAW for recording and mixing real instruments, wouldn\u2019t choose anything else over it. Ableton live on the other hand is optimized not only interface-wise but also for heavy MIDI processing and handles it quite well. ",

            "answer_text": "First, it\u2019s important to realize that any software solution is so much easier than anything electronic musicians used to use thirty plus years ago. So any tool with a record button will do the job. But i would suggest you to think about Logic Pro. There\u2019s nothing better when we\u2019re talking about electronic music. If you want to go live, well, Ableton Live is great. I use it in theaters to cue some effects and music and it has very simple UI if you want to put some ideas together in a few minutes. Of course, if you want to record some analog synths and doing some hardcore editing and proper mixing, you want Pro Tools. I use it to record and mix live bands and for film/tv post-production. ",
