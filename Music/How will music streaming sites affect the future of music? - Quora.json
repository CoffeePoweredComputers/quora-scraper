            "answer_text": "After the downfall of the CD through internet piracy and digital downloading, it was inevitable that companies would begin offering high quality libraries to download from. This matched the new preferred means of consumption for music products, and Apple transitioned with iTunes brilliantly. Streaming sites like YouTube made free and instant access to music inevitable, and the libraries we see on Spotify now are nearly unbelievable. The future is here: instant access to all music anywhere and anytime. The music itself no longer earns very much money. Small bands must tour relentlessly to make any money, and even mega acts like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have to fill up as many stadiums as they can to make their millions. Small bands and their music will someday be entirely funded by fans and fan interest, while mega pop stars will still be run by corporations as \u2018brands\u2019. Very popular bands will arise in very particular style genres, but will go wholly unknown to the general public. Only true revolutionaries from the subgenres will make it into the mainstream, while entire musical trends will grow and die independently from one another. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows yet. There\u2019s still ongoing controversy about how much artists are being paid. However, so far streaming has started to improve the state of the industry and more people choose to stream than to buy digital download nowadays. It\u2019s certainly going to be the new thing for a while but who knows what will happen in the next decade? I can say that already streaming has changed the way the industry operates however I can\u2019t say what it means for the future of music. We have already witnessed a dramatic change in the last decade and millions of physical format companies (CDs for example) have already shut down. Currently there is a lot of controversy with streaming companies from artists who are being paid less than a tenth of a penny for each song that gets streamed. This means artists can only make a small living by being streamed over 100,000 times or so. ",
