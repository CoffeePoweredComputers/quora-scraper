            "answer_text": "As a medium, the Compact Disc should have stayed in the 20th Century. The future (i.e., now) should be about high-resolution downloads in FLAC or ALAC. By high-resolution, I mean 24 bit depth instead of 16, and 88.2/96 kHz or 176.4/192 kHz sample rates. As your playback device, as long as that CD player works, then just keep using it. Some of the issues with ageing that can affect playback are dust/grime build-up on the Laser\u2019s lens. Attempting to clean it yourself (Q-tip and isopropyl alcohol) is very tricky as there is a high risk of damaging the coils on which the lens is mounted, responsible for focus and tracking. Another thing that can happen with time, is that if any rubber belts are part of the rotation and/or tray opening/closing mechanisms, these might have lost their elasticity and grip. Luckily, that can be easily fixed: just find the same size and gauge and replace them.  The real issue is the discs themselves: some CDs which you might have purchased in the mid \u201980s like I did, have already exceeded their shelf life of ten years three times! The Reed Solomon code is the most efficient error correction and concealment system, to a point where any physical medium that came afterwards (DAT, ADAT, DTRS, Nagra D, \u2026), also adopted that system over conventional crossword code and other redundancy schemes. Disc rot If the rot, or scratches, are not too big, your CD player will either entirely recalculate the original bits that should have been there, and in the second instance, will make an educated guess using interpolation: inspecting the previous proper audio word, and the next proper audio word, to guesstimate what the word sitting in between would have been. These two error correction/concealment schemes are inaudible, so you might think that everything is OK with your disc. If several consecutive words are damaged (despite clever interleaving of data on the medium to avoid just that!), then some CD players will mute their DAC output, resulting in a nasty little - or BIG - click. Some CD players go a step further, and instead of muting, perform a crossfade between the last set of proper words, and the next set of proper words, thereby concealing the missing portion. Unless this happens exactly on a transient, and unless the gap is huge, again, you might not even notice something is wrong with the disc. It is a wonderful piece of technology, when you think of it, and plenty of improvements have been implemented over time, such as oversampling: it\u2019s such a normal thing to do now, that it\u2019s hardly even mentioned! The very least nowadays seems to be 128x, which means the actual playback sample rate, and proportionate amount of words the digital reconstruction can play with, is at least 5.6 MHz! Then there\u2019s dithering - again, something so normal now that it\u2019s hardly ever mentioned on the front of the player. I find that popping in a CD requires a certain commitment, not unlike the person taking a vinyl out of its sleeve to place it on the turntable: you mean business. You are going to sit in that sofa and listen to your music - dare I say a FULL ALBUM, as opposed to randomly skipping in an iTunes playlist. Listening to a CD is an active involvement, in a world where we get too easily distracted when trying to listen to music. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. Obsolete, no! Old fashioned & outdated, certainly, but if you still have a reason to use it, then it is still useful!I used \"you\" there & that's at the crux of your question - \"is my cd player.....\".If you'd asked, should I buy one, or on what medium should I buy my music, then I would answer against CD.As it stands, you already have one, so it follows you have cd's to play on it - why not continue to do so?!With regards to continued music buying, I would suggest buying hi rate lossless flac & burning to cd as desired. Average CD audio quality is not as high quality as flac, so ripping from CD wont get you to a flac level soft copy, though will be perfectly listenable for the cd's you already have, just don't bother buying anymore.Do remember though, if not cared for properly & stored correctly, cd's will deteriorate & may well become unplayable. Keep clean, dust & scratch free, keep out of direct sunlight & avoid strong magnetic fields, so a loose pile on top of the speaker will not lengthen their viable life. How long you continue to use it & how long you keep it on a shelf or at the back of a cupboard will be decided by you & your reasoning.I still have an 8 track player I used in my first car - yes I still have a couple of tapes, but we only had the option of prerecorded & they weren't my choice. So the only reason I keep it is so that one day, if someone, somewhere, tells me they wish they knew someone who could make a digital copy of their fav track, only ever on 8 track.I can be fairly certain this will never happen & I recognise what this says about my need to please, but its my personal & nostalgic rationalisation that balances the negligible cost of knowing I still have my 8Track.You will know when your cd player is obsolete to you.

            "answer_text": "yes, and rapidly getting more so. The motors wear and so do the bearings and bushes which handle the armature and spindle. While there are CD\u2019s still being produced, BluRay and DVD players will handle the CDs, so there is no reason to make more CD players or parts for them. Digital based devices are now far easier to produce and can use other forms of storage (cloud, SSD, SD/memory stick, HDD on a rope) to backup data, something which the CD\u2019s you\u2019ve paid for can\u2019t do. But if you rip the CD music, and store the CD music digitally, then you still have rights to listen to the backups (provided you legally acquired a property copy somehow). The digital player doesn\u2019t need to power physical motors as well as the amplifier, so uses less power, and is lighter, and less likely to be damaged by knocks, vibration, moisture, or rapid changes in direction. It can access music faster, and depending on how good your ears and training is, can hold a better quality recording of music, and more of it. Access it faster, and create different playlists (depending on the device). The only thing that your CD has going for it, is that it\u2019s easier to borrow someone else\u2019s disc for a while. (being a single physical copy, it\u2019s easier to prove you\u2019re not duplicating the IP) ",

If I want to keep information for 30 years, I have more faith in CD\u2019s than hard drives or flash drives. I have CD\u2019s that are 25 years old that I wrote and they still work fine. I cannot say that about hard drives. USB flash drives and SSD\u2019s are a crap shoot. It seems that unless used, they start failing after a year. Tape based backup is relatively reliable but the machines to read them are not. ",
