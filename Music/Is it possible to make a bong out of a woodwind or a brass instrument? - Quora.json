            "answer_text": "You're writing a book, good sir. You can do whatever you want. It is absolutely possible, by the way. Bongs can be made of many things, including the barrel of a gun. Since you're the one writing, you don't have to explain. You can just assert that it is possible, and let the story unfold around your new bong. That's the whole aim of science fiction: assert that it is possible, then enjoy the consequences.  As far as practical application, you would either want a separate bowl to heat in (which would make your instrument a glorified tube) or you would seriously hurt any wooden or brass instrument. Theoretically, the bottom of a sax would do it. An oboe would make an impressive bong. A french horn would be interesting, and a huge tuba would be lots of fun. Any of the woodwinds you would have to cover all the holes, which would make it more challenging. ",
