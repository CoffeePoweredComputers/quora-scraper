            "answer_text": "As I am\u2014at this exact moment\u2014taking a break from the interminable audio editing for a science fiction anthology (\u201cFinal Frontier\u201d celebrating the anniversary of Apollo 11), I can not only answer that for you, I can do it without opening any windows. Sound is a modulated pressure wave. A vibrating object\u2014say a tuning fork or an astronaut\u2019s vocal chords\u2014causes ripples in the air around it. These ripples propagate out as waves through the air (or water, or in rare circumstances, spacesuit helmets), much as waves do in the ocean. When they strike a human ear drum, they cause it to vibrate at the same frequency, and at an intensity proportional to the original vibration. That vibration is converted into impulses that travel to the brain, which understands the frequency of the vibration as pitch, and the amplitude of the vibration as volume. The top waveform below shows a vibration of 440 cycles per second (440 hertz). This is the same pure tone made by a standard A-440 tuning fork, which we hear as \u201cA above middle-C.\u201d I\u2019ve put the waveform for \u201cmiddle-C\u201d (261 hertz) and \u201cA below middle C\u201d (220 hertz) below it for comparison. Note that as pitch decreases from the top to the middle left to the middle right, the space between the peaks and troughs grows wider\u2014the frequency, or speed of vibration, gets lower.   With pure tones like this, it\u2019s easy to see that doubling the frequency results in the pitch being one octave higher. That\u2019s why all musical instruments have the same eight notes (or 12 half notes) over and over again. Each repetition is a doubling in vibrational frequency as the notes climb the scale, or a halving as they descend. That being the case, if you speed up a recording, you increase the vibrational frequency of the sound it reproduces and so its pitch. This is fine for pure tones, but problematic for more complex sounds like that of Astronaut Stanley G. Love\u2019s narrated foreword, which I\u2019ve shown in the bottom waveform. Complex sounds like human speech are made up of large numbers of overlapping vibrations that give the sound not only pitch, but texture. When you speed up a recording, you speed all of them up, so instead of an astronaut talking really fast, you get the sound like a pontificating squirrel. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some good answers already, but they\u2019re each approaching the question from one possible angle. It seems the question could be referring to either the Doppler effect or to the effect of fast-forwarding an analog recording. In either case, the premise of the question doesn\u2019t hold true in all cases. First, let\u2019s talk about a moving sound source. Doug Dillon points out quite correctly that the source frequency doesn\u2019t actually change with motion. In his example, the violinist is also the observer, highlighting another important point: the Doppler effect depends on the relative velocity (both speed and direction) of both the source of the sound and its receiver. Consider a rapidly approaching violinist (maybe they\u2019re also a gifted sprinter\u2014 just go with it). When the violinist begins playing a constant note, it emits a wave. Because sound has a finite speed, once the violinist starts moving, each wavelength emitted is emitted slightly closer to the receiver than the one before, and since this delays the total transit time, the wave peaks arrive closer to each other. Since we perceive increases in frequency as increases in pitch, the receiver perceived the note as higher. Since the opposite is true of a receding sound source, it is incorrect to say that any sound\u2019s pitch is higher at higher speed. Consider an analog recording like a vinyl record. These devices have wave-shaped grooves that interact with a needle, which in turn interacts with a magnetic field to produce pulses of current. Eventually, this current interacts with a speaker to produce a sound. By drawing the needle across the record at higher RPM than the recording, more pulses of current are produced in the same amount of time. The speaker translates this into a higher frequency sound. Digital recordings don\u2019t necessarily reproduce this effect, so even from a recording standpoint, the premise of your question isn\u2019t always true. ",
