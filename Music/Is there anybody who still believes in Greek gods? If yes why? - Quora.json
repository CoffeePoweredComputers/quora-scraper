            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only met a handful of people who still worship in the Greek pantheon. But don\u2019t be deceived by their small numbers! The Greek gods do, in fact, exist. What, you want proof? Read on, then:  - Everything that begins to exist has a cause.- The universe began to exist.- Therefore, the universe has a cause.- The first cause that makes the most sense is the goddess Gaia being born out of Chaos.- Therefore, the universe came to be as a result of Gaia being born out of Chaos.- Gazelles are perfectly designed to run away from lions.- Lions are perfectly designed for hunting down and killing gazelles.- This design can not possibly happen by chance.- Therefore, the design of lions and gazelles must be the result of intervention by something that can design such a thing, aka a supernatural intelligent agent.- Gazelles and lions are both designed to thwart one another. They are opposites, locked in an eternal struggle.- Therefore, they must have separate competing designers. - We have books written by our ancestors that say the Olympian gods are always fighting among each other. The books also say that the gods created all that is.- Because everyone agrees with the validity of these books, they are the best explanation for the opposite nature of lions and gazelles.- Therefore, the competing designers of earth life are the Olympian gods fighting for supremacy.- The Roman Empire was a very powerful empire.- Therefore, it could not have collapsed for no reason.- Hence, there must be a reason it fell.- If the Roman\u2019s survival was dependent on the favor of the Olympian gods, then abandoning them would result in the collapse of the Empire.- The Empire collapsed shortly after the Olympian gods were traded for the Christian God.- This is too unlikely to be a coincidence, and it was foretold in the books our ancestors wrote.- Therefore, because the Roman Empire collapsed soon after leaving the Olympian gods, the gods exist.I\u2019m sure an experienced apologist of the Greek gods could give an even better defense of the faith held dear by thousands, but this is plenty to get you started. Thanks for the great question, and \u00edthi eutukh\u0113s! ",

            "answer_text": "Congratulations! You\u2019ve gotten the attention of a faithful servant to the Gods of Olympus. Our religion is known as Hellenism, and is a polytheistic reconstructionist faith dedicated to the religious practices of Ancient Greece. Though, being half Italian, I also add a little bit of a Roman flare to how I venerate the Gods. I was initially baptized an Episcopalian, and stoutly firm in my faith as a child, but as I grew older, and started to look into what caused the Dark Ages in Europe, and read further in depth about the Crusades, I quickly began to realize that I had been lied to by the Church all this time, and that was something I could never forgive them for. How could a perfect god create so much imperfection? Why should anyone dictate who I should worship and how I practice my faith? My parents thought me insane when I told them, even though my father was far more sympathetic to my cause than my mother. So I decided to find a new faith, one that had all the freedom of worship in religions like Shintoism, but didn\u2019t have all the strictness of the Abrahamic faiths. Having loved Greek Mythology ever since I was a little boy, I studied and researched more about the Ancient Greek and Roman religious rites, holidays and ceremonies. That\u2019s when I realized that the Olympian Gods were far more reasonable than just one god. Why place myself in the hands of a deity that rules as a tyrant, when I could show thanks and favor to a democratic pantheon of gods and goddesses? I also was fond of reason and science, and I knew that these were the gods of my paternal ancestors from Southern Italy. When I turned 18, I finally left the Church for good, and have been openly showing my favor and thanks to the Gods for their magnanimous and just rule. I never looked back, never had to; never will. All in all, it was a good decision, as it did wonders for me in the end. ",
