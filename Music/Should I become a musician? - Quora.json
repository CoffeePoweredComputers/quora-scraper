            "answer_text": "If you believe that playing music is something you must do, by all means be a musician. It's a great thing to do, at least in part because you can touch and communicate a great deal to those who listen. That being said, these days it's difficult to make a living just playing music - any kind of music. It's possible, but rare to find musicians who can solely depend on playing music. My opinion is that you should continue to play whatever music you enjoy, but give serious consideration to what kind of work you'd like to do additionally. Finish high school, go to college (which most likely will not be boring), and keep learning. Perhaps teaching music, or finding work in other music related professions such as recording, composing, organizing music events, etc. You may also choose to do some type of work unrelated to music, but continue to play as your \u201csideline\u201d. Many musicians do this, and are satisfied. It\u2019s very nice of you to want to give back to your parents. I think with some hard work, and making some good career choices, you can do both - keep enjoying playing music, and give something back to your folks as well. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I tour internationally in a band called The Broadcast. Heres my quick advice: forget money because there is no money in music. Going into it assuming that will be your best friend. Unlike most jobs, your talent unfortunately is not an indicator for how much your salary should be. We make very little money, BUT the tradeoff is this: In the last three years my band has traveled the world, recorded an album with a multi Grammy award winning producer in LA, performed with countless legends and played in front of over 250,000 people collectively. The friends we've made and the experiences we've had FAR SURPASS ANYONE I know making good money. I've traveled more, eaten more incredible meals, and seen the sun rise and set more times I can count. So doesn't that say something interesting? Money doesn't necessarily buy you the freedom to experience the best things in life, doing what you love sets you free. Just recently I was cruising a Citibike in South Beach Miami with a Cuban sandwich in my hand, a fresh coconut to drink and less than $20 in my bank account. It was GLORIOUS. Being a musician is an honor and tradition that needs to continue throughout generations to come. We are blessed to create the life force behind SO MANY lives. Finally, try to start NOW being innovative with your income. Being a musician is not just about shows ~ think about alternative revenue sources ~ teaching lessons and workshops, YouTube tutorials and daily blogging, merchandising, branding, all those things often dismissed by musicians can be incredible tools to alleviating financial stress. Best of luck to you! ",
