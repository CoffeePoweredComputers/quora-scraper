            "answer_text": "At first I was very exited (you know being an Arianator) that a new Ari song is about to release and it will break all records. She collaborated with her friends- a duo named Social House (people don't mention them most of the time while talking about \u2018boyfriend\u2019 which is quite sad) who also helped her in making of the Thank u, Next album (her latest album released on 8th February 2019) related to songwriting and making beats for songs. Honestly, I expected more than what she served me (after releasing such bops the expectations are quite high). I will give it a 7 out of 10. It could have been way better but it sounded like a mixture of Knew Better/Forever Boy song from Dangerous Woman album and Thank u, Next song from the album of the same name but anyways, I liked the harmonies and soothing voice of Ari\u2764.
