            "answer_text": "None of us can really help you, because in the end, it\u2019s the company\u2019s decision, and the company\u2019s decision alone. But here are some things to know: Being Korean will help, a lot, there\u2019s a small chance of you being East Asian and getting in, and extremely slim chance of you getting in if you\u2019re not Asian at all. Companies are looking for talent and potential. If you are already a good singer/dancer/rapper or you have the potential to be a great one, companies might be interested. Visuals will help. In the K-pop industry, everything has to be pleasing to look at. Visuals help you get scouted and asked to audition. If people are scouted because of their visuals, it\u2019s mainly because they fit the Korean Beauty Standards.  Irene of Red Velvet is known for fitting the KBS extremely well, she has all of the factors. Straight but slightly arched eyebrowsPale, flawless skin (Darker skin is despised in the industry and the companies might try and lighten your skin.)Small mouthPlump lipsV shaped jawThin noseBig and double-lidded eyes (Aegyo-sal is a bonus)The chances of debuting are slim: I don\u2019t think I need to explain this. The industry is a very competitive place, with hundreds of groups debuting every year and barely any of them succeeding. Depression runs rampant. I feel as if a lot of young people dive into the industry not knowing how dark it is. Many idols suffer from depression and anxiety which is mainly from the pressure of the industry. And what\u2019s worse, is that they might be forced to hide it. TWICE\u2019s Mina took a hiatus because she was diagnosed with anxiety, SHINee\u2019s Jonghyun committed suicide because he was suffering from depression. There are many more, but I feel as if these are the basics. Good luck if you decide to you want to debut. Stay healthy and safe at home. ",
