            "answer_text": "OK here goes: 1. Capt. James T Kirk.  I gotta give the top spot to kirk. If not him (Shatner) there would be no Star Trek and the world would be a darker place. Besides the guy basically banged everything in galaxy!  Green chicks? CHECK! Coworkers/subordinates? CHECK!The Gorn? CHECK!You know a tribble or two found its way down Kirks trowsers! (Aka where many have gone before!) CHECK!LOL! 2. Q. Q, (John de Lancie)  was a flagrant, glorious violation of Roddenberry's rule that everything in the ST universe must be grounded loosely on scientific theorys/principals. The only other time this rule was broken was to do away with Wesley Crusher. Most (myself included) would have preferred to have had the crew take it upon themselves to blow him out an airlock like Cyclon on BSG. The fact him and his whiney Doogie Howser/Sheldon Cooper/Annakin Skywalker ass was gone was good enough. To be fair Q could have been an extra dimensional being and wasn't breaking the laws of physics constantly by utilizing matter and energy from elsewhere within the universe to manifest his powers. But that's REALLY pushing it. 3. Spock. The perfect counterbalance to Kirk's bravado. Spock's intellect and cunning (& chastity) he (Leonard Nimoy), (RIP) was just as responsible for ST becoming the phenomena that we all know and love. Spock kept Kirk from either dying young, or turning into a villain that makes Kahn look like Mr. Rodgers.  4. Spock. In ST the alternate timeline (JJ's ST) Spock (Zachary Quinto) has in my opinion replaced Kirk as the one to carry the show. I hope on one hand for more movies flashing out this alternate universe. On the other hand I've read Paramount won't consider a new spinoff featuring Capt. Warf while they are still producing content for JJ's ST. 5. Warf I've made many jokes about Warf being a yuppy Klingon who would leave the federation for the Klingon Empire if it weren't for the benefits package, and the tax hit he'd take rolling over his 401k! Seriously though he saved DS9 from the crapper. If there is anyone at Paramount who thinks he can't carry a Capt. Warf spinoff that exec should have his blow allowance taken away till he comes to his senses and makes this happen. 6. Data. I really would have preferred to leave Data off this list. If for no other reason than Brent Spiners ego and that god awful TNG movie he wrote. Borg queen? Really? REALLY!? Nothing like flushing years worth of cannon to give Data a moral delema. Before Spiner & Patrick Stewart highjacked TNG and took it off the rails Data was a really great character, and Spiner did a fantastic job fulfilling the role.  I believe if Gene Roddenberry was still alive we would have had classic TNG movies as was the case with the originals. 7. Seven of Nine She gave Voyager something truly unique to set it apart from the other series running at the same time. Jeri Ryan was a really good pick for the role. She's also a total babe! (So shoot me I'm a pig!) 8. Jonathan Archer Didn't the whole cast of Enterprise make your my 10 worst list? Yes. How does Capt. Archer (Scott Bacula) make the 10 best list?  Because he wanted it so bad! It's no secret that Scott Bacula wanted the captains chair of the starship Enterprise. Badly!  How badly? Bad enough that an Actor of his caliber signed on to do a prequel TV series after Star Wars (most notably) and more than 3 other properties made attempts in both movies and TV failed. Just the fact that he uttered the line \"launch grappler torpedo\" without rolling his eyes and shaking his head deserves an award. 9. Quark. Quark (Armin Shimerman) was the sole reason to watch DS9 till Warf showed up. I can't have been the only one to hope he'd pee in Odo's bucket while he was sleeping am I? DS9 would have been a lot better if Quark would have pulled some backroom deal that saw him take command of the station. With all of DS9's resources at his disposal the starfleet crew could be given a proper ship and had a full time job of trying to figure out and thwart the worst of activities.  This IMO could have been a really good plot device leading the crew to almost anywhere. They'd also have moral dilemma's as someone else pointed out. Given a choice Quark would much prefer to help the good guys, (so long as they can pay) so the question of do the right thing and help Quark build his empire. Or let the good guys get hurt but nail Quark for something? 10. Montgomery Scott. Scotty, (James Doohan) was always able to push, pull, scrape, and claw enough out of the enterprise for Kirk to pull everyone out of the fire. In a fight between the original ST and TNG despite the TNG ship being 1000X more powerful and actually working most of the time. Does anyone really think Kirk and the original NCC-1701 wouldn't find a way to blast Picard and NCC-1701D to atoms? It would probably involve wiping his bottom with the prime directive, and starting and interstellar war in the process but Kirk and co would do it somehow! ",

            "answer_text": "Spock - began the tradition of using aliens to represent one side of humanity and have discussions around that. Trek wouldn\u2019t be Trek without Spock.Picard - While the Spock-Kirk relationship is the best out of all the series, and that gives Kirk a good argument for the second spot, Picard is the heart & soul of Trek\u2019s new direction with the Next Generation. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Patrick Stewart brings something none of the other actors can.Kirk - Can\u2019t put him any lower. It\u2019s easy to make fun of Shatner, but Shatner\u2019s distinctiveness made the role iconic as the face of what it means to be explorers.Data - In Data, the Next Generation writers found a character that served to muse a very large number of episodes. His pursuit of what it means to be human parallels Picard nicely.Worf - Over the course of two series, he came to define the virtue of being Klingon which led the Klingons to become as beloved as they are today.Kira - the first great female character on Trek. Here development along with that of the Cardassians as a species brings us something unique to the universe. She could have been even higher if Deep Space Nine had more fully committed to her as a more interesting character than Sisko.Seven of Nine - she was only there for 4 seasons, but she made the show work. She brought out something interesting in all the characters around her.Emergency Medical Hologram - crackled right from the start. Perhaps the first Trek character to be both utterly petty and rude and yet adorable. His character grew like no other and you can certainly argue he\u2019s the best character on Voyager, but there is the matter that he was at his absolute best when he was with Seven.Garak - The greatest minor character in Trek history. More fully realized many character with far more screen time.O\u2019Brien - The great blue-collar worker of Trek, made to suffer like no one else. We loved him warts and all.Honorable Mentions: McCoy - has a great, great relationship with Spock and a very good relationship with Kirk, but he isn\u2019t much more than those relationships. Odo - not everything works about Odo as a character - romance was weird - but the Changelings were a fascinating species that drove compelling story. The Ferengi of Quark\u2019s bar - between the uncle, the brother, and the nephew, they generated an amazing among of story. They gave us the heart & soul of the wild frontier. ",
