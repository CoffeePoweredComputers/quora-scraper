            "answer_text": "I read the question and tried comparing 'beauty' with Jesus. Umm\u2026It didn't go well. Well, actually for many many centuries we were governed by Greeks and then Romans and these guys placed great emphasis on beauty. Their legends and myths were replete with beauty contests and 'My husband is hotter than yours' stuff. Even their chief God, the ultimate man-whore Zeus was a sucker for beauty. Well, there wasn't a pretty woman he didn't forcefully sleep with. So naturally, when the civilization today stemmed from the followers of these beliefs, our mindset did too. That's why it's Adonis and Helen leading our beauty brigade, not Jesus or any other God.  ",

Thats way I think alot of greek statues are naked because they have nothing to hide. Except for poor old Hephaestus he got thrown off Mount Olympus. So if you are every compared to Hephaestus don't take it as a compliment(he is disformed and ugly). ",
