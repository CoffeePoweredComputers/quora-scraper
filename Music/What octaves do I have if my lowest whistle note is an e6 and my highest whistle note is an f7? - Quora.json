            "answer_text": "E6 to F7 is only one octave and one half note\u2026 My suspicion would be that you actually have the whistle which I have in my own hand as I write this answer. That whistle is one in high F, and you should have, therefore, notes beginning at F5 available to you. The F7, on a high F whistle, is likely to be the highest truly useful note, though most whistles will produce three full notes higher than that, giving you a total range running from the lowest F, which is the F5, up to C7. I am unaware of any maker producing a whistle which begins down below at either F6 or E6. The highest key available in a standard Generation tin whistle is high G, one note higher that my F whistle. These are very small whistles, and may be difficult to play, for those with large fingers. I have two high G whistles. One is too hard-sounding and unpleasant; the other is very musical, but is not tunable at all. The musical one dates from the First World War. ",

            "answer_text": "That would be a very limited wistle. Usualy if you vary the strength of your blow, the wistle will produce more than 2 octaves. The range you mention is only 1 octave plus 1/2 tone. Check online because there are several ways of producing suplementary notes, depending on the model of the wistle you own.
