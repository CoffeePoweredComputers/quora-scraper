            "answer_text": "Let me just say it is absolutely amazing and insane at the same time. I originally thought it would be a peaceful concert but about 3 weeks before the concert I was seeing all these videos for her prior tour stops and realized how insane some of them got. The concert started at 8 and I got to the venue at 12pm. The girl at the very front said she had been there since 4am and soon after her people started showing up. Lucky for me the long hours of waiting got me a good area. If you have an assigned seat it\u2019s peaceful but if you\u2019re standing which was the way the venue was for me, it\u2019s crazy to say the least. When workers from the venue asked people to start lining up and stand up form the ground, all hell cut loose. People ran and left behind tents, blankets, umbrellas, chairs, etc. Once inside, there were 6,000 fans standing and squished waiting another hour or so before it actually started. The AC was broken and it was summer. Six people passed out before the concert even started from dehydration and heat since outside water wasn\u2019t allowed. Once the concert started everyone pushed so much that she had to stop and ask people to take a step back. Girls around me were taking off their shirts since it was so hot. The girl in front of me would get her hair pulled by all the pushing so I had her hair all over me stuck because of sweat. Water was being shared. You were definitely getting elbowed especially if under 5\u20196. Needless to say I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t pass out. However, even with all this craziness, yes I would do it again. She sounded amazing and had such a great song list. She put on a one of a kind show. And if you\u2019re wondering, yes you can hear her in person unlike in videos with screaming people. These are just some pics of that day.    ",
