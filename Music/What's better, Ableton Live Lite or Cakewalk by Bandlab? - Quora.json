            "answer_text": "Cakewalk by Bandlab was Sonar by Cakewalk, which was one of the major Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) contending with Cubase, Logic, and Ableton. It\u2019s completely free, but for Windows only. Ableton Live Lite is a pared down version of Ableton Live 10. It looks and works the same, with same engine, but some of the effects is not included, and it has limited track count. Because Cakewalk by Bandlab was a full-fledge DAW which then gets rebranded, right out of the box it\u2019s more powerful than Ableton Live Lite, and cheaper too. If you upgrade Ableton Live Lite into Live Standard or Live Suite, then feature-wise it will be comparable. But Ableton comes with more instruments and effects. Regarding workspace and user interface, Ableton is simpler because it\u2019s built with the philosophy of having everything can be seen at a quick glance in one screen during live performance. Cakewalk is more cluttered and somewhat complicated, because the goal is to give you more customization through multiple docks you can keep open or close. For mixing and making music both are comparably good, albeit Live Lite has more limitations. For recording, Cakewalk wins with the ability to keep multiple takes in one track. You have to record multiple takes on different tracks for Ableton. For audio file or loops manipulation, Ableton is more intuitive. And Ableton trumps any DAW in terms of live performance. For future support and development, Ableton is more superior compared to Cakewalk because Ableton has a clear future development plan and Ableton community is one of the most active community. Cakewalk is free, so as any other free things, you have no way to be sure if they are going to be available (or if it will keep being updated) forever. ",

            "answer_text": "they are both great! I use ableton live lite for all my music production because i am not willing to buy the full verison yet. Cakewalk is also great to use because they have plenty of loops and samples to use while ableton is more abouting letting you expand your libary. I\u2019d try out both if i was you to see which one you prefer. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going back to a diffrent program ",
