            "answer_text": "I don't haggle, don't care to. And if I am buying an instrument -I would not be interested in buying a guitar I could not hold- I pay what is asked, or I walk away. But if it a bit of kit, an amplifier or such, two weeks ago it was a digital recorder, I always check Amazon's price on my phone after I have made the decision. If A is lower, I go ahead and enter the transaction. GC can see the total including freight, and the two times that A has been lower, GC has met the price without any problem. Don't know about straight up horse-trading haggling though. ",

            "answer_text": "For used gear? Of course. They will have paid $x for it and want to sell it for $y. Make a realistic offer. And dont be an %}#%^* about it. Work on the assumption that they paid half of what the asking price is. If it's been in the store for a month or more, they want to get rid of it. Offer 75% of the asking price and allow yourself to be negotiated up to 85%. You just got a 15% discount. New? Not so much, but you can still offer less than their asking price. ",
