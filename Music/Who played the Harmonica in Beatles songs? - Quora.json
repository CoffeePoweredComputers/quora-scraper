            "answer_text": "Q: Who played the Harmonica in Beatles songs? John [1] played most of it, and, as far as I'm aware, he certainly played the most famous harmonica pieces in Beatles' songs. Especially the solo on Love Me Do [2]. I answer more queries about how to play Love Me Do from my customers than any other song, by a very long way indeed. However, John wasn't the only one. According to Wikipedia [3], there were three more: Mal Evans [4] on \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\";George [5] on some of them, though Wiki doesn't say which ones; andRingo [6] on some of them, though again, Wiki doesn't say which ones.While Wiki doesn't tell us which songs were the ones that George and Ringo played on, luckily for us there is someone right here on Quora who will almost certainly know for sure: Todd Lowry. Todd knows more about The Beatles' music than anyone I've ever read before. If you like The Beatles, then follow him! If you're having trouble recalling Beatles songs with harmonica, here's a list of ten of them that may jog your memory: 10 Beatles songs featuring harmonicaWatching this YouTube clip may help as well. While they're not the best covers I've ever heard, Jared Pike sure gets the point across:  Jared also lists the following as all The Beatles' songs with harmonica on them:  He adds this interesting addendum as well:  Footnotes[1] John Lennon - Wikipedia[2] Love Me Do - Wikipedia[3] List of people who performed on Beatles recordings - Wikipedia[4] Mal Evans - Wikipedia[5] George Harrison - Wikipedia[6] Ringo Starr - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "John Lennon played the harmonica and the \u201charp\u201d on Beatles recordings. When John used the word \u201charmonica,\u201d what he meant was a chromatic harmonica (the one with the button), such as the one Stevie Wonder was known for playing. When John used the word \u201charp,\u201d he meant a no-button, diatonic \u201cblues harp,\u201d such as a Hohner Marine Band model. Here\u2019s a list of the harmonicas/harps John played on various songs: \u201cLove Me Do\u201d\u2014a chromatic harmonica in the key of G. \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d\u2014a 12-hole, diatonic Echo Vamper, the European market version of the Marine Band 364, in the key of E. \u201cChains\u201d\u2014a chromatic harmonica in C. \u201cThere\u2019s a Place\u201d\u2014a chromatic harmonica in C. \u201cFrom Me To You\u201d--a 12-hole, diatonic Echo Vamper in the key of C. \u201cThank You Girl\u201d\u2014a G diatonic harp is used. This song is in D, so Lennon is using \u201ccross harp.\u201d In cross harp (used for bluesy tunes) one uses a diatonic harp that is in a key a fourth higher than the key one\u2019s playing in. \u201cI\u2019ll Get You\u201d--a diatonic harp in G. This is cross harp\u2014the song is in D. \u201cI Should Have Known Better\u201d--a C Diatonic harp. The song is in G, so Lennon is using \u201ccross harp.\u201d I\u2019m a Loser\u201d\u2014a C diatonic (also cross harp). \u201cAll Together Now\u201d\u2014a G diatonic harp. \u201cRocky Raccoon\u201d\u2014a C diatonic harp. Finally, a variety of harmonicas and harps were used for the swirling background sound in \u201cBeing For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.\u201d Discographies credit Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Beatles road Manager Neil Aspinall and Road Manager Mal Evans.
