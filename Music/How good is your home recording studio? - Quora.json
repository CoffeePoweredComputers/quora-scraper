            "answer_text": "I think mine is considerably better than average for a part time musician. First and foremost is my space. When my home was being built, I had an outbuilding made specifically for recording. It\u2019s only one room, but it\u2019s 16\u2032 x 23\u2032 with 14\u2032 cathedral ceilings, close to the golden mean. It is built from sand filled cinder blocks that have been stucco\u2019ed. I put up a lot of acoustic treatment, mostly OC703 DIY panels with 2\u2033 wall offsets to lower effective absorption frequencies, resonant bass traps and corner bass traps - all to control reverberations without killing them completely. I have thick curtains for the windows, that can be drawn or exposed depending on the amount of echo I want. The ceiling has bass traps, OC703 panels and a diffusor to eliminate all floor to ceiling parallel surfaces. The sand filled cinderblock provides a lot of isolation from the outside, which is mostly forest anyway. The HVAC system is loud, so I turn it off temporarily when i\u2019m tracking acoustically or listening to monitors. I put a lot of emphasis on my front end. I have a Neumann U-89 mic, a pair of Peluso P12 mics (excellent clones of the AKG C12 tube gems) and a number of dynamic mics. I have five channels of boutique preamps - a Neve clone, a pair of API clones and a stereo pair of Demeter tube preamp channels. I have an LA2A and Pultec clone chain that I normally track through an RNC and dbx 166 compessor as well. And I have 18 channels of analog conversion via my Apogee Symphony I/O. So, while I can\u2019t track a whole band without pulling in a friend\u2019s preamps and mics, I can track up to five separate mics/pres at a time in-house, with pristine results. I monitor off of DynAudio BM15s, Audix 1As and a cheap boom box. I have a tricked out 15\u2033 2011 MacBook Pro that runs Digital Performer as my DAW. I use all its plug ins, plus Native Instruments Komplete and Arturia Classic Synths. I have a nice set of drums and very nice cymbals. I have a vintage Music Man bass amp, a Mesa Boogie DC-2 tube guitar amp and I can run the Music Man through a 12\u2033 speaker for guitar. I have lots of vintage keyboard lying around from my pre-digital days. This is more than enough equipment for me to learn the craft of recording my own material and that of my music friends. Next upgrades include: Dedicated kick mic, more preamps, a nice stereo 1176 clone and perhaps a couple more dynamic mics so I can track a full set of drums and a bass player. I\u2019m very lucky to have this space. I\u2019m retiring as an IT professional in a couple years, so I hope to keep busy in my studio. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm quiet satisfied with my home studio recording considering the fact that most of my equipments I use is not that expensive and I get the satisfactory results out. All you need is a good laptop(i3 and above), a DAW(I prefer cubase), a condenser microphone(I use Samson C01), a decent pair of headphones for monitoring(sennhiesers), a guitar/keyboard (midi \u2026), a guitar processor and few vst as per your requirement (EQ or post processing, drums etc.. stock plugins of cubase will do the job though) This is an example of how my home studio recording sounds like\u2026  Enjoy ",
