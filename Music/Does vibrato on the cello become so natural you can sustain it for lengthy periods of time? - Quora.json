            "answer_text": "More than that, it becomes a sort of reflex that you fine-tune to particular sounds and frequencies without actively thinking about it. You\u2019ll note when learning vibrato that you frequently find yourself in situations where the vibrato gets in the way of what you\u2019re trying to do with your hand other than vibrato. For this reason, students are first encouraged to do vibrato on long notes, but teachers tend to look the other way on the short ones. Eventually, this grace period ends and your teacher starts asking you to do the seemingly impossible. \u2026But at that point, you\u2019ve had a year or two of experience doing vibrato on long notes, and it turns out that doing vibrato on short notes is the same, just either faster or fewer \u201citerations.\u201d Your teacher will start saying annoying things like \u201cdon\u2019t ramp up the vibrato, start full tilt!\u201d It will feel impossible, but you\u2019ll get it eventually, even though you won\u2019t be really sure why they\u2019re asking for it in places where it seems like you have plenty of time to ramp up. From there, you\u2019ll learn to control vibrato on \u201cruns\u201d - where you\u2019ll realize that you no longer have time to ramp up at all. Eventually you stop thinking about it altogether, it just happens. Automatically. All the time. You\u2019ll be able to decide whether you\u2019re ramping up or not (different sound each way) and whether you\u2019re tailing off or not. You\u2019ll feel like the bestest cellist ever. \u2026And then your teacher will do something supremely annoying. They\u2019ll say \u201cgreat! Now do that again\u2026 without vibrato.\u201d ",
