            "answer_text": "Actually, OVO is Drake's label.  When he releases things that are just him, all the royalties for that album's sales go to his label. He then wears the Record Label hat and the Artist hat and collects a royalty for all record sales and pays himself as the Artist based on the artist agreement percentage from the net sales.
