            "answer_text": "I would like to start by saying ALL of them are popular, and no I am not being diplomatic, Yoongi\u2019s MT had more hype than Lady Gaga and Ariana\u2019s song the day it was released, BTS would outsell an entire brand just because they were spotted somewhere near it, if they\u2019re not the most popular thing on this planet then I don\u2019t know what is Now, let\u2019s talk about popularity ranks Obviously there\u2019s no way to determine who is the most popular BTS member, it depends more on the region or the country Jungkook and Jimin are the most popular members in Korea Hoseok in South America Taehyung is in China, middle east and Japan So, I hop you get the point, the ranking differs, if we\u2019re talking about official rankings tho, I would tell you it goes like this 1.Taehyung2.Jungkook 3.Jimin4.Yoongi5.Jin6\u20137 Hoseok and RM I know a lot of people would say it\u2019s actually Jungkook or Jimin who are the most popular members, but I will state the obvious, in 2019 an official Russian magazine stated the ranking numbers according to sales, searched names, bt21 figures sales, YT streams, Spotify, Sound Cloud, tweeter, facebook and random surveys,to which Taehyung was named first ( I don\u2019t remember the exact percent but I think Taehyung was 19% or 16%, if someone remembers please comment) Now, I would like to point out that all the maknae line are very popular, and the members ranking could change this year, but according to one-times votes poll I don\u2019t think it changed much, but again there\u2019s no official way to confirm it in 2020 until an official statement is released by a reliable source Back to your question, Yoongi is popular, very popular in both BTS and as an idol in general but according to numbers he\u2019s not the most popular member and he\u2019s less than Jungkook. That doesn\u2019t change however that our little meow meow is the most adorable thing in the world, or change how amazing any of them are ",
