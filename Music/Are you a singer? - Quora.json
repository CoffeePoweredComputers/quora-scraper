            "answer_text": "Yes I am. I plan to have it as a profession. I am in a choir and an opera program at a university called Stetson. I am studying voice as a tenor (might end up singing spinto tenor and dramatic tenor roles) that sings in the bass I section of a touring choir. Most of my choir time I usually sang tenor II and could sometimes manage tenor I . I began singing in my senior high school as a baritone but did sing in the tenor sections of other choirs of my high school. I believe being vocalist is a better choice than being an instrumentalist in my taste, though my musicianship from elementary school to high school was spent on the clarinet. I define myself practicing and performing as a singer who can be cast in operas and musicals, not playing the clarinet or any other instrument down in the pit. If not music I would also be doing digital arts which I do not define myself as. That\u2019s why I want more singing skills and luck to get to do it as a profession since that\u2019s what define myself as. Here are samples of me singing in a choir, a solo performance, and a role in an opera.    ",

People express their emotions through songs , few sing out of joy , few out of sorrow , few sing for themselves , few for their loved ones and few for every other. When it comes to me , I am not a professional singer nor has performed ever. But yes , I sing a lot ,but only to myself , when I get emotionally attached to a song I sing it whenever I hear it/ it runs in my mind. This mostly happens with a break up song (soup songs , later I came to know (although I don't know if it's correct )) and also an inspirational one or a pop song. Genuine feedback is appreciated. :) ",

Im realy lucky to have a voice that people found solace in(thats basicaly how I have always used this gift of god.. for helping others) without any kind of training. So yes indeed am a singer but until now Im just a 'bathroom singer'. Thats what I always call myself. Thnx for the question. ",

I would have liked to have it as a profession, but unfortunately, life circumstances force me to have it as a hobby only. I still love to do it and it still what defines me, not the job of answering to phone calls all day\u2026 I\u2019m proud of my voice but really wish I wasn\u2019t so poor and stuck with my time schedule to be able and do more about it. Anyway, I will never stop loving to sing. And that what matters the most. ",
