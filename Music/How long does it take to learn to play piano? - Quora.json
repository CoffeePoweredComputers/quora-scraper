            "answer_text": "Took 15 years to be decent. Through many many tears, from a hobby to Carnegie to Italy to teenage angst, piano has been my life and I honestly don\u2019t know what life would be without music and my incredible teachers. I started at 3: experimenting I loved music. We played classical nonstop in the house, and my older sister played, and I wanted to do what she could do. Everyday, I would watch her practice if she let me (sometimes I\u2019d be too distracting), and when she\u2019d finish, I\u2019d hop on and play around on the piano. At 3, I learned what music was. Age 4: notes I officially began lessons after begging my parents. I never knew this growing up, but my mom never thought I would ever amount to anything with piano so she just let me do whatever I wanted with the keys and lessons. I was hurt when I learned this, but I know for a fact that if my parents had pushed this instrument onto me, I would not have grown to love it the way I do today. Also, I was a really fidgety child, so understandable but still hurtful. At this age, I learned notes and where they fit on the keys. Age 5\u20137: hobby During this time, I learned keys and random songs. My teacher was this incredible Slovic grandmother who had graduated from a top music conservatoire in Russia (USSR at the time) and escaped the USSR to America. She believed that a student must enjoy and feel the sounds of music, and I grew up being really hippie about music. Like 7-year-old me being like \u201cmooomm you just gotta feeel the music, you know?\u201d while I was literally playing pieces like \u201cCuckoo Mouse on the Wall\u201d or some random Sonatina. I just did school talent shows and recitals. At this point, I didn\u2019t really understand music. I just knew it sounded pretty if I played right. I learned how to play with both hands smoothly at once and how to play so my arms and wrists don\u2019t hurt. I learned music theory, history, and chord progressions: the fundamentals of music and piano. Age 8: a part of me I entered my first piano competition at 8. It was lit. I practiced like an hour a day as a fidgety 8-year-old. (That was a lot for a kid who spent most of her time outside doing bike tricks off ramps with the squad.) I remember the results of my first piano competition. My teacher forgot to tell my mom my result and only told her my sister\u2019s, so I assumed I lost and cried. This was the first time I had cried due to complete sadness. This was also when my dad had realized what piano really meant to me and became my strongest supporter in music, but because of his job, he had to go abroad and it was really hard on me. This is the age when I realized piano was part of my identity. Music was literally another limb on my body and it was my pride. Turns out, I had gotten second, which was really exciting for me, but since then, I fell deep into piano. Age 9: a teacher that would change my life After my first competition, I moved cities, which meant I needed a new teacher. This is when I met Dr. Lee. She had graduated at the top pre-college music conservatoire in South Korea and came to America to get degrees at the Eastman School of Music. We mainly went to this teacher for my sister; my mom still didn\u2019t believe I was going to be any good at music. She encouraged me to play soccer and cheer, which I loved, but piano was now one of my limbs. She was going to have to painfully chop it off of me. My professor saw something in me that no one around me had since my dad lived abroad. She saw a passion and a talent in me, which she was determined to foster and to this day I respect and love her so much for her guidance. My sister\u2019s sophomore year of high school, she won first and concert recitalist in the state competition, which was the highest piano honor in our state. Then, she quit since she had won something for college apps, which meant our professor had more time for me when she wasn\u2019t lecturing!! Age 10\u201311: visual passion I did okay in competition. I won here and there, but I honestly played for fun. Then, 6th grade I played the first movement to \u201cThe Children\u2019s Corner\u201d by Claude Debussy and fell in love. I was mesmerized by Debussy\u2019s work, and to this day, he is my favorite composer. His music is quite easy to fall in love with due to his smooth, exquisite melodies. Music, for the first time, meant something more to me than a melody. I began to picture colors and paintings. Absolutely breathtaking for me as a student and young musician. Music was now something more than fun. It was my heart. That extra limb that was music was my heart. Age 12: talent I like to say age 12 was one of my life\u2019s peaks. That year, my professor was livid that I had lost my state competition. Honestly, I was pissed too. I played \u201cGolliwog\u2019s Cakewalk\u201d by Debussy ( of course lmao ) and some Beethoven Sonata. The thing is, it was the most musically I had ever performed to that date, so I was really confused. (We later found out that the judge had been bribed. Our state competitions and piano moms are intense lol.) Also, this was when my mom finally told me she believed that I wasn\u2019t really that talented anyway. \u201cYou only really do this for fun, so it\u2019s okay Sophia! I bet other kids practiced for hours and hours. You don\u2019t have to be good.\u201d She had the best intentions, but it was god awfully hurtful. Anyway, my professor thought these competitions were a load of BS and that my true talent would only be recognized elsewhere. But, that was not what she told me back then. She told my family and me that we were going to make a fun recording for a small competition. She was really vague about the details. Again, my mom never thought I was talented, so she didn\u2019t really push anything. (Can you tell I\u2019m salty about this yet? Hahaha! Regardless, she\u2019s the best mom ever for supporting me even with her doubts.) So, for about a month, I practiced about 4\u20135 hours every. single. day. Even longer on weekends. I was just so motivated by how pissed I was. I know, bad motivation, but every time I would get tired and stop, I\u2019d just get pissed that my mom didn\u2019t believe I had talent, so I\u2019d just keep going until I felt like I did, which was never. Until\u2026 One day, I get home and my mom has a cake on the table that says, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d. Ecstatically, she hands me the phone. It\u2019s my professor on the other line: \u201cSophia, how would you like to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City this summer?\u201d My eyes inundated with tears of happiness. I was so confused. I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. She had entered me into the American Protege International Piano Competition, and I had won first recitalist. My mom and I began screaming, and we\u2019re both crying. Wow. What a moment. For the next 2\u20133 months, my professor and I practiced to perfect the piece to how I wanted it to sound, and somehow, my professor knew exactly what that was. Using our minds together, we had created the epitome of Debussy. As haughty as that sounds, it really was so perfect. I understood every single note, crescendo, accidental, chord, rest in that piece. To this day, I have never understood a piece the way I did that Debussy piece. My performance. Performing at Carnegie Hall is \u2014 for us normal kids \u2014 a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I remember sitting on the bench and suddenly, everything went dark. I could only see my hands and the keys. It\u2019s like all my senses had shut off to focus on music and only music. I had become possessed by fervor. I remember looking up at the hall after the concert thinking to myself, \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d I never did. Coming home, I was the neighborhood hot shot. The Protege. I remember kids would try to pretend to be my friend because of my clout. This was because my mom had put my win in our school\u2019s announcements. Oh my god. I remember turning into a hot tomato when it came on because I had no idea that was going to happen. I nearly passed out with embarrassment, but after a while, it was pretty cool. And so\u2026 Age 13: cocky I became cocky and I SUCKED because I played for the wrong intentions and never practiced. That\u2019s it lmao Age 14\u201316: emotional passion, getting my life together, and traveling I had finally realized that my cocky-ass was not getting anywhere, so I began actually practicing again, which made my professor so happy, but I moved schools again and I no longer had any piano clout, which was like fine. I didn\u2019t really care. But tbh, school was just hard. I didn\u2019t really find my real friends until senior year, so life was difficult because I never felt like I belonged anywhere. However, as a result, piano became my escape. It was my place to be alone and be emotional. It was very therapeutic to practice, so I ended up practicing for hours on end, which led me to be selected to attend this international competition and festival abroad in Italy, which was totally awesome! I was so psyched to go. For two weeks, I was surrounded by musicians of all types who were as passionate as I was. Most of the kids were in conservatoire or college for music, so it was an even more incredible experience! I won this duet competition while I was there but not the entire competition, which was fine because the masterclasses were incredible and I just learned so much from everyone, including the top professors from around the world. I won a lot of competitions after this because I had just developed my pieces so much in Italy, so I ended up traveling to France, New York, China, and honestly all over America to perform, which was really cool! Age 16: oof This was a really bad time for me. I think my rebellious age hit late because I was realllllyyyy rebellious my junior year of high school. Sorry Mom and professor. Ahaha This meant I never practiced and just did nothing all the time unless it was school-related. Yeah\u2026 I got merked by competitions, and this time, no one got bribed. Age 17\u201318 AKA Today! My senior year, I calmed down with competitions and only did two. I did really well in both, and it was exciting. I honestly played more for myself than for performance purposes. I was just really finalizing who I was as a person before college. That\u2019s when I received offers from the Manhattan School of Music and Columbia\u2019s music school. Well, it wasn\u2019t automatic admission, but professors from both school\u2019s who I had encountered during competitions and festivals strongly encouraged me to apply and told me I had a very high chance of getting in *winky winky*, so\u2026 basically. But, that would mean I would have to pursue music in undergraduate for sure, and out of fear, I bailed. Didn\u2019t go. Didn\u2019t even apply. Looking back, do I regret this? 100000%. There\u2019s nothing in my life that I regret more than not pursuing music. I remember my first weekend of college sitting on the phone with my parents and just crying. Just waterfalls of tears of regret. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love college, but I really do wish I had taken the opportunity to go beyond just being decent at music. That\u2019s my story. ",

            "answer_text": "I would think a very, VERY long time, unless you can read music and know a little music theory. Using myself as an example, I taught myself guitar and clarinet. Being a piano player well versed in reading and theory, it was easy for me as music is a universal language on every instrument. If I didn\u2019t know music theory I would have wound up to the \u201cput your hand here\u201d strategy, which is not educational at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, as an instructor when a student first starts playing piano it is the \u201cput your hand here\u201d strategy, but it\u2019s also guided. I can explain to my students (slowly) how to read music and focus on their weaknesses. If someone who isn\u2019t at least moderately trained in music attempts to teach themselves and instrument it will be very limited knowledge, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate with other musicians easily. Singing is the best example of this. When I was in college, the vocal majors invariably never read a lick of music, and the instrumentalists could sight read better than they could. Why? because the vocal majors were trained mostly by ear. This is why when I teach vocals, I teach sight singing as well as basic music theory. Many times I\u2019ve worked with vocalists who cannot communicate with me because they don\u2019t know anything about musical form, theory, etc. It also depends on what you want to learn. If you want to learn how to play Rachmaninoff from square one (knowing nothing) I doubt someone could do that on their own without guidance. But if you wanted to learn pop music and \u201cput your hand here\u201d (i.e. YouTube videos) you may be able to practically play the piano, but you\u2019ll have no idea what you\u2019re doing and won\u2019t be useful to other musicians without musical knowledge (i.e. music reading, theory, knowing scales).
