            "answer_text": "Try playing the melody of a spooky song/melody that you\u2019ve heard with your right hand on piano. Then use the following process (described below) to work out the chord progressions for each song. Or, you can simply play random progressions of minor chords to create a creepy sounding tune and play on your right hand any notes that fall into the current key (determined by the current root note ) you are playing.. How to identify the bass notes (and chords) when playing a song/melody on the piano: Identify the melodic note you are about to play on the main down beat of the song and immediately locate and play the bass note at 1, 3 or 5 intervals BELOW the melodic note.Form MINOR chords from notes 1-3-5 or 1\u20135\u20138\u201310 intervals ABOVE each bass note.See more details below in my diagram and my YouTube video below.   More details on how to match right hand melody to left hand chords at\u2026 Allan Jeong's answer to Is jazz harder than classical? ",

            "answer_text": "Any series of minor chords that depend upon chromaticism. For example: E min 7, E min 6, E min b6 Think of this as basically an E minor chord, with the notes e g b and a descending line of D, Db, C. Any chord progression that uses a series of diminished chords. Any melody that uses the tritone: C to F#. Finally, remember that all emotional responses to music are completely dependent upon the era of history, the culture, even what kind of instrument is being played. The Theramin ( Think the Beach Boys \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d) always sounds spooky to me no matter what is being played, partially because of the sound and partially because of the way a person looks when they waive their hands around a steel rod.
