            "answer_text": "So a very valid question. As we all know \u201cShawshank\u201d refers to the name of the prison. The word redemption means - when all of a sudden you fall down from a level, you try to reach back to your orginal level (also called the process of rising) until u finally rise and reclaim your position. Now why redemption :- In the context of this movie, Andy duffrense finds himself entangled in a series of events which he never committed and which leads to two-life sentences in the Shawshank. Being a hotshot banker in the outside, he finds himself in the most miserable place one could ever imagine. Still he struggles ,makes friends, obey friendship and with his continual efforts, constructs a library in the Shawshank prison. Meanwhile he always regrets that he could have saved his wife and lead a normal life and wishes to visit the pacific the day he gets out. After learning the level of dirty politics being played by Warden Norton and his deputy, he realizes he doesn't belong here. Thereafter follows a chain of events and ultimately the night comes when he breaks the prison. So at the end it is all about hope game. He hopes that one day he will get out and make his way to the pacific & so he does. This is how he found his way of redemption. But along with his break, he also succeeded in drawing the attention of the authorities against the wrongdoings of Warden Norton beneath the table. So it is at the end both Andy's as well as the Shawshank prison's redemption. A very wonderful movie to watch. Shaswat ",
