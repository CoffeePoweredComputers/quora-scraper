            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s no competition: J. S. Bach. Here are a few reasons why: In my opinion, music is equal parts technique and expression; in other words, the best music isn\u2019t just that which is technically perfect or expressively rich, but both. Obviously, your personal mileage may vary, but for my money, no composer did both as well as, or melded the two together better than, J. S. Bach. For example, let\u2019s turn to the \u201cCrucifixus\u201d and \u201cEt Resurrexit\u201d sections of the B Minor Mass. These two sections, one right after the other, are intended to portray the absolute extremes of human emotion \u2014 despair and suffering on one hand; joy and exuberance on the other \u2014 and wow, do they ever! This is remarkable on its own, but the fact that the music is also so technically perfect, that it holds up so well to analysis, makes it even more so.Bach was a devout Lutheran, and much of his music (even his instrumental music) can be linked back to his Christian faith. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting that you need to be a person of faith to appreciate Bach \u2014 the late Douglas Adams was an extreme atheist (his term), and he adored Bach\u2019s music \u2014 but I am saying that, as a Christian, I feel a particular kinship to Bach and his work.Two personal recollections: Before I ever started composing, I was a percussionist, and when I was in high school, my (rather unorthodox) percussion teacher suggested that I pick up a copy of Glenn Gould\u2019s 1955 recording of Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations. I was instantly hooked, and I listened to that recording for months on end. Also, I will never forget the first time I listened to the opening \u201cKyrie\u201d from the B Minor Mass. I was following along with the score, and I couldn\u2019t help but weep, because I knew I was listening to the most beautiful music I had ever heard. If not for these two run-ins with the music of Bach, I don\u2019t know that I would be a composer. For that reason, if no other, I am indebted to Bach.I could go on, but you get the idea. My point is that Bach is my favorite composer not only because of the ridiculously high quality of his music, or because of its expressive power, or because of my personal connections to it, but for all of those reasons combined.

            "answer_text": "My favorite composer, and I\u2019m sure many would agree with me, is Ludwig Van Beethoven. Beethoven was a German-Classical composer who lived between the years 1770\u20131827. What makes Beethoven\u2019s many compositions so breathtakingly spectacular is not only the many dynamic contrasts and musical complexity they exhibit, but the heavy emotional weight they carry. Unknown to many, a great deal of Beethoven\u2019s arrangements reflect the complex feelings he was experiencing at the time of their composition. An excellent example of Beethoven\u2019s emotional investment in his music is evident in his composition of the well-known \u201cMoonlight Sonata.\u201d This sonata was not composed thoughtlessly, but with Beethoven\u2019s pupil Giulietta Guicciardi in mind. Beethoven\u2019s infatuation and love for Guicciardi is evident in the emotional intensity of the piece. Another prime example of Beethoven\u2019s emotional investment in his music is evident in his \u201cPastoral Symphony.\u201d This composition contains five movements, each with a different feeling. The first movement reflects Beethoven\u2019s feelings as he first arrives in the country, the second movement encapsulates the sound of flowing water, the third movement paints the image of country folk dancing, the fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, and the fifth (and final) movement represents the humble sheperds\u2019 song of thanksgiving. Beethoven\u2019s musical genius is clear from these few examples. His emotional intensity and attention to music make him my favorite composer. ",
