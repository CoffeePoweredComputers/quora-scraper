            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that a wired headphone\u2019s drivers are powered by an amplifier which supplies the voltage and current necessary to move them.

An iPod or mobile phone\u2019s built-in amp may be adequate, but many users prefer a separate unit specifically made for the purpose. ",
