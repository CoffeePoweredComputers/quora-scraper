Materials 1. glass cleaning spray 2. a wide soft brush (3 inches) 3. deionized water 4. liquid soap 5. an old towel 6. a 100% cotton cloth \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 a) Put one inch (3 cm) of deionized water in a basin that will fit the record. b) Spread the towel on a table and put the record on. Spray the side that is visible and do not be afraid of the label in the center - but not spray there. c) Make circular movements with the brush (10 times). Turn the record upside down and repeat. d) Rinse the record in the tap with cold water. e) Use a little liquid soap and spread it with your hand on the wet record (it will become soapy). f) Rinse the record again. g) Dip the record into the basin with the deionized water. h) With the cotton cloth, gently wipe the label and then, with circular movements, dry the record. i) Leave the record upright until the label is completely dry. You can hear it (after cleaning the needle with isopropyl alcohol on the brush. Be careful once every 10 days or every day dry). ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest just a good, thorough cleaning. That may or may not actually make them \u201cshine like they\u2019re brand new\u201d, but it should help the sound quality by removing dirt and particles. There are many different methods for doing this, everything from distilled water with a small bit of dish soap to a Spin Clean (what I have) to very expensive automatic cleaners; I would suggest doing a search for one that will suit you best.
