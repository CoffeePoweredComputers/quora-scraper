Taehyung, Eunwoo, Taeyong, Lucas\u2026 The possibilities are endless. Personality- Personally for me, it\u2019s Haechan NCT   Female K-POP Idol Dance- Hyolyn  Vocal- Ailee  Rapping- CL  Visuals- Literally any group\u2019s visual like Irene, Tzuyu, Jisoo, Nana\u2026 The possibilities are endless. Personality- I prefer Jessi\u2019s personality. You either like it or you don\u2019t.  I was searching up \u2018Best K-POP\u2026\u2019. I was looking at the lists and found out that for vocals, legit BTS was ranked first. Now I not trying to hate on them or anything. They have amazing vocals, but far from the best. For dancing, Jimin was first, but like \u2018huh?\u2019 For rapping, it would be understandable how they would be some of the best rappers in K-POP. Same thing goes for Black Pink. Lisa and Jennie are not the best rappers in K-POP. Their vocal line is not the best in K-POP. Lisa\u2019s dancing may be amazing, but in comparison to people like Chunga, Hyolyn, and Chaeyeong, I think tf not. I guess it all comes down to opinion, but\u2026",
