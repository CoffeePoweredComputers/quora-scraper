            "answer_text": "It depends on the company. SM generally picks the leader based on age or the length of traineeship, this means that either it is the oldest member out of the group that gets to be the leader or the one who trained the longest. For example, Red Velvet's Irene is the group's leader and its oldest member while Suho from EXO is the group's leader because he had the longest traineeship even though Xiumin is older than him. Super Junior's leader Leeteuk is also the oldest member in the group. On the other hand, YG doesn't really care for age when it comes to picking the leader. YG group leaders are picked on the basis of their ability to compose, write, produce and for their musical talents as a whole. For example, Yoon is the maknae and leader of WINNER and B.I isn't the oldest in iKON either yet he's the leader. Same goes for Big Bang G.D. So yep, it is indeed possible for a member to hold the maknae and leader title in a K-pop group but it depends on the company. I think SM is more strict & traditional when it comes to assigning roles such as centre, leader, dancer, visual and maknae etc but a company such as YG doesn't really like to label its artists that way or put them in a box.

            "answer_text": "From what I know there has never been a time when a company knowingly made the maknae the leader. However for one group this came unintentionally. That is Winner. Winner, after going through WIN:Who is next?, a surrvial program which they won over iKON, had 5 members: Seunghoon, Jinwoo, Seungyoon, Mino and Taehyun. Mino was the first leader of Winner. However, after injury, Seungyoon(the second youngest) took over as leader. However later, Taehyun left due to mental health issues and that made Seungyoon the maknae and leader of Winner. From what I know, his leadership skills are good, but people don\u2019t talk about them as much as GD, CL, or Hanbin/B.I\u2019s proabably because he is the maknae and age matters a lot in Korean culture. This is very unlikely to happen again, although YG is known for having leaders who are not the oldest or the most trained but the people who naturally become the leader. Like for iKON, Hanbin was never told he was the leader but it naturally evolved and I think similar cases occurred for GD and BigBang and CL and 2NE1. But still, based on the current trainees, I don\u2019t think any maknaes can become the leader since YG has huge age gaps(The oldest trainee is a 98 liner and the youngest is an 05). And I don\u2019t think their are many other companies who lets the leader be the person who becomes the leader, rather the oldest or the most trained. ",

Heesun left PF in October 2019 due to depression and anxiety, which made Arang the maknae. In April 2020, Mydoll Ent. announced that Aini would be leaving PinkFantasy due to plantar fascilitis (feet problems) and left the leader position open. In Mydoll\u2019s statement regarding Aini, they said the following: \u201c[Arang] has been chosen as the member of PinkFantasy to succeed Aini as leader. Arang may be the youngest member of the team, but not only has she been with us since the beginning, but we have decided there will be no shortage of responsibility and trust from the members with Arang as leader.\u201d (translation: ppaliwabwaa on twitter) So, even though it seems almost unthinkable, Arang became the maknae and the leader!

The one that comes to mind although he is technically not the maknae but he's younger than every other group member is Zico. He's second youngest and the leader of Block B. Given his personality and the other group members personalities it worked out well for them. We will just have to wait and see if any group comes out and the maknae is the leader! That'll be fun to watch! ",

And he actually wasn\u2019t initially the maknae of the group, Nam Tae-hyun was, but he left the group not long after debut. As far as I know, Leadership has seniority over age so he does in fact lead the group and the members do treat and respect him as the leader. ",

Taeyeon said that Seohyun (who is the maknae of SNSD) acted as the leader when they were promoting as TTS and Tiffany said that it was because she\u2019s been following them for years so it was \u201cSeohyun\u2019s time now\u201d. That was pretty interesting because Taeyeon\u2019s the leader of SNSD so people assumed she\u2019d lead them. So yeah, I guess a maknae could lead if they have the respect of the members and enough knowledge. ",
