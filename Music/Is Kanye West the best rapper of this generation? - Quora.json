            "answer_text": "Yes, this is a no brainer. He has arguably the best discography of all-time as far as rap goes. His albums generally receive exemplary reviews from critics & the public.He\u2019s one of the more creative rappers of all-time. During the early years of his career he gave a new, distinctive, and innovative perspective on rap. He covered things out of the norm for that time period in the mainstream spotlight. He also isn\u2019t confined by a specific sub-genre or sound, he makes\u2026music.Kanye has influenced countless artists of the new generation & has become a household name (including Drake & Cole).Many sources regeard him as one of the top live performers in rap today.He\u2019s been relevant for well over a decade, which is hard to do in the rap game. For the most part he\u2019s showing no signs of regression.Note: You don\u2019t have to be a master lyricist to be considered one of the greatest, there\u2019s more to hip-hop than that. Even so, Kanye is considered to be one of the best writers of the past 2 decades. ",

            "answer_text": "No. In this generation hell no. The man was genius back in the early 2000s. Worldwide hits and at the time. If there were interviews he only discussed about the music and the craft. Now he\u2019s in a place where people don\u2019t see him as an artist or a rapper, they see him more as a dumb ass, because of his act of support in Trump. He exploited himself by his unusual behavior between that and paparazzi. Recently he\u2019s been quiet about politics and more spiritual, because he sees that him being a black individual supporting someone who doesn\u2019t treat minorities equally in this country has effected his reputation. But if he didn\u2019t get criticized for it, he would still be Trump\u2019s puppet and I still think he is. ",
