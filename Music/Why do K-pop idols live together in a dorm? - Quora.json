            "answer_text": "They\u2019re gonna spend a lot of time together. Of course as a group, they\u2019ll be going to interviews, performances, TV show appearances, and such together. It would be a huge hassle to have to pick each member up from their own home or meet up somewhere, especially with groups as big as Seventeen or Girls\u2019 Generation. If they live together, they can leave together and go together places.To get used to each other, probably. They should learn to get along with their group members, so that there\u2019s not so much tension, but I can see how living together can also increase tension because they would be together all the time. But if they live separately and only see each other during performances, that wouldn\u2019t help with their bonding either.A lot of idols aren\u2019t from Seoul, so where would they live anyway? They can\u2019t commute all the way from their hometown especially when some of them are from Jeolla-do province or from overseas. And I doubt they could afford their own apartment in Seoul. Their company could give them their own places, but that\u2019s still expensive. It\u2019s cheaper to put them together in a dorm.The company can keep an eye of them. You probably know that K-Pop idols have limited freedom. Having the members live together in a dorm can make it easier for the company to make sure that no scandals or anything happen and that the members don\u2019t do anything that they don\u2019t want them to do.However, after a while when idols have earned enough money, a lot of them move out of the dorms and get their own places, or split up a little bit. Or if I\u2019m not mistaken, they still have a dorm together but some members might buy their own home on the side to go home to if the group doesn\u2019t have anything going on and they don\u2019t need to go home to the dorm.

            "answer_text": "It is easier for company to manage them. Imagine if you have schedules with all the members and all of them live separately, you would have to drive around different areas just to pick them up. There are idols who are not from Seoul as well. Where else will they live if not in a dorm? Another reason might be for the group to get closer to each other. Living together is the fastest way to get closer. By doing so, the members get to know each other more and can look out for each other during their schedules instead of just working with a known stranger. ",
