Movica This software is in essence a user interface for other open source tools that are somewhat user unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats. The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.  Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good. 8. Weenysoft Video Joiner This is another of the very simple program that just does the one thing, join video files. It does that one task very well though, it has a very nice interface, performs the task quickly and is very easy indeed to use, even for a beginner to video editing.

Great little program that joins video files quickly and easily, not as many compatible file formats as some. 9.

            "answer_text": "The reason is an in-built technology of Final Cut Pro. Every professional video editing software has own codecs. We are using this Codec concept for Offline & Online Editing process, otherwise called Proxy Workflow. For example, Avid Media Composer has DN*HD Codec. Similarly, FCP has ProRes Codec. ProRes codec is developed by Apple. If you want to edit video in FCP. Your video must want to be in ProRes otherwise they will automatically convert your video on ProRes when import to FCP. After the edit, you can easily export your video on ProRes Codec. But Officially in windows, we couldn\u2019t export videos on ProRes. Likely we have alternate with third-party plugins called \u201cProres on Windows\u201d. But this plugin has some lacking like image quality issues, Don\u2019t offer support, Errors, Etc. So only FCP only available on MAC. ",
