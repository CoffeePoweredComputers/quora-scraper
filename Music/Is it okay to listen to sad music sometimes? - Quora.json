            "answer_text": "Yes. It's good for the soul to let the emotions out once in a while & cry. It's part of the grieving process & the official song for Grieving Gracefully is Dolly Parton's Crippled Bird\u2014one of the most amazing pieces of music ever written or recorded. The orchestration is exquisite and matches the song's words & her voice perfectly. Her voice is the perfect vehicle for this song; it quavers & breaks just like a broken soul. It is sweet & quiet in spots just like a innocent soul beset by life's problems & in spots Soars like an eagle over the earth conquering all life can throw at it before quieting back down to a quiet shriveling sad introspectiveness. Sad introspective slow music is my fovorite & I listen to it 95% of the time. I'm not a serial killer so it must be ok to listen to :) ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it is! There are many different generes of music and each one can make us having certain emotions and not everyone gets the same feeling as another person for the same song. Yes some people listen to sad music when their sad, but that isn\u2019t always the case. I\u2019ve listened to sad music if I just like the song. ",
