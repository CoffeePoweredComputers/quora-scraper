            "answer_text": "1- Freddie Mercury Freddie Mercury was a Zanzibari-brought into the world British artist of Indian drop, lyricist, and record maker, known as the lead vocalist and musician of the British song band Queen. He likewise got acknowledged for his flashy stage persona and four-octave. Simply envision his flawless, splendid character, his sweet, comical inclination and is charming, one of a kind voice. He is the icon of an entire bundle of now dearest performers like Lady Gaga. Freddie Mercury is the best vocalist and artist ever. Why? That is because he possesses an extraordinary voice that cannot be recreated. The most unique and most lovely voice that has ever graced this world. There is no vocalist previously, or after him that I could think about that can sing the tune \u201cThe Show Must Go On\u201d or \u201cWho Wants to Live Forever.\u201d What makes him so exceptional is outside my ability to comprehend. Feasibly it\u2019s his tone, or perhaps it is his inflection. Whatever it will be, it is the most astonishing thing at any point recorded, and no one will ever retain the option to pull it off. 2- Michael Jackson Michael Joseph Jackson was one of the best American singers male of the entire entertainment history, artist, and lyricist born on 29th August 1958 in Gary, Indiana, and died on 25th June 2009. He gave (in any event) an astounding 500,000,000 dollars to philanthropy. Michael is called The King of Pop (a title given to him by Elizabeth Taylor). Nobody is giving MJ a compassion vote\u2026 Is it true that you are insane? Anybody saying something to that effect doesn\u2019t have the foggiest idea what an astonishing extent he had. He had great control over his voice. His vocal range was a 4 octave. He possessed an incredible vibrato and sang across pretty much every genre of music. It is something for which he is known. It\u2019s pitiful that some simply don\u2019t realize enough. Yet, remark or just expel him since he was a remarkable artist also, and some way or another, they overlook what he was initially known for, which was singing from an exceptionally young age with the spirit of an accomplished grown-up. The feeling and enthusiasm he sang with were so real and tangible. I am sick of seeing a few people rebate him when he was both a phenomenal artist just as an artist. He was the complete bundle as a craftsman. Because your most loved is another person doesn\u2019t imply that it\u2019s entitlement to put down a craftsman that was an astonishing artist or disregard certainties that have been in proof. Michael Jackson was extraordinary. His passing was horrendous and dismal; however, some state he could even now be alive. He was as yet incredible. Michael Jackson is the best artist on the planet. Most likely about that. Jackson is the best, consistently lord of everything in music. He is dead, so what he is as yet alive in our souls. I am stating to each Michael Jackson fan. Michael Jackson is the best artist of regularly. His name will be recalled ever throughout the entire existence of a considerable number of hundreds of years. His melodies were incredibly nature cherishing and extremely sweet. I concur. Michael Jackson HAS truly fresh melodies. His quality is fantastic. Actually! There truly isn\u2019t anyone around here who is as capable, gifted, assorted, and one of a kind as Michael Jackson. Everything from his elocution to his decisions in when to utilize animosity on his voice versus delicacy (tune in to Butterflies and afterward Scream). His utilization of vocal articulation is unmatched, and he knew accurately what to do and where to do it. If you tune in to Michael\u2019s acapella, you will see that occasionally his pitch can falter; however, the take utilized is immaculate in light of the total articulation. Emotive transport conveyed as if he would genuinely act while he sang (his voice breaking from crying in She\u2019s Out of My Life). His capacity to control his voice was through sheer commitment and work. By and by, he got trained three times each day during top execution lengths by Seth Riggs (a man adored as one of, if not the, most remarkable mentors on the planet) who refers to Michael Jackson as a vocal virtuoso saying that his range alone. Great work, this is, at last, the best I\u2019ve perused it\u2019s everything there summarized richly and altogether wrapped. 3- Elvis Presley Elvis Presley was an American performer and on-screen character. Known as \u201cThe King,\u201d He was generally known for his number 1 singles, including \u201cHound Dog\u201d \u2018\u2018Heartbreak Hotel\u201d \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d \u201cLove me Tender\u201d Elvis appeared in the movie \u201cLove me Tender\u201d and concentrated less on his music and proceeded with that way. I experienced childhood in a group of old-style music darlings. A year ago, I found a station that played only Mr. Presley\u2019s music, including the few takes required to make an ace that fulfilled him, his live shows, and casual accounts of his in-studio and at-home jam sessions. I have never heard anything like Mr. Presley\u2019s voice. Despite everything, I don\u2019t \u201cprefer\u201d all that he sang, yet he has no equivalent among recorded vocalists. He could, and sang anything. At the point when I read that the extraordinary tenor, He was gifted with the voice I wish I had gotten,\u201d I listened somewhat harder. Performers themselves still spot Mr. Presley at the highest point of their arrangements of brilliant vocalists. If you don\u2019t, you haven\u2019t tuned in to the entire body of his work. Straight to the end, Sinatra sang for a long time and recorded three-fold the number of tunes as Mr. Presley did in his inadequate 23 years-vocation. ",
