They are making a comeback in a big way and there are quite a few people that prefer a gramophone over the other commonly used formats including audio CDS which can be called obsolete. There are a lot of people selling players and you can probably find one for yourself quite easily. The uses are many, and the most important is listening to them. :) ",

In some cases that music can\u2019t be reproduced because the masters have been destroyed. The Day the Music Burned. No, they are a source of endless pleasure for their owners. The best use is to listen and enjoy. ",
