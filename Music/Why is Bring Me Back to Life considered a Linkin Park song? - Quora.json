            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not at all a Linkin Park song. Though, from what I remember from reading about it before, at the time when Evanescence was was recording Fallen, their label really wanted them to do something with Linkin Park. Why? Money. We all know that\u2019d be like the absolute biggest thing at the time if that were to happen. Maybe not now, but back when they were starting to establish themselves. Problem: Amy Lee knew Mike & Chester wouldn\u2019t really be into the idea. To them, it would\u2019ve just looked like a move to sell more records, and if you know LP, you\u2019d know that at this time they just wanted to put of most of their stuff on their own. Really they haven\u2019t done much collaboration in the form of a feature, excluding Reanimation, like that until Recharged came out (and even that was another remix album, so \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d for those of you who wanna just follow the studio album chronology). Plus, Meteora, which some say was a \u201cforced album\u201d by the label, was about to come out. I doubt they\u2019d have wanted to take any more pressure from Warner Brothers to do a collaboration with Evanescence at the time. Anyways, sorry if I\u2019m rambling, but you wanna know why people mistakenly associate Bring Me To Life with Linkin Park?  Your good old Budget Mike Shinoda. This is actually Paul McCoy from the band \u201c12 Stones\u201d. Literally never heard of the guy before writing this answer, so I\u2019m not gonna judge him or anything. Hell, I\u2019ll check out 12 Stones write after I submit this. But yeah, people commonly mistake this guy\u2019s parts (\u201cwake me up!\u201d , \u201call of this time, I can\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t see\u201d , etc) for Mike\u2019s rapping. Some people say it sounded like Chester somehow. I don\u2019t see it. Though, I haven\u2019t listened to the song for a while. Anyways, that\u2019s probably why people like to stick Linkin Park\u2019s name in front of the song as a feature or the artist. Honestly, it could help if they bothered to add \u201cFeat. Paul McCoy\u201d when they released it for distribution. This guy probably would\u2019ve gotten a lot more attention. And that\u2019s about all I know on the matter. I\u2019m sure I must be missing some details so if someone knows the whole story and wants me to edit this, I\u2019ll be glad to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "I know, I faced this problem some 3 or 4 years back...and that's how I came across Evanescence, after Linkin Park. Look, I have no idea why on earth \"Bring Me Back to Life\" is tagged with LP, even on YouTube or most sites that support mp3 download. My theory is that perhaps initially there was a confusion, which led to a chain reaction. \"Bring Me Back to Life\" is clearly a song by Evanescence. Some do say that the beats of the song are like those of LP, but that clearly doesn't make any sense!  Such confusions have occurred with other bands and their songs as well, but right now, I can't think of another suitable example. ",
