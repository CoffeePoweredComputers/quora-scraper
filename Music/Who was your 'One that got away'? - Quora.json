            "answer_text": "This was 30 years ago. But it\u2019s a strange long story. I was 15 or 16, and somehow me and my best friend Greg ended up at a pool hall, with his \u201cbrother\u201d Josh. They were not actually related, but their parents were best friends and they had been raised as brothers. If truth be known, they were actually better than best friends, but I was never really the 3rd wheel. It was really more like hanging out with a couple of brothers. So anyway, we\u2019re at this pool hall, and there were a couple of cute sisters whom they both knew from middle school there. And we ended up hanging out with them for a little while. Josh was into the older sister Heather right away, and I didn\u2019t make a habit of being the competitive type so I mostly ignored her. Greg was kinda weird about girls. They all liked him, and he was good looking, but he never really chased girls like me and Josh did. If one of us was interested in a girl, he just kinda left the chasing to us. He really was a great guy, and a great friend. Anyway, so Josh flirted with Heather, and I was flirting with the younger sister Casey that was a year or so younger than us. She kinda seemed into me, so I was stoked! We only got to play a game or two of pool with them, and they had to go. This was during the summer, and a few days later Greg, Josh, and myself were riding around in Greg\u2019s car and he says \u201cI know where Heather and Casey\u2019s mom lives, wanna go see if their there?\u201d And Josh and myself of course said sure! So we drive one town over and show up at their mom\u2019s house, we knock on the door, and sure enough, they are there. Heather answers the door and invites us in. Their mom and step-dad are at work, and pretty quick her and Josh head back to her bedroom. She mentions Casey was in her room, and I should go say hi. (I guess she noticed we\u2019d been flirting at the pool hall, or they talked about it or something) so I knock on the door and Casey opens it. She invited me in and we sat on her bed for awhile, but she wasn\u2019t talking at all really, and it was pretty awkward. She was not being the flirty girl she had been just a few days before at the pool hall. After a few minutes I excused myself, and found Greg out in the living room playing chopsticks on the piano. I joined him, and we goofed around playing piano (neither of us could play really) just wasting time waiting for Josh. Then in burst their step-dad, he had come by during lunch or something and seen Greg\u2019s car in the driveway. He was NOT happy about 3 teen boys being in the house with his two teenage daughters, one of which was in one of their bedrooms!! He threw us out by our ears more or less, and threw in some threats if he ever saw us again. Josh and Heather kinda started seeing each other, but as Casey had given me such a cold shoulder I never really tried hanging with them again. However Greg, Josh and myself hung out all the time. One day about a 2 weeks after the step-dad incident, we head to the lake and do some really stupid stuff that ends up with me having a broken back (cliff jumping). I\u2019m stuck at home for a couple of weeks (was a compound fracture, I could still walk and stuff) when I hear a knock at the door. Realize this was long before cell phones. So I answer and it\u2019s Greg with his new girlfriend Becky whom I\u2019m meeting for the first time, and Josh with Heather. Heather runs up to me, and does one of those jumping-into-your-arms-and-wrapping-your-legs-around-you hugs. While I\u2019d seen her a number of times with Josh over the last month or so, it was kinda strange. And lucky for me she was a tiny thing, but with my hurt back I almost couldn\u2019t hold her. Josh said he had to go to work even before I could invite them in, and he left. Greg and Becky (who\u2019s younger sister I ended up dating for almost 2 years, but that\u2019s another story) pretty much went back and took over my room as soon as I let them in. That left me and Heather hanging out. She was being VERY VERY flirty, and lets just say we went back to my moms room and she made me forget ALL about my back for awhile. I remember asking about Josh, and she told me they were just \u201changing out\u201d and they were not together. To 16 year old me, that was good enough. While I had hung out with Josh a few times during this period he didn\u2019t really talk about his relationships. And I mostly hung out with Greg, and he didn\u2019t talk about it at all. So what the heck. I felt kinda guilty I\u2019ll admit, as I had thought Josh and her were together. But she\u2019s telling me they aren't, and she wasn\u2019t giving me much time to question anything really. Or much cause! As an interesting side note, my mom came home early from work. Everyone was out of the bedrooms, and the girls were in the bathroom fixing their makeup. My mom was not pleased, and while I\u2019m not sure how she knew which of the two I was \u201cwith\u201d she cornered Heather in the bathroom and got in her face and said \u201cIf your dating my son, you better be on birth control!!!!!\u201d Heather looked her straight in the face and said \u201cI am\u201d. Shut my mom down cold!! She didn\u2019t know what to say. She just kind of sputtered out. I guess I should mention here I already had a son at this point. Yes, at 16. The mom was 19. (Don\u2019t judge) I learned over time Heather really didn\u2019t do \u201cserious\u201d or the one-man thing. At least not for long. She was pretty much \u201cwith\u201d whoever she happened to be around at that moment. I did ask Josh about it later, and his feelings about their status was different than hers. But lucky for me he didn\u2019t much care and got over it quickly, and we\u2019re still friends to this day, 30 years later. Heather and I \u201cdated\u201d a few times, but she was always off with another man after a few days to a week later. But from that day on, we had sex more or less every time we saw each other. Becky was her best friend, and as Becky and Greg were dating we saw each other randomly all the time. It was never on purpose or panned. No matter where we were, we found a restroom, a back seat, a unused bedroom, a blanket on the ground, even the front seat of her tiny S10 pickup in a crowed parking lot of the Steak N Shake I worked at while I was on break. Just anywhere and everywhere. Even after Becky and Greg broke up, we would still run into each other a weird amount of times, in totally unexpected ways and places. Side note #2. She always wore button fly jeans and shorts. She didn\u2019t own anything with a zipper. To this day I cannot wear button fly jeans as the act of buttoning them, or more to the point un-buttoning them, turns me on something fierce. It\u2019s like a Pavlov effect. I mean I CANNOT own a pair, it\u2019s too overwhelming. Even 30 years later. If you only knew how many times I took those off her, you might understand. But here is where I have to explain something about Heather and I. While if there was no other choice we engaged in \u201cquickies\u201d, most of the time our intimate encounters lasted hours, I mean like 4 or 6 or 8 hours. During which we never separated. I hate to be graphic but I mean I was IN her the entire time. And we would smoke cigarettes, talk about life, and \u201chang\u201d out like this. I can\u2019t describe it really, but somehow in my whole life those times we were together were the closest I ever felt to another human being. We were too young to really know what the hell we were doing in bed (much to my regret) , but we never stopped from the moment we got alone till we had to separate again. It wasn\u2019t that we did it a bunch of times in a row, we just never stopped. I\u2019ve never had a connection quite like that since. It wasn\u2019t quick and hard then done, it was very slow and and non-stopping. Easy and natural, and deeply deeply intimate. I just had to be in her, and she had to have me in her. Like falling into another person. It was crazy really. But to this day, I\u2019m still awash with the remembrance of that connection. I can\u2019t count the number of times we encountered each other in the early afternoon, and parted finally late at night. We wouldn\u2019t even turn on a light when it got dark outside. People would knock on the door, we\u2019d ignore them. The world spun around us, but we were an island in the storm. Naked and connected. Nothing else mattered. The world melted away, and it was just us. Alone and together. Was it love? Yes, I loved her. And I still have some amazing love notes she wrote me. But she was with someone else days after writing them. But they were amazing, deep, long, and moving letters. Did she love me? The letters would say she did, but we were never \u201ctogether\u201d for more than a week. She always got with someone else. At least she would be honest with me about it. Tell me about it. Weird thing was, I was never too very mad or jealous for too very long. To me she was kind of like a wild animal you couldn\u2019t cage without destroying it\u2019s spirit. I do know she wrote about me in her Diary, I went to her Dad\u2019s house once looking for her (she wasn\u2019t home) and he cornered me in their garage and threatened me. He was a very very quite man normally, in fact this was the first time I\u2019d ever heard him speak. He pretty much told me he\u2019d find me one day and get away with it because he was a cop. He didn\u2019t tell me why. I learned later he\u2019d read her Diary and had grounded her for like a month from what he read about me. Me and no one else. But there were others, many others. But she wrote about me. Only me. Me and Greg grew apart by that winter, still friends, to this day, but we didn\u2019t hang out as much. I got a new \u201cbest friend\u201d named Kent, but Kent ended up going to Heather\u2019s school shortly after I met him cause his parents moved school districts. After Kent left my next \u201cbest friend\u201d was Toad (Josh, but he went by Toad, as in Horny Toad, that was his nickname) Heather would come visit me before school sometimes, and one day Josh thought it would be funny to put his arm around her as I was pulling into school in my car. I hit him with my car. (OK, I was sometimes a LITTLE jealous) I had also introduced Heather and Kent, and as Kent now went to her school they ended up dating. That was mostly OK with me, but Kent resented me something fierce. We had fist fights \u201cover\u201d her. Not fighting FOR her, at least not on my part, but he would get drunk and want to fight me BECAUSE of her. He even tried to stab me one time. He wasn\u2019t a very good friend. They ended up getting married, and having kids together. Last I heard they were still together, and doing con-man work to live or something. That was over 20 years ago last I heard of them. I never understood at the time why Kent grew to hate me so much over Heather. But they were somewhat off again and on again through out high school. Even long after they got together Heather and I would talk on the phone late into the night. One time I remember they were broken up and she said something about how I was \u201cspecial\u201d and she liked me the best of all of them. I laughed and told her I bet she said the same exact things to Kent. She got kinda pissy and told me she\u2019d prove it. She told me to be quite, called Kent on 3-way (still in the land line days) and told him she liked me best, while I was there listening. Looking back now, I suspect she might have said things like that to him I didn\u2019t know about when they were fighting or broken up. So I think I get it now. She may have been kinda evil to him about me. Another point of interest. Remember Casey, the younger sister? I dated her about 4\u20135 years later. Lasted about 2\u20133 months, I lived in another state then, but I\u2019d see her when I came back \u201chome\u201d to visit. She took me home one time, saying she didn\u2019t think her Dad would still remember me. He did. He didn\u2019t say a word, but if looks could kill\u2026 Didn\u2019t last long due to the distance, but she told me how I was always really special to her sister. She also told me she WAS interested in me that day in her room so many years before, but that she got really shy. And was disappointed I gave up and left. We had great sex too, but not like it was with Heather. With Heather it was some cosmic crazy soul sex, something I\u2019ve never experienced before or since. It wasn\u2019t GREAT sex per say, as neither of us knew how to HAVE great sex yet. But it was on some crazy level I can\u2019t explain. Yes, I loved that girl. Still do. But not in a normal way. It was \u201cjust sex\u201d, totally physical. Yet it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the sex. The sex was just an excuse to connect. The only way we knew how. What we did wasn\u2019t sex. It was something else. I can\u2019t explain it. It was sharing something, something I haven\u2019t been able to share since. Something I can\u2019t describe or put into words in any meaningful way. Whatever it was, Kent could feel it, and he hated me for it. We didn\u2019t work as a couple, Heather and I, and that likely is my life\u2019s greatest regret. I wanted to have something with her, but she couldn\u2019t commit to me. Or anyone really, except Kent in the end. I heard their relationship was always volatile and rocky. Her sister told me they were not good together, but stayed together anyway. I don\u2019t regret not being with her, as that was her choice. And I always respected her choices, even if I didn\u2019t like it. And even if it hurt sometimes. But she was never \u201cmine\u201d, we just traveled together for awhile. I had several serious girlfriends before her, and many after. I\u2019m not good looking or rich or even charming. But I\u2019ve always had more luck than was my fair share with the ladies (at least when I was young). Don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve had others that \u201cgot away\u201d, often due to my own mistakes. And I have serious regrets making those mistakes and letting them \u201cget away\u201d. But with Heather, I didn\u2019t let her \u201cget away\u201d. She was never mine to begin with. But she\u2019ll always be the \u201cone\u201d who got away, regardless. The one who never was mine to lose, and I regret that terribly. I know that\u2019s weird. Her body and soul she gave me freely. But her, her I could never \u201chave\u201d. I know that makes no sense, but it is what it is. I could have all of her, but not her commitment. Only for moments could I have her. But those were everything. I think about her all the time, still to this day. This spanned several years, off and on. From when I was 16 to maybe 19 or 20. But after the first few years we never allowed ourselves to be alone together again. But we did hang out from time to time. If she showed up at my door this moment, I\u2019d invite her in and I think I know what we\u2019d end up doing before the door really closed. I think that\u2019s why we stopped allowing ourselves to be alone together. We had no control when we were in the same room. None. Some things are beyond reason, some forces are stronger than anything that can be explained. We couldn\u2019t be together, but we couldn\u2019t be apart if we were close to each other. I still feel her pull\u2026.. over 3 decades and who knows how many miles\u2026 I still feel her out there\u2026 drawing me to her\u2026. I don\u2019t know that I miss her really, not the right word\u2026 I miss what we were when we were alone together\u2026 I miss those moments in time that are gone forever. Update: So after 30 years, and after I wrote this, I found someone whom I feel the same about as I did above. Strangely I reconnected with her just 3 weeks after writing this. Funny how that works. I really never thought it would happen. I didn't think it COULD! But here I am. With someone I can lose myself in like I did all that many years ago. And it's even better, more real and deep. I'm older now and I know myself better. It's something I never thought possible. Really what I describe above pails in comparison. But it seems in my life I can never love someone without it being complicated. Sigh\u2026 but if this doesn't work out, I'll have a new story about the one who got away. And it'll take me 40 years to talk about it if she does. Our first \u201cdate\" was a weekend long camping trip. We do things our own way! Wish me luck! This is the one for me!! I hope I'm the one for her! ",
