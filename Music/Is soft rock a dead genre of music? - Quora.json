            "answer_text": "I dont think any genre dies completely we had a bit of a soft rock revival in the Uk in the 00s for example. The biggest of those bands were The Feeling but there were others that dabbled in the sound as well like Scissor Sisters and Noah & The Whale. Here is some Feeling for you but anything of their debut \u201912 Steps From Home' will be up your street.   As for current artists again dabbling in Soft Rock ,I would check out Thundercat who has recently worked with Kenny Loggins and Michael Macdonald ",
