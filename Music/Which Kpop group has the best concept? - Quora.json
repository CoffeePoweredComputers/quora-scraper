            "answer_text": "as biased as it is: NCT have one of the best concepts. It\u2019s unique, it\u2019s new, it\u2019s interesting. Although rather complicated, once you understand it, nct can be a really fun group to stan/listen to. They\u2019re divided into 3 sub-units: NCT 127, NCT DREAM and WAYV. This way, it\u2019s hard to miss a member or not know about them since they have all been promoted under a unit. I like to consider NCT U a way in which members can unite and promote songs despite not being in their designated sub-unit. For example: Taeyong and Ten have promoted \u2018Baby don\u2019t stop\u2019 as NCT U since they\u2019re both in different sub-units. Another example of this is \u2018Yestoday\u2019 (Taeyong, Mark, Doyoung and Lucas) and \u2018Timeless\u2019 (Taeil, Doyoung and Jaehyun. Even though they\u2019re all in NCT 127, it is promoted as NCT U since not all 127 members participate in this). I feel like NCT is a really good group in terms of interacting with fans too. They\u2019re constantly putting out content (Pretty much every day) on a variety of different platforms (vlive, twitter, youtube, Instagram). So if you like watching idols do things for their fans, I\u2019d recommend NCT. ATEEZ have a pretty interesting concept going on. \u2018Hala Hala\u2019 and \u2018Say my Name\u2019 have the same dark, mysterious edge to them. While \u2018Pirate King\u2019 and \u2018Treasure\u2019 bring a more bright and paradise-like vibe to them. These concepts are all, while maintaining their distinct sound of electric kind of beats. Also, the members, (although I don\u2019t know much about them), seem like a funny and friendly bunch. ",

Just think of the storyline they\u2019ve had ever since and how they\u2019re making their ARMYs crazy on how to come up with good theories and you\u2019ll see and would probably agree with me. Their concepts are bomb and there are lots you could learn from it. (Watch out for the upcoming SMERALDO Books from BU!) aaand stream DNA! Hehehe ",
