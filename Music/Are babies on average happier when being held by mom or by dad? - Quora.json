Some babies do get very attached to mom and only want mom. Others couldn\u2019t care less who holds them. I have had both \u2014our firstborn was very happy with her daddy holding her on his shoulder and walking. Our second wanted nothing to do with ANYONE except mom until he could walk and found out that following daddy outside was more interesting than being inside with mom. Third was also a mama\u2019s boy until he could walk at 8 months and then preferred not to be held by anyone unless he was hungry, then I was allowed to hold him to nurse. He was extremely shy and wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone else unless he got to know the person for a bit. The last kids were just happy to be with the family and didn\u2019t care who held them!! ",

            "answer_text": "Babies are generally most happy when being held and spoken to by a calm and caring person. When they are a newborn, they are most familiar with the sound of their mother\u2019s voice and her smell. Of course it helps that she is a ready source of warm milk if she is breast feeding. That does not mean that a fathers touch is not needed and enjoyed by the baby. Feeling secure, hearing a calm and reassuring voice and receiving a warm bottle of milk while you drift off to sleep, can be equally rewarding to an infant. Babies are very receptive to tense and uncertain care givers. As long as the babies basic needs for human contact, clean diapers, food and security, are met, there is no reason that either parent can necessarily outdo the other. Consistency is important. ",

They are accustomed to how she moves, breathes and her heartbeat. They have heard everything she said since they could while she carried them. If mom breastfeeds babies can smell breast milk a few feet away! But I\u2019m referring to little babies. Once they become aware and social and daddy\u2019s engaged too, babies tend to switch \u201cfavorites\u201d and they will go back and forth between mom and dad. ",

If one is uneasy and nervous while holding a baby, then that baby is going to pick up on that. By the same token, if you enjoy holding them and playing with them, they will most certainly pick up on that. This matters not if it is mum or dad. They love to be held by those who love to hold them. ",
