I think it would be presumptuous for me or anybody else to be speaking for someone like Paul for how can we be so sure about how he feels? That's highly personal.  So here's Paul McCartney talking about John Lennon: \u201cThere was this period of John which is all pre-Beatles, pre-huge fame, pre-drugs - and it was another John completely - that was always there, right until the end. \u201cHe got sweeter, too, once he settled in New York. Once he was reunited with Yoko, and they had Sean, and he became this sweet personality again, and then he was more comfortable with himself. \u201cBut the acerbic is the one we know and love, you know, because he was clever with it, so it was very attractive. \u201cBut for me, I have more than a slight affection for the John that I knew then, when we were first writing songs, when we would try and do things the old songwriters had done. \u201cI slightly regret the way John's image had formed, and because he died so tragically it has become set in concrete. \u201cThe acerbic side was there but it was only a part of him. He was also such a sweet, lovely man - a really sweet guy.\u201d (The Independent, November 2012) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure Paul feels\u2026 Nostalgic for their early days as best friends. Over the years his feelings towards his early years with John have become golden in his mind (see the song Early Days). Frustrated over being forever compared to John. This goes back to the very beginning, and Paul will always be seen as slightly cheesy without John there to rein in his \u201cgranny music\u201d (as John would say). Saddened that his friend hasn\u2019t been there over the years. (see the song Here Today). Respectful of his friend\u2019s incredible talents and legacy. Paul\u2019s true feelings may not come out often in interviews, but Paul is fully aware that his best work was during his time with John. They were powerfully influential on each other. This could have been listed as \u201cbitter\u201d years ago. Regretful that they didn\u2019t fully mend their relationship before John died. They had spent time together in 1976, but never would see each other again after Paul\u2019s last few visits to John at the Dakota. And there were things left unsaid. Overall, it\u2019s complicated. These men changed the world, and their legacies will always be tied together. They\u2019re like brothers, where love and hate are very closely intertwined. ",
