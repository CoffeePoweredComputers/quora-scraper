            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak for Selena Gomez, as I\u2019ve never worked with her, but Britney can actually sing. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s Aretha Franklin but to say she can hardly sing is just false. I first heard Britney singing Whitney Houston\u2019s \u2018I Have Nothing\u2019 on a demo she did when she was 11. She was belting out high notes with feeling and control. I worked with her in the studio many times and she was quite a capable singer. I can understand if a pop singing isn\u2019t your thing but she has good pitch, phrasing, and overall musicality. Again, she\u2019s not the most amazing singer I\u2019ve heard, but she can certainly hold a tune and deliver a performance. If she was a contestant on American Idol you\u2019d be saying, wow, now that girl has a chance to win the whole thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe they can hold a tune and have an overall mass appeal. Also, pop music genre is not about singing. You think Ella Fitzgerald can sing Toxic the way Britney Spears does? Maybe she could, but Britney certainly can because that\u2019s where she shines. She is an amazing performer with an eye for eccentric fashion and a body built for dance, albeit all in 00s and late 90s. As for Selena Gomez, her talent is questionable for sure but millenials can relate to her because she is a part of their childhood (Wizards of Waverly Place). It is like asking why people don\u2019t have kale smoothies at McDonald\u2019s instead of Coke. They are healthier and don\u2019t contain insane amounts of sugar. Because people like it, it is a simple drink and sometimes that\u2019s all what people need. It doesn\u2019t mean a kale smoothie is not getting its due. ",
