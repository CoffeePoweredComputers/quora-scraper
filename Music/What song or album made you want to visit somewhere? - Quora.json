            "answer_text": "Thanks Alan. I thought of a lot of places mentioned in songs. Pink Floyd made Jupiter and Titan sound pretty cool in \u201cAstronomy Domine\u201d, although I\u2019d probably be better off taking their advice and going to \u201cSan Tropez.\u201d It\u2019s just that I feel like I\u2019ve already been there after hearing the song.   The dark side of the moon I\u2019m ruling out. Donovan made me yearn (*really Dave?) for an impossible destination. (unless it\u2019s just a place in the mind) I\u2019d better bring my fins. (flippers)  The Climax Blues Band weren\u2019t very convincing when they sang about this place. \u201cNogales\u201d I do love this song though, I\u2019d just like to keep my money and shoes.  Eric Burdon And The Animals made the case for this place. \u201cMonterey\u201d I\u2019ve been there, several times. The Aquarium there is a must visit, you really **otter see it.  Monterey Bay Aquarium Verified 47,546 subscribers 318 videos Located at the ocean's edge, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is your window to marine life -- for dive masters and non-swimmers alike ...  I wonder if Eric\u2019s been there? Besides music I\u2019m really keen on baseball, I\u2019ll bet dollars to donuts you never heard this song. \u201cDodger Stadium\u201d by Maury Wills, Willie Davis, and Stubby Kaye. Boy, that takes me back, sigh.  Yes, I have this album, you gotta listen to that song I\u2019m telling you. You\u2019ll have a new favorite. Unless you\u2019re a giants fan, ugh! So many great places, I\u2019m barely scratching the surface. Another trip to outer space courtesy of Tones On Tail \u201cTwist\u201d Where did those seagulls come from? Space Seagulls? I thought Daniel was singing about the planet where the alphabet starts with Z?  Space, France, Mexico, California, and back to Space. It is a hard decision. How about Hawaii? I wanna go here, to \u201cPipeline\u201d! We\u2019re going with The Ventures instead of The Chantays because this video is why I wanna go there.  I can\u2019t breath in space anyway. *yes, really. I\u2019m allowed some yearning. ** Pun intended ",

            "answer_text": "every concert recording and release made me want to get to Red Rocks. Growing up in AZ as a very serious rock fan\u2026 Red Rocks was on the bucket list. All I knew was tucked in the mountains somewhere called \u2018Morrison, CO\u2019. When I moved here, I learned it\u2019s just a Denver suburb. Even better, when there are not concerts, its a public park. People go there every day to exercise. Even better, since it is a public park\u2026 you can bring a guitar and play on stage. yes, I have played Red Rocks! btw, it is everything you have heard and dreamed and more. You really must come for a show. Wifey and I make it to at least 1 show a year. This year has been 3 already, and 1 more coming up in Sept (Beck!) it is in the foothills of the Rockies. Being where it is, it is VERY steep. As a result, when you are there\u2026 you are looking down at the band. Over the band and the stage is all of Denver laid out in the distance. Lemme see if I can find a pic that conveys this.   ",
