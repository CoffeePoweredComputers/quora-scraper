            "answer_text": "One of my favorite artists that would fit in this category is Barrington Levy. He started out in the 80s but I feel he has reinvented the way dancehall and rap have come together.   Although I think he is primarily classified as dancehall, a lot of his songs have a very heavy r&b influence with some deep bass tones. Give him a try on Spotify - I think you'll enjoy him! ",
