            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t buy that there are \u201cbest\u201d chord progressions, but some are enduring. Take this one: I V vi iii IV I IV V In C: C G Am Em F C F G Bass line: C G A E F E F G This is the familiar Pachelbel Canon (transpose up 1 step), also \u201c\"Jolly Old St Nicholas \u201c and \u201c\"Let It Be Me.\u201d Another: C Am F G The familiar foundation of \u201c\"Heart and Soul.\u201d Called \u201c50\u2019s chords\u201d, \u201c\"Ice Cream Chords\u201d or \u201c\"Doo Whop Chords.\u201d About a million songs use it. Note: Pachelbel Canon is one of the most abused titles in the music catalogue. It has been variously listed as \u201cPachelbel by Canon,\u201d \u201cPackel Bell Canon,\u201d and \u201cTaco Bell Canon,\u201d plus many more. Note 2: Bass players take heart. The bass line IS the canon. The rest is improvisation. It\u2019s still interesting after 400 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Boston, kool name btw, so many great progressions, including the time honored I VI IV V that accounted for so many songs over the decades. But, i will limit to a favorite turn around progression, that just tickles me! In key of C lets say: Cmaj7, Dm7, G13 G7#11 resolve back to Cmaj7. Sounds more difficult that it is Boston. Another dandy: Cmaj7, Em7, D#m7, Dm7, Am7 then use same last three chords above, G13 then G7#11 Cmaj7. ( can also do the progression minus the Am7, try both). Just so pleasing and melodic to my ear at least. Keep asking, tons more ideas out there, music is boundless! If of any help, let me know via upvote. Sinply indicates if folks find my input of value ",
