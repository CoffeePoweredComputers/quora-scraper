            "answer_text": "Most established wedding photographers will travel to destinations worldwide. The trick is to locate a couple of photographers whose style is a fit for you and your fianc\u00e9. Then make sure they are within your budget. A few of the wedding photographer listings (Wedding Wire, The Knot, WPJA) will show if they travel a photographer travels for destination weddings. Most photographers will charge their normal rate and add in the estimate travel costs. Those travel costs include airfare, rental car, lodging and per diem to cover meals and expenses (parking, baggage fees, etc.). I offer my couples the opportunity to use their credit card and/or mileage points to book the hotel and airfare which saves them a good chunk of money. Ensure that you ask all the pertinent questions so you know the photographer is not only a good fit stylistically, but also personality wise. The photographer will be with you and your family and friends for a long time on your wedding day. And in most destination weddings, they\u2019re also there the day before and the day after for the rehearsal coverage and possibly day-after wedding portraits. So make sure they fit well with the dynamics of everyone. Also be sure to convey why you picked this particular destination and what your expectations are. Good luck with the planning and have an awesome wedding day and an even better marriage. ",

            "answer_text": "1) I would ask something different, What are you looking for when hiring a PRO? It is obvious that the subjective perception of WHO will be the BEST photographer for you radically changes. I\u2019m a wedding photographer since six years and what I noticed in the last few years is that many of my new and old collegues make outstanding photos with a super nice quality - that usually it is thanks to the newest cameras- and for a client it is hard to distinguish from a newbie weekend-photographer and a professional one. Photos can be amazing but if you do not create a positive feeling between you and the photographer , believe me, the outcome will be a disaster. 2) MARKETERS VS PHOTOGRAPHERS. Marketing is very very important and useful but it doesn\u2019t mean for me that if you are not in the list of the 20 best Photographers in the world you do a bad work. Most of the names you mention are good photogrpahers for the International Photography associations -Money $ - but maybe not for you. 3) My deep suggestion it is to choose the photographer make you feel comfortable. Do not look about statistic and worldwide scores. Most of the times are done for marketing. Follow your vision and your heart. ",
