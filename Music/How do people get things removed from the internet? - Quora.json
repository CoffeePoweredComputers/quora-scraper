            "answer_text": "One assumes that you have attempted and failed to persuade the website owner (or \u201cwebmaster\u201d) of the offending site to remove the material you are objecting to. The only option you have beyond this is to contact the service provider who hosts the website from which you want content removed. If you can provide a good enough reason to override the rights of the website owner then in most cases the offending material will be removed or the website suspended by having its DNS temporarily revoked until the website owner complies. A threat of legal action that is likely to succeed will usually concentrate the mind of the service provider. However, if the website is hosted outside territories where the normal laws of defamation and libel or possession and distribution of indecent material apply, then you can apply to the NIC in an attempt to get the IP address of the server revoked or blocked via DNS. If you have a problem with a social media site there is usually a means by which you can lodge a complaint. It may take some time to get the offending material removed but if you have a reasonable case then there is a good chance of success. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously you can remove things from your own Facebook or other social media account. You can also remove things from your own webservers. Once it's gone you can wait for Google to notice, or you can submit a request to remove search results immediately. The webserver has to be up and accessible - if you take it offline, Google assumes that\u2019s a temporary problem. You can sometimes get things removed by asking the site owner - a picture from a school website for instance. Then again they can request removal from search engines, or just wait one spidering cycle (used to be 6 weeks). In some cases it may be near-impossible, unless you can hire lawyers to send copyright violation notices. Some sites like YouTube have a mechanism to expedite that. ",
