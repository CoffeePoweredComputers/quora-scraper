            "answer_text": "Liking atonality is like liking coffee. When you\u2019re a kid you don\u2019t like it, but you might try some coffee ice cream and think it\u2019s an interesting flavor. Then you\u2019re drinking cafe au laits, then you\u2019re craving black coffee. The equivalent of coffee flavor in my metaphor is excessive modulation and uncertainty in music. The early atonal music of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg is late-Romanticism\u2019s obsession with chromaticism and modulation taken to its logical extreme. If you already like Wagner\u2019s Prelude from Tristan und Isolde, then you\u2019re ready to try Schoenberg. If you go straight from Mozart, it\u2019s just gonna sound like a mess. The music I\u2019m talking about here isn\u2019t the same as serial music - Schoenberg invented the serial method later, and I\u2019m pretty sure that serial music or twelve-tone music is what you describe as being \u201cjustified with a concept or mathematical reasons\u201d. My impression of serial music so far is that the serial method on its own does nothing to make a piece sound unified and not sound like random notes. To write a good serial piece, the composer really needs to put their own effort in. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll approach this from the side of metal. I enjoy atonality because it can express a whole \u201cnew range\u201d of emotions and soundscapes. It can add a surprising element, or express darker themes much more clearly and emphatically than tonality and harmonies. This could be likened to why someone would enjoy horror movies (specifically psychological horror) - the thrill of the unknown and horrifying. While it might be justified with a concept, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. A lot of tonal music is also built around concepts. Just listen to any normal metal song that tries to evoke negative emotions like fear, rage, and so on, then listen to this, arguably the pioneering album of atonal metal:  You will hear the difference.
