            "answer_text": "Country music legend George Jones sang the song \u201cHe Stopped Loving Her Today\u201d on his 1980 album I Am What I Am. It was written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman and was the first hit for Jones in a decade at that time. It is about a friend who never stopped loving a woman, kept her letters, picture with him hoping she\u2019d come back but she never does, and the day he dies is when he finally stops loving her although she returns for his funeral. It\u2019s a beautifully sad sung song that sticks with you always. Jones didn\u2019t like the song, took long over a year to finish recording it, said it was too sad and depressing and no one would ever play it. He was obviously wrong, later stated it brought his career back and he credited the song in a positive manner thereafter. ",

            "answer_text": "George Jones. He was a real talent as well as real drinker. His career had been heading downhill before \u201cHe Stopped Loving Her Today\u201d came to his rescue. It gave him a chance to record more songs that got radio play, but again, his drinking did him in. In fact , he was hammered when he recorded what many consider today, to be the best country record of all time. He hated the song when he was asked to record it. He was so plastered when he recorded it, that, in the last part of the song where he is talking, the engineer had to take parts and put them together. He did the talking part many times, but he couldn\u2019t get through it without slurring his words. Great song, great singer and a sad real life man. ",
