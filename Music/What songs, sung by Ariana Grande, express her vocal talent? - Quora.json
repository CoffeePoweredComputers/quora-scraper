            "answer_text": "  Ariana is fucking amazing. She is a credit to this cruel world. To come back to Manchester after the terrorist attack. To raise money for those who were injured. To visit those who were injured in hospital. To pay for the funerals for those who sadly passed. She gladly deserves to be crowned \u2018Honorary Citizen of Manchester.\u2019 You only have to Google \u2018One Love Manchester\u2019 to see for yourself. One Love Manchester will be known as the BEST and worlds most ICONIC moments in music history. Not only for music, but for the world. #NOFEAR.  But since you asked for songs here\u2019s a few; Dangerous WomanThinkin\u2019 Bout YouSomewhere Over The RainbowOne Last TimePersonally I will be getting the symbol tattooed along with the bumble bee that she got tattooed herself for those who tragically lose their lives in her presence.  She is only human. She may be famous. She may have an outstanding voice. But she is only human. She didn\u2019t have to come back to Manchester at all. She didn\u2019t have to release the first press conference saying she wanted to pay for the funerals of those who had died. She could\u2019ve taken time off, cancelled the rest of her world tour and recover herself, mentally and emotionally. She is only human. But no. She continued her tour for her fans. She paid for the funerals. She came back to Manchester. She raised money for those injured. She has unreal amounts of courage, strength and vocal cords. She is only human. This was one of a fair few moments to be proud to be born in the U.K.   ",
