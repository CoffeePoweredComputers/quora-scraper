            "answer_text": "This might be a late reply as of November 2018, but Fl Studio Mobile 3 is an incredible app that sells for a fraction of the desktop daddy. Of course it\u2019s nowhere near as powerful as the full version. But the new interface and suite of features make it a great tool for when you want to get away from your PC or MAC and find some inspiration at the beach, up a mountain or in the cafe. Laptops are great, but mobile is super lightweight and what better way to knock out some ideas. And the strength of Fl Studio Mobile is that you can create the core of your song and then bring it into your full desktop version for refining and finalizing. Fl Studio is a work of art and very cpu efficient even on lower spec PC\u2019s or Macs.But buy the producer edition $199 or signature bundle $299 and use the mobile version on your iPad or Tablet. Yes you can use it on smartphones but the interface is micro and you need more space.As a Reaper DAW user, i see Fl Studio + mobile as a great tool unlike any other - awesome piano roll etc and tons of instruments & effects. Fl Studio Mobile 3 will whet your appetite for the full desktop version - that\u2019s a guarantee, and at ",

            "answer_text": "Huge! The amount of tools and instruments on the desktop version are HUGE and you can really fully produce a totally professional track from start to finish and tune the sound to exactly what you want. On the mobile version the amount of tools and instruments are very limited. You can make a pretty good sounding song but it will never be at a professional level. Also, the workflow is more difficult so a production may take a little longer due to the lack of precision because of that touch screen. ",
