            "answer_text": "The best site for your requirements, I would suggest, is Kompoz - Kompoz Music Collaboration When you join this site, you can join in collaborations started by others and start your own. I am a bass player and producer, so I post a backing track I have made and ask for other people's contributions, such as guitar, piano, lead vocal and so on; I also play bass parts for people who ask. You would post your lyrics as a text file and ask for someone to turn them into a top line of a song. Many songwriters struggle with lyrics, so this might be positive for you. You can also add lyrics to other people's songs. As with any site (such as Quora!) there is etiquette to be followed regarding submissions. Kompoz also covers many genres. ",

I know I\u2019d be interested in finding someone to write lyrics for my music, though I\u2019m not much of a singer either, so my expectation would be someone who could write and sing the melody, too. However, plenty of folks over there looking for just a lyricist, I\u2019m sure. ",
