            "answer_text": "That's a tough question because there's a lot of factors. I \u201cmake\u201d money off my music, as in I make more than I spend. It took a while, but I've finally started netting profit. That said, recorded music sales have gotten me only a little over $200 in 2 years. The money for me comes from gigs I play at local bars and coffee houses. I payed $400 for my personal amplifier, $700 for my guitar, somewhere over $500 for mics, cables, stands, a banner and business cards. After 2 years of regular (as in more than one a month) paid gigs, I have made that money back and more. That said, it doesn't pay all my bills, so I have a part time job and I'm still in school. Also, if I invested money in a real recording studio session, distribution of my music, physical merchandise, I'd have to sell A LOT to make profit. But that eventual profit would be closer to something I can live off - but to do that you have to be very persistent and very lucky. ",
