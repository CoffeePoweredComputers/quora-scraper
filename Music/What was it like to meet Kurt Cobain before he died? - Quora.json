            "answer_text": "I did briefly meet Kurt. Sorry for the long-winded story, but hey, I don\u2019t get to tell it often so here goes\u2026. Nirvana toured Australia only once, in 1992, headlining the first ever Big Day Out - Wikipedia. The night before the BDO in Sydney, they did a side show at the Phoenician Club (Friday 24th January, 1992). I had been in Auckland for work all week, and flew back in the afternoon. My wife (now ex-) and two of our friends picked me up from Kingsford-Smith and we went straight to the gig. I changed in the car on the way (no way I was going to attend a Nirvana gig in my work clobber). We arrived during the Meanies\u2019 set. Tumbleweed were on after them and played a reasonable set. Nirvana were late as I recall and played a good set, but it was only short, around an hour as I recall, and there were a couple of false starts. A couple of handy-cam videos have sprung up on you tube and they\u2019re not too bad. The person who shot them was sitting right next to us as it happens. I recall someone next to us with a cam, and when I saw the vids it was from the same area we were sitting, on the balcony at the back. Great view. Anyway, after the show we wandered back to the car. Parking around there was pretty bad so we had parked a couple of blocks behind the club. To get back to the car we walked down an alley at the side of the club, just the four of us, no-one else was walking that way. As we got to the back of the club, there they were - Dave, Krist and Kurt. Dave and Krist were standing up, but Kurt was sitting on the ground with his head in his hands. There was someone else there tending to him (no, not Courtney). Kurt was obviously sick (you can probably guess why) and was having a hard time by the look of it. Dave and Krist were happy to chat with us and we talked about the gig, and as it was the start of the tour, we chatted about where they were going next. We told them it was a great show, and they were grateful, even Kurt looked up and said thanks. One of our friends wanted an autograph, but we had nothing to write on (the girls didn\u2019t take their handbags into the club)\u2026 so I bolted back to the car and grabbed the first thing I found, my boarding pass from the afternoon flight from Auckland. I ran back, and the three of them signed it, yes, even Kurt. I shook hands with Dave and Krist, wished them a great tour, wished Kurt well, and he again said thanks. And we wandered off. So, TL;DR, Kurt was not feeling well but still had the grace to say thanks and sign an autograph. That makes him a pretty good bloke in my book. It\u2019s all a bit of a blur nowadays, being 25 years ago, but I do remember that they were just ordinary blokes, and were genuinely nice to us as we chatted. Looking back, they probably wanted us to GTF outta there, probably not wanting anyone to see Kurt like that. But still, they didn\u2019t tell us to piss off or anything, and meeting them capped off a good night. And I now get to say that I once met Kurt Cobain. Even if it was for only five minutes. \u2026and somewhere out there, one of my ex wife\u2019s nutbag friends has my boarding pass with Kurt\u2019s autograph. Bugger it. ",

            "answer_text": "The better question is when you met him. The bigger the band became the pre nevermind & post nevermind rocket ride. Buzz from The Melvins introduced us right before Bleach was made.  He was shy, yet confident. Quiet or making you laugh. His timing was impeccable.  He also was very tuned into the ATM Nirvana was for many people.   There was Kurt my friend. No mansions & yachts. Just like you and one of your friends. He didn't have superpowers. He was a dad, band mate , brother, son , husband and the biggest rock star in the world.  The biggest rock star in the world Kurt was a role he played. Everybody wanted something.   This was his way of dealing with all the press , record company, booking agent, radio and tv shows. He wanted to play music. That was his freedom. Success let him make the records he wanted.   So , if you were not an asshole, he was really cool. So, knowing him is one thing, meeting him at the store snd freaking out , maybe not. ",
