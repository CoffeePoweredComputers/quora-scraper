            "answer_text": "It can be argued. In reality it is too soon to know for sure, but what we do know is that we are talking about an artist who completely changed the direction of music in his genre, single handedly leading this genre of music to become the most popular in the world. Rap music, having so much under that umbrella of \u201crap\u201d whether it be with more use of singing or auto tune or with a pop feel, is without a doubt the number one genre in music today (7 out of 10 of the top ten songs in the USA currently are rap - 4 out of 10 for the world) and we are now in the era of streaming music everyone can have unlimited access to all music for free. So you\u2019d think the number one influencer of the biggest genre in music, during the biggest time of music listening in history, would mean that this person would be one of the most influential of all time. Drake, The Weeknd, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and so many others. All inspired heavy by Kanye West and his revolutionary styles of music. In the end we can\u2019t say for sure if Kanye is one of the most influential because just not enough time has passed. But, when you look at what he has done to completely change the direction of music for now and the future, he has a strong case. ",
