            "answer_text": "The piccolo is the most consistently used high pitch instrument. The highest note is written as C7 but sounds like C8 and is used frequently. The highest note on piano is also C8 but the highest notes are rarely used because they aren't that pretty. The highest note on flute is F7 and is, as far as I can tell, reserved for solo work. Ensemble work generally stops at C7 and is used frequently. Cody, playing the piccolo is even more earsplitting. Lol ",

            "answer_text": "The picollo is the highest pitched instrument. Some people think it\u2019s the flute, but it\u2019s actually the picollo. It\u2019s so high pitched and loud, that it can literally cut through an entire orchestra playing at the fort\u00edsimo dynamic level. A good example of this would be \u201cin the hall of the mountain king\u201d. Near the ending, once it gets really loud, you can hear this sound that is very distinct, that is the picollo. Hope this helped :) ",
