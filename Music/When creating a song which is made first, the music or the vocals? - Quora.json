            "answer_text": "This is dependent on the song. Essentially these days you have top line writers and you have track writers. The top line writer will probably be a vocalist with a good ear for melody and an ability to write good lyrics. They might have a little book of incomplete lyrics and song ideas they carry around with them. They might also have a dictaphone that they sing melody ideas into when they are driving, doing chores etc etc. A track writer will be more production oriented and might have a back catalogue of tracks in different genres he can whip out in a writing session. So a song could start with either. Sometimes, songs start with the title because it provides an overall theme and keeps the lyricist on track without splintering off down tangents. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, Achira, it depends on what a songwriter baseline is - and by that I mean, whether he/she is a lyricist (poet) or a musician. But most songwriters start with a hook or a melody, then fit lyrics to it, vice the other way around. Why? Because it is a more structured song that way. In other words, if I write a poem then want to fit music to it, I have to be musically prepared for different progressions or variations in the song because the syllable beat may not be exactly the same from line to line. But laying down a melody first allows the lyricist to hear the beats and create the words around it, usually a more structured song. ",
