            "answer_text": "I can relate to this question. I am guessing you mean that you can\u2019t sing so you won\u2019t be singing while playing. Not, you can\u2019t sing but are gonna sing anyways and need a song that will help cover that up. I can sing. I am not the best but I am not bad either. But I can not and will not sing in front of people. I have to many anxieties and it sucks. There is NO WAY you will get me to sing and the times I have, I am so anxious that I can\u2019t sing the way I want/should. So, that being said, I feel like I need to make up for that with my guitar playing. I can\u2019t rely on just learning simple chord strumming because I will be singing, I have to (or at least feel like I have to) play something on the guitar that would match the energy as if I was singing. Does that make sense? So I will learn songs that are more intricate and will keep the listeners attention better. A few songs I use are: Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton- This one is a tear jerker. I like to sing this song also but nobody but myself and MAYBE my girlfriend, if I am in the mood. But this is an impressive song to play if you take the time to learn it right and play it right. One Last Breath by Creed- This one is a good one to play with or without singing. Blackbird by The Beatles- This one is relatively easy to learn and is not a long one and is easily recognizable. Those are just a few songs that are lovely to play on guitar if the player isn\u2019t going to sing. -Drew ",
