BUT I had to answer this question. While there are NUMEROUS options I could choose from, I have to go with something that speaks to my inner demon (c\u2019mon now, we all have one). and that is Closer by Nine Inch Nails. I LOVE this song, it has all the right grab-you-by-the-guts moments. And it\u2019s a little naughty too ;) ",

If he disbelieves, then according to his/her own logic/reasoning, there can never be such a situation occurring. Thus the question is void. Its like asking what would you do if you were in a cartoppedfoldvint? If he is a believer in the existence of Hell, I doubt he could ask such a question. As default, this falls into disbelief. Conclusion? Void question. ",
