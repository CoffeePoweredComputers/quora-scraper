            "answer_text": "We have 2 paths to answer this question: 1) they don't have permission; and 2) they do. In the first case, obviously, they are acting illegally, and if discovered will get their vids deleted. In the second case, they get permission the same way anyone does: they ask, and almost certainly pay, the rights holders for permission. This may be as simple as contacting ASCAP or BMI and filling out a form (hint: I have never done this, so anyone who knows, please correct me!), or it could be a complicated process of discovery to find who owns the actual rights.
