            "answer_text": "This question can be worded so many different ways yet for me the answer will always be the same, John Lennon was a selfish and egotistical musician who hit it big with The Beatles and became an instant celebrity in a short space of time. Cynthia gave John her all, she put her future goals and plans aside so he could have the career and follow his dreams of making it to the toppermost of the poppermost. Cynthia fell pregnant when they were both young, she gave him the choice to go and he chose to stay. That was before he made it big. He fell in love with the idea of celebrity, and completely disregarded both her and their young son for the sex, drugs and music ideal with Yoko Ono. So many have given John a free pass because of his musical talents, yet they are completely blinded to the facts that as a human being he had no feelings for how he hurt his first wife and son and had no issue being verbally and physically abusive. While I have made my views obvious on this topic, I still see countless people saying leave John alone and blah blah blah. Clearly these people don\u2019t comprehend just how much impact that treatment scarred Cynthia and Julian. Easy to make comment from the outside looking in and taking cheap shots at Cynthia and Julian shows just how out of touch these people are. So many people are impacted by such attitudes every day and yet I bet most of these people would be taking a different view if the person in question was a John Doe nobody. Take your tinted coloured glasses off, being a celebrity doesn\u2019t entitle John to a free pass, for me, it is far from it. He should be held accountable for this reason. Being a celebrity he should have been held to a higher standard, not a double one. ",

            "answer_text": "He had a lot of demons and anger at that time. Also, he married a local girl, but then got so famous and wanted someone else. Yoko Ono pursued and wooed him. It should be hurt, and probably has. It was wrong how he treated Cynthia. Why do people deify celebrities, instead of accepting that they are people who can do right or wrong. One time in NYC, John Lennon was being drunk and rude towards a waitress. When he said \u201cDo You know who I am?\u201d, she put him in his place. John Lennon changed a lot for the last six years of his life. Much more mature and responsible. ",
