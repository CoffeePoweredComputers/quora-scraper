            "answer_text": "In my 30 years of hearing just about everything to come out of the Kpop industry, I\u2019m fully aware of a number of tracks exceeding 8 minutes. Among them, a few songs by the late \uc2e0\ud574\ucca0and his N.EX.T project comes to mind, and admittedly have to be considered mainstream Kpop, despite the experimental nature of the band/albums. They were certainly no Hongdae indie band. However, \uae40\ub3d9\ub960 is the king of long ballads, as both singer and composer. Which leads me to the following: I\u2019m pretty sure that \ucc9c\uc77c\ub3d9\uc548 (1995) sung by \uc774\uc2b9\ud658 is the longest Kpop song (5:52) that was (1) mainstream Kpop ,(2) wasn\u2019t a remake, and most importantly, (3) actually charted as the full-length LP version, something that radio show producers were not very fond of. However, by his 4th album he was already such a superstar, that this new ballad classic was certainly worth playing at its original length, especially because of the popularity of the song. Composed by \uae40\ub3d9\ub960.  When I toured in \uc774\uc2b9\ud658\u2019s band (2005\u20132007, 2011) he\u2019d have the interludes shortened by quite at bit, so the multiple final choruses would start sooner than on the album. However, with an extended instrumental to cloee the song, the total length would actually exceed 6 minutes, as did his show closer \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0ac\ub791\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\uc694. Note: the final track off of the same album exceeds 9 minutes, but it was hardly a radio-friendly song and quite unknown. . Other lengthy mainstream hits worth mentioning: \uae40\ub3d9\ub960 - \ub2f5\uc7a5  . Of course, probably the greatest and most structurally unorthodox ballad of 1994, also penned and sung by \uae40\ub3d9\ub960, \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uc2b5\uc791 by \uc804\ub78c\ud68c  . \uc57c\uc0dd\ud654 by \ubc4d\ud6a8\uc2e0  ",
