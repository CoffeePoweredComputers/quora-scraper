            "answer_text": "The first obvious answer is the Beatles. John Lennon and Paul McCartney shared songwriting and singing duties virtually equally. And lead guitarist George Harrison was a prolific songwriter and singer in his own right writing and singing lead on several Beatles songs including \u201cSomething,\u201d \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u201d \u201cTaxman,\u201d \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d \u201cI, Me, Mine,\u201d and \u201cWithin You Without You,\u201d just to name a few. Finally, Ringo Starr famously sang \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d along with \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d and \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends.\u201d Fleetwood Mac has had several lead singers beginning with Peter Green way back in the late 60\u2019s when they formed as a pop-blues band in London. Of course the popular Fleetwood Mac lineup of the 70s and 80s included Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, and Christine McVie on lead vocals on various tracks. A band that is certainly under-appreciated but has had a widespread influence on the Brit-pop scene is XTC. They began in the late 1970s as sort of a power pop outfit, but were definitely more New Wave than anything. They have spanned several decades, and their lead singers Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding also shared the song writing. I put them higher up in this list simply because they have been a favorite of mine for years, and absolutely deserve a wider audience. And then there\u2019s Pink Floyd. Original lead singer Syd Barrett fronted the group from 1965 until 1969 when he left the band due to mental health issues. But even during that time, founding members Roger Waters and Richard Wright also sang. Then David Gilmour jointed in 1967, and was the main lead on most albums. But of course Waters led on many tracks as well. We also can't forget the Eagles. Glenn Frey and Don Henley are widely considered to be the main lead singers, but let\u2019s not forget that Joe Walsh also sang and went on to have a successful solo career, as did Frey and Henley. Randy Meisner, Don Felder, Bernie Leadon, and Timothy B. Schmit all deserve a mention, though they would hardly be considered frontmen when it came to the Eagles. The Beach Boys had creative genius Brian Wilson as their defacto leader. But lead singing duties were generally given to Mike Love. Wilson sang lead on many of the ballads along with his brother Carl. Al Jardine and Dennis Wilson sang lead on many of the bands more upbeat tunes. I was surprised to learn long ago that The Cars actually featured two lead singers. I had assumed Ric Okasec sing lead on all of The Cars songs for years. In fact, bassist Benjamin Orr sang lead on some of their most famous tracks, including \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cDrive,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s All I Can Do,\u201d \u201cBye Bye Love,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Go,\u201d and one of my favorites, \u201cMoving In Stereo.\u201d I could probably go on and on with this list to include bands like: The Grateful Dead (Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir), The Band (Levon Helm, Richard Manuel, & Rick Danko) ZZ Top (Dusty Hill & Billy Gibbons)The Clash (Joe Strummer & Mick Jones)The Monkees (Davey Jones, Mickey Dolenz, & Mike Nesmith)KISS (Paul Stanley & Gene Simmons)Styx (Dennis DeYoung & Tommy Shaw)H\u00fcsker D\u00fc (Bob Mould & Grant Hart)Sonic Youth (Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon, & Lee Ranaldo)Fugazi (Ian MacKaye & Guy Picciotto)The B-52\u2019s (Fred Schneider, Cindy Wilson, & Kate Pierson)Alice In Chains (Layne Staley & Jerry Cantrell)Alkaline Trio (Matt Skiba & Dan Andriano)Linkin Park (Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda)Good Charlotte (Joel & Benji Madden)Mastodon (Brann Dailor, Brent Hinds, & Troy Sanders) Finally, it could be argued that Oasis had two lead singers in brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher. Liam was certainly considered the lead singer, but on more than one occasion when the mood struck him, Liam would decide not to perform and Noel would step in flawlessly. After breaking up, both bothers went on to form new bands independent of one another. Liam fronted Beady Eye before going solo, and Noel formed Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds, who are still active. ",

Ringo was good too but John, Paul and George had remarkable vocal skills. Especially John and Paul. Another great band I could think of is Fleetwood Mac with having two prominent lovers and singers ;) I could also mention The Band, with having three great singers Levon, Manuel and Rick. Robbie also had great vocal skills. Queen on the other hand I have to mention. Even though they typically weren\u2019t lead vocals, but along with Freddie, Roger Taylor had tremendous vocal skills. Brian May too had good vocals. But have to admit that Roger had almost same skills as Freddie. Cream also had two lead singers - Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton. The Byrds also. Blink 182 also had great singers - Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppus. Deep Purple also with Mark III and IV had two singers - Glenn and Coverdale. That all I could think off. By the way, thanks for the a2a :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of great bands that feature two singers who work as a duo. They often sing close or tight harmony, like the Everly Brothers or the Bee Gees. The Beatles had two of the greatest rock singers of all time in the same band and they used their duo talents generously and brilliantly over the years. They were possibly the greatest rock harmony group. However, I have another favorite I want to mention. I always enjoyed the vocal approach of The Jefferson Airplane when Marty Balin and Grace Slick shared lead vocals. Their voices were distinct, and they didn\u2019t really harmonize as much as they interwove their vocals, alternating, singing over each other, and sharing the vocal space as equals. It created a great effect and was completely original. I thought it was great. YMMV. ",

The Los Angeles Punk band X should count - the twining, keening mix of Exene Cervenka and John Doe are almost constantly battling for the spotlight on songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Desperate\u201d and \u201cJohny Hit and Run Paulene\u201d. Various incarnations of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship and Starship usually had two singers in the front: Grace Slick and Paul Kantner, Grace and Marty Balin, Grace and Mickey Thomas. Three Dog Night had three through their greatest era, as did Fleetwood Mac. Weir and Garcia threw it back and forth a lot in the Grateful Dead. I don\u2019t know if there have been many in this century, though\u2026 ",

My first focus will be Doom/Gothic/Symphonic metal bands I enjoy to include:  Lacuna Coil  Epica  Draconian  Sirenia  and Battlelore (which is a hybrid of genres) Additionally you have Melodic Black Metal bands (sure you could argue they are not true to \u201ctwo vocalists\u201d but more or less backup but still I will add them) that have two vocalists depending on the songs.  Chthonic  Cradle of Filth  Siebenburgen  Also Sojourner who are pretty much folk black metal. Those are just a handful of examples in heavy metal\u2026additionally in the more \u201cGothic\u201d realm of things there are these groups:  Blutengel who play a dark synthpop style  Ashbury Heights  Suicidal Romance  In Strict Confidence (no the goat is not one of the singers LOL)  A true Goth rock band: AoL sometimes fused vocals although Voe was their main vocalist RIP  Mephisto Walz is another good Goth Rock example So yeah these are some of my personal favorites for two vocalists.

They played off each other very effectively, and we can even add a third singer in the form of Christine McVie in that particular band. Generally though it\u2019s not something one sees too much. Another example is The B52s, like a weird alternative version of Abba, the two girls dovetailed nicely although like Fleetwood Mac they had a third singer in the form of Fred Schneider. ",
