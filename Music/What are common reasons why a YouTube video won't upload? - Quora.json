            "answer_text": "If there is a particular error message you\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s best to check out the YouTube help centre or user forum for this topic. Often others are experiencing the same problem and post in there to get help. Some common reasons for why uploads might fail or take a very long time are: The state of the YouTube/Google backend, which can sometimes suffer from temporary hiccups depending on where you are in the world that cause your uploads to get slowed down or cancelled altogether.The quality of your town\u2019s, suburb\u2019s, street\u2019s, building\u2019s or apartment\u2019s internet infrastructure, which determines the available upload speed per connected household. (check out this video streaming quality meter provided by Google)The number of devices that share your household\u2019s internet connection. The more devices are connected while you\u2019re attempting your upload and depending on what they do on the web, they all take away a chunk of the overall available upload bandwidth, i.e. the lower your computer\u2019s share of it will be.The type of connection between your router and your computer \u2013 WiFi or LAN cable.The age of your equipment \u2013 e.g. your router (what WiFi standard is it using, how many antennas does it have to communicate with the devices that are connected to it and how many devices are connected to it?) your computer (what WiFi connection speed is it capable of? Does it have the latest firmware for the WiFi chip?), etc.A weak or dropping WiFi signal due to interference with other devices (e.g.your microwave oven)A slow internet connection due to various other possible reasons.If your video file is large, there is a higher risk that the upload (which takes longer the bigger your file is) might get affected by one or a number of the possible reasons listed above. One option to reduce the risk of a failing YouTube upload is to compress your video before you upload it. If you\u2019d like to try that option, some friends and I built Clipchamp, which can help with that. ",

            "answer_text": "Most common reasons why video stuck during upload:- File size and type - the type of file you're upload and size not just the length of the clip or may be it's bigger then given size Slow internet connection - check your internet connection. One of the main reason why upload take long time is because of your net connection is too slow Heavy upload traffic - you might be uploading during a busy day time. At some peak hours, your service provider registeres spikes of upload traffic and might take longer to upload your video Resolution - HD video can be streamed in low resolution to a wide variety of playback devices as soon as the upload is complete. The availablity of higher resolution version should be available soon as the upload complete. If you're experiencing these issues then let your video finish uploading to YouTube. YouTube will notify you when it's done if you email settings is enabled. Hope these will help you. ",
