            "answer_text": "Music and dance are related because music is what people dance to. Dancing without music is sometimes just moves. They can enhance each other if the dancer applies the right moves at the right time for the music. Music gives dancers energy and feelings inside or sometimes gives them a way out of people to express themselves. Jamout - making musicians' lives easier P.S. Get your free account at Jamout ",

            "answer_text": "Music activates the motion center in the brain, instantly. Without passing through reason. As soon you hear something, your instinct is to move. So, as long it\u2019s not a grizzly in a forest and you need to run, you\u2019ll dance. Try to observe yourself in a mall, where\u2019s allways music, you\u2019ll see that you naturally move on it. So music and dance are inherently related. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the connection is rhythm. A simple beat, such as a regular heartbeat, is the rhythm of life. Hear the sound of that beat and you instinctively, automatically start to tap your foot. Dance music in whatever form has a prominent rhythm, the number of beats (heartbeats?) in the bar, the tempo. Marching rhythm spaces the beats evenly, swing music, dance music, reggae and others place emphasis on certain beats within the bar but it is the regular pulse of the music that creates the compulsion to dance. The music itself - the melody - embellishes this feeling and brings purpose and meaning to what would otherwise become just a mechanical response. ",

In this century, technology (particularly music recording) has firmly separated the two. But in most other traditions they are necessary to each other. Great dancers embody music and great musicians are \u201cmoved\u201d to play. Separating the two traditions as we do in western universities has weakened both arts. ",
