            "answer_text": "How do we know what Shakespeare\u2019s plays were like, since movies weren\u2019t invented until 1892? Answer: we have Shakespeare\u2019s scripts. A script for a play doesn\u2019t give us an exact representation. We don\u2019t know if an actor picked up a prop at a particular time (unless there\u2019s a stage direction for that specific action). We don\u2019t know what his or her facial expression was. We don\u2019t know if the original production starred an actor with a lisp, or a limp, or a red goatee. But we know what the words were, and we know what order they were spoken in. We know that because the scripts survive. It\u2019s exactly the same thing with music. We don\u2019t know exactly what bowing the violin used in the first performance of Bach\u2019s partitas. We don\u2019t know the exact tempo for the first performance of Beethoven\u2019s fourth symphony, or whether the bassoon missed a note in the debut of one of Vivaldi\u2019s concertos. But we know exactly what notes they played, and in what order. Because the scores survive. So we can recreate what we think happened. Scores, like play scripts, are NOT performances. They are instructions for performances. Like any written instructions, they are representations that were clearly understood at the time\u2026 but over time, the meaning can become a little fuzzy. If I say \u201cmy father\u201d, you know what I mean, because you and I share the same language at the same moment in time. If I say \u201cmin faeder\u201d you probably wouldn\u2019t get the idea that I was talking about \u2018my father\u2019 - but if you rolled back the clock by 1000 years you\u2019d get it, because that\u2019s how it was written in middle English. In the context of a longer sentence or paragraph you might get the basic idea, but it\u2019s not the same as the original communication. Same thing with music. The basic ideas HAVE changed. We\u2019ve changed tunings - today we use equal temperament, Bach used well temperament, Godric of Finchale used mean temperament. The interpretation of notations have changed: grace notes today precede the main note, but in the 1700s they delayed the main note. Some musicologists work hard to try to recreate what, exactly, an original performance sounded like. Some ensembles use period instruments, which can be pretty different from their modern versions, to try to recreate sounds from the past. The farther back you go in time, the harder that is to do. But we do the best we can. And we work with what we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s entirely possible that Benjamin Franklin had a mole on the side of his nose, and he paid off the portrait artists to overlook it. We don\u2019t know for sure. It\u2019s entirely possible that our best recreations of a piece by Thomas Tallis is something he\u2019d shake his head at and say \u2018you just don\u2019t get it\u2019. We don\u2019t know for sure. But like a Shakespeare play, we can still enjoy it. If you listen to a Bach piece played by a modern orchestra, and listen to the same piece played by a \u2018historically informed performance\u2019 group like St. Martin of the Fields, you will hear differences (if your ears are good enough). But don\u2019t let that stand in the way of enjoying the beauty of the performance. ",

            "answer_text": "If no recordings happened before 1860, how did classical music save through the years? Before the invention of the phonograph people had devised a remarkable way to preserve their thoughts, ideas, and music. It was called pen and paper. Composers would use a pen to scribble the notes they wanted musicians to reproduce on special paper called \u201cscores\u201d which others could read. These \u201cscores\u201d could be taken to a print shop where they could be typeset and reproduced by the hundreds or thousands and then distributed so that musicians the world over could perform the works they had never before heard. Remarkable system that worked well for centuries. Even today musicians use these \u201cscores\u201d to reproduce music though most composers have now replace the pen and paper method with computer programs to transcribe their original works for distribution.
