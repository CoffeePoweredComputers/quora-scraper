            "answer_text": "From my experience as a fan and as I already passed the crazy life of a kpop group fan and now just someone who enjoy any good kpop songs, these are some reasons why kpop is so addicting: They don\u2019t just sing or dance or rap, they perform. that\u2019s how kpop groups are made, different talents from the members are put together to perform the perfect performance from singing, dancing, rapping even they have members that are good at playing music instruments, write a song, entertainer and looking good by just breathing. put them all together then you can get the perfect kpop group.Kpop group members are not just random people that got put to perform together. they were trained for years and by training means practicing every single day from singing to dancing to language. and when the company finally decide they were good enough, they will debut and release a song or album, and the practicing keep going as they have to come up with different choreography for each song.Explaining point 1, kpop groups members have their position. so if one person can not sing well, he/she will be put as a rapper or a dancer and vice versa. so as a group they don\u2019t have flaws.They use theme in their performance. If a group is promoting an album or a song, their entire performance is connected through a theme. from their outfits, their choreography, their music video and even their facial expression while singing making again, the perfect performance.Their song are catchy. that\u2019s why when you listen to kpop you can find one or two (or more) english words being repeated in the refrain part, so it will be easier and more unique for people to remember. (since korea don\u2019t really use english much and have a different pronunciation)They don\u2019t just perform. they do fan-service (interaction with their fans), they do entertainment shows, tv drama, movie, concerts, fan meeting, live streaming and many more, so fans of kpop are known to be loyal and super addictive to their idol and they never forget to say thank you to their fans everytime they achieve awards.They don\u2019t stick with one style. they usually do have their signature sounds or moves but their style often changes as they promote their new song. it can go from lively song to dark concept to sexy concept and even cute concept.They always look good. its either performing, going on tv shows or just going to airport. their fashion are always trendy and on point and of course they have their stylist anywhere they go. and they never forget to maintain their skin health by going to dermatologist and use skin care product on daily basis both for men and women.you don\u2019t have to understand a song to enjoy the music, listen to kpop and you\u2019ll see :) ",

            "answer_text": "Many people (including me) have fallen into what I like to call, the \u201cK-POP whole\u201d. *Let's start off with the basics; K-POP stands for Korean Pop. It's pretty self-explanatory. People that want to become K-POP idols will have to leave their family behind at a very young age, for at least 3 years, to join a company and train. These people are called trainees. Trainees have to work hard, learn how to dance, rap and sing. But sometimes, all this hard work doesn't pay off, and some trainees don't end up debuting. *When a K-POP group debuts, they are called rookies. Korean Award Shows give the award of Rookie of the Year every once in a while. When a company of a K-POP group decides to debut another group, the first group will be 'Sunbaenims'. Most K-POP groups have 4\u20138 members, but groups like NCT and Seventeen have 13 members. In K-POP, there are temporary groups. Temporary groups are groups that only last 1\u20132 years before they disband. And they were meant to disband pretty soon because the group signed a contract. Temporary groups are kind of like experiment groups. *The real question is; \u201cWhy do people love K-POP?\u201d Easy, people love K-POP because there are all types of concepts. Ex: Girl crush, savage, bad boy, bad girl, cute, Lolita, etc! Some of the most popular K-POP groups are; BTS, (Bangtan Sonyeondan- Bangtan Boys) Blackpink, BigBang, Momoland, MAMAMOO, SHINee, Stray Kids, Super Junior, Seventeen, NCT (and their sub units; NCT127, NCTDream, and there is a couple more), EXO, Red Velvet, TWICE, and Got7. K-POP gives you this kind of adrenaline. Many concerts are turned up, and the fanchats are as loud as you can imagine. BTS (my favorite group) has been the only K-POP group EVER to be on the Billboard Hot 10, has won a Billboard Award, has been nominated for the GRAMMYS, won a AMA, has 17 Daesangs (Korean Awards) and much more. *Overall, K-POP has a different sensation to American pop. K-POP has very catchy songs; Boom Boom (Momoland), Fake Love (BTS), Get Cool (Stray Kids), Tempo (EXO), Ddu Du Ddu Du (Blackpink), Bang Bang Bang (BigBang), Likey (TWICE), Gee (Girls Generation/SNSD), IDOL (BTS).
