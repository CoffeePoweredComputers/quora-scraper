            "answer_text": "Several answers exist to this question, but first, another question to the person posting: what will you be connecting your DVD player to? There are several USB versions to connect to your computer as well as stand-alone Blu-Ray DVD players to connect to a home surround system. Which do you seek? For everyone reading this, I highly recommend a high-quality Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC) to connect any of your devices through to your computer. One device on the market is the MIYO which is a palm-sized DAC that connects via USB to your computer and the sound is AMAZING! If the original posting already owns a home surround system, it would be good to know the manufacturer name and model # of the unit. For example, there are quite expensive high-end/high resolution DVD players on the market for the audiophile and you can get a good quality Sony or Toshiba Blu-Ray/DVD player for less than $100 if you have a mid-level home audio system. Sumeet\u2019s post demonstrates two solid, mid-level DVD players for the latter system. However, if you have an audiophile receiver you wish to run the DVD player through, then you\u2019ll want something more high-end like the Cambridge Audio CX-UHD. ",

            "answer_text": "Your main problem is that most DVD players do not include good quality audio DACs so you should probably plan to get a player to use as a transport device for the disc and a separate high quality DAC. You don\u2019t say if you want to play DVD audio discs, if you do you should make sure the player supports that format and you get at least a 24 bit 96KHz DAC. ",
