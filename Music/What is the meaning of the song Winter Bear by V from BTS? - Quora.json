            "answer_text": "\u201cWinter Bear\u201d starts off with BTS\u2019 V addressing a romantic interest. But as the track progresses, the lyrics become increasingly symbolic and thus more challenging to break.  As many of us know, bears hibernate in the winter. They sleep for an extended period of time. And in this song, V is also observing the addressee and comments that this individual, \u2018sleeps so happily\u2019, which reminds him of a \u201cwinter bear\u201d. And the way he uses this metaphor in the song\u2019s singular verse can also be interpreted as being directed towards a lover.  However, in the pre-chorus the song gets heavily-metaphorical. And the prevailing theory seems to be that the \u201cwinter bear\u201d is actually the taehyung's grandmother, with this song being intended to commemorate the third anniversary of her passing. FYI, V was actually raised by his paternal grandma, who expired on 4 September 2016. And fandom has more or less concluded that this track is dedicated to her. And the sentiment he is expressing is basically that he misses her and more specifically wishes that she rest in peace.

            "answer_text": "Some say that he wrote the song to honour his grandmother's death, which he was extremely affected by. If you see the lyrics, it will make more sense. That's why he sings \u201cSleep like a winter bear\", because he wants his grandmother to rest in peace, just like a bear hibernates peacefully in the winter. ",
