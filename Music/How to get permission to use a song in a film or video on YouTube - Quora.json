            "answer_text": "One of the most important things to know is that there are two rights to every song. There is the person who wrote the song (who holds the publisher rights) and the person who recorded it (who holds the \u201cmaster\u201d rights). To use the song you need permission from both entities. You may need to pay these people to use the music. If there is more than publisher you must get permission from all publishers. This is the extent you must go to if you are creating a professional movie. If you are just doing youtube a simple credit in the description should be enough. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a youtuber myself and I use copyrighted songs almost in all my videos and when I was new, I used to get copyright strikes but now when I am a YouTuber for more than 1 year. Now I don't know why but I think due to the new policy, my videos are not removed from youtube. But the only problem that you may face is that you may not be able to monetize your videos in most cases. ",
