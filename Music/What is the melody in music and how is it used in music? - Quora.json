            "answer_text": "Melody is a horizontal element in music. This means that a melody can be heard as a succession of related notes as opposed to harmony which can be heard instantly as simultaneously played notes. The succession of related notes means that the notes need to form a somewhat coherent musical line in order to be perceived as a melody. For example if every consecutive note was played by different instrument, or in extreme high and low pitches, people couldn\u2019t easily perceive those notes as a melody. In many genres of music, the whole pieces usually rely on melodies and they are what makes people remember and categorize the pieces. Songs in popular music tend to be based on a vocal melody, which is then reinforced with chordal and rhythmical accompaniment. This type of music is called homophonic because there\u2019s only one melody to follow. On the contrary, pieces in classical music are often polyphonic i.e. they contain many independent melodies. In fact, one can see that the rise of polyphonic music during the Middle Ages provided a kick-start to the music which evolved into classical music during the following centuries. Application of polyphonic (also called contrapuntal in Baroque [1600\u20131750] music and onward) composition methods were very advanced in the Baroque and J. S. Bach is considered one of the most skillful composers using these methods. He is particularly famous for his fugues, which are compositions filled with purely polyphonic melodies. The techniques of treating melodies in music are so various and they require so much different things to consider, that I can\u2019t provide a comprehensive guide in a single answer in Quora. However, I can recommend a book of composition methods in classical music: Harmony and Voice Leading by Edward Aldwell & Carl Schachter. For popular music there is Melody in Songwriting by Jack Perricone. I hope that someone with knowledge of Indian music would give an overview of melodies. Indian music is really interesting because the treatment of melodies is on a very different level in India than in the Western world. ",

            "answer_text": "Melody is the relationship of notes going from left to right. In Western Music there are 12 notes and 7 intervals. The intervals are what matters. They are (from consonant to dissonant): the octave or tonic - no resolution needed the perfect fifth - no resolution needed the perfect fourth - resolves to either the third or the fifth the major third - resolves to the root/octave or fifth the minor third - resolves to either the root/octave or fifth the major second or whole step - resolves to either the root or octave the minor second or half step - resolves to either the root or octave the tri-tone - can resolve to the root, third or fifth Since the scales are cyclical we can call the 6 a minor third (in a major scale) because it is the same distance from the octave as the minor third is from the root. That having been said. All of these intervals cover all 12 notes, All of these notes \u2018resolve\u2019 to the closest note in the chord which is based on the scale being used. In a major scale the chord would be a major chord consisting of the 1, 3 and 5. You can play any note you want so long as you stop on one of those notes. So if you write a song and there is a C major chord, the main notes in your melody would be C-E-G, those are your stopping points (the notes you hold on). You can use any other notes you want so long as they are \u2018passing tones\u2019. And if you stop on the 3 you should make your way to the 1 unless you\u2019re Jimi Hendrix or want to sound like him. When you move to the next chord everything changes to accommodate that chord and the scale it is based on. That is hardcore old school theory on writing melodies. ",
