            "answer_text": "That would be fraternization between officers in a chain-of-command relationship. This is prohibited for good reason. In other words, Kirk is Uhura\u2019s direct commanding officer. It\u2019s inappropriate in the armed services to allow relationships to occur in this situation, because it\u2019s too susceptible to abuse. A superior officer who has authority over the junior officer\u2019s duties and career could use their power to force the junior officer into a relationship unwillingly, or punish them if they break off the relationship. Fraternization is not tolerated in 20th century armed forces. I assume Star Fleet has similar regulations. If they wanted to have a relationship, they would have had to wait until they were assigned to different ships. Also because it was a TV show in the mid-1960\u2019s, during the peak of the Civil Rights movement. A relationship between a white man and a black woman is hardly remarkable today, but at the time, it was barely on the heels of a controversial legal case Loving vs. Virginia, which had to appeal to the US Supreme Court to strike down state laws criminalizing mixed-race marriage. This court decision was in June 1967. In November 1968, an episode of Star Trek showed a passionate kiss between Kirk and Uhura, but the scene showed the kiss as under duress. Aliens with telekinetic powers were forcing them to kiss, with the intent to humiliate them. The actual contact of the kiss was carefully blocked by Uhura\u2019s head. This was still as daring scene as the producers of prime-time TV in 1960\u2019s felt they could get away with. They feared a significant portion of the TV audience would still have been offended by the scene. Court rulings don\u2019t change people\u2019s feelings overnight.  'Star Trek's' interracial kiss 50 years ago boldly went where none had gone before Thankfully, the producers were wrong. The scene did not cause public outrage, in fact it resulted in the most fan mail for any single episode of Star Trek. That\u2019s a reassuring thought. Even if Star Trek depicted a future in which barriers of race were no longer an issue, it\u2019s still perfectly reasonable for Kirk and Uhura to have been troubled by being forced to kiss. They were coworkers, not lovers, and it was inappropriate for them to have a romantic relationship given their working relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, they did.  But even if he had a mind, Kirk is an officer and a gentleman. A clear protocol of a mixed-company crew, not only forbids officers from engaging in personal relationships with those under their command (as Janice Rand found out when she failed to get Kirk\u2019s notice); but it would also be unwise, since it could compromise the professional decor of the ship. As Kirk tells Marla McGivers in \u201cSpace Seed,\u201d the conduct of a single crew-member can compromise the entire ship (and the irony of this being a \u201cChekov\u2019s Gun\u201d is not lost here, since that was the only Chekov in the episode). However even aside from this, Kirk and Uhura had nothing more in common than serving on the same 5-year mission; however the bonds formed on that historic voyage outlasted it among the whole senior crew. As noted in \u201cThe Man Trap,\u201d Uhura had a preference for Swahili men; as she noted in \u201cThe Naked Time,\u201d she was neither fair nor a maiden. And of course, Kirk preferred blondes. ",
