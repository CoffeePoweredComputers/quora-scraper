            "answer_text": "I disagree wholly with the other answer. A 2nd generation i7 may have 2 more cores to work with, but with the newer i5, 5 generations worth of improvements have been baked in. You will have significant improvements across a number of metrics. Unless your applications are heavily multithreaded, you will likely get more day-to-day performance out of the newer i5 if the clock speeds of the two chips you\u2019re comparing are not wildly different.

            "answer_text": "7th Gen i5 is my pick. 1. Smaller die size makes for faster chip.2. i7 2nd gen along with first gen were notorious energy hogs. 3. Gen 7 has a noteable improvement in turbo technology makeing for better use of the technology in a single core.4. Gen 7 has a much better bus communication with Memory. 5. Gen 7 allows for QDR memory.6. Gen 7 has better graphics on chip performance.7. The newer cores support higher speed buses that allow for some of the insanely fast SSD transfers.I am sure there is more. ",
