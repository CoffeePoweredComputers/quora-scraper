            "answer_text": "If you do nothing else, take ballroom dance lessons. It will teach you how to listen to music in such a way that you have to feel the pulse of the music, even if the beat is not made explicit with a drum or an emphasized downbeat. Dance lessons will also help you feel the sway of the music, which is often even harder to find than the beat.  It is virtually impossible to dance if you cannot feel it. Once you learn to dance a little, you will know you are beginning to feel it. ",
