            "answer_text": "     Shakira Biography - Singer (1977\u2013) Born and raised in Barranquilla, Colombia, Shakira is a hugely popular Colombian pop singer who is known for the hits 'Whenever, Wherever' and 'Hips Don't Lie.' Who Is Shakira? Born in Colombia on February 2, 1977, hugely successfully Colombian pop singer and dancer Shakira has won multiple Grammy, Latin Grammy and American Music Awards. Known for hits like \"Whenever, Wherever\" and \"Hips Don't Lie,\" Shakira is the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, with estimates of more than 70 million albums sold worldwide. Additionally, she has served as a judge on the popular singing-competition show The Voice. International Stardom While hugely popular throughout much of the rest of the world, Shakira had not yet achieved a major record on the U.S. pop charts. In an attempt to increase her American fan base, in 1997, at the age of 20, the singer moved with her family to Miami, Florida, and taught herself to write songs in English. There, she enlisted Emilio Estefan, of Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine fame, to act as her manager and producer. In 2001, Shakira released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, which quickly brought her the success in the United States she had been waiting for. The album reached No. 3 on the charts, selling more than 200,000 copies in its first week of release. Laundry Service's big hits included \"Whenever, Wherever\" and \"Underneath Your Clothes.\" Shakira returned to the Top 10 of the albums chart twice in 2005. She released the Spanish-language Fijaci\u00f3n Oral, Vol. 1 in June of that year, followed by the English-language Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 in November. Fijaci\u00f3n Oral, Vol. 1 garnered Shakira her second Grammy, this time for best Latin rock/alternative album. Touring extensively, Shakira went on to release two concert albums: 2007's Live and 2008's Oral Fixation Tour. In July 2009, she put out a new single, \"She Wolf,\" from her studio album of the same name. The album hit No. 15 on the Billboard charts in 2009, and went platinum in 2010. Around the same time, her hit \"Waka Waka\" from 2010's Sale el Sol became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Shortly thereafter, the now-global superstar headed on tour to promote her album. By January 2016, the video for \"Waka Waka\" had been viewed more than a billion times. Attribution: Shakira ",
