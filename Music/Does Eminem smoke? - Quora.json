            "answer_text": "Eminem is a very reclusive guy so it would probably be hard to give you a factual answer, but as a huge fan I would guess no: he doesn\u2019t smoke cigarettes or weed. Yesterday (4/20/2018) is I believe the 10th anniversary of Em being completely sober following his overdose, and I\u2019ve read reports that ever since he got clean he doesn\u2019t drink or smoke anymore. I\u2019ve read & watched different interviews about his life during the height of his drug addiction (mid-2000s) and it sounds like back then he did just about anything he could do to get a buzz. ",
