            "answer_text": " Why is Justin Beiber given so much importance in this love triangle? Why is every question 'Who is good for Justin Beiber- Hailey or Selena?' Why isn't there a question like 'Does Justin deserve any of them?' or 'Is Justin good for Selena?'  Anyways,I think Selena really did 'dodge a bullet'. I think he was just using her. I mean all those on and off relationships?She and Justin had a relation from their childhood.They grew up together.She still loved him and he didn't anymore BUT he still used her when he was desperate and lonely and she went back to him. I really think she shouldnt have left the weeknd for beiber but now I am glad that this Justin chapter is  \u2018Closed and done.\u2019 I think she has become stronger and smarter now.She has prioritized her career more than she ever did.Her album Rare is straight up fabulous. Beiber never deserved Gomez. Only Baldwin can tolerate his immature and childish behaviour.I am not judging anyone's singing or profession.Neither am I disrespecting the fact that he was ill and everything. Apart from all of that if you watch his documentary Seasons,it shows how immature he is. I had no issues with Hailey but after seeing how hateful she is and seeing her Instagram story of 'I will kill you\u2019 JUST AFTER THE PREMIERE of lose you to love me ,the first song of selena's album Rare . honestly Baldwin and beiber are perfect for each other.  Selena doesn't deserve all that pain for a person as shitty as him. there are lot of other people who will see the unique her and not hurt her. I am sure there is someone who recognizes how rare she is.  She is a queen and there's no place for someone who is not a king. ",

The Beliebers die to know every detail of the private and sentimental life of their idol, especially what has to do with Selena Gomez and Hailey Baldwin.
