            "answer_text": "For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve been to four concerts this year, and in three of the four, a 12 string guitar was utilized. Granted, we\u2019re not talking about hugely popular acts, for the most part. In fact, most people likely haven\u2019t heard of 2 of the 3 acts I\u2019m about to mention, and the third hasn\u2019t had a hit in years. I saw \u201cThe Neal Morse Band\u201d in February, where Neal Morse played a double neck acoustic guitar in several of the songs, with one of the necks being a 12 string. In September, I saw Lenny Kravitz, who played a 12 string guitar for one of the numbers. And in October, I saw Dream Theater, in which John Petrucci played a 12 string guitar in two of the songs. Whatever the case, I think they\u2019re used less in popular music because it\u2019s just not the current style. And for the record, the fourth concert I saw this year was Weird Al. No 12 string, but an accordian! ",

            "answer_text": "12 string guitars seem to have disappeared. Was it because they were too difficult to play? 12-strings became popular back in the 60s and 70s (mainly 70s). They create a chorus-like effect with strings tuned (mostly) in octaves. You know what makes a better chorus effect today? A chorus pedal. Which is easier to play with, a 12-string or a chorus pedal? (You should have said \u201cchorus pedal\u201d.) Add a little bit of a flange effect to the chorus. Then add some delay. Then compress the hell out of all of it\u2026or don\u2019t. No pedals? Do it from the board. The possibilities now days go far beyond the scope of a 12-string. And are much easier to play. ",

Still, Guild continues to make a model of their highly respected 12 string acoustic so there must be some demand. I only ever knew one person who played one regularly. He originally did religious themed folk music but went on to do a one man Jethro Tull tribute act. ",
