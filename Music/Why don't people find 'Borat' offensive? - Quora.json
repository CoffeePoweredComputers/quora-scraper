            "answer_text": "Because not everyone is a Social Justice Warrior and can take a joke. Most mature normal people get the concept of offensive humor and find it funny. Unlike Black Lives Matter and Feminists, normal people enjoy making fun of identity politics and their country\u2019s stereotypes made fun of. I\u2019m Irish and I love it when people make alcoholic and potato jokes about my country. I know many Asians who make jokes about eating dogs. The same goes for religion and sexuality, most Jewish people love Mort from family guy. At the end of the day, offense is taken not given. ",
