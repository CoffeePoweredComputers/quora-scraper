            "answer_text": "It\u2019s because iTunes is very buggy software that just doesn\u2019t work reliably and Apple doesn\u2019t care enough to fix it, I\u2019ve experienced this off and on for several years and there\u2019s no help or solutions anywhere. The only option is to tediously add the artwork one album at a time. As near as I can ascertain, \u201cGet Album Artwork\u201d used to just look for the current album, but it was changed to go get artwork for all albums with missing artwork. If any of them throws an exception it fails silently and nothing happens. It used to tell you if the artwork was unavailable, but now when you click on \u201cGet Album Artwork\u201d nothing happens. This is just textbook piss-poor application design. But it\u2019s Apple, so not unsurprising. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually it\u2019s an issue with the album\u2019s meta-data that causes it to not match up exactly with how the album is listed in the iTunes Store. Misspelled words, punctuation - you name it. In some cases, it can just be that that exact album isn\u2019t available in the store, so there isn\u2019t anything to match. (This is a lot rarer now than it used to be, as the iTunes Store is fairly comprehensive for the last 20 years of music.) Clean up your id3 tags so that they match the album as it is listed in the store and you will have 100% success in my experience. If the album isn\u2019t in the store, you can manually add the artwork, which can usually be found with a quick google image search. ",
