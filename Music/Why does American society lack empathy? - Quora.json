            "answer_text": "Compared to whom? Russians perhaps? Germans? Syrians? Chinese? Empathy is not a national cultural trait and certainly not something that the lack of which would become a specific American trait. Right now, Trump and his administration are being raked over the coals for doing something that almost every Western country has done regularly with those they deem \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d That that uproar exists demonstrates that very many Americans have high levels of empathy. When there is an Ebola epidemic or a famine, one usually finds Americans risking their own lives and wealth to address that problem. While many Americans lack empathy \u2014 we just elected a President who has always had an empathy deficit \u2014 the conclusion that \u201cso many\u201d Americans lack it is not supported by the evidence.

            "answer_text": "Why does American society lack empathy? I see little evidence of that, either in statistics or in personal life. It seems for example is evidence that Americans give more to charity: The USA, New Zealand and Canada have the highest rate of charitable donations as a percentage gross domestic product (GDP), the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) found. The UK had the fourth highest rate of charitable donations in a study of 24 nations and topped all other EU countries that were looked at. CAF\u2019s report took data from countries accounting for around 75 per cent of global GDP and 53 per cent of the world population These are the world's most generous countries Perhaps you are thinking that Americans have a less generous welfare state than Western Europe, and that is true, but it is still very high, particularly when medical spending is taken into account:   That American social spending is lower than social spending in Western Europe is probably a consequence of the fact that the country is so diverse and that flaws in the American electoral and legislative system give conservatives political power out of proportion to their numbers.
