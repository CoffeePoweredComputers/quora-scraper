            "answer_text": "Got To Get You Into My Life was specifically written by Paul McCartney about his love for weed. \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life was one I wrote when I had first been introduced to pot. I'd been a rather straight working-class lad but when we started to get into pot it seemed to me to be quite uplifting... I didn't have a hard time with it and to me it was mind-expanding, literally mind-expanding. So Got To Get You Into My Life is really a song about that, it's not to a person, it's actually about pot. It's saying, I'm going to do this. This is not a bad idea. So it's actually an ode to pot, like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret.\u201d- Paul McCartney Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds was based on a drawing by Julian Lennon that he drew at school and later showed his father. When his father asked about it, Julian told him that he called the picture Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds which was an accurate description of the picture you showed him. \u2018Lucy\u2019 was a friend of Julian's from school and a few years ago when he found out that she had terminal cancer he went and visited her. \u201cI had no idea it spelt LSD. This is the truth: my son came home with a drawing and showed me this strange-looking woman flying around. I said, 'What is it?' and he said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds,' and I thought, 'That's beautiful.' I immediately wrote a song about it.\u201d- John Lennon \u201cThe images were from Alice In Wonderland. It was Alice in the boat. She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty-Dumpty. The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep, and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and I was visualising that. There was also the image of the female who would someday come save me - a 'girl with kaleidoscope eyes' who would come out of the sky. It turned out to be Yoko, though I hadn't met Yoko yet. So maybe it should be Yoko In The Sky With Diamonds. It was purely unconscious that it came out to be LSD. Until somebody pointed it out, I never even thought of it. I mean, who would ever bother to look at initials of a title? It's not an acid song. The imagery was Alice in the boat. And also the image of this female who would come and save me - this secret love that was going to come one day. So it turned out to be Yoko, though, and I hadn't met Yoko then. But she was my imaginary girl that we all have.\u201d- John Lennon 1980 John Lennon found out that people were analyzing Beatles music and wrote 2 songs specifically to mess with the people who are analyzing their music. Those two songs were Glass Onion and I Am the Walrus. \u201cThat's me, just doing a throwaway song, \u00e0 la Walrus, \u00e0 la everything I've ever written. I threw the line in - 'the Walrus was Paul' - just to confuse everybody a bit more. And I thought Walrus has now become me, meaning 'I am the one.' Only it didn't mean that in this song. It could have been 'the fox terrier is Paul,' you know. I mean, it's just a bit of poetry. It was just thrown in like that.\u201d- John Lennon on Glass Onion referencing I Am the Walrus.

            "answer_text": "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is purportedly based on LSD, though the surviving band members may deny it. Other creations which might have been influenced by drug use or contain drug references include: Because, Get Back, The Celebrated Mr. Kite, I Am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields, With a Little Help from my Friends, and so on. This music came about in an era that was rife with experimental drug use, especially among the college-bound, whose views sometimes clashed vehemently with their parents and grandparents. This was also among the most fractious time periods in US from a cultural standpoint, and the music reflects it. The post-WW2 optimism was not long-lived, as troubles in Eastern Asia kept American neocons very busy. As far as the music goes, Ringo Starr has been pretty vocal in interviews about how rehearsals and recording sessions in which band members showed up high were pretty nonproductive. \u201cThe music would sound like sh#t\u201d, I believe he's said. That should be a relief to any aspiring artists, because, let's face it, there really are no rock idols, just as there are no flawless leaders. Every one sins, everyone makes mistakes, and so on. ",
