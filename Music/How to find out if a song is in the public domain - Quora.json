            "answer_text": "google it! typically and it depends what country was it created! If the US was the country the music was published then 1923 is the year which determines pubic domain status. Next year it will be songs created in 1924 and so on. In the United States, any musical works published in 1923 or earlier, in addition to those voluntarily placed in public domain, exist in the public domain. In most other countries, music generally enters the public domain in a period of fifty to seventy-five years after the composer's death. (Public domain rights must be verified for each individual country.) It is important to note the distinction between \"musical works\" (sheet music and other compositions) and \"sound recordings\" (audio files, CDs, records), as almost every sound recording is copyrighted until 2022 unless explicitly placed into the public domain by its creators or rights holders, or it is made by an employee or officer of the United States government acting in an official capacity. Before the Music Modernization Act, the status of copyright on sound recordings in the United States from before such copyrights were nationalized 1972 was somewhat nebulous. The copyrights granted prior to that were considered a state issue and, even if no state law provided for it, some courts established an extra-legal common law copyright, the exact nature of which was inconsistently applied.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! There are a couple of things you can do. First, if it's a new song, it won't be in the public domain. Only songs written prior to 1922 can potentially be in the public domain so if it came out after that it's still copyright protected. Next, http://www.pdinfo.com/public-domain-music-list.php is a pretty nice website that lists a good number of public domain works. You can search alphabetically or by category, including Children's music, Christmas music, Spanish music, and Christian music, among others. You can also search for royalty free music.  If what you're looking for isn't on that site I'd suggest doing a Google search for the song and finding out who the publisher is. They'll have specific info for you. ",
