            "answer_text": "I was \u201cprofessionally singing\u201d during my high school choir freshman year of high school \u2026. Well, at least in the sense of having to rely on my voice nearly every day. That was a while ago, but I still sing along with a lot of the music I listen to, using the breath control that was definitely demanded to do a capella \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d and a few things I\u2019ve learned since then. Anyway, the point is that \u2026 it shouldn\u2019t hurt really. At least if you\u2019re applying some basic training and definitely not abusing your own range. Especially with high notes, not trying to get it through constriction but rather letting yourself shift toward head voice/falsetto. I mean, some songs (like \u201cLet It Go\u201d) can leave my throat somewhat \u201cfeeling it\u201d, but it\u2019s not literally painful. It\u2019s worth noting that, again, \u2026 that\u2019s not my easiest song. That\u2019s a stretch for me. Yet again, breath control as well. Things are easier if you let yourself breathe enough for them (the \u201cquick gasp\u201d almost is especially crucial for when there is relatively little break - and this is also why if the singer in a band\u2019s concert doesn\u2019t have faith they can do the breath well enough in time or if they merely want to conserve their voice overall, they might let the crowd sing the line instead. Yes, I\u2019m revealing that secret of live performances). Also, of course, water is your friend. Keep your vocal tract nice and moist. You\u2019d be amazed how much that can help as well sometimes. Lastly, just don\u2019t overdo anything that IS challenging even with your best technique. There\u2019s only so much your vocal tract muscles can do no matter who you are. Respect your limits! ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, that's one of the things you learn how to do when you take voice lessons. And it takes a fair bit of repetition and solo practice to set the good habits. Failing that, there are online courses, YouTube videos, and books. All part of the mix. I think I have a copy of \u201cSinging for Dummies,\u201d and it looks like a good basic introduction. And it looks like it's fairly easy to come by. Meanwhile, some things you can do without lessons: Get enough sleep.Get enough exercise.Get enough water.Get enough but not too much food.Don't smoke.Don't drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages to excess.Dress to suit the weather.Make sure if you have conditions like asthma and allergies, that you are taking care to treat them.Learn the building blocks of music, if you don't know them, preferably by playing an instrument, particularly one you can sing with. Piano is handy for this, so are guitar and ukulele. The more you know the stuff of music, the less wear and tear you'll put on your voice learning new music.Don't sing without warning up some. My personal favorite warmup us to sing overtones, a la David Hykes, but lip trills, arpeggios, and five-note and 9-note scales are all good, too.Stand with your knees slightly bent, so you can move around a bit even while staying in place.Don't slouch while you're singing.Do all the work from the chest down; from the shoulders up, everything should be relaxed. Picture how a toddler holds her face and imitate that.Regulate your air pressure with the stomach muscles. (When teachers say \u201cSupport from the diaphragm,\u201d that's what they mean.)Open your mouth wider for high notes.That's all I can think of for the moment. ",
