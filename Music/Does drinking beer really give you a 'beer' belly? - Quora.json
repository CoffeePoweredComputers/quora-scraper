            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to differ here. Let\u2019s break some myths here and stop blaming beer for our belly.  Trust us when we say that beer belly is nothing more than a bunk created by some teetotalers who have been sporting the bellies and blaming it on their excessive beer consumption. Most of the times, beer, and fat are used together to justify beer bellies, but the fact is beer does not even contain fat. Every fermented drink that you consume contains calories and not fat, then why we don\u2019t say \u2018wine belly\u2019 or \u2018scotch belly\u2019? Beer lovers come in all sizes and shapes and not all who consume beer carry a pot belly. What Causes Beer Belly? The main cause for your beer belly is not necessarily beer but the calories that you take with it. Calories are any of the alcohol beverage comes directly from the alcohol and nothing else. Liquid Calories can come from anything, wine, bourbon, scotch, vodka, etc. as they all contain alcohol. On an average, a 350ml pint of beer consists of 107 calories and your 40ml vodka, whiskey, tequila or rum, consists of 97 calories. Add the mixers like soda or juice to your drink, and it will become more calorie laden. On the other hand, you do not add any mixer to beer, which means its calories remain static. So, there is no marginal difference in a number of calories you intake with every alcoholic drink. Thus, there is no point blaming only beer for your protruding belly, which might have even be caused because of excess alcohol in other forms. However, if you down several pints in one sitting then obviously you will end up with serious calorie overload. But the same can be said for the excess consumption of alcohol in any other form as well. When you consume alcohol in any form, not only beer, your liver tends to burn alcohol and not fat that you are consuming with it. This leads to fat gain around the midsection, which is often termed as your beer belly. The amount of sugary, processed, fat-laden food that you gulp down with alcohol also contributes to these calories. The oversized portions of food that we indulge on with beer have a particular association with fat accumulation in your midsection. Ironically, a packet of peanuts contains three times more calories than a pint of beer. Bottom Line When consumed in moderation and that too with low-calorie healthy foods, beer can be as good for your health as wine. It contains a number of essential vitamins and minerals that prepare your body to provide protection against problems like diabetes, osteoporosis, and heart diseases. So, instead of blaming occasional beer for your bulging belly, think of bringing significant changes to your lifestyle and diet. Moderation and balance combined with regular exercising are the key pillars to avoid gaining more fat to you mid-section ;) Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t drink but I have lived most of my life around people who drink. Answer is drinking both Beer and any Hard liquor will invariably lead to weight gain. For Beer I believe it\u2019s straight forward that as the starch content/carbs is very high and it\u2019s effect on stomach is easily to be seen if someone has been drinking few cans of beer daily for a while. And what happens with Whiskey etc is that when one is fully drunk it impairs inhibitory control leading to more eating(or atleast unhealthy eating because they may not be caring at that point). This is true for excessive beer drinking too as fried/oily snacks usually go along with it in large quantities. If this behavior continues into mid age it almost always leads to high cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea etc. One can even see around the face widening if the person has been drinking for a while.(called \u2018Puffy face\u2019). Now sure, there may be claims of \u2018controlled casual drinking\u2019 etc, which is like 2 drinks a week and one shot of red wine per week even being good for heart. But that amount of whiskey is considered not even \u2018wetting the throat\u2019, ie \u2018gala vi gilla nahi hoya\u2019 in my culture at least and it\u2019s same across many other drinking cultures from what I have gathered by talking to people about it. So, I haven\u2019t had the fortune to encounter such instances for the most part. Usually \u2018drinking\u2019 works on exponential curve as \u2018fun/recreation\u2019 turns into \u2018crutch\u2019, one would thus see more drinking with time and only few sporadic cases of cutting down or stopping entirely.(unless it\u2019s a Medical advice). In some cases the curve spike is sudden, in others gradual. Because the whole point of drinking is to distract oneself and get a temporary escape from this world and it\u2019s issues as it numbs the senses. ",
