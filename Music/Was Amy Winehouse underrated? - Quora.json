            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little hard to evaluate this in a digital, social media environment. Underrated as an artist? I think the music critics are generally more objective about her work\u2014as they are supposed to be. And for an artist who did some good, sometimes great work in the studio I think she\u2019s rated fairly. Her many recorded live performances range from amazing to WHA\u2026? As a singer she was REALLY talented. And she means a LOT to a lot of people. I just listened to her version of the old reggae nugget \u201cYou\u2019re Wondering Now.\u201d Her vocal is not mainstream, radio friendly. Her love and understanding of that song and its origins are present in her performance; she is not aping the original by Andy and Joey but she KNOWS it and the track sounds both old and contemporary. By no means her best drop but it demonstrates her commitment and talent to the song and where it came from. I am not a huge Amy Winehouse fan but it is tragic that she died without having a chance to share more of her vision and talent, because she had both. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe all musical artists are \u2018rated\u2019 fairly, exactly as much as they deserve to be rated \u2014 no more, no less. So no, Amy wasn\u2019t underrated in my view. Now don\u2019t get it twisted, I think she was very talented and wrote some catchy and strong music. Here\u2019s a numerical fact found over at Amy Winehouse discography - Wikipedia: At the time of her death on 23 July 2011, Winehouse had sold over 1.75 million singles and over 3.98 million albums in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, she had sold about 3.4 million tracks and 2.7 million albums in the United States as of the same date. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of records. Not remotely underrated. ",
