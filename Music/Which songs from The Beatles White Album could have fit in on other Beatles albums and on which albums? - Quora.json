            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to find any songs, after 66\u2019 to fit on any earlier albums, or vice versa from The Beatles!! \u2026. But one from the white album that could fit on any of the Beatles earlier albums is \u2026\u2026..\u201dI will\u201d by Paul. This song never got much attention, because it most likely sounded \u201cdated\u201d at the time and was strictly written by Paul. Which I don\u2019t think the others, especially John, ever liked when one of them did this. I think it was a great song and if it was a few years earlier, there would\u2019ve been harmonies added by John and maybe a little more of a solo by George and a little beat by Ringo!!! \u2026.. this song could have been on any album from 63\u201365\u2019 but I think more like \u201cThis is the Beatles, Beatles for sale or hard days night\u201d. I think it definitely had more of an early sound to it. ",

            "answer_text": "Sgt. Pepper was so revolutionary as the album preceding The White Album (not counting the MMT extended play), that no other songs of The Beatles would be any value on it except Penny Lane & Strawberry Fields Forever which were removed under pressure to be the first 1967 single. The Get Back / Let It Be album experiment was a disaster in retrospect, so I don\u2019t think any of the \u201cWhites\u201d would fit in there, nor on any album preceding Pepper. My original response was going to be \u201cnone\u201d but I think Ringo singing \u201cGood Night\u201d might have worked on Abbey Road, but not as the last song. ",
