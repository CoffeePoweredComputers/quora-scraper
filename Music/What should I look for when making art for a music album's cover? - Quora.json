            "answer_text": "The most important thing is to ask the artist you're collaborating with what they want on their album cover. If they want something you've already produced, give them that. If they want you to create something new, ask them what drew them to your art style and what they're looking for. Help them find a theme that pulls the album together. If you're gonna go big, go massive, otherwise consider simple clean aesthetics that feature a consise image, logo, and/or the artist/band name. If you create a logo, they may use it on other merchandise and future albums, in that case, don't just sell your art as a one off, consider future residuals. Look at albums from the 60s-80s and draw inspiration. The purpose of album art is to draw a potential listeners eye to the album to purchase it. Back in the day, people bought records for the eye candy first, then for the music. Terrible album art can totally ruin record sales. It turns people off. It could be a badass record, but the packaging is what sells or flops it. Due to the digital age, album art fell by the wayside, but I see it becoming popular again with the resurgence of vinyl sales. Know your worth, don't undercut other artists, and don't sell commercial rights to your ideas without a contract. If you're selling to friends or small bands, get a good commission up front, and ask for merchandising cuts if they sell X amount of product. It's your art the people will be wearing. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to express part of the Story of The Artist and or the Music inside. Please don\u2019t just grab some random image off Google and upload that as it isn\u2019t a cover and will hurt you more than you know. Look at record covers that you like and work out why they work well for that record (and there are some great covers that mismatch with the record). Apply that thinking to your record cover. ",
