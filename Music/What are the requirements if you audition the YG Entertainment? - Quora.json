            "answer_text": "Auditioning is very nerve wrecking especially when it comes to the THE 3 BIG COMPANIES. Based on what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re few requirements that i concluded on my own. TALENTS - YG are very strict when it comes to this! If you wanna audition at YGE, you need to make sure that you\u2019re more than good. You can just simply audition because you think you are good enough, you can\u2019t be just good enough at YG Audition. Unlike SM, YG are more focused on talents instead of face, YG are a company that train people to become the best while SM makesure that you\u2019re good looking, and then they make u the bestSPECIALITY - It is important for you yourself to know what makes you different from the other. You need to show them why they need to sign you and not someone else. YG also tend to signed those that are very eye capturing. You have to be confident infront of themMULTI-SPEAKER - If you wanna audition at YG, Korea Entertainment Agency, if you\u2019re foreigners, you need to be able to speak in KOREAN. This is necessary as this may proved to the judges that you have the spirit to actually debut as a k-idol. Also, you need to be able to speak in many languages. Bilingual atleast, The neccessary languages are Japanese, Chinese, English. You need to be able to speak atleast one of those stated bcs being able to speak in many languages will make them think it\u2019s better because they won\u2019t have to train your language ability anymore.Physical state - If you\u2019re really talented enough then i dont think this would be any of a matter to audition at YG, but to secure your position, you need to have a good physical state. YG like those who looks healthy instead of those who look unfit because this can affect ur dance and ur breathing. Make sure ure fit enough and make sure ur dance skills are on top!This is so far the requirements i think might be needed to enter YG. I am not a professional at this but yeah, good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Now I'll \ud83d\udc31 tell u about the top 3 requirements: (1) TALENT: talent is indeed the most important thing. U should have talent more than skills. That means that if u have a beautiful voice which everyone praises, and u have a good rapping ability (hard voice) but u have never taken any formal training and u don't know anything about pitching and breathing so, that will not be an issue (personal experience). Because YG is one of the companies where they have long training sessions and anyone can master vocals in that time. So obviously u need to show them that this is ur inborn talent, and whatever u have done is just natural\u2026but still u can check ur singing and pitching through online apps like I use \u201cLEARN TO SING APP\u201d and it's indeed a great app. (2) CONFIDENCE: u know the best thing about this industry is that they look for confidence more than anything else. Because after debuting u need to have confidence to dance and sing in front of millions of people. So if u r a rapper just show them a different kind of swag and if u r going their as a vocalist then show them a different kind of charm in you and your voice. (3)STAY DIFFERENT: last but not the least. U have to stay different from others like if everyone is showing the same kind of charm or swag then just show something new and different. Show them what u got and if possible just try to tell them that ( they asked me this) WHY U WANT TO BECOME A KPOP IDOL? (Well in most of the auditions they do ask this question but if they don't then just tell them like that only wait until they tell u to leave)Only if u have a good reason because everyone says that they like singing and dancing that's why they want to become this so, just show them some thing new and let them know that ur crazy after this and u r ready to change ur passion into ur profession. Well that's all bye and happy auditioning \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d good luck. ",
