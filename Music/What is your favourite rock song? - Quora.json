            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. My favourite rock songs? Oh my, it's an impossibly long list. The greatest rock songs started with Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and Bill Haley, then through Chubby Checker, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, then the Beatles, the Stones, through to Pink Floyd, AC/DC, KISS, David Bowie, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Queen, Joan Jett, the Ramones, Iggy Pop/Stooges, the Clash, all the way through to today. My list would be hundreds of songs long. Even if I just listed my favourite Beatles songs, I'd still be looking at dozens. Let's label the Beatles, Elvis, Berry, Haley, Domino, and the Stones as essential listening and then put them aside. That's Rock 101 right there. With the above excluded, what I will do is just list what songs are most often on my MP3 player at any given time. The Ramones: Blitzkrieg Bop, Rockaway Beach, Rock and Roll High School, Sheena is a Punk Rocker, Touring, Judy is a Punk, Oh Oh I Love Her So, All is Quiet on the Eastern Front, Come on Now, Rock and Roll Radio, Somebody Like Me, My My Kind of a Girl, Outsider, No Go, Howling at the Moon, Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, Something to Believe In, Somebody Put Something in my Drink, I Believe in Miracles, and pet Sematary. That was just one band. Are you SURE you want the rest of them? Joan Jett: I Hate Myself for Loving You, Nag, Crimson and Clover, Bad Reputation, Do Ya Wanna Touch Me, and I Love Rock and Roll. Pink Floyd: Comfortably Numb, the entire \"Dark Side of the Moon\" and \"Wish You Were here\" albums, Another Brick in the Wall parts 1, 2 and 3, Echoes, Hey You, Run Like Hell, If, In the Flesh?, Mother, Goodbye Blue Sky, and One of These Days. So many others omitted due to lack of space. :-) Also: Elton Motello: Jet Boy Jet Girl, Tutti Frutti Alice.Tenpole Tudor: Her Fruit is Forbidden, One for the MasterAlice Cooper: School's Out, No More Mister Nice GuyQueen: Pretty much everything written by Freddie Mercury.Adam Ant (yes, the pop star did some rock songs): Vive le Rock, and this demo version of Manners and Physique which is done in a rockabilly style:  Sham69: If the Kids Are United, Borstal BreakoutStiff Little Fingers: Alternative UlsterCheap Trick: The entire Buddhokan album, Little Sister, Dream Police, The Flame, Don't be Cruel, and Voices. (Despite their fame, they're still underrated in my view.) Do the Beach Boys count? If so, then I have another dozen or so songs. ",

There are a lot of songs that would be easy to list: Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, YYZ, Spirit of Radio, etc. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love those songs. But, there are two that stand out head and shoulders above the rest to me. For very different reasons. Song 1 (not THE favorite): \u201cThe Wreckers\u201d. This song is one of the final two due to lyrics. \u201cAll I know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knewAll I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, 'cause sometimes the target is you\u201d But, when all is said and done, there can only be one song. \u201cFar Cry\u201d. Specifically, there is one point in the song that will send shivers up and down my spine every time I see/hear it. In the video, it occurs at 2:45. The drumroll leading into the pyro.  ",

            "answer_text": "Since you are speaking of a genre that encompasses many different sounds, instruments, techniques and setups, to ask which rock song would be my favourite would become tricky to answer. Even when I answer this, I fear that it would be too vague to make much sense. Also, rock is one of my favourite music genres so I cannot really pick a favourite unless a concrete category was included. Anyway, here goes. Blackbird - Alter Bridge.  This song manages to capture the essence of rock music without claiming any identity that may hint at being alternative/indie. The lead vocals are soaring and the guitar solos are simply sublime. This band manages to capture the essence of hard rock while not sounding overblown, pomp and archaic. Also, this song deals with the passing of a loved one. This hits much closer to home as I had to deal with a few drug-related and gang-related deaths over the years. I was never the closest but the way it affected my peers, friends and community could never be ignored. ",

            "answer_text": "My absolute favorite rock song is without doubt Bullet the Blue Sky by U2. This song takes me places. It has so many facets, so much raw anger and it\u2019s so beautifully poetic. It\u2019s a very atypical U2 song, but in my opinion, one of their best. It\u2019s from The Joshua Tree, the album that really launched U2. This song stands out like no other between all the other giants (With or Without You, Where The Streets Have No Name (also one of my all-time favorites), I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For). Especially the live versions are the best. 14 - U2 - Bullet the Blue Sky (ZOO TV - Sydney 1993) This one is is from the ZOO TV/Zooropa Tour. U2 - Bullet The Blue Sky | U2: iNNOCENCE + eXPERIENCE Live in Paris (2015) And finally this one is from their latest tour. Notice how different both versions are, both lovely. This song is so intense, it gives me goosebumps every time! Tell me how you feel about it! ",

But also, I love so many songs from other artists as well, like Twisted Sister, KISS, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Here is my playlist: Favourite, a playlist by rhettck02 on Spotify in case you are interested. And if you can\u2019t tell, Alice Cooper is my favourite artist. Just ignore the Michael Jackson if you want, because I know his music isn\u2019t classified as rock, but it\u2019s too good to not mix with my favourite rock artists and songs. ",

It was the early 80s I was a long haired serious metal head and helped a buddies older sis move with my pickup. Later that night after we were done she had me stay, we had drinks and she was totally blown away that I knew the lyrics to all the Elton. I think she saw the metal head and didn't think that I might be well rounded in my music tastes later that night we.... Well you get it. Another one is (this will make my wife happy) Queen. \u201cWe Will Rock You/ We Are the Champions) as soon as I hear that im 13 and hiking with the boyscouts (Im an Eagle Scout) in Southmountain park at night.

Randy Rhoads is behind this beautiful song and, in my honest opinion, it was his best work Metropolis Pt. 1:The Miracle and the Sleeper by Dream Theater- 7 minutes of progressive rock/metal beauty. This has some of the greatest motifs and solo section I've ever heard. One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces by Ben Folds Five - Sheer fun and musical joy. This song is a party and it amazes me how just a 3 piece can make so much noise! Save Me by Avenged Sevenfold - Great arrangements and incredible musicianship make for a beautiful tune and motifs from different song on their album \u201cNightmare\u201d ",

Since today, 30 May 16 is Memorial Day, as a bonus, I'll offer readers links to Fields of Athenry by DKM, one of my favorite songs. The first link is the original. The second link is a ballad that DKM did for SGT Andrew Farrar, USMC, killed in Al Anbar Iraq in 2005. They played this ballad at his funeral and provided all proceeds from the sale of the single to SGT Farrar's familiarly.   One can also find a song called \"Last Letters Hone\" which DKM wrote as a tribute to SGT Farrar. ",

Or \u201cRock,\u201d which is often used to describe Blues-based, mostly Electric-Guitar driven music ? I\u00b4d take to take the second because the first is too vague I\u00b4d think. In that case it might very well be \u201cBoys From Nowhere\u201d by the legendary Norwegian band TURBONEGRO. Judge by yourself:  If you did not resent the imminent desire to drive away from this world riding an imaginary nuclear-fueled motorcycle then I don\u00b4t think you can truly know what ROCK is. \u2026 Or maybe you just have a different taste.
