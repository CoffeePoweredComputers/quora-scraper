            "answer_text": "Not to discredit either of the bands. I personally believe Queen is more talented and impressive than the Beatles, but I prefer the Beatles as they are my favorite band. Queen being right below them. \u201cInfluential\u201d could mean a number of things, so I\u2019m just going to go with popularity that has onset the world. We can say that most everyone in the world knows both Queen and the Beatles. But the trade mark songs for them, there would be abundantly more for the Beatles than Queen. Beatles examples: Here Comes the Sun, All You Need is Love, Hey Jude, Yesterday, Blackbird, I am the Walrus, Twist and Shout, Something, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Eleanor Rigby, Can\u2019t Buy me Love, Paperback Writer, Across the Universe, Penny Lane, When I\u2019m 64, Octopus\u2019s Garden, Yellow Submarine. 19 Beatles songs many people know but didn\u2019t even realize were the Beatles. Or maybe they did. Nonetheless these songs are widely known by many people. Whether they realize they\u2019re Beatles or not. That seems influential in and of itself. Examples for Queen: We are the Champions, We Will Rock You, Somebody to Love, Bohemian Rhapsody, Don\u2019t Stop me Now, You\u2019re My Bestfriend, Killer Queen, Bycicle Race, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, I want it All, Another One Bites the Dust Slightly less, but also songs that are just not as well known as the Beatles listed. Other than the first few. Those Beatles songs have survived through over 30 years of time and are still some of the most popular songs in the world. Not even to mention the endless movies, documentaries, mock bands. Merchandise, more that has been assembled by and for the Beatles. Posters for the Beatles can be found in Walmart\u2019s. I recently stumbled across Beatles hot wheels (a huge cardboard advertisement) in Walmart. 2018, this year. In a Walmart. For children. You simply can\u2019t find merchandise or even a glimpse anywhere else for Queen. Queen\u2019s most famous song was made famous by a movie. The Beatles did this all on their own. Some of the Beatles have been knighted. The day John Lennon was shot has been considered a historical land mark date. Paul McCartneys house is used as a museum. Everyone just by a glance recognizes this photo:  But not this one:  The Beatles have had an \u201cinfluential\u201d impact on the world as being known as perhaps the most famous, well known musical group of all time. I know Queen is having a movie come out about their success, this year in fact. I am incredibly excited about this. I am an avid, loving fan of Queen and I believe they deserve just as much attention and influence as the Beatles. Maybe this movie is why you\u2019re asking this question. Maybe this movie will push Queen to that point with the Beatles. But the Beatles transcended through music, almost reinvented it. Going from pop, to psychedelic to folk to rock, to ballads to everything you could imagine. I will say that Freddie can out sing, out write, out create the Beatles any day. He is by far the most talented singer I\u2019ve ever heard, and the music Queen created was more impressive by leaps and bounds. I would love to tell you that Queen is more influential, by music standards it might be. But the basic truth is no matter who you compare the Beatles to, the Beatles will always be, and always has been, the most \u201cinfluential\u201d, well known. Popular, world changing. You name it. By golly. They changed the world. They certainly did. And even though I love Freddie Mercury; I\u2019m really glad the Beatles stand as the most popular band of all time. ",

            "answer_text": "Many great answers already given. Queen was/is a fantastic band, I love several of their songs. But if there had been no Beatles they, nor most other bands we know today would not even exist. The Beatles were/are the most influential rock/pop band there ever was. Even incredible egotists like Mick Jagger and Keith Richards will say if it weren't for the Beatles they certainly would not be the Rolling Stones as the world knows them. One could even wonder would recording artists even have begun to write their own material or would professional song writers have continued to be the source of the songs they sang? Would singers/bands have much control over what they sang or would managers and music producers make all of those decisions for them? The Beatles were the first to say umm Excuse us but we'll only be doing our own songs from now on, Paul and I or George will be writing them. No thankyou very much it's not up for debate. They convinced Mick and Keith to write their own songs. The Beatles were never content to be complacent in their music, to sit back on their laurels and simply churn out the same old music style over and over, nope they evolved with each new album always different yet always recognizable as the Beatles. They were the inspiration of nearly every genre that both their peers and future musicians played or listened to. They inspired the very musicianship of not only their peers but following generations. If a musician was not directly inspired by them it's a sure bet their inspiration was. The Beatles influence did not begin and end with their musical inspiration however, fashion trends, perceptions of how teens especially saw the world around them and the power we could wield in the world, even segregation in America was affected by their simple refusal to perform to a segregated audience (they weren't trying to make a statement they were only standing by their personal beliefs) the audience was desegregated and they performed to a crowd mixed with black and white together. They weren't trying to make a political statement, a stance and yet they did. The Beatles conquered the whole effing world and did it without firing a single shot. No, they did it by singing a few songs, many of which told us over and over how important love is. Queen was amazing yes, influential probably but more influential than The Beatles? Hardly. But then no one else ever has been. It's unlikely anyone will be again any time soon. It would actually be nice if some obscure band would come forward and take up baton and carry it forward. The youth of today could really use a modern version of The Beatles, an inspiration to make them see past the \u201cme\" which seems to prioritize so many of them and the world definitely could use the same. The old guard is growing old and weary. So short answer: The Beatles were more influential than Queen.   ",
