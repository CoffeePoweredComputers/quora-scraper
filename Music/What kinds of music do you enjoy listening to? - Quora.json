            "answer_text": "I often listen to Korean and Japanese Pop, with some older American Rock, House, Video Game OSTs, and Musical (music from musical plays) music sprinkled in here and there. In regards to K and J pop, I listen to them while doing something that I have to focus on, because for the most part, I don't understand the lyrics, but the music is still enjoyable so I get the best of both worlds. When I want to find out what the ideas behind the songs are, I just look up the translations. Another cool thing is that these 2 genres have multiple sub-genres. There are such things as K and J rock, and K and J Hip-Hop. There is a load of variety in these genres, and huge fanbases where you can meet a lot of cool people. American Rock I got into because of a lot of video games I played that had some songs from that era in their soundtracks. For example, Rising Storm 2: Vietnam had the song \u201cRun Through the Jungle\u201d by Creedence Clearwater which I listen to pretty regularly. Exploring similar music helped me find other music from the Vietnam War era, which I really enjoy. Another part of Rock that I got into (Not American though) was the Beatles, because my Mom would always listen to them and I came to like some of the songs there. Again, in exploring further past the Beatles\u2019 music, I found The Rolling Stones, and other artists of that era. For Video Game OSTs, I listen to the soundtracks of games that I really loved or had a large emotional impact on me. Most of the time, its games that I played relentlessly until I finished them, and loved every second of. Some examples are the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time soundtrack, Persona 5, and multiple of the Pok\u00e9mon battle songs for trainers, wild pokemon, gym leaders, etc. These tend to not have words, so they are great for focusing as well. Finally, theater music. I enjoy doing theater outside of school and have seen and enjoyed many musicals. This category really doesn\u2019t need much explanation, and mostly consists of songs that I heard in musicals, and enjoyed If you see any genres that you are interested in at all, feel free to ask me for suggestions and I would be happy to suggest you some!

            "answer_text": "Most of my favorite music is from people who are currently old men: The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Billy Joel, Cat Stevens. Cat Stevens music makes me want to nuzzle into Cat Stevens bosom. My parents also had the Beach Boys album \u201cMade in the USA\u201d and I listened to it 9,500 times in my youth. My real favorite music is every Alan Menken song from the Disney movies where he did the music. I had an Aerosmith phase and a Pearl Jam phase and a Dave Matthews phase and a Bob Marley phase. I had an odd one-week Peter Tosh phase and even though I never listened to Peter Tosh before or after that one week, I often have the song Legalize It in my head today, like 20 years later, even though it\u2019s not a good song and I don\u2019t care about pot. I may occasionally enjoy the shit out of that first Alanis Morrissette album. I\u2019m a sucker for Elton John just like everybody else. Motown is delightful. I had a super dark one-day, 8-hour K-pop phase where I watched a Hyuna video 19 times. I like that Moby song Porcelain and the song Bittersweet Symphony because they both go from the 1 chord down to the 5 minor chord. So does the song Clocks by Coldplay which is why I like that song. I love Paranoid Android by Radiohead. Thunder Road by Springsteen. God Only Knows by the Beach Boys. I listened to the song There\u2019s Your Trouble by the Dixie Chicks on repeat for like two hours once. Enya makes me want to dance around on a cloud holding a spray bottle of water where I float around by spraying it in the air and everything\u2019s refreshing. I had a brief Sigur Ros phase which made me want to run naked through a field in Scandanavia with long hair. I love a lot of instrumental music. Sometimes classical, but more often film scores like anything by John Williams or Thomas Newman or Alan Silvestri or Danny Elfman. Especially obsessed with the scores from Shawshank, Forrest Gump, Jurassic Park, ET, JFK, and Back to the Future. I love Aaron Copeland. I like Philip Glass when he\u2019s not being one notch too thrilled with himself. I love a lot of Broadway musical music. Full sucker for Les Mis. Love Fiddler on the Roof and Avenue Q. Saw Hamilton when it just opened back when people hadn\u2019t full freaked out yet and loved it. There\u2019s some guy named Gonzalez who plays the piano I think with his foot on the quiet pedal who comforts me. ",

            "answer_text": "Started out with SPM (South Park Mexican), Lil Rob and other Chicano rap when I was 5\u20137 years old. Then came rock music. System of a down and rock radio was all I heard. The drums and the vocals on system of a down made me want to look for heavier stuff. Playing tony hawk underground 2 with Lamb of God screaming and the song Black label had a (kinda) fast kick drum sound. I liked it. Searched their songs and loved it. Then I heard Killswitch engage. The growling sounded awesome as did the drums. I found a girl on RuneScape who we talked and became friends through Myspace. Looked at her page and all I heard was suicide silence. My God, I got a boner and spilt some seeds. Bludgeoned to death was planning. I never knew Google for awhile and I wanted to know what genre I was listening to. I searched and found more bands. Chainsaw Disaster became my first favorite. All the growling and screaming and the fast paced kickers got my hooked like Korean gamers who play to death! Eventually I got bored after finding the mainstream deathcore bands like Oceano, Thy Art is Murder, Suicide Silence, and decided to just listen to random rock music. I went from rap to deathcore as I grew up and realized I wanted to get back to rap. Luckily I found the bass in trap sounds to be just as awesome as the kicks in deathcore. The growling wasn't present enough but it had good vocal Melodies. Bones, sometimes screams, and I like his songs. Xavier wolf, Chris Travis were what I liked. The underground type music is my favorite now. Not just for vocals or bass or whatever. It was different than what most zombies like. Of course I listened to trance or dance or whatever Bass Hunter was. In my search for new rock+mixed genres I found Nintendocore. Omfg, this was lethal. One dose of this genre and your nostalgic video game favorites start to flood you with oxytocin. Monomate and 100dead(rabbits) were the only choices I listened to. Some others songs by different bands as well. Now.. I listen to anything that tickles my melodic ears. I love beautiful Melodies. They're what the soul can't express in words. Weather if be vocal, guitar, or bass (sometimes), I find any genre with a good Melody (like black Beatles, even though I rarely like mainstream) to be fitting for me. I create some of my own since 2009 but my favorite songs I've created didn't survive my system restore. I forgot my password and geez.. there goes about 2 years of making Nintendocore.. which I like because of the light chip tune sound. Tell us what you used to like OP! ",

I listen to most kinds of metal (extreme varieties like black metal, death metal, but also prog metal, goth metal, nu metal, alternative metal and older stuff like Black Sabbath), a lot of jazz (mainly fusion and free jazz but I\u2019m also fond of bop, hard bop, post bop and whatnot), industrial (early stuff like Throbbing Gristle, Skinny Puppy, metal-crossover stuff like KMFDM and Ministry), hardcore punk (really only Black Flag though), a wide variety of rock (oldies like Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, newer alternative stuff like the Pixies, Animal Collective, a bit of grunge, the Cranberries, Ween, Frank Zappa, Genesis, a lot of shoegaze, basically every style except for hard rock like Shinedown, that stuff bores me), folksy stuff like Simon and Garfunkel and Vashti Bunyan, trip-hop like Portishead and Massive Attack, a bit of 90\u2019s hip-hop (love Stone\u2019s Throw), a lot of goth music (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Evanesence, Collection D\u2019Arnell-Andr\u00e9a), anything by Astrud Gilberto, Bj\u00f6rk, Kate Bush, Yma Sumac, Annie Lennox (I listen to a lot female singers), a bit of eurodance (Caramell, Bambee), dark cabaret (Sulfur), and a lot of electronic music (Venetian Snares, Aphex Twin, Black Dog, The Orb). Mostly I listen to 90\u2019s music, not by choice but I\u2019ve noticed that\u2019s when most of the music I like is from. So, I listen to a LOT of music. Today alone I\u2019ve listened to some Lio (Italian disco-house type stuff), Yellow Magic Orchestra (Japanese electronic), and some Robert Fripp (his first solo, Exposure). However, I certainly don\u2019t listen to, or like \u201cit all,\u201d and I don\u2019t think anyone can say they do, either. Anyone who thinks they do doesn\u2019t know the sheer vastness of music on this planet. People are creative! ",

            "answer_text": "I love music. I have a broad variety of music that I listen to every day. The first and the most that I listen to is pop music. Modern pop music or the 90's pop music, I love them all. I also listen to the rock music which is not really heavy metal music but the easy listening rock music. Classical music also fills my day with joy and weird feeling like I could fly into the sky when I listen to it especially Mozart, the classical music has its own special something that can intrude into my ears and brain. Jazz music. Yes jazz music is also somehow waking up something in your soul that you cannot understand, the heavy jazz or the easy listening jazz or the modern jazz, I don't know all of them can give you something chill and cool at the same time but also making you intelligent at the same time. I listen to Jazz when I want to get relaxed, or really stressed out so I need a cure by listening to the jazz music. I am a Christian. I listen to praise and worship songs which is mostly slow and that goes to worship songs that can really connect me to God, Jesus Christ. The praise songs also making me eager to have a joy life to worship Him. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a wide array of musical tastes, but I would call my 3 primary tastes \u201cnew wave\u201d, \u201cmetal\u201d and \u201calternative\u201d. You can argue that \u201calternative\u201d can encompass the other two, but I personally think of it as a way to describe modern pop music that doesn\u2019t try to get on Top 40 radio stations. \u201cMetal\u201d is more focused on a stylistic sound, as is \u201cnew wave\u201d. Now that being said, I dislike most of the metal music that I hear. Bands don\u2019t do much to sound different than other bands (one of my favorite moments to laugh at a metal band was while watching the video for \u201cGuardians of Asgaard\u201d by Amon Amarth and seeing that there were two vocalists for that song, and I hadn\u2019t noticed that in previous listens to it). Yes, it\u2019s a dismissive stereotype, but it\u2019s just as true as it is a stereotype. I like metal that gets my attention in some way. I can hear one segment of a song that stands out from the most cookie-cutter of a song and it will make me check out the rest of the bands output. I don\u2019t ask for much, just get my attention, and most metal fails at doing so. \u201cNew wave\u201d is a style of music I can safely listen to in order to have something playing in the background that won\u2019t annoy me for whatever reason some piece of music will annoy me. I have some favorites in this genre, but it generally doesn\u2019t excite me as much as \u201cmetal\u201d can. \u201cAlternative\u201d is decent background music, but there will be songs that come up on the radio that will cause me to immediately change the channel or turn it off just to not hear the affront to all of humanity (I\u2019m pointing at you, Cheryl Crow and Kid Rock, for your abomination of a song \u201cWhite Trash Love Song\u201d\u2026 or is it called \u201cPicture\u201d\u2026 I forget) ",

            "answer_text": "I like quite a large variety of genres. For starters, I like soundtrack/movie music. A big part of it is definitely that I am one of those people whos imagination can go wild when listening to music but I think that while this kind of music is definitely better within its intended context e.g a movie scene, some of them can be good on their own. Believe it or not I like some anime soundtracks particularly those from the anime bleach. I don\u2019t think any other anime tops them. Bleach has a huge variety in kinds of music. For example, who would have thought that an ANIME would have amazing flamenco guitar music? Seriously this stuff is just on point. I like flamenco music in general but I think the stuff they do in Bleach is my fav.   Some more soundtracks I like from Bleach             Wolfenstein soundtracks   I also like traditional Japanese music some of the stuff from total war Shogun 2 is amazing. You can imagine a battle taking place in your head as they play.        These last two are interesting because they have a 19th century feel to them. I also enjoy the soundtracks from Medieval II total war  And medieval inspired/medieval music depending on my mood.   the soundtracks from Red Dead are also pretty well done IMHO    I\u2019m not quite sure what genre this one is but I like this one as well  Finally for soundtracks, Two Steps from hell has amazing stuff    Finally, I like some metal, but I am really more of a rock guy hard rock, alternative etc. Some bands I like include Egypt Central   Atreyu     I also like Disturbed  Sum 41   Three days Grace    Bad Wolves (particularly this song they actually did it better than the original IMHO)  Scorpions  Breaking Benjamin  Linkin Park (RIP Chester)   Thousand foot Krutch  My favourite of all of them is Skillet.     Lastly, Mongolian throat singing can be pretty kick ass. I listen to the HU sometimes.   I listen to many other genres depending on my mood as well but this is generally the stuff I listen to. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a rocker first and foremost! but I will listen to anything that catches my ear. I think for me I gravitate toward guitars, I\u2019m old school so I still have a thing for guitar oriented music. The other I go for, is lyrically what is the song saying? is they\u2019re a meaning or a story behind It? Here\u2019s an example I think the name of the song is \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d from the album Whitey Ford sings the blues by Everlast. It\u2019 not an all rocked up song, but it tells a great story, with some pretty decent guitar at the end. The 3rd thing I go for is how the song is orchestrated or arranged, There\u2019s 2 here I can think of \u201c(Oceans) Where Feet May Fail\u201d by Hillsong United. There\u2019s several live versions, you can turn the song off after 4 minutes, because it just keeps repeating the last phrase, but the way that song is done just kind of grabs me. Another one similar in nature is \u201cRevelation Song\u201d by Kari Jobe. I think there are 2  other groups doing this one as well, but she\u2019s probably best known. Same thing it\u2019s just the way the song is done, this one does have some good guitar in it, and after about 4 or 5 minutes it will get redundant. These are 2 songs that grabbed me not for the guitar or the story they were telling, but simply the way they\u2019re I guess musically written. These are just some songs I used as examples to illustrate my different perspectives. The truth is, there\u2019 too many to list, depending on if you like guitar or not Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d album, and most of those are telling a story. Any way that\u2019s enough for now, hopefully you\u2019ve been turned on to some music you may not have been aware of.  Enjoy and Thanks Robert ",

Huge Chili Peppers fan over the years \u2014 Nirvana, Pantera, and Soundgarden forever (no hope of anything new though.) For variety and discovery I used to play basically every song on MuchMusic's Big Shiny Tunes 1 through 10. Some great songs on them. I'll tell you what I do not listen to, which is a better question anyway: Anyone of the surname Cyrus incl Billy (or Montana obv.)Anything that is on the radio today.All your boybands, including the main talent from each one, who inevitably go solo because \u201cthey feel the band is holding back their true potential.\u201dAnything written by Max Martin or Lucas Gottweild. (What? You've never heard of these guys? That's no accident; they wrote the majority of the hits of the 21st century. All your Beyonces and boybands record their songs, and they're content to let \u201cthe artists\u201d claim IP on these songs \u2014 they are VERY well compensated.We used to talk about cookie cutter bands, and the recording industry formula: when you find a moneymaking group, you sign up 100 more bands just like them, and maybe a dozen more will hit paydirt. Today they've got the formula reduced to finding super talents who create all the music, and using that music to prop up a person with THE LOOK or the X Factor. We can thank MTV for saving rock n roll from disco, but it was a double edged sword\u2026 now personality and looks is as important as the music. :( ",

Modern rap- Is about drugs- Sex- Money, and they will straight up call the people who listen to their music pieces of shit and all they see them as is money, they also seem to have a thing for portraying women as sex objects and nothing more, oh and gangs (never understood what was so cool about being in a gang).. Modern Pop- Don\u2019t even get me started- its the same as above just with faster rhyme lyrics. Those two are the most common Hell even a lot of rock bands aren't as good But Boy Bands are the worst. So that being said I\u2019ll listen to old rap, rock, metal (mostly metal), jazz, and classical music, hell ill listen to anything really as long as it isn\u2019t like above. But really I just hate how people portray themselves now, sex drugs, money, gangs, guns, and just being really disrespectful. Also it seems to have a really bad impact on kids my age, they are really rude, they wave guns around like they are toys, just like in the music videos, and they act like their \u201cthugs\u201d and shit. Music has hit a new low. I mean really people like shit where a guy goes \u201cGucci Gang\u201d like 1 billion times.  fuck this guy, literally no talent at all. ",

Later Mid to late 90s pop songs were really influential while growing up further. Then during high school it was mostly Indie Pop/Pop Rock like KailasaJalStringsJunoonRaghu Dixit projectBolly movie Rock songs etc.Then coming into Graduation phase I was introduced to the genre and sub genres of Rock and metal. I also started getting into Indian rock bands like MotherjaneAvialAgneeThe Down troddenceBhayanak MautSkyharborGoddess GaggedKaavBlackstratbluesThen I further starting exploring bands around the world such as Anathema, Katatonia, Opeth,Porcupine Tree, Steven Wilson. I also listen to a lot of bangla rock. i can understand Bengali fairly well. And I have listened to bengali bands like Bhoomi,Prachir,Fossils etc. And also it\u2019s worth mentioning I listen to a lot of Bangladesh based metal and rock bands such as Warfaze, Aurthohin etc. Also searching for ambient and soothing music I came across Post-Rock music. And honestly if You want some peace in life, even 1% peace\u2026 Post-rock is the music You should go for. I came across bands like God Is An Astronaut, This Will destroy You, Mogwai, We Lost The sea,Frames etc. From there itself my love for instrumental music become a constant. I also liked listening to Steve Vai and Joe Satriani music. Later I became a huge fan of Buckethead\u2019s guitar playing and music. I also came across Carbon Based Life Forms who compose ambient soothing electronica music..And honestly that music by CBLF is the best medicine You can ever get\u2026!! And then around the end of graduation, and towards post graduation phase I got introduced to progressive metal . And i started listening to bands like PeripheryVeil Of MayaPliniEmpires FadeVoices From The FuselageVolumesAnimals As LeadersHeavy Metal NinjasTexturesAfter The BurialJakub ZyteckiUneven StructuresTesseractThis list is just what i listen to regularly.But I keep adding new artists and music as i come across them. I also listen to old bollywood songs by Kishore Kumar,Mukesh etc and also like to listen to Jagjit Singh Ghazals. I will also share the links of one song for each artist I mentioned. because I believe good and beautiful music should be heard by everybody. So here we go. Kailasa-Teri Deewani  Strings-Duur  Junoon-Sayonee  Mekaal Hasan Band-Rabba  Raghu Dixit-Ambar Se  Agnee-Shaam Tanha  Blackstratblues-Nights in Shining Karma  Avial-Chekele  TDT-Shiva  Motherjane-Chasing the sun  Kaav-Daya  Goddess Gagged- Dreamer  Skyharbor-Blindside  Anathema-one last goodbye  Katatonia-My Twin  Steve Vai-Tender Surrender  Opeth-Credence  GIAA-Echoes  Volumes -Up All Night  Empires Fade  Veil of Maya-Mikasa  Periphery-Scarlett  Jakub Zytecki-Satya\u2019s diary  Uneven Structures-Frost  Voices from the fuselage- Wreckage  Textures-Reaching home  Heavy metal Ninjas-Design  CBLF-Hydroponic Garden  After The Burial-Neo Seoul  Tesseract- Retrospect  These are all beautiful and amazing music.

            "answer_text": "Argggh\u2026what a difficult question. I love sci-fi; not shoot \u2019em ups in space though, nor dystopias. I like there to be something to learn from a book. Some real science, or a new way of looking at things, or a paradoxical idea that will keep me thinking. Dan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion, Gene Wolfe\u2019s Fifth Head of Cerberus, Horselover Fat\u2019s Valis - oh frabjous joy that the world contains such masterpieces! But\u2026wait\u2026. What about Terry Pratchett? I love Terry Pratchett, and he is writing something more like fantasy than sci-fi. Harry Potter too, that is more like fantasy. And Douglas Adams - his Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is my all-time favourite book, but whatever genre is that? And Jodi Taylor\u2019s not time travel series The Chronicles of St Mary\u2019s is surely humorous sci-fi. It made me cry one or twice all the same. Oh, but\u2026 I love Tom Robbins\u2019 work: I read Jitterbug Perfume a couple of months ago and it is still affecting my life now\u2026whatever genre is his writing? I love his Skinny Legs and Fierce Invalids too, but can\u2019t place any of them in a category. That reminds me of Hal Duncan\u2019s Vellum: The Book of All Hours. Sinister and filled with ancient deities - does that make it fantasy? It seems like more than this. Another fantasy author is Nick Starfields, a pen name of Silvia Hartmann. Her series In Serein contains subtle hypnotic effects and possibly something like real magic, coming from within ourselves. I loved this series despite the lack of editing. Hartmann believes in catching the flow of the words without examining them too closely, you see. But she can certainly write a good story. Kurt Vonnegut - I adore Kurt Vonnegut! Is his writing sci-fi or something else? Surely Slaughterhouse Five is mostly historical fiction, or maybe not even fiction at all\u2026yet Cat\u2019s Cradle is clearly a sort of apocalyptic or maybe satirical sci-fi, and I love that too. \u2026and then there are Cryptonomicon and Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson - are these historical fiction or fantasy? Or what about Robert Anton Wilson? His Illuminatus and Schrodinger\u2019s Cat Trilogies are utterly wonderful - but how do I put them into a genre? You see my problem with your question? Many of my favourite books do not fall neatly into this or that genre. They are individuals, each book a work of art lovingly crafted to perfection. It is the same with non-fiction. The book I am studying closely at the moment is called Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm. Is it biology? Is it psychology? Is it spirituality? I don\u2019t know. I do know that it makes perfect sense to me, but Richard Dawkins wouldn\u2019t like it. ",

Metalcore (usually has a clean and a guttural vocal mix) eg: Mikasa by Veil of Maya  Tech Metal eg: Deadweight by Heart of a Coward  Deathcore usually has pretty flat monotone gutturals eg: The Son of Misery by Thy Art is Murder  Industrial is a pretty big sound but fairly simple music wise eg: Rammlied by Rammstein (live)  Black Metal is what many people mistake as death metal (there is a difference) eg: Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel by Behemoth  I listen to many more sub-genres and different styles but these are the ones that have changed my life the most and I enjoy seeing live the most!:) ",

I really didn't know or care so much about other genres until my mid-teens\u2026started expanding my horizons little by little and listening to Spanish music, jazz, and classic rock. It wasn't until my early \u201920s that I REALLY opened my mind to a vast catalog of genres\u2026funk, alternative, glam rock, indie, ambience, and so many others. Now, I pretty much have an eclectic taste in music styles. I mostly listen to artists who are unafraid to take risks and think outside the box in regards to their sound. The only one that I won\u2019t listen to is country\u2026too twangy and mediocre for me. ",

            "answer_text": " I usually like to listen to R&B because of its atmospheric feels and the usage of melisma in it that just never ceases to amaze me. Another thing to like about R&B is its lyricism since they talk about issues that are present in the society that ranges from the government to the music industry and then to love that is not that evident in mainstream music. The usual type of R&B I listen to is the one that infuses trap or instruments in a band since I really love the implemention of bass in music. The thing about great masterpieces and artists in the genre is that most of them are underrated, although I usually like music that are underrated due to the fact that they are not overplayed. I really would like the genre to be recognized and appreciated by more people since they produce content that are usually missed by people since they are being advertised with these mainstream music that have the conplacent content that are very overplayed. This is why I suggest that we should try to explore more and delve into the lyrics rather than just enjoying the beat. I would also like to say that any genre suits me since I am open to different sounds but R&B has an edge to me since I am addicted to what it has to offer. I\u2019ll leave you with a list of songs if you want to explore good R&B music that has lyricism. Cold Sweat by TinasheHigh Highs To Low Lows by Lolo Zoua\u00efBlue Lights by Jorja SmithChanel by Frank OceanNuh Time / Tek Time by dvsnPigment by H.E.R.Blessed by Daniel CaesarThe first two songs are coming from artists that I stan, the others I guess you can say I'm a fan of them Bonus songs since I really like to recommend music: Lose Control by JOY.Seventeen by No RomeOpen Arms by PRETTYMUCHHowling by RY XMessages From Her by Sabrina ClaudioGirl by The Internet ft. KAYTRANADAIf you do have music recommendations that are similar to these please do let me know as I am always exploring new music and would be very delighted to be introduced to artists that I may have never knew before.

I was searching for deep meaning music\u2026 like it has some intense harmony that can give you goose bumps. With the journey of search, I've found ROCK with Linkin Park. It was a bomb for me. Still I was so curious, I wasn't satisfied. Then my friend introduced me to METAL. Yeah\u2026 this music took my mind off, still does. The journey didnt stop. After a while, I was more turning to atmospheric melodic metal bands like INSOMNIUM, BEFORE THE DOWN, WOLFHEART. Now interesting part comes here, I was in hunger for more. Searching on youtube for sad depressing music. And I've found POST-ROCK. Finally, the music that satisfies the soul, so deep, so intense, so emotional. Kinda took me to another dimension. You can check some popular bands on YouTube - Hammock, God is an astronaut, explosion in the sky, helios. Those are some beautiful post rock bands. With proper EQ and volume, you will feel what you want to. Still I am searching for the best music genres and I wont rest still. ",

I love everything from 70s light rock, disco, ballads; pretty much all 80s music except heavy metal) I ESPECIALLY love 80s pop music; musicals, dance, R&B, rap, hip hop, ambient, classical, soul and jazz. However, the music I love the absolute most and that's had the biggest influence on my life and still does is electronic/dance/club/DJ music, most of which seems to generate from the UK. There are currently very few American artists I count amongst my favorites but I'm always open to and seeking really good, innovative and original music regardless of its origin. My all-time favorite artist is, by far, George Michael (RIP). I love everything he's ever recorded and am still saddened over the loss of such a massive talent with the voice of an angel. I do not like country/western nor heavy metal music. I've tried but it does nothing for me. ",

Also, if you happen to listen to every one of these songs I listed, and tell me your favorite, I\u2019d love you forever.  For example, I like \u201cPlastic Love\u201d by Mariya Takeuchi despite not knowing any Japanese. I like the melody, and I think she has a nice voice, not to mention I like to listen to music I can\u2019t understand when I\u2019m studying so I don\u2019t lose focus.  I also like \u201cBlack Smoke Rising\u201d by Greta Van Fleet, since it has a lot of old school rock vibes, despite these guys being about my age.  Of course, I absolutely adore Jimi Hendrix, \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d being a personal favourite of mine.  Then there\u2019s Prince\u2019s \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d.  \u201cLocation\u201d by Khalid.  And stuff like \u201cHuman\u201d by Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.   This barely even covers my music taste, but it\u2019s stuff I like, so there\u2019s that. ",

I also enjoy listening to covers, disregarding the song it is. Generally any form of piano I will enjoy, but I do like anime covers. EDM I grew up listening to EDM, electro and house, and it still sticks with me today, but I listen to this less frequently now. Great way to get in the flow of life. Recs: Flight, Anime Bae, and Say My Name (Tatsuro remix). Pop A rollocoster for me. This was my main music to listen to back when I was younger, and while I still enjoy listening to some pop songs, it\u2019s starting to get too blunt or repeitive, or just plagued with memes *cough* BAD AND BOUJEE *cough*. Recs: Dusk \u2018Till Dawn, 1\u2013800, Location, Unforgettable Alternative Rock Literally the only reason I put this here, is because of this artist called \u201cEden\u201d. Just listen to him\u2026 Recs: Every damn song from him Acoustics Similar to piano, its quite relaxing, and because I usually listen to covers when listening to acoustics, it implements depth and complexity and a whole new take of the song being covered. Very soothing as well. Try out Eric Bellinger\u2019s Fake Love acoustic cover. K-pop Well, I intially didn\u2019t like the \u201ccraze\u201d of k-pop, but giving it some time, it has grown on me a lot. Its heavily inspired a lot by general pop, but with Korea\u2019s intrinsic twist on it. Rec groups: BTS, EXO, Blackpink, Seventeen, Got7, Day6 (thanks Aimie, Trista and Sophia for introducing me into this, even though I\u2019m 99.99% sure you won\u2019t see this, hopefully) R&B and hip pop Ah, these music genres is starting to redefine a lot of what I think. Sounds complicated and vauge, because it is complicated and vauge\u2026 Having a heavy bass line with a rhythmic beat and snare is just perfect. Gets you in the mood. Rec artists: Chance the Rapper, Blackbear, Drake, Post Malone, 6lack But honestly, I\u2019ll listen to anything. If it resembles music, then I\u2019m calling it music. ",

It tends to talk about things like how rich the writer is, how good of a life they lead, and how expensive their car is. For the most part, modern music has simply become an opportunity to flaunt your lifestyle which is probably an act anyways. To the point though, I generally listen to game soundtracks. Call me a nerd all you want, but the soundtracks of Skyrim and Undertale are some of my favourites. The portray the mood of the situation perfectly, and they are worth a listen even if you don't want to play the games they are associated with. I reccomend The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST - Journey's End, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST - Far Horizons, Undertale OST - Undertale Extended, and Undertale OST - Bonetrousle Extended. (Keep in mind that while the others are ambiances, Bonetrousle is a battle theme, so it might not be as good for background noise.) Keep on thinking, Joseph ",

For me their songs are so cute, but I have realised that most of the ones I like tend to have sad lyrics and very deep lyrics. I have heard that the lyrics of the songs you love have the words you want to tell everybody (or someone in particular), and I think it makes sense in some aspects, because I feel a bond with music and I feel what it says as if it were my own story, and I tend to associate all with my reality. Regarding to rhytms, Korean musicians try everything and are always pleased to discover and make different music. I admire some writers and compositors from this business a lot, they really inspire me. Appart from this, I like how do the words in this language sound, if you try korean music, you will easy notice the way they are pronounced and you will like them. Moreover, almost every modern korean song has a choreography, so if you like a lot a song, learning its choreography will be another way of expressing your feelings towards it. ",

My answer made me look younger than I am\u2026 because ABBA and Boney M. fans were the first two groups I remember hating each other; and while Pink Floyd is older than me, the rivalry between the fans (not the bands!) couldn\u2019t start before Dire Straits was formed.

They start as an alternative rock band, but constantly experimenting they style in each album they release. You can notice it easily from Pablo Honey to The Bends, the move to OK Computer where they start to incorporated electronic music into their song. Electronics feel become more dominant in their subsequent album KID A and Amnesiac, and the three album remain (All Hail To The Thief, In Rainbow, and King of Limb) give you another different taste.  I can't explain it technically but I do love to hear most of their pieces, although some few of them are very hard to listen-and-enjoy. ",

Just like listening to slow music to calm the body, music can also have a relaxing effect on the mind. Music also has transformative powers. The combination of rhythm and melody has a tremendous ability to influence our minds. When we are listening to a piece of music with a slow rhythm, in a major key, with no harsh elements, it can bring us to a more relaxed and soothing place.

I was lucky to have grown up when thrash metal had just come on to the scene because when that came out it was just out of this world different than what was being played at the time and I was in love with it instantly. So I would definitely have to say for me that I enjoy metal but not all because some of it doesn't make sense or it sounds like mud. But even with that being said it all depends on the mood that I'm in. I can go from listening to really good old classic rock to grunge/ alternative to metal. If I'm on a long drive I put the ipod on and shuffle through a playlist that I put together which would include a mix of all of that but again most of it would be on the heavy side ",

What I mean is, if I come across some song or lyrics which got my attention I add it up in my playlist and then listen to it. I don't judge the song for the very first time itself after I hear it, I give it a day or two to let it sink in. If after that I feel like listening to it, that becomes permanent and the remaining, well, I need to free the useless memories of my devices as well. Having said that, there are a few band whose songs I try not to miss namely Poets of the Fall and Alter Bridge. There are some more but to be specific these two are the ones which I like the most. In general there is no such specific that drives me crazy for the good ones, if I found my way to them, always gets my respect. ",

Speaking in korean in normal conversation,giggling at handsome/pretty idols &etc; so embarrassing.

Before I go for a run, I listen to fast-paced music, sometimes when I\u2019m chilling, accordingly music changes. Many people like to listen to music while studying. I find it difficult to focus on two things at the same time. Hence I have separate time slots for both. Even though my mother tongue is Hindi, I don\u2019t enjoy contemporary Hindi music. Kishore Kumar is my all-time favorite. Other artists that I like are Mohammad Rafi, Arijit Singh, Amit Trivedi. Apart from these, I also listen to EDM, Rap music. ",

Anything from Jagjit Singh to Wadali brothers makes my day. Although other genres have their own pros, but at the end of a long day, only a classical music refreshes me. At times I listen to rock music. Not for those harsh vibrations, but for the lesson hidden in those lyrics. My playlist ranges from Pink Floyd to the 90s Bollywood music. Also the occasion and your company matter a lot. If you're with a bunch of stoners, a Pink Floyd playlist will make everyone comfortable. At the same time, if dining with your parents, a light gazhal will make you a sanskari guy. Happy listening. ",
