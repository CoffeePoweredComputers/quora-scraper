            "answer_text": "Yes of course. You may want to add a mixer so you can balance guitar and voice to/as your audio. You could also just use an amp behind you with only one mic for your voice as well but, if you want to make a really good professional impression, then I would go the extra mile and use a mixer. If you are using an acoustic guitar it\u2019s even more important. There are multiple options of mixing mics and guitar into a computer for sound and that device would be your audio choice for zoom instead of the built in mic. I use a Motu audio interface and also a ZOOM (not related) TAC-2 product that allows two inputs. It works very well. ",
