            "answer_text": "This is a close one. Till today (28.07.17) See you again has 2.965 Billion views and Despacito has 2.842 Billion. But Despacito is being watched around 20 million times a day compared to See you again which is watched around 5 million times a day. So from these stats, it will take See you again around 13 days to reach 3 Billion but Despacito would most probably have crossed 3 Billion mark by then (since with the present rate it will take only 8 days for Despacito to reach 3 Billion views).As far as Gangnam Style is concerned, it\u2019s current rate (2\u20133 million views/day) might not be enough to reach 3 Billion first.
