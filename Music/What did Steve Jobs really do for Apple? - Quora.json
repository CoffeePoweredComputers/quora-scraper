            "answer_text": "Your question is quite broad. What did Steve do for Apple at what point in time? You could venture back to the beginnings of the company when Woz and Jobs were going to HomeBrew and sharing what Woz had created, and Steve was thinking how to put $\u2019s in their pockets. You could move forward to when Apple was on the ground ready to dive into the abyss and Jobs while at Pixar was moved to think about resurrecting the company to greatness. You could accelerate into the future and look at iPod, iPhone, iPad and understand that Jobs was welcoming the world into the new way of working with technology in a broad sense of touching and swiping. Steve Jobs had a vision for a company that would do more than just create computers for the masses. He had a thought of a company that would create technology for the world that would allow users to quickly get tasks done, and to do so with ease. Jobs also had a knack of seeing in people the greatness within themselves and inspiring them to dig deeper and to really bring out their brilliance. There are times when he did this easily, and there were times when he drove people nuts with his approach which could be perceived as INTENSE. Jobs also had a keen sense of understanding of design and how to easily improve things in simple yet elegant ways by making changes or modifications to an existing design to make it work better. Steve Jobs - Visionary, Marketer, Spokesperson, DemoGenius, Inspiration, and much more. Yes Steve Jobs was integral to Apple & its success. Could Apple have existed without Steve Jobs? Yes. Existed. When he was alive, it soared due to his energy and the excitement around him. Now, it\u2019s pretty much existing and still riding his coattails as true innovation from the company has been non-existent since October 5, 2011. Sadly. Of course all of this is my perception of the person and friend known as Steve Jobs that I knew for 24 years. Peace ",

            "answer_text": "Apple has just become the first US company to reach $2 trillion in value.  What's amazing is that Apple grew despite that the global economy shrank faster than ever before in the COVID 19 pandemic. But this road was full of thorns and fire. One of the greatest technology companies of all time was once on the verge of being bankrupt. In 1997, Steve Jobs was brought back to revive the Apple. To pull out of danger of bankruptcy, Jobs made a deal with Microsoft (their biggest rival at the time) which bought non-voting shares worth $150M in Apple. They promised not to sell their stake for the next 3 years. The tough decision Jobs had to make was heavily criticized. Many believed that for Apple to win, Microsoft had to lose. But it was the other way around. That investment bailed out Apple from the financial crisis during that time. It recovered, focused on product innovation and never looked back. Since then it became the first company to hit $1 trillion market cap. Now it passed $2 trillion and now is $400 billion more valuable than Microsoft. In the 23 years since that August day, Apple has skyrocketed, in terms of shareholder value, cultural cachet, technological importance, and brand equity. This is what Steve Jobs has done for the Apple.  Competition lifts you to the next level. Competition is the most magnificent thing in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. ",
