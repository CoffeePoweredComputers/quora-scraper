            "answer_text": "How intelligent is Bob Dylan? Stupid enough to write a song called \u2018Masters of War\u2019 in which this great scholar and moral intellectual with no teeth nor gums denounces: \u201cCome, you masters of war You that build the big guns You that build the death planes You that build all the bombs\u2026\u201d BLAH BLAH BLAH \u201cAnd I hope that you dieAnd your death'll come soonI will follow your casketIn the pale afternoonAnd I'll watch while you're loweredDown to your deathbedAnd I'll stand over your grave'Til I'm sure that you're dead\u201d BLAH BLAH BLAH! Then promptly accepts the Blood Money for a Nobel Prize (dependent upon writing some essay drivel for the prize money) from that arch Master of War, Alfred Nobel whose dynamite and munitions blew the heads off of the shoulders and the arms of off the torsos of men in the Crimean War. Later, Nobel acquired Bofors, the Swedish armaments company best known for its quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. Nobel bore a burden of guilt to the grave, not only for having made war a more terrible business but also for a nitroglycerine experiment which went wrong, killing a number of workers at his laboratory. Among the dead was his brother Emil. HYPOCRITE DYLAN. To the wrath of the Gods with the little piece of shit. Here is a little ditty on Dylan and his cohort Cohen for your amusement: Zimmerframe on a Wire Ol\u2019 Zimmerframe is writin on an on Lucky to get on an album one good song Tells his lies an has us all believe Was a lonesome hobo of no reprieve, Born of comfy merchant hard-ware store The boy was never in want for more Tells the world he hitch-hiked a train To new york, new york to find a ballad strain But truth will out and truth will tell That mummy and daddy carried him by the hand To new york, new york so he could make his stand, Whilst on the topic of an halitosis midget Lets turn to cohen, who was want to fidget \u2018bout the Chinese translation of \u2018beautiful losers\u2019 - A piece of trivia for college-kid tossers For to proffer such weak juvenilia dribblings An\u2019 all his other banal scribblings To the Great Culture \u2013 across the Great Divide To the Unknown Wisdom of The other Side To the land of Confucius, Lao Tzu and more This little man cohen said he felt so sore Only able to offer trivia, and nothing more! \u00a9 2020 Lawrence Goethe ~ Mystic Genius & Conquistador of The Immoralists ~ ",

            "answer_text": "The average Ashkenazi Jew has an IQ of 115. But Dylan is a genius so lets add 30 points:145. That seems a reasonable guess to me. However, IQ is only interesting to people who haven\u2019t really achieved anything yet. It is a way to estimate how much someone could achieve. Dylan managed to achieve a lot, so IQ is not important. It is like saying to Lionel Messi: \u2018We have tested your football talent and you are average.\u2019 If you want to get an impression of how intelligent Dylan is, check old interviews on YouTube. He has to answer questions from much older journalists, who obviously think, \u2018Should I be impressed by this scruffy looking 21 years old punk?\u2019 However, as soon as he starts answering he murders them. They turn into newspaper clerks. Lennon and Jagger had the same quality. You can only play around with professional journalists like that, if you have the natural confidence of a highly intelligent person. ",
