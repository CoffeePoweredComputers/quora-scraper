            "answer_text": "They are all like that when it comes to the more mainstream stuff. While I'm sure that they could have some good non-overly-optimistic Pop, that might not be quite as easy to find especially for those not from China. Though like some people below me have said it is possible that China could possibly have some other variations from the bland, standard Pop fare.  It's like that with JPop and even KPop. It's not so much that it is cheesy but that it is like super cheerful and optimistic and all-around very dance electronica based. There is nothing that can be done about it. The industry in Japan, South Korea, and or China is entitled to release this type of music if they want.  I recommend listening to JRock. Right now, that is one of the most exciting music genres around, even worldwide I would say. I mean inside I will always love music from various countries and genres but for ground-breaking stuff JRock is the place to be.  I recommend if you're willing: TK from Ling Tosite SigureJinnLing Tosite SigureBuck-TickFear, and Loathing in Las Vegas ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, music often reflect sentiment and romance , also ballads.  In recent history , much of the music in the West, predominantly in the Anglophile world -- where in the sixties, to have used acid or hallucinogenic drugs was one of the creation of music that had broken the traditional music making .. no ?  I think in many ways, the Chinese or any other nations who can foster music without the influence of drugs is a good thing -- I am still enjoying the many classical musics before the entry of the \"drug induced\" creativities.

            "answer_text": "Actually there many talented composers and singers in China like Luo Dayou, Li Zongsheng and of course Jay Chou. I think if you understand Chinese better, you would start to appreciate the beauty of their songs. Meanwhile, there's a rock band called Beyond, which is my favorite. But their songs are written almost in Cantonese. You can listen to their song Dadi( great earth) first. Nowadays Chinese young people really have a bad taste for music. Sad. For me, a good song must have good lyrics that are not cheesy. ",
