            "answer_text": "I started to write about this, but I\u2019m tempted to say it\u2019s complicated. When you watch a film, the end credits will have a list of the songs used in the film. This list includes the singer, the author/s and the licensees. I\u2019m really annoyed that I have to see who the caterer was before I get to this bit. (I\u2019m even more annoyed at TV because they don\u2019t even do this and squeeze the credits onto half the screen to tell you about the next programme.)The point about this example is that copyright is a bit misleading as there are all kind of rights bundled up in music whose owners get paid. Often, these rights belong to someone who did not write the song. I\u2019ve written about this elsewhere. Everything about the music is owned by these people. You can\u2019t use the lyrics, the melody, even part of the melody, even the \u201ctimbre\u201d it would appear. At least, not without permission and usually involving the exchange of money. And by the way, the copyright protection in Europe is different from America the last time I looked, although that might have changed by now. I knew a musician who claimed that he had left his tape in a record studio over the weekend. A Brit band then put out it\u2019s enormously popular first album, based he said, on songs on his tape. Could he prove it, NO. He died later from alcoholism, though he did have problems before. The moral is, if you make music which you want to distribute, make sure there is some record of your work. ",

            "answer_text": "No specific action of registering a music is mandatory for protection of original music- then how is it protected from infringement? By default any music composed by a person is covered under the copy rights act so no specific act is required. In that case if more than one person is claiming rights over the same music who gets to own it and who gets to be punished for infringement? Unless proved otherwise before the court of law or other judicial and quasi judicial authority each of the claimants enjoy protection from the charges of infringement - but the person who publishes his music which is original has always an edge and would be come the plausible theory for the courts to place its good opinion in. So is it not required to register your music for protecting under copy right laws? It would be required to register in foreign countries to prevent infringement in the such country and for enforcement in other countries one must specifically register their artistic work. ",
