            "answer_text": "You have to be of Asian descent. Preferably Korean, Chinese or Thai.You have to be be good looking. Looks are everything in the Kpop industry.Apart from looks, you have to be good at singing and dancing .Lastly- If you were born in Korea, you would already know that you need to audition to get into a good production house, then train for years before you debut. Getting into a production house is the first step. If you are from overseas, you're gonna have a hard time. Try catching the eye of the production houses in Korea. Upload videos on YouTube showing off your dance, bring your talent to the spotlight. Search for Kpop competitions or auditions. It's gonna be hard and you'll need lots of luck. Good luck. [I don't know if it's a proper answer but I tried my best answering to what I know. Do your own research as well. ] ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, I'm assuming you're not from korea. Online audiotns are always open 24/7 for almost all companies plus if you're from some specific country, some agencies have worldwide auditions. If you get through, some companies pay for your trip to Korea for a second round of open audition. It also depends on the position you're auditioning for. Usually there are three rounds plus the online auditions . And the end it's usually a sing off or dance off or rap battle. And the winner is scouted and well, becomes a trainee. Looks play a major role, the agencies prefer east Asian looking people over foreigners. And particularly these days talent is a must have. You must be so good that can catch the eyes of the agencies. Unless you're really food they probably would prefer if you were of Korean decent or living in Korea cause there are many problems for a foreigner with the country and change in the Visa or citizenship. And lastly, do you really want it? It's basically risking your life. But then again, if you're not ready to risk it all, you can't get it right? ",

            "answer_text": "It's a pretty difficult job. First of all you have to go through auditions of the agencies, most of them keep global auditions these days,so you just have to keep the track of dates and places. Once you get selected ,these agencies will call you to Korea and you might have to go through another round of auditions there. If they really find potential,you will be given a contract to train under this agency,that you have gotten into, for some specific time. Signing a contract does not necessarily ensure debuting. If you are really talented and lucky enough, you will get a chance to debut under the agency. The training session involves continuous evaluation and might also force you to get into some survival show. After years of rigorous training, you might be finally able to succeed. Hope this info helps :-) ",
