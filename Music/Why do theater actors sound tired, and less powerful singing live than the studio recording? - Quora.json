            "answer_text": "The obvious answer is that when they sing live, they\u2019re having to do all the acting and choreography around the singing. In the studio recording, they just have to focus on getting the song sounding just right, plus they\u2019ve got post-production people to help as well. When they\u2019re singing live, it\u2019s just them and what they can do in the moment. And if the song comes during/after a particularly emotional scene or with a huge and/or particularly demanding dance-break, it will take a toll on how strong their voice is, no matter how physically fit they are or how much vocal training they\u2019ve had. In the Original London Cast Recording of Billy Elliot, for example, the boy singing Billy\u2019s part in \u201cElectricity\u201d sounds just as energetic at the end of the song as he does at the start, whereas if you\u2019ve ever seen the show live, you know that whoever is playing Billy sounds absolutely exhausted by the end of the song. The difference? The boy didn\u2019t have to dance a very demanding and long dance in the middle when he was singing the song in a studio. On stage, whoever is playing Billy has to go from singing, to dancing a three minute non-stop challenging dance, and back to singing, and all this after having already been onstage for almost two and a half hours singing and dancing for a majority of that. And this is demanded of a boy of around 10\u201313 years old. And then you get into things like the natural acoustics of the theatre vs having the singing perfectly produced and directly fed into your ear and all the more technical aspects like that which I\u2019m not really qualified to significantly expand on. In all honesty though, there are only a handful of performers I can think of who consistently sound truly noticeably different when singing live vs on a studio recording. ",

            "answer_text": "Says who? I find it amusing that so many questions pretend the subjective opinion to be a fact. In this very case: \u201cTheater actors sound tired and less powerful than studio recordings.\u201d I think this is complete and utter nonsense. There are recordings of many, many, many live performances that outshine the studio recording. Will stage actors have a good and a bad day? Sure! But to generalize all live performances are weaker than studio recordings is nonsense. ",
