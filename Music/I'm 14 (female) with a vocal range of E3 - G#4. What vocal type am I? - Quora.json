            "answer_text": "Based on that range, you seem like a contralto. But to find your actual type, you need to look at other things, as well, like the range you sound best at, your dynamics, your tone, etc. Furthermore, you are 14, so you are still developing your voice. If you are training as a vocalist, be sure that your voice is going to change. ",
