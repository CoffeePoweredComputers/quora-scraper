            "answer_text": "Hi, I am no expert but will share my views on your question. I love Blues and Rock having listened to it for some 40 year now, since I was 13 and old enough to understand both genres. Firstly, The Blues it is said came out of the cotton fields of the American deep south. Mostly poor black families and other poor families did the hard work, for little pay or food but was a way to sustain themselves. To overcome the hardship when working people sang songs some mixed with spiritual promises of everlasting life, salvation and hope for better things. Flowing from this was the natural day to day stories of love, woe and heartbreak. The use of musical instruments such as the acoustic guitar helped carry these songs and allowed the players to invent playing styles such as riffs, melodies and tuning the guitar down to play it differently so as to add something else to the music. Slides were used to promote a mournful or uplifting accompaniment to the songs sang. An obvious borrowing of this was by Hawaiian artists and the introduction of electrified musical instruments like lap steels and guitars. The Great Depression of 1929 and through the 1930\u2019s saw tens of thousands of African American families travel to industrial cities to find work such as Chicago. Bringing with them their musical abilities record labels recorded artists and provided a source of income. Descendants of these people carried on the tradition adding new elements to blues music, putting a back beat to the sound and incorporation of instruments, this new style they called, Rhythm and Blues. Jumpin' Joe Turner was among the greatest of Rhythm and Blues artists with his catchy tunes, piano blues boogie style. Some his hits caught the attention of record labels who saw huge profits from record sales and live touring and became a favourite song style by many young white, up and coming artists. A young 18 year Memphis man named Elvis Aaron Presley did a tryout session for Sun Records, which resulted in no promise of great things, during a break, Elvis messing around with fellow part-Cherokee bassist, Bill Black and guitarist, Scotty Moore saw them perform at Elvis' request an upbeat version of a fellow Memphis Blues artist number called \u201cThat's alright little mama\u201d. In the sound booth, Sam Phillips, the owner, producer heard this promptu sound they were making and immediately saw a hit on his hands, so he asked them to cover it a few more times so he could record it!  So a Blues song can be attributed to the world being introduced Elvis Aaron Presley! As to the question of \u201cwhat is the difference between the Blues and Rock?\u201d My answer would be \u201cNothing at all\u201d because Blues is the grandfather of Rock! As each decade came along, changes were made, but in essence to cry of hope, love, heartbreak and pain is captured in both genres. I probably need to add that different styles of music borrowed from each other. Jamaican youths who fell foul of the law in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s were sent to Reform Schools where part of the curriculum including music lessons, mostly horned instruments and drums borrowed from the British Military parades when Jamaica was governed by Great Britain. Many young talented players of saxophone, trumpet, coronet etc fused their knowledge of music with local Jamaican styles. When the portable transistor radio was invented, it found great popularity in Jamaica. Miami blues, rhythm and blues artists could be heard inspiring another genre of music, from this came elements of Jamaican Mento music, Ska (from artists such as Jamaican jazz guitarist Ernest Ranglan) SKA, a fast-paced beat throughout the 1950\u2019s and later slowed down to accommodate lovers who wanted to dance while holding each other and nicknamed (Rock Steady) which again fused into Reggae, a sound widely recognised around the world. One other related style was the use of dubbing popular songs changing its beat, adding echoes and giving commentary during the song or raps. This was picked up by American artists such as some of the first rap groups from the late 1970\u2019s like Kim Tim III - The Fatback Band; Rapping and Rocking the house- Funky 4 plus 1 and SuperRappin' by Grandmaster Flash and the Fabulous Five.

            "answer_text": "My interpretation, which I have come to after several years of playing the blues, is that blues has an ambiguity between major and minor which rock lacks. Blues is essentially major and minor at the same time. You can play either the major third or the minor third, which is the switch note for chords, or even both at the same time. The quintessential blues chord is the dominant seventh chord, which has a major third and a minor seventh. Another popular bluesy chord is the so-called Hendrix chord, often called the dominant seventh sharp ninth. It contains a major third, a minor seventh, and a minor third one octave up (the sharp ninth is a sharp second one octave up, and the same note as the flat tenth, which is the minor third an octave up). Early rock and roll took blues chord progressions like the 12-bar, dropped this major-minor ambiguity, and just played in major for the most part. Heavy rock reinvented it in a way with the power chord, which is just the first and fifth - no third, so neither major nor minor. So blues is major and minor simultaneously, rock and roll is one at a time, and rock is neither major nor minor unless it wants to be. ",
