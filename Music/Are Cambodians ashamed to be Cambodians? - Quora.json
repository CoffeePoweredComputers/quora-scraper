See below the amazing film about the story of King Suryavarman II if you have never been taught:  For example many cambodians have Chinese ancestors, my mother\u2019s grandmother was even a noble Chinese but my mother will rarely say she has chinese blood, she considers she is 100% khmer (cambodian). I\u2019m myself Khmer but have been mostly leaved in France as French, I don\u2019t even speak my mother\u2019s tongue any more, but I\u2019m rather proud of being Khmer and I\u2019m now relearning my native language. Having talked to some Khmer people occasionally, there seem to be rather a shame by older people that some young generations are losing Khmer spirit for the American\u2019s one: love for Money, lack of morality and respect,\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I clearly can\u2019t answer for Khmer people and I hope someone from Cambodia will, but I wonder why would you think that. While Cambodia is a developing country with drastic inequalities, Khmers created one of the greatest empires in history with the largest city in the world (until industrial revolution). In modern times, they survived one of the worst genocides in history during the Khmer Rouge regime, proving extreme resilience. That\u2019s pretty damn impressive to me. ",
