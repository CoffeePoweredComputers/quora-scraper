            "answer_text": "Depends who you are, I suppose. If you\u2019re a Christian, in a way, I suppose. God supposedly imbued humans with free will and creativity so everything we create could be attributed to God. However, I would say that music \u2018comes from God\u2019 the same way heinous acts of evil committed by humans \u2018comes from God\u2019. Humans have the capacity to be many things and creating music, like any thing we do or create, good or bad, is just a byproduct of that. (I suppose this is why pro athletes also often thank God for their talent and when they make excellent plays, as if their athletic performance is a gift from God.) If you\u2019re a non-Christian, your religion probably has their own explanation of where music comes from. Perhaps music comes from a specific deity who represents music or perhaps it\u2019s governed by a general all-purpose deity like God also. If you\u2019re an atheist, then, of course, the idea that an imaginary person who lives in the sky is putting music in your head is probably ludicrous, if not offensive to musicians. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing comes from God. People are smart and have wonderful talents - like writing music. Some wrote great music for the church because they believed in some god or another. Most of them are dead now and lived in times when god and religion was the only hope for many people. They lived shitty, short lives - the promise of eternity in the afterlife must have been something to aspire to if the odds of you dying of some nasty, virulent disease before you reach 30 - or earlier. In modern days most people write/make music to make money and become famous - and because they are good at it and enjoy doing what they do. Some may be religious: I don\u2019t know what the proportion is but I am guessing that a lot aren\u2019t (unless they are country music musicians!) Does god have anything to do with all this music? No\u2026most of the time it\u2019s a mortal being slogging away - failing a lot and maybe hitting the jackpot of fame. As you religious bunch keep saying - god gave people free will. If he exists, he\u2019s probably too busy torturing someone who didn\u2019t worship him enough to worry about some kid trying to play an 8 bar blues tune. ",
