            "answer_text": "If you want recordings, you will have a hard time finding things. Performers hold copyright on their performances for 70 years, if I recall, and can renew it for longer. So you would have to look for less well known music from 1940 and before. If you want to perform it yourself, you are in better luck. Composers have copyright for the same length of time, but we have much older scores than records. The classical canon \u2014 Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and their contemporaries\u2014 should be available for performance without copyright (but someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong!). There might be some newer compositions, ie Brahms or Stravinsky, that are out of copyright, but check before using them. ",
