            "answer_text": "I'm not sure but \u201cNirvana\u201d is pretty good. Besides the famous one there was a band called \u201cNirvana\u201d in 1967. There was a band called \u201cBread\u201d as well which sounds boring but it kind of stands out because of how mundane it is. It's like naming a band shoe or hat. But seriously other great names are \u201cUFO\u201d, \u201cSpectrum\u201d, \u201cJefferson Airplane\u201d (as \u201cmembers\u201d left it changed its name to \u201cJefferson Starship\u201d then \u201cStarship\u201d). INXS was a pretty good name. ELO which was short for Electric Light Orchestra. The Doors sounds mundane until you realist its from a William Blake quote or poem that said (to paraphrase): if the walls of perception were cleansed all things would appear as they are.. Infinite. Steppenwolf was another great one and T-Rex as well. Pink Floyd was named by Syd Barrett after two Blues artists Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. AC/DC was an appriate name for such a loud band. U2 is a good name. Heaps of people probably don't even know that a U2 was a type of plane. In fact in Billy Joel's \u201cWe didn't start the fire\u201d he mentions \u201cU-2\u201d amongst events that happened in the 1950s that initially confused me because U2 came onto the scene in the late 70s/1980. I didn't learn until later about the USs \u201cU-2 spy plane\u201d that was shot down over the Soviet Union in the 1950s (edit: it happened on the 1st of May 1960 during Eisenhower\u2019s Presidency.) The pilot was captured by The Soviet Union and it was a big international incident. But I digress. I'll no doubt think of heaps after this but there's some good ones I can think of. ",

            "answer_text": "well, as i am part of an amazing fanbase called A.R.M.Y I must say the best band i have ever heard of is a K-Pop (korean pop) group called BTS! Otherwise known as Bangtan Sonyeondan, BTS is a 7-member korean boy band who\u2019s name translates to \u201cBulletproof Boy Scouts\u201d or more known as \u201cBeyond The Scene\u201d. Now let me introduce you to the members (youngest to oldest) 1.Jeon Jung-Guk (Jungkook) singer, dance line currently 21 yrs old (september 1, 1997) 5\u203210\u2033 2.Kim Tae-Hyung (V) singer 23 years (December 30, 1995) 5\u203210\u2033 3.Park Ji-Min (Jimin) singer, dance line 23 years (October 13, 1995) 5\u2032 8\u2033 4. Jung Ho-Seok (J-Hope) rapper, dance line 24 years (February 18, 1994) 5\u2032 10\u2033 5.Min Yoon-Gi (Suga) rapper 25 years (March 9, 1993) 5\u2032 9\u2033 6.Kim Nam-Joon (RM) rapper 24 years (September 12, 1994) 5\u2032 11\u2033 7.Kim Seok-Jin (Jin) singer 26 years (December 4, 1992) 5\u2032 10\u2033 each member has a unique and fun personality. they have many many many songs and have been making music since their debut date of June 7, 2013. To be honest, BTS has helped me through a lot of my life. Whenever I\u2019M sad i can always watch a Bangtan-Bomb (It\u2019s like Vine or short funny videos, but with BTS) of bts music videos, or just think about them and it makes me happy. they\u2019ve taught me to be happy with who i am, but all in all, i think BTS is the best group in the world. Infact, they\u2019re more than a group, they are legends. You nice, keep going -jimin ",
