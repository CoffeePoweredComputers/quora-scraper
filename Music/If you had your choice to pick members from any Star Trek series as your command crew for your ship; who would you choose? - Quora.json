            "answer_text": "A lot depends on which era you're wanting, since there's no real \"Comm\" officer in the Next Gen and beyond series. It's also difficult to keep to only canonical TV/film examples, since there are excellent candidates in the various novels. But, just keeping to the basics: Captain: I'd have to choose Ben Sisko. Sorry, folks, but the dude almost single-handedly prevented a trillion-death war with the Dominion. He made a few tough, unethical choices, but in the end the results mattered. Kirk broke a lot of rules, and Picard is a superb diplomat, but Sisko matured into a phenomenal commanding officer. Backup would be Mackenzie Calhoun from the Peter David New Frontier series - the only guy who ever beat the Kobayashi Maru scenario WITHOUT cheating. First Officer: It would have to be Spock or T'Pol. You need to have an objective, dispassionate viewpoint, but still able to follow the chain of command. T'Pol, aside from when she disagrees with something because the Vulcan Science Academy doesn't believe it exists, she's an excellent foil for a Captain. Both she and Spock have enough tactical knowledge and diplomatic skills to fill in if the Captain is incapacitated. Conn/Nav: Sulu, possibly Travis Mayweather as a backup. They fly the ship superbly well, and are good hand-to-hand combatants as well. Ops/Science: Data, followed by Seven of Nine as a backup. She has the knowledge of hundreds of species at her command, as well as advanced skill sets given her cybernetic implants. Data has shown himself to be superb at Command when necessary, so he's got that down, and they both serve as the \"immune to most forms of humanoid disabling attacks\" Communications (if applicable): Uhura, followed by Flaherty, the briefly-mentioned officer who would have become Riker's Number One if he'd taken the command of the Aries in \"The Icarus Factor\". Knowledge of multiple languages as well as cryptography (I think Uhura was commended at being superb with this skill) is a must for this role. Tactical/Security Chief: Worf at the DS9 era is a bit more seasoned and skilled, but I'd also nominate Malcolm Reed, who had to deal with the same problems with more limited technologies of the earlier Enterprise era. Reed has a long military history and both he and Worf would serve in the role well. A possible backup would have to be Elim Garak, as I feel there must be that one officer you send in when no one else can afford to get their hands dirty. Think of him as the Section 31 guy who isn't really a part of that group. His expertise at cryptography, tactics, hand-to-hand combat and espionage are invaluable. I preface this by saying I don't believe the idyllic utopia of TNG is in any way realistic for the future and made for poor drama in many episodes; there was, is and always will be a Section 31 type black ops group in any large governmental body, because those deeds sometimes have to be done. Chief Engineer: Scotty, hands down. La Forge is good but he has a serious problem with coolant leaks and warp core breaches. Trip Tucker is handy but he has an attitude that just rubs me wrong. Scotty is the MacGyver of Star Trek and could repair a warp core with a roll of duct tape, a paper clip and a diamond from a wedding ring if it came to that. Chief Medical Officer: I know a lot of people like the Doctor, but I dislike any situation where my CMO can be disabled by a photon scattering device or a lucky shot to take out a mobile emitter. Phlox is my hands-down choice, mainly because he has multiple degrees in humanoid and veterinary medicine, and takes advantage of more biological treatment methods than just a hypospray. Plus his species is naturally resistant to Borg nanoprobes. ",

            "answer_text": "Well let's see\u2026 CAPTAIN \u2014 This one depends. If the ship is going to fight much I'd want Sisko. But if I'm expecting surveys and diplomatic missions and deep space exploration it'll be Picard. Though Archer is the runner up as he combines a true explorers spirit like Picards with a warrior streak like Sisko, without being quite as good at either as those captains(and he lacked Picards diplomatic talents). But he was exceptionally good at keeping his crew alive while outclassed and outgunned at every turn. FIRST OFFICER \u2014 Riker, easily. Spock was a good science officer, but rarely shined as XO. Chakotay did a decent job but was Riker lite basically. T'Pol was much like Spock but had better command instincts. And while I like Kira as a character, as an XO her role never really came into focus. Riker on the other hand was a textbook XO. He managed personnel, allocated ship resources, dealt with problems and generally kept the dog off Picards lawn. CHIEF ENGINEER \u2014 Charles Tucker III. Now I know he has the most outdated knowledge base to work with, but he also combines the best aspects of the other engineers. He' a miracle worker like Scotty as evidenced by his super fast warp core restart, but I don't have to worry he isn't doing his level best because my ship isnt \u201chis\u201d enterprise. He thinks outside the box like Torres and works hard and gets his hands dirty like O'Brien. And he has LaForges habit of tweaking engines outside of spec so they run better. Plus he is one of the most loyal characters on trek and did very well when he was in command so he's also my 3rd officer(makes sense being he is a commander). He can catch up with tech manuals. CHIEF OF OPERATIONS \u2014 Data. Bit of a cheat since Data was really the science officer. Clearly the COO position was so he could wear gold. O'Brien was COO too but clearly the engineer, as was Kim who operated the transporter from the bridge and said what sensor readings were from time to time(everything Kim did was a footnote in Worfs job). Still the position let' me put an android on the bridge and as 3rd officer. SCIENCE OFFICER \u2014 7 of 9. Dax is the runner up with those 8 lives of experience, but all those Borg implants and knowledge and the ability to walk through forcefields is too good to pass up. TACTICAL \u2014 Worf. Especially as ds9 shows, none of the other competitors come close to coordinating and getting the most out of large weapons grids. If my ship goes into battle I want him firing the weapons. SECURITY \u2014 Another little cheat splitting it from tactical, but Odo is too valuable an asset with his shape shifting ability. Also he's proven time and again how effective he is at the job. CMO\u2014 Julian Bashir. This one is a matter of versatility. The EMH has the most medical knowledge and being a hologram has cons and pros. Phlox was hood and his unorthodox treatments usually worked. McCoy is out of the running because he is by far the least capable. He needed alien help to reattach a brain to a spinal cord, yet Crusher was able(albeit barely) to do the same with her own knowledge, and Bashir replaced half of Bariels brain with a positronic processor. But aside from being a skilled doctor he is the only one who really proved useful beyond his role as a doctor. His genetically engineered brain and reflexes are useful in any number of situations. HELMSMAN \u2014 Riker and Paris are really the 2 standout pilots, and Riker is already my XO. Mayweather and Sulu never really did anything that awesome, and a bunch of people flew the defiant on ds9. Nog was a great pilot during the war, Sisko did some very impressive maneuvering in the mirror universe, and Dax spent a lot of time at the helm and in command. I' tempted to pick Paris as he is more of a pure pilot than the others, but I'm going for Dax. I missed out on her centuries of experience by picking 7 of 9 but this way I get both. Dax did some top notch piloting during operation return and one of her past hosts was a skilled test pilot. But she also flew the defiant when the computer stabilization was down, which is no small feat. The key here is versatility. Bashir, 7 of 9, Dax, and Data are all highly versatile and intelligent crew members who bring a ridiculously huge knowledge base and a whole lot of brain power to the table. All of them save Bashir, 7, and Odo have proven command ability. And Odo and 7 of 9 bring some invaluable special abilities to the table. ",
