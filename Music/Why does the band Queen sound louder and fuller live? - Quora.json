            "answer_text": "Queen were always about playing live it's what they enjoyed most about everything and rightly so, it's ok making records but that means nobody gets to see you play your instrument nobody gets to see perform your craft\u2026. They sound louder live because, they're not playing through head phones or a bluetooth speaker!! There playing through a mult I speaker PA system!! And in places as big as football stadiums, you have to fill that place with sound without it bouncing back and getting horrible feed back!! They sound just as full on record as they do live, something will always sound better if you can see the string being hit, the words being said, it always does!! They have a great sound live! Its that simple, brian especially!! ",

            "answer_text": "According to Peter Hince, their roadie, they WERE incredibly loud. Hince was once the roadie for Mott the Hoople. He was asked to join Queen, and he did. He\u2019s the guy that you see handing Freddie his mic when you watch the concerts on youtube. Anyway, Hince said that Queen was the loudest band he had ever heard. He indicated that it was Brian May who loved it loud, and everyone had up to \u201c\u201cup their volume\u201d just to meet Brian\u2019s. That included Freddie and his voice. The meetings after the show usually included comments about the show not being loud enough! Hince has a first run of the Bohemina Rhapsody 45. He jokingly said he will have to sell it (I think he said it was worth around 3500 dollars) to get some really good hearing aids. The source for this is Queen Unseen by Peter Hince. It\u2019s a wonderful read to the inner workings and day to day of Queen on tour.. ",
