            "answer_text": "There are a few that I can think of: NCT Jisung  Many people say that Chenle behaves more like a stereotypical maknae (cute, affectionate, energetic), while Jisung is a lot quieter and doesn\u2019t do as much aegyo or really act too much like the maknae stereotype. However, he does seem to be very sweet and innocent, so while his maknae behaviors don\u2019t always fit the \u201cstandard\u201d he has a few things that do match up with how a maknae \u201cshould\u201d behave, however, there are fewer of these behaviors compared to the regular, energetic, cutesy maknae behaviors that have become the \u201cstandard.\u201d Super Junior Kyuhyun  He\u2019s really savage and cool and has never really seemed to behave like he was the maknae. Of course, he\u2019s respectful to his older members, but he\u2019s also very confident and blunt towards people, while the stereotypical maknae is often shy/sweet and very affectionate. To be honest, Suju as a whole is very unconventional and chaotic, so Kyuhyun being the stereotypical maknae is pretty unlikely to begin with (plus, he\u2019s from an older group, and maknae stereotypes seem to come more from 3rd/4th generation groups than senior ones). Donghae behaves more like the maknae (in nearly every aspect)-his innocence/occasional naivete, his cute behavior (although he does hate aegyo). Monsta X I.M.  He really seems really chill and independent. He doesn\u2019t seem to \u2018need\u2019 his older members for anything is is very tough, savage, and sometimes acts likes he tired of everyone lol. He just seems very mature and independent from his older members (I\u2019m not really sure why-if anyone knows, please feel free to comment and let me know), and it\u2019s very interesting. He respects them, but he doesn\u2019t seem to rely on them for too much (at least from what I know/have seen). I don\u2019t know too much about MX (still in the process of stanning), but Minhyuk gives me fake maknae vibes (because of his energetic, cuter behavior). Thanks to Dori Kay in the comments, she let me know that Jooheon is more of a fake maknae. I saw the video (it was cute af), and I\u2019ve seen his behavior in the past, and while Jooheon does hate aegyo, he\u2019s pretty energetic and happy (like a stereotypical maknae), and in the video even shows that his is a bit more dependent on his older members than I see with I.M. __ These are the only ones that I can really think of right now :) ",

While he might possess the typical attributes of a maknae (bubbly, cute, etc.) he\u2019s proven multiple times that he\u2019s not just these things. Something I\u2019ve noticed is that a lot of new Atiny tend to mistake San as the maknae.(quite understandable) He\u2019s pretty much everything you would expect a maknae to be. His energy is just so contagious and warm. For me personally it was hard to believe that he wasn\u2019t one of the youngest. Here\u2019s what differentiates Jongho from a standard maknae (to me): His voice (this guy has a voice of GOLD. it\u2019s so different from what i usually hear. it\u2019s not the kind of sound i think of when i think of the word, \u2018maknae\u2019)His overall vibe (Jongho seems like a calm and collected person. Something tells me he\u2019s great at expressing his opinions and is actually quite wise despite his age.)Just the way he carries himself is unique. There\u2019s a lot more to what you see/hear, and Jongho is a prime example of this. stan the 4th gen main vocal / ATEEZ! ~hazel ",

He knows what he wants and won't stop until he gets it. He can be quite cute when he needs to be(either on variety or to steal food from older members lmao) but he really is probably one of the most mature people I've ever seen. It's quite amazing. Seventeen's newest MV \u201cFear\" just came out along with their newest album \u201cOde To You\u201d. Please give it a watch and enjoy! ",

He also works out the most so him being the youngest and the fittest in his band is interesting. Just overall, he doesn\u2019t always act like the youngest unless he\u2019s like making others buy his food haha ",
