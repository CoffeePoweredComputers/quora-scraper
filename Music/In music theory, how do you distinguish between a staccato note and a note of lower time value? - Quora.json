            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t think of any reason in music theory why you would ever have to distinguish between a staccato quarter note and an eighth note followed by an eighth rest. While it is true that a staccato is a slightly different shape of note than simply a shorter note value, it doesn\u2019t always mean \u201chalf the value of the note it is on\u201d. Really, it means \u201cdetached\u201d. It has come to be performed approximately like an 1/8 note 1/8 rest when it is a staccato quarter, but a series of staccato eighths or sixteenths CANNOT be executed that way, except at the very slowest of tempos. In those cases, simply separating the notes with separate tongues (on a wind instrument) or the bow (on a string instrument) or with a bouncier touch (on piano) might be the only difference. Staccatos will be shaped differently according to the instrument and the style of the music. It is NOT simply a way of shortening notes; it is also a stylistic inflection. So there IS a reason to notate them differently, but it doesn\u2019t have to do with theory; it has to do with style. For legibility, I would generally prefer to reduce the number of rests in music I compose or arrange myself. It is usually easier to read consecutive staccato quarters than it is to read consecutive 8th-note-8th-rests, and the difference in execution is usually not enough to warrant the more complex notation. Your mileage may vary. ",

            "answer_text": "GOOD QUESTION! That most people get wrong. LOL Technically, staccato means disconnected as opposed to legato which means connected. There is no rule that says it\u2019s half the value. An 1/8 note followed by and 1/8 rest is a very specific duration of an equal value while a note played staccato would more likely be very short duration, even chopped off immediately. Guitarists are often in the habit of achieve staccato with a technique called palm muting but that isn\u2019t the only way it is achieved. It isn\u2019t unusual to have horn parts with practically every note having either a dash (legato) or dot (staccato) indication. There is some room for interptretation which is why conductors might feel inclined to sing it out more precisely what they want to hear from an entire section to agree. The bottom line is that for a band to be tight, it is just as important to be clear when the notes begin and when they end and it\u2019s important to distinguish the different indications. ",
