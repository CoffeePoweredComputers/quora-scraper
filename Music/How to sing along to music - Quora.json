            "answer_text": "Singing along with music is not as easy as it seems. If you are familliar to music theory and harmony, sometimes the top-line melody could sing the third, fifth or even 7th or 9th of the given chord progression. That means that you need to be aware of all the intervals take place in the song, in order not to get confused. But let\u2019s make our life easier here. First of all, you need to learn the top-line melody by heart. Find a keyboard and play down the melody. Then try to sing every note you hit. Try to identify the intervals, namely the distances between the keys you hit. If you get in a region where your voice starts to crack, use falzetto. Then, take the parts of the song one by one. First try to identify the intro from the verse and the chorus. Listen to the song by someone else. In which minute of the song do you hear his voice getting in? Then try to the instrumental part and sing what you\u2019ve learned. Always keep a record from yours efforts. That makes you better as you move on ",

            "answer_text": "What I do , if you want to sing it well, is listen to a part of the song, pause it then sing it to yourself until you\u2019re happy that it\u2019s in tune and you know the words. Then go on to the next part, pause it and sing the previous part and the part you just listened to until your\u2019e happy. Continue this for the rest of the song. Alternatively, sing along with the music on low volume, which means you will be able to hear your voice. When wanting to sing loudly, try to project your voice instead of trying to be louder, this will not only protect your voice, but will have a better quality. Unless you\u2019re going to be preforming in theatre it doesn\u2019t if you can\u2019t. Most importantly don\u2019t beat yourself up if you can\u2019t sing a certain song, it may not suit your voice, plus you can always adapt it to your own style. ",
