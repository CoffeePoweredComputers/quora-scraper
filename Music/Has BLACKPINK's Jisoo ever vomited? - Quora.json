            "answer_text": "I know a janitor that works in Blackpink's building. He has said that Jisoo has never vomited, but surprisingly she has never pooped as well. I guess the claims of her being an angel are completely true. The janitors say that Jisoo doesn't sleep much, they've seen her floating at night. Also, it seems as if they were implying that she doesn't have to eat or use makeup either. She lives a life of perfection. What makes you think she can vomit? That's disgusting! Jisoo can't do that!?
