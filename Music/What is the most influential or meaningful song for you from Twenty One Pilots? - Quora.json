            "answer_text": "Migraine and Car Radio are my top two because they perfectly summarize crippling depression. Car Radio is a metaphor for losing something that adds structure and normalcy to your life. The lyrics discuss having a car radio stolen, \u201cand now I just sit in silence\u201d. The narrator was using the buzz of music to drown out his depressing thoughts and to try to cover up how he was feeling. With the music playing, he didn't feel alone or like an outcast. Now that his radio is gone, he's forced to confront the taboo feelings that pop up. That's exactly what it feels like to be depressed and to be unable to stifle the bad thoughts because there's nothing you can use to distract yourself. Migraine is similar in that it talks about struggling to deal with depression. Depression is overwhelming: it takes over everything and infiltrates a person\u2019s ability to perform normal tasks. The narrator talks about how Sundays feel dismal to him (perhaps because he's going to have to start a whole new week the next day and it already feels impossible) and make him feel suicidal. Read the following lyrics: I am not as fine as I seem Pardon me for yelling and telling you green gardens Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead And how it is a door that holds back contents That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent Behind my eyelids are islands of violence My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find I did not know it was such a violent island Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win I begin to assemble what weapons I can find 'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind That\u2019s haunting. It hits almost a little too close to home, it's that scarily accurate. He's saying that while he pretends his mind is a beautiful lush garden, it's really a place of turmoil and bloody violence. He pretends to be doing well for everyone else\u2019s sake, but on the inside, he's severely hurting. He desperately thinks that maybe if he tries hard enough, he can fight those negative thoughts and drive them out so he can become well again. He believes that if he does not fight them, they will win and he will succumb, probably by committing suicide. Anyway, those are my top two TOP songs because I relate to strongly to them. I think they're brilliant. ",

It\u2019s about Tyler\u2019s doubts about God. in it, Tyler is desperately calling out to God to strike him down and destroy him, because at least that way, he\u2019d know God was realKitchen Sink- This is a song about finding your purpose in the world, but the part that get\u2019s me the most is in the chorus. Tyler says the words \u201cLeave me alone\u201d over and over again, but the last time he says \u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone\u201d, that hit me like a truckGuns for Hands- I interpret Guns for Hands as a song talking about suicidal tendencies and people\u2019s mental sufferingScreen- This is a song about hiding your true face, and lying about how you feelCar Radio- Car Radio was inspired by the time when Tyler\u2019s car radio was actually stolen, but he talks about over-thinking and how sitting alone with his thoughts.There are so many others, but these are the ones that impacted me the most ",
