            "answer_text": "Well, I think it\u2019s because the fans can\u2019t stop streaming. It\u2019s true that BTS might have more fans, but those fans are more dedicated to cheer BTS from face-to-face. By face-to-face, it means fan meeting, concert, event, and more. While Blink is the typical fan that watches their MV more than going to their idols event. Don\u2019t hate me yet. but I have proof. First is the North America ticket. YG says that the tickets are all sold out, but the truth is, there is still a bunch of tickets ready to be bought. The second point is, when blackpink is holding a mini fan meeting and was asked to sell 2400 tickets starting from 23rd of August 2019, they can\u2019t even sell out the ticket that has been running for a week. Oh gosh, A week! And it\u2019s only 2400 ticket! On the other hand, According to the resale site StubHub, BTS was one of the 2018 best selling tickets in the whole entire world. On October 9, BTS was said that they have sold about 2 million tickets for their album world tour. Their fan meeting tickets which are supposed to be around $50 until $80 was on the number $1300 for the online price. ",

            "answer_text": "The number of views doesn\u2019t determine one\u2019s popularity. Since YouTube deleted/froze 10 million+ views from Idol and Boy with Luv, it\u2019s hard to compare views. Blackpink is a relatively new group compared to BTS so they\u2019re a lot more hyped. Especially after Coachella, their views skyrocketed. Don\u2019t forget BP debuted with the YG silver spoon, under one of the Big Three. Big Hit was so tiny at the time that that has a contract with 1theK to promote their earlier videos. If you\u2019re going to compare, you have to do it with MVs that were released around the same time. For example, BP\u2019s Whistle which came out in August 2016 has around 370 million views. BTS\u2019s Blood Sweat & Tears, which came out in October 2016 has 450 million views. Theirs came out later AND has more views. Same with As if it\u2019s Your Last and DNA. AIIYL came out in June 2017 with 590 million views while DNA came out later in September 2017 with almost 800 million views. BTS actually has more views the majority of the time.
