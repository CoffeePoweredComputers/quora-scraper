            "answer_text": "Great question, and I think I have the perfect answer for this: Ladies and gents, I introduce to you the 80s rock (glam) band Warrant:  Honestly, they were pretty amazing. They had tons of hits, and as a guitarist, I really appreciated their guitarists\u2019 aggressive soloing style - they were technically proficient, delivering some of the coolest rock solos I\u2019d heard as a (very) young kid. The lyrics ranged from themes of lost love (Sometimes She Cries), excess (Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinkin Rich), and just plain being cool (Down Boys). This was normal for rock bands in the 80s, yet they seemed to be sort of a lost gem amongst a sea of sound alikes. As most bands do, they evolved into a much more complete sound and much more meaningful lyrics. When they recorded their second album Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, they were clearly turning into a more serious band, and not sounding as much as the fun party band they were initially known for. They have had a lot of commercial success in the past with rock ballads, and this newest album at the time explored more of that but also featured more stellar musicianship and lyrics dealing with murder, corruption, and even speculation that they were making social commentary on racism. When they went to turn in their completed album - Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (named after what the band wanted to be the first featured song) - the record company at the time agreed that they\u2019d release it on one condition: that they record one more song for the record that is light and upbeat, and more of a party song. You know how it goes in Hollywood: one for me (the artist), and one for them (the business). Lead singer Jani Lane (RIP) was somewhat insulted by this and wrote a song as a total joke. He went over the top with how silly the lyrics were, and purposely made it roughly three or so chords to make a point on how stupid these types of songs were, and how he and the band was no longer like that. It was a genius idea though, because he figured it\u2019d get tossed aside as filler while the rest of their album would speak for itself. Well, guess what. That song was Cherry Pie:  (If there\u2019s a slight possibility you aren\u2019t sure what song this is, search it on YouTube or Spotify etc and I will bet you\u2019ll recognize it almost instantly - especially if you were alive when it came out) This wasn\u2019t only their most popular song to date, but it was also what the record company decided to name the album. They also featured it as the lead single, against the band\u2019s wishes and promoted the hell out of it. To this day I still hear it at karaoke bars because of how ridiculously simple it is to sing, and pretty much everyone knows the words. Much to Lane\u2019s chagrin, he accidentally reverted them back into caricatures of themselves. They had no choice but to be the hair band monkeys their employers needed them to be. They eventually released a few other more serious songs as singles from the album, but the damage was done. Nirvava\u2019s Nevermind album came out several months after, which notoriously destroyed hair metal as a genre in one fell swoop - leaving Warrant in the dust as a joke - just another party band with a bunch of degenerate party animal sex-crazed glammed out specks of salt in the ocean which was the 80s. And the record company didn\u2019t care - they made millions off of the band and when that era came to a close, they signed only grunge bands to rinse and repeat their exploits. Cherry Pie was literally written as a joke Just so they\u2019d had a filler song to placate their record company, and it ended up being one of the most popular songs of its era, ultimately leading to their demise.  You can\u2019t make up this level of irony. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about \u201cjust filler\u201d but Queen\u2019s 2nd best selling single was not even being considered as a single release from their album \u201cThe Game\u201d. \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d was written by Queen\u2019s bass player John Deacon. (I believe Queen is still the only band to have all four members inducted into the Songwriter\u2019s Hall of Fame.) Freddie was the only other member of Queen who was enthusiastic about the song. Roger thought it was a big mistake to release it as a single but has since said that he was never so happy to be as wrong as one could be. \u201cJohn Deacon, being totally in his own world, came up with this thing, which was nothing like what we were doing. We were going for the big drum sound: you know, quite pompous in our usual way. And Deakey says, \"No, I want this to be totally different: it's going to be a very tight drum sound.\" It was originally done to a drum loop - this was before the days of drum machines. Roger did a loop, kind of under protest, because he didn't like the sound of the drums recorded that way. And then Deakey put this groove down. Immediately Freddie became violently enthusiastic and said, \"This is big! This is important! I'm going to spend a lot of time on this.\" It was the beginning of something quite big for us, because it was the first time that one of our records crossed over to the black community. We had no control over that; it just happened. Suddenly we were forced to put out this single because so many stations in New York were playing it. It changed that album from being a million-seller to being a three-million seller in a matter of three weeks or so. \u2014Brian May Interviews: Brian May: Guitar World Magazine '93 at the very bottom. Freddie\u2019s friend and fan Michael Jackson also deserves credit for the song\u2019s release and subsequent success. He helped convince Brian and Roger to release it telling them backstage that it would be a huge hit after hearing them perform it live in LA. The song won Favorite Pop/Rock Single at the American Music Awards in 1981 and Queen was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with a Vocal. ",
