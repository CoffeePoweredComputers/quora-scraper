            "answer_text": "The D minor arpeggio is the saddest of all. In the key of D minor (natural minor) there some sad and some happy. Of course equating minor with sad and major with happy is a somewhat shallow contrivance. Some very happy songs are in minor keys (Pharrel William\u2019s Happy) and some sad songs in major keys (Radiohead\u2019s Creep). ",
