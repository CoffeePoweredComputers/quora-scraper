            "answer_text": "I learned  a long time ago that you can only sing as well it as you think you do (most people who can hold a tune think they can sing reasonably well) There is always someone else out there better than you but learning to be gracious about it and enjoy the other person's voice is the key to everything. How do I know this? Some years ago, I was auditioning to be a background singer to a famous gospel artist. He was forming a unique choir and he only had slots for a few \"rafter shoutin'\" sopranos and a few \"sho nuff\" altos. The tenors were mostly filled unless you had an exceptional voice.My ex husband and I were both relatively trained singers having studied from a young age with both formal lessons and church instruction. We entered the church that was sponsoring the tryouts and noticed that it was full to the brim. Now there's something you might need to know here. My ex husband and I lived in Detroit at the time and  Detroit is noted for its musical talent and it is expressly noted for its gospel musical groups and roots. Aretha Franklin, The Clark Sisters, the Winans etc all came and lived in Detroit and these are just a few names. Needless to say, seeing packed house in Detroit for gospel tryouts  terrified me as my voice is not necessarily a gospel voice but more a trained lyric soprano voice. I slid up to a woman that looked friendly and said. \"Girl if any of these people are goina \"blow\"(sing exceptionally well) I'm goina pick up my coat and walk out of here!\"Smiling she turned around and replied, \"Girl I'm wit ya, you ain't lyin' ! There are too many people here and I know I don't have that kind of voice.\" I was glad to know that I wasn't the only one feeling the pressure and I was call to sing in front of everyone before she was. After I sang my solo with my eyes closed because of fear, I open my eyes and saw that the woman that I talked to was making a big to do about picking up a coat grabbing the friend she came with and walking out the door.She was telling me I could blow and I was shocked! As I was about to sit down she turned around and sat down next to me not saying a word. When she got up to sing and I was rewarded by hearing the voice of an alto angel I too got up dragging my husband (at the time) and I honestly wanting to forget the whole thing.She hurried back to her seat and motioned for me to come back as well which I reluctantly did.She reminded me then of something very simple and important. We weren't there to out do one another's singing, we were there to glorify God! End of story. BTW... all 4 of us made in the group. My X husband and I did not stay but for a few years. However the woman I talked with is still going strong with the group and the group has been around since 1993. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you sing good?  (Singing \u201cJesse's Girl\" cover with Spacehorse) My singing voice was okay. But my range is really impressive. I've got a good falsetto that dips hard into a very good baritone. Note that I said \u201cwas\u201d okay\u2026 Before I started sitting on my ass full time to make money, I was in great shape. My health conditioning is directly related to my singing ability. When I sing along in the car now, I'm appalled by how quickly my breath fails because I haven't worked out regularly in 2 years. When I was in good shape, my voice was pretty good. Okay bye. ",
