            "answer_text": "I have started composing very late in life. Why, or how? What is my process? My answer: I do not know. At least, I do not know how or why a new piece begins to exist in my mind. Much of my composing is done in my head, often while doing other things at the same time, often totally unrelated to music. If I sit at a desk and start composiing by the clock, the results are no different than composing mentally, whether in solitude or in a public place. Perhaps a word, a sound, a shape, or a face, or a color can trigger an eventual compoosition. Obviously there must be a catalyst of some kind, but I never can poinpoint it either before or after the fact. After the initial sowing of the seed, a long gestation period sets in. I am not saying the process is mindless in the full sense of the work\\d. It is,however, on automatic pilot. If it works at all, it does not seem to matter what the surroundings are. The music can be gestating for a long time without making me aware of it. When the time comes, I write it down. There is no clear signal that the musuic is ready. No clarion call. But to write it out is easy because it is ready to be written out. In a sense, the music is already there, somewhere. I know it is complete, but it has to be born. I have only a very dim idea of what it is, but I can write it now in full, in minutest detail. Once the writing is complete, the mental music, the \u201csilent\u201d music in my head disappears permanently. Only the written-out product remains. At that point only do I find out what its is really like. I wish I could say that the process of composing is an unearthly vision, a deep meditation, or an emotional or spiritual phenomenon. Alas, it is very prosaic, like eating a bag of potato chips. Unfortunately, there are no angels in attendance to help me eat the chips, or to write out my latest composition. I am ashamed to admit that the experience is very down to earth. But once I see the work in its completed form, everything changes. All hell breaks loose. I become emotional, elated,agitated, apprehensive - all the hallmarks of becoming the father of a new baby. There is a feeling of helplessness. There is a feeling of achievemnt. Total reversal ofmood and mode. Also, very difficult on people who happen to be around me, especially my family. To complicate matters further, I usually \u201cwork\u201d on more than one piece at a time. So the \u201cprocess\u201d, whatever it may be, is always at work. ",

            "answer_text": "I have two methods of composition: improvisation and collage. I use the computer for both. At the moment, my software of choice is Ableton Live, and I've also done a lot of stuff with Pro Tools and Reason. It's been a long time since I \"composed\" something on a piece of paper (except for music school assignments.)  I like to start with a rhythmic framework, a programmed beat or a sampled drum loop. Then I plug in an instrument -- guitar, harmonica, a MIDI keyboard, whatever -- and record some jamming. I listen back to what I recorded, looking for the parts that work best, and edit them down to a \"highlight reel.\" The composition emerges out of copying and pasting parts of the edited jam into a structure. This method never fails me, and it usually goes fast. Here are examples: Blues For Nofi (disquiet0066-nonofi) Harmonica Figure (disquiet0042-naivemelody) I'm a terrible keyboard player, so a lot of the time it's easier for me to work out ideas in MIDI by just drawing the notes in with the mouse. I try not to worry too hard about scales and chords when I do this; I just add and remove notes by trial and error until it sounds good. Here's a piece I did for a film scoring class using this method: Girl On A Bridge I also really enjoy creating new music from existing material by other people. Lately I've been recording other people improvising on their instruments and then editing their playing into a shape that appeals to me. And for many years, I've been making new music by sampling and remixing. Often the end results bears little resemblance to the source material. 1930s Synth and Upright Bass A Technique of Rapid Passage through Varied Ambiances (disquiet0048-libertederive) The collage method also applies if I'm writing a more conventional \"song\" rather than creating electronic music. In the past, when I've written jazz, rock or country tunes, they end up being stitched together from little fragments of other tunes that I like.  Improvisation and composition are really the same act; improvisation is just very fast composition. I've spent many years studying and playing improvisation-oriented music: jazz, funk, rock, country, hip-hop, etc. Being well-practiced as an improviser makes composition a heck of a lot easier. I recommend it. You mention in your question details that you wait for inspiration to strike you. I recommend not doing that. Make it a habit to write some music every day, whether you're in the mood or not. Writing music is a skill like any other -- you get better if you practice. The stuff you crank out every day doesn't have to be good, you just have to push it through to completion. It's helpful to have external pressures to motivate you. Several of the pieces I linked above were prompted by the Disquiet Junto, an online community I belong to. Every week, the group leader emails out an assignment, and you have a few days to complete it and post it on the web. I recommend joining. The Disquiet Junto Having a community of listeners is very important. You are the worst judge of your own material. The pieces that I like the best are not necessarily the ones other people respond to. Meanwhile, sometimes people go nuts for something I tossed off in an hour without really thinking about it. You never know. That's why you need to just keep making music and sharing it with anyone who will listen. Put up links to stuff you've written and let us check it out! ",

            "answer_text": "I compose iteratively. Naturally, I have to start with some idea, and I\u2019ve been known to take long walks in the park imagining how some music might go, or to rapidly dash off a sketch all at once when my inner ear is hearing particularly clearly. That is a very small percentage of the time I spend composing, however. Most of the time, it\u2019s painstaking revision after revision after revision. Even for a melodic theme, often I will fill many pages trying out different versions and permutations. A typical revision cycle goes something like this: Format the current draft on the computer so it has plenty of empty space in the parts that haven\u2019t been written yet, then print it out.Go to a coffee shop so I won\u2019t be distracted, and start marking up the draft in pencil. My rule is to start by writing down anything I\u2019ve already figured out, which could be anything from a melody or chord progression, to a tiny change to some text markings; it could be an instrumentation switch, or even adding or subtracting measures. I often go through multiple passes of writing down stuff I\u2019ve already figured out, since by the time I\u2019d done writing it down, I may have figured out more stuff!A lot of the time, I run out of low hanging fruit or have trouble focusing clearly enough for revising to go so easily. That\u2019s when instead of composing directly on the draft print-out, I mark the draft with pre-writing type notes. A lot of times, that amounts to chord by chord analysis and literally listing notes that I could add. Or sometimes, I\u2019ll commandeer empty staves and use them to try out a whole bunch of possible versions of a countermelody or chord voicing. This type of thing is helpful to me because I\u2019m often trying to manage a lot of implied harmonic structures at the same time, so writing them out explicitly shows me where to go next.Once I\u2019ve accreted a whole bunch of penciled in contextual notes, I start chipping away like a sculptor. I\u2019ll have in my head a collection of simple motifs that form the basis of the piece, and I look for patterns in the harmony\u2019s missing notes that could match the shape of one of my motifs. That\u2019s how I can turn a page of pencil scrawled overlapping block chords with 7 notes each into a melody that actually sounds musical. The reason this approach is helpful is that often, I\u2019ll have a draft with a melody, but no bassline, or just two voices, but no chords, etc.Once I have accumulated enough firm decisions on my pencil draft, I go back to the computer and type in the new parts.Before making another print out, I go through some revisions directly on the computer. This stage is less about adding to the musical content and more about polishing the notation, phrasing, and orchestration.I\u2019ll often go through a dozen or more of these revision cycles on a single page of music \u2014 spread out over the entire process of writing the piece. For particularly thorny counterpoint problems and such, I like to work by hand in a manuscript notebook. I also use my notebook to work on motifs and, as I mentioned, to run through permutations of melodies and to do \u201ctop down\u201d sketches of larger sections. I do use the piano, primarily as an aid to getting block chord voicings \u201cjust right.\u201d This is particularly important when writing for brass. I use computer playback very sparingly. ",

            "answer_text": "I rarely compose music on the computer. Something is either just in my ears, or I write it down. Occasionally I do produce my music, but that music usually existed prior, in my head or on paper. My method to making music is that I have no method. It is the 21st century, and by that I mean that everything goes. Sometimes I will write a melody, and then harmonize it. Other times I'll have a chord progression and I'll put a melody to it. When lyrics are involved, sometimes those come first. I will write a melody that matches the inflections of the words. Other times, the melody exists and I find the words to math it. When it comes to form, again, anything goes. I can follow conventional forms, like AABA (or expansions of that). I can also just do whatever I want and do ABCB...DDA or something crazy. It really doesn't matter. If anything, I usually (not always) have some sort of concept in my head first. Usually that concept is a restriction of some sort. For example, I will write a song that doesn't modulate at all. I could also write a song that modulates a minor third up. Another restriction would be only using chord tones in the melody, or not using any chord tones at all. Art thrives on restrictions. If you have some boundaries to work within, it can narrow your choices down. Otherwise, it can be overwhelming. ",
