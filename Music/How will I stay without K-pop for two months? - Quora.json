            "answer_text": "I agree K-Pop has a different sound than other music. I also think there's a lot of variety despite the attachment to the Pop industry and makes you question at what point it is no longer pop music. However, there is hope for satisfying music. If you like hip hop, then turn to other countries. Groups like Monsta x and NCT are hip-hop heavy. I learned this recently and now I realized the groups I stan are mostly hip hop. If you like rock, then American pop rock might sound similar. I did not like EDM or dance music before K-Pop and the stance is not all that shaky. I cannot listen to it outside of K-Pop. ",
