No one is wearing a lamp shade, but the video appears to take place in a dorm room and one of the drummers has a lamp shade right in front of him and even plays it as percussion. It definitely starts with a catchy/snappy bass line. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0BLAEO93g&list=PLlL-T_TuRMEcfiOZpFcVKLjIDmsOo1qPR&index=26&t=0s If not, it could very likely be a different song by them since the bass is very predominant (always a good thing!) and a lot of videos are of them just sitting around and playing. If not, perhaps check out Primus, which is the three piece as you described, to see if they ring any bells. Les Claypool is the leader and bass player and he wears lots of ummm, interesting hats. On Letterman, they dressed up as penguins with red bow ties. I hope you find your song. ",
