            "answer_text": "Ariana is way better than Weeknd. She can hit all of the highest notes with her singing. Weeknd is just a stupid, washed up Michael Jackson wannabe. Ariana is one of the singers in our society that cares about her fans and does it because she cares about the world. Weeknd only cares about himself and the money he makes. Ariana is one of the best singers of this generation and she gets way more attention than Weeknd. ",
