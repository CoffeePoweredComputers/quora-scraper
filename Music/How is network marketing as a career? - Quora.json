            "answer_text": " Network marketing can be a career if you observe the following: Try the waters first Some people see other people making a lot of money in network marketing full time and they feel they must also quit and go into it. No, you don\u2019t know how long that person had been in the business before going full blast. Rather, go into MLM as a side hustle and slowly grow your business. Get some training It\u2019s true, MLM companies often train their new distributors. But what if you registered for one of those online courses? They will prepare you for the business just as any education will make you ready to work in a job. Find the right company There are a lot of MLM product reviews online to help you separate the good from the bad. If you don\u2019t do that and just rush in blindly, you\u2019ll abandon your present opportunity as soon as a shiny new MLM business pops up. If you choose carefully (this section\u2019s advice) and spend time on it (the advice below), you may find success. Put in the effort Do you know why most people become disillusioned with network marketing? They were made to view it as a get-rich-quick system. And when the expected results didn\u2019t come, they quit or became inactive. What they didn\u2019t know is that an MLM, like any other business, calls for hard work and time before seeing the desired results. Have tolerance for volatile earnings Income in any business is like the teeth of the saw, going up and down. You will also experience times of good earnings followed by bad sales or even no sales at all. And in the beginning you shouldn\u2019t expect reliable passive income at all. Be prepared for this, otherwise you can be stressful. Spend your earnings wisely We\u2019re often advised to plough back our earnings into our business to invest in ourselves. While there\u2019s wisdom in that, putting all your network marketing earnings back into upgrades and training packages isn\u2019t advisable. The best way is to invest in activities that will directly produce revenue. Conclusion Yes, network marketing can be a good career path. But be mindful that MLM has serious pitfalls. Forget about easy money. Hard work and the long haul is what awaits you. If you study the business and make an informed decision, then success can be yours. ",

            "answer_text": "For 3% it is the right choice. For 97% it is the wrong choice. I made the wrong choice about 7 times over my life starting back in the 90\u2019s with Amway. I am now Qualified to make the right choice- you are not. That is the honest answer. Someone else answered and implied you would need to \u201ctrust\u201d your chosen upline. The odds of you picking and trusting a 3 percenter is a loosing bet. At least 2 of those 3 percenters built their success indiscriminately off the backs of the 97 percenters. Shame- because the industry has such potential and so many nice people in it that just don\u2019t know that they don\u2019t know what the hell they are doing. The old model of talking to everyone you know and everyone you don\u2019t know and going to meetings and parties is a proven way to not succeed if you have any kind of conviction of soul. If you are ok with leaving bodies in your wake you might muscle through to some success. I can succeed at network marketing because I know local SEO lead generation and how to create an online presence- but 97% of you reading this cannot and will not succeed at network marketing. That\u2019s the math. Beware of pretty people on Youtube who appear to have success and even big checks to show off. They are lying to you and themselves. They have recruit hundreds and lost hundreds. ",
