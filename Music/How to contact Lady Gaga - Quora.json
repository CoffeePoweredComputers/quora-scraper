Contacting Lady Gaga's friends or family directly is a very bad idea. Not only is it rude and inconsiderate but it puts Gaga's friends and family on a very awkward position. They are more than likely bombarded by people trying to get to Lady Gaga on a regular basis. I can almost guarantee that Lady Gaga would disprove of anyone contacting her friends or family directly or even indirectly. Ex Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get in contact with a celebrity personally, especially a celebrity as loved as Gaga. She is constantly being pursued by fans, paparazzi and news outlets. And although she is kind and understanding, she can only meet with a select number of people. The best way to meet Lady Gaga is through a meet and greet. The downside is that these are limited and expensive. You could try tossing a letter onstage during one of her concerts. Another way would be to wait for her outside an appearance that she is making. Then there is contacting her management company, her record company or her PR firm. But keep in mind that there are probably hundreds of others trying to contact her also. So you have to be persistent and don't give up. If your message to her is important enough, she will eventually get it. Good luck! And remember to be patient. ",

The agent works directly for the client, not the recording company which will simply take a message and then likely file it away. Her agent's name is almost certainly in the credits on her CDHer attorney(s) - They are less likely to contact their client, but they might have a measure of influence if your cause seems legitimate.A message to her web site or on social media - A longshot. But a well-crafted message may influence her gatekeepers and allow you brief access to them. From there, you'll have to sell the idea to make her interested.",
