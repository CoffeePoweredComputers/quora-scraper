            "answer_text": "In their heyday, \u201cI Think I Love You\u201d was probably the Partridge Family\u2019s most famous song. It was at one time the number one song in the country (US). If you listened to the radio in 1970, it is very likely you would have heard it being played at least ten times a day.  Other songs that I enjoyed at the time included: I Woke Up in Love This MorningI Can Feel Your HeartbeatI'll Meet You HalfwayI feel compelled to mention that the Partridge Family was not a real singing group. While David Cassidy did sing lead vocal and his step-mother Shirley Jones did sing backup, the instruments and other backup singers were \u2018studio\u2019 musicians. ",
