            "answer_text": "Why should there be a purpose to listening english songs? For me music is not about language but quality, and most of the Bollywood music and any related hindi music is crap so i don't listen to that. Doesn't mean I listen to \u201cEnglish\u201d songs, the new age english songs are crap as well(pop, edm, lot of new pseudo hiphop), so i don't listen to that shit and hate it as much as Bollywood music if not more. Mostly because they are crap, and made for the purpose of making money, none of that is art. But i do listen to indie bands, oldschool hiphop, metal, rock. That's some good shit. They are creating music to Express themselves not make money. And that's why i respect them and listen to them, and there's not much artsis in india doing that, most are engaged in Bollywood and punjabi shit, so i listen to mostly english music. I also listen to other genres, like classical, indian classical. Psychedelic, jazz ;japanese jazz etc. So there's no \u201clanguage\" music i listen to because i think other is cheap and not of my standards etcetc. I listen to music if that's good no matter what language it is.
