            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Ashish Pandey The kind of things mentioned in the linked video, and being thrown out of studio, being rejected etc. hardly comprise dark secrets. There were fairly public spats with music directors, other singers (most notably Mohammad Rafi), but they too don\u2019t really qualify as dark. Specifically the Rafi spat was due to their disagreement about royalty, and in this particular case Lata was unambiguously right. Regarding these spats, there seems to be an adamant streak in Lata\u2019s personality, partially due to the severe struggle during her early career where she was mistreated by a lot of people, which she made her break off professional relations with different people at different times. Perhaps a case of overcompensation, but not really \u201cdark\u201d. Leaving aside professional relations, there are many rumors and a something more than rumors about her personal relations. There are many alleged dark secrets (and some open secrets) about her personal life. I would not want to dwell on them. They add nothing to her musical persona, and take nothing away from her achievements. Unfortunately, in our great land, the woman is always handed the shorter end of the stick in such cases, so please take any rumors, claims and abuses with a pinch of salt. Make that a truck-load. ",
