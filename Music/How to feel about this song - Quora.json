            "answer_text": "Slow start, but worth it. I like how you don't use much profanity.Your rap lyrics are mixed in meaning.For each song find a meaning that you want to project to the listener.The Chorus is bad you don't want to use your own voice and find something catchier, unless you want it to be all rap then it must have very good lyrics. Overall.. 7/10 ( Better than lil wayne) Look up these songs by Wu tang Clan: Cream, Tearz, Protect Ya neck and (Winter Warz by Ghost Face Killah) Good job. ",

            "answer_text": "Pros:-Excellent track, beat is catchy, samples are really good-The lyrical message seems relatable and pretty positive-Outtro is great Cons:-Intro has too long a pause: I'd say let the chimes ring for 4 beats and then kick in-Vocal timing in the verses and pitch in the chorus need to be tightened up-Sexual lyrics don't fit: either change the rest of the lyrics to be harsher and more aggressive, or lose the \"tearing at your breasts\" and the line about getting hard-The lyrical message doesn't seem very clear: do you have everything you want in life, and that's why you're looking for nothing? Overall a good track. ",
