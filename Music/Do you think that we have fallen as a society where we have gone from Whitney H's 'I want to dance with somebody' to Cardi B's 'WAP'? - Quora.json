On the other hand, Bad Religion really hit their stride in the late 80s. One year after \u201cWhitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d, Bad Religion released Suffer, one of my favorite punk rock albums.  Late 80s music has a mix of stuff I enjoy and stuff that bores me.  Modern day music isn\u2019t much different. Here\u2019s a song from this year I find deeply unpleasant.   But there\u2019s some cool stuff as well. I really like Run the Jewels in particular.   There\u2019s good and bad music from pretty much every time period. If you must complain about society because you like late 80s music more, at least use more than two songs as a reference point. ",

You realize all that flowery language is just a fancy way of saying \u201cI want to fuck you\u201d? WAP isn\u2019t really my thing, but I don\u2019t see how someone could really think a sexual rap song is a sign of societal decline in the middle of a pandemic. I assure you it\u2019s nowhere on my list of concerns. ",
