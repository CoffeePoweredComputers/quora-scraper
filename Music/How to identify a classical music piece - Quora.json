            "answer_text": "As opposed to? Do you mean \u201chow do I identify that it is classical\u201d or \u201chow do I identify the composer/name of a classical piece?\u201d I suspect you are asking the latter. If so, the only way is to have a lot of exposure to classical music of all eras. First you should focus on identifying the era or style (medieval, baroque, impressionism, atonal, romantic etc.) Once you can differentiate Debussy from Dowland, and Puccini from Purcell, and Bruch from Bach (tell me to stop), more listening will help you to identify major works, and finally, you should be able to name the era without knowing the composer (someone who sounds like Vivaldi but isn\u2019t). Being able to identify an era/style is the real skill. You can\u2019t memorize every piece written, so you have to recognize styles. Contrapuntal vs. not contrapuntal, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing like experience in making such judgements, and the matter of whether a piece is \u201cclassical\u201d or \u201cearly romantic\u2019 is not of critical importance in listening and enjoying. However, a couple of easy places to begin. You will learn to recognize the balance and regular phraseology in \u2018classical\u2019 music, and in piano, the Alberti Bass, C-G-E-G. C-G-E-G in the accompaniment. Doesn\u2019t alway happen, but it\u2019s a tendency. In an orchestra, double woodwinds: 2 flutes, 2 clarinets, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, two timpani and no additional percussion\u2014that\u2019s \u2018classical.\u2019. Any \u2018funny instrument,\u2019 English Horn, Piccolo, Trombones, Tuba, Bass Clarinet, Contra-Bassoon\u2014these imply later music, mid-romantic period probably. Cymbals, Bass Drum, Triangle\u2014all occur rarely in \u2018Classical\u201d music, anything more in percussion almost guarantees later music. There is a Mozart Opera which uses a keyboard glockenspiel, but xylophone or more than 2 timpani almost always rule out \u2018classical\u2019 music. If you hear a piano with cymbals (seriously) that was the rage in the \u2018classical\u2019 period, Turkish Music, but you never hear it today. I\u2019d like to. All of these considerations are minor fluff compared to \u2018listening to the music,\u2019 gaining the flavor of it, and witnessing clarity, balance, decorum, and restraint, the regular phrases, the elegance. Even early Beethoven piano sounds a bit \u2018rustic\u2019 to me, vigorous, and indelicate compared to Mozart, which sounds \u2018proper,\u2019 elegant, and slightly reserved. Mozart\u2019s orchestra music sounds a bit restrained to me, maybe impersonal slightly\u2014though I love Mozart, this is the flavor I get. But, as in any example of sophistication, of exquisite taste, or sophisticated judgement, experience is all! And that\u2019s the fun of Classical (and Baroque and Romantic) music\u2014even contemporary music!\u2014listen, be surprised, hear the growth, love it all! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean in general, or is there a specific piece you want to know about? It helps a lot to know a little bit about music history, and what is called \u201cactive listening\u201d - meaning you don\u2019t listen to it as background music or distraction, but you focus on it and pay ateention to details - melodic theme, orchestration, structure, etc. In general, start by narrowing down the period and genre, per Chris\u2019s answer below. It can require some detective work on your part, or ask someone you know who is into that style of music, that composer, that era. Trying to identify one specific piece of music can be a challenge if you don\u2019t have much to go on, other than your own ears. That\u2019s why even a one semester course in music history can be invaluable for anybody - it really helps a lot when you\u2019re getting familiar with different kinds of music. ",

If you live in an area with a classical radio station you can listen to that, or you can listen on the internet on YouTube, etc. People recognize the pieces they are familiar with, so you need to listen and gain familiarity with the basic repertoire. Learn to listen for the various motifs or melodic shapes and what instruments are playing them. If you spend enough time listening and can also read musical notation and hear it in your mind, you can even get to the point of recognizing pieces you are familiar with just by looking at a page of the score.

Each period of music has its own characteristics, and by listening carefully, you can ascertain what a Mozart piano concerto has in common with a Haydn symphony or a Scarlatti sonata, thus becoming fluent in aspects of the so-called classical style. Repeat for other genres. ",

On the other hand, a lot of music, especially getting into the Romantic period and beyond, is \u201cprogram music\u201d where there is definitely a meaning involved.

Unless you are a music major or music professional, or it\u2019s a very famous piece, most people just remember the composer and what type of piece it was. So you might remember \u201c it was a Beethoven piano sonata\u201d but unless it\u2019s the famous Moonlight sonata you probably won\u2019t remember more than that. But if you have a good aural memory you often only need listen to a brief passage to remember if it\u2019s the one you\u2019re thinking of. A few classical pieces have been given names to help us remember them. Mozart\u2019s \u201cJupiter\u201d symphony for example. ",
