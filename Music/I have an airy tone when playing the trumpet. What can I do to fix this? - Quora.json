            "answer_text": "An \u201cairy\u201d tone is typically caused by an INEFFICIENT EMBOUCHURE APERTURE. Most often the lips are too far apart, or the aperture \u2014 the \u201chole\u201d through which the air passes between your lips \u2014 is of the wrong shape. How do we improve the shape? With lots of patient experimentation! (See below.) Most people with an airy tone also find it very hard to play SOFTLY, because the same inefficient lip aperture that causes the airiness also won\u2019t let you play softly. If you can improve your soft playing, your tone will probably get less airy. Therefore, a good way to improve your tone is to dedicate some time each day to VERY SOFT long tones, starting ppp with a slow crescendo to pp or p and then a slow diminuendo back to ppp. Try to start each tone WITHOUT TONGUING: just start blowing very softly. You\u2019ll probably hear \u201cFFFFFF\u201d (air only) and then suddenly the tone will start. Your goal is for the tone to start instantly (at an extremely soft level), as soon as the very first molecules of air pass between your lips. This means that the lips, tongue, jaw, instrument angle, abdominal muscles, etc., all have to be just right \u2014 BEFORE you start blowing. Not tense or stiff, just in the perfect position, waiting for your air to start passing between the lips. Rest a lot between attempts \u2014 if your lips are even a little tired, your practice session will do you much less good. Don\u2019t do too much in a single session. It\u2019s better to do just a few minutes every day. Do this in a variety of registers (but, at the beginning, not the very highest notes). You\u2019ll soon discover that if you want the sound to start cleanly with no air, you will need to find the ideal lip position, jaw position, instrument angle, muscles to tense and muscles to relax, etc. for EACH register. Don\u2019t be afraid to try a variety of different positions and angles! A few hints to get you started: Most trumpet players nowadays change the angle of their instrument according to register. In the lowest register, they tilt their head down \u2014 just a little \u2014 and the bell of the instrument up. As they ascend, their head raises a bit, and the trumpet bell starts to move down. This movement is most obvious in the lowest octave of the instrument.The low register requires a more open aperture, with the lips slightly more separated.Use only moderate mouthpiece pressure against your lips. A \u201cno-pressure\u201d embouchure is not desirable, but excessive pressure can be very damaging.And \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT! \u2014 remember that you need a firm abdomen to support the air you are blowing. This is ESPECIALLY true when playing softly! Firm up your abdominal muscles a few seconds BEFORE you start blowing, not after.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "It could be the instrument. Spit valves can leak air. Try squeezing the spit valve tightly closed while playing a long tone. The little cork can be easily replaced. Worn valve pistons are a bigger problem. If you have a very expensive horn, it might be worth getting your valves refurbished. If not, it would be better to get a different horn. You might need a different mouthpiece. If your emboucher and attack are the problem, that is a matter to consult with a good brass teacher. In fact, all of these matters would be best appraised by a pro. You might ask at a music store if you could take a single lesson. Sometimes there is a knowledgeable player working in a store, but they could be more of a salesperson looking for a commission. Good luck with all that. It's a worthwhile pursuit. Added: The answer here by Doug McClure is an excellent discussion of the physical discipline involved in tone production. ",
