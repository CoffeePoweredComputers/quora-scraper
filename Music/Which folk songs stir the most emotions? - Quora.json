            "answer_text": "About twenty years ago, I was at a destination-wedding weekend for a high-school buddy on Isle of Palms, South Carolina. One night, we went to a bar in downtown Charleston. There was a band playing, and, at some point during the set, the band played the 1859 song \u201cDixie,\u201d which, while a popular song in 1859, is now considered a folk song. The men with hats in the band and the crowd would doff their caps in rhythm to the \u201clook aways\u201d grouped in threes throughout the song. As a guy from Chicago, I was quite unsettled by this. I noticed there were no black folks in this bar, and I imagined this particular bar was one black folks knew\u2014in one way or another\u2014was not a bar they should go to. The song has been controversial for African-Americans for a long time. Steve Earle, who spent his formative years in Texas and Tennessee but now lives in New York City, wrote a great song called \u201cMississippi, It\u2019s Time.\u201d In it, he sings, \u201cDixieland will never miss me, but I whistle that tune sometimes. / And I\u2019ll sing it loud when the flag comes down; / Mississippi, don\u2019t you reckon it\u2019s time.\u201d Earle is referring to Mississippi\u2019s state flag still containing the Confederate battle flag within it, which put on the flag in 1894, some twenty-nine years after the end of the Civil War.
