            "answer_text": "Royalties are something that are discussed prior to the playing of the song. There are companies whos sole purpose is to find networks illegally using music for personal gain. In the case of streaming platforms such as YouTube, there are programs in place to identify copywritten material and to disperse 100% royalties to the production company. Artists and streaming networks negotiate royalty percentage terms prior to playing a song; even on YouTube. There are many Youtubers who perform cover songs and negotiate small royalty payouts. ",
