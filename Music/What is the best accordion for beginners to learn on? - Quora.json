            "answer_text": "I actually have a different opinion than Larry on this than Larry.   I have liquidated an accordion shop.  One of my closest friends in the world was Walter Kuhr who owned the wonderful Main Squeeze Accordions on the lower east side in NYC.    When he passed away, I had to learn a lot about accordions to take care of the closing of the store, so I did. Also through Walter, I learned a LOT about buying accordions.  Let me tell you, it's easy to buy shit.  There are a few questions before anyone can give you a good answer. 1.) Do you know how to play piano? If so, you've got a head start and I'd say you could definitely start with a 24 bass or even a 48 bass.  If not, you want to look into 12 bass and 24 bass only. It also helps when it comes to buying an accordion. 2.) What kind of music do you want to play? You can play a wide variety of music on a piano accordion, but if you want to play Irish button or Cajun -- don't waste your time on a piano accordion only to have to learn a completely new instrument.  Cajun accordions and Irish button are a WORLD of difference. 3.) How serious are you?   In other words, if you just want to see how you like it, then I'd actually suggest you just rent one for a week. (depending on where you live, I guess.) But if you know that you want to learn this thing and you'll stick with it a few years, then spend some more money, and definitely get 24 bass. 4.) Where do you live? I'll get to why this is important a little later.          ABOUT BUYING ACCORDIONS. Point #1 I'm going to say this once, and I'm going to be borderline offensive about it. If you buy your first accordion off Ebay, you've either got shit for brains.   I don't know how else to say it. People selling accordions cheap on Ebay usually are along the lines of \"Found this in my uncle's attic.  Seems to work perfectly.  Has a full keyboard.  $200 plus shipping.\" Congratulations.  You just bought yourself a really expensive doorstop. Here's why. I know they're built like air conditioners, but believe it or not, accordions don't age well when they're left on their own. Inside the accordion are three fragile things:  wax/glue, leather strips,  and steel strips.  Lots and lots of steel strips. And when the accordion is stored in an attic or anywhere that's not the correct temperature three things happen.   The wax glue crumbles, the leather curls and the steel rusts. And that, my friend, is expensive to fix.  But if you don't fix it, it's like playing a piano that's been thrown out of tune.  You can't fix it yourself.  You have to hire a pro. Point #2 And the above is why it's great if you have played piano before -- because then you can test out the scales.  Play every scale.  The entire circle of fifths.   Then ask the person to play the bass side scales if you're not able to. If you don't know all the scales, see if you can get your hands on an electronic tuner, or a buddy that plays music. Point #3 See it in person.   Don't have it shipped to you.   That's why \"where do you live\" is important.  If you live in a remote area, you might not have a lot of accordionists around you. But shipping an accordion is a hideous thing.  You need to dissemble it and have the reeds wrapped separately.   If it's small like a student hohner then it doesn't need to be dissembled, but it does still need to be shipped correctly or the thing WILL, and I mean WILL be damaged in transit. So try to get your hands on the instrument before you buy it.  And if you get it in a shop, you'll know it's properly tuned. And Larry's advice about smelling the accordion for must and bellow leaks.  Always bad signs. On to the accordions... STUDENT HOHNER The absolute, positive go-to student accordion is the student hohner and if you can  get this one cheap, you should hop on it: student hohner  (sorry, sold mine.) These are German made (mostly-- there are some made in China I've heard.)  These will last.  They're like the Volvos of accordions.   Importantly, when it comes time to sell the accordion, you will probably sell it for what you paid for it.   They're everlasting. CHINESE ACCORDIONS I would definitely buy a new low-end Chinese accordion than buy a used piece of shit.   ",

            "answer_text": "A good 12 bass accordion is perfect for a brand new beginner. When the student is ready for minor and 7\u2019th bass chords it is time to move up to a 120 bass model. An accordion with 3 shifts on the treble keyboard and 2 for the bass button board. A little later with some more experience most accordionists will want at least a 7 shift treble and a 4 shift bass accordion. The age and previous music experience of the player will determine what size and model is best for them when it is time to move up to a 120 bass. Hope this helps. ",
