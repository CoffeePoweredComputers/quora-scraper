            "answer_text": "He was fantastic as a guitarist. He has probably played guitar on more albums that just about anyone living today. His guitar touched the landmark recordings of his time. That\u2019s his rhythm line on Sinatra\u2019s Strangers in the Night, his comeback hit from 1966; he played bubblegum riffs for the Monkees; his guitar rings out on Viva Las Vegas by Presley and, alongside his voice, on the Beach Boys\u2019 landmark album Pet Sounds. His association with Brian Wilson was particularly fortuitous. The Beach Boys auteur co-wrote Guess I\u2019m Dumb, Campbell\u2019s first single. Even though the song failed to chart, Campbell joined the band for a five-month tour in 1964-65 where he replaced Wilson, playing his bass and singing his falsetto leads, after Wilson suffered a breakdown and refused to go on the road. He was part of The Wrecking Crew who played on many of the Phil Spector recordings. He also played on Good Vibrations. Charlie Daniels said in an emailed statement that Campbell \u201cfilled a niche in American music that very few people have ever reached \u2026 He represented the best of the pop and the best of country, and he pulled people in from both sides. It was a great thing for country music, and frankly, for pop music\u201d In short he was a much better guitarist than you can probably imagine. You may not like his style of playing but his expertise cannot be disputed for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "BEFORE Glen Campbell was popular as a singer, he was a VERY sought after Studio Musician and a member of The Wrecking Crew. Time in the Studio is $$$$ and musicians have to get it right the FIRST time. So, to be as sought after as a musician as he was demonstrates he was a GREAT musician. I remember seeing him when I was a kid on several television shows playing the HECK out of guitars (I don\u2019t know about other instruments) and he inspired me to learn the guitar. To see how good he is, Google \u201cGlen Campbell Shredding guitar\u201d and look at the YouTube videos that pop up. He was blindingly fast, accurate and could play almost any style. When Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys had to bow out for a while, they asked him to go on tour with him playing bass. That meant he had to 1) play bass, 2) play bass WELL \u2019cause some of the bass lines in Beach Boys music is pretty complex 3) Sing well\u2026. All are aspects of good musicianship. Check him out on YouTube. You\u2019ll be amazed. ",
