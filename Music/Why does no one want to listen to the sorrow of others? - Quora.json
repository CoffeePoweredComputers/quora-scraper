            "answer_text": "There is a very old and established rule of demand and supply \u2026 which unfortunately is applicable to our modern day society as well\u2026. sorrow is more in supply thus less in demand. and happiness is less in supply thus more in demand . jokes apart - let's come to human psychology which reads future positively and thus positivity is but essential and inspiring for life. Peep into every four wall and you will find lots of pandora boxes all open and people inside all chaotic . ( the story of pandora box - don't open - yet was done and pain and trouble walked into everyone\u2019s life .) Every four walled house has at least one overpowering sad story which after it's very long echoes , don't desire a mention of it - tired , fatigued and enervated , so when they walk out they are like butterflies who seek beauty, solace , bliss, calmness and reenergising moments in the nature . I remember my parents had funny dynamics - every time either one was on total fire and the other trying to manage burning coals , and the worst hit was the hapless kid who unfortunately loved both yet knew not what to do ? Perplexed and traumatic - a bad combination. Then when I settled I decided to be the bearing Hercules because had seen one has to have calmness to let the fire down , over the years the practised helped and then worst followed the saturation and I found can take no more except logic decade was consumed before logic settled as the basic law . Otherwise it's natural that the game of dominance sparks off with every two people- who suffers ? - The kids . Then the question why the wisdom could not overpower saturation ? The reason was to stop the negative bully game and set logic as the rule. now why this discussion ? Because this is core story of every house , sometimes not between couples then some conspiring devil or a vamp. Who is trapped? - only the innocent kids. When these innocent Kids grow up they unfortunately have been silent spectator to the psychological ruckus and have had more than their due of non- sense , they know they too may have to go through this funny tug of war with ropes . So when someone comes to them with their sorrow tale they may be trapped accidentally once to listen but preferably they deny to lend an ear and make it a point not to do so. They know it's a helpless condition where nothing would come out of it rather they would be reminded of their childhood woes . SO BETTER to Avoid sorrow yes once very close friends then they help and if pushed long to be a helpless spectator they prefer to quit. i think in the long run, some where the governing bodies need to come up with rules to administer peace and accountability in those four walls.

            "answer_text": "It's not like people don't want to listen to sorrows. I mean I would listen to sorrows I do that a lot actually. But there are some people if you're like really good at observing and noticing people. You'll find them talking everybody around them being all friendly and happy as if there's nothing to worry about but deep inside they've way more worries than you. They just don't wanna be vulnerable in front of people. If you share your sorrows to these people, they say that they don't care cause they already enough of their plate to deal with. People can be really selfish at times, you can't help it you can try changing them maybe you'll be successful maybe you won't. What you can do is when you feel super down just write it in a diary or write poems which display your feelings it really helps you know. You should try sharing it with someone whom you feel will be there for you when you need them. In the end, I'll say that have a good judge of character or people. It'll be very helpful in life. Hope you've a great day ahead ! ",
