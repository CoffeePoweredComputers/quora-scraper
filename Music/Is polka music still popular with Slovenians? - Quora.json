I\u2019m a finnish decent guy and there are many in this area along with Polish people, Italians, German and Croatian. Most of these all liked to polka or listen to it. This was back in 1968 on up. This kind of music is popular with the people of many countries to this day and probably will always be enjoyed by them. ",
