            "answer_text": "When I compose though I normally start with a simple idea. It could be some chords or just a simple melody. Then add to it. Knowing scales is extremely helpful in composing but knowing what you want to hear is even more important. Once you have a simple idea down try improvising something over that till you have something you like. Then work on that until its exactly what you want to hear. Rhythm is the most important aspect of any music so keep that in mind. Its often the notes you don't hear that make the biggest difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Study, but not too much. Choose an instrument and learn its possibilities and limitations. Do Not Go Overboard. Choose a style. Hunt and peck. Do alternate arrangements of existing tunes. Get some staff paper. I started writing when I had taken piano lessons for a couple of years. I had zero talent. I wrote a simple line tune.   Beethoven's 5th symphony is based on four notes with perpetual play on time and tone. I wrote music of sorts. I wrote poetry of sorts. I do needlework. I build furniture. To me, it is all music; a creative expression from idea to reality. ",
