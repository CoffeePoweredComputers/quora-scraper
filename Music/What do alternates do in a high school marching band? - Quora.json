            "answer_text": "This was one of the biggest culture shocks I encountered when I came to Texas. \u201cNon-varsity\u201d marching band?? I didn\u2019t come from one of these programs, so I don\u2019t have firsthand experience of a varsity/non-varsity marching band. However, here are my observations as a college student of how some of the programs around here handle it: At some point in the middle of band camp, students audition for placement in the primary or alternate blocks. The students who are the strongest musically and visually are placed in the primary block, while students who are weaker or less experienced are placed in the alternate block. Students in the primary block will march and play the music of the competition halftime show. In the beginning of the season, students in the alternate block will still learn the music and drill of the competition show. They will have simpler drill, usually in a corner on the back sideline of the field. However, after the first few football games, students in the alternate block will transition to their competition roles, which may involve moving props and equipment before, during, and after the halftime show. They continue this until the end of the season. There are many elements that the whole band does together, especially for football games. For example, some schools do a \u201cpre-show\u201d before their competition show that may include playing a standstill tune with the dance team/drill team/assorted spirit squads. Also, all students play pep tunes in the stands during the game. I know that most directors stress that all students, whether primary block or alternate block, are integral members of the band program. They are committed to helping all students develop and grow as musicians and individuals. I still don\u2019t quite understand it, coming from a band program where my high school director insisted that \u201cThere\u2019s no second string in marching band.\u201d But I do know that some of these marching bands with primary and alternate positions produce high-quality performances and superb musicians. I\u2019ll try to reserve judgment until I\u2019ve taught myself and seen it in action for a few years. ",

            "answer_text": "Two years ago we had more kids in out band than we needed. I think it had something to do with us not wanting to be put in the higher class at competitions so we marched alternates. Basically every other run during practice and every other show/competition the kids would switch out. The alternate and their partner take turns marching the dot. Other than that it's no different from a regular marcher ",
