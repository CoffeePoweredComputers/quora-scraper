            "answer_text": "In my opinion, these are some best stage looks! Dahyun (also known as Elsa) in Feel Special  Dahyun looked so stunning in this outfit! The iridescent blue is really pretty against her fair skin. Jennie (SOLO)  This outfit looks so beautiful on Jennie\u2019s figure. I love how the simplicity of the white really compliments the lacy accents. LOONA (Butterfly)  These outfits are so gorgeous and elegant. I love the feminine yet understated silhouette. Chung Ha (Snapping)  The layering of the chains and belts is really nice. Overall, the outfit co-ordinates perfectly with her hair and makeup. Momo (Like Ooh-Ahh)  This outfit really shows off Momo\u2019s athletic figure. It\u2019s also perfect for her dance break. Joy (Peekaboo)  Joy just looks stunning in this. There\u2019s not much else to say. Ryujin (WANNABE)  Ryujin has such nice curves and this outfit really accentuates them. Also, the cropped boxy jacket is pretty cool. Red Velvet (Bad Boy)  I love how the outfits match so well, but simultaneously have different vibes to them. All the girls look confident and fierce. IZ*ONE (FIESTA)  These outfits perfectly encapsulate the energy and youthfulness of the song. I love the variation in colour and patterns. Thank you for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "*My personal favourites* This outfit worn by Sana is one of my all time favourites, she suits this colour so well. I wish she would wear pink more often! 2) Another pink outfit worn by Sana, the performances at the end of 2019 really had gorgeous stage outfits.  3) This staging had beautiful outfits, Nayeon\u2019s is such a pretty colour especially around her shoulders.  4) Dahyun\u2019s outfit for this staging is also lovely, the sparkly outfits TWICE wore at the end 2019 suited each member.  5) I love all of these silver outfits except Dahyun\u2019s seems different to the others. My favourite is Jeongyeon\u2019s as it suits her short dark hair so well.  6) All of these outfits are so different to their old style, a girl crush style suits them so well!! My favourite outfit is Chaeyoung\u2019s, I love the chain details on the shorts.  7) Dahyun\u2019s ICONIC Elsa outfit has to be mentioned.  8) Even though this dress is too short Nayeon looks fab in red.  9) Sana\u2019s is my fave but I LOVE these stage outfits  10) This outfit for HYLT worn by Lisa, the dark purple looks so cool against her dark short hair.

The bottom is a little bit short but the outfit as a whole looks really pretty  4. I love this kind of outfits ; giving a royal vibe  5. A pretty simple outfit but the colour and design it\u2019s looking very good in my opinion  6. The shiny things on it make it 100% better  7. I find the patterns and the writings really pretty  8. Maybe some people will disagree with this one but I like the colour , the design and the belt  9. Again an outfit which gives me elegant vibes  10. I won\u2019t explain it\u2019s obvious  11.Jisoo in red is just \ud83e\udd29  ",
