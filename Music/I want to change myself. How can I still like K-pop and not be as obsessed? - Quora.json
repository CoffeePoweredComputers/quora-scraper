            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t mean to be harsh, and I apologize in advance if this sounds harsh. Do something else. I know this initially sounds ridiculous but hear me out: It is very difficult not to do something. It is extremely difficult to not do something you are addicted to. If all you do is focus on not doing something, that is all you will think about, all day long. If, however, you do something else and get your mind involved with that, that is where you, here and now, will be. That puts your mind in the moment, in living right now. For example, when I am flying in difficult weather conditions I am extremely busy managing the airplane, navigating around the worst parts, and talking to air traffic control, but I love it. I am completely in the moment. I am far too busy to think about any cares \u2013 \u2013 serious or small \u2013 \u2013 I am completely involved with the activity at hand. If you can find something healthy to do that keeps you fully involved, you will be on your way to solving your problem. In conclusion, don\u2019t not do something, do something! ",
