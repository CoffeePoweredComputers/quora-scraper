            "answer_text": "Schubert wrote nine symphonies. Possibly the best known is the eighth symphony, the Unfinished, which has two movements rather than the more common four. The first movement has Schubert's trademark lyrical melodies, while the second is almost painfully beautiful. All the symphonies have lovely melodies , l think Schubert surpassed even Mozart for memorable tunes. The ninth symphony, the Great C Major, has towering majesty in addition to these wonderful melodies, but all Schubert's symphonies are worth knowing. ",
