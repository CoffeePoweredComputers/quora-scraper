            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a huge fan of Hank Williams. His songs tell a tragic tale of his life. His honest delivery and raw emotion can make the listener feel his pain. And then, their are some Hank songs where the emotion is real but not sad. \u201cSettin\u2019 the Woods on Fire\u201d is a great example where the listener can feel the honest joy and anticipation of a hot date later that evening. But then, sometimes even Ted Williams would strike out. So did Hank. If you want pure, unadulterated hokey, then this song is for you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hokey: mawkish, sentimental and contrived, originated in the 1940\u2019s from \u2018Hokum\u2019 There\u2019s an entire sub-genre. It\u2019s called \u2018Bro-Country\u2019. Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line are some of clear examples of the type. Bro-country is mawkish and sentimental (for old high school football players gone to seed) and completely contrived. It doesn\u2019t call back to the past unless it\u2019s rose-shifted. It doesn't learn from rock (like Corb Lund) or hardcore (like John Moreland). It\u2019s not even an interesting melding (like Gangstagrass) ",
