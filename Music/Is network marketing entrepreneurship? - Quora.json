            "answer_text": "Network Marketing is by no means equal to being an entrepreneur, the majority of network marketers should be seen as franchise takers, since they pretty much are on the same level as a franchise, take a McDonald's franchise for instance, you buy a license from the company to sell their products following their system to generate a profit, in Network Marketing it is the exact same thing, (with one minor glitch, most McDonald franchise owners make a profit, most network marketers don't...*) neither is an entrepreneur they are both licensed franchise owners.   The line between someone who is self-employed, a franchise owner and entrepreneur may seem very thin but what actually sets the entrepreneur apart is the mindset that many franchise owners and self-employed or business owners would love to have yet lack is high self esteem and that the entrepreneur doesn't think they control their destiny they know it breath it and live it, a mindset that takes a while to achieve if you are not born with it, thus an entrepreneur could be a any of the three but that doesn't make any of the three automatically an entrepreneur.  *As to my comment about network marketers not making money I believe I can explain the reason for it as well, if interested please read on if not the answer to the initial question ended above. The reason for this is two fold in my opinion, first a franchise like McDonald's is going to cost you upwards of 1 million with at least 500k in liquid capitol and roughly a 40-50k yearly franchise fee, meaning the franchise taker has money, possibly from being a successful business person or maybe an entrepreneur which is equal to hard work in both cases.  A starter kit (your franchise fee) in a network marketing company will run normally under one hundred dollars, your first product order will run you around 50-3K if you are serious you should be willing to invest at least 1-3k, so the first reason is plain to see if you open a McDonald's you already have money, chances are when you start in network marketing as distributor you don't, so asking someone to order 3k let alone 1k seems impossible to most of them.  The next thing is the mindset that comes with the price tag, if you invest 1 million in something you are going to make damn well sure you do what needs to be done to make your profit, if you invest 100 to 3000 and your time, most figure oh well it wasn't that much anyway and they/you don't take it as a serious business, no one gets rich off such a small investment now do they... (Irony Alert) no one started in their living room or garage selling someone else's products and became a millionaire...  ",

            "answer_text": "Entrepreneurship is about setting your business. A business has two basic aspects: product and its sales. When you have an entrepreneurship idea and you start working on it, you have your problem solving product. You market it and get sales. Here you spend your time/money resources on more production as well as more sales. While franchise type businesses like network marketing gives you a ready product. You just have to market it your way and bring sales through your channel. More sales means more money. So you spend your time entirely on managing your team and breaking your previous sales record each week. Each of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. When you own a company, you spend money on production while earn money on sales. A slight mistake on production calculation and lot of items might just remain unsold. Your overall profit is less. While in network marketing the risk isn\u2019t on you. You don\u2019t spend time on production calculation. You make sales and you earn the promised profit, not less. Hence they say there is less risk in network marketing business. But still there is a drawback in network marketing that you don\u2019t have control over the product lining. Before I started working in my startup, I\u2019ve been in network marketing company which sells web hosting for more than 52 weeks (because my performance&income was per week based). I\u2019ve received feedback from prospects, teammates. You can sell only what they have. It\u2019s really hard to get your suggestion approved by directors and even if approved time it takes to be implemented isn\u2019t on your control. Lot of times I wished, I just need to own a company to make some difference. Secondly, margin earned while selling a franchised product is significantly less than when you create your own product and sell it. So, it\u2019s a matter of perspective that whether a Network Marketer is a entrepreneur or just another salesman. In my opinion, a fairly successful network marketer is an entrepreneur as he has those business building skills like business building vision, motivation even in bad times and leading to develop each team member instead of being bossy. But the real adventure is being a startup entrepreneur. ",
