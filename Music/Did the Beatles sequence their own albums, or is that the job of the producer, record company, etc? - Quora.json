            "answer_text": "That is typically the job of the producer. A producer may have decided, for example, for a fast rocker A-side and a slow balladish B-Side (when those things still existed). The Beatles didn\u00b4t have much choice in their first albums, EMI did that, specially in America. But beginning with Sgt Pepper, they took total creative control, including sequencing. Pepper was meticulously arranged by The Beatles, song order and all. Paul took a special pride in the White Album. Recently he said that the most outstanding thing about that album was its sequencing. He is right. The WA is a wild collection of hard rock, granny music, country, blues, sweet ballads and experimental avant-garde. How do you put Revolution 9, Obladi Oblada and Don\u00b4t Pass me by in the same package? George Martin suggested a single album because it was impossible to produce order with that chaos. But the band worked in the sequencing and they did a fine job. The White Album flows perfectly, which was probably the greatest triumph in the making of that two-record set. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitol Records in America had total control of track order, including which, if any, tracks would be used, on all albums through Revolver. Capitol retained track control on albums not released in the UK after that. (Eg. Hey Jude [US only], but not The Beatles [US and UK.]) Capitol also had final production rights on all US releases. For The Beatles 1962 - 1966, and The Beatles 1967 - 1970 (Red and Blue Albums), de facto Beatles manager Alan Klein controlled the tracks and their listing. In the UK, George Martin, head of Parlophone, controlled the listing\u2014so, you know the band had input\u2014until Sgt. Pepper. After that, the band decided. (Probably more like John and Paul. Probably mostly Paul.) ",

            "answer_text": "There was also a technical issue due to the physics of how the available space gets squeezed towards the end of an LP record; (cuts here are quieter and exhibit more distortion). I am sure George Martin knew about this since the choice has always been to lay the strongest cuts first and the weakest tracks closer to the inner groove. Singles were cut to 45 RPM with a not so awesome B-side. Although the B-side of Let it be was \u201cYou Know My Name (Look up the Number)\u201d was one of those tracks in which I always wondered if it was cut or recorder at a slightly lower speed to get that awesome growly dark sound.
