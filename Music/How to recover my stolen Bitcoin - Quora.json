            "answer_text": "The thought of putting your trust in a company, investing with them and end up getting scammed out of your funds is just terrible and more strict laws should be made to battle the loss of such funds. I\u2019ve also been a victim of investment scam in the past and after writing to the company for withdrawals i started to notice something fishy. They didn\u2019t respond properly and was asking me to pay more money for tax and other bills which was clear it was a scam. I reported the case to law enforcement and also to my bank to see if i could get just a little percentage back into my account which was totally futile and got me more worried. I was about to give up until i found a recovery company that was able to assist me with the recovery of my funds. Most people told me it was a scam and i shouldn\u2019t trust anyone that nobody can bring back my funds into my account but i decided to follow my instinct and go with the recovery company and it was the best decision I've made because the were able to recover my funds into my account and i also made some profits out of it because of the rise of bitcoins then, which made me really happy.

            "answer_text": "What exactly do the scammers do? A person will get a random call from a broker saying that he can make a 30% return every single week trading Forex. All he has to do is open a Luno account; a crypto wallet that enables you to store various cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and buys 200$ worth of bitcoin and then sends it to a particular trading platform to start making some money. Once you deposit the cryptocurrency you might find yourself unable to access your trading account, or, even if you are able to access your account, they do not let you withdraw your funds. These trading platforms sometimes claim that in order to withdraw your funds you need to first deposit an additional 200$ in order to start the withdrawal process. why would you have to give someone more money in order to withdraw money that you put there in the first place?! But, you can still try to get your money back. Here\u2019s How 1. CONTACT THEM Send a letter to the trading platform that took your cryptocurrency telling them if they do not return your money that you will report them to the financial authorities. While this can\u2019t guarantee that they will give you your money back, when followed by action, your efforts could pay off. 2. REPORT THEM The next step is, of course, to actually report them to the relevant financial authorities like the police or a firm that can help you get back your money like e-assetsretrieval .org (Reporting a scam should always be done, whether or not you can get your money back, if you\u2019ve confirmed your fears and there is no explanation for why they haven\u2019t given your money back or allowed you to withdraw from your account it is yours and every individual\u2019s responsibility to report criminal activity to the government so that the government can take action.) 3. GET CREATIVE There are many ways in which a private investigator may go about finding information for a case. If you\u2019re intent on getting your money back, you may ask yourself, have I exhausted all options in getting my money back, what if it was a million dollars? Would I throw in the towel now? Start by publicizing your story online in any way you can. For example, post the name of the broker on Facebook or Reddit to see if there are others who have information on this company or any clues as to how you could get your money back. This may also help prevent others from falling prey to the scam as well. 4. NOTIFY YOUR CRYPTO WALLET PROVIDER Contact your crypto wallet and notify them that the company you paid is a scam and is refusing to give your money back. This will raise awareness and ultimately jeopardize the scams relationship with the crypto wallet which may also help prevent others from being scammed. 5. SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL While this may not be an option for many as lawyers fees can often exceed the amount of the money lost. However, there are scenarios where legal advice may help point you in the direction of steps that you could take to pursue the crypto scam company. ",
