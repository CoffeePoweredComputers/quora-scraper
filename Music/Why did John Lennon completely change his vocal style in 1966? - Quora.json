            "answer_text": "I don't agree that John Lennon completely changed his vocal style after 1966. Just listen to his performances on Live Peace In Toronto to hear the \u201cold\u201d John singing. However, Lennon never liked his singing voice. Over the years he sought to alter it in a variety of ways. The first thing he discovered was double-tracking his vocals. In 1966, ADT (automatic double tracking) was introduced at Abbey Road. John used it on every song. As the technology to manipulate the voice grew, John seemed to try it. He used varispeed (manipulating the speed of the tape either faster or slower while recording, which was done manually at Abbey Road), sang through a megaphone, recorded vocals lying down, or upside down, used massive amounts of echo, etc\u2026. This continued right up until his last recordings. One specific \u201ctell\u201d that John\u2019s songs on Milk And Honey were unfinished was that they weren't double-tracked. During the mixing, extra echo was added to give the effect of a fuller vocal. Beyond the things John did to his voice intentionally, you should factor in his age, weight, and drugs of choice as possible factors in the change in his vocals. ",

            "answer_text": "Consider what happened August 1966- the Beatles decided to stop being \u2018Pop Stars\u2019 exhausting themselves in endless touring. Instead, they wished to further develop as serious musicians creating quality music in the studio. No more playing a part in front of an audience, no more creating \u2018Hit\u2019 records for AM radio. I\u2019m guessing John\u2019s reaction to this was to further explore music that came from his soul (he claims it started with Help!), without regard as to whether it fit in with a \u2018Fab Four\u2019 image or top 40 playlist. The songs became more intimate, personal, and carthartic. This probably meant his style of presentation of his lyrics evolved to a more mature vocalizing. Note this could be a subtle style (In my Life), OR a tired, exhausted style (I\u2019m only sleeping, Girl) OR a raging, purging style (Yer Blues). Sometimes all three in the same song (I\u2019m so tired). But certainly no more \u2018Please please me\u2019 Beatle John vocals\u2026 ",
