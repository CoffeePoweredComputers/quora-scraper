            "answer_text": "Date:- June 2, 2013 She walked in with those darting eyes and her straight dark glossy hairs cascaded down her back. I always thought she looked pretty, but the \u2018azure blue\u2019 dress she was wearing made her look like a princess. \u2018 I have zero knowledge regarding any shades of any color, but I googled until I found the exact shade\u2019 After all she had been my crush for the past 5 years. It was a get together party after our high school results. It was almost 2 months since we last met, and probably the last because I was changing the school. Almost after 15 minutes of her arrival, she came to the drinks counter, where I was sitting and started a conversation. She :- Hi, been a few days since we met. Me :- Was a bit busy. Inner me :- Come on Dude, Busy! Seriously? You\u2019ve wasted the whole 2 months vacations lying around. She :- Oh! So I\u2019ve heard that you are leaving our school. Me :- Yup, That\u2019s true. She :- I don\u2019t even have your contact number, how will we be in touch? Inner Me :- Holy Shit, she wants to stay in touch? Me:- You can note it down. She :- Sure. The party ended and I departed ways with her for the very last time. Date :- June 4, 2013 My phone\u2019s screen flashed as I received a message. She :- Hey Divyansh, Ankita this side. Me :- Hi! Inner Me :- **Holy Shit Holy Shit** After talking for about 1.5 hours about how good our school life has been till now, she texted something different. She :- Did you find someone, as in a girlfriend? Me :- You\u2019ve known me well for the past 6 years, I won\u2019t be able to confess even if I found someone. Inner Me :- Is she asking me out? Should I tell mom I have found her Daughter-in-Law. Me :- Did you find someone? Inner Me :- Please say No! She :- Yup, do you remember Vinayak from the other section. We both are together. Me :- Yeah! Great choice girl. Inner Me :- That dumbass musician who thinks of himself as a model. Oh c\u2019mon! She :- My choice has always been great. I had a crush on you too in IX Standard. Me :- Today isn\u2019t April fools day, so are you doing this on dare? She :- Nope. I really liked you a lot. Me :-I like myself too. :p Inner Me :- Kill yourself, you idiot. She :- You\u2019re a really funny guy. Inner Me :- In other words, you can call me a joker. Me :- Thanks , But I got to go. And I sat in the corner and cried for about an hour or so. :p Regards, Divyansh Sharma ",

We had a class together last year and he said he would go to prom next year and it would be more exciting because I\u2019ll be there. I was sophomore he\u2019s a junior. Now I\u2019m a junior and he\u2019s a senior. We text about everything and he seems to enjoy texting me. I always start the convo but he keeps it going. He asks my opinion on a lot things and for help. He subtly compliments me. I think he decided to not fully dual enrollment but take classes at the school for me but I\u2019m not sure. He said he was going to fully dual enroll. I said ok and seemed kinda sad and later he told me he was taking classes at the high school. What do you guys think? ",
