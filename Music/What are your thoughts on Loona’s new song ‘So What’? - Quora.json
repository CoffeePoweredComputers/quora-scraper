            "answer_text": "Honestly\u2026it's lit! It's not the kind of thing I thought that they would do according to all the teasers and stuff but a complete different thing. And I'm not even disappointed. I like how Loona is trying to experiment with doing different concepts. It's refrehing to see them. I thought \u201cSo What\u201d would be have a similar concept to \u201cButterfly\u201d but with a more darker side. But \u201cSo What\u201d was a bit lighter? Compared to Butterfly. I mean the choreography wasn't that intense as butterfly, the scenarios according to me was less compared to Butterfly. I'm so bad at explaining it. But overall it still was awesome! As expected from the queens! It was really empowering too! For me it was like\u2026most of all just embrace the side we know and everyone else knows but to completly accept your self you should also embrace that hidden side of yourself. No one can see the hidden side of the moon but it's always there and the moon becomes fully complete together with that hidden side of it not only the light side which everyone else can see. So it's like embrace your hidden self. The past few years I've been trying to love myself and I had to embrace the hidden side of myself\u2026the one I didn't acknowledge or have any knowledge of all these years. And as I tried to embrace my hidden side I learnt new things about myself\u2026I learnt that I could do things I never thought I could do, I found new traits of me I never knew I had all along. And embracing the hidden side also showed me wounds that needed more healing. It's painful & interesting at the same time. So it's like Loona gave out the message to also embrace that hidden side of you. At the beginning of the MV they say \"Reveal To The World The Hidden Side.\" The Song also conveys the message on loving yourself & not letting society's stupid standards ruin yourself & your dreams. Most of us just do what society tells us to do. To be accepted in society we do what the society wants us to be thus we throw away our true identities to please others just to be accepted. The song conveys the message on embracing who we actually are and not what society wants us to be. The lyrics of the song also show how the society feels threatened when someone embraces their actual identities. \"Cut it out, don\u2019t be afraid\" - Don't be afraid of embracing yourself. \"Can\u2019t let it hide Burn Oh the look changed in your eyes The obstacles that were too high I\u2019ll show you going over that Further with my thrilling eyes\" - How society feels threatened when someone embraces their identities and how the individual is challenge society's ridiculous standards. \"Being sharp, So What?! Being cold, So What?! Being fearless (Bad) For what?! So What?! Take that, So What?! I\u2019m so bad, what\u2019s wrong with that? I\u2019m so bad, so what? I\u2019m so bad, be myself I\u2019m so Bad\" Anyone who accepts themselves and love themselves and tries to step out of society's standards will understand this part. The society names us bad people & rude cause we are not bowing down to what they want. This part explains that they don't care about what society labels them as. Being myself & accepting myself isn't wrong but society says it's bad but I don't care about what you say anymore, if that's what you think I am well then let it be cause I'm just accepting & loving myself. The rest of the song assures that there's nothing wrong with loving & accepting yourself so don't be afraid and just do it. It's a really empowering & a meaningful song. The only thing that's there to disappoint is the fact that Haseul wasn't able to participate in it. But she should first take care of herself before carrying on with her activities. Tho... Heejin really snapped during this comeback. I never expected her to be that badass and go out rapping! But I don't understand why people were dissapointed with it just because Loona said that they will be doing a more mainstream song. There's no harm in trying the mainstream side. I know the uniqueness would be low but they didn't say they will be doing more mainstream. The girls are already dissapointed that they couldn't give a summer comeback and to see fans going around saying they are dissapointed just because it's mainstream side would really hurt the girls. I'm just happy that Loona is together and continues to promote despite what happened in the company. ",

            "answer_text": " Prior to its release, I was actually really worried after listening to the MV teasers/Mnet spoilers, reading the track description, and hearing them say it would be more on the mainstream side. But to my surprise I actually enjoyed it but I definitely wouldn't say it's my favorite from the album.  Some things I liked: THE bridge - It was beautiful. Ms. Kimberly Lippington definitely stood out a lot in this comeback. I mean, she literally strutted around the whole time swiveling her hips like she owned the place. The scenery and visuals (as always) - Loona finally got their trip to Thailand lmao. And although it was a minor thing, I've always admired how Loona's videos always includes other ethnic groups and races because that's not seen a whole lot in Kpop.The song's message/meaning - If you can count on BBC to do one thing, it's to explain what the heck goes on in their videos because otherwise we'd be more lost than Yeojin in the woods (although they may use weird adjectives like when they called Gowon's vocals \"crunchy\" that one time) The tribute to Haseul - Putting the lore aside, I think the fact that they ended the MV with the feather was so freaking sweet and cleverly done. Now, some things I disliked: I've always been aware that basically everyone in Loona raps, but I really didn't appreciate getting attacked with verse after verse over and over again. That was disrespectful.The line distribution - I know spreading lines evenly amongst 12 (or this time 11) people isn't easy and will most likely never happen with any large group, but they did Vivi so wrong. It also makes me a little sad that during the few short seconds of screen time she did get half of her face was covered up with a piece of cloth.\"I'm so bad\" - It's without a doubt a catchy lyric but it still doesn't entirely sit well with me. I don't have a problem with rebellious concepts, but when Kpop songs include English lyrics like that I can't help but feel awkward singing it, so I don't. I think 'So What' much like the back of the moon, was definitely a new side of Loona we've never seen before. You also can clearly hear the SM influence in the song. It definitely has that flair. I thought people where lying about Lee Soo Man until I saw the end credits lol. Blockberry is clearly trying to shift things for the sake of Loona's domestic reputation. I think this time around the only thing standing in the way of Loona's 1st win is the amount of groups cramming their comebacks into the beginning of February, but I totally understand why. All in all, I think it was a decent comeback but the b-sides were definitely superior. ",
