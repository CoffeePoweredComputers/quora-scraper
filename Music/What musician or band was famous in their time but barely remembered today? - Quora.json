Here are a few that once dominated attention and have suffered terrible, unwarranted declines in public consciousness: Erroll Garner (and his trio) George Shearing Quintet Jimmy Giuffre Trio Gene Krupa and His Orchestra Billy Eckstine Shorty Rogers and His Giants Teddy Wilson Slam Stewart Booker Ervin Pete Rugolo Lee Wiley Bobby Hackett Charlie Shavers Bill Harris (trombone) Zutty Singleton Willie \u2018The Lion\u2019 Smith King Cole Trio Nat Cole (as a major pianist) I could go on, but you rockers out there are already bored to tears.

            "answer_text": "There are a couple from my childhood who were really BIG. Dave Clark 5. They had a ton of back to back hits and were close in popularity with the Beatles for a minute. Herman\u2019s Hermits. Also had a few big hits around the time of the British Invasion. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Amazing artists who made so many wonderful songs, but who have faded into the background. ",
