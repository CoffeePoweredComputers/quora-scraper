            "answer_text": "I have an idea of what I could be: The One Piece and the Poneglyphs and all like puzzle pieces. The Straw hat Pirates would need to find all the Poneglyphs, and once that is done, they will have to put these pieces together. Once it is all pieces together, it would reveal the exact location of the One Piece, except it will be a treasure map. The Straw Hat Pirates would then have to follow this map, while facing the strongest opponents in the manga.There would be one opponent for each Straw Hat Pirate, and they will fight them until the Straw Hat Pirates either win or die. After beating these opponents, the Straw Hat Pirates would finally be able to find the One Piece. This would be the main key to opening a \u201cdoor\u201d to the Poneglyphs.Using the One Piece and other Poneglyphs, they would have to fit each piece in its correct order and location, and once done, this would reveal several images of the Lost Century. Just when they thought they could get what laid inside the \u201cdoor\u201d of the Poneglyph, they realized that opening it was a grave mistake.The reason why the Naval/Imperial Army wanted to conceal the identity and location of the One Piece was to prevent more lives from being taken and having ultimate power. Inside the \u201cdoor\u201d they several coffins and caskets placed evenly that filled mostly all the space in the room. Luffy, although concerned about the coffins and the countless bones that surround the pedestal of the \u201ctreasure\u201d, his emotions and grief just to get it causes in the run up the stairs to see the concealed treasure. He throws off the covers, and sees it is a more decorated and bigger coffin than the rest.While Luffy is doing this, his friends/crew are busy arguing what the consequences could be. All of them suddenly turn around when they hear the lid of the coffin fall. This causes a shockwave to happen, causing the room to shake for a few seconds. Luffy, being extremely exhausted, bents over the see what lies in the coffin. Luffy immediately regretted his decision. He saw the most ugliest and hideous \u201cthing\u201d humanity would ever see. Luffy, now feeling queasy and afraid, suddenly barfs on the \u201cthing\u201d. Luffy then runs back at full sprint, covering his mouth to prevent him from barfing anymore.Luffy then feels lots of regret and grief, thinks back to the time he was 10 or so, believing the One Piece would be worth finding. He wishes deeply that he could turn back time so that he wouldn\u2019t have the ambition and goal of finding The One Piece. The crew then follow Luffy to go back to the ship. When they get back to their ship and sailing away from the island, they see all the coffins/caskets start shaking, and at the same time, a hideous and ugly hand pop out of each one. The \u201cthing\u201d then rises, and orders the other \u201cthings\u201d to break out and chase after the intruders so they would die so that the secret of the \u201cOne Piece\u201d would still be unknown.Nami then looks down, and see Luffy shaking rapidly and crying. Nami then asking why Luffy is doing this. He then slowly turns his head to her (in a creeepy way), and then says looking and finding The One Piece was a waste and time, effort and their sweat, blood, and tears were for nothing, and that the image of the \u201cthing\u201d would never come out of his head. Nami starts to cry, along with the rest of the crew.Chopper then turns around and turns back to the crew saying the \u201cthings were swimming towards them and coming in fast. Robin, although crying, is thinking deeply and suddenly opens her eyes. She gets up, and says that they can\u2019t fight the \u201cthings\u201d. Frankly and Usopp then yell at her as hard as they could, saying they need to fight off those \u201cthings\u201d in order to survive.Robin, crying a little bit harder now, pauses, and then says that if they touch the \u201cthings\u201d, they would turn into them (The \u201cthing\u2019s\u201d victim [the person who touched it], would suddenly fall to their knees, and letting out a painful and loud scream, and he/she would keep screaming all while their skin, eyes, hair and clothes would be melting and immediately forget all their memories and thoughts they had during their lifetime.Usually, when a person dies, they would leave their body, and become a soul, but when touching a \u201cthing\u201d the victim\u2019s soul would painfully melt and deep into their flesh. After this is all over, with the victim\u2019s brain turned to mush, they would attack the invaders until all of them became \u201cthings\u201d. The rest of the crew, having stopped crying, are now staring at her with their mouths open.Then Usopp, having gained enough courage to say something after hearing, says how are they going to escape. Robin, pauses again, closes her eyes, and leans her head down. After a few seconds, she then opened her eyes, and says the must accept their fate and become a \u201cthing.\u201d After saying this, a \u2018\u201cthing\u201d grabs her by the waist, soon followed with another pulling her hair, and two more pulling her legs. The \u201cthings\u201d start dragging her off the boat, while scratching and biting into her flesh.She then screams, and looks at the crew, and screams at them to help her. Instead of helping, they just stare at her with blank expressions on their faces, trying to process and absorb what is happening. The crew sees her flesh start to melt, they last thing they see is her hand.The screen goes dark. The audience then sees the dark/black-haired girl in her bed, and suddenly open her eyes and rise in to a sitting position. Robin then quickly looks at her surroundings, then breathed a sigh a relief, realizing it was just a dream.Then she suddenly realizes what she just dreamed was real, except while Robin was sleeping the other members of the crew was suffering instead. She quickly get out of bed and opens the door, and then realizes she was just hallucinating. (To Be Continued\u2026)",

            "answer_text": "One Piece, according to me will be sort of different from what the previous answers seem to suggest. Gold Roger could simply be called so to lull the rumors about the Will of D and the family of D. And he never mentions that his treasure was gold. Remember that Woonan had acquired a third of the world's treasure and hidden it. No one is aiming for that treasure. They are all aiming for One Piece. The one piece is supposed to hidden on the island at the far end of the Grand line, which can be reached only after traversing through the New World (as far as pirates are concerned). But, the navy has already found a way to get there using the calm belt. So, it cannot be a massive weapon in itself. The navy would long since have taken possession of it had this been so. Now, it could be a weapon of mass destruction like Neptune or Pluto as mentioned before. But that is somewhat unlikely. What is likely is it be a method making the third weapon. Which I am assuming will be called Jupiter (Pluton, Neptune and Jupiter are brothers and sons of Saturn). It will most likely be a weapon which works on domination over destruction as Jupiter, and Haou, all point towards a dominating king over a destroying tyrant. So, I believe that the One Piece would be a sort of method to make Jupiter (Methods to make Pluto and Neptune have already been shown and gotten rid of, so this has to be it). Following the pattern of Pluto being a warship, then Neptune being a fish-princess, it is likely that One Piece would basically make the Pirate King (The one who found it) the literal King of the Seas. With an ability to control everyone in the seas. And to be able to attack every island easily from the seas. (Using abilities of Neptune and Pluton) This information could come as the link between all the Poneglyphs or as a single book showing the entire method. ",

            "answer_text": "What Is One Piece? What I really want to talk about is the One Piece. There are tonnes of theories out there about the One Piece, and I think some of them are extremely interesting. According to this theory, the One Piece is actually a plan to unite all four seasons into one ocean. This plan was created about 900 years ago, and it was ebbed on the Poneglyphs. However, since the 20 Kings opposed the Ancient Kingdom, the plan didn\u2019t succeed. After the defeat of the Ancient Kingdom, they decided to inscribe it into the Poneglyphs. On the other hand, the World Government was created and they began to rule the entire World. Centuries later, Roger found it, but he lacked the power to bring about this change because of his disease. So instead, he started the Great Age of Pirates. To be able to carry out this plan, the Ancient Weapons, called Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus, were created. This also ties down to the Destruction of the Fishman Island. Joy Boy promised that once the Red Line was destroyed, the Fishman would be moved out of there with the help of Noah. With the destruction of the Red Line, and of course, the Reverse Mountain, all the 4 seas would unite, and the world would become \u2018one\u2019 again. Of course, this also ties along with the concept of the All Blue. The One Piece is the All Blue. Luffy is now the person who has inherited all the weight of the ancestors, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll see him become the first person to pull it off. I personally like the theory, and even if it turns out to be wrong, I find the idea behind it quite intriguing. I\u2019m sure some of you will have liked it as well.

            "answer_text": "First of all, this is just my opinion, in other words this is what II personally would like to see, not what I think it might be. Please keep an open mind reading my theory. Lne Piece is without a doubt a treasure, means its precious. Oda also stated that it won't be lame like the journey itself is One Piece, which I personally think its cliche but not that lame since the journey is what keeps me engage through out this past 12+ years. These days, I don't even care what One Piece actually is. I just enjoying the story. That being said, doesnt mean I dont have any theory at all. My theory is this. One Piece is something from Void Century that will give clarity on every single mysteries. However, it comes with price, that if this One Piece see the world, it will change it beyond imagination. It might even brings catasthrope for the world population. Thats why Rayleigh said to Luffy that Roger crew were to hasty and Luffy crew might arrive with different answer from them. Roger crew decides that the world is not ready yet, and if they release this One Piece into the world it will plunge into chaos without a doubt. But Luffy crews journey is different. In certain aspect, you could even see that by destroying CORRUPT POWER after the public (on that arc) realize that they being controlled is the same way of preparing them to accept the chaos that One Piece might bring. Dressrosa arc is a good reference for my opinion, since it really serve as miniature of One Piece world situation right now. The public is happy with the freedom brought by land of destruction after massive battle since they realize their own ignorance first. As for what the object is, my best guess is a Gold Key. This key wpuld be used to unlock everything that WG locked away, including ancient civilization, ancient treasure, and ancient memories. Where is One Piece located? Raftel / Laugh Tale. Where is it? I believe between fisherman island and Mariejoa. Why? well basically two of retiring roger crew are living near that place. Crocus living inside Laboon near one of the exit of Reverse Mountain and Rayleigh lives on Sabaody Archipelago. Now, Rayleigh job as ship coater (allowing ship to become submarine) gives me an idea. What if, Rayleigh intentionally become coat engineer to help the dream alive, that someday someone will found its way to One piece. Thats it! Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Spoilers Ahead: If anyone's talking about treasure then 1st thing coming to mind will be Gold. In this case Onepiece will also most probably Gold because \"Gol D. Roger\" was not simply called as \"Gold Roger\" because they mistook his name. Also He was the one created Pirate age. Not so easy to lure people to become Pirates without any kind of Gold or Something valuable in it. But there's also probability that Onepiece may be a weapon (Probably one of the three Ancient Weapons they mentioned). For this to be true Gol D. Roger should have lied about that telling it was a treasure so that everyone will go find it and also this means He wants someone to find the weapon and use it. Also If Onepiece is really about Gold then what's the problem with Government in someone finding it? Why are they so much obsessed If some big shot tells \"Onpiece Exists\" ? So it's definitely not about Gold alone. Something more. Up until now from the story released all we can predict is that it is a Weapon that can destroy anything most probably. Maybe that's why Government doesn't want anyone to find it. If in case that's what it is then Why not Government itself find it and use it against Pirates? It's because may be they fear that it may fall in wrong hands and will be used for destruction or That weapon has only one use which favors only Pirates.  Also our Hero Monkey D. Luffy's g aim is to be Pirate King ( Man who has Most Freedom ). To justify that the weapon we are talking will help Luffy gain that Freedom he wants. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe I can help to figure this out. I believe Gold D Roger already had the Once Piece before he arrived to Raftel. Roger hid the One Piece on Raftel because he knew only a new pirate king could arrive to Raftel. Several former members have already claimed they have been waiting for someone. That someone is a new pirate king that can use the One Piece for good. I believe Luffy will reach Raftel after he becomes Pirate King. Then he will use the One Piece to help his father. The final outcome will be the end of the rule of the Tenryuubito and a new world government. I also don\u2019t believe Oda will destroy the Marines. He haven\u2019t portray the Marines as the bad guys. So, my quest the One Piece will be something that Luffy can use to get his friends on the Marine to support the end of the rule of the Tenryuubito. In the end, Coby and Smoker will become Admirals. This would actually make sense versus some weapon destroying the Marines and leaving Coby crying in anger against Luffy. So, I believe for that to happen the One Piece is simply an object that will prove to everyone everything that happened 900 years ago and Coby and Smoker will determine they are better helping Luffy and Dragon.

It's this giant egg, and a lot of people are coming up with theories about it. I have become suspicious of this egg, and have not dropped the possibility that it could be the One Piece, or what is inside it could be the One Piece. I do not have any solid evidence. It could also be an ancient weapon. Some people have theorized that it is a dragon egg. It could also be a lead, or a clue to find out what the One Piece treasure is. Until further notice, I will have this egg on my list of potential One Piece treasures. ",

The Rio Poniglyph will also be on Raftel, and the Rio Ponyglyph contains the lost knowledge of the Void Century. This will be the greatest treasure as everyone will have knowledge of what exactly happened 800 years before the present of the series. It is imporant to note that early on in the series, Oda may have planned that the journey will be the entire treasue due to a weird chapter in the East Blue saga. We meet a man stuck in a chest called Gaimon, and he waited 20 years for someone to climb attop a cliff only to find put that there was no gold in the chests. Instead his treasure was the quirky animals that he befriended while stranded on the island. While I don\u2019t think this is what Oda has in store for us now, as a lot of time has passed and the build up to the One Piece has become so much greater than before, that there will be lots of gold.

There have been theories and the most plausible one is that one piece is actually a goal to unite all four seas and turn it into one, aka all blue. This means to destroy red line that blocks the seas and let all the sea flow into one big sea. The other less popular theory that most people thought very early on in the series is the fulfillment and adventure of going through everything as a crew when u finish new world. ",

This is a clear indication that One piece is connected with the poneglyphs. There is a huge chance that the greatest weapon( like Poseidon) will be there and also the true history will be revealed.

Maybe people should perhaps think about the possibility that One Piece is also just a piece of something bigger and broader than we are thinking of. Ex: The name of the Anime, One Piece, is also plausible to the entire Anime series, as each episode and manga is crucial to the development of the story and each one is only a single piece of the entire picture/story/anime. One should ask what One Piece is a piece/part of. Perhaps that may uncover clues. ",
