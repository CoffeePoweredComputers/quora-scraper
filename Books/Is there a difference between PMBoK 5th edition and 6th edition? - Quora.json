            "answer_text": "I love PMBOK and hence track it really closely. If you consider changes from processes perspective then they are not much different, but if you consider from approach perspective then lots of mindset changes can be tracked to accommodate recent developments in overall field of management. Few important are: Introduction of Agile methodology: It becomes important as we are moving from \u201cproven traditional\u201d works to \u201csomething new\u201d works. It add to uncertainty which does not work well for waterfall method. So instead of putting long term detailed planning, it is being advised to make it smaller and progress as you explore along the way.Inclusion of recent market changes: With the changing work scenario, PMBOK has managed to include many situations in its content, which keeps it up to date.Resources are broken in to two parts: Human resources are now called project team and other resources are called resources like material, machine, equipments, etc.There are many such changes which makes it relevant. To simplify entire book I would recommend you to find a book on Amazon (search for B07BJBNF74) to quickly learn entire concept of PMBOK 6th edition in shortest possible time. All the best! Ashok ",
