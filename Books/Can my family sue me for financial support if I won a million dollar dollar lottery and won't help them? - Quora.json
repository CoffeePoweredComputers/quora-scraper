            "answer_text": "Can my family sue me for financial support if I won a million dollar dollar lottery and won't help them? Sure. In the US, anyone can sue anyone for anything. IF a judge even agrees to hear this case, all your family will have to do is produce a copy of the document you signed after you turned 18, agreeing that should you ever win a million dollar lottery, you will provide financial support for your family. When the judge sees that, he\u2019ll have no choice but to rule in their favor. ",
