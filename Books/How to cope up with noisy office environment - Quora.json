            "answer_text": "Noisy offices can be annoying, at least you aren\u2019t damaging your hearing; you will probably only begin to lose your hearing after 8 hrs+ exposure to over 85 dBA (Busy city traffic), or for 15 seconds over 115 dBA (Putting your head next to a leaf blower). Generally offices and even call centers won\u2019t get up to those levels, however there are other risks associated with prolonged exposure to constant noise levels above 65 dBA including stress, hypertension, headaches, immune system troubles, and they can be an overall nuisance. 65 dBA is also what most busy offices average on a good day; and other than the additional mental stress, noise levels above 55 dBA according to the German Association of Engineers is not optimal for work that requires critical thinking. Noisy offices are often hard to avoid; many people need to speak as part of their job function. The best methods to reduce the noisy office environment, if you can\u2019t get everyone else to keep quieter, are environmental acoustic dampening solutions. One place you could start looking for acoustic solutions is here: https://callimprovement.center Keep in mind though, acoustics aren\u2019t so simple, just placing an acoustic foam mat on your desk might not make a difference, so it\u2019s best to use multiple acoustic solutions in your environment such as wall panels, hanging acoustic dampeners, foam in strategic locations and desk and desk section dividers. You could also use personal noise mitigating products: noise cancelling headphones, noise masking systems either on your desk on in the ceiling to mitigate the distracting influence of nearby conversations. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Good question, organizations tend to underestimate this distraction, particularly if there are extroverts in management. Here\u2019s my approach: Noise cancelling headphones. They don\u2019t eliminate voice, but will eliminate constant noise like fans, heaters, etc. They will reduce voice.Ear plugs, not only to they block out sound, but they visually prevent more interruptions. Orient yourself so you can see people directly or through peripheral vision. Only if someone really needs something will they tap on the shoulders.Working in a meeting room, or other area away from the noise.For the company I work for I implemented \u201cfocus flags\u201d, little desk flags the engineers can put up if they absolutely have to get something done. This doesn\u2019t prevent noise, but it prevents interruptions.",
