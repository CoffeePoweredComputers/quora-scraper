            "answer_text": "You should really check out AoPS (Art of Problem Solving). This is one of the best ways to prepare for any type of math olympiad and they have arguably one of the best book curriculum ever. I would highly recommend AoPS books as these are top notch math competition preparations (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 would be a good place to start). If you complete these books, you'll be on your way to math competitions. I would also recommend AoPS classes online (even though you are kind of old for them); these classes are almost as good as their books and complement AoPS books really well. You get help from a lot of other people and teachers also. ",
