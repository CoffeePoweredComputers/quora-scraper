            "answer_text": "Hey, Joaquin. Thanks for your question. Let us take a closer look at it. \u201c\u2018I look forward to meeting you too\u2019, does this statement make sense?\u201d The short answer is \u2018yes\u2019. It is grammatically correct, but there are a few other ways of saying the same thing and mean it.` \u2018Look forward to meeting you too\u2019 sounds rather archaic and has become really meaningless. When you want to say something meaningful in the same sense, you need to be original and honest. Does it mean anything to you when somebody says, \u2018Look forward to meeting you too\u2019? What is he saying? What do you understand by such a remark? I truly believe you don\u2019t believe the respondent any way. The \u2018too\u2019 suggests that you say \u2018Look forward to meeting you too\u2019 as a response to a remark of some sort. Furthermore, the suggestion of seeing you too implies that the other person said as a goodbye gesture that he would like to see you again. What now? As I\u2019ve said: be honest and original. Don\u2019t copy an archaic expression thought up in the previous century by someone who thought it to be cute. First of all, be honest. Say what you really want to say in such a manner that the recipient of the response recognises it to be honest. Keep on doing that, it becomes a habit. In saying goodbye e.g., say what is in your heart. If you don\u2019t want to see that person again, don\u2019t lie. Don\u2019t be hearty. Say: \u201cI did not expect to see you again. It was quite a surprise.\u201d Full stop. Don\u2019t say you would love to see him again. Rather say: \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll bump into each other again someday.\u201d Full stop. Do not, under any circumstance repeat a greeting you have heard somewhere else. Be original. Think about your responses. Think of what you would like to say to this other person. \u201cI have enjoyed listening to what you have been up to since we last saw each other\u2019 or \u201cI loved telling you about my new girlfriend. I hope you\u2019ll meet her some or other time. I would like your opinion of her because I admire your taste in women.\u201d Full stop. Shake hands and walk away. Or you could say: \u2018Look forward to seeing you too\u2019.\u201d Depending on whether you want to see that other person again, you should construct your response. If not, don't respond in a way that you would like to see that person again. Be honest, but polite: maybe something like: \u201cFancy running into you. I had no idea you were still around.\u201d Shake hands and walk away. If you would like to see that person again, say so. \u201cYes, I\u2019d like that. I enjoyed chatting with you. We should catch up again.\u201d Shake hands and go home. A greeting or a response to it is a reflection on you and someone who is sharper than you may think, will see through you and evaluate you on what leaves your mouth. That, my friend, is my coin in the purse. Kind regards. Bye. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes..makes sense due to its well known meaning. Especially when you end with \u201ctoo\u201d indicating they said that already (and why would you invent something new to say? Or maybe just \u201cMe too!\u201d? Or \u201cyes, finally!\u201d?). But otherwise it's a rather silly saying as\u2026 Look? Noone can see into future. \u201cI joyfully anticipate to see you then\u201d would be better.Can't really see the purpose. You feel an urge to convince them beforehand that all will be fine and you wont scream \u201ci don't like that you forced me to come here\u201d, stay silent or just be an ass when you meet?This is just another of those really content-less phrases we humans like to repeat to help starting, upholding or ending a social interaction. Like the infamous USA automatic phrase pair \u201cHow are you? Fine/great. And you?\u201d eventhough a family member just died... Yes, let's continue with these phrases. There is always some contents in subsequent messages. Well, mostly\u2026. ",
