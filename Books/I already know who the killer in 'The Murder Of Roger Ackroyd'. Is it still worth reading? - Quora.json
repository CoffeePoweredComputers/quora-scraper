            "answer_text": "First things first, if you have found it out yourself. Congrats you have missed the greatest twist in one of the finest crime detectives of the twentieth century whose story telling and plot development has inspired many Hollywood movies and detective novels to follow on the same line as hers. The ending was unique since it had never been done before and after the murderer gets revealed ,you feel like reading the entire book again because it will be too hard to swallow. Secondly, if someone has spoiled it for you, severe all kind of ties with him/her. If possible express your frustration physically or better read other Agatha Christie whodunits and spoil it for them. Now coming back to your question , yes it is still worth reading a multiple times. Now that you have come to know who the murderer is you can appreciate the beauty of the writing style of Christie\u2019s. How the person has hidden himself in his very words and how carefully the evil plan of his is laid where the person uses ambiguous words like \u201cI hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering if there was anything I had left undone\u201d and ominous sentences like \u201c 'I did what little had to be done!\u201d. Also you can pay more attention to the details of his scheme during the phone call , selection of the Tunisian Dagger(the murder weapon), the placement of the dictaphone,his meeting with Captain Ralph Paton,etc. There are several places where the person has lied, offered Red Herrings to Poirot and you will find it again and you will find the irony when the person pleads to Flora Ackroyd not to involve Poirot in the case, since the truth will be too hard to digest. Enjoy reading and appreciate the genius of the greatest crime writer- Agatha Christie. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you look for in a mystery. If the only reason you enjoy a mystery is the shock of finding out \u2018whodunnit\u2019, then no, you shouldn\u2019t bother reading one if you already know who the killer is. If you read it as an intellectual puzzle - as a challenge in putting together the clues correctly - then knowing the killer beforehand takes away that challenge, but, in case of a brilliant writer like Christie, it provides a slightly different intellectual thrill: that of seeing how the author sets up the clues and then uses misdirection to send the characters and the readers chasing after red herrings. The above is regarding mystery novels in general. The following is my personal opinion regarding The Murder of Roger Ackroyd in particular: I\u2019ve read it twice, so obviously I already knew the killer the second time around. I loved it the first time around - it was one of my favourites among Christie\u2019s books (I\u2019ve read them all). But the second time around, it wasn\u2019t quite as much fun - mostly because the book is too reliant on that one twist regarding the killer\u2019s identity in the end. The rest of the story is \u2026 not bad, by any means, but not really Christie\u2019s best work. There are other novels by her that you can read over and over again, such as Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None, which remain just as entertaining even after knowing who the killer is, but, IMO, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is not one such book. Nonetheless, there\u2019s no harm in giving the book a shot. What do you have to lose? ",
