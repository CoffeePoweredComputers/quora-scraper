            "answer_text": "Benjamin Graham\u2019s book is the Bible. To understand it may take some supplemental studying as well. Understanding it is the key to deciphering a companies value. If you can do that to some degree, then start looking(or do both together as a study exercise) for a company that is an area you have a major interest in. Don\u2019t look for a heavy industry if you are interested in agricultural. Agriculture has numerous areas to invest and you would study those heavier. When you do invest, invest in owning a company, not in a stock. If you wish to invest, you are long term and expect to hold the stock for a long time. If you wish to follow current trends, that is day trading to some degree and it is not investing, it is more of a fast paced action that reacts to current events. Such as covid. Long term, people eat, sleep, and do things. They always will and companies will always exist to serve them. Investing involves determining which companies do it best and plan for the future the best. I won\u2019t claim credit for this philosophy, it is just derived from Warren Buffett and his philosophy that you can view in a variety of areas if you wish. When you\u2019ve seen all the YouTube videos with him for the last year or so, it can refine your approach to investing. Use it as a foundation and you can succeed nicely, although he suggests index funds for the investor that is unwilling to put the effort into studying the basics. ",
