            "answer_text": "The latest conspiracy theories that Trump has been spouting have come directly from his old White House advisor, Steve Bannon, now living in France. Through his Breitbart friends, he\u2019s fed a cacophony of chatter and disinformation. What we\u2019re watching is a classic Russian tactic of disinformation or information chaos. Putin could not be happier. Giuliani has worked to repeat this conspiracy chaos in Trump\u2019s ear and whip up Trump\u2019s fury. Trump is easily diverted from any focus he manages to muster on any issue. Besides being an extreme narcissist, he seems to have ADHD as well. Keep in mind that undermining Mueller\u2019s investigation results works to favor Russia/Putin. Sowing seeds to place the 2016 election interference happening in the Ukraine rather than Russia as supported by Mueller\u2019s investigation, favors Ukraine\u2019s enemy, Russia/Putin. Blaming the Bidens for their business ties in the Ukraine is the height of hypocrisy. Trump and his family have unlimited business dealings in MANY foreign countries, Ivanka receiving countless Chinese patents while her father was POTUS. ",
