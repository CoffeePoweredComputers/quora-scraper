            "answer_text": "Begin by going through the syllabus. Sort out your strong and weak points. Work on them accordingly. If you feel you\u2019re prepared enough, attempt previous year questions from books by Silver Zone Foundation. If you can attempt most of them, then you\u2019re done. Remember to engage in effective time management while going through the syllabus. If you\u2019re looking to acquire this book (or others) for free, you may check out this website called MyPustak. You just have to pay shipping charges. I wish you all the best for your preparation.  ",
