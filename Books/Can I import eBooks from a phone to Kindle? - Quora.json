            "answer_text": "Yes. There are two ways that I know. 1. You must be having a kindle account. Just mail your ebook (pdf format) to that id (it should be like: xyz.kindle.com). The mail should have the subject: \"convert\" and attach you ebook to it.  Soon you will receive a mail with a file in kindle format (on your registered id) and thereafter you can just download the book using a wifi connection on your kindle. 2. Use a pc. Download the book directly from the mail you received and transfer it to the Document folder of your kindle. Happy reading! ",
