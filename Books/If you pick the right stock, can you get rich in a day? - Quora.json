If you even think of penny stocks, no rides for you! Real time example: Tesla popped 8\u201310% ish yesterday. If you had a billion invested, thats an easy $100M right? Buffet has made some serious loop with Apple . Same thing. It\u2019s quite lame actually and they don\u2019t flinch. Nothing like watching your portfolio go up and down. A couple of million here, a couple of million there in both directions. For these gods, its billions up or down. The little guys like me delete the stock app when it gets old, so not sure what the big shots do. Maybe golf? Can you get rich by picking the right stock? Yes, but you have to be rich to begin with. Not going into options, but you get the idea. For now, focus on getting rich. I share a few secrets on this from Silicon Valley if you know where to look. If you end up becoming the next George Soros who made a billion in a day, half is mine. Deal? Good looking out bruh! See You On The Road! Rogue Uber Driver ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible to get rich in a day, however it is very highly unlikely. By trading and investing in big, blue chip, large cap stocks and even mid cap stocks this will be virtually impossible. The only way you could pull this off would be by trading penny stocks on the OTC markets, you can find a stock on the OTC markets for less than a penny! you can buy 200,000 shares for only $50. If you were to invest in a company like that and the next day it had a significant price increase, you could become rich in a day. DO NOT JUST GO OUT AND BUY RANDOM STOCKS ON THE OTC MARKET!!! YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY!!! it takes a lot of learning and experience in order to trade penny stocks, you also need money you are willing to lose in case the stock falls tremendously, which happens everyday to thousands of stocks on the OTC market. Just to recap, you CAN get rich in a single day but not by trading the big safe reliable companies. You have to trade the very very small companies which are super volatile and can drop to nothing in the matter of seconds. I suggest you stick to the longer term of the stock market, its much safer.
