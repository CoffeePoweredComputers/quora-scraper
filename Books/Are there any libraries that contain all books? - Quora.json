Give you an idea of the scope - in the US alone, almost 1,000,000 books are published annually (that figure includes academic titles, self-published, etc.). If that figure holds true since the year 2000, we\u2019ve already seen 17,000,000 books published in the US. The Library of Congress, which has been around for about 200 years, has approximately 167 million items on over 800 miles of shelves - and that\u2019s not even close to everything in existence! ",

If one publishes a book in the United States, the Library of Congress controls giving out copyright. Part of that procedure is having a copy of the book at the Library of Congress. But that would just be US, not any other countries ",
