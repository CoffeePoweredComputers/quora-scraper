            "answer_text": "I hope I don\u2019t come off as cranky as I answer \u201cI'm currently writing a romantic fantasy novel, but I've been having some trouble coming up with a good hook. Can anyone help?\u201d because I may simply be misinterpreting the question. If so, I apologize. My aim is to help. The person asking the question seems to not understand what a hook is and how it works. It\u2019s really, really difficult for a bunch of strangers to come up with suggestions for opening hooks when they don\u2019t know anything about the premise beyond the genre. And, should the person asking the question provide the premise, the opening hook, I would think, would be an essential part of it. I guess it seems to me that this is a lot like \u2018I want to bake some cookies. Where do I start?\u201d to which we\u2019d all respond, um, what kind of cookies? \u201cChocolate chip.\u201d Well, do you have all the ingredients? \u2026 Your opening hook should relate in a natural way to your premise, and should reflect the overall tone and voice of your book. It doesn\u2019t have to, strictly, but if you intend the characters to be chatty and funny, and your opening hook is formal and serious, then there\u2019s the potential for readers that love the opening to dislike the rest of the book, and likewise there\u2019s the potential for readers that love chatty and funny books to skip your book entirely because the first chapter, being formal and serious, is not their sort of thing. That\u2019s the \u2018promise\u2019 of an opening: to give the readers an idea of what kind of experience they\u2019re going to have. Setting up voice and tone should be an ingredient of your opening. In fantasy stories, the openings should give the reader some idea of what sort of fantasy it is. You say romantic. So, what kind of romance are we talking about? Star-crossed lovers? The bantering kind that never get together? An established couple (or trio, or quad\u2026?) Will there be a lover\u2019s triangle? Your opening hook will hint at that. Will there be tragedy? Your opening hook can set that up by showing a character flaw that will lead to that tragedy. Will there be a happily ever after? Your opening can show a character under stress that deserves a happily ever after, but that HEA is far away, or maybe even (under the current circumstances) impossible. Setting up the kind of character that readers can fall in love with makes it more believable that your other character(s) might fall in love with that character too. But we don\u2019t want a happy happy joy joy opening. There\u2019s nothing at stake if everything is grand and wonderful. So invent an interesting problem. It may not have anything to do with the main plot, but it should suggest the kind of problems we may see in the main plot. Will there be dragons central to the plot? Maybe the the opening can be about dragons directly or indirectly: a dragon festival gone wrong, an anniversary to a dragon-related death, the character buying a new flagon and finding the dragon symbol on it in poor taste because dragons are so awful and mean, or whatever. Will there be magic? Then bring in the magic. Will there be a quest to a distant, perhaps semi-mythical land? Show us (the readers) the limits of what is known and unknown in your character\u2019s world, and show us the character straining at those limitations as they confine him or her. And what about the character\u2019s internal life? An opening can (and perhaps should) show us where a character\u2019s emotional needs aren\u2019t being met. One of the reasons that the clich\u00e9 meeting in a tavern doesn\u2019t often work is because the tavern doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with anything the whole rest of the story. The characters rarely if ever go drinking again, they don\u2019t know anyone there, they don\u2019t have any conflicts at or with the tavern, etc. The tavern literally has nothing to do with anything except as a convenient place where people sometimes meet and talk, but usually just ogle each other or mind their own business until something interesting comes along. That\u2019s not pro-active. The character isn\u2019t being a protagonist if they\u2019re just sitting on their butts when something happens. I suggest that you have your character(s) struggle with something in the opening. Then, from there, you can set them up for the real conflict around which your main plot revolves. For more info about opening hooks, I suggest that you read Writing Active Hooks Book 1: Action, Emotion, Surprise and More - Kindle edition by Mary Buckham. Reference Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. She does a solid job of explaining how to develop an opening hook, and how to continue to hook readers so that they keep turning pages. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The hook is a reference to the end of the plot, generally to the last chapter. If you don't have a clear picture of how the book ends, it's impossible to come up with a hook. The hook is placed usually somewhere in the first chapter. It's purpose is to tell the reader what the main character hope's to accomplish. Examples of hooks: This thing looks like a treasure map.; Unless I can get $10000 by next Thursday, Momma's gonna lose the house. ; Your mission, Mr. Bond, is to\u2026 : Look at his neck. Two holes. I told you there's a vampire in Middleton! ",
