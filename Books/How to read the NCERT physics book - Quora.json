So that during the lecture your brain start more involving in that topic , it start to recognise that yes this is what I have read today is complete true and I understand it and also sometimes the topics which are not understood while reading self , so during the lecture you think that yes this topic are not understood during Reading , so you pay more attention to understand it and so you have revised your book two times .
