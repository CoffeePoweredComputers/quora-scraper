            "answer_text": "Familiarizing Yourself If you haven't read many graphic novels, start by reading more of them. Get a sense of the rhythm of them and how they work. Watchmen - Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons (the classic reimagining of superheroes)Jimmy Corrigan - Chris Ware (a literary masterwork with excellent artwork)Maus - Art Spiegelman (a sophisticated look at the Holocaust)Bone - Jeff Smith (a silly and adventurous epic)Also, check out some excellent non-fiction books on the topic: Understanding Comics and Making Comics - Scott McCloudComics and Sequential Art - Will EisnerDrawing Words and Writing Pictures and Mastering Comics - Matt Madden and Jessica AbelWords for Pictures - Brian Michael Bendis The Team You need at least one person to create a graphic novel, but that person must be capable of both writing and drawing. If you can't do both, you'll need to hire someone else to draw, and depending on the requirements of the project, there may need to be others. Most artists should be capable of doing penciling, inking, coloring, and lettering, but if time is a critical factor then additional people may need to take over some of those tasks. The Process Once you've assembled your team, some experimentation will be in order to determine the best working method. There's no single way to do this; some writers give the artists detailed specifications, others leave many things up to the artist. Some writers are unapproachable, others collaborate with the team. You'll have to try different approaches to find out what works best for your team. I'd suggest a fairly collaborative approach to begin with. The Script Again, there's no single way to write comics scripts. In short, you'll need to write a story that can be broken down into visual language and dialogue. Remember to let pictures carry the weight of the story when possible. Don't call for too many things to happen in each panel. Getting Started Begin by writing a synopsis of your story, then slowly flesh it out into a complete storyline and script. As it begins to take form, you will have something that you can show to potential collaborators. Since you've never done this before, you'll want something impressive to convince people you have what it takes.  Finally, if you can draw at all, at least try to draw it yourself. It will give you a better understanding of how the medium works, and improve your ability to write for it. You may even find you prefer to work solo, as many people do. ",
