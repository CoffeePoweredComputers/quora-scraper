I recommend Self-Publishing, Book Printing & Distribution Company for eBook conversion and they will design a cover for a small fee. You will need your own ISBN (only one) Amazon Kindle doesn\u2019t use the standard ISBN. They use their own ID #. ",

I take for granted a lot of the underlying technology. Your mileage may vary. But to write something that\u2019s worth publishing, that\u2019s the hard part. Full stop. Anybody can publish. 90% of those who do really shouldn\u2019t. ",
