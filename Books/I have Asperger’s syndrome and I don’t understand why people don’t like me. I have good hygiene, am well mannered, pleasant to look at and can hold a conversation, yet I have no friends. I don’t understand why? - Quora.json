            "answer_text": "Have you ever met someone who seems like a perfectly nice, normal person, but there is just something OFF about them? You cant put your finger on it, but they just set off alarms inside you that tell you to get away from them. Most of the time people like this turn out to be liars, users or backstabbers. One girl I met and had this reaction to, went on to kill someone years later! Another was a thief and liar, for example. Humans don\u2019t have such acute instincts as animals, but we still have them, and one or more of those instincts help us recognise people we do, or do not, want around us. They also help us \u2018recognise our own kind\u2019, those we feel a connection or liking for. People with ASD can trigger a false alarm in neurotypical people, as they sense we are not like them, but we look perfectly normal, so they do not understand why. As a person with ASD, there will be social cues that you miss and social taboo's you break, simply because you didn\u2019t even realise they were there. You may display unusual body language or eye contact, get fixated on things you enjoy and talk about them excessively. Or any number of other little behaviours that are common and normal in someone with ASD, but appear abnormal to neurotypicals. There may be a hundred tiny things you do or say, that you don\u2019t even notice, but which others do. Unfortunately, this \u2018different way of seeing and interacting with the world and it\u2019s people\u2019, sets off those aversion instincts in others, and makes them aware, either consciously or subconsciously, that you are different. And people have a deep, instinctively suspicious reaction to that which is different. For example, I started a new school at 7 years old, and EVERY kid in my class, had me pegged as \u2018different and weird\u2019 before the end of the first day. They could just tell. I doubt any of them could have explained WHY they didn\u2019t like me, they just knew/felt that they didn\u2019t. At that young age children do not have fully developed logic or reasoning centres in their brains. But they do have good instincts, and they know when someone is not like them. As adults, we have learned to somewhat counter our instinctive reactions to \u2018different\u2019 things and people, with what we learn through our lives, about tolerance and equality, as well as what our own logic tells us. But those instincts never fully go away. Like you, I was raised to be polite and quiet, was well groomed and could hold adequate conversations on things that interested me. BUT looking back on my childhood/teens/twenties now, I can see some of the things I wasn\u2019t quite \u2018getting\u2019 back then. Such as personal space, I tended to be right in someones face if I was excited, and standing too far back when bored. But to the neurotypical this simply looks like rude and standoffish behaviour. I often forgot to say please and thank you when I was excited, unintentionally, but it took me a long time to train myself to say it, without reminding myself, in situations that demanded it. I had a tendency to get lost in my own head and randomly zone out, also considered rude as well as \u2018odd\u2019. I was picky about food, so was rarely able to eat at others houses, which was also considered rude and friends seemed to believe I was \u2018making up excuses\u2019. Like many with ASD, I am extremely honest most of the time. I considered honesty, even if painful to me, to be the only acceptable answer, but neurotypicals expect the answer they WANT, not the truth, so I only upset people when they asked me questions. I was good at figuring out the most efficient way to complete a project, both at school and later, in work, but because, my solutions were unconventional and \u2018not the way things are done\u2019 my ideas were never listened to. They made sense in MY mind, obvious sense, so much sense that I couldn\u2019t understand why no-one else could see it. But they can\u2019t because their brains are wired differently. Just as I overlook the \u2018obvious\u2019 neurotypical solutions to problems, they can\u2019t see the \u2018obvious\u2019 ASD solution easily either. At the end of the day, if you being yourself is putting people off, you have two options. First, you can decide that if these people can\u2019t or won\u2019t accept you as you are, they are probably not the sort of people who would make good friends in the first place, and that you are better off saving your friendship for when you finally meet someone who CAN see what a great person you are, ASD and all, and deserves your friendship. After spending years desperately trying to be \u2018normal\u2019 and fit in, so the few friends I did have wouldn\u2019t leave, only for them to leave anyway eventually, this is the way I choose to live by now. The other option is to find out what is putting people off of being your friend, and then figuring out how to minimise these traits in your personality, so they no longer cause an issue. This one is a bit tricky, because you have to look deeply at yourself and your behaviour, and find out where your actions and reactions to things are different from most peoples, then figure out how to adapt them to a more neurotypically acceptable way of thinking and reacting. If you think back over memories and situations that have not gone well, and try to imagine you are watching a stranger playing you. Be as neutral as possible as you observe and try to figure out WHY that person reacted like that. WHAT \u2018you\u2019 said that made them back off. WHY it may have made them react that way. HOW many ways could they have interpreted what you said/did, that may not have occurred to you when you said/did it?. HOW would a neurotypical person have looked/felt/reacted? If you examine your own behaviour and still can\u2019t figure out what the problems are, you have to ask others. Which means you need trustworthy people who will give you an honest assessment of what they believe may put others off being friends with you. I have done this with family members, and it is helpful, although not comfortable to hear. You may also find the things people have problems with about you, are things you like about yourself and do not wish to change. Then you have to find a balance between becoming more friend-able vs. not completely changing who you are. I always recommend the first option, because changing yourself to be \u2018more neurotypical\u2019 is like wearing a mask, is in fact called \u2018masking\u2019. You can train yourself to react more neurotypically, but it will only ever be skin deep, you will always be \u2018translating\u2019 from autism to neurotypical. It is exhausting and depressing living like that. You may make friends, but they will not be YOUR friends, they will be friends with the mask you are wearing. In my opinion it is better to be alone, than be around people you know wont like the real you. However, it also possible to find a balance between toning down the most annoying ASD traits while still staying yourself. I recommend you research autism traits, read forums, websites and quora questions about the traits others have, and how they manage them. Try to understand which ones you have, you may find many little things you had not even noticed you do. Then look into how neurotypicals and autistics react differently in the same situations. At the very least, understanding yourself, and how the condition affects you in all it\u2019s myriad and subtle ways, will make you more confident and better in tune with yourself, and that in turn may make it easier to make friends on it\u2019s own. You could also look for support groups for people your age with ASD, in your local area, to meet others who may have had similar experiences. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a 42 year old female who was diagnosed with AS at the age of 38. I struggled with the same thing you are my entire life. Here's what I've discovered. Anyone who fall within the autism spectrum have increased perception. While normal people have 5 senses, we have over 20. We perceive what others do not. This is why kids with AS or autism act out when they're out where there are crowds. We cannot stand the heat, the noise, we get overwhelmed with the many energies from other people. But being kids, being young or even adults who are wanting to be normal like others, we're not aware of our sensitivities. All we know is we're not comfortable. What you perceive as people not liking you is actually them changing their energies/aura because we don't talk like they do. We are straight talkers, often lacking tact, like a textbook. We do not possess the ability to romanticize, dramatize an issue or beat around the bush. Normal people, or neurotypicals get uncomfortable with pure honesty of straight talking. Which is ironic, because we, on the other hand, get uncomfortable and confused when people dramatize and beat around the bush. The good news is autistic people like us are natural psychics simply because our intuition and perception are extensive. Coupled with our natural high IQ, it shouldn't be too hard to navigate life. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steven Spielberg and many inventors have AS too. But at the same time there are also AS people who aren't famous like them. Understand that we are just wired differently and you will be fine. You will be most comfortable surrounded by other AS but bear in mind no two AS will be identical, just like neurotypicals. Also please don't fall into the trap of depression by seeking the approval or validation of neurotypicals, because out of lack of a better explanation, we and them are like 2 different species. I personally have always felt like an alien and I believe it is quite accurate. More children are being born autistic these days and that is a blessing. We would have more people we can get along with around. Also, the world needs repair and healing. We're not good at socializing/politicking, but we get the work done without drama. So if you will, you can regard that as your mission. Stay happy and keep doing things that excite you, that can bring betterment to the lives of everyone, autistic and neurotypicals alike, animals, nature and the world. I sincerely wish you the best with much love. ",
