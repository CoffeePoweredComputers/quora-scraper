            "answer_text": "How many books make up the Quran? Islamic Tradition will lead you to believe that the Quran is a single divine revelation from the One True God of Creation. Yet this is not the truth. When one reads the Quran and allows it to speak we find and a number of various writing borrowed from a number of various sources. Abraham is the Burning of Abraham Surah 21:68-70. A first century, Jewish Rabbi named Jonathan Ben Uziel was translating Genesis 15 into Aramaic. He came across the word \"Ur\", now Jonathan did not know Babylonian so he confused the Babylonian word \"Ur\", which means \"city\" with the Hebrew word \"Ur\", which means \"fire\". This caused him to mistranslate the passage. Instead of saying that God delivered Abraham out of \"Ur, the city of the Chaldeans\", Jonathan's mistranslation said that God delivered Abraham out of \"the fire of the Chaldeans\". If Allah gives authority to the inspiration and preservation of His text how does he allow a false version of a well-known story into the Quran? One of the so-called may wonder of the Quran is the knowledge of Embryology which according to Islam is only recently been discovered. Surah 23:12-14 Aelius Galenus or Claudius Galenus (129 AD \u2013 216AD), was better known as Galen of Pergamon was a Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire Arguably the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity. The account of the different stages in embryology as described by the Quran is identical to that taught by Galen. These are just two quick examples to show that the Quran is not a divine book but a compilation of many different stories and tales, ",

The relative authority of religious texts develops over time and is derived from the ratification, enforcement, and its use across generations. Some religious texts are accepted or categorized as some non-canonical, and others extracanonical, semi-canonical, deutero-canonical, pre-canonical or post-canonical. But to re state\u2026 the Quran is simply one stand alone book. ",
