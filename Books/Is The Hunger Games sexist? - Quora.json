            "answer_text": "Okay\u2026 let\u2019s unpack this a bit. Firstly, this article is a near-incoherent stream-of-consciousness written by someone who clearly does not have a lot of experience in either feminist critique or literary critique in general, and who does not appear to be familiar with the entire media that they are discussing. Their argument appears to be: The Hunger Games is widely lauded as feminist media, butThe Hunger Games is actually sexist, because:Katniss has no agency, as demonstrated by how:She never murders anyoneHer choices are not freeShe is constantly manipulated.Addressing Point 1\u2014there are two key misunderstandings here. Both are common mistakes by people not familiar (and some who are familiar) with feminist critique. The first misunderstanding is that the author seems to assume there is a dichotomy in which all media are either \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201csexist.\u201d Therefore (they reason), if the Hunger Games is sexist, it cannot be feminist. This is not the case. Media can feminist and sexist at the same time (more on this in a sec). Secondly (and interrelatedly), the author conflates two separate definitions of \u201cfeminist media.\u201d The first definition of \u201cfeminist media\u201d is \u201ca media whose creator\u2019s primary intention is to engage in feminist critique/discussion.\u201d The second definition of \u201cfeminist media\u201d is \u201ca media relatively lacking in sexism.\u201d This is a sloppy\u2014and, on the whole, incorrect\u2014definition that is, unfortunately, frequently used. Media are frequently praised for being \u201cfeminist\u201d when the media were not intended to send a feminist message at all, but simply happened to be less sexist than other mainstream media of the time. To examine this difference, let\u2019s look at two media from the last year or so that have been celebrated as \u201cfeminist\u201d\u2014Ghostbusters (2016) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Ghostbusters meets both definitions of feminist media. While the movie\u2019s creators had other goals (e.g., to make money, to entertain), their primary goal was clearly to engage in feminism, and they succeeded in creating a media that is relatively lacking in sexist themes. Mad Max was also relatively lacking in sexism, but that lack was not indicative of any intentional feminism on the part of its creators (per repeated statements by George Miller). Note that I loved both movies and actually prefer Mad Max; not being intentionally feminist isn't a bad thing. I would not want all my media to be feminist polemics. It\u2019s worth noting that both kinds of \u201cfeminist media\u201d can and usually do still contain sexist themes. Ghostbusters still engaged in misogynoir with the character of Patty. Mad Max still perpetuated sexist tropes about feminine attractiveness and body types. All media are created by fallible humans who were raised within a patriarchal system, and will therefore likely incorporate some sexist concepts, no matter how much they try to engage in feminist discourse. It is certainly true that Katniss has been celebrated for being a powerful female heroine by both feminists and the general public and that the Hunger Games have been generally been lauded for lacking the blatant sexism that most current action/young adult franchises have. However, that does not mean feminists are holding it up as an unflawed feminist media, but rather simply that it is somewhat less sexist than the mainstream average. The Hunger Games was not written to be feminist prose, and should not be read as such. Moving on to Point 2\u2014the author spends a large portion of the article arguing that Katniss never murders anyone. They address but dismiss the several people that Katniss does actually kill in the first book by either ignoring them completely (the kids killed by wasp stings), claiming that they were \u201cin the heat of battle/self-defense\u201d (Marvel), or that they were \u201cmercy-killings\u201d (Cato). However, they do not address any of the people Katniss kills in the rest of the franchise, including President Coin, who Katniss indisputably murders at the end of the third book (more on this in a bit). I have to conclude from this that the author has not actually read nor viewed the second or third book/second, third, and fourth films. When you are critiquing a piece of media, especially from a feminist lens, it\u2019s very important to be familiar with the entire media, not a fraction of it. Now, it\u2019s certainly true that in this story, Katniss being manipulated and her choices not being free is a main plot point. In fact, the entire story is about Katniss being repeatedly robbed of agency, forced to make choices she did not desire or fully understand. The author of the article under discussion interprets this as being sexist. What they miss\u2014presumably from not consuming the entire media, although I\u2019ve seen people make this mistake without that excuse\u2014is that depiction is not necessarily endorsement. Showing a female character who does not have agency is not necessarily sexist\u2014it depends on the context. Firstly, it\u2019s impossible to write a good story in which everyone has unlimited agency all the time\u2014that\u2019s not realistic. But more importantly, media can show a woman without agency in order to critique or otherwise make a statement about that lack of agency. In the Hunger Games, Katniss being robbed of her agency is an intentional tactic the author uses to deliver the primary message of the story. In the climax of the Hunger Games trilogy, Katniss finally realizes the extent to which she has been manipulated and robbed of agency and makes a free choice\u2014to murder President Coin\u2014that profoundly affects the lives of everyone else in the story. She reclaims her agency in perhaps the most brutal way imaginable, which subverts her prior lack of agency and negates any potential sexism stemming from such lack. Again, I don\u2019t think that the Hunger Games was meant to be a feminist polemic; the story is set in a dystopian future where there appear to be no real gender roles or sexism, which prevents it from really being able to address any feminist issues. I do actually agree that some of the celebration of Katniss as a feminist icon has been overblown, given that she as a character never confronts sexism or explicitly makes any feminist statements. However, this article\u2019s critique of the Hunger Games as being sexist is fundamentally flawed. ",

            "answer_text": "Ara Ogle did an excellent analysis of this really poorly written blog post, so if you want an excellent breakdown, well, I can\u2019t improve on that. My initial take-away is this\u2014it is not an article. Please keep this in mind if you reread it. This is a blog post. This is one person\u2019s opinion, being aired on a site that she herself owns. Which gives it exactly zero authority. Yes, the author claims to be a psychiatrist. And anyone can claim to be anything on the internet. I have to say that if this is, indeed, a prime example of the author\u2019s writing ability when it comes to anything remotely academic, she must have graduated in the bottom half of her class. The underlying rage and tl;dr in this blog post tells me one thing; the author has been offended by something about Hunger Games that actually has zero to do with the worth/feminism of the franchise itself. And I am not going to speculate about what that is, although I have a very good idea, based on personal experience, of what it could be. The bottom line is that this is essentially a rant. As Ara Ogle said, it is an incoherent rant. The author deliberately ignores or lies about plot points that would refute the thesis. This is not good writing, this is not good analysis, and this is not good feminism. Your take-away from this should be that \u201cjust because someone writes something on a blog, it does not follow that it is anything you need to give weight to.\u201d PS. I already knew within the first couple of paragraphs that this polemic was going to be worthless. Why? Because the author starts out her rant with a divergent screed about Rue being portrayed in the movie by a black actress, and people being surprised by that. There\u2019s just one problem with this screed. Anyone who actually read the book with any amount of care knew that Rue was black. It\u2019s explicitly written that she is black. Suzanne Collins has said she was black. And yet, the author of this blog post is somehow completely unaware of this\u2026and I cannot imagine how that could possibly be, unless she didn\u2019t actually read the books in the first place. ",
