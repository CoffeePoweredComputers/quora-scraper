            "answer_text": "Plan one nap (30 minutes in 6 minute intervals) and 3\u20135 incremental breaks lasting no more than 15 minutes each, write the notes when you have something to say rather than at planned points, and most importantly focus on quality of the notes over meeting a set number or finishing the book. A teacher will most likely appreciate 15 high quality entries covering 3/4ths of the book more than they would appreciate 20 decent entries covering the entire book; this idea is a result of having done both. Put in legitimate effort, and it the effort will show. Most teachers are willing to overlook more when they can see that you took an assignment seriously. ",
