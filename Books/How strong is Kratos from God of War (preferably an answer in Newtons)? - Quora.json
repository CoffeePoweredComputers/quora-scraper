            "answer_text": "Q. How strong is Kratos from God of War (preferably an answer in Newtons)? A. Unquantifiably strong.  Kratos is a being who can't be powerscaled on the basis of mortal concepts such as strength, speed, durability, etc. I'm not wanking or overly exaggerating him just because he's one of my favourite characters of all time. I'm applying basic logic. People usually judge him on the standards of the Scientific principles of our Universe. But the problem with that is the Cosmology of the GoW World. It's completely different when compared to our Universe's Cosmology. Our Universe is expanding. It's true size isn't known because of its ever-expanding attribute. While on the other hand, the GoW World is outright Infinite in size. Just like our own Universe, it contains Stars, Planets, Solar-System, etc. But, it's Infinite in size:-       (There is a Moon in the GoW World too).  (You can clearly see Stars and Constellations in the above Image). The primary reason for this must be the fact that all the GoW Games before GoW 4 were based on the Greek Mythology and their beliefs. They believed that the Universe was Infinite in size. Now Kratos scales to lifting all of the GoW World because he has wielded weapons which have the weight of the World behind them and can even bear the weight of the Cosmos:-     Now, how are you supposed to put that on a mortal concept such as strength? How do you expect someone to express it in Newtons? Infinite Newtons?! Well you know what? I don't want to piss-off some GoW downplayers, so I'll just call it un-quantifiable. ",

            "answer_text": "In his fight against Cronos, Kratos catched Cronos' hand when he tried to crush him with a clap. Based in a scene where Kratos stands next to Cronos' fingers, comparing it's width with Kratos' height (which seems to be over 5 times bigger than Kratos) and then comparing it with a human finger's width (I measured mine to be 2cm), I found that Cronos is atleast 450 times bigger than a human, which would make Cronos over 810m tall, a human of this size would weight 7 million metric tons. A hand represent around 1% of a human's body mass, meaning that Cronos' hand weights 72,900 tons. Cronos pulled his hand from very behind him to his extended left hand almost instantly, covering that much distance considering how big is Cronos means that his hand traveled hundreds of meters in less than a second. Cronos' arm seemingly crossed half circumference in less than a second and should be 450 times larger than a human arm (around .8m), which would be 360m. I can get a result using two ways. By reverting the formula 1/2at^2 =s, to get the acceleration is 2s/t^2 =a, which results in a=2261.94 m/s^2 , which multiplied by the mass results in Cronos' clap having a force of 164,895,426,000 Newtons. There\u2019s also the impact force formula, 2*m(mass)*v(speed)/t(contact time). To get the speed I\u2019ll measure the half circle his hand traveled: 2\u03c0(360)*(180/360)=1130.97 m. Also I\u2019ll assume the contact time being 0.1 seconds. So: 2*72,900,000*1130.97/0.1 =1,648,954,260,000 Newtons Kratos not only stopped the hand but also pushed it back, so it's strength must be greater than that. ",
