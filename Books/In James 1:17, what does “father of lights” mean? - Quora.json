            "answer_text": "This verse refers to God himself, Jehovah, the creator of the universe and the celestial bodies in it. Elsewhere in the Scriptures he is described thusly: \u201c[He] gives the sun for light by day, The laws of the moon and the stars for light by night\u201d - Jeremiah 31:35 \u201cGod is the one who said: \u201cLet the light shine out of darkness,\u201d and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.\u201d - 2 Corinthians 4:6 God is the supreme lightgiver, in that he created the heavenly bodies which give us literal light by day and night, and as the grand arbiter of truth, he frees us from fear and superstition with the clear light of truth contained in his inspired word, the Bible. In the light of these truths we need no longer fear death, and are set free from the confusion, false doctrines and unnecessary suffering brought on many in the world today. As God\u2019s own son said, \u201cYou will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\u201d - John 8:32 ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cEvery good thing bestowed and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation, or shifting shadow.\u201d James 1:17 \u201cLights\u201d refers to the luminaries in the sky: the sun, moon, and stars. Psalm 136:7 refers to God as \u201cHim who made the great lights.\u201d We see God\u2019s creation of these \u201clights\u201d in Genesis 1:14, on the fourth day of Creation. James\u2019 point here is that God is faithful to give us only what is good for us\u2014He doesn\u2019t drift off track, at times, and give us what is not good. In fact, though God is the Creator of these luminaries, He is more \u201cfaithful\u201d than they are, since they have \u201cshifting shadows\u201d\u2014that is, due to their movements, their shade \u201cshifts\u201d off of us by the minute!
