I recommend the reading one, since if you read the half book, you\u2019d obviously remember something. If not, shame on you. If you think reading is just looking at words and mindlessly flipping through pages, think again. To read is to imagine. As you read, you have to immersed within the book so much, you practically live the world, and can see, feel, taste, smell that world. Don\u2019t be lazy and don\u2019t ever disgrace the bookworm title. Sone people like to be called a bookworm, and take great pride in being one. You\u2019re just gonna make the bookqorms near yoy mad and sad. ",

But if you are pressed for time, then I\u2019d recommend skimming through the parts you have already read and try to recall what the main plot is. You can also skim as many times as you want to fill in the other relevant details like characters and setting if you wish. ",
