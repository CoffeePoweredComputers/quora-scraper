            "answer_text": "I would say that Nabokov\u2019s \u2018Ada or Ardor\u2019 - in many ways his magnum opus - it is a mammoth novel \u2014 (with many of the same themes as Lolita although it contains a whole lot more) has even better prose and wordplay than Lolita does. It is brilliant but not as well known due I think to its length. Definitely worth reading if you loved the prose style of Lolita (and so are other Nabokov\u2019s novels including Pale Fire as already mentioned and also Joyce\u2019s Ulysses (it was amongst Nabokov\u2019s favourites!); three other writers I\u2019d mention as having prose similar to Nabokov (or as good in many ways) are Lawrence Durrell (The Alexandra Quartet), anything by John Banville (for example, The Untouchable or The Sea) and Nadeem Aslam\u2019s Maps for Lost Lovers. I\u2019d also have to add Gabriel Garcia Marquez to this list (Love in the Time of Cholera). ",

            "answer_text": "Could you provide an example of Nabokov\u2019s remarkable prose after chapter 3 in Lolita? A la Recherche du Temps Perdu: Marcel Proust in English translated from French is better than Nabokov in English. It\u2019s like comparing an electronic harpsichord to a two story organ. Proust has much deeper engagement and empathy for his characters and he comes at language from so many directions that you can\u2019t reduce what\u2019s on the page to a style. ",
