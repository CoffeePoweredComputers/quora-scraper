            "answer_text": "Yeah, ncert biology will be a good shot for a mark in the range of 291\u2013300 in biology. I personally studied only class 11 and 12 ncert biology and managed to score 301 in neet 2019. The real thing is that you have to study it deeply and identify those hidden concepts in the text. Sometimes, when the concept is tough to understand we tend to mug up the lines. This mistake should not be commited and maximum efforts must be put on to understand the underlying concepts. I was actually preparing by self so I relied wholly on internet (youtube especially) for clearing my concepts. The second important thing is correlation. Every chapter is correlated to each other especially in class 11 biology. When you are able to correlate between chapters it indicates that your study is complete. I also bought the book \u2018ncert at your fingertips\u2019. But ended up not even solving a single question in it. For biology, personally i felt that practising MCQs is not that important so I invested all my time for studying rather than solving MCQs. And finally dont fear to study only ncert. I feared a lot at the start whether I would score well by studying only ncert. I had peer pressure obviously from my friends who went to institutes and were studying much more in biology. Still, I managed to get a good score only with ncert. All the best and thumbs up for those NEET 2020 aspirants. Enjoy your studies, maintain your calm and dont lose hope during any point of your preparation. ",
