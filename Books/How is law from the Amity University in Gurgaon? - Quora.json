            "answer_text": "ALS Gurgaon is actually I should say the best dept of Amity, Gurgaon. The faculty that are present are good and even the crowd is nice. ALS hosts some really good events like international moot court where law schools and universities from all over India participate. Even Amity Law school has some really good contacts I should say cause when there are AlS events prominent people have been called as chief guests. But one of the inside things I should mention to you is that the dept is also the most corrupted, if you want good GPAs just be a faculty bootlicker and be a involved student with ALS events and if by any means your parents are friends with the HODs and HOIs of ALS, wallah! You're a VIP and yes be a part of Amity Sangathan which is like it's annual sports day. Apart from these the studies are good. So if you want to have high GPA without a mediocre hard work then join ALS Gurgaon. ",
