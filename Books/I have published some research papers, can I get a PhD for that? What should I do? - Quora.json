            "answer_text": "Just publishing some papers is not enough to earn a doctorate. Being published, particularly if your papers are scholarly and published in quality academic journals, will help you to gain acceptance into a PhD program. Once there, you will need to take two years of classes that teach you how to conduct high level research. If you have already mastered those skills, these classes will be much easier for you, but you will still need to complete the coursework. Then, in order to earn your doctorate, you will need to complete a dissertation and defend that dissertation. Earning a doctorate is a long process and is not just about publishing papers - although that is a top focus of the coursework - it is really more about becoming a member of the scholarly community, through research and collaboration. Also, in your question you do not make reference to any currently held degrees. While there are instances of people completing PhDs without a master\u2019s degree, in most cases one must hold a master\u2019s degree in order to be accepted to a PhD program. If your research papers are of high quality, and you do not hold a master\u2019s degree, this might be grounds for a department to make an exception. They may be able to accept that the papers prove you are able to contribute at the doctoral level, but there is no guarantee. Good luck in your research. ",

            "answer_text": "Some universities do offer PhD through prior publication. For example, see the guidelines of Griffith University for this path to a PhD and those of Kingston University London. If the university granting your PhD by publication is reputable, you will usually need to have several papers published as lead author or sole author in well-regarded, international peer-reviewed journals, be admitted as a PhD student, and write a substantive acompanying exegesis to put the papers into context. The thesis (comprised mainly of these published papers) will then need to be assessed by experts in the field to ensure that you have made an original contribution that advances the state of the field (the same criteria used for a traditional PhD thesis). Depending on the university, you may also be required to pass an oral defence that will probe for weaknesses in your work or in your knowledge of the field. ",
