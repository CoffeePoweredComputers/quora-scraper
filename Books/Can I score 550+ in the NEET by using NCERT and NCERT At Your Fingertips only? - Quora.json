Only NCERT is the book which land you descent marks(at least 550)\u2026. For more go to little bit extra like HC Verma in Physics, MS Chauhan and N.Avasthi in Organic and Physical chemistry resp. But for Bio and Inorganic I will prefer only and only NCERT(Godfather book for NEET& AIIMS). Thank you. ",
