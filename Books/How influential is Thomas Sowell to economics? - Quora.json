            "answer_text": "Thomas Sowell\u2019s great talent is that he can communicate well with a public that has little or no education in how the economy works. He easily dispels misconceptions held as common knowledge among many people. His research is global, and is explained in historical context to expose many \u201cnew ideas\u201d as the old failures that they have been throughout history . Since public understanding is critical to good citizenship and a healthy political environment, his role as an educator of the public will have long term influence as his ideas are becoming more commonly accepted every day. That will eventually lead to better policy. ",

Thomas Sowell | Curriculum Vita  If you read his columns, you could easily be ignorant of the fact that he has a degree in economics. I will contrast the cv of Paul Krugman, and economist who also writes columns, his cv is full of academic articles.  Page on princeton.edu ",
