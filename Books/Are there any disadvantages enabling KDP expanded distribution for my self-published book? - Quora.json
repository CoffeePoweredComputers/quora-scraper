            "answer_text": "Are there any disadvantages enabling KDP expanded distribution for my self-published book? Here is the thing others are beating around the bush about but not saying: Amazon does not really distribute everywhere, and many of the places that could order books from them will not when they see it comes from their largest competitor. Also, when Amazon distributes outside of Amazon, it generally, mostly, uses Ingram, just like others are suggesting that you do. So\u2026 why would you want to use IngramSpark instead of letting Amazon use Ingam for you? 1) as I said before, many of the places that could order your books will not when they see it comes from Amazon. 2) when Amazon uses Ingram, they set up the account with the ISBN number for your book. That means that if you decide to use IngramSpark yourself in the future for whatever reason (like say KDP ignores your prayers and chooses to alter the deal further\u2026) you will have to contact both IngramSpark and KDP to get KDP to release the ISBN, to the real publisher\u2014you. If you don\u2019t do this, then you will have to use a second ISBN for the same edition of the book\u2014which kind of defeats the point of the ISBN. This whole ISBN fiasco is part of the reason why KDP and B&N check an ISBN as soon as you enter it and won\u2019t accept it if you have already set up a book at Ingram. That is a joke really. They don\u2019t deserve their \u201cown\u201d ISBN for the same edition of the book if all they are doing is printing it in a different place\u2026but, who am I to tell the gods of publishing what they should or shouldn\u2019t do. So, Are there any disadvantages enabling KDP expanded distribution for my self-published book? Yes. But, are they disadvantages that you care about? Probably not. How many bookstores do you expect will be ordering copies of your self-published book anyway? How closely are you using your ISBNs to track sales and distribution anyway? The real reason I even publish through KDP or B&N is the bump in percentage of sales earned by publishing directly through them over the percentage they take from books sold through Ingram. Otherwise, I would just use Ingram and forget it. Sometimes I think I may anyway. Still waiting for something better to come along\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. It allows Ingram Content to sell your books and Lightnight Source to print them. Their printing charges are higher than Kindles and Ingram Content takes 55% to 65%. Depending on how much you price the book for you\u2019ll make WAY less than through Amazon markets. I make like 55 cents a book through Expanded while I make $2.85 through Amazon Markets. But you reach more stores this way. Amazon doesn\u2019t market print books to Australia, but Ingram does. Ingram covers Sweden, Denmark, the Baltics, Greenland, Iceland. It covers mom and pop stores like Books a Million. The small store where you live orders from Ingram Content. Your book will probably NOT be carried by Barnes & Noble. (Go check after 2 weeks) so you might want to co-publish at Nook Books where you\u2019ll get $2.05 per book sale because Nook only takes 50% but Lightning Source prints it so it costs more than Kindle to print the book. You can OPT not to do Expanded Distribution and go directly to Ingram Spark where you\u2019ll make a little more money with the Mom and Pop stores and also get into Barnes & Noble. You\u2019ll probably make $1.50 to $1.75 per book sold because Kindle won\u2019t be taking a small share. You simply tell them NOT to distribute to Amazon. Of course if you go Direct with Amazon and Barnes & Noble you make more money than through Ingram because both companies only take 40 or 50% and Ingram takes 60% and charges more to print a book. Ingram also has more sizes and hard cover books. Ingram also charges LESS than Kindle for FULL COLOR books, but NOT for black and white books. Ingram also charges $49 setup fee. And if you need to correct a cover picture or inside text there is a $25 PER upload charge to replace a file. Nook and Kindle are totally FREE. Remember on ALL OF THESE. On EVERY SINGLE ONE. You get a stated royalty of 60%, 50% or 40% MINUS THE COST OF PRINTING THE BOOK. So on at $12 book through Kindle you get $7.20 minus $4.25 to print it. So you get $2.95. On Expanded you get $4.80 minus $4.25 so you get 55 cents. At Nook you\u2019ll get $6.00 minus a little more to print it, say $4.75 so you\u2019ll get $1.25. At Ingram on ALL sales of print Books you\u2019ll make about 15% after printing. You make 30% on eBooks. At Kindle you make 35\u201370% At nook you\u2019ll make 35\u201350%. At Smashwords you\u2019ll make 30 to 70% and at Draft2Digital you make 30%. Those who say Ingram pays more, GO to Kindle and Nook and see what their prices are like. You\u2019ll find you get 5 to 25% more money off DIRECT sales through a free Nook Book or Kindle Book than if Ingram sold it to Amazon or Nook. Ingram is ONE price to all. Kindle is a bigger price to INTERNAL sales and a much smaller price to EXTERNAL sales. Nook is Internal sales only and it\u2019s not as big as Amazon but bigger than Ingram, as is Draft2Digital. Smashwords is internal and external. ",

I think the people recommending IngramSpark don\u2019t realize that KDP\u2019s Expanded Distribution does the same thing. Though not sure how the royalties compare. I really wish that Amazon would allow to set the separate retail prices on Amazon and Extended Distribution channels. So in this sense IngramSpark might be better, allowing you to set the prices for two channels independently. ",

In my international forums, most of my author colleagues distribute on Draft2Digital, while some have chosen PublishDrive as I did. Smashwords is also a perennial favorite. When uploading on other platforms, just opt out of those outlets you\u2019ve already covered. Too much information? Don\u2019t get discouraged - you\u2019ll become accustomed to the options and information as you spend time with all of it. I strongly recommend against exclusivity on one platform. ",
