            "answer_text": "I believe in going back to first principles. Drucker represents these pretty well, His thinking is sound. He is of an earlier era so, as with all first principle thinkers, he will need to be interpreted in terms of today\u2019s knowledge and technology. His work needs more translation (transformation?). That is because we are just creeping up on the beginning of an era change. The information age, the digital age, is not the machine age that he was speaking to. He couldn\u2019t speak for the current age because it is a dramatic shift. This doesn\u2019t make his writing useless. It just means you have to work harder. Do more thinking on your own (or with a current \u201cguru\u201d). Because the new era is in its infancy, most management theory will need some serious transformative thinking to be much use. it\u2019s worth the effort! ",

Well SMART which means Specific, Measurable,Acceptable,Realistic andTime-boundhas been still followed by most marketers and is definitely the most proven method. This process will never get old, whether it's offline or online. We are following the same rule in today's Digital Marketing too. ",
