            "answer_text": "Yeah, even though you are a good singer, if you want to sing badly and off-key, you could do it. It would not be comfortable to do so, though, since good technique is key to producing in tune singing. To sing badly would require dropping good technique, and might result in discomfort, since bad technique is hard on the vocal apparatus. ",

            "answer_text": "Completely possible, to some degree. Anecdotal evidence, but for me personally, singing off key, purposefully, for a long period of time is quite hard. You spend so much of your life trying to stay in key. Being out of key is like a danger signal so the natural reaction is to get back in key. You might liken it to \"good attack\" in Dance Dance Revolution, where the key to the self-imposed challenge is to stay off the beat consistently (versus the canonical version where you stay on the beat and get perfect attacks).
