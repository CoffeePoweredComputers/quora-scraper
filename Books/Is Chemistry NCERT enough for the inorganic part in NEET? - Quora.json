Many a times students feel that after reading certain topic they forget it on the next day itself , for the you have to consider it like biology and remember the facts, develop new tricks by your own to remember for a long time.Most of the times in inorganic part the questions are asked on the exceptions, so concentrate on them.Once you are okay with the facts , properties and the nature of the elements try to understand the chemical reactionsTo learn inorganic in a fun way you can watch video lectures of Dushyant Kumar sir on Youtube and you can also purchase his book inorganic in my pocket. Watch all his videos and you will be perfect in chemistry!Atlast Revise-RE-Revise_Revise!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "A2A!! Yes NCERT is more than sufficient for inorganic chemistry. I haven't seen any such question in previous year papers which I couldn't solve after reading that topic from NCERT. Also, many of the questions are being repeated so you should practice previous questions atleast 3\u20134 times so that you can easily recall the answer if you see a similar question. Practice H202 volume related questions from some other source too. Hope this helps!! ",
