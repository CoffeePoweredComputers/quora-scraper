            "answer_text": "Stephen King's IT is over 1000 pages long and contains adult themes, I don't believe this is a question of how old you need to be as how mature you are and what you're reading level is. If you can read long books without complaint, it shouldn't matter your age as long as you at least know what you're getting into. One of the adult themes in the novel is sex, and there's a couple of love making sequences so, of course at the very least someone looking to read IT should have a basic understanding of what sex is. A few of the actors who portrayed the adult Losers Club in IT chapter 2 actually reread the book to prepare for the role, having first read it as teenagers. Which is actually why I would recommend reading IT as a young adult, and rereading IT as an adult, it's a very different experience between the two, and makes the read all the better to have both perspectives. As far as a first read goes, I think the lowest I've personally heard of someone reading IT is thirteen, which seems like a good recommended reading age to me. But there are other factors to consider as well, again this is a horror story, and dark themes like abuse are present, if your family is conservative that's an entire ball park I'm not sure I can help you with, just be sure you're prepared for the type of storytelling you're in for. IT also flashes back and forth between timelines so if you can't keep the timeline straight you night want to sit this one out. ",

But there are some VERY adult situations in IT so be prepared. There is one in particular i can think of that is pretty out there. I won't ruin anything but just be prepared. I've read IT also and it's the best book I've ever read if that helps. ",
