            "answer_text": "It took me about a month but I really enjoyed it. I had read The Secret History a few years back and found it ok. I had attempted and given up on The Little Friend but after pushing through the first 100 pages over the last week (long bus journeys), I am now really enjoying it. I found the plot of The Goldfinch to be consistently compelling. I like the way that the author withholds details to keep you guessing about the setting in time (even truer of The Little Friend). Tartt seems most comfortable in an old-fashioned upper class, American milieu but I felt that she broke out of this somewhat with the character of Boris and the fascinatingly intense relationship that she depicts between him and the protagonist, Theo. I also felt that meditations about art history and the traumatic impact of 9/11 were both subtly and skilfully interwoven into the plot. The ending is a touch too melodramatic for my liking and there are a few characters who never really feel filled out. All the same, I found this a really good book which fully paid back the obvious time investment required to finish it. Recommended. ",
