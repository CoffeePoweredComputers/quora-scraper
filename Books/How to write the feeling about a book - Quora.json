            "answer_text": "If your question refers to how you would write a review about a book, and honest and properly constructed review is always appreciated by any Author. Keeping that in mind, no Author appreciates a poorly written review. You can\u2019t give a book a bad review just because you don\u2019t like the style of the book because it doesn\u2019t fit the way you would write it. For example, there are many different types of murder mysteries. If you\u2019re going to review a murder mystery that is not written the way you like to read a murder mystery, it is not fair to give it a bad review. Therefore, keep in mind if you\u2019re going to write about how you felt about a book, be sure you are being unbiased. ",
