            "answer_text": "The Bible is a sealed book; and can only be understood by divine intervention.(Luke 24:45) \u201cThen opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures\u2026\u201dBut what kind of people are those who will not (in any manner) understand the Scriptures?The Bible calls them wicked.(Daniel 12:9-10) \u201cAnd he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.\u201dWho are the wise that will understand? Hosea 14:9 says:   \u201cWho is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.\u201dThe wise, the prudent, and the just will understand. No wonder anybody alleging that the Bible is full of anti-scientific nonsense is not just prudent and wise. Let us prove this.Brain alleged that the Bible was written by primitive people who have no knowledge of science at all. Thanks for his ignorance of the kind of people who wrote the Bible. If the Bible was not divinely inspired, how can primitive people write scientific facts long before they were understood by modern science? David knew and wrote that stars and other heavenly bodies wax old and will vanish away.(Psalms 102:25-26) \u201cOf old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed\u2026\u201dThe presence of black holes in the vast space of the universe which, according to science, are remains of a star that collapsed, proves the scientific precision of what was written by David about 3,000 years ago.http://www.eclipse.net/~cmmiller/BH/blkbh.htmlThe scientific fact that the earth is hanging on an empty space in the universe is a divine information and a scientific truth that was written by a \u2018primitive\u2019 man many thousands of years ago.(Job 26:7) \u201cHe stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.\u201dThe recent findings of modern scientists, that human beings are not to be considered herbivore or omnivore, but frugivore, proves another scientific fact written by Moses in the book of Genesis many millennia ago.(Genesis 2:16) \u201cAnd the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat\u2026\u201dThere are people even scientists that believe that humans evolve from apes and other lower forms of life. They claim that evolution is guided by two important factors: Natural Selection and Survival of the fittest. If it is true that we evolve from apes, then we should have developed, by natural selection, enzymes for the digestion of cellulose like those that are very much present in apes and other herbivores; But until now, science can attest to the fact that human beings do not posses in his digestive system, the enzyme called cellulase that digest the cellulose in plants.Saliva pH Varies Widely Among SpeciesThe saliva pH of various species is another determinant of their natural diet. In carnivores, their saliva glands are small and secrete an acid saliva having little or no effect on starch, which makes sense since flesh is virtually starch-free. Omnivores (like pigs) have tremendous salivary glands that secrete copious quantities of starch-splitting enzymes. Humans only have one starch-splitting enzyme, versus a multitude of them in omnivores and other natural starch-eating animals. Our ptyalin is very limited. This rules us out as being true granivores (starch-eaters) which includes grains and cereals. Frugivores have salivary glands that secrete alkaline saliva, containing only moderate amounts of ptyalin, which initiates starch digestion. This tells us that humans and other frugivores can easily digest the small amount of starch contained in fresh fruits, nuts, and leafy greens, and that humans are not intended to subsist on a diet of highly starchy grain foods as many currently do. (Diabetes mellitus is largely the result of consuming large amounts of refined sugars and starches. Even eating predominantly of whole grains and natural legumes as dietary staples can be injurious because of the need for excessive starch digestion).(http://www.iol.ie/~creature/BiologicalAdaptations.htm)Another striking truth is that, although humanity has, for thousands of years, been consuming grains and starchy foods, his system has not developed the right enzyme necessary to break down or digest starches in raw grains and cereals. If evolution is true, as other anti-Bible scientists believe, mankind (in its long history) consuming such food stuffs must have developed the necessary digestive enzymes needed for the proper assimilation of this foods in their raw states. The fact that the human body has all the enzymes necessary to digest all nutrients in a fruit (especially its sugar content that is food for the brain), proves that we are frugivore; and proves the scientific excellence and knowledge in the Bible written by supposedly primitive men. In summary, meat is not a suitable item of diet for humans for the following physiological reasons:1. Flesh eating animals have a short intestine and bowel enabling them to rapidly expel the putrefactive flesh, while humans have a long, complicated alimentary canal which enables plant nutrients to be slowly absorbed and assimilated;2. Flesh eaters have a different type of intestinal bacterial flora than non-meat eaters (including humans);3. Flesh eaters have long sharp teeth, whereas humans have the teeth of frugivores; 4. Humans can grind their jaw, but flesh-eaters cannot: their jaws move vertically only;5. Humans sweat through their skin (as do other non meat-eaters such as horses, cows, monkeys, antelopes etc.) whereas flesh-eaters sweat through their tongues;6. Humans suck their liquids, whereas carnivores lap their liquids;7. Human saliva contains ptyalin (to commence starch digestion), whereas flesh-eaters have no ptyalin;8. Flesh-eaters secrete 10 times the quantity of hydrochloric acid in to the stomach than does a human (at a concentration much greater as well). This enables carnivores to cope with ingested bone, flesh, feathers, sinews, etc. True meat-eaters take nourishment from practically the whole prey not just muscle and selected organ meat as do humans;9. Carnivores have large livers to aid in detoxifying the blood, and to generate massive bile secretion, but humans have a comparatively smaller liver.10. Carnivores generate the enzyme uricase to metabolize uric acid, a naturally occurring waste product in meat. Humans do not generate nor metabolize uricase. As a result, uric acid is absorbed, which leads to age-related disease. When humans started eating meat they did not over a period of thousands of years, develop fangs, claws, the ability to secrete uricase, or the concentrated hydrochloric acid solution which characterizes true carnivores. You need but examine the Eskimos who, perhaps, have eaten meat the longest to confirm this. Species adapt very slowly to changed environmental conditions.(http://www.iol.ie/~creature/BiologicalAdaptations.htm)Another top of the line scientific knowledge written by supposedly primitive men that highlights the scientific supremacy of the Bible is written in 1 Corinthians 15:39.\u201cAll flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.\u201dThe apostle Paul has no knowledge at all of the DNA or the genes in any living flesh. When he wrote that human flesh is different from animal flesh, he is writing scientific information that will only be understood by humanity through the science of genealogy.Genealogy is a new branch of science that studies the genes and the DNA of living organisms. It is wonderful to know that although, physically, there seems to be no difference at all between a human and an animal flesh, but by the study of the DNA in humans and that of animals, science was able to determine the exact difference of the two \u2014 proving that the Bible is a no-nonsense and is not an anti-scientific book.The recent study of human DNA can trace where on earth civilization has started. The fact discovered by DNA scientists has established the trail from where global population originated: and it points to where, according to the Bible, Adam and Eve first lived.There are hundreds of modern scientific informations written in this supposedly primitive book which we can not tackle and finish on one posting; but I believe that anybody with \u2018brains\u2019 can perceive and see the glaring truth that the Bible has in its pages. I pray to God that their brains be fed by sugars from a fruit and not the protein from an animal, which is the delight of carnivorous people. ",

Almighty God says,\"God created the world with the word, leads people of the entire universe with the word, and conquers and saves people of the entire universe with the word, and in the end he will end the entire old world with the word. Only in this way will he accomplish the entire management plan. In the entire Age of the Kingdom, God does the work with the word and achieves the results of the work by the word. He does not perform signs or miracles but just does the work with the word. People all receive nourishment and supply because of the word and gain knowledge and have real experiences because of the word. People in the Age of the Word have really received extremely great blessings. They do not undergo physical suffering, but just enjoy the rich supply of God\u2019s word. They do not need to search or run around, and in ease they see God\u2019s appearing, hear God\u2019s personal utterance, receive God\u2019s supply, and see God\u2019s personal working. All these are what people in the past generations could not enjoy and are the blessings people in the past generations could not receive.\" from The Words Appears in The Flesh  ",
