How long do you think you could keep that up before the way people look at you would finally make you shut up? I don\u2019t mean when your friend dared you to say it and they are laughing in the background and you keep going because they are going to put this on YouTube. I mean, how long can you keep doing it when you are all by yourself and you are trying to get people to give you money? Yes, it is a lot like panhandling. But instead of asking for pity or mercy, you are telling people you are the greatest and they should give you money! Yes, it is a lot like being a salesperson working on commission. But instead of selling a product you beleive in, you are selling a part of yourself that you KNOW everyone who looks at it will judge. And usually harshly. Because you are screaming how great it is. Selling your own book is hard. Damn hard. At least for me. I have seen some authors jump in front of their fellow authors and steal sales. Obviously it is not hard for them. But I can\u2019t do that. (I tend not to like those kinds of people.) I work best with a team of other authors where we can take turns building each other\u2019s stuff. Promoting each other and selling each other\u2019s books. We\u2019ll share a table and I\u2019ll sell a few copies of yours and you sell a few copies of mine. It works out much easier that way. Usually. Until I started sharing a table with people who have Big Names that I feel like I am bragging too much if I mention! At that point, when someone comes by it gets really hard to ask a Big Name to try to sell some of your books. They usually try to do that for you anyway, even if you don\u2019t ask. Most are really nice people, but everyone is there to see them anyway. Fans don\u2019t want their favorite author to tell them to check out this other person standing next to them, they want to talk to their favorite author. Hmmm\u2026 I feel like I started to ramble. Sorry. Even for the Big Names it is hard. It is easy when a fan comes up and the fan is all excited, but they can (almost) all tell you stories of sitting at signings when no one showed up and how awkward it is. It\u2019s really hard to stand up and start yelling at the people who are walking by, ignoring you, \u201cHey!Look at me! I am great! I AM GREAT! I am the best thing since before sliced bread! There is nothing out there better than me!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t know the ins and outs of marketing, then extremely hard. The problem with selling books is that majority does not like to read. That in essence means that you\u2019re trying to sell stuff that majority does not want in the first place. To make matters worse, most people already have their genres figured out, so if your work relates to a field of study that most people have little to no interest in, then it become an even harder task. Having said that, when I was actively looking to market my book, I did come across a solution where the marketing company was promising a guaranteed sale of a minimum of 6000 copies to the libraries in the US. At the time, I just did not feel that it was a morally right way to gain sales. In my then view, it translated into taking advantage of some loophole in the system to sell your stuff. ",
