            "answer_text": "I have to go with Camp Half Blood, while the Romans have a more dedicated training(rather more strict training), they are largely trained by the most skilled among them, that being the Centurions of each Cohort who are in complete control of their training while in Camp Half Blood their training is supervised by Chiron, the same one who trained Achilles, Hercules, Jason, Theseus among other notable heroes, Chiron was skilled enough with a sword that he was capable of holding his own against Kronos even when it was not his preferred weapon, with a bow Chiron\u2019s skills is said to be impressive even by Apollo\u2019s godly standards and unlike Lupa, Chiron will fight with the campers. And Romans only outnumber the Greek by about 50, but unlike the Romans the Greek also include up to 150 more Satyrs and even more nature spirits getting their numbers well above the Romans, and you remember how devastating Percy was towards the Romans, that he took down the first and second cohort largely on his own, while no other fighter in Camp Half Blood has their skills to the level of Percy, they are some that are close, such as Clarisse, and Annabeth. In the Titan War the Romans stormed the Titan base of Mount Othrys that while it was well defended it was nothing compared to the force that was taken to Manhattan where the \u2018real\u2019 fight was going to take place, and the Greek managed to survive that with only 14 casualties while the Titan\u2019s casualties numbered in the thousands(that is actually a fact, mentioned in the \u2018Son of Magic\u2019 short story), which included a great deal of demigods that were trained personally by Luke and were deemed as a worthy honor guard for Kronos by Atlas himself. Furthermore, counting the Hecate cabin, only one of them was capable of turning more than 10 legionnaires into pigs at the same time. All in all the Greek simply have better fighters and variety on their side, as well as more reliable allies, with the hunters, the cyclopes, the satyrs, nature spirits and the party ponies. The only real ally the Romans have are the Amazons and even that alliance is rather shaky and from what we have seen their Greek have the more powerful fighters since most of the legionnaires are not even demigods, they are legacies. The only truly powerful demigods that the Romans have are Hazel and Frank and while Hazel is a really good fighter and a very powerful demigod she doesn\u2019t compare to Nico who while completely drained from shadow traveling and dissolving into shadows was able to defeat 6 fully armored Romans with only his sword(while limiting himself to not killing them) and Frank can be countered by Leo since Frank is deadly afraid of fire, and Romans don\u2019t even have sons/daughters of Athena to help with strategy. EDIT: At the end of the day while the Romans are far more disciplined, which would make a huge difference in a conventional fight, but this is not a conventional fight. Discipline doesn\u2019t mean much when Ares cabin can turn your weapons into rubber or the Demeter cabin turning the battlefield into a jungle at their whims with plants attacking you as you go, or the Hephaestus cabin bombarding you with Greek Fire, or the children of Apollo killing you with sound, the Hecate cabin turning your front lines into pigs, the Hypnos cabin demoralizing and tiring you, Nico sending unbeatable skeletons to cause mayhem in your ranks, Percy and Jason(Jason chose the Greeks, that is the reason that he couldn\u2019t lead Diocletan's armies, but could command the Greek Venti) cooking up a storm that would slow your advances to a crawl while it affects their allies as if the storm was not there at all(this is if they don\u2019t want to hurt them otherwise Percy can just send a veritable tsunami towards them while Jason electrocutes the water, results being some very dead Romans), while Thalia is snipping you with devastating lightning attacks. This is just not a fight that the Romans can win. for more on this topic go here:137395 ",

            "answer_text": "I have to say that New Rome would win. They have WAY more numbers. The legion itself has more numbers and they can also call upon their reserves(in the city).They have their eagle standard. Camp Half-Blood has the Athena Parthenos which is nice but it is mainly a defensive artifact and if the Romans are smart they would wait for the Greeks to come to them or lay siege upon the Greeks. Camp Half-Blood doesn\u2019t have any weapons that can significantly help their cause like the standard.Superior animals/mounts. In the Blood of Olympus that equestrian(Butch I think?) said that the Roman eagles were killing all the pegasi and Clarisse said that their airspace was dominated.MUCH MUCH more money and more actual artillery rather than just troops. Octavian was shown to have onagers(which are really expensive) and I\u2019m pretty sure if Reyna hadn\u2019t called time out the Romans would have wiped out Camp Half-Blood in 30 more seconds.I\u2019m leaving hunters and amazons out of this because they wouldn\u2019t favor one side or the other for the most part. In the Mark of Athena, Reyna was EXTREMELY confident Camp Half-Blood would be destroyed and Annabeth wasn\u2019t really sure she could reject this notion. I\u2019m not gonna talk about individual demigods because both sides have about the same amount and I don\u2019t want to quibble over skill because in the grand scale of things it doesn\u2019t matter that much(Percy, Annabeth, Clarisse L., Nico vs Frank, Hazel, Arion(yes, I counted the horse), Mike K.). (Not including people who are dead, settled elsewhere, or have left the camps like Jason, Piper, Leo, Reyna, etc.). ",
