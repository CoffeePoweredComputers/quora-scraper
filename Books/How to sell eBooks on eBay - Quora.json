            "answer_text": "Digital items like eBooks are sold under Other. There is very little protection for sellers of digitally shipped items, so be sure to price your book to allow for a relatively high number of claims of non-delivery, etc. To put \u2018relatively high\u2019 into perspective, WalMart has an overall shoptheft rate of less than 1.5%. You will do better if before selling you already have a solid reputation reflected in your feedback. My rule of thumb is that you should have at least 10 positive feedbck from buying before thinking about selling. But, because shipping is effectively free, you can ship internationally without any more concern (or cost) that restricting distribution to your own country. You may find that eBay is a very small part of your online sales, since most eBook buyers are more likely to be looking on Amazon or iTunes. ",
