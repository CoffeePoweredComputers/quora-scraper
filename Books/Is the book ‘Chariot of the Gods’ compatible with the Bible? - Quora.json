God declared his Word as the only Method of finding him,,, Originally voiced to Israel before crossing over into the promised Land, and applicable to the Gentiles (non Jews ) today, in the form of the Commandments of Christ,, Deu 30:10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. Deu 30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. Deu 30:12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Deu 30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Deu 30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. Deu 30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; Deu 30:16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. God and his Purpose can only be found through the Scriptures , not Sci-fi orientated writers. Bible Truth And Prophecy ",

            "answer_text": "No. The \u201cChariot of the Gods\u201d book was written in a supposedly authoritative manner by posing questions but in a manner that always suggested extra terrestrial intervention and invention, whereas the bible, also a collection of fiction, mythology, conjecture and misinformation, provides answers in an authoritative manner that suggests divine intervention and invention. For entertainment value and readability, the \u201cChariot of the Gods\u201d beats the Bible by a country mile because of the photographs. And it does not use archaic words and phrases to give an illusion of gravitas. ",
