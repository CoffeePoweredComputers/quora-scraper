            "answer_text": "It's a considerably more complex question than it appears at first blush. Written is definitely not the same as published. Up until the industrialization of publishing in the 19th century, it is really hard to give a definitive count. Should one include pamphlets, political or pornographic, which made up the bulk of publishing in the 18th century? They were anonymous for the most part, and circulated under the radar. They were very popular though.So that's one thing.Then you have to consider translation activity. Translation exploded in the 19th century: does one double-count translations or not?And how about the deluge of corporate and institutional literature? training manuals, owners' manuals, corporate reports, studies, etc etc.  Are these considered books in their own right? I mean some of that stuff is very long, appeared in a bound format and contains a lot of information?Finally, you have to consider the multiplication of media. Amazon now carries millions upon millions of ebooks, mostly written by amateur writers and content farms. Do these count? In effect, technology has enabled a true democratization of self-publishing. As a result, there has never been more books written and published. BUT, if these written works do not go through the old system of editors and publishers, do they really count as books in the classical sense of the term?The big question I guess is: given the explosion of information products and the increasing number of media delivery platforms, what counts as a book?

            "answer_text": "Google Books estimates that there are about 130 million books in existence.  If you double that, it's probably more than enough to cover all the books that ever existed.  UNESCO estimates that about 2 million books are published worldwide each year, but that includes older books as well as new ones.  Of course, there are inherent ambiguities; when are separate editions of a book separate books, and so on. ",
