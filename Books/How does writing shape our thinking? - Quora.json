            "answer_text": " Unlike any impetuous activity, writing is an act of unearthing the fragments of teeming reminiscence, flaming existence, and upcoming dreams. These fragments of thoughts are disoriented under the piling speculations, aspirations, conceptions, and condemnations. While settling somewhere down to jot down anything, our cognition streamlines the links that connect the near and distant relations of the mother thought. Moreover, it inspires to wander far and delve deep to find the withered roots once strived to fetch fresh water to our soul. Thereby, bringing the dispersed factions of the idea, writing helps to mold and beeline our thinking capacity. ",
