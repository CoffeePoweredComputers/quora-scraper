            "answer_text": "Are you actually asking how many words he uses in English? He\u2019s a best selling author of a number of books - and whether some were ghost written or not, he would have played a part in every book. He\u2019s also been President for several years that speaks around the world constantly. He graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and anthropology. It\u2019s been reported that his IQ was 156 by one media outlet that was not highly reputed, and leftist media jumped on it. However,  Snopes.comThe definitive Internet reference source for urban legends, folklore, myths, rumors, and misinformation.http://Snopes.com  fact-checked the story and wrote that Trump\u2019s IQ score \u201cwas between 145 and 149, not 156.\u201d Good grief. That still places him in the top 15 Presidents by IQ of all time. He is still at least 5\u201310 points higher than Abraham Lincoln and George Washington (both at 140). Ulysses S. Grant had the lowest of the Presidents, at 120. According to Brainmetrix.com: \u201cIf you have an IQ range of 140 and over, it means you are a genius or almost genius. 120 - 139 : With an IQ of 120 to 139, it means you have very superior intelligence and your intelligence is better than most.\u201d Meaning that every single American President was ranked with superior intelligence. Leftists need to lay off on Trump\u2019s intelligence - it\u2019s a game they won\u2019t win. According to the New York Times, President Trump\u2019s dad, Fred Trump, \u201cdied in 1999 with an estimated net wealth between $250 million and $300 million\u201d. Fortune wrote in 2018: \u201cPresident Trump's 2018 net worth at $3.1 billion.\ufeff That makes him the 259th-richest person in the country. While Trump dropped eleven spots on Forbes' ranking as compared to the previous year and slid 138 spots since he announced his presidential bid in 2015, he is nevertheless one of the wealthiest U.S. presidents.\u201d You dont take a $300 million fortune and turn it into billions without some measured intelligence. And it\u2019s laughable to state he was \u201cone of the wealthiest\u201d - for even using a very conservative value of $3.1 billion for Trump, according to \u201c24/7 Wall Street\u2019s\u201d 2016 valuation of each president's peak net worth; \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s worth is equal to more than every other President combined. plus several hundred $billion. The 2nd richest was George Washington worth $587 million.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "You can cite studies, reports, analysis by experts, and whatever. But your most reliable guide is to hear him speak. You get a lot of \u201cstrongly, tremendous, like you\u2019ve never seen before, incredible, bigly, huge,\u201d and the other words like that. Some say this is fourth-grade language. I was prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt and suggest that he tailored his language to his base (make of that what you will), but you would expect than in a setting among his peers like other national leaders, US lawmakers and government (both federal and state) officials, he might adopt a slightly more er, let\u2019s go with sophisticated, language. Alas and alack he has not because he cannot. There is no way that Trump has read the bible nor any possibility that he had even skimmed Hitler\u2019s writing. I could chuck a bunch of examples here where he talks about nuclear and government and plans but if you wanted to see that, you are quite capable of finding them. That you cannot or do not suggests that you don\u2019t want to. Which is fine. Everyday, Trump provides more and more examples of his lack of vocabulary and language skills. Someone pointed out that our vocabulary deteriorates with age. Perhaps. So I sought videos of interview with him going back to the 70s. He was a little bit more lucid, the sentences were better structured, the train of thought left the station and arrived more or less where it was meant to go. But language-wise, not a whole lot of difference. My qualifications for saying this: I was a journalist for a national paper for 25 years, specifically a sub-editor whose job is fact-checking and making sure that news reports were lucid and could be read by the average reader. The language of the news reports differed markedly from that in the editorial and op-ed pages. Most readers skip those pages and the tone there is a little more serious and academic, deliberately. Man bites dog stories don\u2019t appear there. More like the philosophy of humans biting domestic animals type of commentary. In short, Trump has a tiny vocabulary (matches his hands). Read everything he writes in tweets, listen to his speeches (scripted and off-the-cuff). It\u2019s quite apparent. ",

He notes thatTrump claims to have been to all the best schools and been a star student throughout yet, as McWhorter says \u201c it was all quite clearly wasted\u201d. Look at a Trump speech. He cannot phrase an idea, there is little logic in his development of a theme, his vocabulary is narrow, and his coverage of any topic is superficial showing he has minimal understanding. He cannot answer questions rather jumps on to formulaic phrases, or throws insults, before trying to detract away from that asked. Unfortunately some people, although a decreasing number, are taken in. Claims of high IQ, successful businessman, great author etc. all come from Trump own self inflation. There is no external information to show these to be true - rather external information suggests precisely the opposite. ",

His vocabulary is extremely small basic and simple. He cannot create complex sentences. He has no concept if paragraphs. He cannot speak intelligently on any subject. Literally. Everyone with experience of him in school or college has one opinion. Trump was the most god damn worst student they ever had. No one ever says wow what a smart guy. He left an impression if being a bully and utterly stupid. It certainly has made his mark. He could not pass even basic tests including a vocabulary. He paid someone to take his SATs. His father paid a lot of money to get him into Wharton. As far as IQ goes, the consistent \u2018kitchen table talk\u2019 is he is somewhere in the mid 80's. My professional opinion varies. I can get by with that gracious number. No one of any level of professionals available who would sign off on his delusions he has about himself. That's serious malpractice. Left on his own, he could get admission to community college . He wouldn't get in a college with a moderate admissions process. That's based solely on his behavior and manner of speech. ",

            "answer_text": "Old age can effect vocabulary, and at 76, I often need a thesaurus to find words I KNOW used to come to me without effort, something doctors tell me is to be expected. Age isn't my only hindrance; I was diagnosed with High Functioning Autism when I was 67, and never DID have a good short-term memory. A few \u201cminor\u201d strokes and cardiac problems didn\u2019t help. The President is younger than I am and should be much more flexible in his utterances than I am \u2014 yet he very often isn\u2019t. From STAT, Trump wasn\u2019t always so linguistically challenged. What could explain the change? By SHARON BEGLEY @sxbegle MAY 23, 2017 (excerpts): In interviews Trump gave in the 1980s and 1990s (with Tom Brokaw, David Letterman, Oprah Winfrey, Charlie Rose, and others), he spoke articulately, used sophisticated vocabulary, inserted dependent clauses into his sentences without losing his train of thought, and strung together sentences into a polished paragraph, which \u2014 and this is no mean feat \u2014 would have scanned just fine in print. This was so even when reporters asked tough questions about, for instance, his divorce, his brush with bankruptcy, and why he doesn\u2019t build housing for working-class Americans. \u2026 \u2026 Reagan\u2019s speech was riddled with indefinite nouns (something, anything), \u201clow imageability\u201d verbs (have, go, get), incomplete sentences, limited vocabulary, simple grammar, and fillers (well, basically, um, ah, so) \u2014 all characteristic of cognitive problems. That suggested Reagan\u2019s brain was slipping just a few years into his 1981-1989 tenure; that decline continued. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1994. Bush showed no linguistic deterioration; he remained mentally sharp throughout his 1989-1993 tenure and beyond. Trump used to be more articulate. What could explain the change? This has been looked into. From the UK\u2019s The Independent, Mr Trump scores the lowest of any of the past 15 presidents, by Emily Shugerman, Tuesday 09 January 2018 16:57 (excerpt): An analysis of the President's first 30,000 words uttered in office found Mr Trump speaks at a third- to seventh-grade reading level \u2013 lower than any other President since 1929. Mr Trump\u2019s vocabulary and grammatical structure is \u201csignificantly more simple, and less diverse\u201d than any President since Herbert Hoover, the analysis found. The comparison is based on interviews, speeches and press conferences for every president dating back to 1929, compiled by online database Factba.se. Analysts at Factba.se studied the \u201coff-script\u201d remarks of all 15 men \u2013 essentially, everything but their prepared speeches \u2013 to compare and contrast their speaking skills. Donald Trump speaks at the level of an 8-year-old, analysis finds Sic transit gloria mundi \u2014 Thus passes worldly glory. ",

This means at the VERY least he is fluent in English and has the basics of one other language. I appreciate a tendency of his that is highly contentious to the media- he asks laymen's questions to authorities (of their field), when he doesn't understand or there is uncertainty. To many this behavior may seem as if he is ignorant and it is definitely not the way we perceive or expect The President to act- but that is complete nonsense. It actually shows that he is a) a good learner b) translating terms and/or concepts that may be confusing to the general public c) asks questions he thinks un-knowledgeable people may ask. I think Trump is intelligent, if not suffering from megalomania, and I would assume his vocabulary is extensive in the area of his expertise (economics/business) ",

From my limited knowledge, Trump\u2019s vocabulary appears to be extremely minimal from the times when I have heard him speak. That is particularly true when he speaks extemporaneously. When Trump speaks from a written speech which is probably written for him by a speechwriter, he appears to have a slightly more impressive vocabulary. However, when he does speak from a prewritten speech, he often mispronounces some of the words which indicates that he is not familiar with those words or has not bothered to practice the speech before delivering it. That is the best I can do in answering this question. ",

So even when professionals write speeches for him, his flights of fancy take over and away he goes, telling us of his incredible accomplishments and what a great president he is. Really? Yes, his daily goal using his limited vocabulary is to make himself appear to be the yugeist, most bigly president we ever had. ",
