            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to take a wild guess here and assume you\u2019re trying to get into grad school. Somebody has told you that having publications helps, and you\u2019ve got six months before you\u2019ll be sending in your applications. Did I get that right? You have no chance of doing useful research on your own in the next six months. You have to do what every other student does: find a faculty advisor who mentors undergrads and who has a project you can join. When talking to potential faculty mention that you\u2019d like to have a publication \u201cin submission\u201d in six months. ",

            "answer_text": "I recently did a project with an undergraduate student. We did the work together in 1 month and finished the MS 2 weeks later and submitted it. 4 months later we are still waiting for referee\u2019s comments. It can be done in 6 months. However, I have published 88 papers. Experience is needed in knowing what to do, graphing and analysing the data and writing the thing. My first paper was single authored and took about 1 year to publish. Try and do what you can alone or with a single mentor. Ability in science though is largely innate and you either have it or you do not. Be careful about double publication. If you present it as a conference paper you may have difficulty publishing the material in an ISI rated journal. You will need advice about bad journals. Find out about Beall\u2019s list. ",
