            "answer_text": "Are you too old to read the books? Hmm let\u2019s see\u2026 Are you too old and scared to visit 4 Private Drive alone in the midnight on a day when He who must not be named was defeated, because if you are don\u2019t worry you will find Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall waiting for you there. Would you like to find out the actual reason why Harry was allowed the visit the zoo on Dudley\u2019s birthday, or do you want to believe that they took Harry with them everywhere they went. Would you like to relive that moment when Harry sets the boa free or are you too old and maybe scared to think about a free boa roaming around. Would you like to find out to what extent Vernon went to make sure Harry doesn\u2019t find out that he\u2019s a wizard. Would you like to find out how Harry met his arch rival (if arch rivals exists) or you are too old to accept that they met on the stairs of Hogwarts. Do you want to find about Peeves? Ofcourse you don\u2019t know who he was because maybe you are thinking if you are too old for such folly. Oh my sweet summer child!! (Yes, big fan of ASOIAF), it\u2019s like you have been shown through a keyhole that on the other side lies that magical world you have been desperately dying to get a feel of ever since you saw the young Harry cross the barrier to 9 and 3 quaters platform, and you are wondering if you are too old to summon your strength to push the door wide open. Let me ask you how did you felt that time when you saw on the big screen Harry visiting Ollivanders to buy his wand or when he went to save the Sorcerer\u2019s stone? It was good, sorry my bad, it was Damn good and you had to hold your nerves before shouting \u201cBe careful Harry\u201d. Now how would you like to join him on his journey and be with him as a part of him, buying the wand, getting Hedwig and going to Hogwarts. Would you like to be a part of the Golden Trio? Listen to their secret discussions while they use the Muffliato charm, oh but you don\u2019t know what that charm does\u2026. Sad life\u2026 You have my sympathy.  How much would you like to be with them when they enter the Chamber of Secrets, or when they take detours at night along with the Marauders map, going into the Shrieking Shack or finding out that there are 7 secret passages that leads from Hogwarts to Hogsmead. How would you like to meet all the members of Order of the Pheonix, or I might daresay the person who could have been the Chosen One instead of Harry \u2026.Oh now you didn\u2019t knew that \u2026 But ofcourse Dumbledore was secretive, wasn\u2019t he\u2026 You are missing quite a huge portion of the thing that you has left you with the belief that Yes, ofcourse it\u2019s happening in your mind, but why on earth does it mean that it isn\u2019t real. Or are you too old for embarking a journey that will leave you ecstatic?? Oh and for the record, I am 20 years old and I first read the books when I was 15. In the past few years I have read the books more number of times than I care to count, recently I finished the set ( Soft-copies) and I am looking forward to buy the hard copies. \u201cHappiness can be found even in the darkest of hours only if one remembers to put on the light\u201d And there\u2019s nothing better than the books to shed light on the things that were not covered in the movies\u2026. Have a Great time reading them!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Ana! My granddaughter who is a 20 year old University student has read, and this is no exaggeration, every Harry Potter book at least 20 times, maybe more. Each book! She\u2019s speaking to me about it as I write this. She said she just read The Deathly Hallows again a few days ago! Her favorite is The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone because it sets the stage for all the books that followed, but she says \u201cthey are all awesome!\u201d So, to answer your question, you are not too old to read the Harry Potter books and read them over and over again if you wish. She says \u201cIf you love Harry Potter you will definitely love the Inheritance Cycle\u201d written by Christopher Paolini. I\u2019ve taken a pic snippet of the book titles and genre from wikipedia. According to the website: \u201cThe Inheritance Cycle is a young adult tetralogy of epic fantasy novels written by American author Christopher Paolini. Set in the fictional world of Alaga\u00ebsia (/\u00e6l\u0259\u02c8\u0261e\u026azi\u0259/), the novels focus on the adventures of a teenage boy named Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, as they struggle to overthrow the evil king Galbatorix. \u201d [1]  I hope this helps you and I hope you will decide to read each Harry Potter book. If you love this genre then I think you will love the Inheritance Cycle too. Enjoy! Carol Edited: I goofed. Wrote \u201cDeadly\u201d Hallows. My Granddaughter just corrected me: it\u2019s \u201cDeathly\u201d Hallows. I\u2019ll probably be exiled for making such an egregious error. :-) Footnotes[1] Inheritance Cycle - Wikipedia",
