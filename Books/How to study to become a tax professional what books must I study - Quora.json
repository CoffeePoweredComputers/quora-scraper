            "answer_text": "(USA) How to study to become a tax preparer? When I had a practice, I would send new employees to the H&R Block courses. Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax Service also have classes. And after I retired, I participated in the VITA program and they also had a short class (IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program). The only way to learn how to prepare tax returns is to do it. Classes mainly teach vocabulary, a little theory, and perhaps how to use software. In accounting firms, employees check each other\u2019s work. In my first job with a CPA firm, five employees worked in a large room. We could ask others about problems we encountered, and we asked questions as we checked another\u2019s work. Then one of the partners (who had private offices to interview clients) reviewed the return. Most of the tax returns were of small business owners. But we did interview some individual clients with small tax returns in the large office, which was sometimes humorous. One woman brought her stuff in and Charles was going over her records. He came across three payments/receipts to the same medical clinic. Often we encountered clients who turned over both canceled checks and receipts for the same transaction so we had to match them up. Well, she freely told Charles that the payments were for abortions, which was TMI because we didn\u2019t care as long as it was for a medical purpose. But she thought we would think less of her for having so many abortions in a single year, so she explained that two of the procedures were for her teenage daughters. One farmer brought his records to us in a five-gallon pickle jar every year. So we purchased a cardboard organizer with a sliding drawer about the size of a filing cabinet drawer, along with some folders labeled with various farming expenses. The partner carefully explained to the farmer that it was a gift and that the cost was not included in the bill. The next year he brought the organizer back and we silently cheered. But when we opened it, there was the pickle jar. Practice makes perfect, or so they say. And the only real way to learn how to prepare tax returns is to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the best way is to find another professional to help you in earlier years. To mentor, to work with or under, to at least be able to go to with questions. Join professional organizations like NATP or one that supports your designation if you have one. (NAEA, AICPA). When they are available again, attend live events for education or networking. The strange thing that helped me the most, close to 10 years ago now, was getting a job as a support person for a major software company. Answering all of the questions people had (and being required to look up the answers myself in most cases) taught me more in a few years than I think I could have learned in a decade of practice. The volume of questions is far more than you would see only working on your own returns in your office, and it really expanded my knowledge base and my professional network. ",
