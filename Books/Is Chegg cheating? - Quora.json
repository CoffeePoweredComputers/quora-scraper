            "answer_text": "Mostly, yes (it is cheating and you shouldn\u2019t do it). It is also the worst way to study. At least in mathematics (I teach mathematics), homework exercises are precisely that. Exercises. Using chegg is like going to the gym to watch other people exercise. Actually worse, you are paying others to exercise in front of you and then telling other people that you have exercised. Notice that your college football team doesn\u2019t pay someone else to train instead of them so that they don\u2019t have to spend all that boring time training. And yes, it is cheating. You are supposed to work on homework/take-home exams/etc. on your own, at best get help and hints during office hours. Getting complete solutions means you will not learn anything. Someone saying that this is the only way to pass classes is downright stupid. It is the only way to learn nothing and possibly get a reasonable grade, be lost in higher classes, and at some point get prosecuted for cheating and possibly thrown out of the university. People went to universities, and learned before Chegg. Having been teaching for the past two decades at various universities, the classes where availability of solutions to homework problems was limited or nonexistent, produced much better outcomes for the students (based on exam scores). In the pre-chegg era, I once taught the same class with the same textbook in two semesters in sequence. The first semester I assigned the book homework, and found that students ended up using the solutions manual (they managed to find the \u201cteacher version\u201d of that). The second time I taught it, same book, but now I assigned homework I made up, for which there were no solutions. There was more grumbling from the students, but the scores on the exams ended up being about 10% better on average. Yes that is anecdotal evidence. But, just like the gym. Going and having someone lift weights for you isn\u2019t going to do much. Yes, solving problems on your own hurts. It is frustrating. And it takes a LOT of time. But that\u2019s the only way you will actually learn it well. Going to chegg and giving them money to solve problems for you, is a colossal waste of time and money. Why are you going to the university at all? ",

            "answer_text": "So here are some secrets from working at Chegg: Universities are not perfect.The business model for solutions only works for cattle call classes where you have 100s of students in the same course. It also only works for STEM, because there has to be a \u201cright answer\u201d.TAs are often overloaded, but spend most of their time helping students doing the homework. Same with professors.TAs and professors have office hours during well, office hours. Students work on their homework after dinner, which is not during office hours.Solution manuals are often available for the textbook.Some professors have embraced the existence of Chegg, and guided their students to use it so that they don\u2019t have to explain how to do the problems, and then assign different problems on the tests, because the purpose of homework is not to be a puzzle, but to give STEM students practice.Given all that, using Chegg Textbook Solutions is often the only way to get to through the class. Is it a cheat if your university has allocated a bunch of money to their diversity bureaucrats so they can\u2019t afford more TAs for these core courses? Is it a cheat that TAs don\u2019t want to have office hours at 2AM when you\u2019re stuck on a Physics problem? Is it a cheat when you work in a study group and a friend or a more senior student helps you do the problem? No its not a cheat. It\u2019s a tool. ",
