            "answer_text": "One might prefer \u201chow does a writer decide,\u201d vs. \u201cdecides\u201d as being slightly more grammatical. But, hey, grammar is . . . flexible. That said, once the writer has established the character and set him or her in motion, that character will behave \u2018in character.\u2019 If he or she is a thoughtful, intelligent and kind individual, he or she will behave accordingly. If another kind of person, expect appropriate reflexes. Leopards don\u2019t change their spots. John Fowles once expressed himself as mystified by how his characters behaved, though he was writing their stories. They did what they had to do, he explained. This reflects some of the wonder and mystery of writing, in which \u2018things happen\u2019 beyond the writer\u2019s control or understanding. But the behavior must be in character. Or, as I have explained it with an aphorism: \u201cHabits create character, and character determines destiny.\u201d Say it isn\u2019t so, I dare you. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, you take ages planning the character, then you choose the plot, then the character will be themselves in the given situation. THEN REWRITES. Just leaving it at the beginning means that you might be unfair to your characters. However, basically, character and plot should be interwoven and situation i.e. conflict is part of plot - so if you\u2019re writing well the character behaves in the situation either based on the fact that they\u2019ve caused the situation or they\u2019ve ended up in the situation, then their mood will be informed by what kind of character they are. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault this is happening\u201d - nervous, neurotic character, \u201cThis isn\u2019t my fault\u201d - stubborn, \u201cNice.\u201d - arrogant. Then their mood should inform their actions. So nervous character might bite their nails, stubborn character might dig their feet into the ground and damage relationships with other characters and arrogant character might cause more situations for the fun of it.
