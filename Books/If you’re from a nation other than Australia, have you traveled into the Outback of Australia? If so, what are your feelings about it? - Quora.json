            "answer_text": "I\u2019m originally from England, but have been in Australia for a long time. During that time I have travelled over much of Australia including what most would term as the outback. To be fair, most of it was on made roads, though a lot of it was on dirt roads. My wife and I spent a year driving around Australia with a caravan (travel trailer), returning to towns and cities only to buy food and fuel and visit friends and family. i heard quite a few tourists complaining about the distance between attractions, places where there was nothing. We probably like the \u201cnothing\u201d as much, if not more, than the attractions. My view is that it is the space around things that gives them their form. I love the outback areas passionately, the colours are amazing from the reds if the centre combined with an amazingly blue sky, to the muted colours which can be found round the next bend or in the next valley. I love the range of scenery from the mountains to the desert, and I love that it\u2019s not full of fences and houses. I also love that it is dangerous and deserted. People do die out there from not understanding the rules. they\u2019re fairly simple. Don\u2019t be stupid. If your car is stuck, stay with it. Let people know where you are going. Be prepared. Those rules are mainly for the off the beaten track type tourists, but some of the outback roads require serious preparation. ",

Flying for hours on end - in a small plane on a compass bearing - waiting to pick up the next ADF beacon - can be a little scary. (Of course that was before GPS)Even on a commercial flight to Asia from the East Coast - you fly for 5 hours over nothing but desert.It is truly a massive and desolate country. ",
