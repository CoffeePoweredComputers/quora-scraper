            "answer_text": "Bhagavt geetha as we find today is a modified one only. for example 13th chapter was not there when adhi shankara wrote his bhashyam. Now some one has inserted. what they inserted additionally we dont know But rest assured. whosoever did this insertion, they have only elucidated the theme of geetha further. So no need to fret about  it The  best according to me is Chinmayanandha's The Holy Gheetha. He explains Gheetha according to todays requirements. I will give you one example. Krishan says that by rainfall all the beings are benefitting. and rainfall occurs by yagyam. Taken blindly yagyam would mean a religious ritual in which ghee is poured with brahmins chanting mantras.  But Chinmayananda explains this ritual with reference to todays context. He says yagya means, yagya  spirit. An yagya is a ritual performed for the benefit of the community, each member contributing whatever they can and the result was enjoyed equally by everybody, irrespective of their contribution. So, this stanza means, that we must do our work selflessly for the benefit of the  community and results will occur naturally. Please take your time, read it stanza by stanza and digest it.Never attempt to memorise it. no good will happen by memorising the user manual of a car, you must follow the instructions and drive the car accordingly Gheetha is a user manual of life.

            "answer_text": "Thanks to Murari for his lucid answer. I want to add that the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, by AC. Bhaktivedanta Swami is the only edition of the Gita on the planet with authorized purports from one of 4 original sampradayas in this world. The explanations by Srila Prabhupada are even more important for understanding the text than the slokas themselves. Krishna says: Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.(Bg. 4.34) Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine. (Bg. 4.35) Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries. (Bg. 4.36) As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities. (Bg. 4.37) In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has become accomplished in the practice of devotional service enjoys this knowledge within himself in due course of time. (Bg. 4.38) A faithful man who is dedicated to transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses is eligible to achieve such knowledge, and having achieved it he quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace. (Bg. 4.39) But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not attain God consciousness; they fall down. For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in this world nor in the next. (Bg. 4.40) ",
