            "answer_text": "First on the list of books for those interested in a career in politics, The Prince by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, then The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Both of these are very short books but their content, although hundreds of years old, takes many re-readings to grasp. I\u2019d also recommend My Life by President Bill Clinton and All the President\u2019s Men by Woodward and Bernstein. Also important is Robert Caro\u2019s The Power Broker, his exhaustive study of Robert Moses, and perhaps even more important his four volumes on Lyndon Johnson: The Path to Power, Means of Ascent, Master of the Senate, and The Passage to Power. Caro\u2019s Johnson books are almost as great a commitment to readers as they were to the author but they detail how a man who was literally digging ditches in order to survive, used his experience at a teacher\u2019s college to develop a theory of American politics that not only made him Speaker of the House but the only man in history, before or since, to make the US senate function correctly. The last volume explains the calculations that Johnson made that would lead him to the presidency and what he did as president that enabled him to move bills languishing in the House for three years, through Congress in three months. These books are not a paean to Johnson. They describe his problems and faults in great detail. But they also explain what a shrewd man with a mediocre education can accomplish which greater men cannot, and the elements in his life that drove him to accomplish them. ",
