            "answer_text": "Well yeah. That's exactly what happened with Superman Prime One Million  After everyone he could possibly love died on Earth, he spent 15,000 years in the sun. His powers grew exponentially to the point that he's off the charts. He's also been to LITERALLY Heaven and Hell and whatever else. He's even gone beyond the source wall and back and came back with knowledges that are far beyond anything anyone has ever seen. Using these powers he's been able to resurrect the dead and even create his own universe where he served as its protector and God. So yeah, spending time in the sun could definitely make him omnipotent. Now you could argue that this is just Superman Prime One Million and therefore not canon. But guess what? Recently he's sun dipped several suns and was powerful enough to K.O the World Forget, a 6th dimensional being who could literally create entire universes. But all accounts, a 6th dimenaional being should be absolutely untouchable for a mere 3rd dimensional being. But not only did Supes touch him, he K.O'd him. Even broke a piece of the universe that he had created off. And that's canon. So yeah. I think that with enough expose to sunlight, Superman could indeed be omnipotent. ",

            "answer_text": "No. You see this guy?  He could gain all the power in the multiverse, he could absorb infinite stars, increasing his power to super duper infinite+++++++ x 1488393030495848 ultra level. But he\u2019ll never be omnipotent. Omnipotent means you can do anything, ANYTHING. Which means an omnipotent person can defeat a penguin by eating a pineapple on a Wednesday, causing time dilation on Mars, thereby exciting an elephant. That sentence made no sense, but an omnipotent character can do that. When Superman star dips his power, strength, speed and durability increase by insane amounts. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to gain the power to blink so chocolate-like that a math equation cries. There\u2019s a big difference between omnipotence and every other magnitude of power. Omnipotence is only surpassed by one thing, which is of course, Santa\u2019s beard.  Santa knows what\u2019s up.  Thanks for reading! And be sure to leave a 500 page essay detailing why I\u2019m ignorant in the comments below, I\u2019ll definitely read it. ",
