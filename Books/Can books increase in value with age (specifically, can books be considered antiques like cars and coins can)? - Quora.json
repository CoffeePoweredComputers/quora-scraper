            "answer_text": "Books can increase in value with age, certainly. The real measure of the value of a book lies in its rarity, how well known it became, and in the author who wrote it (or if it won any prizes like a Pulitzer, etc). The first edition of a title can have more value as can an author-signed book. The first book by an author who later became famous and very well known can be valuable as the first book was most likely not published in any great quantity. Very old books can have value both due to the age of the book but also due to the rarity of the book in today\u2019s world. ",
