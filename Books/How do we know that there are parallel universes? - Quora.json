            "answer_text": "Q: How do we know that there are parallel universes? A: We don\u2019t. We hypothesise that there may be parallel universes. Not only that, but there are several different models of parallel universes from different fields, like predecessor universes (predecessor black hole model, big crunch model, conformal cyclic cosmology) in cosmology, separate timelines (many worlds interpretation) from quantum mechanics, other universes separate from ours (string landscape, Hubble volumes, eternal inflation model) from cosmology or string theory, and so on. The sad thing is that most of these models are either impossible to test because of the speed of light, or dependent on a piece in physics that we don\u2019t have. Most ideas from cosmology would require a theory of everything which combines quantum mechanics and general relativity, and such a theory doesn\u2019t exist yet. The others would require us to travel or communicate faster than light to detect them. Not even the model that is most likely to be true, the Hubble volume model, is testable. The Hubble volume model suggest that beyond the edge of this piece of the universe that we can observe, called \u201cthe observable universe\u201d, there are other such bubbles of observable universes, which may or may not overlap with this one. Since they are separated from us by the age of the universe and the speed of light, they can\u2019t affect us and we can\u2019t affect them \u2013 so for all practical purposes and intents, those bubbles could be seen as another universe. Of course, not everyone agrees to that this is another universe, because it would be a part of this one that we just can\u2019t reach.  Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. And because of the speed of light, we can\u2019t test even this model. We would have to go faster than light to another location outside the observable universe and see if there is more universe over there. It ought to be true, no matter if you view those other bubbles as its own universe, but we can\u2019t test it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many theories have been proposed for existence of parallel universes: 1. Infinite universes. We don't know what the shape of space-time is exactly. One prominent theory is that it is flat and goes on forever. This would present the possibility of many universes being out there. But with that topic in mind, it's possible that universes can start repeating themselves. That's because particles can only be put together in so many ways. More about that in a moment. 2. Bubble universes. Another theory for multiple universes comes from \"eternal inflation.\" Based on some research , when looking at space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating like the Big Bang inflated our own universe. Others, however, will keep getting larger. So if we picture our own universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. What's interesting about this theory is the other universes could have very different laws of physics than our own, since they are not linked. 3. Daughter universes. Or perhaps multiple universes can follow the theory of quantum mechanics (how subatomic particles behave), as part of the \"daughter universe\" theory. If you follow the laws of probability, it suggests that for every outcome that could come from one of your decisions, there would be a range of universes \u2014 each of which saw one outcome come to be. 4. Mathematical universes. Another possible avenue is exploring mathematical universes, which, simply put, explain that the structure of mathematics may change depending in which universe you reside. \"A mathematical structure is something that you can describe in a way that's completely independent of human baggage. 5. Parallel universes. And last but not least as the idea of parallel universes. Going back to the idea that space-time is flat, the number of possible particle configurations in multiple universes would be limited to 10^10^122 distinct possibilities, to be exact. So, with an infinite number of cosmic patches, the particle arrangements within them must repeat \u2014 infinitely many times over. This means there are infinitely many \"parallel universes\": cosmic patches exactly the same as ours (containing someone exactly like you), as well as patches that differ by just one particle's position, patches that differ by two particles' positions, and so on down to patches that are totally different from ours so thats something like infinite in number.
