            "answer_text": "If you want to announce when you publish a book, or similar subjects on Quora, the best way to do so is on a personal Quora Blog you create for the purpose. Be clear that you are the author of the book(s): Quora is very strict about full disclosure, and promoting your book without revealing you wrote it can lead to moderation action. Likewise, it is best to name your book, rather than linking to your website directly. Quora tends to dislike any external links that are not required by the content, so if you are concerned about your content being reported as spam, one of the easiest steps you can take is to not use any URLs. Beyond that, when appropriate, you can use parts of your book as examples when answering questions, as long as you: Reveal that it was written by youDon\u2019t include links, ANDUse it to answer a question in a meaningful wayYou can even quote passages from your book, as long as you use the block quoting function, and include proper attribution. Say you wrote a book that was a Romance novel that explored a love affair set in France under Napoleon. You see a question asking about how to write historical novels in Napoleonic France. You can definitely use your novel as an example, as long as your answer answers the question fully, on Quora, in your answer. Note: Saying merely \u201cI wrote about this in book X\u201d, and leaving the answer at that without explaining, is not an acceptable answer. Likewise, \u201cI write about this subject in my blog\u201d is not acceptable by itself, but it is an acceptable lead in to an in depth explanation, which may quote from your blog or book. All answers need to answer the question without requiring going to another website, or reading a book. The answer must be here, on Quora, in your answer. Blogs are for your personal announcements, and are the best option for those. If you have expertise, which can include having written books on a subject, you can share that expertise, and mention books you have written, when the act of sharing helps readers of your Answer understand the Answer and its Question better.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure you can. The fact is, Quora (and many other sites like it) endorse a free-speech environment (as they should, in my opinion), and as with any online forum, unbalanced and angry people tend to become quite animated in their hatred through their responses to you. This is unfortunate, because it is my experience that such condemnation has little or nothing to do with the person they are spewing said hatred at. For this reason, I\u2019m a big fan of the \u201cblock\u201d feature. I always tell friends that they should surround themselves with people who are supportive and positive. I think this policy definitely applies when you\u2019re looking for feedback on your efforts on Quora or with friends or anywhere, really. There are also online CMS/blog sites, like Tumblr and WordPress, which are especially supportive for writers. At WordPress, in particular, I\u2019ve gathered extremely helpful feedback on my writing (both criticisms and praise) from some very talented, experienced and dedicated individuals. There are plenty of people there who have gathered feedback from other writers throughout the entirety of their book-writing process with considerable success. I think it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019ve accomplished something so difficult! Congratulations! ",
