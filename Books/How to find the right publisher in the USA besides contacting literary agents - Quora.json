            "answer_text": "As Mark Thompson points out in his answer, it\u2019s usually best to seek out an agent to connect you with the right publisher. But your question seems to indicate you\u2019re already aware of this and you want other options, so let\u2019s look at your two primary avenues: Network with published authors and people in the publishing business. You can do this online, of course, but in person is ideal (if possible). There are many writing and publishing conferences, which offer, more or less, opportunities to meet and interact with authors and others in the book business. For example, Digital Book World and IBPA\u2019s Publishing University are two annual events that will put you in with people in the corporate and indie publishing field. Likewise, be sure to search online for local and regional conferences and associations. IBPA has a number of affiliate associations throughout the U.S., one of which I ran for several years. It was a phenomenal networking and learning forum that I enjoyed as much as our author and publisher members. Again, be sure to focus on places where you\u2019ll interact with people who can help you get where you want to go \u2014 published authors and publishing professionals. There\u2019s nothing wrong with spending time with fellow aspiring authors, but be sure most of your time is spent with people who are ahead of you in the process, for learning and connections. Buy a copy of Writer\u2019s Market 2019. It\u2019s available, of course, on Amazon, but many libraries also carry a copy. Just be sure to get the current edition since the information can get very dated. Study the advice in the book thoroughly, and then apply its guidance to pursue the publishers in the book that are the best fit for you and your manuscript. (You\u2019ll probably want your own copy instead of one from the library because you\u2019re likely to want to make many notes in it.) You\u2019re smart to know you want/need the \u201cright publisher\u201d as this is a significant relationship you\u2019ll be entering into \u2014 and not all publishers/authors are right for each other. Some authors want/need a smaller publisher with a personal touch, while others will be better with a larger publisher. And then there\u2019s the fit as it relates to your book/manuscript/proposal. As Mark Thompson alludes to in his answer, it\u2019s difficult to have your choice of publishers. But it\u2019s not impossible. If you target publishers that are the best fit for you and your project, you\u2019ll be more likely to have a choice. Thanks for the A2A!

            "answer_text": "There are three ways to publish in the US today\u2014traditionally, with a Top 10 Press (these are the Big 5, three largest independents, Algonquin, Sourcebooks, and Kensington, plus two non-fiction publishers); traditionally with a small or micro press; or as an indie- or self-published author. If you want a deal with a Top 10, you pretty much need an agent. Some of the imprints at a Big 5 have windows where they take a look at the so-called slush, and occasionally an email query to one of the independents garners a response, but the chances of getting an offer this way are microscopic. (Getting an offer is tough even with an agent). If you want to publish with a small, new, or micro press, you can approach them without an agent. Do your research to find ones that publish what you write, caveat emptor since some of them are inexperienced, shutter unexpectedly, and the like, and know that you are giving up a large percentage of sales (which may be low) without getting the distribution and reach that makes publishing traditionally advantageous over self-publishing. Good luck! ",
