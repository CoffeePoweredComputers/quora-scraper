            "answer_text": "Right now just understand the story and do not try to understand each and every word. Who is the story about? What does she do? Where does she live and which period? how is life in that period ? What is special in this story? Initially if you understand this much, you have done a good job. Then reread the book after 3 or 6 months but before reading it again read the reviews of other people for the book. Understand what special they have found in this book and why this book is considered a classic. For now just keep reading and understand the story and that is more than enough. ",
