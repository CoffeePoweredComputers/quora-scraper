            "answer_text": "It is a very good book for anyone who is looking at bringing positive changes in their lives. The book describes with real life examples on the 7 habits. Somewhere in the book, it is also mentioned that most self help books will always involve one or more of these 7 habits in some form. And I must say, I found that to be true. I had read another book soon after I finished this one, and I felt that the latter was repeating the same points as 7 habits, albeit in a different order and in that author's own style. (Again, each person will have an affinity to certain styles of speaking/writing more than others) So in summary, it is a good book to start your journey of self development no matter what age, and the book will be effective only if you implement the principles in daily life ",
