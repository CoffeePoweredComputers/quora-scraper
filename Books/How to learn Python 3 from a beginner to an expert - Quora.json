            "answer_text": "If you have SOME experience in programming in ANY language (even BASIC), then the documentation is more than enough to learn the basics. I personally think that Python is the most meticulously documented programming language in existence. The documentation takes you right from being a beginner in the language to an expert. But if you want to start from scratch, there are a couple more ways to go. If you want to learn by doing Okay. The heading is a bit misleading, because, whatever method you choose always learn by doing. I can't stress this point enough. What I mean here, anyway, is if you want to learn Python by programming in an online environment already set up for you, you can try Python Programming track at codecademy.If you like to learn by reading (and doing)If you are the book-y kind, point number one, don't go for O'Reilly books. They are great and all, but when it comes to Python, they just suck the beauty out of things you can do with the language. Instead I'd like to recommend three books, which are available online for free.Learn Python The Hard Way, by Zed A. ShawDive Into Python 3, by Mark PilgrimA Byte of Python, by Swaroop CHNow how to choose between them? I say just try the first few chapters of any of those books and if you like it, continue with it, and if you do not, jump into another book. There are tons of other great books out there too. If you are not satisfied with these, do a little exploration on your own. If you like to learn by watching (and doing)There are many good video tutorial series on YouTube. Here, let me show you a couple. Python 3.4 Programming Tutorials by Bucky/thenewbostonPython 3 Basics Tutorial Series by SentdexAgain, to choose between them, use the same procedure that I described to choose between the books. After completing any of these, and if you're feeling comfy with the basics of the language, go through the documentation too. If you are interested in testing your skills, go to this brilliant online treasure hunt, The Python Challenge. It is pretty cool. Going beyond the basics Python is a very versatile language. You can bend it to your way. As Jessica McKellar aptly puts it, Python is a choose-your-own adventure! With just the basics with you, sadly, you won't be able to do much. What makes Python such an awesome language for the real-world are external libraries that uses Python. Needless to say, you will need those basics with you to learn these libraries. Some of the most popular libraries are given below: PyGame, a game development library, lets you make cool gamesDjango, a web-application framework, if you want to make a websiteFlask (A Python Microframework), another popular web-application framework, a little more down-to-earth (and thus more flexible) approach to web app developmentOpenCV, a Computer Vision library, gives you the power of image manipulation! Pretty cool, eh?SimpleCV, another CV library, essentially a subset of OpenCV, but has a much lower learning curveRaspberry Pi, is basically a credit-card sized single board computers (but much more) which uses Python as its main languageTo learn most of these libraries, the documentation will be enough, although there are tons of resources to help you out there. A very helpful tip: use the powerful combination of Google and Stack Overflow, when in doubt. The odds are that the problem bugging you has been already faced and solved by the community. for more you can follow my website Code basics ",

Like any other art-form, you can start programming as a beginner and become an expert in any programming language you choose. You may start with understanding the essence of solving real-life problems by utilizing the functional prowess and ease of integration with extensive platforms. Python in this regard is a piece of technical art. You may learn Python 3 the same way, you would learn an art-form. Beginning to learn is never a road-block. With continuous dedication and creative use of the art-form, you become an expert. To provide a tiny push to your motivation, look at the applications that have been built using python below.  To add up, there is an extensive bunch of resources available online in both self-paced and instructor-paced mediums here: Python Certification Course | Python Training. You may choose a step-wise learning path that allows you to assess the skills you learn. Reference to learning path here: How To Become A Python Developer | Learning Path For Python. To navigate through the waters of Python programs and become an expert, consider reading and practicing as much as you can. Remember, the more you code and try, the better will your understanding of Python scripting will be.
