            "answer_text": "Technically this is a question for your publisher, who will do a clearance check on your book before they publish it making sure that you are not doing anything illegal. If you have a quote, they are going to take steps to make sure it is either a fair use or that you have permission. Or if you are self-publishing, work with an editor to make sure the above happens before you publish. But the short answer to a really complex issue is that: it depends. You told us nothing of the source of the quote. Some are usable, some aren\u2019t. You told us nothing about how you are using it. Is this a use that falls under criticism, review, or parody? Is this an academic use where you are substantiating an assertion in your book? We know nothing about what sort of book you are writing: text book, novel, cookbook? A place where you would fail without permission is a use in fiction where you quote a line from a book or poem at the start of a chapter to set the tone. For that you need permission, because that is not fair use. But again, work with an editor\u2014or better, a publisher\u2014to resolve issues like this AFTER you have written the book. Writing a book is hard enough already, stop making problems for yourself during the creation process and just write the damn thing. ",
