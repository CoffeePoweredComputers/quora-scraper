            "answer_text": "No, it's not important.  There's no higher authority that sits to adjudicate your reading choices. No one judges you for what you read, unless you let them.  Let's make the allowance for clubbing a whole plethora of literature as classics. Firstly, let me just get this out of the way - not all old books are good books, not all new books are bad books. What's special about classics? Many classics are universal stories, about adventure and the human condition that are still unparalleled in their characterizations, situations and/or use of language. Classics tell stories that have endured the test of time, and are often retold or remade in modern contexts. Some easy examples are Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and other Shakespearean plays that are adapted ad nauseum. The Count of Monte Cristo has such a solid foundation of entertainment that it is retold in many forms, especially film. Adventure stories from the Victorian Era capture the essence of the Age of Discovery that carries whiffs of a bygone era, the likes of which we'll never see again. Hype and over-hype - not everyone has to enjoy or read the same things. Some people genuinely love some things, and praise them. Other people attribute all sorts of connotations to those things, and they take a life of their own. For example, Quora has acquired a \"cerebral\" image in the gamut of social networks that exist today, especially in India. This is mostly fostered by the highbrow critics that are to be found at undergraduate institutions of our country. Others may see it differently. Similarly, sometimes classics take on an air of being hard-to-read, or aspirational. It is always up to the individual whether or not to go by that perceived hype. Eventually, the litmus test of deciding whether something is over-hyped or not can only be performed after first giving it a shot. I have read mostly what would be construed as classics all my life, and almost entirely fiction. I go for only three things in a book - entertainment, entertainment, entertainment. Life's too short and there's too much to read. I must say that the only couple of books I left halfway after starting were by modern authors. The writing was too stylized and I couldn't find a story to connect too. Not all good classics are well known. I have discovered unhyped classics too, books that were all but forgotten, and which deserved to be better known. In that sense, no, not all classics are hyped, let alone over-hyped. I just cannot relate to reading something without being personally invested in doing so. Thus, I cannot read a book just because someone recommended it, or just because there's \"hype\" around it. If you make your reading decisions based on these things, do not fear. Here are some recommendations for new readers to make good reading choices to develop \"cerebral\" approaches to reading, in my answer to What are the best books that every college-going student should read? I've tried to include many genres of books, from mythology and short stories to adventure and dystopia. Everyone ought to be able to find something to relate to here. The trope that classics are difficult to read is just too presumptuous and needs to go. Not all classics are created equal. Shakespearean English is different from Jane Austen's English. Translated works of Jules Verne and Alexander Dumas are perhaps \"easier\" reads than a lot of Dickens who wrote in serial form. If you consider early 1900's books as classics, you would find the language different too. However, if you really are genuinely curious about the story, and find the language a barrier, please don't give up on the book! Believe me, there are other ways. Find a good abridgement. Not all abridged versions are created equal either! We read classics for English Literature at school, and only after graduating did I realize that what we had read were really good abridged versions. The key thing they did was, they preserved some original dialogue, so that the unique turns of phrase gave an air of authenticity. In general, finding abridged versions that are taught at school would be a good idea to get a \"feel\" for the times and the setting. You can read more about reading classics in abridged forms here, in my answer to Where can I find well written summaries of some good books?  What's the point of reading these? Absolutely no point whatsoever if you're doing it for some imaginary hype. If the book catches your attention, if the story summary on the back cover sounds interesting, if you saw or read a retelling somewhere in the form of a movie, play or graphic novel, it might give you the right kind of impetus to go ahead and give it a shot.  At the end of the day, let's all read what we enjoy, and let's not begrudge others their choices. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer to that question would be: No. It's not really necessary to read the classics unless you are in a related field such as English literature (I am only going to talk about English classics here) or philology. There are many great works of fiction available in modern era too.  The reason that the classics are still so loved, revered, and read is simply that they are great works of fiction. They are still relevant in many ways that some mediocre works of modern fiction aren't. That's not to say that everything penned during that era was gold. There must have been many incompetant authors back then too. When we talk about classics, we are talking about approximately 2-3 % of the total works of the previous eras that survived the travails of time. Another reason - and it's a bit unfair one - is that a lot of classics are original works. They are a tribute to the human imagination and creativity. For instance, a lot of Jules Verne's works described contraptions and engineering that were at least half a century away from being conceptualized. Everything that came after those classics in that particular genre was directly or indirectly influenced by the original work. That's not to say that someone else wouldn't have figured it out later. But, tt's just the way some things work. If Wilhelm Roentgen hadn't dicsovered unknown waves of radiation - that he later named X-Rays - someone else might have later as humankind gained more knowledge about the nature of radiation. But, as history would have it, he became the first one to stumble upon the phenomenon. Similarly, if Bram Stoker hadn't dreamt up of a Count who can transform into a bat and likes to quench his thirst with some good ol' human blood, someone else might have (for all you know, it might have been Stephanie Meyer; how would you have felt about classics then?). The classics also provide a glimpse into the era during which they were written, while portraying some really progressive thinking which might not have been prevalent during that particular era. They also provide instances of characters and, at time authors, breaking the mould. In an era when horror fiction was popularly considered the sole domain of male writers, Mary Shelley wrote the story of a reanimated monster created by a young scientist named Victor Frankenstein.  The point that you make about the language is a fair one if you are not into reading the language of that era. Kritika Gupta, in her answer, makes an excellent point about reading the abridged versions. However, I have my reservations about abridged versions. There are a few classics that you may read because the story is just too great to miss out on. However, for certain others, it is the language complemented by the story that makes the books so great. Because, as I mentioned in an earlier point, there are many more imitations - whether intentional or accidental - that have come out later on and you can read those. However, you miss out on the language that made the whole experience so memorable. If the story is a chocolate cake, the language is a dollop of ice cream added on top of it. Language is to the story what honey is to a pancake. Reading a classic without the original language is like listening to Pink Floyd without the guitar solos. If the story is a peek into the culture of the era, the language is a peek into the fabric that held the culture together. And so, I would agree with you to some extent that it is not worth reading most - not all - classics unless you enjoy reading the language. As far as the hype factor is concerned. There are a few classics that you may find over-hyped. But, given the impact that classics have on cultures, we may miss out on the message that the classic delivers since we are not familiar or not a fan of that particular culture. For example, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Great Gatsby are considered American classics. However, I did not enjoy reading those too much. It was only after I read a few reviews written by people originating from those regions or era that I understood why they are so lauded. Similarly, I enjoyed Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn just for the fun factor and the 'loss of innocence' theme, but not for anything else. To conclude, despite all the reasons that I have given for reading classics, I would still reiterate the point that I made early on: the biggest reason to read the classics is the they are, when you come down to it, simply great works of art.
