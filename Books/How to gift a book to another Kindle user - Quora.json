            "answer_text": "If you mean one you've already purchased, you can \"loan\" it to them for 2 weeks if it's eligible for loaning (you can go to \"Manage your kindle\" and click on the title you want to loan. If it's eligible, you can click on the \"Loan this book\" link) or you can just click on the \"Gift as a gift\" link if you're purchasing a new Kindle book. Unfortunately, you can't \"give\" away Kindle books you've purchased for yourself once you're done reading them like you can with a physical book. ",
