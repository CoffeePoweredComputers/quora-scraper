            "answer_text": "Read. That is more important than studying, and it is similar to how you learned to listen to English\u2014by focusing on the meaning and trying to get it from context. This means that you should read things at a level where you can understand most of the general meaning without a dictionary. When you were 2 or 3 or 4 (or 10 or 15) you did not stop to look up words people spoke around you. Soometimes you missed the point. Okay. Gradually you learned, often relying on context. If someone is holding a bottle of milk and asks, \u201cDo you want some milk?\u201d you probably have a good chance of comprehending the meaning, even if you do not know every word. Do that with reading, but find materials at a level that lets you get some enjoyment from the text. If you like sports, start with easy books about sports, and your vocabulary of sports AND OTHER WORDS will build up, along with your knowledge in general. One good idea is to follow a story for several weeks or months. If you start reading about what is happening id Washington or about business or any topic, it isvery hard at first because you do not know the people, the systems them apply, etc. The more you read articles about one thing\u2014maybe international football or American football, the more you will know the vocabulary and much other knowledge that will make new stories easier to follow. Vocabulary and Grammar: As you read, more and more of the basic, and then less basic, words and grammatical forms become \u201cbasic for you\u201d and you have more of your brain left to deal with new words and grammar. Knowledge is needed, too. If I read an advanced physics or medical text, I will understand little even though I was an English professor and my general reading skills are strong. If you are reading a novel about people in a foreign culture, you may not understand their actions because you do not know the cultural rules they live by. Knowledge builds up. Be patient. (For example: \u201c Each one drank some Mao Tai and they ate jiu and shao mai.\u201d Did you understand? They drank a traditional Chinese liquor and ate rice soup and a type of Chinese dumplings. Oh! Sometimes being able to raed the words is not enough. Cultural knowledge and other specialized knowledge will come. Relax. Read. And if you find topics or authors you enjoy. Stick with them for a while. If you are reading in a foreign language, maybe read a book that you already enjoyed in translation in your first language. Try to find things that you WANT to read, and you will read more, and your reading will improve faster. PS: Reading a lot is a key to being a better writer. ",

            "answer_text": " 7 Pleasurable Ways to Improve Your Reading Ability \u201cThere is a total incompatibility between the joy of reading, a vagabond experience, and the experience of reading in order to answer questions, and explain what you understood.\u201d \u2013 Rubem Alves, Brazilian educator. What is most likely to influence your success at school or at a job? The ability to read well. And that goes for your kids too. The declining literacy of our society has been a major concern of educators for a while now, and yet things are not getting better. One reason might be a failure to recognize that reading and literacy are personal skills, best acquired when associated with pleasure. Here are my seven strategies for reading improvement. 1. Read about things that interest you. If you are interested in what you are reading about, the words will come alive, and you will be motivated to understand. You will feel satisfaction in accomplishing a task that you enjoy, and which you consider meaningful. The more you read, the better you will become at reading. Just get started and it will become a habit, as long as you are interested in what you are reading. 2. Read material that is at your level, or just a little difficult for you.Read material that you find easy to read, or just a little challenging. Looking up many unknown words in a conventional dictionary is tedious, and the results of the dictionary search quickly forgotten. It is better to stay within your comfort zone and keep reading. Soon you will be able to take on more difficult content. 3. Learn to read in depth, stay on the same subject for a while. If you are familiar with the subject you are reading about, you will understand better. Do not just read short articles. Commit to books. Stay with one author for at least one book. If the subject matter is new to you, you should even try to read a few different books or articles about the same subject, before you move on. This way you will meet the same vocabulary and ideas often, helping you to learn. You will also be able to get deeper into the subject and your reading confidence will grow. 4. If you have trouble reading, listen first. Many great works of literature were written to be read out loud. Learn to appreciate the art of the narrator. Listen to audio books or audio files of the material that you are reading. This will help make difficult content seem more familiar. If you can hear the new words and phrases that you are reading, you will have an easier time understanding and remembering them. Hearing the rhythm of someone reading a text will help your own reading. 5. Let your imagination get involved. Good readers get engrossed in their reading and let it trigger their imagination. Learn to enjoy your reading without asking too many questions or analyzing too much. It will just spoil the sensual enjoyment of the reading experience. You do not need to predict or analyze. Just enjoy and look forward to absorbing the information, ideas and thoughts expressed by the writer. 6. Don\u2019t worry about what you don\u2019t understand. Most of your reading should be for pleasure. You can enjoy reading without understanding all of what you read. You may even understand some things in your own personal way. Neither you nor a teacher needs to \u201cmonitor\u201d your understanding. Learn to enjoy reading, even while feeling that you do not fully understand or remember what you have read. 7. Recognize that the key is to read a lot. You may develop a system for keeping track of new words that you encounter in your reading, using lists, or Flash Cards, or other memory systems available on the Internet or elsewhere. However, the main growth in your vocabulary and reading skill will come just from reading as much as you can. So learn to enjoy reading and read a lot. Keep reading, and you will become a better reader. Unfortunately not all reading is just for pleasure. When you are reading a textbook or manual, or report or other material that have to read for school or work, you may need to underline, take notes, and read some parts over again, in order to retain what you are reading. However, if you have developed the habit of reading for pleasure, you will find that the cognitive techniques you need will come naturally, and that you will understand a lot better than before. HAPPY READING :)  ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story :\u2014 Long long ago, somewhere far across the land, where the sky ends and the rainbow begins, there lived a little girl. She was very brave and always curious to learn new things. One day, she decided to go to the forest alone, which was forbidden for the kids. She took her arrows and bow, and went straight into it\u2014so as to completely know what is it in there and to improve her archery by practising there in solitude. She had 4 arrows\u2014marked with R, W , L, S. And 1 bow\u2014 marked G. Each arrow had its own special powers and skill requirements to use it. However, there was a condition in learning\u2014 \u201cEither she can master \u2019em all simultaneously or learn nothing!\u201d Slowly and steadily, she started to toil alone with full faith in herself. She learnt to use the arrows, one by one, in rotation\u2014 giving equal importance to each arrow. As the time passed, she moved closer to her dreams, and later, she became the greatest archer of all time.  Similarly, to improve reading and understanding in English\u2014we have got 4 arrows (fields for improvement):\u2014 Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking. Furthermore, we have also got Grammar as our bow (foundation)\u2014 like that little girl.  Moreover, we need to hone our skills (R-W-L-S) simultaneously, because everything is related. If we are able to do it, then the whole journey of learning English (or any other language) would be fun:\u2014 Grammar: It is the foundation of your learning castle (as shown in the diagram). You can\u2019t ignore it and build your castle on a weak foundation. It will eventually fall. Therefore, at least once a week, flip couple of pages of any good English grammar book (say Wren & Martin)\u2014learn the intricacies of the rule(s) by understanding at least one topic thoroughly.Reading: Read. Read. Read. And read even more. Read novels, journals, projects, books, poetry, drama, newspaper\u2014whatever you like. Just read a lot. It is the most effective way to fill the treasure of your vocabulary, word by word; to learn about various ways of putting down one idea in different ways, thought by thought.Writing: Try to write, often. Write anything you like. Write a diary, or some random thoughts on a torn paper, or over here in Quora, or Evernote, or anywhere you find suitable. Writing will help in strengthening the concepts/rules and new words learnt; later, helping you to develop your own writing niche/style.Listening: Listen more, speak less\u2014that\u2019s why I kept, listening above the speaking skill. Listening is a very good habit, as you will learn many things from people by listening to their experiences and advices (which are not given in the books). Watch English movies/documentaries (without subtitles), and try to understand it. Listen to English songs/news/audio books.Speaking: This one is optional, as it requires a lot of external factors (eg, you need somebody to talk to). But, you can manage it by talking to the mirror\u2014improving your fluency, gestures and self-confidence. Don\u2019t copy the American/British accent, because it will make the situation worse. Be proud of your accent and focus on pronouncing the words\u2014correctly, not the accent which you don\u2019t own.Learn every skill, simultaneously. Learn to praise the beauty of the language\u2014 as an opportunity to get the key to thousands of literary marvels, which are waiting for you\u2014 to read and commend. Lastly, never ever give up!

            "answer_text": "A lot of students find Verbal Ability difficult to crack. And if you ask them what makes Verbal Ability their weak area, a lot of fingers would be pointing towards Reading Comprehension (RC). This article attempts to make Reading Comprehension, a less-complex area for you. While solving Reading Comprehension passages, it is essential to be alert. You shouldavoid simply reading the passage quickly and jumping to the questions.Because then you will be missing out on the \u2018comprehension\u2019 part of RC. In order to master your command over RC, you should know how to prepare for it. Given below are some points that will help you in your preparation. Focus on the following strategies while preparing for RC: 1) Read, Read & Read: Read newspapers, editorials, magazines and novels everyday to get yourself used to different topics.  2) Reading Speed: Pay attention to how you are reading the passages. If you are reading the passage word-by-word or vocalizing each word as you are reading, then you may have a low Words-per-minute rate. Your RCs will then take a lot of time to get over. Try taking in more words at a time while reading. This will help you to finish passages faster. The more you read, the more your eye can accommodate words at a time and thehigher your Words-per-minute rate will be. As a result, you will be able to comprehend sentences and phrases better as your focus will include entire groups of words rather than individual words. 3) Reading vs Skimming: Read through the passages that you are unfamiliar with. Skim through passages that you\u2019re familiar with. This will save a lot of time. 4) Glancing: Glance through the questions first before attempting the passage. This will help you to pinpoint and remember key extracts while reading the passage. This will aid you in solving the questions later ahead. However, do not spend too much time on the questions at the beginning. 5) Moving On: Don\u2019t get stuck on difficult words that appear in the passage. Continue ahead and focus more on the idea being conveyed rather than specific words. 6) Vocabulary: The more familiar you are with different words, the faster you will be able to read the matter. Increasing your vocabulary by learning new words and reading more often will naturally increase your reading speed. 7) Smart Reading: Don\u2019t focus on facts while reading the passage. Try to focus more on the ideas conveyed. This will help in answering questions that are inference/author\u2019s viewpoint based. 8) Central Idea: The central idea is just one idea that is stated directly or indirectly through the different parts of the passages. Most of the illustrations and examples in the passage will try to drive in the same point. So identifying this point is the key to getting the central idea right. 9) Elimination: Try eliminating options in questions involving inferences and central ideas. This will also help to save time. Despite following all the advice and information given above, you will be able to tackle RCs only if you practice solving passages on a regular basis. Implement the above mentioned tips and guidelines to make RCs one of your strong areas. ",

Keeping your motivation high is crucial.Read works that are just on the edge of your ability. If it takes you an hour to read one page, it's probably too hard right now. Read things that allow you to understand the general idea, but that may require you to look up some words (say, up to 15% of them).After you finish reading, pause for a moment and ask yourself what the main points of the piece were. If you can't remember, then you didn't read carefully enough.Read quality writing. If you like news, I recommend The New York Times. If you prefer fiction, anything from the NYRB Classics series (that's New York Review of Books) is excellent. If you feel like reading a \"serious\" novel is out of your reach, don't be afraid to try children's literature. The Wind in the Willows and The Hobbit are excellent for all ages.If you really liked a particular article or story, then re-read it. This step is overlooked all too often, unfortunately.If reading a particular book starts to feel like an unhappy marriage, put it back on the shelf. It's better to move on to something you enjoy rather than force yourself to read something that you aren't interested in.Happy reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, The following is an excerpt from an article which was first published in InsideIIM.com. Hope it helps! a. Picking Picking RC passages is extremely important in the CAT exam and it is something that a CAT aspirant normally ignores. Out of the 5 odd passages present in CAT, it is essential that you choose the best one to start off things with. The first passage should be chosen based on several parameters: Length of the passage: Choose the passage that is shortest in length. Subject Matter: Choose the passage that has a topic that will be a comfortable read for you. For instance, I prefer passages based on science/nature and prefer to skip passages based on philosophy. Question Types: Choose the passages that has descriptive questions at the end of the passage and skip the ones that have inferential questions. These are 3 parameters that you should keep in mind when selecting passages. b. Reading The most important thing, as logical as it sounds, in RC is comprehension. If you can\u2019t comprehend the passage, then there is no way you can get answer the questions. Hence, when reading it becomes important that you understand what the passage is talking about. A lot of candidates get dragged into the trap of speed reading and end up reading the passage so fast that they have no clue what they have read by the end. What I would suggest is reading the passage at a normal pace with focus on comprehension. Read the first paragraph slowly as it lays the ground for what the author wants to say. You can speed up while reading the rest of the passage. Also, one technique that works for comprehension is to paint a visual picture of what the author is saying. The more one imagines, the more likely it is for the passage to stick in memory. c. Eliminating Learn the art of eliminating options. Options with extreme opinions are generally incorrect. When stuck between 2 options, always choose the milder of 2 options. Also, ensure that you read all the words in the options. A tempting option will be one in which the entire sentence will be correct barring the last word which changes the meaning of the sentence completely. This is a generic trick used by paper setters to tempt candidates into picking the wrong answer option. 2. Parajumbles/ Odd sentence out Paragraph Jumbles (PJ) questions and their derivative \u2013 odd sentence out questions are the 2nd most common question type in CAT. Here are a few useful methods to help you decode these question types: (i) Pronouns/shortened name/surname/nickname: If there is a pronoun in a sentence he/she/it/they etc. there should be a preceding statement that introduces the subject in most of the cases. Paper setters try to negate this strategy a fair bit when they make sure that there are two subjects in a particular parajumble with one being named after the pronoun for the other is exhausted thereby confusing aspirants. The way to work around this trap is by making sure that you identify the subject and the action it is performing. In most of the cases, there will be a difference between the \u2018deeds\u2019 of the two subjects which will make you choose the right link by simply maintaining continuity of thought. (ii) Tenses: Ideally, all the sentences will be in the same tense. If there is a reference to a past incident, you have to make sure that all the statements involving the past incident are adjacent to each other. If there is a present and a futuristic scenario being told, you need to make sure that all the arguments of the present point towards the future and so on. This is not a difficult thing to do and once you have sufficient knowledge of tenses, you should be good to go. (iii) Transition Words: Words such as \u2018but\u2019, \u2018therefore\u2019, \u2018hence\u2019, etc. are transition words. Sentences starting with these words generally give an idea as to which sentence comes before this sentence. For example, for sentences starting with \u2018hence\u2019 and \u2018therefore\u2019 among others, the sentence coming before this current one will convey the same idea as the current one. On the other hand, sentences starting with \u2018but\u2019 and \u2018however\u2019 among others, will convey an opposite idea to the sentence coming before the current one. Hence, noticing transition words can be pretty useful in solving these question types. 3. Grammar In case of grammar, it is like understanding a game. If you know the rules well, you can strategize how to play. Most of the time, the errors are with regards to a difference in the \u2018number\u2019 of subjects and the singularity or the plurality of the verb associated with the subject (commonly known and understood as the subject-verb agreement). Another important error is seen in terms of parallel construction of sentences wherein, it is stated that multiple activities that are performed by a subject should be in sync in terms of tense, and symmetry. The third, most common and commonly erred aspect is with regards to idiomatic usage. The best way to approach this section in the limited time available is to solve as many questions as possible and learn whatever rules were not known before. 4. Paragraph Completion A majority of the rules for solving parajumbles are applicable in paragraph completion questions. The things to keep in mind here are logical consistency, continuity with the preceding part of the para, non-introduction of a fresh topic, keeping the trend of generic to specific or vice versa depending on the preceding sentences, continuity in terms of tenses and so on. You can do justice to the question type if and only if you can understand the beauty of construction of a paragraph. So, be on the lookout for paragraphs and how they are ended and how a new paragraph is started. If you can manage to do that with a few techniques, your accuracy should be very high. 5. Critical Reasoning Critical reasoning again requires you to think logically and separate the trivial issues from the main issues. The question would be in the form of a statement or a paragraph and you would be asked to either strengthen or weaken the argument using an appropriate option. The common mistake here is a failure to understand the central argument and assuming statements that aren\u2019t there. Also an important thing to keep in mind is that, repetition of a sentence in the central argument is not the correct enhancer of the argument and so, can be crossed out on grounds of redundancy. The best way to go forward in this section is to practice a few questions and get the hang of it. It\u2019s better not to devote too much time to this section as it has been rare in CAT. 6. Vocabulary Vocabulary is not that extensive when it comes to CAT and is limited to idioms and fill-in-the-blanks questions. There is no requirement to mug up word lists and the quite overrated (in my opinion) Word Power Made Easy (it adds little value and the prefixes and suffixes can be understood through focused casual reading as well). The best thing to do is to identify contextual usage and the mood of the statement (extremes are generally frowned upon, a nice balanced, politically sound word is the way to go) and then look at both the blanks simultaneously. Another strategy is to look at the options and check if 2 of these have the same meaning. If they do, then both the options can be eliminated as both can be the answer at the same time.

            "answer_text": "To improve your reading skills you need to: have clear reading goals;choose the right texts;use the right reading style;use note taking techniques.Reading goals Clear reading goals can significantly increase your reading efficiency. Not everything in print will be of use to you. Use reading goals to select and prioritise information according to the task in hand. Reading goals can be: an essay or seminar subject;a report brief;a selected subject area;a series of questions about a specific topic.Use your reading goals to help you identify the information that is relevant to your current task. Choosing a text You will need to assess the text to see if it contains information that is relevant to your reading goals. Check the date of publication. Is the information up-to-date? Read the publisher's blurb at the back or inside sleeve for an overview of the content.Check the contents page for relevant chapters.Look up references for your topic in the index.If the text does not seem relevant, discard it.Once you have selected a text you can use the following techniques of scanning and skimming to help you identify areas for detailed reading. Scanning Scanning is the technique you might use when reading a telephone directory. You pass your vision speedily over a section of text in order to find particular words or phrases that are relevant to your current task. You can scan: the introduction or preface of a text;the first or last paragraphs of chapters;the concluding or summarising chapter of a text;the book index.Skimming Skimming is the process of speedy reading for general meaning. Let your eyes skip over sentences or phrases which contain detail. Concentrate on identifying the central or main points. Use this technique to: pre-view a selection of text prior to detailed reading;refresh your understanding of a selection of text following detailed reading. Detailed reading and note taking Once you have selected useful information, you can begin to read in detail. Note taking techniques provide a useful aid to reading. Use: underlining and highlighting to pick out what seem to you the most central or important words and phrases. Do this in your own copy of texts or on photocopies - never on borrowed texts; keywords to record the main headings as you read. Use one or two keywords for each main point. Keywords can be used when you don't want to mark the text; questions to encourage you to take an active approach to your reading. Record your questions as you read. They can also be used as prompts for follow up work; summaries to check you have understood what you have read. Pause after a section of text and put what you have read in your own words. Skim over the text to check the accuracy of your summary, filling in any significant gaps. These techniques encourage an active engagement with the text as well as providing you with a useful record of your reading. Avoid passively reading large amounts of text, it does not make effective use of your time. Always use a note taking technique to increase your levels of concentration and understanding. Increasing your reading speed It is more important to improve your reading skills than your reading speed. Being focused and selective in your reading habits will reduce the time you spend reading. If, in addition to using a range of reading skills you want to increase your reading speed, then the following technique will be of use. The average reading speed is about 240-300 words per minute. For the average reader, the eye fixes on each word individually. It is easy for your eye to recognise 4 or 5 words in a single fixation without a loss of understanding. The key to increasing your reading speed is not to increase the speed at which your eyes move across the page, but to increase the word span for a single fixation. A simple way of developing the habit of taking in more than one word per fixation is to take a page of text and divide it length ways into three with two lines drawn down the page. Using a pen or pencil as a pointer, read each line of text by allowing your eye to fall only in the middle of each of the three sections, as indicated by your pointer. Developing your reading speed Don't worry about how quickly you are reading but instead, concentrate on reading the line in only three fixations. As this becomes more natural, practise without drawing lines. Later, reduce the number of fixations to two per line. Once this increased word span becomes a comfortable habit, an increase in your reading speed will occur. Summary Have a clear focus for your reading. Set your reading goals.Survey the text before you spend the time and effort involved in detailed reading.Scan and skim to select the text for detailed reading.Scan and skim after detailed reading to reinforce your understanding.Use a form of note taking whilst reading in detail, to keep you concentrating, aid understanding and provide you with a record of your reading.Using clear reading goals and a variety of reading skills is more important than increasing your reading speed.To improve your reading speed, don't increase the speed of the eye across the page, but increase the number of words the eye recognises in a single fixation.Source :Improving your reading skills Got your answer ???

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The simple answer is to just keep reading, read anything and everything.  Try not to worry about the exact meaning of every single word as long as you understand the spirit of the text.  By all means look up a word you absolutely do not understand every now and then (it will increase your vocabulary after all), but unless you read a scientific or political text it's unlikely that the meaning of a single word will affect your understanding of the text as a whole very much. This will help you learn words in context rather than as their own entities, and language isn't about single words, it's about messages. I personally improved my English reading-proficiency immensely by reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld series as a kid/young teenager.  The first book I read (Interesting Times, in case anyone is interested) was absolutely horrible and took me at least a month to finish.  But the second one was a lot easier, and after a while I could easily finish them all in a day if I had enough spare time to just sit and read. I'm not boasting when I say that I was very probably best in my English class, and I attribute it almost entirely to the fact that I read real books in English, not just the textbooks given to us by the school.  It made it so that I actually enjoyed my learning, while the others found it a chore. ",

            "answer_text": "READING To improve your reading comprehensions, you must READ \u2013 just like seasoned writers tell aspiring writers that the only way you will learn to write better is to WRITE.Read newspapers (print or online). Newswriting uses the simplest form of English and is a good and easy way for someone to work on his/her reading skills.Find books or magazines that deal with things that are related to what you are interested in. Read those too.You might even find children\u2019s story books (or stories online) a good way to read a well-known story in that language you are studying. (I did that for French, the language I was studying some time ago.)If you can find comics in English, use those too.  WRITINGWriting is a skill that helps impress language structure into us.So, try to do some writing.Keep a journal and write lines in English  (they do not have to be long).Write regularly \u2013 every day or every other day. If you take the time to work on writing grammatically correct sentences, just reading your own written lines weeks or months later would be a fulfilling and motivational exercise.(I did that for French too. I described scenes and people I met when I visited another country.) One more: Listen to a speech by someone (as on TED: Ideas worth spreading) and write what s/he is saying. I know \u2013 that is writing, and involves listening skills, not reading.But you know what? Improving one skill also raises the level of your skills in another aspect. USE SCHOOL TEXTBOOKSTry to check in schools for English textbooks that have reading comprehension exercises \u2013 where you read passages and then answer some questions asked.You can check the answers against the given answer keys after completing the exercises.I am not sure if such exercises are provided online. If I locate any, I will let you know. ",

            "answer_text": "Comprehensive reading requires lots of patience, attention, concentration, focus and vocabulary to undetstand. While reading, be sure that you are not hungry, thirsty or anything else, this means there are no unnecessary interruptions. Use lead pencil to underline the words you fail to understand and consult dictionary later to know the meanings of the same. But, never take the help of dictionary at the time of reading as it affects your study and decreases your comprehension power. Besides, give yourself a try to realize any article with guess power which will enrich your confidence level and fill yourself with positive attitude. Pressurise on each and every word separately, observe their positions, functions in the sentence. Last, but not the least, complete reading passages, never finish them. I believe you understand the difference between completing and finishing. Always try to aviod subvocalization which seems a common problem among readers for decades, here I am providing some of most popular techniques to decrease the effect of the same 1. Use Your Finger to Point Your Eyes While Reading Keep on emphasizing the importance of using your finger out and guide your eyes. It\u2019s a central principle to all speed-reading techniques and it\u2019s something that will help you minimize subvocalization. Using your hand to guide your eyes will also help you grab groups of words while reading, helping you avoid another common reading habit, fixation. 2. Distract Yourself To minimize subvocalization, try distracting yourself from saying words in your head. How should you distract yourself? There are a couple of ways to do it. One way is try to chew gum while you read. If you chew gum while reading it will distract you from saying the words in your head.You can also distract yourself from saying words by occupying that voice in your head with another voice. Try counting from one to three while you are reading the material (example: \u201cone, two three\u201d line-by-line). While you are doing this, try fixating your eyes somewhere at the beginning of the line, somewhere in the middle of the line, and somewhere at the end of the line. While you are looking in those three places you want to be counting \u201cone, two, three.\u201d By doing this you will also be fixating on three groups of words, rather than each and every single word. You can count \u201cone, two, three\u201d out loud (maybe whispering) or in your head. Either way, you\u2019ll distract yourself from saying the actual words you are reading. With some practice, you\u2019ll find it easier to avoid saying all the words in your head as you read. 3. Listen To Music While Reading This will not only help you minimize subvocalization, but listening to music may also help you concentrate better. However, keep in mind that not all types of music are going to help you concentrate. You want to avoid listening to music with lyrics or anything with a strong beat because it is going to throw off your concentration. You may also want to avoid listening to songs that remind you of other things (your high school sweetheart, a fight scene from a movie or anything else that might further distract you).Listen to something that is instrumental. Classical music usually works best. That will help you to improve your concentration and it will also help you to minimize your habit of subvocalization. 4. Force Yourself To Read Faster Than You Normally Would Let\u2019s say you normally read 250 wpm. Try going a little faster (maybe 300 or 350 wpm). If you force yourself to go a little faster than you normally read, you\u2019ll minimize the amount of words you say in your head. In addition to minimizing subvocalization, you\u2019ll also improve your focus because you have to pay attention more when you read a little faster. Again, the more you practice pushing yourself faster, the faster you will get. Hope it will cope up with your problem,.......... ",

            "answer_text": "How I can improve reading skills in English and read fast? I am an foreigner. Can anyone help me, please? 1. Pick up a book and read its name. Ask yourself what kind of book it is. Is it a novel? A self-help book? Or an academic book about mathematics? If you can't define its genre, let the online library help you. In the US, almost every public and university library uses Dewey Decimal Classification to manage books. Here is an example of how to search on Harvard library's website. a. Google 'Harvard Library' and you will get its website. Click in. And you will see a webpage like this:    b. When you find the book you are going to read, click in and you will see a webpage like this:   That's it. That's the subject and genre of the book you are ready to read. Why? After this classification, you will have a clear clue about what you will get from the book.  If you know you are going to read a book about mathematics, perhaps you might need to prepare a pencil and a sheet of paper, in case you want to solve an equation. 2. Have a reading record. Reading records can help you mange the books you've read. Like Sherlock Holmes said, a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. You simply can't exactly remember all the words you've read. Therefore, a notebook is your good companion. Recently, I started to use Evernote and found it pretty convenient.  Here's an note as an example. You don't necessarily follow it.   3. Read the table of contents and the preface written by the author. Many people tend to read the main body of the book immediately. They never read the table of contents. But in fact, a table of contents, especially from an academic book, can offer you a clear structure of the whole book. That's what every good book should have. Some tables of contents are a few words, some are short sentences. All in all, they provide you a clear view of what you are going to get from books. When you just to skim a book, please always read the table of contents first. Here are some examples from different books. a. From a novel/fiction   b. From an academic book   c. From a textbook     You see, even though you don't read these books, you've already knew something about these books. Therefore, when you actually start to skim the book, you can easily find  out the key points. That's how to skim a book quickly but still get its main point.   Since you've emphasized you are a non-native speaker, I believe you want to improve your English level by reading.  Here are some tips for you. 1). Read an English book. Don't translate an English book. Translation is an extremely difficult work. Only really well trained scholars can do that. We are just learners. We read books for acquiring knowledge and joy.  Leave the translation works to professors and scholars. It means that there is no need to look up every unfamiliar word into dictionary. Really, you don't have to do that. Even though you really look up the new word into a dictionary, you still can't get the precise meaning.Sometimes, a word is used as an noun, and sometimes it is used as a verb. You can only learn its meaning with the whole page of the book you are reading. However, it is necessary to mark down some words you find marvelous. You love the way the author wrote. Write the nice words or beautiful sentences you think you can use in your own writing and daily communication. I don't make any notes on books, therefore, a lovely notebook is a necessity.   Book is clean.   Besides, I have an e-reader, on which I can easily make some notes and convert notes to my Evernote account.    A website for converting notes.   On my Evernote    If you have no idea how to choose a book to read, there are some good websites about books. 1. GoodreadsGoodreads 2. Brooklyn Public LibraryBrooklyn Public Library They both have apps for cellphone users.  What's more, on Brooklyn Public Library official website, there is a service called  Ask a Librarian.  You create a free account on its website, answer some questions about your book preference. A few weeks laters, a librarian will send you an email to list all the recommendations he/she has made for you.       This service is totally free and you don't need to live in Brooklyn. What an awesome library! Anyway, grab a book and start to read. The more you read, the faster and the better you read. My study desk. :-)   ",

            "answer_text": "It can be said there there are two forms of English. (a) Spoken, which is a limited vocabulary. (b) Written, which is an unlimited vocabulary. From what you wrote, I understand that you are reading a vocabulary that is more advanced and extensive than your speaking vocabulary. Also, understanding the \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d of what you read is dependent upon two factors which nobody taught you in all probability. (1) English is a language based upon logic. (2) What is written may be based upon an \u201cessence\u201d consisting of scientific, philosophical, legal, or theological (religious) concepts. In fact, from what I have seen of English instruction, they prepare students for a limited ability. The common advice given to all students is generally this. \u201cRead Everything.\u201d Obviously, if what you study is \u201ceverything,\u201d you will have a knowledge of \u201ceverything\u201d. There are two suggestions I can offer you, if you want to understand the \u201cessence\u201d of what you read. These are the DO NOTS. #1 Do not try reading everything #2 Do not read novels. The reason is this. There are faster ways to learn. Study fewer words, and learn more. The problem with novels is that there are too many \u201cadjectives\u201d which describe things. Those are not the essential tools in the language. The parts of speech which show you the \u201cessence\u201d are Mental Verbs and basically the verbs which are synonyms for the verb SHOW. (Most of them are found in nonfiction, so if you are serious about learning, start reading nonfiction.) I am going to show you a basic lesson in Mental Verbs.  #1 UNIVERSAL VOCABULARY PART ONE \"Part 1\" This list involves the use of a select number of VERBS which correspond with light phenomena as a kind of Core Vocabulary. These are all synonyms for the word SHOW. I chose SHOW because it is a kind of word with a Universal Utility. In other words, no matter the language, we have a sentence construction like the following: \"Here, I can show you.\" Here is a list: I can SHOW. I can ARTICULATE I can ILLUMINATE I can ENUMERATE I can ENUNCIATE I can POINT OUT I can EXHIBIT I can DESCRIBE I can INSTRUCT I can DEMONSTRATE I can FORMULATE I can CHARACTERIZE I can COMPARE I can CONTRAST I can DIRECT I can ADDRESS I can EXPLAIN I can IDENTIFY. I can PRESENT. I can INTRODUCE. I can INFORM All of these would apply to ideas, thoughts, concepts, feelings, and beliefs and so forth. This list has a sample sentence which \"shows\" with clarity, the use of the word. A clever student can compose simple sentences at first, using this Core Vocabulary. . ============================================================================== SHOW me how we can accomplish this task. I can ARTICULATE the idea this way. Einstein's famous equation ILLUMINATES for us the correspondence between Matter and Energy, Space and Time. I can ENUMERATE three vital Scientific Theories; The Theory of Evolution, the Theory of Natural Selection, and the Theory of the Big Bang. I can ENUNCIATE precisely why you should marry the girl; (a) She's crazy about you. (b) You have perfect harmony together, and (c) I know you love her. I can POINT OUT several objections to buying the car. I can EXHIBIT better behavior than that. I can DESCRIBE why this plan is not going to work. I can INSTRUCT in several subjects of interest to modern people. I can DEMONSTRATE the Scientific Law of Cause and Effect. I can FORMULATE some thoughts about this theory. I can CHARACTERIZE the problem this way, because basically, it is a problem of human selfishness, human heedlessness, and simple indifference. I can COMPARE the opposites to discover the Mean Value, or Middling Value, between either of two Extremes. I can CONTRAST the opposites to clarify the Mean Value, or Middling Value between either of two Extremes. . I can DIRECT your attention to the significant issues involved. I can ARTICULATE the key features of this idea. I can ADDRESS the problem in its several parts. I can EXHIBIT the issue like so. I can EXPLAIN the subject like this. I can INFORM about the Principle of the Burden of Proof. I can IDENTIFY the Three Laws of Logic (as taught by the Greek philosopher Aristotle) in the following manner: (1) The Law of Identity (2) The Law of Non-Contradiction (3) The Law of the Excluded Middle Allow me to PRESENT the several facets of the subject, as follows. First, it is necessary to find the Identity. Second, it is necessary to find the Opposite of the Identity. Third, it is necessary to find the Middling Value, or Mean Value, between the two extremes. The problem may be INTRODUCED for our consideration as follows. (1) What is the claim for the Identity? (2) What are the Extremes, or Opposites? (3) What is the Mean Value or Middling Value? This is how we identify the basic facts about the subject of our research. . .M The second part of your development  of vocabulary will  consist of  making lists for Verb/Noun  \u201cNominalizations\u201d.  Like this one, for the letter \u201cC\u201d. calculate / calculation I can calculate that two plus two equals four. It does not require a lot of calculation to figure out that two plus two equals four. ------------------------------------------ care / caring I care about other people. When I see that other people are suffering, I show my caring by talking to them. -------------------------------------------------------- certify / certification The school can certify that my records are all correct. The school will give some kind of certification when I complete my studies. -------------------------------------------- challenge / challenge (challenge the Verb, as in, \"to challenge\") I will challenge the other boys and girls to a race. (challenge the noun as in, \"a challenge\") This race will be a challenge for me. -------------------------------------- characterize / characterization I think I should characterize some people as very good. My characterization of the very best people will be positive. -------------------------------------------- cite / citation I can cite some examples and I can cite some evidences. When I quote something written in a book, that is called a \"citation\". Here is an example of a citation. I am citing something said by Martin Luther King. ####################### \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\"----paragraph 20, from the \"I Have A Dream\" speech by Christian Minister, Martin Luther King Jr., delivered on 28 August 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D. C. USA. ############################# . . ----------------------------------------------------- clarify / clarification I want to clarify my thoughts before I write them and send them to other people. When I write about a difficult subject, I must try to write with a full clarification about my purpose and intention. ------------------------------------------------------ codify / codification We codify our laws by putting them in writing. Written laws are called \"statutes\" and the publication of them is the \"codification\" of the laws. ------------------------------------------------ collect / collection I will collect the money that my friend borrowed. I like to look at the paintings in my friend's collection of art. --------------------------------------------- communicate / communication I want to develop the power of communication in writing and public speaking. A communication has just arrived and I want to read it to everyone now. ------------------------------------------------ compare / comparison I want to carefully compare the two ideas to see which is better. I have read all the information on this subject and can now give you my comparison. ------------------------------------------------- construct / construction I would like to construct something very useful for other people before I die. These English lessons are my own construction, and they are created as a gift to my students. ----------------------------------------------- correspond / correspondence I would like to correspond with you by e-mail, if that is okay. This correspondence should be personal and private. It is not intended to be considered as public correspondence for the general public to read. -------------------------------------------------- Create / Creation I can create a work of art. This work of art is my creation. M ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I'm from India and I consider myself eligible to write this answer considering the fact that I hail from a non-English country with a wide variety of accents of English being spoken far and wide across the country.  Firstly, my biggest inspiration to pickup speaking a standard English (standard here refers to a non-accentuated, grammatically concise communication) was books. Yes, I belong to that generation which values hard copies of books much higher than the electronic books, and hence I started reading a lot of books primarily of Indian authors early into my life, notably the works of R K Narayan. Reading books helps you imbibe into yourself a better language, grammar, a few idioms at the back of your hand, basic level of confidence to speak to people and much more. I still read books, refer to the Oxford dictionary on a regular basis. Off late internet has been a good helping hand in keeping pace with idioms, phrases and other elements of language. A whole lot of sites are available for improving upon your communications expertise and leaning the right ways of communication. YouTube being the primary source though. I'll try to post the links to a few great sites that help you improve your communication in terms of accentuation, grammar, stress-pause intonation etc shortly. That apart, English newspaper (particularly The Hindu) which is available here in India has been amongst my favourites when it comes to writing content without much fuss, without too much of beating around the bush and providing clear, concise statements that run sharp into the minds of the readers. The newspaper has helped me in terms of framing my statements such that the intended recipient understands what I intend to convey. So a big thanks to the newspaper. Apart from all these, my workplace has been a great help to me too, as I converse with a variety of nationals and the Lingua Franca as we call it has always been English. So this certainly has helped me hone my skills of communication to acceptable level at the international arena. So, it all boils down to the following: 1. Language can't be picked up from any single source, you should be receptive to multiple good sources that help you imbibe the skill into yourself.2. Books are the best and most non-confronting elements that would help you gone your English.3. Internet and English newspapers or dailies would help too.4. Interaction with individuals will help you pick up a few phrases/idioms from them and thereby refine your skills of English as a language. Having said all this, I'd like to conclude stating English is a classic language, please don't fall prey to the SMS lingo, or shortened version of the language. Please adhere to the English as it was one generation ago, for those standards have been much higher and better. Hope this helps Cheers,Sreehari ",

            "answer_text": "Much like with improving your writing skills[1], your reading will also improve with more reading. So keep practicing. English is not my first language, so here\u2019s what I found especially helpful: Decide that you really want to improve your English reading skills and why. This determination will give you the necessary motivation.Pick a topic you\u2019re especially passionate about as that will make reading more fun. For example, I love history, so I would read all these books about British history\u2014in English. (I still do!) I didn\u2019t always understand everything, but it didn\u2019t matter; I understood most of it, and in time, all of it. If I had attempted to read a subject that wasn\u2019t interesting to me, it\u2019s not likely I would have gotten far.One last thing: learning any language, native or foreign, immersing yourself in it is key. This includes movies, music, being in that environment, and a lot of reading and writing. Memorizing words, in my opinion, does not make you learn the language; like a poem, you can recite it back, but it is only when you\u2019re fully and deeply into the trenches, so to speak\u2014when you\u2019re wrestling with the language\u2014that you both learn it and also see just how much of it you actually know (i.e. words you never directly learned will simply appear in your vocabulary through practice). Hope this helps! Footnotes[1] Adi Redzic's answer to How can I improve my English writing skills?",

            "answer_text": "Many people have trouble with reading while learning English. Reading is hard for some people and it can take time. Reading is a process of the brain where you look at symbols on a page, and your mind sees the patterns of characters and understand the meaning in them. Improving reading comprehension skills requires motivation, mental frameworks for holding ideas, concentration and good study techniques.  The most effective way in improving your reading comprehension skills in English is read in English everyday - read outside of your interests in particular. Make a habit of reading regularly. Read as many English books, newspapers and magazines as you can get your hands on. Pick books depending on your reading level, no matter what your age. You can choose interesting and easily read books such as comic books, as well as reading books containing formal words. Reading is about enjoining the experience too. Don't rush, take your time. Most people think that skimming the page(skimming means to just scan the whole page and hardly take in a couple of words)is a way of fast reading, but this is definitely not true.Go through the details to comprehend the text as you read it. Have an idea what you're reading about, not just reading and forgetting or failing to grasp the contents. Listen to audio books and follow the text at the same time. This can aid good pronunciation and word recognition. ",

What you read - when working to build reading skills - should be written in familiar vocabulary. If you choose a book and often come on unfamiliar words - it's not the right book - yet. When you find a book(s) or articles that you feel you can read fairly well - then read. 1/2 hour to 45 minutes every day if you can. Reading like almost everything else requires practice and with practice your reading skills will improve. You will gain speed and 'fluency' - don't strive to read fast though - that's not the point - but read, every day if you possibly can for 1/2 hr. - 45 minutes and with that practice you will improve your reading skills. There's no short cut - it's like someone asking how to get more physically fit. There's no shortcut - fitness comes from daily walking or running. Improved reading comes from daily reading - but the difference is - you will not lose your reading skills. If we stop walking or running, we gradually lose the fitness. The good news is - you don't lose your improved reading skills if you can't at some point keep up the daily reading. ",

            "answer_text": "I love reading. And I love English language. And I\u2019m not a native speaker. Started reading English books more than a decade ago and I still do. As such person, I can tell for sure: \u201cread more books\u201d advice is not useful at all. Surely you need to read more books, but the question is \u201chow\u201d? Here are my thoughts: The key is to pick a book that fits the level of your English skills. If it is too hard, it will be no use; this could only demotivate you. Yet, you need to challenge yourself: if you pick a very easy read, it will be no use either.Read each chapter multiple times. You could also listen to the audio book in the background over and over again. This way you get familiar with unknown words and the structure of sentences. At some point, I picked a chapter per week and listened/read it all the time during the week.Write down unfamiliar words and phrases and study them later, e.g. with flash cards or by making up sentences with these words..I\u2019ve been following this pattern for 10+ years and have read plenty of books which I never thought I could\u2019ve read. Being a software engineer, I created \u201cYou Can Read It!\u201d - Learn English by reading books in English , specifically for people who want to read books in English. It contains: classical English books split onto \u201cdifficulty\u201d levels, so everyone would find their matchbooks are synchronized with audiobooks. You can read or listen (e.g. when doing chores)instant translation of unfamiliar words and phrasesflashcards aboard! Save unknown words and phrases as flashcards and study them!If you\u2019d like to give it a try, feel free to ping me in case of any questions or a feedback. And good luck with your studies! ",

            "answer_text": "Here are few techniques which have transformed my reading skills. Warm Up: You must have seen athletes stretching their muscles before the match kickoffs. Warming up, I am referring here is exactly like similar. What I usually do is, I begin to warm up myself before few days of reading texts or theories that I have to comprehend. For example, If I have to learn and present on the topic Fourier Series, instead of jumping into the theory directly, I begin to build up my understanding on the concepts earlier. This may involve watching some YouTube videos, reading blogs or papers, etc. This warms up as well as builds a bigger picture regarding the theory. I usually do not take any kinds of notes here.Prepare Questions: My warm-up session goes for two to three days. Sometimes, it goes for weeks and even for months. After that, I try to build questions or hypothesis whatever comes into my mind based on the information I have collected. For example, what is Fourier Series? What are its application? Why is it called Fourier Series? How to visualize the techniques? And so on.Figure Out the Big Picture: The big picture gives you the direction or steps to follow while you read the text. The big picture is to understand the reason behind reading or comprehending the text you are going to read. For instance, Fourier Series expands periodic signals as the sum of simple Sine and Cosine waves. The expansion helps us find solutions for extremely complex functions in the field of engineering or in our daily life. This kind of big picture guides and motivates you to read and understand the text.One Paragraph at a Time: When I have to read papers which are extremely important for my research, I read one paragraph at a time. And, while reading I circle the terms, terminologies, theories, methods, etc. that is in the text. If I don\u2019t understand any one of those, I look for resources to understand those first and come back to the text later. After reading each paragraph, I summarize or paraphrase what I have understood from that particular paragraph. This builds a map or structure of the text. So, read and summarize a paragraph at a time.Read, Re-Read, and Repeat: When you read for the first time, you might not get the gist or the big picture behind the text. So, read as many times as you can, in order to understand the text fully. It takes time and toil, but you have to do all this if you have to understand the text nicely.Summarize: This involves connecting all those concepts and information you have gathered from each paragraph. Also, If you have answered all those questions you had in mind while building your hypothesis or questions in step two, you have understood the text properly. Reading and Writing go simultaneously\u2014at least for me.Time to teach some fellas now.Rock and Roll! ",

Reading for meaning, slowly at first, often means reading ONE PASSAGE (a paragraph or 2-3 sentences or 1 complex sentence with several clauses) once (to get the gist); again (to get all the words, their primary and secondary and other meanings); again (to sort the meanings out) and then to read it ALOUD to a KNOWLEDGEABLE native speaker, so it makes sense to the listener; and then EXPLAIN the MEANING, using different words than those found in the passage you read. Sound difficult? It isn't, it can be FUN, learning the new words, doing the Dictionary Dance, and smoothing out the lumps in ;your intake. That's a) above. Now b) is when you carry flash-cards in your pocket; of the new words, terms, meanings you gleaned from Process a), above. You review the flash cards several times a day and quiz yourself on them. You set cards aside AS-WHEN you have memorized them. Keep them in your Vocabulary Shoebox. Then USE the words, terms and meanings in live conversation with your friends, associates. Your friends or associates can't understand you? can't understand the new terms? FIND NEW FRIENDS who can!

What worked for me was starting reading  Zelazny's Amber books in one language and then switching to English, because I could not wait for the next installation to be translated. :-) I'd add - write down your favorite quotes - especially beautiful sentence, sentence the resonates with you, a sentence by which you'd like to remember the book. But I do it for all three languages in which I read. :-)Say Keng Lee's advise is how to get as much as possible as quickly as possible out of something that you have to read - for a study or for a test. I'd add: read the questions before starting the reading the essay,read the first sentence of the paragraph and then read the last - if they are connected logically, you can go to the next paragraph, keep your eyes open for the key words: first, second, a. b. c. or numbered sentences, most, least, main. Don't mark the book - copy. Hands have a memory of their own. You can use this system for reading in your first tongue too - it's amazing for the study, but reading for the soul - you are not going to learn this way.So before picking one of the answers to follow, you have to decide *why* you want to learn reading. Best luck! ",

When I was learning Spanish I bought a few novels and tried to read them, I think I read more of the dictionary than the book. Every few words I ran into something I wasn't familiar with. I took that as I sign that I was too far away from what I knew. It made reading the book impossible and more like studying vocab. I opted for texts that correlated well with the words I already knew. So I'd read articles about current events, topics I was interested in, and some short stories. These were a lot easier to digest and I could actually enjoy reading them. After some time doing that, your vocab will increase and eventually you'll be able to read just about anything with fairly little difficulty. ",

First thing I would suggest to change - find articles and books you really want to read. Don't spend time on reading something other people recommend, but you personally don't enjoy. This kind of reading only makes you feel tired and demotivates you. Try to change your approach to \"learning\" English. It does not work this way.  English is a living language people use for communication. It is not a word list you need to memorize. It's not a grammar table. It is a language you need to enjoy using every day. Learn something new and useful every day. Make friends (with people, not with book characters). So, I would highly recommend you to stop \"learning\" English by reading books. It does not bring you any closer to fluency. Communication does. Learning from real-life conversations does. Reading should take 10% or less of your practice time.  Once you start using English for something more real than just a \"reading exercise\", you will see yourself improving. ",

It was because I've learned so many new words and suddenly time tenses started to make sense!! The great thing is that the language matures with its reader. First the protagonist and targeted readers (all though the book is of course loved by adults as well) are 11 and age up with Harry to 18, so does the language. Just great for a steady improvement. It\u2019s important to learn that you don't have to understand every single word. Just try to get an idea of how the story itself involves. Don't translate every unknown word with a dictionary, try to decipher its meaning from content. Only look up words that you cannot infer and that pop up more than twice. ",

            "answer_text": "Basic Facts on English Pronunciation Each English word has an accented syllable; you must pronounce the stressed, accented syllable's vowel accurately. Otherwise, the accent is on you! The rest shown by schwa, symbol \u0259. Word endings in two groups: voiced group bdg; unvoiced group ptk. Words of voiced group are pronounced long; the unvoiced short. E.g., \"If you bed with bat, I bet you\u2019ll feel bad.\" Practice according to these basics, and you will be understood! Oh, one more thing, if your native tongue has trilled r-sound, cut it out! it prevents your spoken English from being understood. Although English is not a tone language, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with its tonal feature, you can appreciate what a tone component built into a sentence sounds like by this brief illustration: \"This is Wednesday, isn\u2019t it?\" This query can be uttered two ways. (1) if you\u2019re unsure, raise voice at \"it.\" (2) If you\u2019re sure, drop voice at \"it,\" not a query at all but only for emphasis. Note that inflection isn\u2019t written into this query. Inflection via tone changes is written into tone languages, not English. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A (thank you!) The key to reading comprehension is understanding, understanding, understanding!  What this means is you've gotta think a little about what you've read once you've read it.  Usually, in class, teachers do it this way : Give the class a passage, make them read it (no matter how strongly they protest, even if they begin to weep) and then make them answer questions. You could do that : plenty of workbooks out there which have exercises like that. Another method, and this is my favourite, is read what you like. I like novels, so I read novels, and this helped improve my writing, too Crime and detective stories make for good comprehension checkers, because, well, if you get lost somewhere from the beginning to the end, you obviously don't understand something.  Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "English, by its origin and evolution, is a very ancient language, which has been around for many centuries. Over the time, it has derived its influences from various other languages like Latin and French. Even the modern English used today, is changing rapidly, with its growing globalization. So, in order to master this beautiful language, you need to be able to understand its grammar, vocabulary and phonics. As we know, the same words in English might have different meanings or pronunciation. For eg., might(as a verb) - He might come home today.might(as a noun) - He showed his might on the weak.Some words, which have different spellings, have the same pronunciation. For eg., 'Know' and 'No' - Have different spellings and meanings but have the \t same pronunciation.Hence in order to improve your reading comprehension in English, you need to read as many books, novels, magazines as you can and try to understand the usage of different words and phrases. Also, whenever you come across a new word or phrase, try to find out its meaning. ",

In general, converse with your friends, teachers and if possible, family(you'll not be embarrassed even if you make mistakes,right? ) in English.If you don't understand, do ask them what they meant.That's what it is for. Read a book in two weeks.Start out with easier books(I don't know what you consider easy to read, help me so that I can suggest) and move on to more difficult ones.Choose genres you prefer.While reading , do sit with your phone, search any word unknown to you on Google, or in your mobile dictionary app(great free ones out there ! ) Read good English dailies. While typing a message to anyone, type in English, unless they have language-problems. I know this will take patience but, write a page of thought every day.Things like, something great that happened that day, something you're excited about, something you're looking forward to.Get it? If you want to improve within a shorter period, I suggest you join a course.Either those over-the-top English speaking courses, or the other better option which is, join an English tuition!Someone who'll teach not just the rules of grammar and all that, but help you with the language in every way.

            "answer_text": "You might try reading some good novels, and, with each one, study the characters carefully, pretending that they are real people, which is what the writer wants you to do. Then, stop reading occasionally, and ask yourself what you think these people are going to do. When you continue, you will find out if you are correct, or close to correct, or way off. You almost always have a chance of being correct, because novelists typically have their characters behave in ways that are logical, even if odd. This can be a fun game, and, if you enjoy it, it will likely raise your level of comprehension. ",

This will help you in concentrating while you read because then you'll know words and their meanings. Second thing you can do for improving your reading is find and learn hard words and their meanings. For this you can either refer to a dictionary or search for a good English book that will help you in improving your word power. Third thing you can do is read daily. Keep track of what you read and you can also find material of your own interest. It'll increase your knowledge and will also help you in comprehensions. If you want more support regarding books buying and selling, you can refer to MyPustak. This is the best place to search for your books that too free of cost. Hope my opinion helps you\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Despite the focus on reading and writing, these days, the fact is that a person's speaking to writing ratio is roughly 99:1. That means, in any given 24 hour period, an average person will speak 99 times as many words as he/she writes.  Of course there are exceptions. I am a writer. There are days when I just sit at my laptop and write. I don't talk, I don't eat, I don't look at e-mails or watch a movie -- all I do is write. I shower as soon as I wake up so I don't even need to shower the whole day. But that's not how the average person does things, most days. Even I'm not like that on most days.  So, my advice to you is to speak. I know the question is about reading. But you pick up many things when you speak and listen. These help you when you read, making reading more enjoyable and also more effective and useful. ",

Someone at your school should be able to guide you to a professional who could test you for psychological problems. Even if your reading skills are not necessarily where you would want them to be, this might not affect your decision to get a degree in computer science. You may have a deficiency in reading, but in many individuals, such deficiencies are made up for by other skill sets. Your job will be to find out what you excel in, and follow that track. It may not be what you expect, but it\u2019s worth the effort to find out what it is. I can understand why this would be embarrassing for you. But these are the struggles that life presents us with.

            "answer_text": "I would suggest to firstly analyze your problem and find what specifically makes reading comprehension difficult. Is it the vocabulary or the grammar? Do you have trouble remembering what you have read or do you have trouble concentrating on a long article/chapter etc. Once you have assessed your situation you can start working towards finding a solution to your problem. On a more general note, I believe it is important to eliminate all sorts of distractions (if possible) if you want to read effectively These include smartphones, laptops and pretty much all unnecessary electronics. Also, try not to read immediately after you have had something to eat because it generally makes you drowsy and lethargic. It is very difficult to read while feeling sleepy. Lastly, it is a good idea to take breaks when reading long texts. Not only does it help you concentrate better but it also helps you retain information. If none of the above helps keep in mind that forced reading (e.g. having to read for a test or an exam) is much more tedious than reading that you do for pleasure. Hope this helps, good luck with your readings! ",

Listening well and reading intently are the first steps in good oral and written communication. Build your knowledge of grammar (Wren & Martin), syntax, vocabulary and so on. Before you use a particular word, say beautiful, check the online thesaurus for synonyms and use the most appropriate word. Vocabulary is built brick by brick. So learning one new word leads to learning many others. Check the exact meaning of every new word from the dictionary, instead of trying to guess the meaning from its context. Read a lot of good authors. Listen to a lot of good speakers. Yet, in either case, develop your own unique style. Write short speeches, memorize them, internalise them and deliver them before the mirror or a better speaker than you. Practice makes perfect. Join a local Toastmasters Club or other public speaking club. Standing Ovation - Fifteen speeches to steer the budding orator by Sterling Publishers on Amazon will be a great help. ",

One new word a day is still good.  But if you can do ten, that's 3,650 new words a year.  Not bad for a starter.  Rome was not built in one day.

If you want to improve your speed, you'll have to stop mouthing the words. It's a weird habit forced into children by parents and teachers who want to HEAR the kids reading out loud so that they know the children aren't doing anything else. ZIP your mouth shut and read aloud in your mind. Do not move your head from side to side, move your eyes from one line to another. You'll be surprised at how many minutes you'll shave off simply by practicing these 2 things.. and in a competitive exam, every minute counts. Happy fast reading ",

Also with books, you can start with easy stuff like kids\u2019 tales and picture books. Stay consistent and work your way up to more challenging material. Also try sites like these that are fun to play along with and train your brain and pronunciation with audio and visual. The most important thing is that you read A LOT and you are constantly trying to read new things while progressing with traditional literature as well. When all else fails, get a popular story (like Shakespeare etc.) in two languages side by side. ",

            "answer_text": "There aren't any abbreviations or tricks to learn English in a few days. Of course \u2018a few days\u2019 It self is a relative term. Make a beginning and assess the speed of progress. You can devote more time. It is a hard work and will need persistent efforts. If you are willing to take this path please read on. Be proud of your vernacular background. Your emotional quotient resides your vernacular language. Try and build proficiency in vernacular language. This sound weird???~ Profiency of vernacular language forces you to look for appropriate words in the new language you learn. Besides in the initial stages everyone forms a sentence in the vernacular language he is comfortable with and translates it to ENGLISH. Capabilities of Imagination / structuring a narration / relevance of tenses and such other concepts get transposed from the 1st language to the new language you learn. In this case it is English. Learning any language has following components. 1 - Grammar 2 - Vocabulary 3 - Comprehension ability 4 - Narration / Composition Grammar - Syntax + Tenses Vocabulary - Meaning + Usage Comprehension - Ability to understand written / spoken Narration / Composition - Ability to Express thoughts / Opinions + Structure the narration written or spoken Take a hard look and find out which of above needs to be strengthened. Read novels / Short Stories /Essays. I can suggest a few books. Many of the titles mentioned below have been re- written in simple language. Choose the level you are comfortable with Tomswayer - Mark Twain Jungle Book -Rudyard Kipling My India - Jim Corbet Malgudi Days - R. K. Narayan Wings Of Fire - A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Robinson Crusoe Gulliver's Travels Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea -Jules Verne Around The World In 80 Days Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austin Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens Sherlock Holmes Ashenden -Bernard Shaw Oxford's Reading Circle Series Check books by following authors Jonathan Swift Ravindranath Tagore Sudha Murty Arundhati Roy Chetan Bhagat Earnest Hemingway Edgar Allen Poe Keep out academic / science / technology books. They have very small literary footprint and do not help in linguistic sphere. Take a note of the sentences that appeal to you or you find interesting. Similarly note the new words along with their usage. Usage modifies the meaning of the words. Example This book is a shade better than other books. The lawyers arguments exposed shades of hypocrisy. \u201cWait for me in the tree shade, after you come out of the tuition class\u201d, said my mother. The lamp shade fell of due to turbulent wind. Word game - How many words can you find with 'eat' letter combination. Heat / neat / seat / beat / peat / treat / meat / sweat / cheat / death / threat / create/ wheat great / \u2026.?. Try your luck with different letter combination. 'ust' Dust / Just / Trust /Burst / Must / Lust / Crust / Gusts / Custard /Bust \u2026.??? Coin more challenges like only verbs and see how many you can find. Words with similar themes Danger / risk / endanger / perilous / Pernicious / Precarious Try and use the words in meaningful sentences. Choose a simple topic of your interest or a simple story. Write three to four paragraphs. Read them and see if you can improve the narration. Search for more appropriate words. As you practice choose a bit difficult topic and continue. Stand before the mirror and narrate / speak about some topic without referring to written text. If you can get an audience then get it. Watch documentaries with sub titles. Watch TV News Channels /Discussions As far as technical writing is concerned you need to be precise. You must be well versed with scientific terminology. Example - speed / velocity + Heat /Temperature / Calories you most know the scientific definitions. It is a hard work but the results will surprise you. ",

Do you need it for work?Are doing it just for your own pleasure?How much time can you take for this activity? One general advice that applies to all cases is reading magazines and/or newspapers: you'll generally find a good mix of formal and informal expressions, plus you'll get a good grip of the culture and the general common sense of that population.

I think it totally depends on an individual\u2019s pace and ability to learn. So considering the amount or the type of work that needs to be put in for learning the language English, one must be obedient in terms of being sincere to observe new things. As far as understanding is taken into point, I think we all have that ability to understand the language through gesture that are been made while speaking. All the problems in this world comes only when one has to speak. It can be any other language not just English, If you go through my previous answers you will see that I have already told the same thing to practice for the people who intend to learn the language and I think you are no exception when it comes to learning., So request you to kindly go through it so that it would at least be a base for learning. Also make sure to take some advice from others too which would be extremely helpful to you as I say that any suggestion from any corner of the world would have a great impact on an individual.
