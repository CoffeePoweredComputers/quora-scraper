            "answer_text": "Thank you Aarushi for asking me to write. When I came to New Delhi to be a bureaucrat much before, perhaps you were even born, I carried a book with me, given as a parting gift by my revered English Teacher and its cover bore his autograph which said, \u201cTo my beloved student, Devidasan\u201d and that book was entitled, \u201cHow to win friends and influence people\u201d by the same Dale Carnegie you have mentioned in your question! Books never grow old, they are timeless and when they contain timeless wisdom, they become light, illuminating the person who is reading it.  Few days ago, Robin Sharma in his blog recommended \u201cThe Magic of Thinking big,\u201d written by David Schwartz and he goes on to say, \u201cEvery student, teammate and human being should read this book along with \u201cHow To Win Friends and Influence People\u201d by Dale Carnegi!.\u201d That is the power of Dale Carnegie and yet, you know Aarushi, it would be difficult for you to believe, Dale Carnegie committed suicide! This however does not mean that the books penned by him are in any manner inferior, but to drive a point across home that learning life skills means much beyond learning how to be talented. It is learning how to be talented on one side and on the other, how to lead a happy and \u201cbalanced\u201d life in the society we live in. Unfortunately, today\u2019s educational system revolves only around talent acquisition forgetting that holistic aspect which often leads to complication and disasters in life. Well, there are tones of books written by people of eminence on life skills. Let me give below few of them.  These are only indicators and have I tried to give a mix that can go with young and old alike. Knowledge is shallow enough for a babe to come and drink without the fear of drowning and deep enough for scholars to dive into without ever reaching the bottom!  \u201cSeven Habits of Highly Effective people\u201d, Stephen R Covey,\u201cPower of Positive Thinking,\u201d Norman Vincent Pele\u201cYou can win,\u201d Shiv Khera,\u201cPanchatantra,\u201d Vishnu Sharma,\u201cMaximum Achievement\u201d Brian TracyThe Naked CEO, Alex MalleyTough times never last, tough men do.\u201d Robert H Schuler, The Be Happy Attitude, Robert H Schuler\u201cWho moved my cheese,\u201d Spencer Johnson \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d Rober Kiosaki\u201cThe Magic of Thinking Big,\u201d David Schwartz with \u201cHow to Win Friends & Influence People.\u201d\u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d  Napoleon Hill. Aarushi, when I checked, I could not see even your photo on your profile.  You may like to update your Profile with a photo. I think that you are a young person, most likely studying for a university Degree. I would suggest that you should also consider\u201cliking\u201d the following pages on FB: Deepak Chopra, Richard Branson, Jim Ron, Brian Tracy, Anthony Robins, Vivekananda, Zig Ziglar, SRK and Robin Sharma. You may always come back to me if you think I can be of more help. Affectionately, ",

            "answer_text": "How to Win Friends and Influence People free pdf I have given free pdf link for who can't afford for a book check it out if you need. This book is an interesting read and one can learn useful skills on how to make friends.However, I felt I don\u2019t need to make friends with everybody and all kind of people. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time. The advice given in the book is valuable to the salesperson who need to please all type of people. It may also be good for people who have personality issues and finds it difficult to make friends. I would like to make friends by being myself and risking rejection. I would like to influence people in an honest way without any manipulation and pretending. Having said that, the book is an interesting read and not all garbage. The only book that succeeded in leading me away from being lost in the social world. Unlike most How to books, Carnegie is capable of bringing insight on top of telling you what to do. Imagine someone telling you to blindly follow a rule, while another makes you understand the reasoning behind his rule before giving you the choice to do it, which would succeed? Carnegie's insight in his book is mind-opening, and the best part is that his insights made sense to the point that I do not need to forcefully memorise his rules in social interactions because it's something that sticks in your mind wherever you go, whoever you meet.

From the \u201cPower of Habits\u201d, I have learned that most of my daily activities are not based on a profound logical thinking but rather they are the fruit of years of automations. This book is not a panacea on how to get rid of bad habits but a framework with tools to analyse them and from there building new routines. I have learned that companies spend millions of dollars to lure us and what we think defines us and makes us unique is, to some extent, a common feature between all humans. We are similar and we continuously make bad choices. This book is a good start if you want to better understand the human condition. From \u201cNever Eat Alone\u201d, I have learned the importance of moxie, networking and initiative. I learned that the key to success is not a very high IQ but very high interpersonal skills. Everyone has something to teach you so you should endeavour to reach out to the others and to get the best from them. This book highlights also the importance of communication and public speaking and some tips to transmogrify yourself from being a shy introvert to a confident extrovert. ",

Written in a flawless manner, it is perhaps the closest it comes to panacea, in matters of self improvement. This is a book complete in all senses as well as addresses most of the questions a person might have on self-development. A highly recommended book, and after reading this, the rest of the list becomes redundant. The Power of Positive ThinkingA more gentle touch to the idea of improvement, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale guides through the process in a gentle, yet effective manner. More recommended for people of an already calm  temperament, seeking to gain fulfillment in life. The Secret (book)A more metaphysical touch to the process of attaining one's goals, this is a recommended book for believers in the metaphysical concepts of the Law of Attraction. There is a video available directed by the same author, which summarizes the teachings of the book in an equivalent, if not better, way. The Power of Now A spiritual edge to the vast genre of self improvement, this is perhaps Eckhart's best written and the most famous book.

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define networking but I would recommend two books in particular: The trusted advisor (David Maister, Charles H. Green and Robert M. Galford). One could say that effective networking is about becoming one of the top 3 people that your contacts will think about when they seek advice on a topic that is important to them (business issues, wealth management, educating their kids, finding a good restaurant\u2026.). This book is a classic read for management consultants on how to form deep personal and professional bonds.Pitch anything (Oren Klaff). This book is not about networking per se but it is a useful complement to the first book. When you read \u201cthe trusted advisor\u201d it is easy to take away the message that you must be humble always, listen more than you talk, be comfortable in the shadows of others. That is not always true. You also need to be able show extreme confidence and poise when it is required to get things done. People will respect you if you are able to behave like an \u201calpha\u201d when the situation calls for it. This second book is a very interesting deep dive into the psychology of professional interactions, that teaches how to capture the attention and respect of others.Besides these two books, I would say that networking is about being curious, able to engage on a wide range of topics, having lots of stories to tell in both formal and informal circumstances. The non-fiction best seller list is an excellent starting point for that, if you aim to read at least 2 books a month. These suggestions are based on research that we have done at Coucou, on the methods of people who are very good at networking. ",
