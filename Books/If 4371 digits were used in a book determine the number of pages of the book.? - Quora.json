First assume the first page is labeled page 1 and a page constitutes one side of the page. Single-digit pages is 9x1 digits =9 Double-digit is (99\u20139)x2=180 Triple is (999\u201399)x3=2700 Now it is obvious that the book has pages in the thousands. Page 999 has 2819 digits. Every page thereafter equals 4 digits. 4371\u20132819=1552 digits more than page 999 1552/4=388 pages more than page 999 999+388=1387 pages. ",

            "answer_text": "S. Amir Hossein Shobeyri,, Mathivanan Palraj, Steven Fussell and Voicu Dascau, are all basically correct as answering the question as asked. However, partly because of the number being 2 pages out, and partly because 4371 is a triangular number, I suspect that the question is wrongly worded. It should be something like: If the sum of the page numbers used in a a book it 4371, determine the number of pages in the book.Then the answer is 93, because 93 (93 +1)/2 = 4371. ",
