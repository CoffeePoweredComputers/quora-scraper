            "answer_text": "First up: You can't *make* your girlfriend do anything. Perhaps you mean \"encourage\"? Second: It depends very much on what you mean by \"talk more\". Are you talking about being chatty, or discussing relationship issues, or talking more during sex? There are different answers to each... If it's just being chatty, and if she is by nature not very talkative, why are you trying to change her? If she is comfortable not chatting much then that is who she is - can you accept her the way she is? If it's about communicating effectively in your relationship then that is a larger issue - good relationships rely on good communication skills - effectively expressing ones own needs and checking on the needs of the other. Maybe she has had bad experiences in the past, maybe she is a natural introvert, maybe she hasn't had much relationship experience. I have too many questions about this to be able to really provide much of an answer beyond this. ",

Know what she likes and what she doesn't.if she is an introvert then the only way you can make here talk to you more is by getting her out of house and go with her for a date or trips of casual walks .give her space to open up to you.she shall feel secure being with you and talking to you.build up that trust factor in your relationship. Lastly please understand your girlfriend also is a human being and have her own personality. Don't be too dependent on her for your emotional needs and talk's Give her space and let her reciprocate too ",
