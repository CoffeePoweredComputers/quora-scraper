            "answer_text": "Depends on the type of book. A children\u2019s picture book on average is 32 pages with illustrations on just about every page (while including double spread page art) while a children\u2019s novel could have a less picture and more words (i.e Redwall). I wrote a children\u2019s book that I\u2019m currently illustrating now. I have 28 pages of story but a total of 30 illustrations was included. ",
