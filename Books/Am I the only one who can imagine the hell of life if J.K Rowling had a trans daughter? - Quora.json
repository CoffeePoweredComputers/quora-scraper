But maybe if she had a \u2018trans\u2019 daughter or \u2018tran\u2019s son then she might understand more if she doesn\u2019t now. I did read what she said and I wonder if she just put her foot in it and didn\u2019t bring her brain into gear before she commented. It does happen. I\u2019m a \u2018trans\u2019 woman (had surgery many decades ago now so don\u2019t even remember what it was like to be a \u2018boy\u2019 in my teenage years. I\u2019ve been a mental health counsellor and worked with women\u2019s groups and I never had any trouble relating to women as my brain is female. I\u2019ve worked with \u2018trans\u2019 women and men and they are people like I\u2019m a person. I would not want to invade anyone\u2019s space be it men or women\u2019s exclusive spaces if I was not wanted. I don\u2019t find it a big deal as I just get on with my own life. I\u2019m married to a lovely cis gender heterosexual man who sees me only as a woman not a \u2018trans\u2019 woman. We\u2019ve been together for over 32 years now - I\u2019m 72 by the way so now a \u2018geriatric\u2019 \u2018trans\u2019 woman. I can understand women being worried that men who still have penises going into women\u2019s spaces if they feel vulnerable rape and violence. I\u2019ve been raped and beaten in my life by a men and they didn\u2019t know I was a \u2018trans\u2019 woman either. This was before I met my husband. But I know what it\u2019s like to be fearful of men after what happened to me but thankfully I got over it in time. I don\u2019t know Ms Rowling's personally of course but seen a couple of the films of her books and enjoyed them for fun. ",

Maybe having her as a mother would be great. Perhaps she would be really helpful with financial needs. Perhaps being her child would offer some level of protection against discrimination as well. Perhaps she would have been an advocate for the trans community. Perhaps she would have created a foundation that provided support to trans people. It might not be hell at all. It could have been great for both her and the trans community in general. ",

If a family member came out as trans, it would give her the chance to learn. ",
