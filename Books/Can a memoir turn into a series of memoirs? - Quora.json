            "answer_text": "Let me tell you, there seems to be an assumption in this question. The assumption is that a memoir is, by definition, some sort of autobiographical inventory of a person's life. In other words, when somebody sits down to write a memoir, they're basically telling their complete life's story. That's not true. Let's just get that out of the way. A memoir is really just your own personal analysis and re-telling of certain episodes in your life. This doesn't mean that you're obligated to tell about all the episodes that happened in your life. Now that we have that out of the way, then the answer to the question of \u201cCan a memoir turn into a series of memoirs?\u201d is a resounding yes. You can start off with a memoir about a certain event in your childhood that affected you to this very day. You can tie whatever achievements you may have had to that specific turning point in your childhood. In your next book, you can talk about your experiences with members of the opposite sex or finding a job or starting a business. I hope you see the picture. A memoir book is really episodic. It just tackles certain topics and then you can layer on or follow up on that book by looking at other incidents in your life. You can then follow that up with another book about other sets of facts. Do you see how this works? That's why a memoir is an awesome way to make money passively. You tell your story and if enough people buy your book, you can leverage whatever brand you've established by writing another memoir book exploring another incident in your life. Now, you may be thinking to yourself \u201cIsn't this tiresome? Doesn't this take too much work?\u201d Well, that's where ghost writers like Gene Eugenio, Lynda Michaels, Clay Williams and others come in. That's how they make their bread and butter. They just send you a questionnaire, you fill it out and before you know it, you have yourself a memoir book in your series and you can then crank out another book in the series and then another book after that. It really all boils down to how well your books sell. The best part to all of this is that after you publish a book, that book can continue to sell year after year without you having to lift a finger. How awesome is that? That's passive income. ",

            "answer_text": "An author absolutely CAN publish a collection of true autobiographical stories. It so happens I've just finished editing such a collection for a retired rocket scientist. That's going to be a worthwhile book (titled To the Moon on a Slide Rule). However, it stretches the envelope to call such a collection a \"memoir.\" Typically, a memoir has one narrative arc that shows how and why events unfolded with regard to one particular challenge or segment of the author's life. There may be other sequences of events the author wants to tell as well. I would ask whether those could somehow be integrated in, perhaps as a relevant flashback. My own memoir focuses on a period of about a decade, but it goes back to include material that happened earlier. One narrative arc is my preference. In my view it's an indication that the author spent time finding an overall pattern and meaning. Without doing that, there's a risk of adding \"everything but the kitchen sink\" (saying, well why not also include this other thing that was also interesting?). On the other hand, it's your book, and rules are broken all the time. A collection was what my rocket scientist author wanted. He seems happy with what he's getting. Far be it from me to say that's against the rules. But unless the separate stories are closely related, revolving around one aspect of the author's life, I probably wouldn't call it a memoir. ",

            "answer_text": "Taking the question to mean \u201cCan one write a series of memoirs?\u201d, the answer is yes. Though it\u2019s rare for a writer to publish more than one memoir, there\u2019s no limitation on the number other than one\u2019s ability to shape each one with a story arc of interest to the reader. Here are some examples: MARY KARR The Liar\u2019s Club explores her deeply troubled childhood in a gritty industrial section of Southeast Texas in the 1960s. Cherry was about Karr\u2019s late adolescence and early womanhood. Lit: A Memoir details what she called her \u201cjourney from blackbelt sinner and lifelong agnostic to unlikely Catholic.\" TOBIAS WOLFF This Boy\u2019s Life was about Wolff\u2019s youth, and In Pharaoh's Army about his later service in Vietnam.
