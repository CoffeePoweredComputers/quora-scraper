            "answer_text": "Well then. I\u2019m going to give an approach that I think is worth it: a side-by-side education in physics and mathematics. Why? It seems redundant; doesn\u2019t physics teach you all you need to appreciate it and know it well? No. You can\u2019t appreciate conservation of energy or momentum until you can appreciate Noether\u2019s theorem, and thus also group theory (the study of symmetry). You can\u2019t appreciate the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients given to you in quantum mechanics without group theory, either. Add on some representation theory for good measure. You can\u2019t appreciate Maxwell\u2019s equations or General Relativity without tensors. You can\u2019t appreciate the Schrodinger equation without some probability theory, and so on. Here we go!  Preliminaries Calculus. Any standard text should do. If you can\u2019t identify one, go with a combination of (any Calculus book on Amazon with an average rating of 4.5+ stars and lots of ratings) and Khan Academy. Do problems. Physics. A generally cited text is the Halliday and Resnick book(s) for introductory physics. I personally ended up learning my intro physics from (again) Khan Academy. Do problems. Linear Algebra. The beauty of Linear Algebra is that you can learn it any time after learning what a variable is. I\u2019d recommend a book like Linear Algebra Done Wrong, but I initially learned it from Linear Algebra by Fraleigh and Beauregard, and that was a wonderful book too. I also think Khan Academy\u2019s best series, by far is their Linear Algebra series. Do problems. When possible, you should also write programs to do these things for you. This will come in handy later. Necessary Stuff Vector Calculus and Differential Equations. These are two subjects you\u2019re going to need to know well for physics. Any standard text will do (see Calculus tip above). Do problems. Note: I\u2019ll stop saying to do problems now, because you should realize that the only way you actually learn is by doing problems until you can pull out this stuff at any time, days later. Modern Physics. The text I used was pretty terrible. Got no recommendations for this, but there are standard texts. Useful Stuff Fourier Series. There\u2019s a book called Applied Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by Haberman that I cherish. I think it\u2019s great. Probability and Statistics. In particular, Mathematical Statistics by Wackerly is pretty great in my opinion; the first half covers Probability Theory sufficiently. I got a whole new appreciation for quantum mechanics by reading this, and I think you should learn it first or at least alongside QM. Numerical Ordinary Differential Equations. This taught me a lot of great things. I was taught from \u201cA First Course in Numerical Differential Equations\u201d by Iserles. If you need more programming background to do the exercises, I suggest getting prepped on that. Necessary Stuff Part Two Classical Mechanics. There\u2019s probably a classic text, but you should have the mathematical maturity by now to handle Classical Mechanics by Goldstein. If not, see the next book. Mathematical Methods in Physics. In particular, the two texts that come to mind are Boas and Arfken. Boas is lighter, Arfken is heavier. I like Arfken except for his chapter on tensors. Quantum Mechanics. The standard is by Griffiths, and I liked that one. However, he sometimes misses out on mathematical magic that makes some of his examples a lot easier. I think Shankar\u2019s text is great. If you aren\u2019t following, see the above books :) Electrodynamics. You probably should use Griffiths, or I hear Zangwill\u2019s text is good. I didn\u2019t like Griffiths, but Jackson might still be a little above you unless you\u2019ve really learned a lot from Arfken. Useful Stuff Part Two Real and Complex Analysis. I never properly learned Real & Complex Analysis, but I\u2019m finding myself lacking in those areas, and that\u2019s affecting my ability to do research and projects (like in a recent project). Numerical Linear Algebra. There\u2019s a lot of wonderful things about matrix analysis that I never learned in my Linear Algebra class that is also immensely useful for understanding Quantum and Classical Mechanics. Trefethen is the standard. Solid State Physics. This will solidify plenty of the quantum mechanics stuff, and you learn great things about materials you see every day. The texts by Kittel or Ashcroft/Mermin are both fine, but Kittel seems to have some important mistakes in some fundamental equations and derivations. Subatomic/Nuclear/Particle Physics. This will solidify classical/electrodynamics, and will solidify your understanding of special relativity. It\u2019s where I first felt I was learning real physics. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t remember what text we used, the lecturer I had was amazing all by himself. Necessary Stuff Part Three Statistical Physics. I used Kittel\u2019s text, but I didn\u2019t like it that much. Get a standard text that\u2019s big and thick. Plenty of places have you learn this before quantum mechanics, but I\u2019ll be honest and say that I didn\u2019t appreciate what I was learning until after. I hear the text by Pathria is good. Computational Physics. The book by Landau is good; he made a version for Python. This will really solidify your understanding of physics. Useful Stuff Part Three Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics. The text by Tinkham, while old, is amazing. This is where I really felt like I started to understand both math and physics. If you can\u2019t follow, go back to Arfken on Group Theory, or get a group theory book and go through it. Advanced Math. In this category, I include advanced Real Analysis (Rudin), functional analysis, and topology/geometry. There\u2019s a Topology and Geometry for Physicists book, but the other two are better off coming from mathematicians\u2019 POV. Feynman. Reviewing the Feynman lectures on physics can present another viewpoint for physics. Often people say it\u2019s a good place to review physics they already mostly understand. Necessary Stuff Part Four Advanced Electrodynamics. You should use Jackson, and Landau\u2019s book on Classical Fields is also good. Advanced Quantum Mechanics. If you already have Shankar down, go to Landau and Lifshitz. Advanced Statistical Mechanics. Landau and Lifshitz. The Good Stuff Matrix Analysis by Bhatia. A lot of what he covers is also extendable to Hilbert spaces. Quantum Field Theory by Schroeder. Electives. Whatever you\u2019re interested in, learn deeply. You\u2019re now at the point where you should be learning from recent textbooks and from papers. Things like Relativity or Density Functional Theory or Many-body Physics or String Theory.  Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Why study without a teacher?  Seems like you're setting a pretty hard uphill battle for yourself.  Physics is a tough course of study and having someone to bounce ideas off of or at least ask questions to really helped me through it. But, if you must, here's what I'd recommend, and likely in this order: A good single-variable calculus text.  I can't recommend one, but I used Hughes-Hallet's.  Seems pretty specific to Arizona, though.Halliday and Resnick/Halliday Resnick and Krane - Intro to physics, with calculus.  Go through both volumes.Multivariable calculus.  You'll need it, trust me.Marion's Classical Dynamics.  You need something between Halliday and Goldstein, and this is a popular one.Griffiths' Electrodynamics.  A good intro to Maxwell's equations.Lay - Linear Algebra  Hecht, Optics.  A classic, but not as dense as Born & Wolf.Griffiths' Quantum MechanicsKittel and Kroemer - Thermal PhysicsArfken and Weber - Mathematical Methods for PhysicistsBevington and Robinson - Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences (I am an experimentalist, after all)The Feynman Lectures on Physics (good as a reference and to deepen understanding)Ok, so that was undergraduate.  It's good at this point to see if you understand anything in Landau and Lifshitz.  If not L&L OR Feynman, go back and review particular subjects until you get it. As for graduate school, even with a master's degree, at a bare minimum, you'll need (in no particular order): Goldstein's Classical MechanicsJ.D. Jackson's Electrodynamics (the Big Red/Blue/Green Bible).  Fulvio Melia's companion text is also super-helpful in this study, but will not stand alone.Sakurai's Quantum MechanicsHuang's Statistical Mechanics, along with Frederick's intro in the subjectRybicki & Lightman's work on Radiative Processes in Astrophysics (good for any radiation detection/simulation work)This should give you a good grounding in basic fields that every physicist *should* know.  After that, you'll need more texts for specific fields, depending on what you want to learn about. ",
