            "answer_text": "Knowledge and experience are actually two different things. Think of it this way. Knowing something is like having a tool. Experience is like knowing how to use that tool. When you learn something for the first time from a book, that's equipping yourself with a new tool. When you go out and do something that requires the use of that tool, you are forming a cognitive association between a memory and the use of that knowledge. Our brains work by associations. The more associations we have of something in our head, the more it will be accessible (the strength of the association also matters). ",

            "answer_text": "Long ago when books didn't exist, it was experience that produced knowledge which was afterwards written down. books are just records of the knowledge that may have already become outdated. even in our daily life we notice that professionals like Dr., Accountants & scientists are constantly add new information from experience to enrich the learning derived from book. experience is indispensable even for making use of the knowledge derived from books. or life is dynamic and full of surprising inconsistencies that require an intelligent analysis and logical selection. it is not surprising therefor people who rely exclusively on books for knowledge become object or ridicule as impractical pedants. ideally books are to be utilized for spadework leading to knowledge. the attainment of knowledge comes only after experience.
