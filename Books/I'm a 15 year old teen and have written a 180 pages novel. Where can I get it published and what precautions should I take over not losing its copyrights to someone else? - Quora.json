            "answer_text": "I'm breaking down my answer in two parts. Part 1 : Copyrights This must be your first completed manuscript and the fear of someone stealing your content is obvious. I have experienced the same futile fear. Now, futile because unless you share it with an author without a conscience or imagination or a friend who's hell bent on backstabbing you, your precious idea and content should not get stolen. Still I will suggest that you share the complete manuscript only with people you trust completely. If you feel my justification for 'futile fear' wasn't convincing enough, you can always approach a lawyer and get the copyrights for your work. You can visit the Copyright website of Govt. of India (Copyright Office) and check out the processing fees as well. I haven't done it myself, but looks like a copyright should cost you around 6K. Part 2 : Publishing There are two ways of getting published - a. Traditional You can submit your manuscript directly to Publishers. However, they hardly entertain a newbie's manuscript unless it's got incredible selling potential or the author is already a renowned personality. Also, they make you wait for months with no communication in between at all. You'll turn 18 till you get chosen by a traditional publisher. Just kidding. But, it's a waiting game and does test your patience. For selecting the right publishers for your book, visit a book store and check the books of your genre and their publishers. Collect their mail ids. Now, each publisher wants a specific set of documents to be submitted in your Proposal mail. These include : i) Synopsis of book  ii) Bio-data and any past published work if any iii) Sample chapters iv) USP of the book, Targeted audience and marketing strategies if any Prepare above four documents with sufficient care and detail. Take your time. It's a one time effort and you can use the subset to create multiple proposal mails based on the publisher's needs. You can check the desired documents for a proposal on publisher's website. It varies from publisher to publisher. Some don't ask for sample chapters in proposal mail. Also submit your work to Literary agents. They are the middlemen between an author and the publishing houses, who help you seal the best deal. These are people who are either editors or have been in the publishing industry for long. Approaching a literary agent/ literary agency is similar to approaching a publisher. You need to send them a proposal mail as well. If a literary agent is interested and agrees to make you their client, then you have struck the gold. These guys then market your manuscript to publishers. And being backed by a reputed agent is certain to pave the way for your book. b. Self-publishing To put it precisely, if you can pay for it, you can publish it. There are established self-publishing houses which offer you a range of plans and you can choose depending on your budget. These plans usually start from 20K till 60-70K. Since I was in a hurry to get published, I chose self-publishing for my first book. I published with Partridge (Self-publishing branch of Penguin), but it affected my book's market price, which was eventually launched at 430 Rs. on Flipkart. So, I will strictly suggest you to publish with an Indian self-publishing house like NotionPress to price your book competitively. I would never want my book to cost more than 100 Rs. Also, do your background research properly before zeroing in on the publisher. Visit their FB page, talk to authors who have published with them already and gauge their experience. Now, the entire cost to self-publish your book comes around 30-40K. You're 15 years old, so probably not earning right now. And it's not a small amount either for your parents to invest. So, do ask yourself whether you really want to publish it so badly that you can't live in peace. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a novel. This is, at best, a novella. Novels are 80,000 words and higher. Novels are determined by word-count, not page-count. You will not \u201close\u201d the copyright to this, no matter how many mistakes you make. The US is a signatory to the Bern Copyright Convention, which states that the moment you wrote this, it was automatically in copyright, and that can\u2019t be taken from you, it can only be signed away. If you are still concerned about this, mail a paper copy to yourself, and don\u2019t open it, just put it away in a drawer. The postmark will prove the date it was written, establishing you are the original writer from that date on. But don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that copyright on a story means a copyright on an idea. If you see \u201cyour idea\u201d written out elsewhere, in a TV series, a movie, or another book, but the actual words are not yours, it just means you had the same idea as someone else. You cannot copyright ideas. You can only copyright the work that goes into turning an idea into a story. How badly do you want this? I just started being sent to YA book festivals by Disney, and there are a lot of teens like you. The \u201ckids\u201d I\u2019ve been meeting who have been published are driven to write, the way young ballet dancers are driven to dance, young Olympians are driven to excel, young musicians are driven to perform. That means most of their free time is taken up in study and practice\u2026and most of your free time will be taken up with the same. These \u201cbooks\u201d of yours, professionally speaking, are going to suck, and I can tell you that without even seeing them. Why? For the same reason that a 15-year-old who has just begun learning to play the bassoon sucks. No matter what you\u2019ve heard, no one, no one, who has just begun writing is good at it. You don\u2019t have books\u2014you have rough drafts. Probably three to four times as much work as you put into writing each one of these will go into revising and polishing it. So how badly do you want this? Can you take criticism for what it is, correction and something to help, and not an attack on you? One of the things a professional writer learns early and takes to heart is that a professional critique, no matter how harsh, is not a personal attack. And no matter how much you love that sentence, that paragraph, that chapter, if a pro editor or pro author says it\u2019s crap, well, it\u2019s crap. What\u2019s more, your book stopped being \u201cyours\u201d the second you let someone else read it. Let it go, Elsa. It\u2019s not your heart, it\u2019s not your child, it\u2019s something you made, and if you made it badly, you need to understand this is true in order to understand how to fix it or how to write the next one better. If you can\u2019t take criticism that is going to rip your book to shreds, don\u2019t go into this. Because if you think editors are bad, hoo boy, wait until you see what your fellow teens who are not your friends are going to say about it. So can you handle harsh criticism? Are you willing to work at a career and writing at the same time? Here\u2019s the cold, hard truth. Only 10% of the membership of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America makes a living at writing, and of that 10%, half are also in things like journalism and technical writing, and of that 10%, 9% are just making an ordinary living (we call this being \u201chigh midlist\u201d writers). The same is true in every other genre\u2014probably things are even harder in mainstream writing. What this means is, like it or not, you are going to have to have a day-job, and write in your spare time. Which means, like it or not, like everyone else in your class, you need to start thinking and planning for what you are going to be doing for the rest of your life besides writing. Can you do that? If the answer to all of those things is \u201cyes,\u201d then you\u2019re ready for a long, hard, but rewarding, time. If the answer to any of them is \u201cno\u201d\u2014then keep writing stories for your friends if you want, and maybe when you get older you\u2019ll be ready to try again. ",
