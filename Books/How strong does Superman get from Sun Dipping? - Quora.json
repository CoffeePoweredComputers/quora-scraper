            "answer_text": "Depends on the version. The early John Byrne version of Superman could not sun dip. In fact the Eradicator once tried and almost succeeded in killing Superman by throwing him into the Sun. When the Our Worlds at War came, Superman was forced to sun dip and he emerged this way\u2026    So this was Superman travel and basically his first attempt at Sun Dipping. And what happened to him shows how far from his true potential he lives.  And so he emerged! With a power that could threaten both Brainiac 13 and Imperiex.   So he took a direct attack from Imperiex core form and survived. Not only that Imperiex basically says Superman had more than enough power to kill Brainiac and destroy Warworld.     So a sun dip Superman was able to push Warworld to a period right before the Big Bang. True that he had help to take it to that period, but he was able to survive when supposedly there was no time and space, and just pure entropy. So that alone represents a huge increase in power seeing he only spent a few minutes inside the Sun. For example in DC One Million, Superman spends 70.000 years traveling through the cosmos and beyond it. And then he spends the next 15.000 years inside Earth's sun.  And this is how he looked like when he exited it! As for his power level and powers, we can only mostly compare them to those of Kal Kent who was much weaker than Superman-Prime. Although Kal Kent power set was this: Stronger than a collapsed star aka Black HoleFaster than a TachyonAble to jump from one planet to anotherHad all the normal kryptonian powers only on a much higher levelHe was invulnerable to everything, red sun, kryptonite, even magicHe had 10 extra senses. From this extra senses came powers as Telepathy, Telekinesis, 5th dimensional powersHe had force vision and force blastsQuantum energy powersHe was even able to punch his way through time itself back to the future although he was in a severally weakened state.Capable of running several billions of simultaneous scenarios in his mind at the same timeAnd still Kal Kent was weaker than Superman-Prime. So that alone tells us a lot. But there were some hints at Superman-Prime true power. Here's some\u2026  So apparently if he wanted to he could've saved an entire universe from being destroyed if he was only made aware of the situation earlier.  This explains what Superman-Prime did during those 15.000 years inside the Sun. He was always willing to give to his descendants in case of need, powers far beyond any held by any metahuman, EVER. Powers that were gleaned from the very edge of space and time. And lastly we got the All Star Superman version. That once he was forced to fly too close to the Sun, his powers were enhanced at least by three times, while also gaining other powers. For a time it seemed he had suffered a lethal dosage of solar energy and was dying. But as it turns out he was actually going through a metamorphosis turning him into pure energy and mind.  So this version never sun dipped. He just came too close to its surface. Still\u2026  That immediately gave him not just one new power\u2026  \u2026but two!  His power level was also enhanced to at the very least the triple of what it was before.  Here he states that his mind was also expanded.  He became immune to green kryptonite  Here we are told just what was happening to Superman.  And here we see the process already in place and evolving  That allowed Superman to actually dive into the sun turned into a blue star by Solaris, and turn it back into a yellow star. And there he would remain\u2026  \u2026until he fixed the \u201cheart\u201d of the sun. And these are it. All versions of Superman who have sun dipped and were changed by it. New 52 Superman also traveled to the heart of the Sun, but he was unchanged by it. It took much more powerful things to really change him. Like when he gets infected with Doomsday DNA and it's by traveling through Black Holes that his power was boosted enough for him to clean his body from the parasitic DNA. Something not even the Earth sun could do.  As you can see New 52 Superman states without a doubt that he had traveled to the heart of Sun and only came back stronger from the experience. He was not changed at all by doing it. Unlike with the other versions. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently in the Canon we were shown how strong Superman can be when he plunges into the Sun. In justice League # 25 after regaining its power by diving into a yellow Sun Superman decides to fly at a speed only described as beyond all imagination to cross multiple Suns.  So, Superman flew to MFTL through other stars, many like to say \"Superman got the power of thousands of suns\" but Superman never absorbed the stars completely, it just went through them. Basically MFTL = Very little time within each star, basically Nanoseconds, or Attoseconds within each star, this is very basic and easy to understand, but many people lack common sense. This is as absurd as saying that someone had to go through many chimneys to warm up, when all they needed was to stay in a single fireplace for a longer period of time. The increase in power was massive that is obvious, but the amount of solar energy it absorbed was very little in reality. So, it doesn't matter if there were thousands or millions of Suns, it just took a few seconds to get to where World Forger was, to hit it. Which means that in reality everything is equivalent to being only a few seconds within a single Sun, due to the speed at which it traveled and it took to arrive.      Then a single stroke of Superman Sun Dipping iso this with a single stroke ... \u2022 Defeated World Forger basically a Multiversal being. \u2022 Destroyed the Multiverse that World Forger had created as collateral damage, that is, World Forger absorbed the entire blow, it was the shock wave that destroyed that Multiverse. \u2022 It broke a part of the sixth dimension, also as collateral damage, basically the Superman coup caused an omnidirectional shock wave that razed a Multiverse and a part of the sixth dimension, which was confirmed to be an omniverse.  So, Superman Sun Dipping (with only a few seconds of yellow Sun really) is strong enough to defeat a Multiversal being, raze a Multiverse and break a part of an omniverse. Basically Superman is on a Multiversal scale when he gets the Sun Dipping. ",
