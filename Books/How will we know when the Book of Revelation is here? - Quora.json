            "answer_text": "Revelation is here already Revelation 13 started in 1981 at the presidential inauguration of Ronald Reagan and ended and with paragraph 18 let those who have wisdom figure this out and six six six is six alphabets in each name the first middle and last that would be Ronald Wilson Reagan The answer is very simple if you understand the meaning of parables, John, who had the vision wanted us, the people in the future to figure this out ourselves the year Parable: (1) Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. John witnessed from behind a massive crowd, a newly elected president\u2019s Inauguration of the 40th President of the United States, (Barter system no longer method of trade, sell or buy) describing U.S. currency, denominations of 7 coins and 10 paper with 10 picture of heads, which said \u201cIn GOD we trust,\u201d Parable: (2) Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. This President I witnessed, was a great speaker and motivator, who made the listen, who\u2019s words carried strength, fulfillment, and leader of the United States, a President with most powerful Armed Forces. Parable: (3) And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. John Witness the assassination attempt of the 40th President, and the injury to James Brady. The world prayed for recovery of the President and James Brady, for the free world loved this President. Parable: (5) & (6) And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. 6Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. On national TV, this 2 term President spoke of building Star Wars defense system in space, and with the crew of Challenger all holding hands over their head, the President said, \u201dlet us go up to the Heavens and touch the Face of GOD\u201d Paragraph 11\u20137 is description of George W Bush the 43rd President Parable: (17) He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. President made sure all people, even on government assistance, have social security number, have money, (an EBT card) and phone, to buy what is needed, except excludes those who have U.S. currency Parable (18) Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. Here is a question, if you walk by faith, you can figure this out, figure out what the name of this president, it is a name of a man, with six alphabets in the first name, six alphabets in the second name, and six alphabets in the third name. Answer: Ronald Wilson Reagan, The hidden meaning, the beginning of John\u2019s vision, 1981. 10 views Upvote Share ",

            "answer_text": "Some of what the book of Revelation is already here. Starting with the first chapter to the 6th chapter and verse 8 is already here. The rest will start being fulfilled shortly within this century probably within the next two decades. To know just pay attention to world news and compare it to the book of Revelation. Similarities of the book and the real world around us will be global. Here is the evidence: The apostle John was given a vision of the Lord's (Jesus) day. \u201cBy inspiration I came to be in the Lord's day\u201d Re (Revelation) 1:10 The first 5 chapters seem to deal with what occurs from the first century C.E. till unspecified time thereafter. Re 1\u20135 This seems to be the case becase John was told to write down \u201cthe things that are\u201d that were then present during the 1st century into the future when the Lord's day would begin. So some things in Revelation that John recorded were already present. Those things we're recorded in the first 5 chapters The sixth chapter reveals things that have been noticeable during modern times since the early 20th century C.E. when the Lord's day began. The ride of the 4 horsemen. The white horse rider is given a crown, indicating his then appointment as a king. He also has a bow and goes forth conquering. Jesus is a king and white in the Bible often represents righteousness. Also, a bow used for shooting arrows are for distant targets. So righteous spiritual warfare at a distance, by the use of a bow, is carried on by Christ. Jesus carries on righteous conquering in harmony with the will of his father while at a distance in heaven by shooting arrows of offense in behalf of true Christians on earth, by means of holy Spirit and angels. Thus true Christians have often received protection and deliverance from enemies. This has been experienced through persecutions, governmental bans on worship, religious intolerance and in court cases when principles of worship are at the issue. Re 6:2 \u201ca white (righteous) horse (warfare) and that one seated upon it had a bow (of long distance fighting); and a crown (regal or kingly authority) was given (appointed to) him, and he went (came) forth conquering (defeating)\u201d The 2nd horseman rides a fiery-colored horse. Fire often represents heat and destruction in Scripture. Therefore, have we not seen or even perhaps experienced heated warfare over hot political, commercial, and even religious issues during our modern times. Yes, the \u201chorse\u201d of warfare has marched and traveled by tanks, aircraft carriers, fighter planes and ground troops, etc! The rider is mankind in general. Has not peace been taken away from the world since early in the 20th century, starting with world war I? Yes, the ride of this spiritual horseman has been felt all over the \u201cearth\u201d, so the sign is global. Unlike the use of a bow at a distance this rider has a sword, which is for close combat. Therefore this rider wields his warring influence while on earth, up close and personal. No doubt this rider, mankind, is of Satanic origin, who himself is described as a \u201cfiery-colored dragon\u201d. Re 12:3 Re 6:4 \u201ca fiery-colored (destructive or heated) horse (warefare); and to the one seated upon it there was granted to take peace away from the earth (worldwide) so that they (humanity) should slaughter one another; and a great sword (large and earthwide fighting and war) was given him.\u201d The 3rd horseman rides a black horse. The \u201chorse\u201d of famine marches from country to country. It's rider is also mankind. The sanctions, tariffs and other political policies have affected famine in other lands. Black often indicates famine, which often is a residual consequence of war. Have we not heard of or seen an unprecedented degree of famine, by food shortage and starvation, globally since world war I? In ancient times and even today food is weighed by scales. This rider has to do with the rationing and distributing of food. During the apostles time wheat, barley, olive oil and wine were food staples. During our modern times all foods, including staples, have become more and more expensive. The \u201cwheat\u201d as the more expensive and \u201cbarley\u201d as the less expensive has affected both the rich and the poor. Global inflation abounds. There is much mismanagement of the food sources of the earth by both government and the commercial industry. At such a time humanity needs \u201colive oil\u201d as a soothing or comforting elements and \u201cwine\u201d to give them something for which to rejoice under such dire circumstances. Comforting security and true meaningful rejoicing are hard to come by. This too is a result of demonic activity because of the cause of war and the influence of ensuring mankind to continue and increase in selfishness and greed. Again, this too is earth wide. Re 6:5, 6 \u201ca black (famine) horse (march); and the one seated upon it had a pair of scales (rationing instrument) in his hand\u2026A quart of wheat (more expensive staple) for a denarius (a years wage), and three quarts of barley (less expensive staple) for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil (comfort food) and the wine (joy producing drink).\u201d The 4th horseman rides a pale horse. Living things that are discribed as pale are usually diseased. So this horse represents a pandemic of global plagues, which often follow famine. War causes famine and famine leads to plagues. This is also caused by the ride of mankind. Ergo, plagues lead to death also and that is the name of the forth rider. When a person dies he or she is buried in the grave, that is Hades. Such \u201cauthority\u201d or power of control can only be of Satanic origin. A quarter of the planet is to be affected by deadly disease. Mankind has been ravaged by cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, brain aneurysms, STDs, bird flu, ebola and many more during one time or another. Diseases and resulting death has been over extensive periods of time, for some diseases have proven incurable and they have had far reaching influence from one country to another and far reaching affects in that some are congenial diseases passed on through conception. These two even use wild beasts the kill humans. Has mankind not been killed by many beasts of the earth, some of which cause death by disease, such as malaria? This last horseman collects everything in the wake of the aftermath of the two previous horsemen. Hades, the grave collects all casualties. The ultimate reality of the ride of three of the four horsemen is death. The influence of the rider that causes war, famine and plagues that lead to death have been through the selfish and attitudes and actions of mankind. Humanity has developed a warring attitude, have mismanaged food because of economic and political agendas, and contributed to circumstances that cause disease and death. Re 6:8 \u201ca pale (plague/disease) horse (march); and the one seated upon it had the name Death (end of life)\u2026.Hades (the common grave) was closely following him\u2026authority was given them over the fourth part (25\u2105, 1/4, .25, a quarter) of the earth, to kill with a long (extended or far reaching) sword and with for shortage (lack of available food) and with deadly plague (terminal disease) and by the wild beasts (animals and beast-like people and governments) of the earth (worldwide).\u201d But, there is hope! How so? Remember the first rider, of the white horse, Jesus? Let us go back to what the verse says about what he will eventually accomplish. Re 6:2 \u201ccomplete his conquest\u201d Other Scriptures indicate that Jesus will not remain in heaven to complete his conquest with a \u201cbow\u201d. The book of Revelation in chapter 19 verses 14 & 15 show that he will leave heaven handling a \u201csword\u201d, which is for close combat, and rid the earth of those who cause war, famine, disease and death and those who condone them. Jesus will complete his conquest by ridding the earth of the other three horseman and those who allow themselves to be influenced by them in ways that oppose God. He will eventually stop all wars, end famine, disease and death. Re 19:11, 13 \u201cI saw the heaven (sky) opened, and look! A white (righteous) horse (warfare). And the one seated upon it (the Lord Jesus Christ)\u2026carries on war in righteousness\u2026he is called The Word (spokesman) of God.\u201d Re 19:14, 15 \u201cAlso, the armies (troops) that were in heaven (the spirit realm) were following (accompanying in support of) him on white (righteous) horses (warfare)\u2026out of his mouth (power to command) there protrudes (extensive) a sharp (penetrating) long (far reaching) sword (close combat), that he may strike (cut down) the nations with it\u201d Revelation chapter 6:9 - 22 and the rest of the book of Revelation seems to be yet future. But, these events of chapter are extremely close to starting and when they begin they will happen in relatively rapid succession. Please, stay tuned to Bible prophecy and world events. Beginning in Revelation 6:9 is about the aftermath of an insidious plot to wipe out Christianity, wherein some are killed because of the Bible and the message that they preached. But Christ will eventually come to the rescue by cutting that period short and later bringing on Armageddon of Revelation 6:11, 16, 17; 16:14, 16; 19:11-21. ",
