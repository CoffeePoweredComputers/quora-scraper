            "answer_text": "By writing Fahrenheit 451, what could Bradbury have been saying about the hold, or lack of it, the government has on the people? He was saying nothing about government, nothing about the hold it might have on the people, nothing about censorship. He was talking about television. In an interview with Amy E. Boyle Johnson back in 2007, Bradbury is very clear that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 about how television destroys interest in reading literature. He is clear that the book is not about government, censorship, or McCarthyism. \u201cNow, Bradbury has decided to make news about the writing of his iconographic work and what he really meant. Fahrenheit 451 is not, he says firmly, a story about government censorship. Nor was it a response to Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose investigations had already instilled fear and stifled the creativity of thousands. This, despite the fact that reviews, critiques and essays over the decades say that is precisely what it is all about. Even Bradbury\u2019s authorized biographer, Sam Weller, in The Bradbury Chronicles, refers to Fahrenheit 451 as a book about censorship. Bradbury, a man living in the creative and industrial center of reality TV and one-hour dramas, says it is, in fact, a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature. \u201cTelevision gives you the dates of Napoleon, but not who he was,\u201d Bradbury says, summarizing TV\u2019s content with a single word that he spits out as an epithet: \u201cfactoids.\u201d He says this while sitting in a room dominated by a gigantic flat-panel television broadcasting the Fox News Channel, muted, factoids crawling across the bottom of the screen. \u201cHis fear in 1953 that television would kill books has, he says, been partially confirmed by television\u2019s effect on substance in the news. The front page of that day\u2019s L.A. Times reported on the weekend box-office receipts for the third in the Spider-Man series of movies, seeming to prove his point. \u201c\u201cUseless,\u201d Bradbury says. \u201cThey stuff you with so much useless information, you feel full.\u201d He bristles when others tell him what his stories mean, and once walked out of a class at UCLA where students insisted his book was about government censorship. He\u2019s now bucking the widespread conventional wisdom with a video clip on his Web site (https://www.raybradbury.com/at_home_clips.html), titled \u201cBradbury on censorship/television.\u201d\u201d Sadly, the link in the article to the video does not work. Perhaps the video was taken down after he died? Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted - LA Weekly ",

            "answer_text": "Very little. The unique thing about 451 is that, if you believe Beatty (and I don't see a reason not to), the society in the book isn't the creation of at tyrannical government like nearly every other dystopia, it's a direct result of the will of the people. We don't know much about the politics, but there's no indication of a radical shift in the governmental structure of the country. I would argue that Bradbury wasn't concerned with the hold of government over the people, but rather more about the mob's hold on the government. Democracy is every bit a terrifying thing as a dictatorship - just spend some time with the average voter. ",
