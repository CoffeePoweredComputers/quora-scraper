            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to prepare for. If you are talking about obtaining good marks for the NCERT exams then NCERT physics book is really good and provides in depth knowledge for most of the topics. If you want to score well in some competitive exams then it is imperative that you practice the concepts learned from the NCERT physics book. For that I would suggest you start with H.C. Verma. Try to go through the book at least twice and solve each an every question. Then you can move on to DC Pandey. Don't forget to plan well and execute those plan with your 100% efforts and dedication. Hope this helps! ! Good luck !! ",
