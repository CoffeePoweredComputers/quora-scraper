            "answer_text": "I am not discouraging you but once someone goes online they find all about they know via google search, forums, using e-books and sharing on social media . People are less leaning towards paper edition of books nowadays due to prices, rental fee, saftey of book from climate to insects, and laking space in small houses. So think again about your idea.
