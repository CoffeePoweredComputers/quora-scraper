            "answer_text": "I'm not sure how many responses here would justify the statement that something is \"normal\" among twins, but personally speaking, I don't remember creating any imaginary characters between me and my twin. My mom says the two of us used to talk to each other in gibberish before an adult could understand anything we said between us. Maybe that counts as some sort of \"role-play\". But as far as my memory has it, all the best friends of our childhood were all real-life friends.  --Maybe this is why neither me nor my brother ever showed any gift in creative fields such as acting and arts.

As children we even had an imaginary \"robot\" named \"Clancy\" that lived in our basement!  As for acting \"stupidly,\" this is not only normal but absolutely essential!  The best times I ever had were the two of us laughing uncontrollably at stupid, imaginary stuff that made no one laugh but us.  People thought we were crazy; maybe they were right. ",
