            "answer_text": "Some do, but I question the trade-off between speed and comprehension or enjoyment. I\u2019m not impressed by someone who can read all of Shakespeare in one day. I found this: Not only does reading a sentence take some time, but comprehending it does too. The average person reads approximately 200-300 words per minute, which may sound like a lot but compared to most speed readers, it is nothing. Speed reading is the practice of reading sentences at a rapid pace. This type of reading doesn t just focus on getting through the words, but understanding what you are reading as well. There is one event, the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, which stresses comprehension while speed reading. Some of the best contestants read 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute and have at least 50 percent or higher comprehension of what they ve read. And yet, Howard Berg reads more than these contestants. Howard Berg is considered the fastest reader in the world. \"The Guinness World Record Book\" recognized Berg in 1990 for his ability to read more than 25,000 words per minute and write more than 100 words per minute. Who is the Fastest Reader in the World? ",
