            "answer_text": "I don't think Nintendo is particularly concerned about IGDA in general.  Or the game development community as a whole. I'm fairly certain that Nintendo's consumer base couldn't care one way or another about GG, given they seem to court younger players and families (Mario, Guitar Hero, Disney games, etc.)  They've released a few AAA titles, but sales of those titles don't compare to the family oriented games. The 3DS is certainly targeting younger users as well. The Nintendo leadership is very Japan oriented as well, and IGDA seems to be far more US/EU focused, so IGDA is likely not on their radar. Should they be concerned?  I think they have bigger issues to deal with right now.  Microsoft is heavily courting smaller and indie developers, and both Microsoft and Sony work closely with a wider range of AAA developers.  And the 3DS simply won't be able to compete with smartphones and mobile games, IMHO. They're feeling the crunch.  And they're becoming less relevant given they've a more limited number of titles. If they decide to open up to a wider range of developers, they may need to turn their eyes towards IGDA to some extent, but I find that unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "The Japanese-developer Nintendo occupies the market targeted for gamers of all ages, including the family and children.  And they are not Western-based developers that came around during the turn of the century, being in the video game market since the 80s and have been defining the notion of video games ever since then.  This little controversial incident is not big enough to warrant Nintendo's concerns unless this is repeatedly happening to many of their employees.  To get Nintendo's attention and concern is to have an incident related to a big game that affects many consumers of Nintendo, like an incident related to Super Smash Bros for example. ",
