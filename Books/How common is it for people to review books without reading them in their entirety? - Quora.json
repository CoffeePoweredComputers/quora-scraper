I've started a book that I've bought/borrowed after being recommended to me by someone ... and half-way through I start thinking that this is an awful lot like...  and then I bail on reading.  Life's too short and the bookpile I have keeps growing.  But as for reviews - yes, done that too.  In my profession I've bought Computer language reference books.  Some good, some bad.  If I can't get what I want out of it, I figure that's worth telling someone else in a review, before they spend their cash.  (I\"m looking at 'Oracle 8 DBA Handbook' in my bookshelf). I've also bought a history book - specifically 'Crucible of War' 'cause I wanted to learn about the Seven Years war in North America.  The author was an American and stuck mainly to the war from the US side (bias...) and by the time I got to page 100 or so - my turning point - I knew what was happening.  And that I couldn't get through the rest of it.  So, I bailed - and published a review saying that it wasn't the book I expected, but instead...   But how common is it?  It's rare for me.  So I guess not so common at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I really don't know if there are any actual statistics on this. You might be able to tell if the reviewer didn't read the entire book if they only focus on the beginning in their review. I would imagine that some professional reviewers would only have time to skim a book. They would miss the nuances but get the gist and feel for it. I know that people like Terry Gross (NPR radio host) have said that the night before an interview they will read the author's book. Not always, but sometimes. When it comes to people who post reviews on sites like Amazon or Goodreads, I really don't know if they can be trusted to have read the entire book or not. Over time you might be able to tell by the sorts of reviews they post. Superficial ones might point to the reviewer not actually having read the book in it's entirely. (Although frankly, I hate it when someone posts a review and it is basically a synopsis. I like to discover the plot on my own and not have someone ruin it for me.) ",
