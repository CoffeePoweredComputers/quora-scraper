            "answer_text": "One small point to add to Todd Gardiner\u2019s answer. In countries that have strong law or tradition regarding moral rights, you need to be aware of complications that can occur from creating a translation. Moral rights - Wikipedia Probably the most important and most commonly recognized moral right is that of the integrity of the work. In places where these rights apply, it means that even after copyright has lapsed, you may be prevented from creating derivative works that alter the nature of the original work. This usually won\u2019t affect you if you are simply printing a copy of the original book, but when you translate a book, you are creating a derivative work. The estate of the author might be able to argue that your translation has in some way tarnished the original work. For this type of case, moral rights are typically not an issue in the US, but you will need a least a little guidance as to the situation in your country. It might be a bit of a stretch to suppose that this could be an issue, but there are some author\u2019s estates that are quite aggressive about protecting their works, and this is one tool they can sometimes use even when their copyright protection has lapsed. -Mark ",

The copyright protections have expired, everyone has the right to do whatever they want with the book. As for your copyright for translating, you automatically get one just by making the translation. Lots of countries offer advantages when you register that copyright with the copyright office, but this is not a required step to being able to defend your work against being copied.
