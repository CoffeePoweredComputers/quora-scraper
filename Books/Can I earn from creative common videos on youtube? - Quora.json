            "answer_text": "If you use CC content, it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t be able to monetize those videos with ads because you aren\u2019t the original creator. If you\u2019re able to build a large subscriber/viewer base, you can set up a crowdfunding account on a site like Patreon and some viewers may support you with small donations.you may be able to find businesses to sponsor your channel.The value of your channel may not be that the content is original, but that it is an aggregation of information on a specific topic. This value is lower if you simply clone an existing CC channel that has all of the same content. Keep in mind that one of the requirements of all CC licenses is attribution. In other words, you have to acknowledge and link back to the original work. I\u2019m assuming that\u2014 you\u2019re using the entire CC videos \u201cas-is,\u201d without changing them. Many CC videos on YouTube consist of content that\u2019s intended to be edited into new content.you\u2019re using CC videos found on YouTube. YouTube allows only one form of CC license, the attribution license. This license allows modifications and commercial use. If you use CC videos from other sources, those videos may be licensed under a more restrictive CC license. Be sure that you\u2019re compliant with the terms of the CC license applied to the videos you use.Creating original content using some CC elements may allow you to monetize your videos with ads, but I\u2019m not 100% certain about that. You would still need to attribute any CC content to the original creators and indicate that you had modified their work to create your video. ",

            "answer_text": "You can earn from anything you post on YouTube. But to activate monetisation on your videos you will need atleast 10k channel views. (Earlier monetisation could be started with 0 views but now YouTube has changed it's policy) After you'll activate monetisation then whenever an advertisement is displayed while your video is being played you will get paid! So if you think using videos with creative common license can get you 10k views, go for it! But you need to be careful while choosing videos with creative common license. Some channels may have copied the content from a standard licensed video and kept that video as a creative common licensed video in their channel. After you upload that video on your channel and if the original creator finds that, you may have a copyright strike! If you get 3 copyright strikes your channel will be terminated! I would advise you to create your original content and earn through it! ",

While that plan is legal, because you specified Creative Commons content, it's not going to work. To qualify for monetization, your channel needs 1,000 subscribers. I don't see that happening. Further, in one years time you need to get 4,000 view-hours. So enough people have to watch videos all the way through to reach that total. And after all that.you get to start running ads. You'll need tens of thousands of new views to make anything bankable. How much do YouTubers make when each of their videos get 50k, 100k, 500k, 1m, and 1.5m views? What about even more than that? Why would people watch videos already found online, no changes made at all? ",
