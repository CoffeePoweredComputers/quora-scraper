            "answer_text": "how do you define \u201cpowers\u201d? because there are some alien races that are simply naturally superior physically to any human. and it doesnt really matter how skilled you are. against an alien with the physiology of a Saiyan, you will just break your hand trying. or a xenomorph with acid for blood even if you make it bleed. i find batman winning virtually impossible for this reason. he can only ever hit as hard as a 6ft humanoid man can. but humans are spindly and weak and fiction has some crazy shit in it. would the room turn Goku into a \u201cregular\u201d Saiyan man? because it wouldnt make him into something hes not ie a human being. if it only turns off ki usage you are still left with a being with such hard skin bulma shot it kid gokus skin and it barely made any dent. batman breaks his hand punching goku\u2019s skin no matter if he has ki or not. even if you depowered everyone to a \u201clevel playing field\u201d once again durability and endurance can overwhelm pure skill. are we turning off biological defects like being unable to feel pain? how are you supposed to put a guy down if he never notices hes getting punched? are we including non humanoids like Terminators? once again bruce breaks his hand punching a terminator. and how about non humanoids who are biologically, functionally, by definititon superior physically to all \u201cnon powered\u201d humans like a Tyrannosaur or something? and if we are including technological advancement as a \u201cpower\u201d then i dont think batman wins that either. he has far from the most OP tech in fiction. faar from it. you should see the kind of amazing shit Eldar from WH4Ok have.

            "answer_text": "Batman for obvious reasons. At many comics, even when the heroes are using their full potential, batman has a contingency plan for everyone and everything. So taking off their powers simply make them more vulnerable to him. To be honest it is very hard to determine whether or not batman is the winner because there are tons of people inside that room but I am still optimistic for Batman. Another character who might win because his powers do not belong to him but to a device, is Ben 10. He is a regular human with no powers. All of his powers are in the device called the \u201cOmnitrix\u201d which is placed on his wrist. I don't know if a device counts here as a power but if it doesn't, Ben has a good chance of winning. Edit: (Assuming that the answer is reffering to every fictional character ever, then omnipotent things win, cause you cannot do anything to omnipotence). ",
