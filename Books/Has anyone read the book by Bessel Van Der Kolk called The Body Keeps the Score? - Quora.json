            "answer_text": "Yes, I have\u2026I\u2019m not a psychologist, and I read the book for personal reasons, and is the most amazing book about \u201cdevelopmental trauma disorder\u201d is like a bible of traumas details and explanations, great work and research by Bessel Van Der Kolk, MD. I had an amazing relationship with an amazing human being, somehow from the beginning I noticed that this girl was different, she had a tender soul, a childish innocence\u2026, like if she had a frozen child inside herself, and I felt that she was a child living inside a grown up woman\u2019s body and that\u2019s exactly of what the books explains in detail, abused victims get frozen or stuck emotionally, they don\u2019t grow or don\u2019t develop themselves to update themselves to their present chronological age, but also shows you how to help these victims\u2026 It\u2019s an amazing book, that everybody should read , to be aware of how mistreatment of infants can do and can affect them later in their adult lives. Good luck, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a lot of answers\u2026!!! ",
