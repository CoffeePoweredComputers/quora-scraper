            "answer_text": "Oh, there are! I go online regularly, pick out a book, and it gets dropped off on my husband\u2019s desk at work. Other options include picking it up at a local location during business hours, or having it delivered to a locker I can access 24/7 using a code I\u2019m sent to unlock it when the book is there and available. I can also rent movies (DVD and digital editions) audio books (on CD or digital editions), and eBooks. Also, it\u2019s 100% free. It\u2019s my local library system. My husband works there - so they know to drop my books at his desk, haha, I\u2019m a little more privileged than most. But seriously, try looking at your library system\u2019s website, or that of your local library. Inter-library loan can get you pretty much any physical book you\u2019re looking for nowadays. ",
