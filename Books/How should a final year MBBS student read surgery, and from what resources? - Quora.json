            "answer_text": "I'm the last person who should be answering this A2A since I really didn't like the subject. I loathed studying surgery. I never could see the point of memorising the steps of appendectomy or learning the stages of different cancers. But I digress. This is how I studied : Make notes. There are many books in the market with a lot of content to read. In final year there are 4 major subjects to read. You cannot afford to give a lot of time to only one subject. Making notes will help you condense so much information and make it easier to revise during exams. As one of my professors used to say: you should know something of everything not the other way around.  Theory Books to read: Bailey's is good for reading some topics like general surgery and genitourinary system. While I used SRB for GIT. Manipal manual is not something I read so I don't have any idea about that. Another thing that I found very useful was bhatia notes for surgery (Jay Arora). Especially for breast and gastrointestinal system. It's very precise and easy to remember for exams( and helps in Pg exams too) So in summary: a mixture of bailey+ srb + jay arora notes with last 10 years papers and you should be fine for theory papers.  Practicals Books to read: there are only two that people read: S dasMakhanlalI didn't read either to be honest. Surgery practicals are a combination of theory and examination of patients. So for practicals, practice and practice the different tests and manuevers on patients. Because if you don't, you end up committing grave erorrs like examining only one side of a hernia case. Read the theory and practice multiple times on patients. That's all they really expect in surgery practicals.  Hope this was informative enough. ",
