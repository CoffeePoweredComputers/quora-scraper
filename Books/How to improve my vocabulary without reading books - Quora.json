            "answer_text": "English series and movies. Go for the British ones as I think that there is less slang involved. Either way\u2026 you need to know the meaning of the word to comprehend the sentence(which can also be done by understanding the context, but you don't really get the exact thing at times).. so as long as you don't mind pausing the video every time you need to know the meaning of some new word- go for it. And I have one question here, why not books? You could actually start with some catchy and easy to read books and you will still learn so many words. :) ",
