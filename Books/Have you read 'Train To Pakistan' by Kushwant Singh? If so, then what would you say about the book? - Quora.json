            "answer_text": "I have just finished the novel. Very interesting. I have a habit of considering South Asian literature as elemsee(el-em-see ie Lower Middle Class) but the novel forced me to keep reading it on and on till I finished it. Originally I was studying \u201cIce-candy-man (Cracking India)\u201d our teacher suggested us \u201cTrain to Pakistan\u201d by khushwant Singh and \u201cDera Tek Singh\u201d by Minto for further reading. Originally I was sceptical about the novel being written by a non-Pakistani. But I decided to read it nonetheless for I was sure Sir is not going to suggest an anti-Pakistan narrative. As far as the novel is concerned, it was a bit boring or rather - jarring at places where I felt why I am wasting my time; but overall the narrative is neatly woven. A fragile topic treated excellently with nearly neutral approach to most of the events. Last scene of train is quiet unreal but theme is good. Characters and their motivations are drawn out intrinsically; all characters are grey. No character is utterly good or vice-incarnated but sudden changes of fortune are quite unprobable. But the story is good and we can't label it as anti-Pakistan or biased in favour of Sikhs which is its most defining feature. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 ",

            "answer_text": "It's an epic fiction novel, written by khushwant Singh.  He explained beautifully the people and their grievances during partition time. He took the stories around the border village called mano majra, which was basically a sikh majority village and how the people there reacted when they were told to throw out all the muslim living near-by them. Their innocence and unity at the end turned out to be the major boost leaving all the suppression behind. It also depicted how the power centric people of that time used to induce their corrupt motive into the innocent people to execute their ideas. The magistrate, sub-inspector and the head constable in the story are shown with the utmost power. The magistrate with his personal obsession of drinking and prostitution are shown here. His obsessed and good sides are also shown parallel. The Inter-caste love story of Juggat singh and Nooran are beautiful drawn here. Police men just for the sake of maintaining peace have the power to arrest anyone without a proper authentic warrant. How villager reacted when they found the train full of corpse of their neighbouring muslims and the retaliation they choose on this. The expressions and the reactions of people are drawn with such details to let you create an exact image of the same in your mind. The story is conclued amazingly at the end. So if you want to peep into the past beliefs and to feel their deep grief, then must read this epic. Cheers\u270d\ufe0f ",
