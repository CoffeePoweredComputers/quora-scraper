            "answer_text": "On Goodreads, go to your Account Settings, then click on Apps. Here you will see all of your linked apps, like facebook, twitter, or whatever you have linked. This would be the page where you turn off the \u201cshare to FB\u201d option. However, it seems there has been a recent update: As Facebook no longer supports automatic sharing of activities from third party apps or websites, Goodreads members are now unable to automatically share activities to their Facebook timelines. Find out how you can still share individual books to Facebook here. So, Goodreads should not be automatically sharing anything to FB any more. If your activity is still being shared to FB, contact Goodreads support at Contact Us and let them know about the bug. ",
