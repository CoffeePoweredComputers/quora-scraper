            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, \"yes.\"  However, the real answer in many cases is going to be a more complicated \"no.\" When you access an instant video you receive limited rights regarding the video, only a few of the entire bundle of rights that comprise a full copyright ownership.  So you know you can't copy the video and distribute it, for instance.  You can, of course, view it, that's what you paid for in the first place.  The thing is, you can really only do what iTunes and Amazon can let you and do let you do.  Confused?  Let me break it down. The copyright owners of the movies license their films to Apple or Amazon.  The license allows Apple and Amazon to distribute the film to you.  But Apple and Amazon don't own the exclusive rights to the film, only limited rights.  So they can't sell you the exclusive rights when they don't have them in the first place.  Furthermore, Apple isn't going to sell their distribution rights to you, that's why they paid for the distributorship in the first place.  So in essence, through this funneling of rights, you get the least amount of rights.  If you exceed those rights, you have infringed on the film owner's copyright.   But that's not the end of the inquiry.  Apple and Amazon both have terms of service, that really long scroll of legalese that no one bothers to read but is still enforceable in court that people click to accept.  If you do take the time to read through it, you will find out what exactly you can do with the instant videos you watch.  And it's pretty restrictive.  Some of the restrictions are there to protect copyright, other restrictions are there just so Apple and Amazon can make more money, and some restrictions kind of bridge the gap between the two.  DRM is one of those bridge the gap kind of measures.  The terms of service usually protect the DRM measures too.  So while removing the DRM isn't necessarily unlawful, you probably agreed not to remove it and if you do, then you've breached your contract and those companies could throw the book at you (not saying they will, only that they could). tl;dr  Yes, unless you contractually agree not to, which you usually will 99% of the time, and even then, you still have to be careful not to infringe on copyrights.
