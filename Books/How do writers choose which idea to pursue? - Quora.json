            "answer_text": "Well, for me, it\u2019s all about what really ignites my curiosity. If I have to choose between two ideas, I pursue the one that seems to have the richer content for the story. Sometimes I don\u2019t know until I research the topic thoroughly. Sometimes I don\u2019t know until I start working on it. Occasionally an idea just doesn\u2019t go anywhere compelling, in which case I leave it and pursue the next idea for a while. My Great Library series took a total of 10 years, off and on, to develop to where I could actually write it and do justice to the idea. I probably started different approaches four times during that decade before finding the one that finally worked. All of which is to say, there\u2019s not really a roadmap, or a hard-and-fast process for me. Some things click immediately. Some things take years. It\u2019s really hard to know. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, I simply choose a place or a topic with which I am familiar. If asked, I probably could write a nice story about Cincinnati, Ohio, but since I have never visited there, I would have to do a lot of dull research. On the other hand I could sit down now and write you a story about Thelma, Texas where I once lived for a few months. ",
