            "answer_text": "Been there, done that. I had this idea for a story, and I just started to write it down. Spent a year or more. Then I joined a writers\u2019 group. We would meet once a week (and I\u2019ve been doing this for nearly a decade) and someone\u2019s work would be critiqued. I learned a lot, and became a better writer. What\u2019s in it for me? Well, if I can find an agent, I might get it published. But just learning the skills of becoming a good writer has been an interesting and mostly fun experience. But I got tired of editing my first novel. It was almost perfect, but I was in the 50th major revision (the file names are names like story1.docx, story2.docx, and I last saved story50.docx) [for \u201cstory\u201d substitute something meaningful, such as \u201cnonmetallic 17.docx\u201d or \u201cvampoid 23.docx\u201d]. But I knew the story was good. It sat there for almost two years; last summer, I decided to tackle it again. As I was reading the first few chapters, the thought flitted through my mind, \u201cWho wrote this crap?\u201d. Then I remembered who wrote it. I had become a much better writer in the intervening two years. That is a very satisfying experience, and I feel that my life is richer for having become an author. So that\u2019s the benefit. I wrote two very technical books on programming. Given the number of hours I spent, and the royalties I receive, I think I am now up to about $0.17/hour for my labors. But that wasn\u2019t the benefit. The benefit was that I got hired to do work because I was obviously very knowledgeable in programming, and the work that I got turned into a fairly large amount of money over the next 20 years. So the secondary income took me from $0.17/hour to about $100/hour for the time invested in writing those books. If you don\u2019t understand what the benefit is to you, don\u2019t bother. But be aware that the benefits you get may be only realized once you are recognized for what you have done. And they may not be financial. The trick is to write it and get it published. You will be most successful if you find a group of like-minded authors around you, and who have gathered as a group to critique each others\u2019 work. And check your ego at the door. I once pointed out to an author, on her first submission to the group, that she had a clumsy sentence that demanded parallel structure, and she had not used parallel structure, which made it hard to understand. She went ballistic on me. How dare I take exception to a sentence she wrote? When another member told her that she had some continuity problems and some character problems, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been reading your crap for months, and it is boring as hell, and you have the arrogance to criticize my work?\u201d She was disinvited from the group. I said that she should not be allowed to return until she apologized to the group as a whole, and to the author she yelled at, but she never returned. And good riddance. Writing is a craft, and a craft can only be learned from those who already do it. Our group has several published authors in it, and I am proud to say that I helped get those stories good enough to get published. And they are helping me improve mine. There is benefit just in the act of writing it. ",
