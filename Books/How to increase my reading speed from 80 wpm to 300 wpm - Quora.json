            "answer_text": "There is a great disparity as to what reading speeds can be achieved if you do your research on the Internet. However, if you are accurately starting at 80wpm, you should be able to reach your goal, regardless of the scales you find in your research. How do you read faster? Don\u2019t physically move your lips when you read (the concept is called sub-vocalization) as if you were sounding out the words. This is one of the biggest steps in slowing down your reading. While some experts will tell you that some sub-vocalization is a good thing, do not move your lips while reading.When you read something - read it and move to the next word. Moving back to re-read a word is called regression and is another of the big slow-downs in reading.Reading is all about letter and word recognition, so the more vocabulary you know, the easier it will be to recognize the words as you read them. The faster you recognize the word, the more your speed will increase.As others who have answered have also encouraged, READ! There is no substitute to reading - it exposes you to new words, new phrases and gives you more practice in recognizing them. The more quickly you recognize the word, its meaning and how it affects the document (article, email, story or book) that you are reading, the faster you will become. Look on the Internet for free tools to help you read: there a lots to choose from. Overcome the first two items above and then increase your vocabulary (add a word or two in your field or simply from a dictionary every day) and you will get faster! Go for it! Read the correct way and you will get better, continuing to sub-vocalize and regress and, no matter how much you read, you will still not be as fast as you could. ",
