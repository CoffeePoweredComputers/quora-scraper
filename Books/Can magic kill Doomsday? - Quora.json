EDIT: I've also just realize that the same form of magic, but more potent than the one before it, could potentially kill Doomsday. Even though Doomsday once clinically died via blunt force trauma at the hands of Superman, it doesn't mean that he can't die by blunt force again; it would just take blunt force more powerful than the one that killed him before.
