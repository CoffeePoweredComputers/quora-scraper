It is an Information Security managerial exam. Yet \u2013 a managerial exam interesting to hear different people\u2019s perspectives. Risk managers, compliance officers, and managers will tell you it\u2019s a very technical exam. While engineers, architects, and other techies will tell you it\u2019s not very technical. According to the CISSP Expert, Eric Conrad, author of CISSP Study Guide (2015) \u2013 CISSP is a managerial exam. This is very important to know when preparing for the exam as questions are not formatted logically as you would see in other IT Security exams.CISSP is a significant investment in time and money so you need to weigh this up with your circumstances to determine how best to meet these investments. Step Two \u2013 Know the Exam! 250 questions 25 questions are experimental and not graded. Which questions these are is unknown. The pass mark is 700 out of 1000 \u2013 weighted. 6 hours to complete the exam; Breaks are permitted but restricted (you may be escorted for any bathroom visits). Exam clock is not paused during any breaks. Exam in a not open book. Computer-based testing is the most common standard. Pearson Vue is one of the most popular training centers offering test centers where candidates can sit the CISSP exam. Step Three \u2013 CISSP Study Materials One book is not enough! An array of resources is required. It is important to ensure that you use the most up to date books and resources to prepare. Recommended CISSP Exam Material: CISSP \u00ae Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide 7th Ed \u2013 By James Stewart, Mike Chapple, Darryl Gibson CISSP Study Guide Paperback by Eric Conrad Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP CBK, Fourth Edition (ISC2 Press) Hardcover by Adam Gordon A plethora of FREE resources available on the web Practice Exams (discussed further below). Step Four \u2013 Winning Strategy How to Study: Go through and study each chapter\u2019s domain individually until you get 80 \u2013 90% on the practice exams before you move on to the next domain. This will enable you to test your comprehension level of the material you have covered. Any areas which you are weak in you can then revise/retest before moving on to the next domain. The order, in which you study the domains, comes down to the individual\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in each of the CISSP domains. It is recommended to start with first domain \u2013 Security Governance through Principles and Policies. That way you will solidify the overarching principles (AIC!) and can then work through the remaining domains at your own discretion. Before the exam, take one to two weeks out to go through all of the domains inside out before you sit the exam. Remember This! 50% of your time should be spent studying CISSP materials 50% of your time should be spent on Practice Exams Plan! Set up a study schedule. This will depend on how quickly you decide to the CISSP exam. Anywhere from 2 months to 1 year of preparation depending on how quickly you would like to sit the exam and previous familiarity with the content. Step Five \u2013 The Exam! Timing: A 6-hour exam schedule is grueling. I will omit obvious recommendations to being well-rested and wearing appropriate attire, etc. You are given 6 hours to sit the exam. Sounds like a lot? When answering 250 questions in 6 hours. That gives you less than 1 and a half minutes per question. With this timing, you need a strategy in order to be able to answer questions within this time. Exam Strategy: Given the time constraints, you will need to have a strategy for your exam. As you need to get the best out of the time you have available. How you choose to tackle answering questions is at the discretion of the individual depending on the style that suits them best. A few suggestions are provided: Click through the entire test, to begin with You may want to quickly click through the entire exam questions, from start to finish before you start answering any questions. This will give you an overview of what to expect. Possibly even allow you to connect dots amongst questions, enabling you to answer with greater accuracy. Read the Questions Identify Keywords in questions \u2013 Best, least, not, first. Re-read if unclear Answering Questions: Answer what you know to be correct. Flag any you are not sure of and go back to these at the end of the exam. Questions you are unsure of the answer to \u2013 Go through and try to eliminate wrong answers first. Decide what it is that (ISC)2 is looking for. Keep an eye on the time!! You have less than 1 and a half minutes per question. Answer all of the questions \u2013 don\u2019t leave any blank.

            "answer_text": "Many resources are available to help the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) candidate prepare for the exam. Self-study is a major part of any study plan. Work experience is also critical to success, and you can incorporate it into your study plan. For those who learn best in a classroom or training environment, (ISC)2 offers CISSP review seminars. Commit to an intense 60-day study plan leading up to the CISSP exam. How intense? That depends on your own personal experience and learning ability, but plan on a minimum of two hours a day for 60 days. If you\u2019re a slow learner or reader, or perhaps find yourself weak in many areas, plan on four to six hours a day \u2014 and more on the weekends. But stick to the 60-day plan. If you feel you need 360 hours of study, you may be tempted to spread this study out over a six-month period for two hours a day. Consider, however, that committing to six months of intense study is much harder (on you, as well as your family and friends) than two months. In the end, you\u2019ll likely find yourself studying only as much as you would have in a 60-day period anyway. GETTING HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE Getting hands-on experience may be easier said than done, but keep your eyes and ears open for learning opportunities while you prepare for the CISSP exam. For example, if you\u2019re weak in networking or applications development, talk to the networking group or programmers in your company. They may be able to show you a few things that can help make sense of the volumes of information that you\u2019re trying to digest. ATTENDING AN (ISC)2 CISSP CBK REVIEW OR LIVE ONLINE SEMINAR The (ISC)2 also administers five-day CISSP CBK Review Seminars and Live OnLine seminars to help the CISSP candidate prepare. You can find information, schedules and registration forms for the CBK Review Seminar and Live OnLine on the (ISC)2 website. If you generally learn better in a classroom environment or find that you have knowledge or actual experience in only two or three of the domains, you might seriously consider attending a review seminar. If it\u2019s not convenient or practical for you to travel to a seminar, Live Online provides the benefit of learning from an (ISC)2 Authorized Instructor on your computer. Live OnLine provides all the features of classroom-based seminars, real-time delivery, access to archived modules, and all official courseware. ATTENDING OTHER TRAINING COURSES OR STUDY GROUPS Other reputable organizations offer high-quality training in both classroom and self-study formats. Before signing up and spending your money, we suggest that you talk to someone who has completed the course and can tell you about its quality. Usually, the quality of a classroom course depends on the instructor; for this reason, try to find out from others whether the proposed instructor is as helpful as he or she is reported to be. Many cities have self-study groups, usually run by CISSP volunteers. You may find a study group where you live; or, if you know some CISSPs in your area, you might ask them to help you organize a self-study group. ARE YOU READY FOR THE EXAM? Are you ready for the big day? Nobody can answer this question for you. You must decide, on the basis of your individual learning factors, study habits, and professional experience, when you\u2019re ready for the exam. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for determining your chances of success or failure on the CISSP examination. In general, a minimum of two months of focused study is recommended. Continue taking the practice exam on the Dummies website until you can consistently score 80 percent or better in all areas. CISSP For Dummies covers all the information you need to know if you want to pass the CISSP examination. Continue by reviewing other study materials (particularly in your weak areas) and actively participating in an online or local study group and take as many practice exams from as many different sources as possible. Then, when you feel like you\u2019re ready for the big day, find a romantic spot, take a knee, and \u2014 wait, wrong big day! Find a secure Wi-Fi hot spot (or other Internet connection), take a seat, and register for the exam! You can also join the SPOTO CLUB, they will help you pass CISSP exam. ",
