            "answer_text": "No. Twilight was not written with a young audience in mind, and it contains themes that are far from appropriate for children. I do not believe the presence of werewolves or vampires is an issue for kids, who might actually be delighted by scary stories, but Twilight depicts them as very sexual, and not really in a good way. I do not say this out of a belief that children should be raised without knowledge of sex, but really because these portrayals are borderline objectifying in many moments. Also, the sexually charged relationships described in the book are not of a healthy sort in general. Bella is a mostly helpless damsel in distress \u2014 not a very good example of a heroine to begin with \u2014 who is always in need of rescue by the gorgeous, overprotective men in her life. Edward in particular is not only physically dominant, but also mentally dominant, to the point that Bella becomes unable to live without him and goes into a catatonic state when they are separated. She completely puts her life on hold out of love \u2014 a dangerous notion too easily disguised as romantic. It can positively twist a child's understanding of what a relationship should be. One of the most glaring examples of abuse disguised as love, is during Bella's honeymoon, when after sex, she wakes up bruised and injured, and that does not really scare her. Instead, she feels sorry that the man she loved is in pain for having hurt her. Which, honestly, is just a beyond unhealthy view on domestic violence, a theme someone should be aware of before reading, in order to not be affected by these twisted depictions. Should a child of whatever age show interest to read this though, I recommend that a parent or other trustworthy adult reads it too, in order to enable the child to discuss the books under an appropriately critical view. That way, they may still enjoy the book while learning something positive from it \u2014 mainly, I think, to see through the romantic veils society often uses to excuse terrible actions. ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to alter the definition of \u201cchildren\u201d depending on the context I am using it in. For people who are teaching the term children is anyone who has yet to finish secondary school (so anyone under the age of 17, more or less). Sometimes I use children to refer to anyone who hasn\u2019t heard of something I think (or thought) was universally known and understood. (\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of the film \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d? Gods I\u2019m working with CHILDREN!!\u201d) But in this instance \u2014 when it comes to literature \u2014 I would refer to Twilight as YA Lit (\u201cYoung Adult Literature\u201d) and so say it is pitched, unsurprisingly, at young adults. Meaning somewhere around the 14 - 16 mark. Below that\u2026\u2026 if their parents think they can start reading it, then yes. Twilight starts of kind of dark (the scene in the Ballet studio is not for everyone) and stays about the same level of darkness \u2014 due the first person perspective a lot of the scenes in the films are not replicated in the books because Bella isn\u2019t present (the battle in the clearing for example) and having the story told through a calm, mostly dispassionate lens is kind of calming. However there are parts that are inescapably more suited to slightly older readers, and \u2014 as with all things \u2014 I think the parent is usually a good judge of what their offspring can handle. But since the book is classified as YAL then that\u2019s who it is pitched at. It is certainly not, for example, pitched at eight or nine year olds and definitely not pitched at six or seven year olds. And anyone who thinks it was written with that age group in mind REALLY needs to readjust their definition of \u201cYoung Adult\u201d ",
