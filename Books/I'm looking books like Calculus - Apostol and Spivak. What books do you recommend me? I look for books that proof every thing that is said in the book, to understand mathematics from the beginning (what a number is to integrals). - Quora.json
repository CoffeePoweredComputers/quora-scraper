            "answer_text": "I think, what you need is not one and only one book. My idea of learning analysis is: 1. You should understand what are minima-maxima tasks, what is the tangent (just an image), what is the connection between the slope of the tangent and the shape of the function. I think the definitions and the theorems do not help understand Mathematics. They are for the theory, not for the starting point of the learning. 2. When you are familiar with the concepts of calculus, you can start to read about why we should prove the statements, why we need the rigor definition. You can read on the foundation of Mathematics. 3. You can start to read and understand limit, continuity and the whole introductory analysis, sometimes we say it is the calculus. This method follows the way you learned geometry. First, you learned the useful and easily understandable facts, after that the theory of geometry, like what is the area (a function with 4 properties, when does it exist, and so on) and the statements. I hope, you started by the area of a rectangle and not by axioms of geometry. ",

It will certainly give you a good foundation for all you are asking about, and I do have proofs for 99% of what\u2019s in there. Then, for the next level, try the classic Kolmogorov and Fomin, Introductory Real Analysis.
