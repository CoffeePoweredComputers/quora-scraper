            "answer_text": "A letter of our 26 letter alphabet? Of course not. You can only copyright works you create yourself. You clearly didn\u2019t create the alphabet, so you can\u2019t copyright it. However, if you created an additional letter of the alphabet, for example, the letter \u2018gluck\u2019, which would be something on the lines of [\u0294], though you obviously wouldn\u2019t be able to use the IPA symbol for it. If you were to create the letter /gluck/, then you could prevent anyone else from using it without crediting you, and charge them a licence fee for doing so. The upshot of this would be\u2026 that no one ever used it. If it became necessary to have the letter for [\u0294], then people would stop using your version of it the moment you tried to enforce your copyright. They would either switch to the IPA letter [\u0294], or else they would use someone else\u2019s letter, released under the SIL licence. They might even ask SIL to design it or adjudicate it. Copyrighting /gluck/ would get you nothing. It would be a counter-productive copyright. However, if there was a universal need for /gluck/, and you created the letter that everyone agreed was the best, and you released it under the SIL licence, you could forever describe yourself as \u2018XYZ, creator of /gluck/\u2019. That would do you far more good than holding a barren copyright to a letter no one used. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I am not a lawyer. Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. A letter of the alphabet is an individual symbol. The alphabet is an ordered system. It's not a creative work by itself. It's a way in which creative, original works can be expressed. Even regarding entire fictional, constructed languages, the widespread opinion is that they can't be copyrighted, though that's still a grey legal area. Letter forms can't be copyrighted. Typeface designs can be copyrighted in most countries (not in the U.S.). Font files (digital implementations of typefaces) can be copyrighted. ",

            "answer_text": "The English language uses the Roman alphabet, as do German, Spanish and other Western languages. But no, symbols cannot be copyrighted. A symbol is not a \"creative work\". If you invented a new punctuation symbol, which still happens, you could protect the exact font you design for it, but not general renditions of the symbol. This is already happening with emoticons. You can copyright a specific smiley face, but not the idea or usage of a smiley face. ",
