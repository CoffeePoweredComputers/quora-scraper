            "answer_text": "You could\u2019ve explained a bit more about what you actually wanted to know. But anyway.. Books, as we see them now, weren\u2019t the same for the people in the prehistoric times. People used to inscribe on walls or carve out on rocks or woods or other materials, just to keep a record. Now, this takes us back to the time when inscribe-able characters were first introduced to humanity, by some really smart species of our kind. People then observed that they could express with those characters to someone who was unknown to them and that laid down the roots for the first phase of communication between us, the humans. Many years later when someone started to combine these characters and formed words, then phrases, then sentences, languages were born. Now, when people knew about a language, some of them tried to express themselves using it, like what we do even today. They started writing, but they weren\u2019t the first ones. Philosophers were then born. If you look out for \u201cthe world\u2019s oldest books\u201d on the internet right now, you can see a lot of books that just tell you something about the religions or believes. This gives us a vague idea about their lifestyle. Also, the earliest books which were introduced, were only found to be written on woods or leaves of the trees or even on the skin of dead animals. After all this, now that you know that books are so old that life before them would just have been fighting, hunting, cooking, farming, sending smoke signals, raising kids and protecting. For visualizing, here\u2019s a picture of the time period I\u2019m talking about (actually, even older than this as he looks a bit civilized).  Thank you for reading so far. Have a good day.[I don\u2019t have the world\u2019s best grammar, so pardon me]And please do comment in your views! Open to criticism :) ",
