            "answer_text": "Start with an interesting thing to do (plot), interesting people (character), or an interesting place to be (setting). Extrapolate from there. If you chose a setting, then who would be there? What will they need or want to do? If it\u2019s a plot, what kind of person will do it? Where will it be? And so forth. Eventually you will need to decide on a protagonist, regardless of your starting point. Figure out what they want, and what they fear. Whether it is the focal point of the plot or not, figure out how to get that character to face their ultimate fear. How they react is up to you, but we generally like to beat them because readers love to be lied to. Also offer that character the thing they wanted in the beginning. Again, how they react is up to you. However, if they accept it as they would have in the beginning, it probably means they don\u2019t have an arc. That\u2019s it! Most of the book is logically bringing characters from A to B. Have fun! ",
