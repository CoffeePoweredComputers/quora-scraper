            "answer_text": "If this is your first time, you must read an edition which contains only LITERAL TRNSLATION OF THE VERSES AND NOTHING ELSE. Why? Bhagavat Gita is a work of poetry. In an amazingly elegent textbook of philosophy which might predate eveen Socrates, Plato and Aristotole. It is a research work that compiles (almost) all the prevailing faith and belief system at that time leading towards a surprising turn towatrds monoetheism - a feature never seen in Hinduism and Halenic Greek. It says that there is only one god and if you are sincere, no matter wahatever path you choose. Thus, containaing all the features of poetry surprisingly so similar to mothern modern poetry. Nobody can explain a modern poem. Just like a modern painting, and poetry Gita is also a poem written to be feelt by the observer/reader and not to be explained to others. It is an experience that is the readers\u2019 very own, a private affair. Later, when you\u2019ll be able to enrich your mind with the interpretation, you can read the modern \u201cexplainations\u201d of Bhagavat Gita\u201d which are not so \u201cas it is\u201d (\u201cExplaination\u201d and \u201cas it is\u201d? seriously, dude? Kill me!!) ",
