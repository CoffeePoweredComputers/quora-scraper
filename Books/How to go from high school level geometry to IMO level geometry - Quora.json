            "answer_text": "Before I answer your question, I want to note that the IMO has geometry problems of vastly varying difficulty. The IMO problem shortlist gives you an idea of this with numerical categories for problems; geometry in particular goes from \u201cG1\u201d (easy) to \u201cG8\u201d (very hard), and the 1\u20138 scale is used for other topics as well. If you took high school geometry, you should know all the terms you need to understand what almost all IMO geometry problems are asking, because you should understand all the words like \u201ccollinear\u201d, \u201cbisector\u201d, \u201corthocenter\u201d, \u201cperpendicular\u201d, \u201cchord\u201d, \u201cdiameter\u201d, \u201ctangent\u201d, etc. However, to solve most of them you need to understand theory far beyond what you learn in high school. There are many good resources for contest math that go into the theory of Euclidean geometry, starting with perhaps the Art of Problem Solving books, and Geometry Revisited (which is quite comprehensive). Some important concepts just beyond high school geometry would be inscribed quadrilaterals/angle chasing around a circle, and basic triangle centers and other \u201cspecial points\u201d of triangles. The rabbit hole goes very, very deep though. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember staying home sick for a week or so as a kid and working my way through the first forty problems or so of Prasolov\u2019s \u201cProblems in plane geometry\u201d (in Russian). I believe that this book and its 3d sequel got translated into English, but I don\u2019t know how good the translation is. It really did make me much more comfortable with olympiad geometry problems. There are a couple of comments I want to make. The IMO geometry problems have gotten a touch harder over the years, essentially in an attempt to make them hard to solve by brute force calculations (still it is often trivial to do so if one can use a computer to do symbolic manipulations). So if you want to get to these more recent problems, I suggest starting with Prasolov\u2019s or similar book and then work on early IMO problems. Last but not least, geometry problems are a fairly useless part of IMO. The specific knowledge and tricks used there tend to be of little relevance to \u201creal mathematics\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, these problems can generally be solved by brute force. I understand the appeal of these problems to some extent, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend focusing on them too much. ",
