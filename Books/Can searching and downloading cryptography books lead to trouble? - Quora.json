            "answer_text": "Crypto is math. Can you get into trouble for stealing a math book? Yes. Are you allowed to read math books? Usually, also yes. If you legally download a math book can that lead to trouble? Maybe. If you attempt to pass the authors expression of the ideas off as your own, you could be plagiarising or possibly violating copyright. If you downloaded the book to show you how to break crypto, you will be disappointed. One of the main reasons that crypto algorithms are published, is that knowing the method by which the crypto works does not allow you to break it. That\u2019s the way that the math works. Can you use the examples of working crypto in the book to devise your own crypto algorithms? Possibly. But if you need to keep the method secret in order to make the crypto work, then it is not done.
