            "answer_text": "The evil CEO from Avatar: Parker Selfridge. Yeah, I know, evil corporation exploiting and slaughtering natives for mere profit while ignoring the good pure scientists. How could this guy be good? But wait, there's more! Keep in the back of your mind that there are billions of humans on Earth, while there are probably only a few million Na'vi on \u201cPandora\". This isn't our main argument, because that would be wrong, but just keep it in mind. We'll assume that this is a 1000-1 ratio. Ok, back to the evil CEO. Remember in the beginning of the movie that our good, wonderful scientist, Sigourney Weaver, yells at Parker Selfridge for giving her a Marine instead of a scientist. Keep in mind the very expensive genetically engineered avatar that can only synchronize with genetically compatible people has already been made. Parker can't just put anyone in it. The money's been spent. Getting her a scientist will cost tens of millions more and importantly, will take years of training and cloning. He may have already ordered it, but it will take years to arrive. Now here's where it gets interesting. Selfridge reminds Sigourney that it's her job to find a diplomatic solution. That's what pays for her research. In other words, Sigourney's whole purpose on Pandora is to talk to the natives and find a way to avoid violence. She spends the rest of the movie taking plant cuttings and looking at microscopes of biology samples. Later, Selfridge tells Jake Sully he needs to find a carrot, something positive to give the Na'vi to get them to move. Otherwise they're going to forceably move them. Sully spends the rest of the movie finding military weaknesses. It was the job of Sigourney and Jake to peacefully end the conflict. They failed to give him any peaceful options. They didn't even protest against violent removal of the natives. They never said \u201cGee, killing people for money is wrong\". Jake sully spent the entire movie saying \u201cYeah, let's kill these blue cat people\u201d before deciding to lead the resistance. Sigourney ignored her job and let hundreds die. Jake turned over the most vital secrets of the Na'vi - he betrayed both sides and it is directly his fault that the conflict resulted in so much death. \u201cNo thankful. No good here. Only sad. Very sad. They didn't have to die.\u201d Next, let's look at the Na'vi. They're xenophobic racists. Neytiri's first action on seeing Jake Sully get attacked and separated from his friends is to try and kill him. She doesn't apologize or pray to his spirit like she does for the animals that attack him. Apparently human spirits don't deserve respect because the Na'vi never apologize for killing exploitative humans like they do for the wild animals that eat other people. We don't know who started the fighting. We assume it was the humans because, hey, big evil corporations. Even though the only person who ever explicitly tries to attempt a peaceful solution is the evil CEO Parker Selfridge. The Na'vi's only response seems to be to take pot shots at dump truck drivers while demanding to be left alone. They're not wrong, sort of. As long as they claim possession of the land for only their race, and the minerals in it, then there's no problem defending their property. It's only problematic if the Na'vi believe \u201cno one owns the land\". If that's the Na'vi philosophy then they're simply murdering humans for being human and digging up rocks (which nobody else is using). What I'm getting at here is that if someone lands in my backyard and begins strip mining it, I'd pull out the poison arrows and start shooting too. But if someone lands in the street and asks \u201chey bro, can I park here\" and I say \u201csure bro, it's a public street\", then I started savagely beating them then I'm clearly in the wrong. I want to make clear here, I'm not suggesting that the Na'vi are wrong to defend their land. I'm suggesting that they're wrong because they're hypocritically defending their ownership of land they claim is not theirs. We also want to ask, would the Na'vi kill other Na'vi who strip mined random parts of the wilderness? Or is it only humans? It's a little unsettling that Avatar is supposed to be a parable about racism, but the \u201cgood\u201d side is as racist, or possibly more racist than the \u201cbad guys\". The bad guys are just there to make a buck. The \u201cgood guys\" are there to stop \u201caliens\" from benefitting from \u201cNa'vi only\" resources, even if the Na'vi aren't using those resources. There is no point in the movie where \u201cunobtanium\" is shown as a resource the Na'vi use. The only real conflict is that the Na'vi hate and look down on other cultures, while the evil corporation wants them to move so it can access the minerals. The movie shows no link between the planet's living tree and the mineral. Clearly if the unobtanium was the battery for their life-tree then there'd be a big issue. But as far as the movie ever explains, the humans are just digging up rocks which have no influence on the Na'vi and their way of life. Again, I want to emphasize that I don't agree with the evil corporation. They clearly have no business killing people to steal their village. They have no business killing the life-tree. The humans in this movie are not good people. But the Na'vi are xenophobic murderers who appear to be hypocritically killing people over worthless rocks simply because \u201chumans shouldn't have rocks\". And this is odd, because the moral of the movie Avatar appears to be \u201cit's wrong for racists to kill people over mere material stuff\u201d. The humans \u201cexploit nature\u201d by digging up rocks and flying machines. The Na'vi live in harmony with nature by mind-controlling innocent animals. They use their hair-brain-tentacles to force their thoughts into the animal's minds. Some animals fight this to the death, but are so mentally traumatized by it that they'll only serve one person for the rest of their lives as a personal slave/pet. Humans don't even have circus animals anymore. Let's get back to Parker Selfridge. Planning to forceably move the Na'vi is wrong. It's a line he shouldn't have crossed, but did. He is wrong. He is evil. But\u2026 he is trying to mine rocks the Na'vi don't want. He's offered them payment. He's offered them education, healthcare, infrastructure. He's invested millions of dollars and years of time into developing the Avatars expressly for the purpose of dealing equitably with the Na'vi (apparently the Na'vi won't talk to anyone who doesn't look like they do). He's asked his scientists to find a diplomatic solution (which they ignored to spend their time to cut up samples off of the sacred life tree). He's asked his scientists to find something, anything, he can give them that they would want. He gives them months, years even, to solve the problem. The Na'vi simply won't deal with humans. They have nothing to learn from humans, yet they have the arrogance to tell human scientists \u201cit's hard to fill a full cup\", while the Na'vi apparently don't accept things like arithmetic and bandaids. All Parker Selfridge is doing is harvesting a desperately necessary material for his home planet in hopes of being rewarded for saving his world. If someone can save Earth, should they really have to die in poverty? It's not that Selfridge is a good person, but of all the factions in Avatar, he has done the most to assure peace. He is using violence, but he's the only one using it as a last resort. Everyone else accepts violence as the first solution, yet they're hailed as peaceful pacifists and Selfridge is the warmonger. His is efforts are being sabotaged and ignored by the people he's paying to solve the problem. All he's really asking Sigourney Weaver is that since she's being paid to find a diplomatic solution, and since the only way they can afford to continue to travel to \u201cPandora\" for study is a solution, that maybe she should find one in tandem with her biology studies. And he really likes golf - the true mark of an evil mastermind. And let's get to the real villain in the movie. Not just mistaken. Not just wrong. Not even merely evil. We're talking about wicked. Cruel. Sadisticly wicked. Did anyone else notice that it's relatively easy for humans to clone Avatars and splice human DNA into them? Find it odd that on a planet animals and even plants would naturally evolve to be mentally compatible to the extent that they'd basically have USB cables sticking out of their heads? And positioned conveniently enough for riders to plug into? The mind protocol goes one-way, so that horses and pterodactyls obey commands like good little machines, but the pilots don't start eating grass or preening their feathers. That Na'vi culture seems to be built around acceptance that \u201cat some point you die and upload your thoughts to this tree\u201d? The obvious fact is that the biology of \u201cPandora\" is engineered. And it's all in service to one living thing. Even the big bear-tiger obeys commands, eager to eat the Na'vi for breakfast, mindlessly defending them when they're fighting for the survival of the one living thing on \u201cPandora\" around which all life revolves. The one thing to which the Na'vi upload their conciousness (or is it just their memories). Is the tree of life really a biologically-powered internet that hosts an afterlife paradise for the Na'vi? Or is it a global overlord that manipulates their beliefs, mimics their dead relatives\u2019 memories in order to con future generations into uploading their minds? A mastermind that keeps the Na'vi living in primitive squalor, feeding it's own vast appetites, using the Na'vi just as the Na'vi use the horses? \u2026And now I've spoiled Avatar for everyone. Next week: Bambi - arson or terrorist? ",

            "answer_text": "Clyde Alexander Shelton in Law abiding citizen (2009 movie)  In the movie, Clyde (played by Gerard Butler from 300 Spartans) is a retired weapon developer for military black ops. One day while he, his wife and their daughter were home, two ruthless criminals Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames broke into the house. Darby stabbed Clyde and his wife with a knife then raped her right in front of him. The little daughter was carried to the next room for the supposedly similar brutal treatment. Miraculously, Clyde survived the ordeal. The two criminals were soon caught. However, prosecutor Nick Rice (the protagonist of the film) was forced to make a deal with Darby since the evidence is not enough to make a full conviction against Darby and Nick doesn't want to risk lowering his 99% conviction rate if he loses. And so the chief culprit, more guilty criminal Darby was let off with only a few years of prison time while Ames got a death sentence. When Clyde protested \u201cBoth of them are guilty, especially Darby, you know that\u201d, Nick responded \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s what you can prove in court\u201d, \u201cSome justice is better than no justice at all\u201d. Feeling betrayed by the prosecutor and the entire justice system, Clyde decided to take matters into his own hand to avenge bitter grievances. His first victims were, of course, the two convicted criminals. Their deaths were something out of a horror movie. Clyde was soon tracked down and arrested but his revenge plot had just begun. Even in solitary cell, he still managed to slaughter cops, prosecutors, defense attorney, judge in an attempt to cleanse the entire justice system's corruption and get rid of the people responsible for Darby's unfair sentence time. What Clyde did was certainly not right or legal, but obviously he had a point and many have to sympathize with him as he said in one of the interrogations after his arrest: Nick: We're done here. We have your confession. On tape. See, in our profession, we consider that a slam-dunk. Clyde: Oh, really? I don't think so. Let's think back. What did I say? That I wanted to kill Clarence Darby? Yeah, sure. What father wouldn't? That both Darby and Ames deserved to die? I think most people would agree with that. That I planned it over and over again in my head? Yeah. Who wouldn't fantasize about that? None of these are an admission of guilt, Nick. You might want to check the tape. Nick: We know you did it. Clyde: Well, it's not what you know, it's what you can prove in court. Didn't you tell me that once?  ",
