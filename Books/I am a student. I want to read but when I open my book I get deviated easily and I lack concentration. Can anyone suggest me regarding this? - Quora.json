            "answer_text": "A lot of students find themselves in such a situation. I have also come across such a situation a number of times in my student life. To tackle this, I used to set very small goals. Instead of making up my mind to study for an hour or two and finish the entire unit. I would take up a small section. If the section seemed big too. I would break it down more according to my comfort. Always remember this that study cannot be measured in time. For some individuals just 15\u201320 minutes might be enough. But some of might struggle with such a short time. So don\u2019t measure it in time. Measure the matter covered and go about it in small steps. Also, since now you are going to take small steps. You need to start early. Do not wait too long to start. The earlier you start, the better it is for you. Another thing I did was keeping a copy of the syllabus and I would strike off the topic I finished with my pen. This made me track my progress as well as gave me some encouragement as it made me feel like I conquered another topic. Whenever you find yourself in a situation where you find yourself easily deviated, bored, lacking concentration. Just change the way you have been studying. Make a new strategy and work in a different manner than usual. I hope this will help you! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. I'm sure many of us have gone through this :D But when I want to concentrate on my book rather than the walls, I do something like this - I keep my phone away locked in my wardrobe.I pick a good place which is bright enough, like near the window, or under the study lamp.Now when I start, I read to myself as if I'm the teacher and there is some student in front of me, and I need to explain till the student understands every bit.I use a book and a pen to jot down the important points to remember. Trust me this works, and I end up sitting calmly in one place for 2 hours with full concentration, and satisfaction. If at all you end up wasting your time with a book in your hand, remind yourself this - Do the necessary first, then do the possible. And slowly you'll realize you're doing the impossible. :) Good luck!",
