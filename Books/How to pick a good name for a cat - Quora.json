            "answer_text": "The great answer for your question would be don't choose/pick name, create a name. My cat was white and had a greyish\u2014black spot on her head. Since it would not be right to call her blackhead cause those are bumps which get removed from human's face. I named her Greyhead. I had named my another yellow cat \ud83d\udc08'snowflake'. ",

            "answer_text": "I let the cat help me pick it's name. I call them by several different names until they seem to respond more to one. Some names they seem to respond with more interest. The only exception is when they have come from a rescue in which case if they know and respond to a particular name I keep it. I hope this helps. ",
