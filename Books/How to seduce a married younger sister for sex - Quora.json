I suggest you don\u2019t do that for a moral reason, as cheating is intolerable.. But if you really need it, I will give you some tips.

It worked with me before, when I fucked my cousin. There is a good chance this will not work for you, because of the fact SHE IS MARRIED, and it will get you slapped unless she is a whorey bitch. In my case I never cheated on anyone, I fucked my cousin who was a virgin and was willing to accept me. ",

Humans have the unique ability to contemplate the consequences of their actions. But of course I'm committing the classic folly of advising. Taking a situation out of its context and in so doing changed it. Nobody can advise another person BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THAT PERSON! We do it constantly, by some strange aberration of our brain acting in the belief that we know better than another person what that person should do. The person knows already how to seduce.
