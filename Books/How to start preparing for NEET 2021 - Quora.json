Cramming up the concepts seems like an easy way through a vast syllabus such as one for NEET 2020, therefore instead going through the basics, aspirants resort to rot learning. This memorization technique might sound useful but it is not fruitful in the long run. It is essential to go through the basic concepts and have clarity of crucial topics in order to build a strong foundation on which the entire syllabus rests upon. If the basics are strong, the whole syllabus can be memorised easily. If the syllabus is completed through rot learning, there is a higher probability of forgetting it at the hour of examination. It is advisable to have a better understanding of the syllabus and basic concept in order to retain it for a longer time. 3) Clearing Doubts It goes without saying that there will be numerous doubts that will need clarification while studying for NEET.
