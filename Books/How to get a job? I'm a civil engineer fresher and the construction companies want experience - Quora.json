            "answer_text": "Okkk so you are done with your engineering , Many Many congratulations on that part :) Now , yaa it is true that its quite difficult to get a job in a construction company as a fresher without having any contact/approach in the company who can refer you. Besides there is no point in working for small builders/Construction Company as it wont build your profile neither experience wise nor salary wise . Construction and Real Estate Industry are facing a slow down since past some years, so there is no job security as well in small construction companies so don\u2019t go for it unless it is the only option left. What I would suggest you is to look for internships at Good Companies / PSU\u2019s ( If Possible ). Its easier to get Internships ( Try your best for Paid One ) than a permanent job. Benefits of doing Internship :- It is anytime better than sitting idle and doing nothing. Atleast you will learn something and get an experience certificate which will surely help you more than your CGPA during interviews.Being an intern , company will not put you under pressure of targets and work. You are there only for learning. Company does not expect anything else from you.If you are lucky enough and your reporting senior is a good person , you might end up getting your internship changed to permanent job.Along with your internship , you can do some extra things which will add up to your resume as well as open some other career options :- Learn Civil Softwares like Autocad , StaddPro , Revit Architecture , E Tab. Learning these sofwares only might land you up for a decent design job at some firm.Start Your preparation for GATE/IES. If you are looking for long term benefits , job security then this is the best option to work on. Start your preparation now , go slowly but prepare on daily basis. You will surely end up with good result. Refer my below answers on GATE 2018 & 2019 Preparation strategy.Paras Bhatia's answer to How do I crack the GATE 2018 if I start today?Paras Bhatia's answer to How can one prepare for the GATE 2019 by self-studying?Don\u2019t worry its just the starting , there is still a long way to go. Just keep trying and never loose hope :) Something good is waiting for you at the end :) If you have any other doubt , do write in comments or message me on QUORA. I will be happy to help :) I am a blogger @FuturePal || Do visit and tell me your reviews. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Make sure your resume looks good enough that the companies don't want to lose you. I'll tell you one thing. Companies can have tax benefits if they hire freshers and give them training for 1 year. So, companies visit engineering colleges and recruit freshers even though they have required number of engineers with them. If you are from India, you can follow these to make your resume look good. 1. Maintain decent GPA 7 + (Marks cannot quantify your knowledge but this will be a key factor during your resume shortlisting.)  2. Learn AutoCAD, Staad pro. (Learn them well) . Revit/ETABS are optional  3. ENHANCE YOUR KNOWLEDGE (Through ASCE Journals, nptel videos and many other useful videos related to civil engineering on YouTube etc)  4. Participate in Paper presentations and Workshops (Preferably IIT's and NIT's). Attend their technical fests. You get to learn a lot. (Try to get a merit certificate there). Believe me it's not that tough. 5. Select a good topic for final year project. Try something new. (Avoid traditional concrete testing projects if possible). 6. Internships : I agree it is during summer holidays after 2nd /3rd year but make sure you learn something during that time as well. As a civil engineer, you need to know how things work at site. Internship is a golden opportunity to know that.  7. You can do some certification courses while you are in engineering itself. Believe me, they are very useful. (Eg: LEED Certification) 8. Try being associated with Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) andInstitution of Engineers (India) IEI. 9. Along with studies, you need to take part in extracurricular activities like NCC,NSS etc.  In addition to all the above, build your communication skills. That's it. You will be better than other civil engineers of your class. You don't need to work for free. You are entitled to get paid for the work you do for the company.  Now let us come to the career options or higher studies after engineering. (In India) You have many options once you complete civil engineering in India(I don't know much about the opportunities abroad) which can place you in a better position. 1. GATE : You can give it a try. (If you are so desperate to do M.Tech in some of the reputed institutions ) M.Tech in Transportation Engineering M.Tech in Structural Engineering M.Tech in Water Resource Engineering M.Tech in Geo-Technical engineering M.Tech in Environmental Engineering etc 2. IES : Indian Engineering Services. Believe me. You are now eligible to apply. (EVEN CIVIL SERVICES) 3. PSU : If you are technically strong, you can apply for PSU's. Nowadays they are mainly dependent on GATE score. So, prepare hard for GATE. Give your best shot. Some Government departments like Department of Atomic energy etc conduct their own exams for recruitment. Follow their advertisements. 4. State Government Jobs : Comparatively easy to crack (You know how tough it is to crack IES ?) You are even eligible for Bank Jobs in India. (Bank PO's) 5. Jobs @ Construction giants like L & T, Tata Projects, SPCL, HCC etc. : Attend their interviews. Go to their respective websites, search for CAREERS option, speak to HR persons or mail them your resume. If luck favours you, you might get a call for attending their interviews. 6. Higher studies : MBA or Construction /Project management etc in India - You can as well attempt CAT with your engineering degree. If you are fortunate enough, you may get into some IIM. If you wish to shift to management after Civil engineering, You can as well give a thought on Construction Management/Project Management programmes offered all over India. You get a white collar job with a decent pay after completion of these programmes. Some colleges are listed below where you can pursue Construction/Project Management. Construction Technology and Management course -IIT Delhi and IIT- Madras Construction Technology and Management course -IIT Delhi gives more weight on Technical Aspects of Construction. National Institute of Construction Management and Research Programmes offered from Pune, Hyderabad, Goa and Indore. Visit their website for more details. NICMAR gives more weight on Managerial aspects of Construction. (Costliest option of all :D ) Page on nicmar.ac.in Been there: Kasee Sreenivas's answer to How is life at NICMAR Pune? RICS School of Built Environment, Amity University (UGC Approved) Set up in early 2013 as an industry led initiative, it is supported by leading employers & Ministry of Urban Development. It offers several programmes like: MBA in Real Estate and Urban Infrastructure, MBA in Construction Project Management, MBA in Construction Economics & Quantity Surveying, MBA in Infrastructure Management etc Global Institute of Construction Management and Research This institute provides Post Graduate Diploma in some courses (AICTE approved) For more details, visit GICMAR (Global Institute of Construction Management and Research) Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune This institute provides Post Graduation Diploma in Project & Construction Management. All are equally good from career point of view. Some institutes offer Computer aided programmes for civil engineers. Civil engineers and architects are eligible for this course. There are some more reputed institutions which offer similar courses. 7. Higher studies abroad : GRE, TOEFL, IELTS whatever. 8. If you are interested in City planning or town planning, there is an institute in Delhi (School of Planning and Architecture) which offers a post graduation degree in various disciplines. Even this is a good option. Let me tell you this. Don't worry even if you don't get any of the above, You can still do some certification courses on different courses available online or through distance education. Believe me, you can enhance your knowledge. Enlist all the certification courses/ distance education courses you have done in your CV. (Something is better than nothing) You have many other options. I just enlisted what all came to my mind. FEEL PROUD. YOU ARE A CIVIL ENGINEER. All the very best :)  Follow this for more: Opportunities for Civil Engineers in India Images Source: [1]\u200b ",

            "answer_text": "Ashwini   I feel for your concern about the annoying situation about the fresh civil Engineering graduates. Companies are hesitant to hire Fresh graduates. Yes! Until we give training you will not get experience and work. But the other side is ( As a person who Trains fresh civil Engineering students in my FINISHING school and also a Ex corporate who has hired these civil Engineer for My company ) today time is the only way a company make money .Do projects within time and get more rewards so they relay have less time and resources to train and get work done. They Intended to give more salaries to the existing employees and get work done than hiring a fresher.  Automation like SW for designs ... etc has reduced the dependency on work force ( where freshers are taken ) But with all said and done they do Hire Fresh to get a Bankable pool of people for future ..You have to show your hunger for learning. UNlike in SW industry where the bench strength is the showcase of the strength to get projects here in civil Engineering contracts it is machines and equipment to get their projects. Thats the reason many of them do not take FRESH CIVIL ENGINEERS    NOW HOW TO BEAT THE BLUE !   We do help the Fresh students to get placed HOW ?? Please message me   ",

Having worked even a few weeks or months makes it easier for companies to gauge the capability of actually performing tasks and social skills versus someone who has only been in class room setting. Even working in completely unrelated field can showcase abilities it's how information is presented sometimes. So if you can't get experience directly in your field get it in a similar field. Offer to work for free for a few weeks so you can gain experience. For the most part if a company is looking for fresh graduates then they wouldn't be expecting much more then that. If they are only advertising positions that require years of experience then it's time to look at some place different. ",

            "answer_text": "well there are related things you can do when you have no engineering experience but get exposure to civil engineering. For eample, if you had gotten a summer job working for a civil engineering firm while in high school or early college, many companies open summer jobs for sons and daughters of employees and or customers or even for kids off the street. Admittedly you have to look hard and find these or be lucky, or both. It will not have given you engineering experience but would have given you some exposure to people and the industry. Even if you are an office boy or a librarian for the summer. Such exposure demonstrated an active interest in the profession which gives you one leg up over an equally qualified student with no exposure. ",

Within one week he had seven offers for internships - one of which has turned into a paid internship - which then turned into an actual solid job offer.  The point is there is always a way, to get the work experience that you need. ",

What ever the company it may be small or big go to interviews then definitely you will get chance in any one company. After then you learn work And gain experience ,after that you can know which is the good way and how can you proceed your next step.no matter definitely they are asking experience for graduate fresher's but some companies are providing chances.  Don't get scared after seeing this,this is what the trend.  All the best.. ",

Get to know work and its atmosphere by joining local construction company or private contractors.  1st disadvantage- they won't pay u well. 2nd they will make u work for tons of hours.  If you survive this for 2 odd years,  you can earn a ton on your own by running your own construction company.  Don't underestimate any work or job given to you. Then only you can learn a lot.

The work was a lot and the pay was very less, as he was a fresher...so I think you should apply to the govt. jobs. They will surely take freshers and the pay is always good. And once you have gained your experience, you will be promoted and your pay will be very handsome indeed!...wish you all the very best!! ",
