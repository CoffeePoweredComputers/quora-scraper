            "answer_text": "As the presents aren't for me, then I wouldn't send them back, but that's me, you might feel very differently. I found the best way to deal with the obnoxious MIL was to answer the surface question, not the underlying criticism. When asked for an opinion, I turned the question back, \u2018I'm sure you know better than me, what do you think?\u2019 When asked if I was wearing that outfit out I'd tell her I had a change of clothes with me \u2014 so not giving a direct answer. When she was totally out of order I'd say \u2018dear Pure, always so kind' or a wide-eyed \u2018really?\u2019 in an amazed voice. As you can imagine these come backs took time to come up with, but they worked. I rarely got angry as that was playing into her hands. By the end, I was an expert at deflecting, removing the importance, and cutting her off without causing any kind of upset. Sad, isn't it, that it was so necessary for my well being. What I didn't do was bad mouth her to her grandchildren, if they repeated a comment to me I'd often respond with hm, that's a bit hard, how could we say it better, which deflected from the question/comment. Or gosh, really, another wide eyed look and left it there, immediately changing the subject. Anyway, that's how I dealt with her. ",

            "answer_text": "No i wouldn\u2019t send them back, i would be courteous and kind always! Don\u2019t sink down to her level, she could be testing your metal! What i would do it this: -Get the children to write thank you cards and post them off to her. EVERY TIME she sends them anything. -Ask her opinion on something, listen quietly when she tells you no matter what you think. -Tell her after you tried something her way (and it worked) that it worked and you are grateful. -Phone her regularly and say Hi \u201cPat\u201d, \u201cJack\u201d wants to say hello then hand her over to her grandchild who will tell her about his day at school. Grandmas hate to feel obsolete, unwanted and not loved so whether or not you like or love or hate her YOUR children have the rights to have a friendship with her so let them, and help her and them have one. She WILL come around to you despite herself! Lastly do not take what she does to you personally it is not about you. The fault is all hers. So help her get out of the funk she has gotten herself into. Your husband will love you all the more for it and so will the rest of the family. ",
