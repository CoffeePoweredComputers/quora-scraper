Which was and is very much enough to get a good score . What is majorly important is how clear you know the concepts !! And I do agree according to my point of view that R D Sharma is a very huge book and certainly not that very important to score 95 + If u refer to the previous year papers and oswaal Question Bank along with Ncert examples and problems You definitely could!!! All the best ",

            "answer_text": "I'll tell you a true story, I never ever touched RD Sharma not RW Aggarwal. All I solved was NCERT (class 10th maths bhagavat gita)., sample papers, previous years question (oswaal) and school revision. During 10th mid term exam, the math question paper set by my school teachers was quite tough according to my other fellow classmates ( those who brag by telling they solved RD Sharma). Then one of my friend told me that most of the questions were from RD Sharma. Mid term results were outand I topped my class by getting 79.5 out of 80. And in boards I got 75 out of 80 ( lost in trigonometry) So the moral of the story is Solve NCERT, sample paper questions, previous years papers again and again and again aagain\u00d710000000 All the best for your exams :) ",

And you should have done a variety of problems of various difficulty levels.Now R D Sharma is a Bible for 10th students but if you have confidence that you have done ncert very well and you can solve previous year papers then you should be confident. for exam. I will not suggest to start a new book at last few days so better to revise whatever you have done NCERT textbook+previous year papersDon't make a specific Target but do your. BestBest of All",
