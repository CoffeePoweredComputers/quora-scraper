            "answer_text": "Not unless the publisher has set up a scheme for that. Some have, now and again - I bought a Yotam Ottolenghi cookbook a while back that has a code printed in the back with which I can access, well, it\u2019s not an ebook but an online version of the book. Recently I\u2019ve seen other schemes for epub downloads along these lines. But it isn\u2019t terribly prevalent. In a lot of jurisdictions it would be legal for you to prepare your own ebook copy using the physical book - you could transcribe it or scan it and fix the scan errors. But that\u2019s clearly a lot of work. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can go through a fairly involved conversion process, as described by Doris Booth, or you can purchase the ebook, often for a reduced price, on Amazon and certain other retailers. The catch, of course, is that you have to have purchased the physical book from Amazon as well to qualify for the reduced price. But many publishers instruct Amazon to take more than 50% off the price of the ebook if you\u2019ve already purchased the physical book. It is, unfortunately, not possible to get a free ebook version of a physical copy that you own through current online book retailers. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure! You just need a PDF file of your book, so that you can submit it to the ebook publishing company in ebook format. Remember, an ebook can be published in color and in different fonts depending on the rules of the publishing company involved. Print books are expensive in color, but an ebook can be published with illustrations, fonts etc. fully in color. If you mean can you buy an ebook copy of a physical book, only if you can get the PDF and the rights to publish it, or if there is a published ebook version of the print book. You have to look it up, to see if there is one. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes you can. You will need to covert the printed text to an an ePub format. The best way to do this is to hire a professional conversion service but you can also create your own PDF file, establish a publishing account with various sales channels and then upload the file. If there is no existing digital file you may need to tear the book apart , scan the pages into an electronic format and then carefully edit to correct any errors in the transfer process.
