            "answer_text": "For a long time I thought of integrity as something that was externally validated. I thought this because the only time I heard about integrity was when someone was passing judgement on someone else's level of integrity. \"Jonathan has a lot of integrity.\"  I now think of integrity as something we develop internally, on a continuum of more or less, that may or may not be recognized by those around us. We develop integrity by aligning our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Carl Rogers called this \"congruence.\" We lose integrity when one of those three is out of alignment with the other two. For example, if we do something [action] that betrays how we feel or what we think, we lose integrity [to a greater or lesser extent]. Even if our subjective experience is that our misaligned action damaged our integrity, others might not see it that way.  As a social worker I might find myself in a situation where I cannot be sure that a person will be safe from suicide risk in the community. My action is to recommend hospitalization. This action might challenge my integrity about honoring self-determination and the dignity and worth of the person. I might genuinely belive that the hospitalization will present the person with more challenges to his/her well-being than being at home. But I might be tired from a 10-hour day and know that setting up the safety plan will mean that I don't get home for another three hours. I also might know that the on-call psychiatrist will never support my recommendation for discharge to the community. Therefore I lose a bit of integrity when I tell the person, \"it is my professional opinion that you will not be safe at home and therefore I am recommending hospitalization.\" My actions betray my thoughts about hospitalization and my feelings of discomfort when I think about this person in the hospital. The reason why the subjective experience is so important in establishing integrity is that the people around me might not see my actions as lacking integrity. \"Well done, Jonathan,\" they might say. \"You just saved a person's life.\" They would see me acting with integrity.  Making a personal commitment and sticking to that commitment is the best way to restore your integrity. With the above example, I might make a commitment (promise) to myself that I will NOT recommend hospitalization until I truly believe that there is no reasonable alternative, and that I feel more comfortable with hospitalization than I do with recommending discharge to the community. This commitment might mean that I have to also commit to staying late, challenging the psychiatrist, etc. So, you can see that the process of developing and maintaining integrity is never ending. ",
