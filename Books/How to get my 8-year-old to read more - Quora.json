It may take time but the way you proceed with your own children may have a lot of reason that the child won\u2019t even do what they need to do. Do you remember when you were 8 years old and how it was? Kids are like yourself when you were a child. You may use good strategies to help your kids to learn well. However, I would talk to my kids about the benefits out of learning about many things in life and the shooling is one of remedy to develop how to learn, study, and be ready for their future life. I truly believe in every parent to get to know your own children what they are thinking and feeling about everything in life. It is an important part of being a parent. Many parents think they know their own children but not. IT is the downfall that when kids grow up to be a teenager, they too, think they know everything but not. This is the reason I emphasize \u201cEducation Starts at Home.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Try to center the reading around their personal interests: For example if he/she likes animals, get both fictional and non-fiction books about animals at their reading level (you can ask a librarian for help if needed with that), and play up the titles, pictures, and maybe read the first page, to wet their appetite. If he or she likes an animated Disney character, get books related to that movie or cartoon. It is also a proven fact that if you read expressively and dramatically to children on a regular basis, they will be more likely to enjoy reading themselves. Another idea is to make reading fun and practical - read cereal boxes, children\u2019s magazines, billboards, and any text that is within sight of the child. Label things in the house such as table, chairs, toys, cabinet, desk, bed, etc., and have the child read the labels. One thing that worked for me as a reading tutor, is that I explained to my student that they would be able to succeed in life more if they learned to read more. (Specifically, I told him he could learn more about video games by reading the secret manuals giving secret codes and help to winning the video game, so if your child is interested in sports, you could say that they could learn more about their sport of choice if they knew how to read, and could improve their game ; ) ",

For an eight year old, you want to put reading as an option that has a lot of different things. Whether that eight year old will like it is different. I suggest you do some research on any books that they would like. Reading to them would also help. Stories are enjoyed by everyone and more exposure to it will endear them to it. ",

Coloring in a box when he/she has finished a book. Or even helping him/her read at night by reading one page, then having your child read the other one. And you switch back and forth.

If that does not work you can try asking them what they really like and what interest them. Then you want to find a book that is most related t what they like. For my little brother he really likes marine animals so I gave him a book series called Who Would Win which is about all kinds of animals fighting and who would win. I hope this helps! - Isa ",
