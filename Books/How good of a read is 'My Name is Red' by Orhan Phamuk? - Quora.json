            "answer_text": "Profoundly exuberant, this book is a piece of art in itself. It is deeply rich in history and culture and gives deep insight into the art of painting during the Ottoman reign in the 16th century Istanbul. There are extremely minute and comprehensive details about the designs, colors, brushes, drawing styles as well as the jealousy and love among the painters, gilders, miniaturists and masters in the painting workshops that one feels like being a part of that era while reading this book. The author has taken the reader throughout the book in a unique style where each and every character and the objects, pictures and even colors communicate directly in first person to the reader and fascinate with their story and explain the context in their own point of view. There are in-depth details and stories within stories which will take the reader to a further deeper level in this colorfully rich tapestry and in parallel to this, there is a love story, and a murder mystery which is to be solved by the reader himself as every object and character gives a clue to complete the missing piece of the puzzle. It was fascinating to read about an empire which was once the most powerful and was slowly coming to its decline. The unwritten dogma of blindness among master miniaturists was unknown to me until I have read this book and is really strange to know that natural blindness among them was perceived as an honour or even a gift of God, some miniaturists went too far to protect their style that they purposely either blinded themselves or pretended to be blind for the rest of their lives. I didn\u2019t know that homosexuality was common among Muslims of that time, if in any case, it is true, especially using young boys for carnal desires is very disturbing. I am amazed by the deep knowledge of art and history Orhan Pamuk possesses and is capable of not just imagining the story of that period but also to represent the intricate details in such a beautiful way that it felt like observing all of it as a master miniaturist examining an extraordinary work of art with his magnifying lens. The art of painting is already lost and is not something which is found among Muslims nowadays, this quote from the book concludes sadly what we have lost: \u201cJust as the doors of houses are closed of an evening and the city is left to darkness, painting was also abandoned. It was mercilessly forgotten that we\u2019d once looked upon our world quite differently\u201d Source: Ishaque Abbas 's review of My Name is Red ",

            "answer_text": "Set in late 16th century ottoman empire, this mesmerising tale blends philosophy and art with thriller and archaic Islamic views. Orhan Pamuk has brilliantly used the style of metafiction to nest stories within a story. The best part of the book that i find is every character introduces himself to the reader and at the same time talks with the reader. Pamuk has been extremely intelligent in restricting the expression of characters to a limit where they don\u2019t reveal much about themselves and the same time takes the story forward by giving space to other characters. This book also takes you along a journey where you will witness how a murder mystery gets unraveled by examining the paintings and different styles of miniatiurist and illustrationist. The real identiy of the murderer will hook you till the end and meanwhile make you guess the prospective murderer. I personally find this magnum opus by Pamuk a fasinating read, where every character engulfs you into his own mind as if you were a part of it. Pamuk has very smartly scattered the pearls of philosophy complementing the story and some them requires a reader to ponder over it for sometime to get a obvious meaning out of them, one such pearl that i liked the most is \u201cI don\u2019t want to be tree, I want to be its meaning\u201d. If you haven\u2019t read this book so far, I recommend you to add it to your reading list because most of the statements from this book will outlive its pages and will flow into your veins. ",
