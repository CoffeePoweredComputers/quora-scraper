            "answer_text": "1) first draft your project on a piece of paper, not crossing the page.  2) then select the imperative parts that are going to be useful for the entire piece 3) make sure you summaries everything but not the climax/conclusion in the ineofuction. Introduction should be only about the basic points that you're going to elaborate 4) don't forget to summarize the entire piece at the end and start the sentence with \"thus or therefore\" and so on.  Hope that helps. ",
