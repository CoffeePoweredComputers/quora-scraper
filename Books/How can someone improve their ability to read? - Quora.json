            "answer_text": "So from my experience I can tell you what makes me understand more when reading. It's nothing difficult to do. But I cannot guarantee these will work for you. I usually don't understand my readings because I am not comfortable either with what I read or in my position. Read things that you like. It can be difficult to find your favourite style/author/genre. Don't waste time with books you don't like reading. If you literally have to force yourself to read it, it's not worth a while. If it's a compulsory literature, try to find something about it that interests you. There is no shame in not finishing a book that you just cannot bring yourself to enjoy and like. Make yourself comfortable. If it's winter, don't get cold, if it's summer don't be overheated. It is nothing but a distraction to your brain. (In winter, I love to snuggle in my bed, with a cup of tea and a lit candle in my room. In summer it's difficult because I don't have an ac so I like to go out in a park, sit under a tree and have some cold drink with me. All these things make me comfy and relaxed.) If there is something that is driving you crazy, or something you've been thinking a lot about in the past few minutes, try to get rid of those thoughts or feelings, otherwise you'll be thinking about them whilst reading and that is no good for you if you want to understand what the text is about. You can go for a jog to clear your head. (If you are a skilled reader, then books can help you actually run away from those thoughts, but about that later.)Find time for your reading. Some people like to read in the morning, some at night before they go to sleep. Some more skilled readers read everywhere - on buses, trains, while exercising or any other activity because they can detach themselves from reality into the reading. (I read mostly in my bed and on buses when there is nothing better to do. I have a graphic imagination and everything and anything I read I see through my eyes as continuous events. Once I couldn't remember what film that was I've seen, before realizing it was a book.)If you cannot focus on reading, try to get rid of all the distraction in you room. Your phone, tablet, laptop are things that will make you distracted screaming \"check me!\" and therefore thinking about it all the time instead of reading and really focusing. If it's a school work or an article on the internet, print it, if you cannot print it you can try and get out of the reach of the internet connection. You can grab your readings and go sit in the kitchen, bathroom or even toilet. (I found out that sitting on the toilet studying is way more beneficial for me than being in my room because there is simply nothing else to do there.)Make notes about what you read. So for me when I have to study something for school I'm not enthusiastic about I make notes. I read every paragraph twice. Once for getting a general idea of what it is about and second time for picking up the most important information and writing it down. You can do the same thing with a book. Keep a reading journal. If you find something very interesting or important, write it down. If you get a thought about something, write it down. If it's your own book and you're comfortable with writing into it, write notes on the sides with a pencil. Then when you finish the book you can go over the notes and your brain will bring the information to light again.Make sure you understand the vocabulary. If it's your native language there shouldn't be a problem, but sometimes it can happen that there is a word you haven't heard of before. Don't be afraid of looking it up, it might be one of the things that make you confused about the text later. If you get a word you don't know (you can underline it with a pencil for example) and the next ten sentences don't make sense to you, then it was probably important. (I get this sometimes because English is not my native language and I just have to consult a dictionary. No shame in that. :) )I didn't expect to write such a stretch of text so I hope I didn't make you confused or anything and you understood my bambling.  But just to sum it up, there are six points I made. Read things you like.Make yourself comfortable.Find the perfect time for reading.Get rid of all the distractions.Make notes about what you read.Make sure you understand the vocabulary.Also, I want to point out that I am not a professional reader and I don't understand any psychology behind it. I read a lot and I wrote down things that help me and that I do when I find out that I have no idea what I'm reading about. So I hope some of this will be useful to you. And lastly, thank you for your question, because it brought me to thinking about this, and surely, even I learnt something new. Have a nice day, stranger. ;) ",

            "answer_text": " Make it all about developing your reading skill. Because, like with most things you do on a regular basis, reading should be more about developing a skill and less about finishing up a task. Did you notice that shift\u2014from task to skill? That\u2019s a shift in your mindset that you can make, and it\u2019s so small you\u2019ll barely notice it. It won\u2019t take much effort, but look at what you can achieve by doing it. First, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re taking charge over your learning process. Second, you\u2019ll soon understand you can get proactive so reading becomes a deliberate act in how you process information, rather than a passive act of being on the receiving end of what you see on each page. And third, you\u2019ll realize that like with any other skill, reading is one that you can develop, improve, and master over time. Now that we\u2019ve covered why your mindset about reading is important, let\u2019s move on to specific activities you can do to develop your reading skill. Here are 3 reading tips that can help. Reading tip #1. Start writing things down. Why? If you want to better understand what you read, it\u2019s a good idea to create a system for the entire reading process. In other words, you can give your reading experience more structure so that you can process, retrieve, and recall the material more easily. A good way to do it is to take notes. What are the benefits? Taking notes is a valuable skill to learn not just for the sake of giving your reading experience more structure. It\u2019s also really good for your brain because it helps to amplify your focus and concentration, makes retaining and recalling information easier, boosts your cognitive skills, strengthens memory, and engages your critical thinking skills. How do you do it? Dedicate a notebook to your reading. Then, as you read through articles and books, start a note on each one by writing the title, author\u2019s name, and date when you read it (I usually just write the month and year), which can be an added memory boost when you look at your notes later.Focus on key concepts, ideas, and topics. Don\u2019t make it a goal to write down every little thing you read. That will take forever and you won\u2019t benefit from your notes. Instead, boost your critical thinking skills by identifying what is relevant to the topic. If you\u2019re not sure how to begin, try the Cornell Method of taking notes.Write notes in list format. This saves time, enables you to skim the material when you need it, helps you locate information faster, and makes the review process easier.Tap into your creative side with drawing and color. Your notes don\u2019t need to be only in text format. You can draw squares, rectangles, or circles around the main topics, ideas and concepts. Use markers or highlighters to prioritize concepts, with one color to mark main ideas and another to illustrate examples. This helps the most important information stand out and makes it easier to find later when you need it.Reading tip #2. Become a storyteller. Why? The very act of storytelling makes any material come alive, whether you\u2019re reading about fundamentals of macroeconomics or the history of ancient Egypt. Storytelling is a great way to take the next step in the learning process. It\u2019s being proactive about what you\u2019re absorbing, instead of passively reading and just moving on to the next thing. What are the benefits? Telling a story about what you read is easy to practice because it\u2019s not formal so there isn\u2019t pressure to make it perfect. It also gives you confidence by strengthening your knowledge of the study material, and it boosts your memorization. You can review, recall, and retain what you\u2019ve learned better and more effectively. How do you do it? Find your audience. It can be a friend, roommate, study partner, sibling, parent, neighbor, or cousin.Find the right time. Don\u2019t just assume everyone will want to pause what they\u2019re doing and pay attention to you. Pick a time when they\u2019re not in the middle of working or finishing up a task, so they can also enjoy the story. For example, you can talk while taking a walk together, having dinner, or just chilling out in the evening.Make it concise. Nobody wants to sit through an hour\u2019s worth of your talking, especially if it\u2019s during their downtime and not an obligation to do so. Think about what is the main point of what you read that you\u2019d like to share, and then explain it in a few minutes. This will force you to prioritize what is the most important piece of the material you read.Make it lively. Your story doesn\u2019t have to be a list of important concepts. It\u2019s a story, remember? And a good story always has something extra in it to keep our attention and boost our imagination. To make your story interesting, mention an example you really liked and say why you liked it. Add a detail that you found fascinating or unusual. If there\u2019s something that was not clear to you, mention that too. It\u2019s an excellent way to prompt your friend to give their take on what they heard.Encourage dialogue. OK, so you told your story. What next? Use the opportunity to get your friend\u2019s opinion and point of view. Ask them if they heard or read anything similar, and you might get a recommendation of what to read next. Share your opinions and turn it into a conversation so that you can both benefit from the experience by making it more meaningful.Reading tip #3. Incorporate it into your day. Why? Chances are much greater that you\u2019ll remember details of what you read if you apply them to your life in some way. It\u2019s another example of being proactive with what you are reading. What are the benefits? When you apply the details of what you\u2019ve read to your life, it means you are making a connection between learning something new and the way you think, study, work, or communicate with others. In other words, you are applying that knowledge to something concrete and tangible that can benefit you. How do you do it? Reinforce your knowledge throughout the day. When you are on your commute or walking or running errands, ask yourself what were the key concepts from the article or book you\u2019re reading. Go over them, remembering what you wrote in your notes and how you emphasized each point. This added repetition of newly learned material will reinforce your knowledge of it even more.Use it to generate more ideas. Sometimes reading an article can give us ideas on how to do our job better or how to improve one area of our life. For example, we can learn about developing a new habit, practicing a skill, achieving mastery at something, or just going more in depth on a topic that we find fascinating. It\u2019s an excellent starting point to do more research on what interests us.Take one idea or concept, then practice it. Of course, every piece of new material you read, whether it\u2019s an article from a news website or a classic work of literary fiction, will be full of details and new information. You don\u2019t need to practice every little detail or idea. Find one idea that you liked, then find ways to practice it at work or school. It can be learning a different technique to getting your job done, or practicing a small habit to make your day more productive. Whatever it is, select something that can help you improve your life in some way so that you can really feel the benefit of reading and learning something new.",
