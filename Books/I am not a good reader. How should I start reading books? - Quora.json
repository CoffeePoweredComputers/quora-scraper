            "answer_text": "Reading can be tough because when you read you need to focus. When you lack imagination and just read the book mindlessly you can never realise the importance of reading and how much pleasure or happiness it can bring you. Some people's lives or family are books. Books are that great but if you are a non reader you will never understand that. Anyway. Falling in love with reading and experiencing it pleasure of reading was great. Lets me start from how great is reading is. When you read particular book it's like as if you are living in the story. And when you close or done reading that book that's the moment you will feel as if someone pulled you back to reality. Reading can make you forget all your problems just like sleep does and remember a book can also understand your pain or listen to you. As per me reading in like traveling in imagination of the author. Anyways, moving on. If you wanna get interested in reading a book or be a better reader the first step is you need to find a book of a genre that will interest you. If you are interested in fantasies you can choose that or whatsoever. When I started reading, the first thing I did was look for pictures in it. Also the tough vocabulary in those books always made it hard for me to read the book. Then I slowly started reading books from my favourite genre and the words that was hard for me to pronounce or I didn't understand it meaning I either asked my mum the meaning of it or just searched it meaning on Google. There are still times I don't understand some scene of the book so I keep reading it over to understand. Also if you are a beginner you should start reading books whose author doesn't use too many difficult words to understand. Like I started reading comic s first, then it came to the short stories and later I started reading goosebumps. Then finally I started reading novels. So yea if you want you improve your reading follow three easy steps:- Focus on whatever you are reading. If you don't understand it read it as many times until you understand the concept or the specific scene.Choose a book of your favourite genre because that will let your mind to force you to read the book.Don't jump of books that contains complicated words for you to understand. Either start from a simple book that will be easier for you to read or else if someone recommend s you to read a book that contains complicated words start looking for it's meaning because that's how reading improves your vocabulary. I hope this helps to in improving your reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Start small grow very slowly but set goals. Start with a goal of one book by the end of the month or maybe two month time frame. Do not move beyond that goal until sometime in 2021. If you read 12 books in a single year you would read more than quite a lot of people. Pick only topics you love\u2014go for low hanging fruit. If you watch sci-movies read a sci-fi. If you like super-hero movies, romance or other topics start there. Do not deviate from topics that you love until sometime in 2021. Block off reading time. Time where you read and do nothing else (pending emergencies). Close your laptop, turn off you phone do nothing but read at that time. Give a comfort space. A lounge chair, a sun room, hot tea, whatever it takes to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. You are going to be out of your normal zone so setting an atmosphere that you like is important. Benchmark your accomplishments but do not try to keep raising your goals. If you made your goal one book a month \u2014keep it there but keep a log of the books you read in 2020. Spend some amount of time researching what to read but not too much time. Spend a weekend or a evening figuring out what to read next but don\u2019\u2019t turn it into a week long searching project. Take a break between reading books. Don\u2019t drive from one book to the next. You may develop that personality one day but at a time where you don\u2019t read that is going way too fast. Enjoy your new hobby and welcome to the (book) club! ",
