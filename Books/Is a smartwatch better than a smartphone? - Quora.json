            "answer_text": "when you feel hungry, you can have biscuits as you cannot really carry whole meal with you everywhere. think of eating just biscuits as your whole meal to stuff up your tummy. sounds weird na??? smartwatch is like an accessory to your phone. standalone smartwatches, no doubt, possess same functionality but in real world their usage is limited and one cannot literally type, browse, or take great pictures. they are good for instant notifications, emergency calls when you are out of phone and navigation while driving bike. but they cannot replace one\u2019s smartphone at all.

            "answer_text": "I believe that there are a handful of worthwhile advantages. For one, you have most of the actively accessed information readily available to you directly from your wrist. That saves space, and in some cases the time it takes to pull your phone from your pocket or wherever it is kept. By having a Smartwatch on your wrist\u2014you have access to the date, time, calendar, texting, calling, health tracking, music, alarms, weather and etc. These are the things that I usually have to check on my phone\u2014albeit thanks to heads-up displays I no longer have to press any buttons or tap the screen to see the date, time, weather, and notifications. The other major advantage I see applies to athletics and non-sedentary lifestyles. If you want to go for a run, and not carry along your phone, but still have commonly used smartphone functions\u2014you can. If you want to go to the gym and lift and do a bunch of calisthenics and jump rope\u2014your phone isn\u2019t holding you down. It\u2019s just more convenient, to have your most commonly used smartphone functions at your disposal from your wrist. ",
