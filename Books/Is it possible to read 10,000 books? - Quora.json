            "answer_text": "I wrote 9259 answers. When I joined Quora in 2014, I never imagined I would even cross 100 answers. Many times I stopped writing and went away from Quora. But I always got my way back here and wrote answers. I wrote on various topics ranging from books to history. I wrote one-liners, short stories, 2\u20133 line answers and long answers as well. I did not think I ever reach 9259 answers. I am close to 10000 answers but I do not know when I will accomplish it. Or even if I get it. But one thing I know for sure \u2014 writing is fun. I learn. I like it writing and expressing my thoughts. And, books reading is no different. It is quite possible to read 10000 books. But it will depend upon how passionate you are for reading, what kind of books you are reading, and what is the count of the pages of every book. So it all depends on different factors. It is difficult to say when you will accomplish reading 10000 books. Only time can tell. So forget about time and count of books, focus on enjoying what you read and what did you learn from them. To change your life, sometimes one book is enough. Have fun!! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a very passionate books, and in 2016 and 2017 I've read around 100 books per year. This means an average of 2 books a week. I work freelance, just couple of hrs a day and I spend the rest of the time reading, so it's already an hard challenge to achieve. But 100 books a year, I will need 100 years to reach 10.000 books\u2026. normally people start reading at age 5-6 (but not 100 books a year) and after the age of 85\u201390 is difficult to have the mind for it. So it's quite unreal and unbelievable. To be \u201creal\" you should read 200 books a year, every year between 15 and 65\u2026 4 books a week, about an average of 1000 pages in 7 days for 50 years\u2026 ",
