            "answer_text": "It depends upon what kind of science fiction you want to write. You could write short stories like those written in the golden age of science fiction by Heinlein, Asimov, and Dick, but at the extreme end, you have the really popular science fiction which is part of a franchise. If that latter kind is what you mean, then really successful science fiction is the crossroads of three well-executed skills. First, you have to create a problem to solve. It can be something like a planet-killing machine, an intergalactic conspiracy, an impending artificial intelligence overthrow, the end of our species, or anything you like. Your solution has to be innovative, interesting, and compelling. Problem: The new Death Star has a shield! Answer: A ragtag band of special forces will take out the generators. They'll need to forge an alliance with some overgrown teddy bears to do it. Problem: There is a corpse in a room. We can't figure out how he died except to blame a robot. That cannot be without violating the three laws. Answer: It was the police officer who was first on the scene. Problem: The ship is about to blow up. Answer: Eject the warp core, but you\u2019ll have to sacrifice an important and well-loved character. This brings up the next important skill. Second, you need great characters and interactions between those characters. I could point to lots of franchises like Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, and the like. They all have that great chemistry going on. Love stories, brotherhood, enemies-become-friends, etc. Groups work better than individuals. Characters sacrifice for each other, sometimes while Aerosmith wails in the background. Finally, third, I would suggest that you need a seriously cool world to explore. Remember exploring the galaxy far far away? Narnia? Hogwarts? I know they aren't all science fiction, but the same rules exist. There\u2019s more to it than that, of course, but this should get you started. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you writing because that\u2019s what you are, who you are, and you must? Or because you got a good idea \u2013 maybe \u2013 and want to be rich and famous? If the latter, don\u2019t bother reading any more. Remember that because it\u2019s sci-fi \u2013 or speculative fiction \u2013 you are still telling a story and it better be a good one. Plot, sense of place, interesting characters and their arcs, an internal logic and a good writing style are still vital. You cannot get away with writing badly simply because you have a great science/speculative concept. The following assumes you\u2019re a writing newbie. Read the greats. You could begin with Gulliver\u2019s Travels, the adult version. Then Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. Jules Verne. HG Wells. Delve into the American mags like Astounding Science Fiction, see the writers who began there. Check out the seminal sci-fi movies, like Metropolis, Destination Moon, The Day The Earth stood Still. Do not get seduced by Star Trek or Star Wars. Brilliant as they are, you want to write something original. Go buy a copy of Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, still the best guide to writing a story (and in most good screenwriters\u2019 bookshelves). Learn about the three and five act plot. Nothing says you have to follow them. But learn the rules before you break them. Start writing. Begin with brief descriptions of people you\u2019ve seen, places you like or hate. Move into trying a short story. Learn how to put yourself on the page without being pretentious and boring. Discover your voice. Begin your novel. Overwrite. Don\u2019t edit in your head, yet. Just get it down. For every three, maybe four pages of text expect to end up with one page that\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll get better as time goes on. You might even get to three for one. If your book is very science oriented, remember most people need to have the hard stuff explained. Or at least glossed over in a convincing manner. A plot that hangs on the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle will only interest a few. . . unless it results in human conflict. Some people swear by writing groups. Others find them destructive. If you can find one led by a successful professional writer who\u2019s interested in teaching, not an ego boost, and can control a group, okay. Otherwise stay clear. They can be destructive. Finish your first draft. Wait a week. Do it again. And again. Assuming your plot holds up, characters are fine etc, you now have a sci-fi novel. It might even be a good one. Do not expect it to be published. Find an agent. Yeah, right. Finding an agent and getting published the first time is often like running at a brick wall head first. Eventually the wall falls down. But it ain\u2019t half painful. Good luck. You\u2019ll need it. ",
