            "answer_text": "Heaven help you, my friend. You're in for a long and arduous journey. First, did you just finish writing it or have you just finished editing it? If you haven't edited or have edited only for spelling or grammar, you're not ready for publication. It typically takes multiple rounds of heavy editing (plot, layout, themes, etc) with the very last being a spell check, so if you haven't gotten through those yet I recommend getting on it. Many writers think they're exempt from this. Don't be one of those writers. Those writers don't get published. If you've done all that, edit once more for good measure. But if you're sure it can be polished no more, then you'll need to start looking at lit agents. A simple Google search will bring up pages of reputable lit agencies. It's your job to research to find agents that are seeking or are currently representing works similar to yours. I recommend making a list of what they've represented in the past that's like yours, tweets or interview answers they've given that suggest your work would be a good fit for them, and anything else that makes your work relevant to what they're representing. Make sure they're currently accepting unsolicited submissions and find out exactly what they want in the submission package. Then, with that list in hand, write your individual query letters. Personalize each one, don't take the easy way out and make a one-size-fits-all query letter. They should be specific. Send them in batches and not to every agent on the list at once, because it allows you to take any feedback you're lucky enough to get from other agents and apply it to future queries. You can also send your submission packages to small to medium sized presses, but I advise against sending to vanity presses. If they ask for money, run. Anyway, you'll likely get many, many rejections. Allow yourself to be upset if you need to, but don't beat yourself up over it. Some will, hopefully, request a partial or full manuscript. Buy yourself some champagne, because even if they pass, that's a win. You'll still get rejections, but it's promising. If the stars align, one of those many agents will send you an offer of representation, and it's up to you whether their terms are acceptable. If they aren't, you decline, if they are, then you sign the contract and celebrate. The agent then takes your novel and approaches publishers on your behalf. Again, many rejections will likely take place. But we hope for one saying yes. Again, if fate smiles upon you, you'll get an offer and you can decline or accept. More champagne. Maybe two bottles. Then you'll likely go through more editing, and you'll continue marketing yourself and your novel. Because you should constantly be marketing your brand, not in a sleazy car salesman way but in an organic way that makes sense. Most publishers and agents will expect a platform anyway, so I've assumed you've had one. This is a really condensed step by step process. Trying to get a novel published is an excruciating process. But if you make it, it's such a wonderful thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Edit and rewrite it over and over and over. Put it through tools like Grammarly Free. Then decide if you want to go traditional, that requires an agent unless your book is science fiction, horror, fantasy, or romance. If you books fits those catagories it needs to be sized according to publisher specs (romance around 80K and the others are 100K). You also need to find a list of publishers (they are out they, do a Google search) and follow their submission rules TO THE LETTER. Same goes for agents. Follow what they say to the letter. Write a query letter for each agent and use THEIR ACTUAL NAME. Most ask for the first 50 pages. Make sure there are NO MISTAKES. One goof and they will trash your submission. Expect to get rejected. We all do I\u2019ve been getting rejections for 60 years. I get a few acceptance letters and checks, but very few. It\u2019s like 500:1 rejections verses publication. If you don\u2019t like those odds self-publish through Kindle. MAKE SURE you FORMAT for each method. Agents and publishers don\u2019t like indentations. They want an extra space between paragraphs. They want it double spaced and ragged right edge as a general rule (remember to look at their specific requirements). Self-Publishing wants it single space. Either a blank line between paragraphs or you use the PARAGRAPH function set for something like 0.20\u2033 NEVER use TAB or SPACES for indenting. Self-Publishing wants you to INSERT A PAGE BREAK between TITLE, COPYRIGHT, CONTENTS and each CHAPTER, plus other books and author info. You should highlight your chapter titles or numbers and make them STYLE HEADING 1. You can center or left flush the titles. It can be justified or ragged edge. For eBooks if you want a table of contents for Kindle you can use the Microsoft Word Table of Contents took. But that usually won\u2019t work for Nook Books. The alternative is highlighting the chapter title/number and using the BOOKMARK tool (clear it first) for each one. Then set up a contents page and use the HYPERLINK tool to link that BOOKMARK in your DOCUMENT. It should make a set of links. You can test them <CTRL> right mouse click. You may need to redo them There are videos on YouTube to help you. For print books you need to MIRROR the page and set the PAGE SIZE and MARGINS These are my starting points. 6 x 9 trade publication inner 0.68 outer 0.36 top 0.46 bottom 0.32 footer spacing 0.47 auto fit height 4.25 x 7 Pocket Book inner 0.74 outer 0.40 top 0.38 bottom 0.24 footer spacing 0.20 auto fit height This uses a PAGE NUMBER in the CENTER of the FOOTER You need to alter the contents. Microsoft Word will add the page number. Otherwise you have to do that manually. Chapter Title/Numbers are generally 1/4 to 1/3 down the page The chapter text starts 1/3 to 1/2 down the page. You CAN use FANCY FONTS for chapter titles/numbers (but these won\u2019t work for eBooks only print books). You CAN make an eBook using the Print Book formatting. ",
