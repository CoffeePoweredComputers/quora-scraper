            "answer_text": "Voice Over, in its many forms and variants is a hot-topic, big button subject these days.  It's important to understand that technology today makes it possible for a single person to narrate, record, edit and \"polish\" a books audio from almost anywhere in the world. When you combine this to the perceived ease of entry, the lack of even low paying jobs, the ability for single parents, people with physical limitations, etc. to do this work from a home studio, it's easy to see why so many people are looking for their slice of the pie. In a very short time, Amazon, with their ACX program has manged to get their meat hooks into controlling a very large piece of that pie, and I might suggest you do some digging around ACX and their programs.  I have been working voice over for over 20 years and at one time I did a considerable amount of audio book work. We called it \"books on tape\". Sadly, what used to be a $3,000 - $5,000 paycheck for me, now tends to pay under $1,000. And the biggest kicker is that when I recorded the books, I didn't have to edit them. You don't have to now, but if you don't, be prepared to give up a third to half of that $1,000 to an editor. So, your aunt will need to pay for and have access to a professional sounding home recording studio. Will need to learn how to use the tools to record herself. Spend some amount of time learning the \"walk\" and the \"talk\" that accompanies this work. She will need to create \"demos\", essentially snippets of her reading various styles of books. Probably pay for a website and some other online presence. Audition a lot against a very crowded field. Expect to get some work that will pay next to nothing, in the hopes she can work her way up the ladder. There really is quite a bit of information online, but then realize that the teaching of this stuff, along with books, workshops, etc, is a billion dollar business.  If you're familiar with the California gold Rush, you'll know that most of the prospectors made very little, but the people selling the shovels and pickaxes and food and places to sleep, etc., all got rich. Voice over is a lot like that. ",

            "answer_text": "i record books for Storytel, whose HQ is in Sweden, but they recently opened an office in Singapore, presumably as part of their drive to record more Asian authors/books, and membership gives you access to over 120,000 audio-books. There was a piece in the newspaper about them, so i contacted the journalist who wrote the story and she put me in contact with the Content Manager. I emailed her a demo tape of me reading three books (two pages per book): if I\u2019d been more aware I would have included one fiction, one young adult and one non-fiction. That was in May and I\u2019ve been very fortunate, doing one book a month since. (one novel, one YA fiction, and two non-fiction). As with any genre, I imagine that certain types of voice would be more suited to Children\u2019s fiction - certainly a facility with different voices, (how good are you at talking rabbits and devious felines?) and a warm upbeat delivery. Maybe join a an audio-book company for a month and listen to a variety of readers read? However, rather than categorise yourself, I would suggest you send a variety of sample readings that demonstrate different qualities of your voice/reading skills and let the content manager decide - hopefully she\u2019ll hear you and think, \u201cWow, that\u2019s just the voice we need for . . . .\u201d (see my note in the final paragraph) I was expecting to record at home, but Storytel prefers me to go into a recording studio, in order to ensure audio quality - so I don\u2019t have to edit, or invest in a mic or sound proof room at home, which others cite as downsides. Storytel offered me a choice of recording studios so I opted for one that is a 25 minute drive from home. I used to do voice-over commercials occasionally, but gave up because every time you had to nickel-and-dime over your fee and then often had to wait 3\u20136 months to get paid because the ad agencies always blamed their clients for late payment. Storytel has paid promptly with a month of my recording going into their catalogue. I have a contract and they abide by it. While a commercial which will pay you much more per sec for your 30 seconds, an audio book, even at say $150 an hour of recorded time, provides a decent supplement to a freelancer\u2019s monthly income - especially as it\u2019s down time, so there\u2019s not a lost-opportunity cost. (My last book was 10.50 hours of recorded time and took me almost 16 hours studio time.) Narrating a book is a stimulating creative challenge and results in something your great great grand-children can listen to ( if you think the internet will last that long!) It\u2019s far less stressful than trying to fit too many words into a 30 second ad, and you won\u2019t face ethical issues of peddling commercial crap which you personally wouldn\u2019t use yourself or want your kids to eat? (Storytel offered me Paul Callan\u2019s excellent novel, The Brigadier\u2019s Daughter but highlighted that there was some graphic sexual content, and gave me the option to decline it. But I didn\u2019t (and delivering those scenes was another new challenge in itself!) Being assigned an audio book may well introduce you to an author/genre/knowledge-base with which you are totally unfamiliar. ",
