            "answer_text": "Can a writer change the perspective of a story? If you mean \u201cviewpoint\u201d or \u201cpoint of view\u201d \u2026 yes, you can \u2026 but in short work you SHOULDN\u2019T. As to why it\u2019s \u201cdiscouraged\u201d as mentioned by another poster, is each viewpoint dilutes and dissipates the strength of the narrative. Often writers use other viewpoints to communicate things they feel are necessary to the understanding of the story\u2019s epiphany. If the detail is important, you should have figured out how to communicate it in the SINGLE viewpoint. This comes round to how characters need four basic things for you to depict them properly and show their growth: A goal \u2014 initially the character will have some short term objective. However, when they come into contact with the story problem they will have a target to shoot for to resolve the conflict. The goal may change as the stakes in the story change\u2026A desire \u2014 something that they are striving for, something they will fight and struggle to accomplish.A secret need \u2014 this can be the same thing as the character\u2019s desire, but in stories with some kind of epiphany or self discovery\u2026 the protagonist eventually exchanges their desire for their need (epiphany). In Star Wars, Luke\u2019s desire was to go to the academy and learn to fly. He sympathized with the rebellion but wasn\u2019t motivated to join the cause. When his aunt and uncle are killed by the evil empire, his desire for revenge pushes him toward his need, and that is to find purpose in social responsibility and becoming a user of the force. So, Luke\u2019s secret need was to become a Jedi.Stakes \u2014 this is what the protagonist cares about. Luke cared about his aunt and uncle. The empire killed them. This was his failure. When he is motivated by revenge, the new stakes become the freedom of the republic, and rebel alliance. Now, the problem is the Death Star is coming to destroy the rebels. So, now they must destroy the Death Star. If they fail, they lose. This win/lose consequence should be pervasive in the story and why it\u2019s so important that a character have something under threat to maintain tension in the narrative.If you have only a short story length to establish these things for the protagonist\u2026 isn\u2019t it best just to accomplish this?

            "answer_text": "There are times when writing for a character that a male writer switches from he to me instead. It\u2019s not likely for a female character that a male writer switches like that. Another situation is when referring to an animal being called he in one line and it in another. So if that really gets out of hand then the writer may need to use the search and replace feature that word processors may provide. That can also apply to web pages, too. The search and switch being made for one word at a time, rather than for every time a certain word would appear in the text. A decision must be made for either the switch or the stay. Then the text can be saved as it should have been written. : ",

In the US if it happens too much it is called \u201chead hopping\u201d and is discouraged for some reason - but in other countries it\u2019s not a big deal if the story takes different character\u2019s perspectives.

In each round the story advanced from four perspectives as the voice went from pure, to a little edgy, to openly racist to innocent round after round. The secret is held out to the end of a long narrative. Hope it works for readers. ",
