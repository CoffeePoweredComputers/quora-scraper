            "answer_text": "I am currently a student of Data Science Career Track at Springboard (April 2020 cohort) and guess I am fairly informed to narrate my experience so far Course Content The course content is curated and consists of a wide variety of topics (right from Programming fundamentals and Statistics to start with) in a proper flow which enables synchronous learning. The content is sourced from a wide range of partners like DataCamp, LinkedIn Learning and Youtube and given these sources themselves update their content on a regular basis, you always get the latest and most updated material. For a field like Data Science, updated curriculum becomes a must-have. Assignments and Mini Projects You have plenty of them to continuously supplement your learning of concepts with hands-on. For someone who has a non-technical background previously, this becomes essential so as to not feel overwhelmed with lots of coding and no hand-holding initially. Mentorship You get matched with an industry mentor who has nearly similar years of experience in the industry. Not only does this foster a match in terms of mindset but also ensures a very open conversation flow between the two. Additionally, your mentor will direct you to a lot of additional online materials to supplement your learning Eg:- My mentor has 6+ years of experience (same as mine) Office Hours While the weekly office hours are on a wide range of topic and not necessarily related to your progress on the course (not sure if that is even possible given a rolling cohort model of admission), they are a great insight into how Data Science is applied in the industry and the speakers give a lot of leads in terms of additional materials related to the topic of discussion. A brief note down of such leads act as great supplementary material when you are actually learning the topic General Tips to benefit from any online MOOC/Bootcamp Data Science, as a pathway, requires continuous learning beyond standard classroom methodology and the more materials you refer to while building your foundational concepts, the better your understanding will be. Springboard\u2019s course gives you that direction and streamlines your learning path along with a mentor who will help you navigate in this journey. PS:- This is not a paid/biased review since I chose Springboard after going through several online bootcamp offerings (GreyAtom, Lambda School, RMOTR etc.) For any further details on this, please feel free to DM me. While I might not be a data science expert yet, however I am happy to guide you in terms of how to leverage this career track and stay motivated all the way through. And regarding the worthyness of the course, having invested my hard-earned money into this, it\u2019s highly recommended with the caveat that be prepred to grill yourself and as long as you keep up your motivation high, you will definitely see the benefit of this learning journey as you proceed along.

            "answer_text": "Springboard India Data Science Career Track - Worst Online learning Experience\" Trapping People into Joining: I joined Springboard DSC with lot of hopes to make a transition from my current role. There were very less reviews of Springboard India when I joined, now I realized that Springboard team deletes all the negative reviews for trapping people into this horrible course. I was misguided by the multiple promises made by the admission team during my enrollment.Course Content: Springboard charges Rs.1, 75,000 for the course. The course content doesn\u2019t teach fundamentals which are very important in long run. Not even a 10% of the content is of Springboard\u2019s own content. More than 60% of the course content is from YouTube and CS lectures which are available for free in the internet. For every topic, they redirect you to either YouTube or some articles in the internet. Most of the curriculum revolves around YouTube and Datacamp courses. Even after repeated feedback on the content, they never even tried to change anything in the content. The content should be thoroughly validated by any industry expert.Office Hours: This is a complete waste of one hour session. There is no thinking into conducting these sessions. These are only to attract new students by taking sessions on random topics. They don\u2019t care about the understanding level of students.Support team: There are only two teaching assistants assigned to help all of the Springboard DSC students in India. Whenever someone approaches them with any doubt, they just share an article link without explaining much. Nobody validates the projects/assignments which will be submitted to Springboard as part of their curriculum. There will be no feedback on the projects done.Finally the Springboard management team, they will be calling continuously until you pay the fee, once the fee is paid. They don\u2019t care whether you are doing the course or not.If you have any plans for learning Data Science course, then don\u2019t join Springboard course in particular. There are lots of institutes offering better content at 1/100th of the amount Springboard charges.I Wish, I could get my money back. This post is only to save lot of Data Science enthusiasts from falling into this trap. ",
