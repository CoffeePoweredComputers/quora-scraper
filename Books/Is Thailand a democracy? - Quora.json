            "answer_text": "Thailand is not a democracy under the definition from the world view, but rather a hybrid regime. I want to clarify that a hybrid regime has an element of both democracy (under restricted condition) and authoritarianism to restore the national order from preventing the country into the deeper turmoil. The fact is there has been more than 30 coup d'\u00e9tat attempts ever since 1932, when this nation has been declared under a constitutional monarchy. The statistical data below is the democracy index from the fiscal year 2018:   I rather begin the history from the political calamity since 2014 and onward. The military junta indeed took over the political power from the escalating dispute between red shirt party and yellow shirt party. The military government promised to return the political power to the Government when the heat dies down over time. Thai populations accepted the public vow, and comprehended the situation that the military government needed to restore peace and order. This situation did not escalate to the extremist level, and a deployment of the military personnel was not necessary to control the street. The heat had cooled down over time until 2017 (3 years later). The Thai populations had a notion that the military government should relinquish the political power as promised, and demanded the reelection to take place. The populations began to roister and protest against the military government for violating the public vow that was announced earlier to the people.    Protesters had continued to pressure the military government since then until the public sector had no choice, but to enable the reelection in early 2019 (2 years later). This reelection was to maintain the populations in control before the unfortunate situation turned into violent riots in the country. The military government had also suffered from an international obscurity through time as well, while misunderstanding Thailand to govern under an authoritarian regime. There were several political parties that participated in the election process, however the image below demonstrated the three (3) most popular political parties in Thailand. There were center-left, center-right, and populist that acquired the considerable popular vote thus far.  The reelection took place, and the final result turned out the military government became the elected Prime Minister of Thailand through the legal election protocol. The UN perceives the Thailand\u2019s election to meet the democratic standard, and most foreign news do not comprehend the situation beyond what I will say next. The Future Forward Party (after Future Power Party lost the election) suspected there had to be an unusual election process going on through the legal protocol. This Party recruited and assembled the human resources through the empowerment of young-generation individuals who have broader/international visions to oppose against the current elected head of government. The current situation is now a card game between the two rival parties, whether who will be the first to expose their political flaw. Stay tune for more!    I can say for certain that several foreigners have a false assumption, or they are being mislead toward the misinformation/disinformation about this nation being an authoritarian regime. I clarified earlier with the given definition that Thailand has always been a hybrid regime from 2014, which is different from an authoritarian regime in every manners. I am often annoyed/irritated with a foreign news that cannot distinguish the difference between the hybrid and authoritarian regime. I am also not sure whether CNN, nor BBC could also tell the difference between full democracy and flawed democracy in the western countries. I can also say for certain that the United States is a flawed democracy, whereas the Commonwealth realm (Canada, the UK, New Zealand, and Australia) is a full democracy under the British crown. I always thought Donald Trump is a lousy US President, but unfortunately I tend to agree with him that all news media tend to spread false information to obscure the world. ",
