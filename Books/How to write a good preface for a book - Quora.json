You want to tantalize the reader, maybe even highlighting some of the things you want to tell them in the book that aren\u2019t directly mentioned. For instance, why did you structure the book the way you did? Maybe note certain things the reader should know before reading like symbolic use of names, etc. Never give too much away. ",
