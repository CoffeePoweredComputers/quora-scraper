            "answer_text": "Legally? Well, that complicates matters. For starters, if you want to be legal, then I\u2019d recommend AGAINST using piracy sites like readcomiconline.to and similar sites - they are just that, piracy. Their operation is illegal, and I\u2019m not sure about legality of being a READER on that site, and if you\u2019re really concerned about that, I\u2019d avoid these. However, there ARE ways you can read free comics online\u2026 just not EVERY comic will be available, obviously. There are three primary ways you can do that. First is making account on Comixology. Comixology is an online store with digital comics - basically comicbook version of Steam. And the thing is, a lot of publishers publish free samples (e.g. issue 1 of an ongoing series) there. I currently have 87 books in my Comixology library, and so far I am yet to buy an actual book (because I prefer to buy my comics physically). And some of them are even big names, like Black Widow, Batman and Daredevil! Second option is going to site Comic Book Plus - it\u2019s a site that lets you read Golden and Silver Age comics whose copyright has lapsed, and now are in public domain. As such, anyone who wants can read them. There are also other sites that let you read comics which aren\u2019t published anymore due to copyright problems - e.g. Miraclemen Archive hosts entire archive of an old superhero deconstruction comic Miracleman, which despite being regarded as one of best (and darkest) superhero comics ever made, created by legendary Alan Moore, remains in legal limbo for various reasons. EDIT: It appears that since I wrote this answer, Miraclemen Archive was sadly shut down, as Marvel solidified its grip on Miracleman property and started publishing reprints. Third option, of course, is to find some webcomics. Some webcomics like Girl Genius, Homestuck, Lackadaisy, Gunnerkrigg Court, Schlock Mercenary, Spinnerette, Atomic Robo, Kill Six Billion Demons, Ava\u2019s Demon, Johnny Wander/Barbarous are extremely high quality and are a great read! And because of nature of webcomics, many of these can clock at thousands of pages, giving one a ton of material to read. (There are also webcomics that don\u2019t follow an ongoing storyline like e.g. xkcd, but idk if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.) ",

            "answer_text": "Most of big publishers have some free downloads. It's generally promotional books -- samples to encourage you to buy more.  Except for some really old material where the copyright has lapsed, you won't find legal sites to download large amounts of comics. (And much of the stuff you can legally download is, to be blunt, crap. There's a reason the copyright was allowed to lapse.) I would recommend you consider Marvel Unlimited. $9.99 for a two month trial, then $9.99/month or $69 for a year. Think of it as being Netflix for Marvel Comics.  A massive back issue library -- not everything Marvel has ever published, but very impressive. Wanna read classic stuff old-time fans like me rave about? Claremont/Byrne X-Men? Got it. Simonson Thor? Got it. Byrne Fantastic Four? Got it. Roger Stern's twelve page back-up story \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" that has been known to leave grown men in tears? Got it.  The one big gap is any licensed material for which they don't have the license anymore -- no Micronauts, no ROM: Spaceknight, no GI Joe, no Conan, no Master of Kung-Fu. I can't say with certainty all of their current material is there, though they're doing a good of it. It does lag about six months behind what's at your local comics shop. One nice feature is that, for big crossovers, you can display the entire storyline, for every involved title, in suggested order.  Is it free? No, but look at like this: let' say you bought the $69 year package and read just one comic every day. You've paid roughly nineteen cents an issue. It's an incredibly efficient use of your comics budget. ",
