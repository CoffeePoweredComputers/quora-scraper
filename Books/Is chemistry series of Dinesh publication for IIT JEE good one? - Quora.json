            "answer_text": "Well i also had this doubt when in i was in class 11. In my case the reason being my chemistry teacher who used to design the school question paper from these books and a lot of my classmates were going to his tution , hence following this book. I once asked him, \u201csir mjhe ncert follow karna chahiye ya dinesh\u201d he replied, \u201cncert mei kya dia hai dinesh kro\u201d which was a bad suggestion. First of all dont depend too much on side books because sometimes informations given there are wrong. The reason being only 2\u20133 authors are responsible for writing and editing of a private publication book whereas in the case of ncert you will get atleast 25\u201330 writers(some being professors of iit). Now which book to follow for iitjee- organic- in my case the situation was that i learned all the reactions from ncert but some reactions which were in the syllabus of jee was not given in ncert so i needed a book that concisely only had the reactions , their mechanisms and some examples. hence i took S.N. sanyal . believe me the width of this book is harldy 1/4 of any other publication but the concept was given to the point. inorganic- totally ncert physical- once you have learned all the concepts of a chapter you need to practice them a lot to remember. Take a book which has sufficient amount of questions. In my case i solved the ncert ques. and the book N.A.awasthi which had only questions and that too given level wise. ",
