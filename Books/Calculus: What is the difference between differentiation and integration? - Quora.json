            "answer_text": "Differentiation represents the rate of change of a function.  Integration represents an accumulation or sum of a function over a range.  They are kind of inverses of each other. Let\u2019s consider an example.  If you have a tank of water with a small hole at the bottom, the water would leak out and the water level would drop in the tank.  It should be obvious from common experience, that when the tank is full, the water will spurt out faster than when the water level is very low when the water flow is just a trickle.  The amount of water leaking out each second is a rate of change, that is the differentiation of the amount of water in the tank with respect to time, so when the water level is high we have a high rate of change and when its low we have a low rate of change - we write this mathematically as dV/dt. Now, suppose we had a bucket under the hole and we collect the leaked water.  Obviously, the amount of water in the bucket will increase over time.  How would we estimate how much water is falling into the bucket over time?  Well, this isn\u2019t so easy. Let\u2019s say in the first second, there\u2019s a quart of water in the bucket, but that\u2019s not to say there will be two quarts in two seconds since the flow of water will be a little less in the second second of our experiment.  So we need to adjust the calculation with the rate of flow in the second second, and for the third second it will be a little less, and so on.  Now, our calculations are still not that accurate, the flow would be different in the first half of the first second and the second half of the first second, so we would have to adjust for that.  But, that same reasoning would be true for the first quarter, second quarter, etc.  Integration is a process where we can sum up these tiny contributions to the water accumulated in the bucket where the intervals between the summation are made smaller and smaller so we get closer to the true result. Combining the two ideas, if dV/dt is the rate of flow out of the leak, and V is the amount of water in the bucket after t seconds, V is the integral of dV/dt evaluated over [0,t]. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, integration and differentiation are two opposite polls. As we know differentiating something means making rhe difference clear. In mathematical perspective too, it is similar. Basically we differ the property of function in one point to other. More precisely, it gives rate of change of a function. Like, you have a function, Y=Y=(x2x2)/9+(8/9)/9+(8/9) So, it is very clear that the graph will be parabolic. We can see by plotting it too\u2026 it shows a curve like this\u2026  Well now differentiation gives the rate of change as told. As follows ..  Here we can see, the rate of change is also dependent on xx, so it means at different point on the function, rate of change will be different. P.s. the function dy/dxdy/dx is called as derivative and the process is known as differentiation. Imagine, a car on a one lane road. The position of the car with respect to a fixed point, we denote as x variable. So we know that x=f(t)x=f(t)that is x is a function of time, as with time, x changes. So if we differentiate x now, with respect to t, we get, the derivative function and by definition it is rate of change of position coordinate , by sense which is nothing else than the speed!!!. . . So basically this is differentiation. And integration is the exact opposite of this. In differentiation, we torn apart the function in infinitesimally small parts to get the tangent at a point and in integration we add up those infinitesimally small parts to get the original function. Suppose a car moves with constant speed 20 kmph. As we discussed earlier, speed is nothing but the rate of change of position. So, dx/dt=20dx/dt=20 Hence we can integrate to get,  Here c is the integrating constant, which implies to any intial position value if existed, before starting the journey. . . So this is the summary\u2026 Differentiation means to divide the function in infinitesimally small parts to get the rate of change of one variable with respect to the other or the tangent at a point. Integration means to add up the infinitesimally small parts of the function or the tangent locuses of the function from the rate of change to get the original function. .

            "answer_text": "Both are about splitting a function into arbitrarily small pieces and taking the limit. The derivative of a function, f(x)f(x), is the function that gives the rate of change at any point in a continuous function. Normally, to compute speed, we just take an average value. After all, speed is defined as distance over time. But what if we want the speed at a specific instant, not a time interval? What are we deviding by? We can't just divide by 00, so instead, we start dividing by smaller and smaller values of xx and we see what value f(x)f(x) is approaching. Formally, the derivative is defined as limx\u2192af(a)\u2212f(x)a\u2212x.limx\u2192af(a)\u2212f(x)a\u2212x. Basically, we have some point we want to know the speed at, say x=5x=5. What we do is take a really tiny interval that includes x=5x=5 and we divide by that. Then, we start making that interval smaller and smaller and see if the function is approaching a specific value. If it is (and it always will be, as long as the function is continuous and doesn't have any sharp points at the point we've chosen, such as x=0x=0 in the absolute value function) that value is the derivative of f(x)f(x) at that point. That shrinking interval can be thought as splitting the function up into arbitrarily tiny pieces and finding the slope between any two of them. While the derivative at a point is a number, the \u201cindefinite\u201d(for lack of a better term, I'm borrowing the one usually applied to integrals) derivative is a function, often denoted f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x), that gives the rate of change for any xx value of f(x)f(x). For example, the derivative of f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is 2x2x (you can prove that using the definition above, but how I got it doesn't really matter for the purposes of this answer). What that means that is every time xx increases by a factor of 1,f(x)1,f(x) increases by a factor of 2x2x. Evaluating it at a given point, say x=5,x=5, gives f\u2032(x)=10f\u2032(x)=10. So let's say that f(x)f(x) is describing the path I'm running on using units of meters and seconds. If the derivative at x=5x=5 is 10,10, that means that at exactly the moment I reach the 55 meter mark, I'll be running at exactly 5\u00d72=105\u00d72=10 meters per second. (In reality, the function properly wouldn't be a perfect model of my path, but that doesn't really matter if you're just trying to understand what a derivative is.). An integral, on the other hand, is the sum of those arbitrarily small pieces we split the function into when using the \u201cshrinking interval\u201d. You may wonder, \u201chow can you take the sum of arbitrarily many pieces or even split something into arbitrarily many pieces at all?\u201d Physically, you obviously can't, but the amazing thing about math is that, if you can imagine it, you can do it in the mathematical \u201cuniverse.\u201d Not everything in this \u201cuniverse\" is actually useful for real world applications, but integrals and derivatives are. Back to the point, what does it mean to add up arbitrarily many pieces and why do it at all? We do it because sometimes it's really hard to measure something directly. For example, it's really hard to get the exact area of a circle, but it's easy to get the area of a triangle. So, we imagine cutting the circle into lots of triangles and measuring each of those instead.  No matter how many we split it into, it's always an approximation because of the pieces above the triangle. But what if we just keep splitting it up into smaller and smaller pieces, letting them get arbitrarily small? As the number of pieces gets arbitrarily large, the margin of error gets arbitrarily small. Let's call the number of triangles n and the unaccounted for area xx. Formally, we say \u201cas nn approaches \u221e\u221e, xx approaches 00.\u201d The area of a circle is defined as the sum of all the triangle areas as n approaches \u221e\u221e. This is where the formula \u03c0r\u00b2\u03c0r\u00b2 comes from, though I won't go into the details here. This sum is what an integral is \u2014 the finite number that results from adding up many arbitrarily tiny pieces. What about derivatives? It makes sense that we might want to know an area, but why would we possibly need to know the value at such a tiny point? It all comes down to rate of change (speed). Speed is defined as distance over time, but what if the time is 00? How do you calculate the speed? We use the same concept of limits that I mentioned above, except, instead of nn approaching \u221e\u221e while xx approaches 0,0, nn approaches 00 while xx approaches some (hopefully finite) number. This number, assuming it exists and is finite (sometimes it doesn't, in which case the limit doesn't exist and there is no derivative) is the speed at that instant. That's the derivative. I hope this helped! Feel free to ask for clarification in the comments. ",

            "answer_text": "To put it simply, differentiation is the opposite of integration. Differentiation breaks down things, whereas integration adds them up. The name calculus, meaning small pebbles in Latin, is self-explanatory. Imagine you were back to the ancient times where these stones were a form of currency. When you paid, you would accumulate the stones to the priced quantity. The cashier then broke down the paid sum to count the stones. In a mathematical sense, you were integrating each stone to the required sum, while the cashier was differentiating the amount into each stone. Back to reality, you can contrast the two pillars of calculus in terms of the coordinate system, geometry and physics. On a coordinate plane, differentiation is to find the slope of a graph at a given point, whereas integration is to find the area or volume bounded by a curve and an axis, or between curves. From the perspective of geometry, differentiation is to bring a \u2018thing\u2019 down a dimension, whereas integrating the \u2018thing\u2019 brings it up a dimension. You may comprehend it by differentiating the volume of a sphere with respect to the points in it to get its total surface area. Integrating the total surface area over the points in it returns you the volume. As far as physics is concerned, differentiating a quantity A with respect to another quantity B yields the change of A over B. In case B is time, the result tells us the rate of change of A. Integrating the result over B gives us back A, referring to the cumulative sum of discrete individuals of a quantity over an interval of another quantity. Displacement, velocity and acceleration always come to my mind as the classical example whenever I relate calculus with physics. ",

When you\u2019re dividing very small quantities by very small quantities, there\u2019s no telling what the difference quotient will be, and the main tool for this analysis is the concept of limit. The archetypical example is computing instantaneous\u2014as opposed to average\u2014velocities, given position (along a track, say) as a function of time. Integration, on the other hand, is the process of adding up many small things, and may be viewed as a kind of averaging. A prime example of this is the problem of finding areas of irregular plane figures by dividing up those figures into finer and finer pieces and adding up the little areas. The main tool for this analysis is also the concept of limit. In a fairly deep sense, integration is the \u201copposite\u201d of differentiation, in analogy with how taking square roots is opposite to the process of squaring. The difference is that squaring inputs/outputs numbers, while differentiation inputs/outputs functions. Here\u2019s more information. Differential calculus - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I think both derivative and integral are based on\u201dGetting the exact value through approximation\u201d.That\u2019s if i cant find the exact value directly but i can approximate it and not only that i can also get better and better approximations. And if these approximations approach a certain unique value as they get more and more accurate that\u2019s as they become better and better, Surely this unique value is the exact value.That is what we do in derivative .You can\u2019t find the velocity at a certain instant directly ,but you can find the average velocity over an interval that contains this instant.The value of this average velocity can be taken to be approximately the velocity at that instant.If you choose a smaller interval that contains this instant and calculate the average velocity over it , you can take this value to be a better approximation for the velocity at this instant.You observe the more you shrink your interval,the better the approximation is.Why is this so?This is because when the interval is very small the velocity over this interval has no time to change ,thus the value of this average velocity would be a good approximation to the velocity of the object at this instant.Back again. If the approximations that we make for the instantaneous velocity get closer and closer to a specific unique value as they get more accurate, that\u2019s as they become better and better, surely this unique value is the value of the instantaneous velocity. You see \u201cwe get the exact value through approximations\u201d.This is the essence idea of derivative. In the case of integral,sometimes we can\u2019t calculate the area of arbitrary shapes that\u2019s because we don\u2019t have formulas to do that.But we can use our background knowledge to do that.For example we know how to find the area of a rectangle.We will use this to find the area of an arbitrary shape.What we do is that we divide the shape into many rectangles (vertical rectangles), then we calculate the area of each rectangle ,we know how to do that, and sum up all the areas.The resulting value would be a good approximation for the area of the shape.But we can make this approximation better and better that\u2019s more accurate.How do we do that?We do this by increasing the number of rectangles whose areas approach the area of the shape.Doing so we observe that the approximations get closer and closer to a specific unique value as they become more accurate that\u2019s as they get better and better.Surely this unique value is the exact area of the shape.You see \u201c we get the exact value again through approximations\u201d.This is the essence idea of integral.

            "answer_text": "Differentiation Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function. So if you\u2019re asked to differentiate f(x) = x^n then f\u2019(x)= n x^(n-1). At a point M(a,b), the derivative is actually called the gradient of the curve at that point which is the same as the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point. Using the definition to find the derivative at M: f\u2032(a)=f\u2032(a)= limx\u2192a[f(x)\u2212f(a)/(x\u2212a)]limx\u2192a[f(x)\u2212f(a)/(x\u2212a)] Note that if the limit doesn\u2019t exist it means that the function is not differentiable at M. The derivative test the change in y if x changes a little bit, so it\u2019s very important in studying rates (like velocities and accelerations in physics or rates of chemical reactions in chemistry or optimization of profit and cost in economics \u2026). Integration According to the fundemental theorem of Calculus the integral of the derivative between abcissas a and b is equal to f(b)-f(a). \u222ba\u2192bf\u2032(x)dx=f(b)\u2212f(a)\u222ba\u2192bf\u2032(x)dx=f(b)\u2212f(a) Interesting right? So, as if we\u2019re saying integration is the opposite process of differentiation. Actually, if you have the derivative of a function f\u2019(x) and a point that belongs to the curve of the function f, then you can find f(x) easily. You need a point to find the constant of integration which is obtained when you find an indefinite integral (i.e integral without bounds). For example \u222bx dx= x^2/2 + C so we actually have infinite solution where C can take any real value, but if we\u2019re given a point (0,0) that belongs to the curve we get a unique solution which is in this case x^2/2 (C=0). Integration has a lot of application, like finding areas under curves or between them to finding average values of functions in engineering and a lot more. ",

            "answer_text": "You can think of differential calculus as the calculus that deals with rates of change, and you can think of integral calculus as the calculus that deals with accumulation functions. You can also think of these two branches as being inverses of each other. Therefore, you can think of integration as anti-differentiation. For example, given the quadratic function f(x)=2x^2 + 3x + 4, its derivative is the linear function g(x)=4x + 3, and if given the linear function g(x)=4x + 3, it's anti-derivative or integral is the quadratic function f(x)=2x^2 + 3x + c. Some common theorems or topics covered in differential calculus are: a) Rolle's Theorem, b) Mean Value Theorem, c) Intermediate value theorem, d) Concavity and points of inflection, e) Newton's method for finding roots, f) Optimization, g) Average rate of change, h) Instantaneous rate of change, i) L'Hopital's rule for limits, j) chain rule for derivatives, k) implicit differentiation, etc. Some common theorems or topics covered in integral calculus are: a) The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, b) Volumes of solids of revolution, c) Volumes of solids by cross-sections, d) Area under the curve, e) Area between curves, f) Surface area of a solid, g) Particle displacement, etc. I hope this helps you.

            "answer_text": "The difference between a derivative and an integral is that they are inverse functions; an integral is an antiderivative. This is the fundamental theorem of calculus.[1] If f(t) is a function describing a position at a time t, then f'(t) describes velocity, and f''(t)) describes acceleration. You can integrate f''((t)) to get f'(t), and integrate f\u2019(t) to get f(t). So a spy program in your smartphone knowing an initial position and having access to a clock and accelerometer can determine your subsequent position. A contrasting method to those presented is that is demonstrated (at least in some cases) that one can integrate by differentiating (and vice-versa) that there is not such a basic difference between the two operations as one may have experienced in practice from standard calculus exercises. In the last part of A NEW CLASS OF GENERALIZED LANCZOS DERIVATIVES, by Gin\u00e9s R. P\u00e9rez Teruel, is discussed a mechanism related to the Lanzcos method, namely, integration by differentiation. See also How to (Path-) Integrate by Differentiating by Achim Kempf, David M. Jackson, Alejandro H. Morales. I read about this from Lanczos, but I hear that Feynmann used a similar (same?) technique.

            "answer_text": "Differential calculus focuses on the derivative operation. The derivative is the rate at which a function changes ( for example, speed is the rate at which position changes with time, so speed is the derivative of position with respect to time), and the slope of the tangent line to a curve at any point.  Integration is essentially a summation process which is used most basically to find the area enclosed by curves.  Both use the principle that curved objects can be approximated by straight objects if we allow for a small enough interval. We then use the notion of a limit to make our intervals infinitesimally small and allow our approximations to become exact.  Differentiation and integration are intimately related by an extremely powerful rule called The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus which states that the integral of the derivative of a function can be calculated as the difference of the values of the function at it's end points.

Integration is a term used in calculus to refer to the formula and the procedure of calculating the area under the curve. It is worth noting that the graph must be under a curve, which results to the formation of an integral part, which is difficult to find the area unlike other shapes like circles, squares, and rectangles, which are easier to calculate their areas.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty much the opposite actually. To differentiate a function usually means to take the derivative. That is the rate of change of the function. For example, d(x2)dx=2xd(x2)dx=2x, meaning that the derivative of x2x2 is 2x2x. On the other hand, integration is the reverse. It finds the area under a curve. There are two kinds of integrals, indefinite integrals and definite integrals. Indefinite integrals are also known as antiderivatives, so you can probably guess what they do. If f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x) is the derivative of f(x)f(x), then f(x)f(x) is an indefinite integral of f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x). But multiple functions can have the same derivative. For example, the derivative of x2x2 is 2x2x, but the derivative of x2+1x2+1 is also 2x2x. You can add any constant to the end and not change the derivative. So the indefinite integral of f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x), written \u222bf\u2032(x)dx\u222bf\u2032(x)dx, is f(x)+Cf(x)+C. Definite integrals don\u2019t give back a function, they give back a number. \u222bbaf\u2032(x)dx\u222babf\u2032(x)dx represents the area under the curve of f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x) from aa to bb. It is equal to F(b)\u2212F(a)F(b)\u2212F(a), where F(x)F(x) is the indefinite integral of f\u2032(x)f\u2032(x). If we substitute in f(x)+Cf(x)+C for F(x)F(x), we get f(b)+C\u2212(f(a)+C)f(b)+C\u2212(f(a)+C). The CC cancels out and you\u2019re left with f(b)\u2212f(a)f(b)\u2212f(a), which is just a number as long as aa and bb are numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Well to start off (there\u2019s a lot of them, actually), we can say that they are \u2018inverses\u2019 or they undo each other. This is what the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus revolves around and it gives us an opportunity to evaluate Definite Integrals. Let\u2019s get an example:F(x)=ddx[\u222b7\u03c0x\u03c011x2\u221a5sin(cos(x))]=11x2\u221a5sin(cos(x))F(x)=ddx[\u222b\u03c07\u03c0x11x25sin(cos(x))]=11x25sin(cos(x)) See how elegant that is? That\u2019s one of the most basic differences. 2. For a second one, which we just get from the basic definition of them is, the definition of the derivative is: ddx[f(x)]=limh\u21920f(x+h)\u2212f(x)hddx[f(x)]=limh\u21920f(x+h)\u2212f(x)h And the definition of an integral (definite) is: \u222bbaf(x)dx=limn\u2192\u221e\u2211ni=1f(xi)\u0394x\u222babf(x)dx=limn\u2192\u221e\u2211i=1nf(xi)\u0394x 3. The derivative is used to approximate the slope of a line as it closer and closer to a tangent line (meaning that the slope of a line that passes through 1 and only 1 point in the graph). The integral is used to approximate the area under the curve of a function by splitting it into smaller parts, or using integration rules. AND MANY MORE! ",

            "answer_text": "Differentiation is taking the limit is delta x goes to zero of (delta x)/(delta y) and finding the tangent line to the curve at that point. Integration is finding an area of a curve, between the curve and the x axis, from one point a to another point b. This is done by dividing that area into an infinite number of delta x\u2019es, so that when you take the sum of the products of the delta x\u2019es and each successive value of y or f(x + delta x), and take the sum of all of them, you have an exact measurement of the area. The derivative of curve at a point is its slope. The integral of a function over a length of the curve is the area of the space below the curve. The integral of a slope is the value of the function. They are related and are inverse functions involving rates of change and sequences and series. ",

            "answer_text": "In simple terms, differentiation is the act of finding the rate of change of the gradient/slope of any function while integration is the area under the curve of function with respect to the x axis. Repeated differentiation can also be determined if a point is a local maximum or minimum of a function and be used in equations to help explain the motion of objects. Integration, or anti-differentiation, can also be utilised to find the length of a line on a graph, also referred to as a path of a function, the surface area of 3-dimensional graph functions and also volumes of 3-dimensional graph functions. Simply put, differentiation is used to find the rates of change of things, and integration is used to measure lengths, areas and volumes. ",

Sometimes you will see the symbol dx in either one of them. This is a fossilised remnant of the symbol \\delta x, meaning a small change in x. When you take a first course in calculus, you will probably first. meet the idea of differentiation, and later meet the idea of integration. It is often said that they are inverse processes. This is a very poor description of one mathematical result, often called \u201ca (or the) fundamental theorem of calculus\u201d, which says that the derivative of the integral of a function of x is the function itself. This is true for the simplest functions you will meet in a first course. ",

Aside from this general insight, we could settle on them both being operations on functions. We put a function into any one of those and get back another function. Differentiation is about rate of change. Integration is about area. They are related by the fundamental theorem. Small changes in area reflect steepness of the area function. ",

While differentiation helps you find derivatives of functions and examine, if the functions are continuous and differentiable at particular points, if they have a saddle point, integration helps you find the summation of a function over a defined region and helps you find the area covered below the curve, common area to the two curves, if the curve exists within certain limts, or the area occupied in that definite limit. Differentiation followed by integration or vice versa, applied on a function results in getting back the function itself. The answer will be identity. ",
