            "answer_text": "Reading this question made me pretty mad at first, but then I realised how real this issue truly is. This is not a troll question. It needs to be addressed.  My father has never made a cup of tea for my mother, in his life-time. It's not that he can't be bothered, it's because his parents taught him different. Growing up in a traditional, South Asian household, my father was told to be the hard working man. He was told that his wife would feed him, 'obey' him and that his only duty was to provide for his family. My mother was told that her duty was to be a housewife and follow her husband's every command. Doing this would keep him happy. I'm thankful that my dad isn't abusive of any kind, but the power that was given to him is beyond disgusting. The power that some men are given in my culture makes me sick.  That was and still is, the mentality of the elder generation in my culture. Now here's the issue. I am the new generation. On one hand, my parents are teaching me the traditional route. On the other hand, I am educated and know better.  YES. The answer is YES. You can and WILL make tea for your wife. I do not care if your parents tell you any different. What happens between you and your wife, stays between you and your wife. She is not your slave. She is not your maid. She is your other half. You treat her, just as you want to be treated. She is your wife. She is your love. She is your everything. Cook for her, massage her, buy her gifts, cuddle her. Just be a freaking husband.  Image Source: Sehere & Moin ",

I, as a male am telling you the truth about the lives of men and this is the final step of being an official man. The day your hands vanish is the day you are officially a man! Congrats.  Well I was being sarcastic. I can't speak for all men but my mum has always and still always encourage me to help my wife and be supportive. She taught me basic skills. Such as washing dishes, warming up things and etc. I used to ask why and she said it was for my marriage and for my wife. My dad also helps my mum out so my mum often tells me to follow my dad's footsteps in this matter. Actually I often joke with my mum saying, \u201cMaa you teach me how to wash dishes, help out in the house but why won't you help me find a wife?\u201d :P. I can warm up food, cook some dishes (mainly kebabs and tikka) and I can make mint green tea. I often do it for guests but I sometimes do it for myself and my family. I will tell you one thing. My beloved (whenever I get one) would be a full time companion, a full time lover, a full time friend but she will not be a full time maid. I would help her and sometimes will cook for her InshaAllah. I can't wait for the day her eyes will sparkle when she sees my kahwah (green tea) and food made from my magical hands. ",

Women had no say in politics , religion , wars and basically anything which would have made them feel as if they are a part of society. Like oxygen in air , they were necessary for our species but their existence was unappreciated. Time went and modern human understood the importance of women. Not in a conventional way , but they were now considered as an object. A woman was possessed by her man. More beautiful the woman , higher is the standing of her man in society. Beauty was all which was there a woman had to crave for. Hundred of methods were evolved to enhance physical beauty. Poets used to write poems describing the beauty of a woman and the valor of a man. Slowly , our thinking changed. We progressed from war mongrers to apostles of peace. We condemned gender discrimination and encouraged equality. We made strict laws to curb domestic violence , rapes , dowry , acid attacks and what not. Why ? Just so that women can be treated as another human being. Not a child bearing womb , neither a beautiful trophy. Time webt by . And today is 27 September 2018. What are you asking ? Can a husband make tea for his wife ? Shouldn't you ask \u201c Should he make a sandwich also along with tea ?\u201d ",

Growing up, both my parents devoured tea and especially my father. My mother made tea everyday as a routine 4\u20135 times a day. She got slightly sick and she took an off from cooking a couple years back. Soon after that, my father cooked tea from himself and my mother. He didn\u2019t once tell her or us (children) to make tea instead he did it by himself. Which is quite shocking because he never made tea. The tea burned and fell a couple times but he finally learned it and now they both make tea and whenever my father does, he always asks my mother whether she wants to drink or not. He often says, \u2018Apne ma se pooch chai to nae peene?\u2019 Ask your mom whether she wants to drink tea or not. Which is extremely cute! Not only that, if needed, my father makes tea for the entire family and he cooks as well because my mother is lazy ;) It isn\u2019t about how one grew up. My father grew up in a high-class family and I\u2019m sure he never made tea in his life. It\u2019s actually about the person itself. If your husband is arrogant and manly type with the thought of you my wife, you cook then he isn\u2019t the type of man who\u2019ll make tea. ",

Women were created for the divine purpose of making tea. God does not want food to be tainted by the impure hands of a man. Seriously, what is this? The middle ages? If you have functional hands and feet, walk to the kitchen, make a cup for yourself and one for your wife. I understand the culture you are coming from but unless you live in some super rural and conservative part of the country, no one should even bat an eye. Hope you have not been stopped from learning how to make tea. Even if you are, it is not too late. ",
