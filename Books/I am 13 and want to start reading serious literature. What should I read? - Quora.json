            "answer_text": "What kind of books do you enjoy reading? There are many great works of literature - more than you can read in your lifetime. :-) Start by reading the ones you\u2019ll enjoy. You may want to read the great classics, or you may want to focus on more recent books (e.g. Pulitzer-_Prize winners). You can read fiction (novels, short stories) or you can read non-fiction (memoirs, accounts of true events). You may like creepy ghost stories, horror, poetry, humour, romance, suspense\u2026. I could suggest my favourite classics, but they may not be to your taste at all. If you\u2019re unsure about your own tastes, download the free sample pages of many ebooks (classics, and other books considered great literature) from Amazon or wherever you have an account. Read the first few pages of several. You\u2019ll quickly know whether a book pulls you in or not. Or, if you live in a town with a library, visit the library, and read the first few pages of several serious literature books there, then borrow the ones that grab you. If you\u2019re interested in classics, you can find many complete books free online (for example, through Project Gutenberg). Another strategy worth considering, especially if you want to get a broad education in literature fast, is to read short stories rather than novels. For example, you can read famous short stories by classic authors like Charles Dickens, Amelia Edwards, Edgar Allan Poe (you\u2019ll find them free online). Then move to short stories by authors of the 20th century (those will mostly not be free though). You can read a lot of great literature short stories in one year. At the end of the year, you\u2019ll have learned a lot about literature, and you\u2019ll know your own tastes. Then you can seek out novels in the style and by the authors you like. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read the seven answers so far, and they all have good suggestions about what books to read. If you are really drawn to reading, I do have a couple of notes on the matter, just from my own perspective, which may or may not suit you but have served me well. First, if you have any libraries or used book stores (I don\u2019t really recommend new book stores unless you know exactly what you seek), start to frequent them. Oddly, often books will just sort of jump out for you, seem more interesting than everything around. That\u2019s always helpful. Once you\u2019ve done that and read the book through a couple of times, you sort of get the hang of it and let your gut lead. Also, as people mention books to you, it really doesn\u2019t hurt to keep a little list; then, whenever you\u2019re needing a new suggestion, a change of pace, you can refer to your list for something which will take you on a different course. A couple of other things I\u2019ll mention - Don\u2019t bother with \u201ccondensed\u201d or modernized versions. Try reading hard copies (I\u2019m including paperback here) instead of e-books if they\u2019re available. I\u2019ve personally found that I do get more from reading actual books. There\u2019s something about an e-reader, at least for me, that precludes reading denser (and usually more fulfilling) material. Make a note of authors you really enjoy and seek out their other works. One more thing: people mentioned looking at Pulitzer and Nobel winners (great idea), and I am compelled to add that I always give the Booker Mann winners close attention and have never been disappointed. Very good luck to you. Books have quite literally changed my life for the better, and I wish you an extraordinary voyage as well. = ",
