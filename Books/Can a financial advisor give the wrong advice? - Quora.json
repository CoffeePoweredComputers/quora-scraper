            "answer_text": "Yes. Even an advisor who\u2019s been in the business for decades can steer you in the wrong direction. It\u2019s especially damaging to people who are about to consider retiring and making the huge life decision to stop working and bringing in income. You need the best advice and guidance of your life. There\u2019s a TV commercial that hammers the message \u201cjust okay is not good enough\u201d. I promise you, just \u2018ok\u2019 financial advice is not good enough. It would be like getting the wrong GPS directions on a very long road trip and then 3/4 of the way, you realize it\u2019s the wrong route and your thousands of miles from your desired destination. Maybe you are in the drivers seat and playing the role of navigator. It\u2019s smart to have that knowhow. But you can really benefit by having a second pair of eyes or an advisor who can demonstrate he/she has the skills to collaborate. An excellent advisor who specializes in retirement income strategies and tax planning can help ensure your decisions are solid. Just to have a very learned advisor to argue with can be incredibly valuable. The best possible advice I can give you is please take your time when you decide to find an advisor. An advisor must truly be competent, follow fiduciary best practices and work only and directly for you. Not for some brokerage firm or insurance company as an annuity salesman. This is a critically important life decision that requires critical thinking. Unfortunately too many people don\u2019t know how to find the right advisor or how to use a truly qualified advisor to enrich their lives and at the same time, reduce financial stress. The right advisor is not transaction-based but is a valuable relationship that can span decades. Imagine that 95% of all financial advisors are \u2018just okay and only 5% as exceptional. Don\u2019t settle. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Since he is a human being and his knowledge can not be ultimate. Sometimes seen, Consultants & Advisors have expertise in Stock/Shares and not that much good in Mutual Funds. In that case many-a-times his suggestion is to sell or buy the mutual funds like trading in stocks as per market volatility. Whereas Mutual Funds per se is a investment product not fit for trading, unlike stocks, where two strategies Trading & Investment both are there. There are further options in trading also like Intraday trading, Swing trading & Positional trading. You won't find any candle stick charts for mutual funds like available for stocks. On the other hand, if I am a novice investor in mutual funds, then advisor very good in stocks and average in mutual funds may be sufficient for me. Like, for treatment of fever etc., we dont go to professor of medicine of a medical college or no. 1 doctor in a big hospital, a average good doctor can treat us. Anyways, self learning to certain level is also necessary to choose a advisor for you and later to understand that his advice looks correct by and large. If you are a very big investor then perhaps you may require a expert consultant or advisor of mutual funds and you may like to have second opinion also with some other adviosor. Like people take second opinion of other doctor also if it is a major decease. ",

They can give wrong advice: Out of ignorance, or lack of knowledgeBy not listening and assuming one answer when client meant anotherIf the client gives bad background infoIf the advisor is motivated more by what\u2019s best for compensation vs best for the clientand many more reasons\u2026",

            "answer_text": "Yes, willingly or not. Advisors are humans and are prone to the biases found in the behavioral finance litterature. Some advisors have limited knowledge of markets or have not been around long enough and may underestimate risks by relying too much on models. Some advisors are just bad apples: They are willingly misleading investors for personnal gains in conflict of interest or fraud. That\u2019s why at minima you should only give your business to a registered financial advisor who will be insured, have received minimal training and should have a clean record. It doesn\u2019t guarantee however that the advice will be good. That\u2019s a completely different story. ",

            "answer_text": "The Financial adviser may give advise, which may benefit a sector , company, as his opinion could be there for scope for the sector or industry.If the company/sector makes profits, paying dividends also, market response could be different. The moves in market are unpredictable, hence mutual funds carry a condition, investment subject to market risk.Another common caution is that previous year/s performance does not guarantee continued returns or increased share value. The investment by FII may influence value of the shares.We often see in financial news that investors lost value to the time of Rs.2 lakh crore, when market is down by about 800 points (Sensex). This fall affects different sectors favourably or unfavourable (shares gaining, shares losing ).The common failure of overseas markets in 2,3 days continuously also affects our market, either increase in rates or decrease in rates. When fall is steep all shares are affected, mostly without benefiting any industry.The market revival from fall or increase in rates may be quick sometimes, which depends upon correct estimate of financial adviser. The investor investment increases , if his prediction or increase in rates matches day\u2019s results.",
