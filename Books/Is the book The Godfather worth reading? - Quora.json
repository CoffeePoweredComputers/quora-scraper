            "answer_text": "Unlike most people (including, by my entirely unscientific count, most of the other answers to this question), I read Mario Puzo\u2019s The Godfather long before I saw any of the films. I think this set me up for one of my more unpopular opinions: that not only is Puzo\u2019s book crap, but so are the films. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong: from a craft aspect, the Godfather films are amazing. The lighting, the sound, the scene-dressing, the costumes \u2014 all award-worthy. Oh, and the music\u2026 [chef\u2019s kiss]! That being said, a beautifully-shot piece of schlock is still schlock, and the script of The Godfather is irredeemable pulpy schlock.  What the movie thinks it\u2019s doing is exploring the ideas of \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cloyalty\u201d, with a little bit of \u201cfamily\u201d thrown in. What it actually does, unintentionally I\u2019m pretty sure, is lay bare the hollowness of \u201cmanliness\u201d as a guiding principle to live by, in that each character motivated by their many status as head of a family ends up hurting that family most of all (except the metaphorical family, the crime family, the business). Or, as one character in a very different (but yet not unrelated) film would have it:   Now, this question is about the book, not the film(s), so I won\u2019t go on to critique the writing (or the acting \u2014 oh, God, the terrible acting) further. And, well, whatever redeeming features the films have are not present in the book. The book may be the platonic ideal of pulp \u2014 lurid, shameless, swinging wildly from plotline to plotline. The characters are archetypes; the men deal out violence at the slightest provocation (or none at all), the women are either window dressing or sex toys. This is a book in which a significant plot element revolves around a major character\u2019s gigantic dick. Unironically. Final answer: no, there are basically infinitely many more worthwhile uses for your time than either the book or film versions of The Godfather. ",

            "answer_text": "I've read through the other answers and quite frankly I'm shocked\u2026 Seriously utterly shocked. It is absolutely astonishing that a lot of upvotes go just towards Sonny's penis. While comedic, remarkable, and attention grabbing, in no way does it answer the question. The book itself is actually more like a manual on \u201chow to build your own mafia.\u201d From humble beginnings of an origin story from rags to riches to the most detailed plans of what to do in a mafia war, the book educates and guides the reader on the Italian mafia. It takes you on a multigenerational storyline of how the mafia is formed from its roots, to how tragically it ends. This is THE BOOK on mafia. It is not surprising that the movie became a huge hit, because the material is highly extensive and engaging. Credit must be given to Francis Coppola, it is visually stunning. Absolutely phenomenal. Directed beautifully with the most subtle nuances exhibited perfectly. Without question, IMDB ranks it top ten most gorgeous movies of all time. The acting created careers and made world famous A listers. The first Godfather and the second godfather were absolute cinematic masterpieces. The third\u2026 ehhh. Back to the book, with the grand success of the film's, the book is overshadowed as a medium and gets almost none of the credit that it deserves. The book itself, is a masterpiece. Intricate and stunning, any fan of the godfather must read it, in order to truly and fully appreciate the movie. The details in the first chapter alone, provide the subtle behind the scenes dynamics for the film. It is detailed, to the point where re-reading it is an educational experience filled with old fashioned Italian mafia wisdom. The book and movie are equal. The question comes down to not IF but WHEN you will read it. I personally recommend reading the book before watching the movie, it provides a deeper insight into the context. Although I do warn you, you might just get through it in one sitting, perhaps two, because it is a page flipper on its own and very hard to put down after the third chapter. It is truly a remarkable tale, and MUST read. The movie without the book, is an incomplete journey into a beautiful masterpiece of truly epic proportions.  You can look at this beautiful scene and appreciate it, but ONLY by reading the book will you truly have a deep, profound, and intimate understanding of what it means to \u201cmake someone an offer they cannot refuse.\" ",
