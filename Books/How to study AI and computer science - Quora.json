            "answer_text": "The most important factor is having multiple internships at Google. While Google itself does not have a great conversion ratio, having Google on your resume/LinkedIn is a huge boon. You will probably regularly have recruiters reaching out to you. I believe IBM has a better conversion ratio but is also less prestigious. I know at Cisco about 85\u201390% of interns get full-time offers, so I am assuming IBM is roughly the same. (We are both giant tech companies whose heyday was in the 20th century.) Next, it depends on what you mean by study at MIT. I could go sit in on a class with a friend at MIT tomorrow if I wanted to. (Technically not anymore because I\u2019m in Toronto rn and MIT is closed because of COVID-19.) If you mean instead receiving your undergraduate/graduate degree from MIT, then it definitely helps. This will guarantee a safe well-paying job, but you will still need to work hard for something like a job at a FAANG. I go to UofT which is a bit less prestigious than MIT for comp sci. I\u2019m also not an amazing student (I had under a 3.0 last year, it\u2019s better now). This said I had the same internship last summer as a student at MIT who was a year older than me. There was another MIT student who was also a year older than me working on a different (less prestigious) team at the company. I personally don\u2019t know much about the Intel International Science/Engineering Fair. I am assuming it will help much more with getting into college than getting a job. For example, Schneider Electric (where I work last summer) host a contest called \u201cGo Green in the City\u201d. It had 24,000 entries so it is a fairly large contest. The grand prize is a trip to visit a couple of offices, getting to present at a big conference, and a job offer. If your goal is a job offer, it would be much easier to just get an internship and do your job well. I have no idea what Research Science Institute is. I\u2019m assuming it is some tech focus high school in your country. Again while this might help a bit for applying to colleges, it probably won\u2019t affect getting a job offer. In general, once you are in college high school achievements shouldn\u2019t be impressive. As an adult, you have the ability to do so much more, so if you haven\u2019t it looks bad. I no longer list my high school on my resume and after this summer I will remove all my high school experience as well. I\u2019m assuming you are a high schooler right now, if not in middle school. I wish you luck in the future. It is great that you are already thinking about your career. While your list of goals will set you up for success, don\u2019t be discourage if you fail at some of them. You can always start somewhere else an move your way up in your career. For example, in the past 3 years, I went from being a Lab Intern at a local factory to a Software Engineering Intern at Cisco.
