            "answer_text": "It would have likely caused Harry\u2019s PTSD to become worse, potentially altering some minor bits of the story. Harry would also most likely be wracked with guilt, as he could have stopped it. The Ministry of Magic would have likely tried to charge him with essential murder for not stopping it, but would probably not be able to convict him. Harry would have probably been kicked out of the Dursley\u2019s, and wouldn\u2019t have had the protection from Voldemort. Otherwise, it may have not altered the story too terribly much. ",

They would either kick him out of the house or treat him even more horribly. The rest of the story would probably be about the same, since Dudley doesn\u2019t play that big of a role in the story, but Harry would have regretted not saving him. -Chloe ",
