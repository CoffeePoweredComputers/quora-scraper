Historically, there is no evidence of anyone who followed God, and then began horrible child abuse practices (death, sexual\u2026.) of reprenting. Many Nazi officers claimed Christianity, yet refused to repent of Holocaust atrocities. Many were caught and their last words \u201cI look forward to standing before the judgement Throne of God\u201d. The Japanese still have not apologized or acknowledge the rape of Nanking (bayoneting babies for sport). Or Unit 731. \u201c if anyone causes one of these little ones to stumble; it would be better if they had never been born\u201d Jesus Christ 32AD Solomon is probably in Hell with The Demon Molech as I write this, along with an entire army of Japanese and Nazi officers.

            "answer_text": "There are mysteries that shroud the great King Solomon for sure. Not only was he a known magician, he also had his Flying Carpet which he would use to traverse great distances. In one instance it is said he was in two different places, four hundred miles apart\u2026Wait for it\u2026On the same day! To find resources on exactly how the King summoned demons is practically impossible but I can refer you to this information; Search out information related to; The Lesser Key of Solomon, or the Goetia.
