And many agents and publishers don\u2019t want to work with self published authors. Actually if you do your homework and market your book you\u2019ll make more money selling it yourself and have an agent. ",

I think the series way is the most likely way to be signed into a publisher as a self-published person. If a self-published is successful for the first installation, it\u2019s likely readers will want to buy the next in the series. ",
