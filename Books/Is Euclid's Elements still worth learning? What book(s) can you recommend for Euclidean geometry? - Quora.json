            "answer_text": "Do you have the time to devote to a serious study of plane geometry? In spite of it often being called \"elementary\", it's not very elementary. Something that we all know, like the Pythagorean theorem, is not easy to prove rigorously. Yes, we've all seen various cut and paste proofs of it, but how rigorous are they, really? For example, they all rely on the existence of squares, but how do you prove that squares exist? Euclid knew the answer to that. Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 46, the proposition preceding his proof of the Pythagorean theorem:   Look at all the things that went into proving it. I.Post.4 is the fourth postulate, that all right angles are equal. Euclid based his geometry on axioms (i.e. postulates and common notions). The axioms were explicitly stated assumptions. For the most part, they can be easily stated, but one of them, the parallel postulate, I.Post.5, has a fairly complicated statement. It's actually used in this proposition, not directly, but indirectly though proposition I.34. The Pythagorean theorem is false if the parallel postulate doesn't hold. Unless you've studied mathematics based on an axiomatic theory (like Euclid's, or  number theory based on the Dedekind-Peano axioms, or set theory based on Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms) you haven't seen real mathematics.  All that arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and calculus you've studied for years and years is not real mathematics until every statement is proved, and that requires axioms, definitions, and theorems with proof. One way you can learn some real mathematics is by studying Euclid's Elements. The first book will show you a lot. It ends with the Pythagorean theorem and its converse. (The converse states that for a triangle if [math]c^2=a^2+b^2[/math], then the triangle is a right triangle with hypotenuse [math]c[/math].)  You'll also see flaws in Euclid's presentation. There are several places where he makes conclusions without justification. Recognizing flaws is important, too. Euclid's presentation wasn't improved until about 1900 when mathematicians fixed those flaws. See Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry for more on that. Yes, Euclid's Elements is still worth studying. Your second question, what books can you recommend for Euclidean geometry, depends on what you mean by Euclidean geometry.  If you mean Euclidean geometry the way Euclid did it, then his Elements is the best text.  The problem with most modern textbooks is that they use coordinates or otherwise build on assumed properties of real numbers. Since they usually don't prove anything about he real numbers, that means the exposition is not self-contained.  Look for textbooks that don't use coordinates or real numbers, but build from stated axioms of geometry. ",

            "answer_text": " Sure for me it was good as i wanted to learn something new and i had time to devote for it and i recommend you also to have a look because more knowledge you have the better you are. According to me the best book on Euclidean geometry is written by David M. Clark. Mathematically, Clark has chosen a new set of axioms that draw on a modern understanding of set theory and logic, the real number continuum and measure theory, none of which were available in Euclid's time. Euclidean Geometry: A Guided Inquiry Approach Traditionally, we have also learned formal reasoning by studying Euclidean geometry. In this book, David Clark develops a modern axiomatic approach to this ancient subject, both in content and presentation. The result is a development of the standard content of Euclidean geometry with the mathematical precision of Hilbert's foundations of geometry. In particular, the book covers all the topics listed in the Common Core State Standards for high school synthetic geometry. The presentation uses a guided inquiry, active learning pedagogy. Students benefit from the axiomatic development because they themselves solve the problems and prove the theorems with the instructor serving as a guide and mentor. Students are thereby empowered with the knowledge that they can solve problems on their own without reference to authority. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession. This book, written for axiomatic geometry course, is particularly well suited for future secondary school teachers. ",
