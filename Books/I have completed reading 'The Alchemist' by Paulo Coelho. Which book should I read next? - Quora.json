            "answer_text": "I would suggest Shoe Dog by Phil Knight, co-founder of one of the most valuable sports brand in the world Nike. In this book, Phil Knight describes his personal journey and the humble beginnings of Nike. What makes this book special? In the Alchemist, the story revolves around Santiago, a shepherd who has a dream and undertakes a journey to the Egyptian Pyramids to find a treasure. Phil Knight's story is strikingly similar to Santiago. He is an accountant in Oregorn who has a dream(a crazy idea) which takes him on a world trip at the young age of 25 and changes his life forever . Phil Knight's story describes all the challenges both circumstantial and pshychological that signifies the importance of courage and persistence. As you have read the Alchemist , you can now get to know the real life alchemy that transforms the life of a young man who becomes a billionaire much like the treasure in the Egyptian Pyramids. This book is a wonderful combination of how reaction to small challenges compound to completely separate a helpless man from a successful and wise person. I think that this book will help you figure out how real life miracles happen and the message of The Alchemist will become clear to you. ",
