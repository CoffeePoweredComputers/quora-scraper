            "answer_text": "I\u2019m talking about that light up the room, do anything for that person, change your life type love. I used to be a doubter. I used to think that love in the traditional sense did not exist. I used to think that it was a marketing strategy that was pushed by the movie industry and big business fat cats to sell people on buying more gifts and spending more money. That sounds ridiculous, right? I still believe there is some truth to the last one, but hey, why wouldn\u2019t you profit off of it? We all have to make money and you might as well do it over everyone's favourite gushy and warm feeling - I digress. \u2026then I met my partner. She was the most amazing human being I had ever encountered. As feminine as a flower and to me the most beautiful woman alive - she kind of looks like a cat. She taught me many things. About myself and about what it means to love another human being unconditionally, she stirred all of this in me just by being herself. These are some of the things that she taught me; The first sign of true love is comfort, which allows you to be your full self. From the moment we started talking and that first hello was uttered, I felt immediately comfortable, as comfortable as I feel when I\u2019m by myself. I realised that I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be something that I was not, I didn\u2019t have to put on a show and hide the person that lives inside my body, I could talk from the heart with complete freedom and she would genuinely feel it too and feed it back to me. Until you are ready to give love, you will not receive it. So many people that I have encountered complain about not being able to find love, or that everyone out there is f#%ked! The truth remains that whenever something that we desire, be it money, or love, is not finding its way to us, we must look at ourselves, not the outside world. What are WE doing to stop this from coming into our lives? I had a few relationships before I met my partner and a lot of experiences where I was fortunate enough to meet a heap of people and yet, I could never find somebody that was even remotely close to anyone I could see myself with. Was this because of who they were? No. It was because I didn\u2019t have the emotional capacity to care that much about somebody else while being too preoccupied about myself all of the time -this is not a bad thing, you need to discover more of who you are before you can give something to somebody which you do not yet possess. I learnt that love will find its way to you when you are ready to give it. True love is a gift. It is liberation, not condemnation. I am somebody who highly values freedom, sometimes to a fault. I have been scared of commitment in the past because I felt that it would cut away my ability to maneuver, to be able to change if I didn\u2019t like that which I was committing to, which ironically also doesn\u2019t allow you to commit long enough to receive the rewards of said commitment. But that all flew out of the window when I met her, I wanted to be around her all the time, I felt free while not being alone- It was strange and beautiful at the same time. I gained a partner in every sense of the word. A playmate, a business partner, somebody to be there with you in the darkest times, somebody to share the joys of your greatest achievements and we both became each others teacher and student. You want to become better, you want to be an example. When I met my partner, she already had an 8-year-old daughter and even though I realised that I couldn\u2019t mess around and be irresponsible like I had previously, this line of thought alone wasn\u2019t powerful enough to make me change and become more responsible. Instead, it seemed like a magical force pushed me to exceed my previous limiting perceptions about love and all of the other things that stopped me from chasing my dreams and creating the life I desired. I wanted to become better not just for myself, but for all of us. That magical force was the love for her and her daughter. You become more selfless, you support each other's dreams full heartedly. I learnt that in true love, you gain your biggest supporter and your biggest fan. We all want to succeed in what we choose to do, whether it is in business, art, love, or even the tiny little things that we do on a day to day basis. Whether we want to admit it or not, some of the largest self-motivators are achievement and success directed towards ourselves - and there is nothing wrong with that. However, I learnt that in true love, you want the other person to succeed as much as you want yourself to succeed, and that can only be true if you feel the other person as if they are the other half of you, the opposite exact mirror. That is where the love originates from and it is the reason that we must always be kind and loving towards the other, because if you harm them, you are only ever harming yourself. But if you love them with everything that you have and support them, it will come back to you and you will feel invincible. There will be fights, but they don\u2019t feel the same. Nothing is perfect. No amount of love, no amount of dedication, no amount of support can save you from the fact that there will be fights. Sometimes they will seem so serious that it will take your mind back to other relationships in the past that weren\u2019t so good it might even make you think \u201cmaybe this is over too.\u201d But soon after you realise that it is all apart of the process, they occur to make you understand something about the other that you didn\u2019t previously, and once understood you move on and you grow from it as a couple. I learnt that nothing is perfect, but within the imperfection is progress, there is something to strive for together. ",

But, the second you start looking what your partner put, and say \u201cI always put more than him, I must ask him to put more\u201d the relation will start to get weaker and and peaky. And you have to remember that \u201c Everyone has a capability of giving, and as long as he/she doesn't get cheap and put what he can, you can't blame him/her.\u201d ",

Most often, we hurry to rid ourselves of loneliness. We fall for the idea of not being alone rather than the person. Those flaws you ignored gradually grow into you, plaguing you with self-doubt and finally smothering what you were hurrying to call \u2018Love.\u2019 I personally think that \u2018patience' and \u2018self-control' conjure best form of love.

Over time, you find out they are not perfect. Putting any other person on a pedestal just sets you up for disappointment. This is true for friends, colleagues, or lovers. It\u2019s also unfair, as the person who is put in the pedestal is not consulted when these amazing qualities are assigned to them, but they are blamed when they do not live up to these impossible standards.
