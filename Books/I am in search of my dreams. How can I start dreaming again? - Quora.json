            "answer_text": "Yeah, I understand your situation. It\u2019s like you get locked in whatever direction you turn. Whether it is an anxiety or an actual situation, it\u2019s hard to change the routine or intoduce a new element. Like Jim Carrey\u2019s character in the Truman Show. Blocked at every turn. I am like this a lot of the time too. It\u2019s a deep rut and it seems hard to climb out. Maybe start with little pleasures, baby steps that are easy to do that don\u2019t seem too intimidating and yet are pushing the edge of your \u2018normal\u2019. Go for a long walk in a neighborhood you have never been before. Talk to strangers. Watch comedy movies to loosen up the serious streaks. I like Will Ferrel in the movie Stranger Than Fiction, which is about a similar life situation. Laughing at myself sometimes helps. Writing is also helpful. Like sitting down and having a friendly conversation with yourself. If you really want to go for it - get out of town. Going to visit an entirely different city is a great way to brainstorm your life, introduce new ideas and possibilities. Go to see a play or visit something novel about that city\u2026 Give yourself \u2018homework assignments\u2019 like this. ",
