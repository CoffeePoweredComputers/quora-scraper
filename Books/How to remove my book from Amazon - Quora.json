            "answer_text": "The funny thing is you can\u2019t. I tried this before at the behest of a client. This was back when KDP was still Createspace. The problem is that once a book becomes available on KDP, it enters into the whole \u201cBooks in Print\u201d universe which goes beyond just Amazon. If you list a book on Amazon, notice how quickly it gets transferred over to other book stores like Barnes And Noble. Therefore, if Amazon lists it, then Barnes And Noble lists it. And if Barnes And Noble lists it, then Amazon lists it. So even if you remove the KDP listing of your book, the Amazon listing will remain so long as the ISBN remains because of the Books in Print listing that we have no control over. And even if no ISBN is associated, a description of the book itself may remain. Though, in most cases, books without ISBNs aren\u2019t really kept track of by large book chains for practical reasons - the most obvious being an inability to track the book through its ISBN. The book I tried to remove from Amazon is still there. Because it has an ISBN and Amazon tracks all ISBNs. And you can\u2019t really delete an ISBN. ",
