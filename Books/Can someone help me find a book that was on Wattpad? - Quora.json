            "answer_text": "This is the person who asked the question, this is just some context and information about the book that I remember. There was a book that I read a while ago that somehow got deleted from my library and archives. I don't remember the title, author or the names of the characters. This is the plot: the oldest princess of kingdom 1 gets kidnapped by the prince and a soldier of kingdom 2. While being kidnapped she sees her half-brother/bodyguard get stabbed and assumes that he has died (he doesn't). She is taken to kingdom 2, where she is interrogated by the king of kingdom 2 about the disappearance of several of his people and his children, he believes that her father the king of kingdom 1 was behind it all. They torture her for information that she does not have and keep her locked inside a chamber guarded by soldiers 24/7. The prince of kingdom 2 seems to passionately hate the princess of kingdom 1. There's one specific scene where a man who hates kingdom 1 sneaks into her chamber and attempts to assault her and kill her. He is only able to cut her thigh with his knife before the prince of kingdom 2 bursts in after hearing her muffled cries from outside and beat the man and had him taken to the dungeon. Also in the end the prince and princess escape the castle with the help of his mother and told to find a man that lives in the mountain that would help them stop the prince's father from doing something terrible. This is a completed story. I know this is a long shot but this story was really good and well written and I'm very upset that I can't seem to find it. If anyone has any clue as to what story this was please help me out. Thanks in advance! ",

            "answer_text": "In what context? A book already on Wattpad? Cause I can link you to mine \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Or do you mean a book that was on Wattpad, that has now been successfully published as a hardcover/paperback book and lies awaiting to be bought or borrowed from a library or a bookstore? Cause if so, I do know one but it\u2019s a romance that plays out like a well-written one direction fanfiction. ",
