            "answer_text": "Its hard predicting time without knowing person's learning rate or requirement. Time required doesnt match for most people. Some learn fast and can put the exact clause in paper successfully anyday but cant figure examples that can match similar scenarios. Others take a life time(5 yrs itself a life in CSc now as technology keep changing and people keep jumping jobs :)) just to figure very examples and only then say end to it. As a beginner we mostly search and learn from source code :( even I did same :) whereas Cormen, very exhaustive in algorithms, uses psuedo code and mathamatical details to prime. So read little of Discreete Mathamatics(suggesting wiki pages, they will be small and you can read them fast) which you will be needing for particular Algorithm before hand, giving you clear idea this way and enough time to experiment also.   A very important thing is that the whole of the listings in that book is actually not required for an interview(only otherwise when you are suppose to be interviewd for a particular topic). So identify the Algorithm topics you need(maybe the simplar ones) and go with the desired readings. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! I have already answered about Reading CLRS here : Vikesh Tiwari's answer to How should I use the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen? I think 7 months in enough for reading the whole Book if you have good mathematical background, so read few chapters of the book, if you are finding it very difficult to understand proofs, functions etc then definitely you need some mathematical knowledge just read basics of Summation , Probability, Sets, relations, Proofs then start again.  You can refer my answer about how to read this book, and definitely  don't just read CLRS only, if you're preparing for interviews. You have to practice Algorithmic problems, learn and implement of basic data structures linked list, stack, queue, how it works and all about memory management malloc, calloc functions etc.  I don't have any interview experience till now currently in Second Year :)  You can also refer to my project fork it, contribute to it or refer to Project Webpage ~AlgoWiki and Interview Preparation Tag AlgoWiki Hope it Helps!Thanks!
