            "answer_text": "Citing a quote from a book is simple. In all citation styles, you\u2019ll need to specify: AuthorPage or line from where you took a quote.Optionally, in APA, Harvard and Chicago author-date style, you\u2019ll also need to specify publication date in years. If you cite Shakespeare, Bible or other classic text, rules are different. In the Bible, for instance, you\u2019ll need to specify the version, verse, and line \u2014 for example, (Matthew 12:1). You may also introduce the quote in the text. In MLA, APA and Harvard styles, if you mention the author in writing, you won\u2019t need to duplicate it in parentheses. Moreover, there are some limitations to the quotes you can use. APA limits the size of a quote from a book to 40 words, while MLA provides four lines. Alternatively, you may use block quotes that overcome these limits, but they should be intended and styles correctly. I highly recommend checking an Academic Guide on How to Use Quotes to see all the variety of options, guides, and limitations for major citation styles, because your situation may be different from what I described.
