            "answer_text": "I really appreciate your idea of gifting audible book to a person, I must say it is a very nice thought. It is very simple. There are two ways :- If you already have an audible account, buy a book and share your password with the person you want to gift the book.If you're not comfortable sharing your password, and the books you listen to them then there is another way also. 2. Take audible free trail or paid subscription for certain time, and give those account credentials to that person. This way, you'll be gifting whole Amazon audible collection not just one book. Since audible provides credits according to our subscription, there won't be need to spend extra money to listen the books. Just borrow a book by using the credits and listen to it, then return it. And. Repeat the process. Choose your way of gifting audible wisely. Happy Reading and Happy sharing the privilege of Reading. Goodluck! ",
