Some critics claim this series to be a serious competition to LOTR when it comes to the style of writing and creativity. The story is multidimensional and really well thought of. I'm certain that the 2nd part would get her a booker award!You can also start listening to Rebecca Black while you're at it, she is also an a great artist, she just won a grammy! I wish you all the best in life, you're the future of this cynical world. Beware of all the sarcastic buffoons out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of reading Twilight, go read this: Luminosity | A Re-imagining of Twilight | By Alicorn Luminosity is a piece of fanfiction inspired by Eliezer Yudkowsky's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.  The initial setting is exactly the same as Twilight, except for one thing: Bella is a serious rationalist and self-awareness junkie, rather than a twit.  As it goes on, the plot becomes unrecognizable, though elements of the original story are still present, just changed. Add to that the fact that Alicorn can write circles around Stephenie Meyer, and you actually have something that's worth reading. The complete story consists of Luminosity (Book One), Radiance (Book Two), and Flashes (a series of short stories).  Go forth and start reading.  I bet you'll become a member of Team Luminous!Bella before you know it. ",
