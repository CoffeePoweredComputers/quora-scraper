            "answer_text": "As much as I hate to say it, You Can't.  Anyone claiming to read at such speed is either genetically gifted or lying. The maximum that one can reach is around 550 wpm. There are some limitations of the human eye which restrict humans from exceeding this speed.  I read around 480 wpm that too when I know the underlying concepts well. If it is my first read (a topic I have very little knowledge of) then my speed can go to as low as 300 wpm. Also, I developed this skill after some years.  So, you might want to reconsider your target time frame and target speed. I suggest you start with a variety of different topics and read at a slightly higher pace (~275 wpm). Once you get a hang of the basic structure of different topics, you can up the speed. Example, read the basics about micro and macro economics at ~275 wpm. After understanding the basics, when you go on to read advanced stuff, you should be able to read faster and comprehend better. ",
