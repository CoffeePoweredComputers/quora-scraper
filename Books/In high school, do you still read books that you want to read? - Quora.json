            "answer_text": "Excellent question. In high school you will read many books that you did not choose to read, whether these be text books in classes like Chemistry and History, or assigned works of literature in English and other humanities classes. You can always read books you like on your own time, but can you read books you want to read, as part of school! This is where it requires some initiative on your part, but I suggest that it will definitely be worth the effort. You can\u2019t avoid the assigned books. Read them and learn what they have to offer. On the other hand, if you have a specific interest and you can include ideas from an additional book when speaking up in class or writing a paper, do so by all means. Just be sure to footnote or reference your sources and ideas! In fact, doing so will let your teachers know that you are motivated to learn, well-read, and can integrate new ideas into the more standardized teaching methods they are using. If you are assigned a paper, pick a topic that meshes with a book you\u2019ve read or want to read. You can even recommend to one of your teachers that they read (or even assign) a book you\u2019ve read. Let them know why it is special; they just might you take you up on the suggestion. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course I do. We still have libraries, and if I\u2019m being honest - Quora is the only interesting online thing that I read anymore. Most of my friends and I treasure the fact that we\u2019ve read every fantasy that is a John Green classic. I\u2019ve read every Percy Jackson book, every Harry Potter book, and I\u2019m currently starting the Divergent and Hunger Games series.   At my school, we have access to every book imaginable. There are self help books (Which actually are kind of sad), there\u2019s manga, there are romantic comedies (J o h n G r e e n), there are fiction/nonfiction, there are how-to books. Yes I still read books that I want to, and so do many of my friends. The high schoolers that don\u2019t are either not satisfied by reading, are too lazy to read, or are very behind in there reading skill. That\u2019s it for now - Good looking out* ",
