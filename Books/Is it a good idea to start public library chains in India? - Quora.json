            "answer_text": " I had first tried Just Books in 2010 when they had a handful of chains in Bangalore and were slowly expanding across India. Fast forward 2013, they were aggressively expanding across South India opening one store every fortnight (one of my classmate was leading the southern sales) and as of 2017, they are not doing as expected. Several of their store have either closed down or shifted to save real estate cost. They currently have ~69 stores across India. The model of Just Books was brilliant. One needs to become member with either of the below mentioned plans and you can borrow books based on plan. In any of the plans, user can read as many books as possible. They had large spacious AC stores where user can read the books or carry back home after RFID checkout.  JustBooks Plans They were operating on a simple franchise model where each store will start with ~10,000 volumes and books will be kept on adding every month. Popular books will be added at higher pace and the since the copies are limited but demand is high, the volumes will be exchanged between stores. They even have free door delivery option. Just Books stores even organized summer camps, writers meet and other social events to gather crowd. They staff were particularly trained to be friendly and franchisee owners were carefully selected. Many of them were highly educated. As brilliant and lucrative as it sounds, the stores were not profitable. They could just break even. There were many reasons to it. The initial cost is high: Forget the rent, forget the real estate advance, forget the salaries. Before everything else, one needs to spend atleast 10\u201315 Lakhs on furniture and books. 10,000 volumes come at a cost.Rent and Operating expense: A 3000 sq.ft space will easily attract over 30,000\u201350,000 of monthly rent plus electricity bill plus salaries (store needs to be opened for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week).Mindset: Both the stores I visited in Bangalore are close to fast food joints or pubs or hotels. People come and spend 5x the monthly membership fee on a single sitting eating junk or boozing out but will still complain about the fee at JustBooks.With these major hurdles, starting a public library is still a good option. It is the most noble thing to do but expecting profit out of it is difficult. Cut down the real estate cost. It can be your home or a cheap rented place in interiors.Get volunteers. Salaried employees are not feasible. Ask local people (kids or senior citizens) to support with maintaining the library.Cut down on initial investment. Start humble with minimum volumes, rely on donations or buy cheap second hand books from streets.Market aggressively in your local with word of mouth and on digital media. Do not spend beyond sliding in pamphlets in newspaper.Rely on donations from local leaders or businessmen.Pricing is key. Once all the above parameters are met, you can price just enough to make a profit and still run a sustainable business model.Be innovative. Think differently. I am out of ideas.",

            "answer_text": "Hi, One of my client started a public library and reading centre in Pune. Reading room is a major earning resource in this industry. So accordingly I will be able to provide an insight into regards to the question. The major issues in earning profits are as follow as: Rent: The libraries and reading centres requires a lot of space. So even if the place isn't upscale, rent would be anywhere minimum Rs.2.5 lakhs per month in a city . If you have a place of your own then you should consider opportunity cost in this case. You will be required to atleast have 250 no. of students in your reading centre at any given point to breakeven the rental cost. Leave the opportunity cost.Air conditioning: Now a days, almost every library has air conditioning. No doubt, people can charge decent for the AC rooms but still these rooms are occupied during summer only.Furniture : You need a lot of furnishing to keep the place attractive. It will be very costly to have such amount of furniture which is going to be depreciated earlier than usual.Service tax issues: Reading room charges are taxable services under service tax laws hence, they were required to pay service tax which they couldn't recover directly through students as it would have again increased the competition.Purchase of books: You need to buy lots of books which are new and original. They increase cost and reduce margins upto a great extent.Deep pockets of investors: My friend invested around 50 lakhs through his dad but when the business couldn't earn operational profits within 1.5 years, he had to close the library.Opportunity cost: Every business model largely works on this concept. At times this cost isn't recoverable even as it is more public charity.I hope my answer was useful. Regards, Aditya ",
