            "answer_text": "Question: If you couldn\u2019t get a novel traditionally published, would you self-publish it and move on to your next project, or would you keep re-drafting it in the hope that it might eventually get traditionally published? Answer: Neither. That\u2019s limited thinking deriving from a lack of imagination and research. That\u2019s just the thinking of a bad author. First - let\u2019s take a look at a couple of successful strategies that have been used. Lois McMaster Bujold wrote a great short science fiction novel. No one would publish it. She did NOT waste time fiddling with it. She wrote another novel. No one would publish it. She did not waste time fiddling with it. She wrote another novel in the same series. And again. The fourth one got an agent and publisher interested in publishing three of her novels. So - her first novel finally got published. And promptly won a Hugo. Not much point in polishing and fiddling with a novel that\u2019s good enough to win a Hugo is there? Do NOT make the mistake of thinking that quality alone gets a book published or selling. Another example - another approach. Jim Butcher wrote several of his Science fantasy magical novels. Couldn\u2019t get them published. So he spent his time attending Sci-fi conventions. Made some good contacts and got a publisher and \u2026 went on to become the best selling author we know today. So that\u2019s two approaches the question doesn\u2019t even consider. Why not? Probably because of a lack of imagination and research. How do I know about the above two stories? I did some research on this problem. So - what\u2019s wrong with self-publishing? Nothing - provided you understand that it is the publisher who has to market the book. Example - The Alchemist was written by Paulo Coelho and published by a publisher with no marketing plan. Result - 2 sales in 2 years. No one can buy a book they\u2019ve never heard of. He eventually regained the rights and got it published by a publisher who knew how to market it. Result - 60 million plus sales in 80 different languages. No point in polishing or fiddling with the book. And there is no point in self publishing unless you are prepared to create and implement the marketing plan. So - do you want to spend the next two years on marketing, or on writing another book? Conclusion. There is no point in fiddling and polishing a really good book that just needs an agent or publisher. There is no point in offering less than one\u2019s best for publication anyway, but once one has done one\u2019s best, don\u2019t waste more time on it. When one has a publisher, spend time working with their demands. Otherwise progress in other ways. There is no point in self-publishing unless one is prepared to do the necessary marketing. Without that, one is just making it less likely that a traditional publisher will ever take it up. What one does need to do is some research into marketing and the problems of getting published, and then come up with a strategy to get yourself published. Jim Butcher came up with a good one. Sometimes it\u2019s not what you write but who you know \u2026 Here\u2019s a plot for your next story. No world building necessary. A new author has written a good book but is having trouble getting it published. He / She \u2026 And the story has a happy ending. Which might include self-publishing and some great marketing. Now - do your research, come up with a great plot, and make it happen. That\u2019s what good authors can do. Yes - that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d self-publish it. However, I have done my research on all the various moving parts that go into doing that, and done it successfully for my PR and Marketing clients. If you haven\u2019t bothered to learn what those moving parts are, much less how to manage them, then publishing it yourself isn\u2019t going to work out well for more than 99 in 100 people. The stats are clear\u2014fewer than 1% do more than break even. I\u2019ve seen spectacular results of launching a book properly. But even that can fizzle, as we\u2019re playing the odds with this, not using a guaranteed-to-work checklist. The odds go up, however\u2014significantly higher than 1% for each book. By publishing more than one, and doing each of them effectively, you\u2019ll eventually hit a kind of critical mass that brings the kind of success that snowballs into a writing career. For those who don\u2019t have the time to master a dozen specialties that go into a proper book launch, I strongly recommend you keep writing. Write the next book. Push that to publishers while you write the third one. Eventually, a publisher will want what you\u2019re offering, and you can then tell them you have a back catalog of unpublished MSS. That\u2019s a huge plus to a publisher because it tells them you have more than one book in you, and they can jump on what you already have and may consider a serial launch. Good luck! ",
