            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not clear on what you mean. Taking your question literally, the answer to how is: payment by direct deposits and by checks. Amazon, for example, pays by direct deposit monthly. A large corporation buying a quantity of books, however, would likely pay by check. Likewise, publishers pay their authors by both direct deposit and check. If you mean how does the revenue flow (from where), which for some reason is what I suspect you\u2019re asking\u2026 Publishers get their revenue from a combination of distributors and direct sales: Distributors handle the money coming in from the dozens of retail outlets such as Amazon, libraries, independent bookstores, military PXs, and more. This means that publishers can get a single payment from a distributor instead of dozens or even hundreds of payments from all these individual sales outlets. Much simpler bookkeeping! Conversely, publishers don\u2019t have to worry about chasing down money from all these sources either. In exchange for this simplicity, the distributor takes a cut of approximately 55% of the retail revenue (cover price); however, most of this (about 40% of the cover price) is earned by the retail outlet, meaning the distributor gets about 15% of the cover price.Direct sales are essentially anything outside the distribution agreement. A good example is what I mentioned at the start of this answer \u2014 a large corporation buys 500 copies of a book for its employees or customers. No sane publisher would run this sale through its distributor (thus giving up the percentage), so it\u2019s a direct sale.Authors, likewise, get their revenue from a combination of their publisher (royalties) and direct sales: Most publishers pay quarterly (if a minimum threshold is met) for sales ending the prior quarterly period. This may or may not coincide with the calendar quarters, so the delay between a particular book\u2019s sale and payment to the author may be 60, 90, 120, or more days. This lag is largely due to allowing time for returns; you don\u2019t want to pay the author for a sale and then have to retract that money if the book gets returned.Authors who smartly engage in direct sales can earn better amounts of money than royalties typically earn. Most publishers offer \u201cauthor discount\u201d copies at, typically, 50% off the cover price. This allows authors to re-sell the copies through their own websites, speaking engagements, or other avenues and make much more money per sale than through royalties (which are typically 10\u201315% of the cover price). I made almost all the money I earned from my first trade publishing deal this way.Note: Publishing revenues can be more complicated than what I\u2019ve described above, and the above doesn\u2019t encompass all possibilities. I hope this helps! [Answered: How do authors and publishers get paid?] ",

            "answer_text": "The first payment, called an advance, is an advance against royalties. The payment is determined by your contact. Subsequent payments usually come quarterly although some publishers may do on a different schedule. Those payments come along with a royalty statement showing how many sales were made and, thus, how much you are owed. ",
