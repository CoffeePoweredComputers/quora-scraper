            "answer_text": "It depends on the age and the kind of likes the kid has. I think Geronimo Stilton is a gender neutral childhood book for kids that they'd enjoy a lot. Or Enid Blytons Famous Five, the Secret Seven, or the Mallory Towers. Or Roald Dahl. Or Ruskin Bond. And there are the kid versions of classics like Oliver Twist, Emma, Jane Eyre, Little Women. THERE'S A LOT! Or maybe let the child decide. Let them read the descriptions and decide what they'd like to read. ",
