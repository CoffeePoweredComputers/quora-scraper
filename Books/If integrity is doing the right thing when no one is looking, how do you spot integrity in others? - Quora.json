            "answer_text": "First, \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d is a tricky concept. What may be considered by you to be the right thing may not be the same for others. For example, you may think that abortions are immoral. Others, of course, completely disagree with you. So \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d is based on perceptions, not definitions. Second, integrity requires observation. For someone to look at someone else and say, \u201cthat is a man of integrity\u201d requires observation. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible for someone to prove integrity without observational proof. Therefore I don\u2019t think integrity IS doing the right thing when no one is looking. That doesn\u2019t seem accurate. Instead, I would say that integrity is more about holding to your own set of beliefs, and sticking to them, even when challenged by others. I may disagree with whether or not you support or do not support abortions, but just because I disagree doesn\u2019t mean you lack integrity. Especially if you really, truly believe what you are saying and can back that up with examples. There\u2019s a difference between integrity and morality. ",

            "answer_text": "Integrity is not only \"doing the right thing when no one is looking\"... It's a much broader concept and you can't actually \"spot\" it in others just like that. Even though I wish I could! That would've helped a lot in the past. ;) I think there are only two ways one has a chance of finding that out. The short way and the long way. The short way is doing a careful research about the reputation of that person. If that brings up a consistent record of reputable deeds one can come to some sorts of conclusion about the integrity. The long way: You have to experience that person yourself in different situations and you have to talk with that person about her view on diverse situations. Experiencing the reactions of that person in real life situations is more significant than what she tells you. Words are not really that meaningful, actions are! ;)One last word. DEFINE for yourself first what YOU think integrity encompasses... ",
