            "answer_text": "First, here is the reply about not knowing the name, cut and pasted. YET I NEVER KNEW HER NAME. Do not take the following as too simple. Charlie Brown was also in love with a little red headed girl, and he did not know her name. As a life long collector, each edition is introduced by someone WITH A NAME IN HIGH STANDING, POSSIBLY SO IT IS NOT DISMISSED AS FUNNY PAGES RUBBISH. I went through it myself, falling in love with girls I do not even know. THE KIND OF LOVE FELT FOR THE ROSE, NOT KNOWING HER NAME CAN BE AN ILLUSION MUCH LIKE THE SIRENS. He does not even know her name. You can see in the movie her kind play by throwing bird feces at each other. HE IS NOT IN LOVE WITH HER, IT IS A HUMAN INSTINCT, OFTEN LEADING IN NEGATIVE DIRECTIONS. HE\u2026.DIDN\u2019T EVEN KNOW HER NAME. To sum this up, I am 51 now, and remember feelings of love so powerful, but they are inside us. Not knowing the girl\u2019s name is a way of saying he doesn\u2019t know her at all. I compared her to the Greek Sirens, luring seamen to their death on rocks, which, ( please forgive a little humour, I know the mad monk forgave NO LAUGHTER), but crashing on rocks might at times be a better fate than moving from a privileged student for life to an impoverished peasant, who impregnated the rose, did learn her name, and ended his days working himself almost to death to support his family. And she doesn\u2019t look like a Rose anymore\u2026and he is not \u201cyoung and beautiful\u201d anymore as his teacher described him when he had her in the \u201cdreadful kitchen\u201d. She would no longer give an old, hard working peasant with a family her \u201ccarnal favours for free\u201d. I know I am guilty of laughter here, have analyzed almost every scene in the movie, and was almost killed by the boredom of the book, no poison pages ( or computer keys ) needed. If anyone would like to discuss what else that movie had to offer, please contact me. I might actually fight my way through the book, or try again\u2026but life is so short. If I don\u2019t answer, I didn\u2019t get the mail. I always try to answer. This story had a lot to teach me about life, and played a small part in my interest in Christianity as a born Jew. I spoke to a priest about converting, and to honour his memory I will stay Jewish as he wanted. I did not know it at the time but he was a famous man. One thing I picked up from christian thought. Is fame valuable? It can be taken as part of the central debate. Should the church value wealth and fame? A very high level powerful monk at the debate was being \u201cpushed around\u201d by the murderous hunchback who was keeping the peasants in line. Why? He looked like a poor peasant. A very interesting debate. ",

            "answer_text": "SPOILERS! Adso of Melk (Christian Slater) was still a young boy mentored by William Baskerville (Sir Sean Connery) to become a monk, so not sure how it would've worked out! Besides, the film tells you at the end; Adso decides to go with Brother William to continue his education. His closing dialogue says it all - \u201cI have never regretted my decision, for I learned from my master much that was wise and good and true. When at last we parted company, he presented me with his eyeglasses. I was still young - he said - but someday they would serve me well. And in fact, I'm wearing them now on my nose as I write these lines. Then he embraced me fondly - like a father - and sent me on my way. I never saw him again, and know not what became of him, but I pray always that God received his soul, and forgave the many little vanities to which he was driven by his intellectual pride. And yet, now that I am an old, old man, I must confess that of all the faces that appear to me out of the past, the one I see most clearly is that of the girl of whom I've never ceased to dream these many long years. She was the only earthly love in my life, yet I never knew, nor ever learned, her name.\u201d Great stuff! ",
