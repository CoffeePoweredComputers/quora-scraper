            "answer_text": "We have to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts of globalization. The short-term effects of globalization are often very disruptive. Production tends to shift to wherever it\u2019s cheapest. That mans that people in more developed economies will lose jobs to people in less developed economies. The benefit for the developed economy is that the people there will be able to buy the foreign-manufactured products more cheaply than domestically produced ones. Unfortunately, these gains and costs aren\u2019t evenly distributed. The fact that Americans can buy a shirt for 10% less at Walmart doesn\u2019t console the Americans who lost their jobs making shirts. At the same time people are losing their jobs, business owners often increase their profits by offshoring. The combination worsens income inequality, which is linked to a host of societal ills. These problems are exacerbated the faster that globalization occurs, for the simple reason that it takes time for people to find new jobs and for new industries to emerge. If a major new trade deal leads to a flurry of jobs leaving a country, some of the people who wind up unemployed may never find career-quality employment again, instead having to work temporary or part-time jobs because it\u2019s all they can find. Long-term, the effects of globalization should be generally positive. Globalization makes economies more efficient, by eliminating the barriers that keep work in places where it doesn\u2019t make sense. After a wrenching period of adjustment, either industries should become more efficient (as we ultimately saw in the American automobile industry) or will die out in certain countries, freeing up workers to do other things. The biggest downside remains the worsening of income inequality that I mentioned earlier. Even in the long run, globalization tends to benefit business owners over employees. For it to really benefit the population at large, governments need to make policies that ensure that economic growth translates into benefits for the population at large. In general, this means taxing business profits (either directly or through taxing the shareholders and executives who share in those profits) and using that revenue to strengthen safety nets like welfare and disability, social programs like education, etc. The United States has done a poor job of translating globalization-related economic growth into benefits for citizens. China has done a somewhat better job, but still not a good one, with many citizens literally cheated out of their homes while a class of well-connected businesspeople become staggeringly rich. I wish I could point to a country that has been an exemplar of handling globalization well, but none comes to mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it allows specialization and comparative advantage to work: you do only what you\u2019re good at, export it in big quantities and import the rest, roughly. The products used to be so simple that basically any country could make any of them (say, a horsewagon, a military rifle, a kerosene lamp). Not anymore. In 1970s Intel has designed first truly widespread CPU, 8080. The transistor count was smth like 6,000. I\u2019ve read somewhere that working out the design cost Intel several hundred thousand dollars. Fast forward to today:  Nowadays modern CPUs have transistor counts in billions. What used to be a simple process turned into something that requires Intel to spend something on the order of $10bln to set up a single fabrication facility. And those are just capital costs. Mergers and acquisitions happen not because Evel Businessmen want it that way, they happen because making products and services ever more sophisticated and capable and serving ever more demanding public is increasingly costly. That in turn requires global markets, so that the huge costs involved can be recouped by serving hundreds of millions of people and exploiting economies of scale: Economies Of Scale Definition | Investopedia. Where productivity is stagnant and economies of scale cannot be realized, it leads to serious economic and/or social trouble, just two examples: All countries experience rising costs of healthcare (caused by so called stagnant productivity in services), regardless of the system they chose (be it US mess or European style single-payer); that puts increasing strain on their economiesAirlines (no economies of scale to speak of): systematically in bankrupcies, unprofitable",
