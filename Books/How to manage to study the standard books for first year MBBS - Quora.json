Step 2 - go to class and concentrate. Ask question if you don\u2019t understand. Step 3 - go back and read the same pages that you read in Step 1. Ask your friend if you have confusion. Step 4 - go and see the lecturer if you still having difficulty to understand that topic. Step 5 - spend some times for sports and leisure. Don\u2019t forget to get a boyfriend/girlfriend. Don\u2019t be such a nerd. Trust me. Good luck!!! ",
