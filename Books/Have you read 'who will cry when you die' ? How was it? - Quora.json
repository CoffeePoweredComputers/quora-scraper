            "answer_text": "Yes ! Who will cry when you die is a self-help book authored by Robin Sharma which I read way back when I was really into the self help genre. You don\u2019t have to be a self-help genre lover to enjoy this book. All you need is a motive to improve yourself and this book is perfect for that. My thoughts on this book: I absolutely love self help books which have bullet points and short descriptions instead of extremely long stories on how someone turned their life around (not that it\u2019s wrong, just not my cup of tea). This book has 101 pointers on how to live your best life.It goes without saying that self help books are not the one-for-all solution to all your life problems however they do give you this motivational high which stays with you until you wake up the next day. It is up to you how you make use of that!You might even come across some point that you might not have given any thought before in your life. That\u2019s what makes this book worth reading.Other books by Robin Sharma worth checking out: The Monk who sold his Ferrari. Happy Reading! ",
