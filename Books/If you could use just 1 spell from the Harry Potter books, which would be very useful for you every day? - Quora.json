If anything is broken, just use Reparo to fix it. Never have to call a technician\u2026 that is assuming it works on everything. In the books it was used for glasses and other non-electrical things. But the spell is only as good as the wizard/witch. I bet Hermione would be able to repair almost anything. ",
