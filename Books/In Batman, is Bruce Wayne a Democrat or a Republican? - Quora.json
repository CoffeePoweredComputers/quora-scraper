            "answer_text": "In terms of politics, I would say that Bruce Wayne would belong to the moderate wing of the Republican Party known as the Rockefeller Republicans. Here is an accurate depiction of what Rockefeller Republicans are. This is because he disagrees with Green Arrow on certain issues, who is the New Deal Liberal of the DC Universe. But he does agree with the social beliefs of Green Arrow and rejects characters such as Aquman, Hawkman, Red Hood, and his own son Damien\u2019s views. The problem with making declarations of which political party a superhero is a part of is that it is done normally by people who watch the movies and do not look at the character\u2019s complete comic book history. Not only do you have to look at how a character is portrayed consistently throughout their history, but you have to look at the super villains they fight. While many of his villains would be viewed as liberal caricatures such as Posion Ivy, he also fights many villains from his own socioeconomic class such as Hush and the Penguin. Therefore he is against the extremes of the Left and the Right. Batman in my opinion is more of a Rockefeller Republican, and would be quite similar to a mixture of Nelson Rockefeller and Theodore Roosevelt in real life. This is because while he would be pro - gun control but frame it in terms of being tough on crime. Many seem to think that Batman would support tough on crime policies, which he probably would. But he would target more of the criminals themselves and focus on balancing rehabilitation and punishment. He would support the current War On Drugs as it targets users and not dealers. However, he would support making more focused on dealers because he believes that all criminals should be punished. However, I do not believe that he would support police brutality and the death penalty. This is because he is generally against an abuse of power, which shows throughout many of the Batman stories. Bruce would be anti - death penalty because he believes that criminals can still be rehabilitated, despite his pessimism in the comics and other forms of media. This is why he doesn\u2019t kill the Joker, and the comic books show that killing criminals is wrong, which is why he disagrees with Jason Todd and Damian Wayne. Batman would definitely be in favor of the Patriot Act and would target dealers not users when it comes to the War On Drugs. He would be disturbed at how many people would be in prison due to using drugs, and would prefer rehabilitation. But he would definitely be tough on drug dealers since he is against crime. Batman\u2019s general philosophy in politics would probably be \u201cTough on crime and the roots of crime.\u201d Which is why he would also support strong public schools. In terms of Presidents, he would probably be these three Presidents: Dwight Eisenhower: Batman as Bruce Wayne would be similar to Eisenhower in terms of personality as well as Eisenhower\u2019s approach to politics and foreign affairs.Richard Nixon: Bruce would definitely have Nixon\u2019s paranoia, but not his anti - semitism. He would agree with Nixon\u2019s \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies except for capital punishment.Theodore Roosevelt: In terms of life story as well as politics, both Bruce and Teddy are similar to each other. Bruce would definitely have TR\u2019s stubbornness fueled by Nixon\u2019s paranoia, but he would be able to maintain his cool due to having Eisenhower\u2019s calm demeanor.",

            "answer_text": "Batman has strong values and beliefs, both in terms of society and the government. These have nothing to do with Bruce Wayne's political affiliation. The great likelihood is Bruce Wayne is a Democrat, because wealthy Democrats are visible and plentiful and therefore almost invisible. He probably gives money to candidates of any party, and many of his donations are strategic and derisory so that he can play the role he's supposed to play. He may give larger donations and give speeches for people he actually supports, but always within the greater context of the 'Bruce Wayne' layabout rich philanthropist character. In terms of his personal politics and voting -- and behind the scenes/anonymous support -- Batman likely can't be pigeonholed into one of the parties. He clearly has strong Conservative aspects, having dealt with the monumental corruption that can infect government and having the driving need to stop evil (as opposed to the Liberal 'promote good'). At the same time, he has strong liberal and philanthropic beliefs regarding the responsibilities of the wealthy to the poor. He would want to preserve the rights and freedoms of others -- as well as protect them -- but would likely be almost unusually pro-Gun Control given his personal feelings about guns. My suspicion is he'd believe strongly in the Conservative/Republican Small Government ideal, but also believe strongly in the Liberal/Democrat Social Rights and Protections -- in other words, he'd want to both protect the group from the individual and the individual from the group. He seems the opposite of the Objectivist Enlightened Self-Interest model -- most of what Batman does is altruistic, both as a philanthropist and in the millions of dollars he sinks into fighting crime and protecting others. He's a Randian nightmare, really.  In other words... Batman/Bruce Wayne's persona would be an idle rich liberal philanthropist Hollywood Democrat. His personal beliefs, on the other hand, would range all over the usual  spectrum. In other OTHER words... Batman wouldn't be a Democrat or a Liberal beyond a surface mask for 'Bruce Wayne.' Batman would be Batman, with Batman's politics, and no interest in conforming to a broad platform from any party. Every political faction can find something that evokes Batman, and every political faction can find something Batman would decry. So. I'm going with 'Citizen.' ",
