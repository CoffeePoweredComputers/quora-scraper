            "answer_text": "You will need a literary agent in order to publish a novel through HC\u2014or any of the Big 5\u2014or the Top 10 US publishers. The Big 5 are Harper Collins, Penguin Random House, Macmillan, Simon & Schuster, and Hachette. Rounding these out for novels are the Top 3 independents\u2014Sourcebooks (of which PRH just bought a 45% share), Algonquin, Kensington. Elsewhere on Quora there is a lot written about how to get a literary agent. My top three ways are: cold queries to a small, targeted group of agents who rep what you write (find them in the acknowledgements sections of books you love)pitch sessions at well known, reputable conferences, such as ThrillerFest, New York Writers Workshop, the Atlanta Writers Conferencepersonal referrals having gotten to know authors\u2014go to their book events when they are on tour; write fan letters; sign up for their newsletters, then correspond; network with them at consHaving a literary agent is not a guarantee that Harper, or any publisher or press, will make an offer on your novel, but it is a prerequisite (barring some outside-the-box solution, such as you have a personal referral to an editor, and the editor wants to make an offer\u2026in which case she will basically then refer you to agents anyway before a deal is made). Top houses no longer take so-called over-the-transom or slush pile submissions from the author him or herself, except in very rare instances of open-sub times, which not all publishers even have (those that do have them don\u2019t always pay much attention to what comes in that way). A literary agent will enable your novel or book proposal to be submitted, and sometimes an offer will result, sometimes you\u2019ll get \u201cpasses,\u201d sometimes you\u2019ll get feedback that makes you want to revise\u2014and then hope that your agent wisely left houses still to go to with the new, improved version, since you can\u2019t go twice to the same house or imprint with the same book. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "First, you will look online for HarperCollins\u2019 guidelines for writers. That will tell you what they want you to do, and what they don\u2019t. You will need to have an agent, of course, so if you don\u2019t have one, get one. Your agent will let you know how much of the book needs to be done before she/he can approach the chosen editor on your behalf. If you are a new writer, this may be the entire book. Or you may only need three chapters.

As they would know how to pitch your story to them, for them to be interested and take up publishing of your book. Approaching HarperCollins individually would be a great mistake.
