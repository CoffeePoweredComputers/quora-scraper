            "answer_text": "Operating on the conventional understanding of a dystopia being a functional society, yet one characterized by totalitarian or oppressive elements (in contrast to an anarchic \u201cwasteland\u201d a la Mad Max), I would choose to live in the Citizen Federation as depicted in the Starship Troopers movie series.  Yes! Yes, you would like to know more! Pros - It\u2019s a society that operates with a full absence of any national, racial, or gender-centric biases. It is also one that encourages and incentivizes the notion of civic service. There seems to be little trouble in the way of resource scarcity: Everybody appears to have adequate food, shelter, and healthcare, and consequently nearly everybody in the Federation - men and women alike - look absolutely beautiful. Cons - A flat-out exclusion from participation in the democratic process against anyone who does not voluntarily commit themselves to a period of civic service, with the bulk of this activity going toward supporting an obscenely large military force engaged in a perpetual war effort. The social order makes a distinction between \u201ccitizens\u201d (meaning veterans) and \u201ccivilians\u201d, with the latter group being excluded from having any political authority through either voting or holding public office and presumably other restrictions. Military authority supersedes civic authority. State control of the media. State control of reproductive rights. Open expression of religious belief is either a social taboo or flat-out illegal. If I had to pick a dystopia it would probably be this one because as a military veteran myself I could fit in to the mindset well enough and even personally thrive in it, even if I don\u2019t wholly agree with the policies of such a state, or with the pointless and never-ending aggression of continually directing the war machine against The Bugs. I would have to keep my religious belief \u201cin the closet\u201d as well. It would still be pretty awful, given my real-world appreciation for things like democracy and social justice, but I could make a decent go of it for myself if I was looking out only for my own well-being.

            "answer_text": "Funny thing: Everyone has a different idea of what constitutes \u201cdystopian\u201d. You haven\u2019t specified who this is dystopian in the eyes of; this varies depending on viewpoint. You\u2019ve also not precluded choosing our station in this world. This being the case, this arguably comes down to a simple question of what fictional universe I might like to live in- so long as the universe itself is well-known enough to have avid \u201cenemies\u201d in the nerd world. Which is \u201ca thing\u201d, actually. This being the case, I would probably choose to live as a wealthy, well-to-do heir in the world of Sesame Street, Barney, or Arthur, on the technicality that some edgy Dorito-addicted Comedy Central/Adult Swim fanboy somewhere here in \u2018Murica probably views these settings negatively, in contrast to the crude adult cartoons he\u2019d like to live in. In these wonderfully friendly, pleasant, and enlightened places, I could find a happy, comfortable life, with little fear of oppression or other interference. Another possibility is to live in places that are actually somewhat dystopic, although little enough that I would still be relying on the aforementioned technicality of the unknown adult cartoon fanboy\u2019s opinion. For worlds that fall under this category, one more yet comes to mind: The world of Pokemon; ideally for my purposes as portrayed in the first several seasons of the anime, or failing this, in the composite game universe; not sure what region I\u2019d start in though.  This, arguably, is a very dystopian world. Almost every facet of culture and life is centered around anomalously powerful animals, the practice of taking them from their wild homes and indoctrinating them to obey one\u2019s every command, and making them fight each other to unconsciousness and claiming money and glory for their victories. All this, while more practical facets of life, such as human-centric and otherwise non-Pokemon-related job titles and education are conveniently kept out of reach and seldom, if ever mentioned. I realize as I type this that I may not even need the Dorito monkey for this one. Dystopian as this world is, there\u2019s a lot for a person to gleam off of it. Innumerable free social services (Pokemon Centers); easily-attained, renewable resources (Berries); food which somehow are far more nutritious in this world than they are in real life (assorted items that aren\u2019t able to ; readily-accessible information on key elements of the universe and studies thereupon (via the Pokemon Professors and Labs); and a world of very naive people who\u2019ll readily welcome the help of strangers, which gives me plenty of opportunities in currying favors with well-to-dos- which is good, since getting a job in a world where any passerby will jump in and help lift something for free will be really difficult. Just on this alone, I could probably come to attain a very healthy position in the Pokemon world, with a roof over my head, a full pantry, and time and resources to spare for recreation and introspection. If I can court someone particularly powerful, like a Gym Leader, I could even get to a level of living comparable to upper-middle class in the modern real-world. All this isn\u2019t even counting the elephant in the room: The Pokemon themselves. These are animals capable of whimsically accomplishing feats of power and convenience that render technology a minuscule concern. Imagining myself buying into the craze of using these, suddenly countless new possibilities open up. If I need to see in the dark, I can rent a Pikachu and have it illuminate even the darkest place so I can read my paper and bang rocks together. If I need something heavy lifted, I can go rent a Machoke and have it move every box in my house without breaking a sweat. If I decide I want to visit a restaurant or a store somewhere on the other side of the nation, I can rent a Pidgeot to fly me there in a matter of minutes. If I want to go deep-sea fishing, searching for small islands and treasures therein, and/or simply enjoy the blue open ocean, I can rent a Lapras and ride out to the horizon with no fear of the waves. The possibilities for getting where I need to go and getting done the things I want to get done are endless- and of course, with all this power at my disposal, survival ceases to be an issue, and I can start getting really ambitious. I\u2019m tempted to go into further detail, and in particular move on to if I decided to start capturing and raising Pokemon for myself, and yet from here onto if I started getting into battling them. However, I don\u2019t want to let out too much; I think the point is made. Whether it\u2019s a PBS show or Pokemon, each of these would allow me to start to focus on redesigning my circumstances and reconnecting with my inner self- and moving on to higher ambitions. Pokemon in particular provides the resources for the latter. All this, I might add, with the benefit of no longer aging, as most fans of these shows can testify. ",
