            "answer_text": "Not likely. I\u2019ve spent the last several years living in a rural community in Tennessee where I was 15 miles away from the nearest Walmart, let alone anything else. Having lived my entire life in major metropolitan areas, I developed a whole new appreciation of the differences between Walmart and Amazon as well as their strengths. For those living in rural communities, Walmart is the one stop store for nearly anything. For us, it was a weekly trip for everything from cat food, paper towels, groceries, clothes, light bulbs, you name it. Lowe\u2019s and Aldi were next door, so a single trip on a Sunday morning handled just about everything we needed. At the same time, Amazon Marketplace and Amazon Prime were a godsend. My wife has asthma so buying unscented shampoos and deodorants was a must, and Walmart simply didn\u2019t carry them. We also used Amazon for items that we needed regularly but found were often out of stock at Walmart- like my wife\u2019s specific brand of contact lens solution. But not everything we needed was available on subscribe and save, and in many cases Amazon wasn\u2019t less expensive. Even while we were getting Amazon shipments several times a week, I could not imagine replacing all of our shopping with Amazon and never going to Walmart for whatever we needed every week (and to be clear - I hated the Walmart shopping experience, as did my wife.) Case in point - last years flu season. The closest store to us is a Dollar General. My wife is an asthmatic, and respiratory illnesses are really hard on her. To add to the fun, she is allergic to sucralose so we need to use specific brands of cold/allergy medication as well as cough medicine as many common brands contain sucralose. This was our local Dollar General last flu season:  The medication section was absolutely cleaned out. So was the small local pharmacy, and the grocery store, and the Walgreens and CVS that are even further away than Walmart. Our saving grace was the local 24 hour Walmart. There are many things I love about Amazon, but there is no way 2 day shipping is going to cover everything a family needs. There a million last minute things that come up in a week that you may not be able to wait for. And I don\u2019t always need everyday items (like cat food) in the bulk size Amazon wants me to order to justify the free shipping. For rural families, you still need to groceries, fresh produce, clothes, school supplies, and other items. You will wind up going to, or driving past, a Walmart anyway. Plus, when you live in a rural area you\u2019re often dying to get out of house. A trip to \u201ctown\u201d is part of the weekend agenda. Hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Doubtful. Walmart spends alot of money trying to stay relivent. In fact a few region vise presidents have told me, failure to adapt and change is dear to a business. See sears Kmart. Walmart pushed reqlly hard for in store and home grocery pick up and delivery. Walmart.com | Save Money. Live Better. has a huge selection of products like Amazon does. Plus a few thousand of locations to return online orders if ur not happy with it. Online shopping is great, need a screwdriver to finish a project, or custom mixed paint for you kitchen? Even if same day delivery was a thing it probably take four hours to get your screwdriver, what if usps drops your paint? Speaking of paint I ran hardware for years. The first thing both my pain reps said is computer screens to not accurately display colors alot of the time. There is actually alot of effort in making the paint chips look like the finished product. Do you need to know how to use the dry wall patch kit you order? Yea post a question on Amazon and wait a few hours. All my associates knew how to, I made sure of it. Someone will probably mention prices \u2018Amazon is cheaper\u2019 I hate to tell you but Amazon and Walmart comp each other (price match if something is 50 at walmart its 50 at Amazon.). I know this because I priced checked hundreds of items, most of the time. If you bought a mdv-50 blu-ray player at walmart it was very similar in price to. Amazon. The major expections being the holidays on video games and accessories. Even then Amazon will mark down a game to like $46, a few days later you could buy the same game for the same price, but Walmart would also mark down controllers too. The back and forward price roll back would continue for a while. The only reason why Amazon is cheaper is its massive selection. Need a laptop charger walmart has two universal chargers. Amazon has donzes of universal ones, plus hundreds of ones for specific models. Like I said if you compare the same items they are pretty close. But Walmart also has a huge selection of things online, some with free 2 day shipping of you spend more Than $X, I even saw something about overnight shipping last time I opened the app. TLDR Some things are just more convenient or need asap Some times you need help or don't know exactly what you need. Prices are pretty close. Free. Shipping with out paying for Prime. Many more locations to return at walmart. Although you can return items at Khols for Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more ",
