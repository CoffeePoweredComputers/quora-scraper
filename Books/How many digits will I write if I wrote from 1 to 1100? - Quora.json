Many more elegant ways to do this on a computer, but for me this is visually easier to understand. For each single digit number add 1 to the count of digits, for each two digit number add 2 to the count of digits, for each 3 digit number add 3 to the total, and finally for each 4 digit number add 4. I suppose the pen and paper calculation could go something like this. The one \u201ctrap\u201d I see is the [...] notation means the range is inclusive so [1\u20135] means 1,2,3,4,5 [1\u20139] is 9 numbers and 9 digits [10\u201399] is 90 numbers and 90*2 digits [100\u2013999] is 900 numbers and 900*3 digits [1000\u20131100] is 101 numbers and 101*4 digits 9+(90*2) + (900*3) + (101*4) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 404 = 3293 #include <stdio.h>\u00a0#include <stdlib.h>\u00a0\u00a0#define ONE_DIGIT_PER_NUMBER    1\u00a0#define TWO_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER   2\u00a0#define THREE_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER 3\u00a0#define FOUR_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER  4\u00a0\u00a0int main(int argc, char **argv) {\u00a0\u00a0    int count = 0;\u00a0    int i = 0;\u00a0\t//counts from numbers 1 - 9\u00a0    for(i=1;i<10;i++) {\u00a0        count+=ONE_DIGIT_PER_NUMBER;\u00a0    }\u00a0\t//counts from numbers 10-99\u00a0    for(i=10;i<100;i++) {\u00a0        count+=TWO_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER;\u00a0    }\u00a0\t//counts from numbers 100-999\u00a0    for(i=100;i<1000;i++) {\u00a0        count+=THREE_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER;\u00a0    }\u00a0\t//counts from numbers 1000-1100\u00a0    for(i=1000;i<1101;i++) {\u00a0        count+=FOUR_DIGITS_PER_NUMBER;\u00a0    }\u00a0\t//prints total: 3293 to the screen\u00a0    printf(\"total: %d\\n\",count);\u00a0\u00a0    return 0;\u00a0}\u00a0",
