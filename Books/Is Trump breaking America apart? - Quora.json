            "answer_text": "Not really, if you said is Biden breaking America apart you\u2019d still be missing half the question. People are dividing, not because of trump but because he\u2019s the other half of the political party. Half the county hates trump and half the country hates Biden, the hate that we the people have is what is breaking America apart. Trump isn\u2019t ordering blacks to go to separate schools or anything remotely like that, he just makes decisions that a certain percent of people disagree with. Now I\u2019m no trump fan but fuck Biden, if it\u2019s bad now imagine having the president and Vice President taking away your gun rights or at the very least heavily heavily restricting them. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll see America falling apart when the people are literally fighting for their rights. Hope to see you on the good side, stay safe\u270c\ud83c\udffc ",

            "answer_text": "He\u2019s undermined institutions in a very cynical way. Confidence in government and politics has always been tenuous. People just don\u2019t want to admit that the government is a reflection of themselves while also being their only social voice. He is also very indicative of the fact that the executive branch has too much power and can function in a highly undemocratic fashion due to the electoral college. The Senate already exists to give small states parity, but giving them twice the power is not sustainable. Trump has exposed what many of us realized for a long time, that the checks and balances require someone to actually commit to them on a consistent basis. ",
