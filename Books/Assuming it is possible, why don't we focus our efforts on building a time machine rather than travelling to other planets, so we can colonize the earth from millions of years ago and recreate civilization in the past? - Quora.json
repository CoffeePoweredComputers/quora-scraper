            "answer_text": "OPQ: Why don't we focus our efforts on building a time machine rather than travelling to other planets, so we can colonize the earth from millions of years ago and recreate civilization in the past? one: Ask Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk. In the fictional world of Star Trek, his warp-speed slingshot maneuver around the sun could project his ship forward or backward in time, no doubt depending on the polarity of the time-like fields around the ship, which is a bit of meaningless technobabble that I just composed myself. two: In the real world, there is no realistic prospect of you or me traveling backward in time. You Can't Travel Back in Time, Scientists Say three: But let us suppose that we could take refuge in the past, more-or-less as depicted in the TV series Terra Nova. Terra Nova (TV series) - Wikipedia If we tried to colonize the past before humanity\u2019s arrival, we would have to send probes back first so that we could be immunized against diseases that haven\u2019t existed (relative to our own era) for geologic lengths of time. Any one of these diseases could kill every last colonist since they would be virtually alien to the immune systems of any modern creature. So let\u2019s say that we are immunized against all the diseases of the past. This still leaves us with one of the oldest problems with time-travel scenarios: causal paradoxes. Suppose we send a people and equipment back in time to create a colony at the time of the dinosaurs. If this colony blossomed into a civilization, it could kill off a lot of fauna, just as we are doing now. This could alter evolution in ways that would prevent humans from coming into being and creating time machines.** Suppose that we altered the course of evolution by exposing the creatures of the past to our germs. If the right mammalian species were wiped out by the many versions of the modern common cold, our species might not come into being later, preventing the construction of the time machine. But even if 21st century humans managed to perfect time travel into the past, our Mesozoic civilization would probably use up all the fossil fuel and a host of other resources. The actual Cenozoic (or Anthropocine?) civilization would thus be starved for industrial resources by the time it arrived. We might not have enough resources to construct our time machine. ** If there were, thus, no time machine, then we never went back into the past, which would mean that the past was unaffected by us, which would mean that nothing would stop us from building the time machine, which would mean that there was a time machine \u2026 and so on. tl;dr: Sending intact people and equipment back into the past is probably impossible. Even if it weren\u2019t, our impact on the Mesozoic world would probably rob the present civilization of many resources, and might even create causal paradoxes. ",

The knowledge base required to do what you suggest, doesn\u2019t exist on a level large enough for a \u201cwe\u201d to take action. Second of all, the knowledge base that does exist, that I know of, is focused on personal salvation and not reestablishing civilization a million years ago. I\u2019ve written on this premise before, and if the new approach to practical time travel proves feasible, as all indicators so far suggest, there is no motivation to share it with the powers that be, just to provide a means to reestablish civilization in the past. Just like those two Silicon Valley billionaires trying to escape what they believe to be a simulated universe, those of us working on practical time travel are doing it to save our own back sides, especially since the overwhelming corruption and government ineptitude would shut down any efforts to work with them unless the world was threatened by an extinction level event. If you want to know what is really going on in the field of scientific time travel research, instead of the outdated opinions of science fiction fans, geeks and wannabe armchair physicists who wouldn\u2019t know a Cauchy horizon from a Riemann slit, read Marshall Barnes's answer to Why can't we make a time machine?.

            "answer_text": "If you built a working time machine, it would definitely allow FTL travel as well as terraforming other planets in the distant past, which would probably be a lot safer than risking making the Earth uninhabitable millions of years before humans arose or otherwise radically altering history. If the time machine creates a parallel universe without altering the existing time-line, then that\u2019s going to be a one way trip until you come up with something more advanced than a time machine that allows travel between alternate universes. Also, it is foolish to assume something is possible when it probably isn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have to assume that space travel is possible, we already know it is. And even if time travel is possible, we\u2019re more likely to discover it by experiments that can\u2019t be done on Earth for various reasons. So you can think of space exploration as research into the possibility of time travel with a side-benefit of possible exploration and eventual colonization of space in case the time travel thing never works out.

There is a simple explanation. The time traveler would have to build his machine today in order to come back to this time. You cannot go back farther than the day you built the machine. The only real possibility of time travel occurs near black holes as time slows down the closer you get to the event horizon. Since the closest black hole to us is Sagittarius A*, pronounced Sagittarius A star, which is 26,000 light years from us it is impossible with today's technology to build anything that would warp spacetime and slow you down to enable your traveling.
