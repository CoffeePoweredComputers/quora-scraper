            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not quite straightforward to answer. It\u2019s a bit murky. Santa Claus is a bit of a conglomerate of different sources. Saint Nicholas of Myra is in there somewhere, and as an early Christian bishop, there\u2019s certainly some christianity in there. But there are other sources, including (quite likely, but not easy to prove due to the propensity of early Christian writers to suppress pre-christian \u201cevil\u201d information), early Germanic deities. Here\u2019s some information fro the great Oracle Wikipedia: Santa Claus - Wikipedia So there is a bit of christianity there, but most likely a lot of other stuff also. Bit of a mess, to be honest. Yes, I know he\u2019s fictional. I actually prefer Terry Pratchett\u2019s Hogfather as a figure, because he represents the raw brutal forces of nature. Santa always struck me as a bit weird. I mean, what\u2019s with wanting small kids to sit on his knee all the time and the \u201cHo ho ho\u201d? Also, what does he feed his Reindeer to make them fly? Whatever it is, I seriously doubt it\u2019s legal. Question: Is Santa a Christian? ",
