            "answer_text": "I think it is. If you're looking for pure lust or pure action, then this might not be the series for you, but if you're looking for a coming of age story about a girl finding out where she fits in the world and how she relates to her friends and family and how her relationships with said friends and family bolster her or hurt her in terms of how she reacts with the outside world, then you might consider these books. The Twilight Saga is a coming of age story told from the unique perspective of a blank slate protagonist. It has some lovely and truly historically accurate information on the Pacific Northwest and on the Quileute Tribe (who happen to be the tribe responsible for the enduring myth of the thunderbird and whale, as well as many other allegories, which Meyer touches on really beautifully in her own imaginative way in these books). To understand why Twilight is a good series, however, I think it is important to understand why it is so widely disliked. The Twilight Saga movies, while some of the casting decisions were absolutely brilliant, suffered from lackluster writing and poor editing. I think that people equate the movies and the books in a nearly interchangeable way that I don't think I've ever seen before when it comes to the cultural zeitgeist. I don't know of any other series of books made into movies that seem to be discussed as interchangeably as the Twilight Saga books and movies are. I also think that one of the reasons it's so en vogue to hate Twilight, whether we're talking about the books or the movies, is simple misogyny\u2014and I don't just mean by men\u2014I mean the type of internalized misogyny embraced by women. Anything \"girly\" (having to do with a teenaged female protagonist who is in touch with her feelings in this case) is frowned upon, culturally speaking. We're moving away from that cultural paradigm bit by bit, but the stigma from back in 2005\u20132013 when the Twilight Saga was at its peak still seeps into how we look back at it today. Along those same lines, I happen to believe that there's a certain r/notlikeothergirls level of foolishness in play here. Women are taught from a young age, and we begin to reinforce and teach each other, that being in deep contact with our feelings, being emotionally connected and raw are undesirable traits. These traits are linked in an over exaggerated way to teenaged girls (see above), despite teenaged boys and teens of all genders and both sexes being equally emotional and equally without filter at that age. We are taught that when young women are emotional, they're being \"overly dramatic\" or \"silly.\" Hence the vogue of relating to Bella in a critical way\u2014with an eye roll and an air of \"well I'm not like other girls.\" I say there's nothing wrong with being like other girls or like other people in general. It only shows that you are indeed a human being. That, for those of you keeping score at home, ladies and gentlemen, is a good thing. There is also a tendency to be hyper critical of female characters in literature and fiction. For some reason (perhaps at least partially, some of the reasons I explored above) young female protagonists seem to be looked at strictly through the lens of whether they're a \"good role model\" or not. Folks, this is fiction. This is allegory. This is modern myth. It isn't meant to be looked at as if everything a character says or does is a sweeping endorsement for real people to go ahead and start behaving like their fictional counterparts do. There are lots of examples of male and female characters in fiction doing really stupid things or really dangerous things on their hero journeys/journeys to self discovery. That doesn't mean that the author wants their readers to go out and do these things. To this day, I hear people (mainly other women) complaining about how Edward doesn't behave like a realistic, healthy boyfriend to a real young woman and that readers might be moved to begin unhealthy relationships because of this. Folks\u2014I'm an author and I'll be the first to tell you\u2014if you're using fictional characters and the actions of fictional characters to base your lifestyle and decisions on, you have other problems that transcend the bounds of what sorts of fictional books [or movies] you enjoy. That's the way that personality disordered people behave. Real, healthy people who are complete and whole are, thankfully, quite well able to make decisions in life which are not based on what fictional characters do or don\u2019t do. Also, I highly doubt that real boyfriends are going around living for hundreds of years and drinking the blood of the innocent, so why we should hold such fictional characters to real world standards is beyond me. But because this series of books [and movies] is about a young woman, the purity police and the \u201cnot like other girls\u201d crowd tend to come out in full force, pitchforks in hand. I happen to think that Bella is a unique and engaging character. And while Edward\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t what real, healthy, well adjusted human boys should or would do, it isn\u2019t meant to be. Edward is a vampire, thus, he behaves like a vampire would behave. I think it\u2019s interesting that Stephenie Meyer came out with such an interesting twist on a rather dated mythological archetype too. She has created a rich and multi textured world where ancient, diamond skinned vampires roam both the world of day and night; where ancient vampire families and clans feud both from medieval European castles and from modern, Western mansions vie against shape-shifters, half-bloods, werewolves and others for control of the supernatural world\u2014and sometimes the humans in it. I think that the idea that Edward\u2019s, Billy\u2019s, the various nomads\u2019 and the Volturi\u2019s dualistic worldview of black and white; good and evil; light and dark are challenged and eventually shaken up by characters like Bella, Jacob and Carlisle who introduce some really unique and beautifully multilayered shades of gray. I like that love, living authentically and making the choices that are right, despite what tradition or culture mandates are themes within this series. Despite being one of the rare forms of the blank slate protagonist, Bella doesn\u2019t back down. She doesn\u2019t compromise her own integrity or her right to seek happiness and contentment by acquiescing to the wishes of those around her, as well-meaning as they may be. Bella is strong. She owns her own emotions, and she literally molds herself into the woman she wants to become, cutting a path for herself and her family that is unheard of and completely revolutionary in the world in which she lives. I also hear a lot about Jacob being a \u201cNice Guy\u201d and Edward being an abusive boyfriend. I simply don\u2019t think that either Jacob or Edward are either of those things. Jacob is very upfront with Bella about his feelings for her as they develop. Sure he makes mistakes and is going through his own crises and his own personal development, but he\u2019s not a Nice Guy (see: r/niceguys). And Edward agonizes over Bella\u2019s safety, making it a priority and letting Bella know upfront what\u2019s going on, where he stands and how he feels, and leaving Bella room to figure out what she thinks and how she feels about all of that. There\u2019s a lot of talk about how creepy it is that Edward watches Bella sleep at night. Look, guys, he\u2019s a freakin\u2019 vampire. He\u2019s not supposed to be 100% cute and cuddly. The differences between him and Bella personally and the vampire and human species at large need to be made clear, and that is one consistent way that Stephenie Meyer has been sure to do that. Savvy readers will pick up on the fact that Edward is quite upfront and honest about all of this with Bella, even letting her know that if she would prefer private time at night, she is welcome to signal that to him by keeping her window closed, and that if she does so, he will respect her wishes and leave her alone. He\u2019s always very careful to make sure that Bella has a say in what\u2019s going on. He doesn\u2019t force himself on her and he doesn\u2019t manipulate her (except when he foolishly tries to convince her of an emotional lie for her own safety in one of the books in the series\u2014an action he comes to regret deeply and apologize for profusely, working through the issue with Bella in the next few books). I think the Twilight Saga is a fun, entertaining, beautifully written modern story. It has such a rich tapestry of characters and plot points and historical fiction woven into historical truth. If you don\u2019t read it, you may be missing out. It really is more than just a teenage love story, though there would certainly be nothing wrong with it if it were just that\u2014a teenage love story. I give it a 5/5 on plot, character development, setting and narrative, and a 4/5 for some relatively minor editing mistakes which may or may not lie with the publishing company, rather than Stephenie Meyer herself. I also highly suggest reading the anniversary edition of \u201cTwilight,\u201d the first book in the Twilight Saga. It has some extended, never-before-read interactions between Edward and Bella, and it contains a beautiful gender bending re-telling of the story from the first book in the series, from the perspective of a young man called Beau Swan and an immortal vampire names Edythe Cullen. There is also a fantastic little vignette in the Twilight series, called \u201cThe Short Second Life of Bree Tanner,\u201d who happens to be a character from Eclipse (book three in the Twilight Saga). It is a charming and heartbreaking story that I was absolutely fascinated to read! ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 hmm. \u201cIs Twilight worth reading\u201d? That\u2019s an interesting question, and I\u2019m not really sure how to answer. I think it depends on why you want to read it. As a vampire novel: No. There are lots of vampire books out there that are leagues better. I confess, I was really surprised when I read Twilight and it wasn\u2019t at all what I expected. I knew it was the codifier for the entire supernatural romance genre, so I expected lots of kissing under the moonlight and turning into bats. I don\u2019t know, I guess I just wanted it to be more gothic than it was. My biggest problem with Twilight was how its vampires seemed to lack any sensuality or nocturnal enchantment. Sarah McLean's answer to Why is Twilight so heavily criticized? That\u2019s just my own taste. Maybe my perspective will change after I read Midnight Sun. As a romance novel: Maybe. This is a tossup. For some people, the romance in Twilight really works for them. For me, it didn\u2019t. I kept expecting there to be a magical moment when I would really fall in love with Edward and start rooting for him and Bella, but it never really happened. There was never any heat. I didn\u2019t perceive any real chemistry or sensuality or passion between them, nothing that made it feel like love to me. But that might just be me! It seems as though a lot of other readers found Twilight to be an ideal romance. Maybe becuase they saw themselves in Bella, or because they felt like the lack of heat took some of the pressure off. Idk. This one really just depends on what you like in romance novels. As a cultural phenomenon: Yes. You can\u2019t deny that Twilight has had a massive impact over culture and literature in general, and if you\u2019re interested in how and why it got popular, or plan to make any similar media yourself, then it\u2019s definitely worth looking into. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a fascinating case. For entertainment: Sure! I remember Twilight being decently entertaining. Even if the romance didn\u2019t grab me, there was enough in there that was exciting and interesting enough to keep me engaged (which is saying a lot considering how long it was). Looking back, I think the writing was only okay, but that\u2019s fine if all you want is to enjoy reading something. So, honestly, it comes down as to whether you think it\u2019s worth your time. I thought it was worth mine because I\u2019m writing something similar, and I wanted to top it. ",
