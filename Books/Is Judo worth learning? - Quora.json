            "answer_text": "After rediscovering the sport at age 40, after a 25+ years hiatus, I would say absolutely. But again, this all depends on what you are looking for in learning a martial art. Personnally, after 5 years of progressively more intense training (now training 4\u20135 hours a week), I am more fit, more flexible, and stronger than I ever was in my adult life. I still have more belly fat than I would like, but my BMI did improve noticeably. Just learning to break a fall without injury (or minimizing injury depending on the surface) is worth it in my opinion. And it also improves your balance, by both making you more aware of it, and knowing how to move to maintain or recover your balance; I believe I am actually less likely to trip and fall now than before. I wasn\u2019t particularly looking for self defense training for myself, but as a father of two daughters, I can see the potential benefits of judo for self defense: being able to handle a (possibly) larger opponent who tries to grab you, throwing them to the ground and possibly control them, and also how to free yourself from someone trying to hold you down (thanks to ne waza, or ground work). Both of my daughters (7 and 9) have started last year and like it so far. I will of course encourage them to continue for as long as they want to. ",
