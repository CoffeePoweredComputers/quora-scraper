            "answer_text": "You could potentially make some money, but chances are far higher that you will \u201cblow up\u201d and wipe yourself out trading penny stocks. Not worth it. It is important to understand how an illegal \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme works, to avoid getting suckered into it. Here\u2019s what \u201cpump-and-dumpers\u201d do: step 1 they buy shares of very low-priced, thinly traded stocks, step 2 they spread false or misleading information to pump up the price (or pay somebody else to do this for them, to create a smokescreen around their identity). There\u2019s no guarantee for a \u201cpump and dumper\u201d that his misleading information gets picked up and spread around social media and chatrooms. If it doesn\u2019t, he just writes another piece of misleading information and hopes that that one will work. If it does work, then they go to step 3: they dump the shares once the price peaks. Big gains for the \u201cpump-and-dumpers\u201d (buy low and sell high, with an illegal high that you created yourself), big losses for unsuspecting investors that fell into the trap. Some penny stock traders try to outsmart \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes, and use the penny stock promoter alerts for more than just entertainment purposes. Step 1 sign up for penny stock alerts, step 2 watch the stock go up and \u201cshort sell\u201d at the peak. Short selling involves borrowing shares from somebody else, selling those, and buying shares at a later stage to close out the borrowing position. Step 3 buy back the stock once it drops, close the short position. Basically, these penny stock traders try to sell high and buy low, making money riding the downward wave of the \u201cpump and dump\u201d pattern. There is a big risk involved here, which is the second half of step 2: how do you short sell at the peak? First of all, as these are thinly traded shares, there might not be enough shares (or even ANY shares) available to go short. Second, how do you know (except with the benefit of hindsight) that the share price reached the peak? You may not get to step 3 if the share price continues to rise after you took a short position. You might even be facing an unlimited loss on your short position, get a margin call from your broker, or blow up altogether.  ",

            "answer_text": "99% of the time, no. I used to dabble in penny stocks, but then I learned some facts which helped me understand why so many lose money to penny stocks. Most popular penny stocks end up diluting shareholders to zero. This is because they raise money using the stock, but their business plan is basically fake. And they always need more money.Almost anyone can make a penny stock. Add a company webpage, some over-hyped buzzwords like \u201cinternet of things\u201d or \u201cAI\u201d or \u201ccannabis\u201d, etc, buy a press release or two, and suddenly the worthless shares only you are able to print have value. Pay yourself an enormous salary as a board member of the penny stock and enjoy making a ton of money with almost no effort.Bid/Ask spread is a non-avoidable transaction cost of penny stocks and is often 5% per trade. This means if you trade ten times in a row, you on average have lost 40% of your wealth.Penny stocks are impossible to short. Either the borrow fees are enormous because everyone knows its a scam, or there simply aren\u2019t any shares available to short because nobody is holding onto the stock long enough.If you don\u2019t believe me, you haven\u2019t been in the penny stock game long enough. It is not a game you can win. The only people who win are the founders of the penny stock, and the accredited investors who do backdoor death spiral financing. In other words, most penny stocks are a casino. The casino operators are the founders. They cannot lose, and you will. ",
