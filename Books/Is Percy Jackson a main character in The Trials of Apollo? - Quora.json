            "answer_text": "No, he isn\u2018t. Apollo, turned into human by Zeus, is the main character in this spin off series. In his journey to have his godly status back, he meets several known and loved characters from PJO and HOO, but none of them actually play the protagonist. Percy does make an appearence in the first book, but all that I remember of that is he showing how much he doesn\u2018t want to be involved in whatever the Hades Apollo in going throught. He does help him getting to Camp Half Blood, tho. Guess he just wants to be left alone after two Odissey-like quests to save the world\u2026 I believe he\u2018ll be back for a cameo in the last book, Tower of Nero, as I believe most of other characters we saw on Apollo\u2018s quests will.

            "answer_text": "Not quite. Percy has already had plenty of page-time in both the first and second series, serving as the sole narrator in PJO and a part-time narrator in 3 books in HoO. In ToA, he has gone into semi-retirement and has so far only appeared in the first book. He might make an appearance in the finale, but I doubt he would play a major enough role to be qualified as a \u201cmain character\u201d. ",
