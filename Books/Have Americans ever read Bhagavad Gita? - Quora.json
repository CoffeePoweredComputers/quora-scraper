            "answer_text": "It is difficult for me to say because I have not been in much touch with American people. But coming to point, if at all they want to read Bhagvad Gita, they would require to add some words in the dictionary. for example, There are no separate words for \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e, \u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e, \u0908\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930, \u091c\u0940\u0935 \u0964 in English dictionary. Soul, consciousness, universal consciousness etc are words but they don't convey the exact meaning of what sanskrit words mean. \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f is translated as nature but Bhagvad Gita has more expansive meaning than simply nature. \u0915\u092e\u0945 is translated as action but in indian philosophy, any modifications in material things \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 is form of \u0915\u092e\u0945. Even thinking and speaking also are \u0915\u092e\u0945 Finally, environment, culture, sanskars \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 etc also play important role in understanding Bhagvad Gita with correct meaning and then follow it in real life. Even if they read Bhagvad Gita, they will be intellectually rich but whether they will follow it or not is uncertain. forget Americans, even in India and in Hindu families,very few have read and out of those few, how many have understood it's exact purport is doubtful.
