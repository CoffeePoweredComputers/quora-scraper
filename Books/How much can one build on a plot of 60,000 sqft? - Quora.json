            "answer_text": "How much can one build on a plot of 60,000 sqft? It\u2019s going to depend on the local building regulations and codes, as well as zoning. Where I live, a house has to be set back something like 100\u2032 from the front of the lot. (Note that\u2019s from the front of the lot, not the street. So if you have a lot shaped like an \u2018L\u2019 with the top part connected to the street, the \u201cfront\u201d is along the street, but also on the part parallel to the street.) Setbacks from the back and sides are 25\u2032. (A setback is an area near a boundary or line that cannot be built on.) I used to live in the city, before moving out to the less developed area nearby. In the suburban area I lived in, setbacks were 25\u2032. In other areas of the city, setbacks were less than 10\u2032. So the largest size of the building is going to depend on the zoning regulations for where the lot is. If you\u2019re trying to work all this out, call the zoning and planning office and ask them for any setbacks and restrictions for the address or location of the lot. They\u2019ll be glad to go over all that with you. Be aware that if you\u2019re in the U.S. and the property is near wetlands, you also have to be aware of wetlands regulations and any RPAs (Resource Preservation Areas) and setbacks from those. (For instance, we have a creek and the wetlands boundaries are within a few feet of the creek. The RPA extends 100\u2032 from the wetlands and there\u2019s a 25\u2032 setback from the edge of the RPA, so the closest we could build to the creek is 125\u2032. (But we could put a driveway or patio in that 25\u2032 setback - just not the house.) ",
