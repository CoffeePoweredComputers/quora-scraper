Someone who has never trained before should steer clear of Beach Body routines since they can actually be pretty intense (and Insanity is known for its cardio). I would advise not touching them for at least a few months after starting your own training. I think most of them also come with a suggestion of 1 year, but it really us up to you to try. If you define yourself as a beginner it would definitely get you some results (especially if you make sure to follow the diet plan) but you'll probably hate it if you are really all that new to training.
