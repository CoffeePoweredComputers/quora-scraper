            "answer_text": "Without a doubt! :) I\u2019m 18 and dating a lover, a man who is in his 40\u2019s. The best decision I've ever made in life. He\u2019s very masculine but also loving to me. Being a mature women yes, this can happen but there are things to know about maturity to such a man. I knew after sometime with an older Man that all the attention seeking habit I had as a little child was never to be done with this Man. Many young Women aren't aware of this, that these Men have lived life already, experiencing all the tricks and fools many Women make. Yes, if attraction is there he will get interested but as soon as you show that your just in need for the drug of attention seeking he\u2019ll be running for the hills. It\u2019s a game that they don\u2019t want to play so leave the nonsense in the past. The negative talk we all did in Middle school up to High School about our Ex- Boyfriends, crushes ( which is SOOO immature), to even everything about every meal we ate that day is a no. No negative output, only positive. Older Men, don\u2019t want any negativity and all the things you talk about as a teen. They've lived through that already. They are not going to chase you down if you don\u2019t show attraction, interest or love. If you push over violating their boundaries it\u2019s so easy for them to shut that door and be moving on to someone new. It\u2019s as simple as 123 and the ABC\u2019S. Again, they\u2019ve lived and most men like the Man I'm with are open to telling you exactly what they don\u2019t take. My lover since day 1, I remember him telling me straight off the bat what he\u2019s not having from any young Women. Which I\u2019m glad he discussed with me because if you truly respect someone and want them to feel their best, you stick to these boundaries and respect their wishes. Find out what maturity means to him. Know his boundaries and you\u2019ll be fine but violate his boundaries, act like these girls in school, all attention seeking and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re not as mature as you thought you was. Message me if you want to know more of my experience with dating older men. :) Best Wishes!, Xxx ",

As for developing real love across such an age gap - yes, it\u2019s possible but depends on so many factors. Different factors in each case perhaps. I did develop such a love. When I first met her I assumed she was 7yrs or so older than she actually was because she was very mature for her age. Kinda disappointed to find out later she was younger. But we both got over that and are now married for 8 happy years. I don\u2019t suggest that people should go looking for such relationships however if one happens to find oneself getting on super with someone much younger or older in ways that are emotionally healthy and responsible then don\u2019t let what other people may think stop you from investigating it further.

Unfortunately our society is hugely prejudicial and such relationships are frowned upon mainly through ignorance, jealousy and narrow mindedness. I agree that age could be the age of his daughter but she isn't his daughter and I don't think there is any guilt attached or thoughts in that direction because of the age of the girl. I cannot understand why you think he would feel guilty.  If you travel to Asia you will find many middle aged men with a young pretty bride on their arms. Yes it can happen.   ",
