            "answer_text": "How\u2019s about this title? Tits Up Dead In The Water: The Greatest Film Flop That Never Was. I hate to be the piss in everybody\u2019s beer, but the above question assumes that there will be a future time when people will be game to watch a movie about 2020. Reality check. The year ain\u2019t over yet, we\u2019re factually only halfway through it, so, how is it going to end? Nobody knows. Well, that\u2019s a snag. A film with no discernible end to it. Wow, great, endless hours of film footage with no director yelling \u2018\u2019cut\u2019\u2019. There goes the film budget, right out the window. What film producer in their right mind would want to finance this movie? Reality check. Who is going to be the star attraction in it? All your big box office stars are in isolation. Hollywood is on an extended hiatus. Nobody in Tinseltown is working. I hear Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are looking for employment. Maybe hire them. Oh, I see, you\u2019re not going to have big-name stars, it\u2019s going to have real-life ordinary people in it, everyday Joes and Janes. Well, hate to shock you, but the everyday Joes and Janes don\u2019t need your movie. They are already living in 2020 in real life a day at a time. They are already struggling and coping. Do they need more drama to their lives in a movie about drama? Reel life would be pointless at this juncture. Reel life would pale in comparison to Real life. What is the script going to be? A film has to have a script, some kind of template to work by. You can\u2019t just turn on the cameras and hope something interesting happens in front of the lens unless you\u2019re an Andy Warhol type and you hope your film will screen at the Museum Of Modern Art. How do you coordinate a crew of cameramen, makeup artists, costume and set designers, lighting and sound crews, the whole kit and kaboodle of a film set when everybody is social distancing and wearing masks and applying hand sanitizer every few minutes? How is your film going to get made under those conditions? Who is your target audience? The Cineplex\u2019s and Odeons are closed. Is your movie going straight to Netflix? If it does, who would want to watch it when anybody can read the headlines in newspapers, turn on the radio or the TV or any of the other media and get their fill of 2020, right up to the eyeballs? Who would need your fucking movie? People watch a film to be entertained or informed. What would your film offer that isn\u2019t already on offer? More depression, more stress, more doom, and gloom? So, if a movie about 2020 came out right now, June 2020, the question would be WHY? Isn\u2019t the whole idea dead in the water like a drowned muskrat? Why a film? Would it be a documentary? Would it be a semi-fictional thing with fictional characters? Do people really need a film about 2020 when they are already living it? Real-life is the Reel life. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I'm no film student, but I'm already calling 2020 \u201cThe Terror\". I'm borrowing the title a bit from a couple of television series, \u201cThe Terror\u201d and \u201cThe Terror: Infamy\", however the content is totally unrelated to either show. In my mind's eye, I visualize the realities of attempting to survive a disease that spares no age, race, sex or income bracket, all while witnessing continuing political turmoil and plummeting economic conditions around the world. From the perspective of a young person, seeing the globe crippled by a sickness that even our advanced medical technology cannot yet cure, you begin to doubt your safety. Safety is something taken for granted in most parts of North American societies (although most certainly not everywhere, by any means), and I most definitely took my own safety as a given for much of my life. Now, I find myself writing over and over again in my journal that I am terrified, and there was even a point early on in the pandemic where I composed a last will and testament, something I never expected to have to do at not yet 21 years old. I realized this year that I have no control whatsoever over life and death. Having been gravely suicidal for many years, I fell under the illusion that I had mastered my fate. I could choose each day to live or to die, and that knowledge comforted me. Now, there's another player on the board, one I never expected to have to contend with: contagion. Perhaps that's what frightens me most of all\u2026not being able to control my own ability to keep on living or dying. ",
