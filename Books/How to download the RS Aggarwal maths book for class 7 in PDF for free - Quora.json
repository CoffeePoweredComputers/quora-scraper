            "answer_text": "Using a PDF to study, especially when you have to refer to it repeatedly for a subject like mathematics, can be a bore. I have always found it much easier to use a textbook, and mark questions that I have completed and refer to important or tough ones later. I understand it can be costly to buy a textbook. I have found that the website MyPustak is the best answer it this dilemma. They carry a wide range of books, from all subjects and genres, novels, school textbooks, and in various languages. But the best part?- every book is available for free! You only have to pay shipping charges, which is very cost effective. You can also donate books there. All you have to do is fill up a few forms, package it and they will collect your books right from your doorstep! I hope this helps you. Good luck with math, and keep practicing! ",
