            "answer_text": "Why? I mean, that sounds like the place to start. Why do you want to write a fantasy book? Let\u2019s assume that you do want to write. That your goal isn\u2019t to be someone who has written a book (a very different goal indeed). Because already wanting to write, to get down there in the trenches with that #2 pencil and struggle with language and description and dialog to rescue that story that is somewhere out there, is a solid starting place. Here\u2019s one big, heavy secret that\u2019s no secret at all. Like the Ruby Slippers, the trick is that you won\u2019t believe it until you\u2019ve made the journey yourself. And that is that ideas are over-rated and inspiration is everywhere. When you are a writer, they are everywhere. The ideas don\u2019t make the writer. The writer makes the ideas. Being a writer is having the eyes to see the ideas that are everywhere. And the only way I know to get there is to work out. To practice, endlessly. To write, no matter how uninspired it feels, until you have those tools to see the ideas in the wild and capture them. ",

            "answer_text": "Read. A lot. Read everything you can get your hands on. Start with other fantasy novels. Who are your favorite authors? Start with the popular titles in the genre in which you wish to write. Ask yourself as you read, \u201cWhat makes this book so popular?\u201d \u201cWhy is it selling so well?\u201d \u201cWhat do people like about it?\u201d \u201cWhat makes it good?\u201d After reading a few fantasy novels currently on the market, go back and read some of the fantasy novels of the past. Switch genres and read other books in the sci-fi, mystery, detective, romance, historical fiction, and other genres. Learn what makes a good story. Learn what makes a good character. Learn what makes a good plot. Learn the difference between plot and theme. Don\u2019t just read fiction. Read the newspaper. Read nonfiction. Read some history, biography, memoir, erotica, religious writings, and whatever else you can acquire. To be a good writer, you\u2019ve got to be an avid reader. The more you read, the more you\u2019ll develop a taste for what makes a good and compelling story. After you understand that, you\u2019ll begin to get ideas. The next lesson is to learn how to distinguish between good ideas and bad ideas. ",
