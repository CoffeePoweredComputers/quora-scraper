            "answer_text": "Yes, and the best I have ever had was \u2026 my own. See, food and I have an odd relationship. It likes me, I think, but I\u2019m mostly neutral about it. The same can be said for any sort of physical exertion. It wasn\u2019t always this way, but 20+ years of sitting at a desk in a world contained mostly in one\u2019s head will do that. As a result, I view food as fuel only for the most part - a necessity. Cooking? Pfft. Something I did for others when I was a teen. Long story short, I inadvertently stumbled onto sweet potatoes in general (nutritious and easy to prepare), and the next Thanksgiving, I opted to bake a few pies. It took a few false starts, but I soon remembered what I\u2019d learned decades before, so when I showed up at my then-GF\u2019s place with the two pies I thought were best, I was ushered inside with a few sideways glances, but no real fuss. I forgot all about them in the rush of people to talk with and the mixed drinks to consume, so it was a bit of a shock to hear someone exclaim \u201cOh! This is the best sweet potato pie I have ever had.\u201d. Turns out that it was my GF\u2019s stepmother, and she was three sheets to the wind by then. Still, after that rousing approval, I grabbed a slice for myself, and it was also the best I have ever had. Well, it was the only sweet potato pie I\u2019d ever had, but I did say those two were the best, didn\u2019t I? So that makes two (3?) things I can cook well without fail: Eggs and toast, and sweet potato pie. You have to like everything very well done though, or you\u2019re just the wrong demographic. :) ",

However, I love pumpkin pie. My mom knows I love pumpkin pie. Every year, my parents invite a ton of family members over their house for Thanksgiving\u2026and produce copious amounts of amazing food. Last year was no different. I text my mom asking her if she's made pumpkin pie. She says \u201cOf course\u201d. Great\u2026wonderful\u2026sweet\u2026glorious pumpkin pie. I ate a slice, and yes\u2026it was everything I dreamed of. My mom walks over to me and says, \u201cYou just ate sweet potato pie.\u201d SORCERESS! What witchcraft have you been dabbling in?!? I felt like my own mother had betrayed me. The one thing I hated most at the Thanksgiving dinner table actually tasted delicious to me?!? Thanksgiving has changed forever now. I don't even know who I am anymore. ",
