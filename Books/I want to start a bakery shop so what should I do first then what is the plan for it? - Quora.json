            "answer_text": "Your idea is noble, but too broad. What are your specialties? Breads, cakes, pastries, other? Narrow done the product line, test market some of your goods and see what clients like. While establishing a group of clients and a product line, location scout. Be aware of the competition and proximity. A bakery needs foot traffic and that means a strip mall or business district or hotel(s). Office complex is doable, too. You\u2019ll need to determine a good price point for your items. And of course, the usual: P.R., marketing, accounting, banking, etc. Good luck! ",
