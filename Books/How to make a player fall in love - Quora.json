            "answer_text": " It may not work. It will not be easy to make a player love you. It may not be worth the effort. But, it is possible. It will take time, there is no magic bullet. First, you will have to convince him that you know him, and you love him. Do the following: Point out the good things you know about him. The comical habits, and things he likes, like his favorite drink.Point out the things you do for him. You prepare for for trips. You buy him sox. You check his look. You play catch.Tell him how important your relationship truly is. Why it's important.Make plans together, and stay in contact everyday.Tell him why you're the best, and ask him to stop looking.Players are lonely insecure people. They probably don't want you to know that. They are embarrassed about the number of women they have had it will be in the dozens. Keep the conversation light. A real player will be a bit distant. Hot and cold. You won't realize they are lonely and insecure. You won't always know what they are thinking. It won't be easy, but you will have to convince him that you know him and you love him. Point that out to him. You know him, and love him. You love him for who he is. You are his girlfriend! Be at his side, or within shouting distance almost all the time. No free weekends. If he goes to the gym, you go too. Make long term plans with actual dates. Fill up that calendar. He never makes plans longer than a week away, so you need to do it. Get to know his people. Know his family, friends and coworkers. Point out the strength and need of these relationships. The final, and most difficult thing is to get him to talk. He will resist, but get him to talk. Encourage him to talk about anything. Make him talk about Global Warming if you have to. Keep it light and fun. Encourage him, but dont criticize him. He can't easily accept criticism. Sugar coat it, the way you talk to him is important. He will be a fantastic lover. He has learned a lot over the years. That part will be very good. He will probably have two or three ladies ready to take your place, so it won't be easy. That's my best advice. ",

Probably using you if you don\u2019t live together. There have been honest chicks and dudes that did leave the game, I bet their partners laid it out straight. You fuck up, I\u2019m gone. They said it and meant it so well, the player knew it\u2019s now or never. Pimp/player for life or settle down and play the \u201cdad/ mum -life\u201d game. Don\u2019t fool/ mug/ play yourself though, if you\u2019re suspicious and snoop, it actually pushes a partner to cheat. If you\u2019re suspicious you don\u2019t trust them I\u2019m the first place. Pshh please lol. If you\u2019ve slept together and they haven\u2019t hung up the rod and tackle/ given you the key to the city already and put them somewhat in your pocket/ purse (do they listen to you or ignore little instructions.. if you have no authority\u2026.) you\u2019re never going to.

            "answer_text": "I really don\u2019t like these games that people play. Before I explain this to you, you must understand that a player will eventually play with your feelings and eventually dump you when he will have what he came for (usually sex) so be very careful when being attached to such a person. The best thing you can do if you want to get a player to fall for you is respect yourself and refuse to play his games. Make him appreciate you by setting standards for yourself. Use positive reinforcement to make him see what you're worth. Most importantly, Don't make him a priority. When a player calls to make plans, don't drop everything you're doing just for him. If you have plans, don't cancel them. Let him know that you've got a life outside of him, and that you're going to spend time with your friends. If you cancel on your friends to hang out with him, he'll feel like he already has you, and he may soon lose interest. Either way, my personal opinion is that you should find someone who won\u2019t play games with your feelings, because one of you will eventually get hurt and nothing serious will ever come out of childish games. Never expect a player to have a serious relationship with you. ",

You have players who are hardcore narcissists. Smooth, lying, conniving. Run. You have players who use playing to maintain emotional distance. They're scared. They're a tougher nut to crack. However, you can't say they're not worth it from the distance of a quora commentator. You have no idea how shell shocked he is or how soft his inner state is. Know it's risky, but it's not necessarily insurmountable. You do have to be realistic, however. These guys need to put their big boy pants on and grow up. At the other end of the spectrum, you have players like me. When I'm single, I'm a dating and hookup animal, but I also know a good thing when I see it and I'm willing to commit for the right woman. I'm my case, that includes trans women. She got me. I ain't going nowhere.  Leo Ambrose's answer to Women are attracted to bad boys. How can I act like or be a \"bad boy\"? ",
