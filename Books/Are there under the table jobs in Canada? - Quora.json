It pays good but it is not my main source of income I have a full time job and pay taxes.Under the table jobs are generally easier to find in small towns or rural areas \u2026 small businesses are generally happy for the extra help. Agriculture (planting and harvesting crops) and working with livestock are generally good areas to consider.Other people, like myself, have under the table side jobs. This could be house cleaning, dog walking, lawn care, pool cleaning or doing skilled work like carpentry or computer repairs for cash on the side.I\u2019ve been audited four times in ten years and everything came back fine (no problems) because it is just side work and my on the book job pays my way.
