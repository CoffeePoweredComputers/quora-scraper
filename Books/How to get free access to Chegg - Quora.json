After the date of free subscription is over, they\u2019ll ask you to pay which is quite a lot if you ask. You can look for other alternative apps or websites. I can suggest one such app called \u201cConectsQ&A\u201d. It is a wonderful problem solving app. You can get the answer to your questions just within a few seconds and the answers are given by experienced tutors! You must give it a try. You won\u2019t regret. ",
