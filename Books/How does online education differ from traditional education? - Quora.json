            "answer_text": "In a traditional school you will have a live teacher who instructs you in the subject and can answer your questions and make recommendations on the spot\u2014a person you can develop a human relationship with. Some online schools provide live teachers you can communicate with aver the Internet or by telephone, but many do not. In my opinion, there is no substitute for being taught by a live teacher, face to face, especially if the subject being studied is complicated. But it\u2019s up to the student to decide which method of learning a subject is best for him or her. For some geographically isolated students or disabled students, online courses may be the only way to access an education. If you have a choice, though, I would recommend traditional classroom study. I believe it to be superior to online education. However, online classes can be a good adjunct to traditional classroom study. ",
