            "answer_text": "Not enough. Don\u2019t quit your day job. There are two ways publishers work with authors. One is freelance (work for hire - you give up the right to the material). In this case authors are given a flat one-time payment. That can range from $150 (I say no to those) to thousands. More common in the educational market. Know your worth and how much time is needed to complete the job. Other books are acquired under royalty (you retain the rights to the material). In those cases the publisher will pay you an \u201cadvance\u201d ranging from $1,000 to tens of thousands (average is probably $5k-$10K for a novel). If your book sells more than what is needed to cover the advance, you\u2019ll get a royalty check for the additional earnings (5\u201310% of net or gross sales depending on your contract) every six months. If you write a picture book you will split the royalty with the illustrator. Hint - the majority of authors don\u2019t earn out their royalties, are expected to do a lot of their own marketing and pay for their own travel. So be prepared. But you would have to do the same if you self-published and without the same access to professional resources. Write because you love writing. If you\u2019re planning for large income infusions, it can happen, but it\u2019s rare. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer will greatly vary, depending on your genre, publishing approach and distribution methods. This is a rough breakdown for general authors and writers:  Now if your children\u2019s book is a picture book with illustrations and you hired an illustrator to do the drawing, expect to pay them half of your earnings. Drawing is a tough skill and deserves the pay. If you choose to self-publish, you get the best royalties via Amazon\u2019s KDP program (30\u201370%). You get 100% earnings (minus payment processing) if you publish on your own website. Self-publishing success will depend on your ability to do sales and marketing. If you choose a traditional publisher, expect 5\u201310% royalties, at most. This is why many authors can starve, because of the amount of money publishers take from you. This is why I recommend doing something unique to stand out in the crowded field of authors. Try supplementing your author income with podcasting, YouTube, audiobooks, artwork, merch, speaking engagements\u2026the opportunities are endless to boost your overall salary. The more books you have, the more you can capitalize on repeat business. Most authors think of writing as a job or hobby. In order to make it a career, you have to be the CEO and entrepreneur of your writing empire. ",
