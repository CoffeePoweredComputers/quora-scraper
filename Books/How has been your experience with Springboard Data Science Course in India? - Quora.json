            "answer_text": "For me it has been a great experience given that I could transition into a new job after halfway through the program with a salary that was at par with my skills. To keep it simple, I'll focus on the salient points. The curriculum covers a huge chunk of things you're likely to work on and come across in the workplace. Having said that, some of things learnt are more specific to the kind of industry you're in and the kind of job role you have so you do not need to worry about \u2018missing\u2019 out. There will always be more to learn either way.The assigned mentor is very very helpful. You need to make sure to build a connection with them as they can help you even after graduating. Not only can they help you optimize your code, they can also help in inculcating best practices prevalent in the industry.The career coaches are there to help you even after you graduate for a certain period of time. Make sure to utilize their time judiciously as you want to build a job hunt strategy. Think of job hunting as a process, not just a single step, and you will not be disappointed.Overall, I am certain if you have been careful in curating your journey through the course, it'll be fruitful at the end. Identify and decide your goals from the get-go, be it for knowledge upgrading or job change. For me, it was to switch into a career in analytics and the course was holistic enough to make it happen in 3 months (needless to say, I also had to work my rear off in a short time period). The mentors and career coaches were excellent with rich knowledge about the field and the market so you should be sorted there. ",
