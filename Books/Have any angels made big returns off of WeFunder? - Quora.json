            "answer_text": "Not enough time has passed for investors to make a return since it can take 5-10 years before startups have an exit. But startups that raise on our platform grow and raise more money from VCs later on, giving investors unrealized returns. (That is, their investments are worth more on paper but they're unable to cash out yet.) The most promising company to use Wefunder so far is Zenefits. A $10k investment in them would be worth (roughly) $400k today [1]. That's a very atypical investment, most investments become worthless (diversification is very important). But a very common startup investment strategy is to bet on companies that might become outliers, and if you get lucky and find a Zenefits the return can cover all your loses and then some. In terms of how much equity someone gets for $10k, that's a complicated question to answer because most startups use convertible notes and percent ownership varies so much depending on the current value of the company (and the conditions when convertible notes convert). Usually investors don't pay attention to number of shares when investing $10k \u2013 they buy $10k worth of equity and bet that the value grows. [1] Back in 2013 they were raising at a $9m valuation cap on Wefunder, and in 2014 they raised a Series B round giving them a $550m post-money valuation.
