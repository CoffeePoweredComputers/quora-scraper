            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very realistic, but not in the way you think. Here are a few things to take into account: Public markets work because of the collective liquidity of everyone in the market.Capital begets capital.Compounding isn\u2019t magical, compounding on a massive principal value is magic.Proportions matter.First. Understand a public market. Millions and millions of people trading on a daily basis for an amount of shares you can\u2019t conceive. Some companies are worth loads of money because the sum of all those shares being held in the hands of the public equals whatever amount they\u2019re worth. Other times, you\u2019ll have a company just making it to the market. Some companies make it to the market and then die off temporarily. Think Facebook. They went public at $38 a share.  The initial reaction by those in the market was wrong. Many people thought they wouldn\u2019t last in 2012. A lot of analysts had sell ratings on them. Their share price went to under half for about two years. Then, the believers saturated the market. Early adopters held. Facebook started to turn a profit. People wanted in, but nobody was selling because those who held were adopters unwilling to part ways with a company they knew would be successful from the start. Today, it is nearly ten-fold higher than the bottom it hit in 2012. This is a product everyone uses today. Everyone. Every single person. Let\u2019s take another example.  For a long time, Netflix was very cheap. If we look even ten years farther back, you\u2019ll see lower prices:  50 cents. But more importantly, since the collapse of the dot-com bubble, a lot of people gave up on the internet as a source of economic vitality. Netflix grew regardless. The early collapse of about 6 trillion dollars in the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s signaled distrust to a lot of investors about the development in new markets. Netflix had about 30 million subscribers in 2011. Then, they announced they were going to separate their dvd rental company from their streaming service. Their stock price fell by about 85% to $7 a share from its historic high of nearly $50. The media panicked. Again, people grew distrustful of Netflix\u2019s ability to scale. They thought the end was imminent for them. Netflix has almost 170 million subscribers today. Cable continues to die. YouTube is becoming the platform of choice for the younger generation. People stopped caring about greedy, strict contracts that lock them in for no reason. Simple beginnings. This is also a service everybody was using back then. The difference is that not everybody realized how big it can scale and whether they could also provide original programming in the same capacity that HBO does. Outside a public market, these event horizons would not exist. You couldn\u2019t have a private company fund hundreds of billions of dollars to a company they can\u2019t initially see any value in. The public market offers both the company and the individual investor an opportunity for massive gain at relatively little risk. Netflix\u2019s gain was 40-fold. Even with small investments laid out over a span of a decade, the gain on the stock relative to the risk you took becomes so high that it\u2019s dumb. People still downplay Netflix\u2019s story today. Go figure. Second. This one is equally silly but an important lesson on the principles of capitalism. The more you have, the easier the climb. If you start with $10,000, you\u2019re in a club with a lot of other people. Your decisions have less impact on the overall nature of your investment. If you have $10,000,000, you\u2019re in an exclusive club. Suddenly, your 10% gain looks massive. You begin to think about high-yield stocks in the form of dividends. You stop caring about growth with risk. You can toss little bits of money into Bitcoin or smaller companies because if one of them takes off, you\u2019re looking at great gain relative to the investment size of your total portfolio. A small investment in any of those things is only a tiny portion of your dividend you\u2019ll be receiving each quarter. Equities like IEP offer a 10% dividend currently. Any growth in that company is amazing, but at $10,000,000 in holdings, you\u2019re making stupid money just by holding onto it. If you need that dividend cash, awesome, you will never hit your nest egg. If you don\u2019t need it, well, dividend reinvestment only makes you richer to a dumber degree. The more you have, the harder it is to stop being rich. Unless, of course, you\u2019re insanely uneducated about basic financial principles and you\u2019re trying very hard to become poor again (think celebrities, athletes, random bursts of unanticipated wealth). Third. This is an extension of the story in the second part. If you start with $10,000 and you add $1,000 each month for 40 years to a portfolio that\u2019s generating a return of 6.50% a year, here is what you get:  Key metrics: $10,000 principal.$1,000 per month.6.5% annually that\u2019s compounded monthly.At the end, you would have contributed $480,000 of your own cash. But your money made nearly $2,000,000 in interest over that span of time.This isn\u2019t including if your plan is in a 401(k) that matches to a certain percentage of your paycheck, which can double this amount.But now, imagine something else. What if you have some starting balance that is much higher than this. Let\u2019s say you had a rich uncle who loved you that died unexpectedly. He leaves you a million dollars. Let\u2019s run this thought experiment on that now.  By year 10\u201315, you already have more money than you would have at year 40. At the end, your nest egg is nearly 16 times what you initially had. You contributed a total of $1,480,000 to your portfolio. Your hands off approach did the rest. You did nothing other than place your dead uncle\u2019s cash to good work and pretended like it didn\u2019t exist. Even if you were 25 when you started and you took this money out at the end of 20 years, you would be incredibly wealthy.  Here is an S&P 500 tracking index. It\u2019s Vanguard\u2019s. If you had purchased that million dollars worth at the peak of 2008 before the crash and compared it with the current crash we are having right now, you would have seen an 80% increase in your portfolio. Your net worth would have doubled if you purchased before the crash and compared just after the crash currently. In other words, you would have seen an average of 6.67% annual returns, but it was all realized in the last 6 years of the market. If you didn\u2019t include the current down-turn in the market, your portfolio would have literally doubled. The timing is always irrelevant. The point here is that your principal can matter, how early you start matters, and how frequently you continue to place additional investment matters. Getting rich isn\u2019t hard at all. It\u2019s growing the discipline and practicing patience that humans are terrible at. Fourth. The continuation of the story we are talking about: How much of your salary are you putting away? Your future earnings depend on how disciplined you are today. If you can save 60% of your salary, but you choose to save 20% instead, that 40% difference in your early years has a major impact on how much your future dollars make. Imagine that every dollar you make today is going to be $100 in 15 years. You\u2019d be looking at your money very differently if that were the case. The problem is that people want the earnings now. But that\u2019s not possible. Nobody makes money as soon as they start to save. Additionally, it is likely that once you start investing, you\u2019ll lose money in the near-term. At any timeline, you\u2019ll begin to feel the weight of losing a few thousand dollars and freak out. Maybe you\u2019ll sell. As you\u2019ve seen in any of the charts for any duration of time, markets always win.    Here is the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the span of a hundred years. The first one is inflation adjusted, the second chart is inflation adjusted and in logarithmic scale, and the third one is just in linear, non-inflation adjusted nominal dollars. In any case, with any lens, at any perspective, and with any angle, the market wins. Even with this downturn, the future will be bright. In the next decade to two decades, those who placed their faith in good companies will continue to reap the benefits of adopting early. Those with large proportions of investments will benefit the most. Those who regularly invest large proportions of their salary will benefit the most. Those who practice discipline and patience more often than not will benefit the most.  The bottom line is that getting rich off investing isn\u2019t a matter of how. It\u2019s a matter of when you begin and how much you choose to put toward it. Time will kill your opportunity as soon as possible. It won\u2019t wait for you to make a decision about when to start. Time has no patience for indecision. The younger you are, the more powerful your dollars will work. It\u2019s at later stages of life that you can\u2019t have the risk of the economy turning downward when you only have $10,000 invested. The reality is that 100% of cases that start early and begin decisively will end up rich. It\u2019s not a probability chart. It\u2019s not statistics. The market wins, every time. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s real, but rare. Here\u2019s why. Most people don\u2019t believe it works and if they think it might work, they either learn it too late in life or they are unable to do it, emotionally and they don\u2019t have the discipline and patience to do it. In The Millionaire Next Door and The Millionaire Mind, they drill into this question, who are the rich in America? It\u2019s not who you think. It\u2019s not the people in rich neighbourhoods with fancy cars, watches, boats and friends with rich specialist doctors and lawyers, etc. 80% of millionaires in America are first generation, self-made. That means the more $3mil to $15mil net worth group. I don\u2019t think they measured the ultra rich and billionaires and I think the stats are different for them. It also means wealth doesn\u2019t inherit or transfer well. Most of these \u2018regular rich\u2019 are business owners, of various businesses, accountants, vegetable farmers, car washes, sometimes laundromats but many, many types of businesses; there wasn\u2019t one common business they were all in as many think. They drive regular cars, such as Fords, wear regular clothes, have a regular Casio watch and like being with their families. Pretty boring stuff. They live in neighbourhoods with regular people such as mechanics and truck drivers, and so on. Doctors and lawyers are actually the worst investors around. They overspend to keep up appearances and keep up with their peers, taking expensive vacations and buying fancy toys and they do really badly in the markets. They\u2019re used to thinking they\u2019re smarter than most people so they figure they can invest better than most people too. They\u2019re wrong. They don\u2019t admit it at cocktail parties but the stats show, doctors and lawyers are the worst investors. They may brag about a score here and there on some stock they got lucky on, but overall, they lose, big time and subsidise their losses with what they earn from their high incomes. Another finding in these books and from Anne Schieber (a former IRS auditor worth over $20 million when she died): rich people often own stocks but they buy them after they get rich. They don\u2019t usually get rich from starting with stocks and succeeding. They usually buy stocks after they\u2019ve gotten rich from other things, often a mix of luck and happenstance, usually from sales commissions and having a few key friends that helped them get the right leads, customers and deals. So\u2026 knowing that\u2026 throw it all out. Start from zero. Your best bet is to avoid debt, ignore the brokers and other \u2018experts\u2019, have savings and buy the US index. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what works, but most people refuse to do it, get impatient and can\u2019t sit tight. They sabotage themselves by thinking they have to dance in and out, trying to time the market, outsmart others, etc. They feel the need to do something instead of doing nothing. Fidelity found something funny: their best account holders\u2026 are dead. That\u2019s right, people that died and couldn\u2019t meddle with their accounts, do best. The sitting, not the thinking. That\u2019s where the big gains are made. DALBAR studies show this over and over but nobody listens. The average investor gets maybe 2%-3% returns over time, but the index does about 8%-9% over time. If you just buy the index, you\u2019ll beat most investors. You\u2019ll double your money every 9\u201310 years or so, which really adds up. Many people also think that housing/real estate/property is the real way to get rich. It can be, but more often, it\u2019s just a lot of work and hassle. Housing doesn\u2019t return as much as the index over time. Rental properties can be good, depending on your tenants and location and how much you own on them, but being a landlord now since the virus is probably the worst thing to be. You can find yourself underwater in property fast and get crushed. That\u2019s the problem with any kind of leverage, it magnifies gains but also losses. Buffett said, if you\u2019re good, you won\u2019t need leverage and if you\u2019re not good, you should avoid leverage, so there you have it, don\u2019t borrow to invest, generally speaking. If you view it like a money garden, growing into a money farm, into a money ranch or estate, it will produce enough dividends for you to live off, quite well, but most people won\u2019t do that. 2% dividends on the S&P 500 today seems modest, but that will go back up to the historical average of about 4% in time. So you build your position while dividends are lower and reap the rewards later. E.g., 2% on $500,000 today is only $10,000/year so you reinvest your dividends. Double that $500k to $1 mil, then to $2 mil, so over time, 4% on $2 mil is $80,000/year. You can live quite well on that, especially with no debt. Plus, depending on how long you live, you may double that $2 mil to $4 mil or even $8 mil, so if dividend rates go down, you\u2019ll stay have really good income without ever touching the capital or principal. Even rich people that try to follow this, will often trade themselves poor, going backwards from wealth, to poverty and losing most or all of it. They get greedy and think they can trade their way to more gains. As well, they think buying exotic things such as diamonds, art, options, futures, and funding their friends\u2019 business startups will make them rich. It usually doesn\u2019t. It usually makes you poor. Your broker will make you \u2018broker\u2019, that\u2019s not just a joke, it\u2019s real. When you\u2019re rich, you get brokers trying to get your business. They don\u2019t want you holding a boring old index fund so they try to seduce you (that means mislead or lead astray) so they can make commissions off you. If they were truly rich, they\u2019d be living off their dividends and not selling advice. I\u2019m not an advisor, this isn\u2019t financial advice, but it is reality. I didn\u2019t become a broker or advisor because I couldn\u2019t feel right about making money on trailer fees and commissions, knowing this. I started investing when I was 20, in 1998, into 2.5% fee mutual funds, here in Ontario. Some did ok, some did really badly but eventually I went self directed, had some good luck, some bad too. If I had a time machine though, I\u2019d tell myself to just buy the S&P 500 index fund, steadily. It\u2019s so hard to be simple, but that\u2019s it. You come out ahead and put the odds in your favour. I was clever here and there, had some really nice returns in under a year time frame more than once but I would have done better just doing the index all that time. Probably too, because I\u2019d have viewed the index as one thing, a single entity despite being 500 stocks, and I\u2019d be more committed mentally to building it, whereas with various small positions on stocks I\u2019d trade, like a junior miner or a tiny tech company or an aggressive growth mutual fund, I\u2019d be viewing my money in blocks, compartmentalised. With a single index fund or at least, just a few, and viewed correctly, as a pool, that your money is all one thing, it can change your approach to money and your investing habits too. E.g. you think well I can lose $1000 on this stock because I did well from collecting rent and no repairs last month, etc. You lose on it maybe it gains first, then drifts down, and you\u2019re down 80% because you held. It happens a lot. You get over that need to learn from instructions, experts, follow hot tips, whatever, you growth through that, and just buy the index and keep adding to it. It can be the hardest thing to do, to just buy right and sit tight. To also buy when it\u2019s down, to try to buy more, but once you do it, it can grow into a great habit. I finally did buy just a US S&P 500 index fund, through my bank, starting over from literally zero (after travel, etc), in 2017, with $25/month. Pathetic right, after having stayed at exclusive spots for $700 US/night in Jamaica, or other great spots in England, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Israel\u2026 I saw everything I wanted to see, but on a budget. It mostly worked. Anyway, I started over and it was slow and it seemed pointless, but, now it\u2019s way past that critical mass and it\u2019s slowly and steadily growing. I\u2019m 42 but better late than never, and especially now knowing the exact whys and wherefores of it all, it makes much more sense. It really lets me see the virus market crash, and zooming back up 45% since, all in perspective. I felt no twinge of panic to buy or sell. It was great. I just pretend I\u2019m a dead investor, just observing and fascinated, but unable to change course, meaning, steadily building an index position.  \"Over the years, I've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I've learned a good deal about human behavior,\" Buffett said in the letter. \"My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund,\" he said. \"To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\" In the same letter, Buffett describes Jack Bogle, who transformed investing with the creation of the index fund, as a \"hero.\" Not everyone listens to Buffett's advice, however. \"I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions, or pension funds has followed that same advice when I've given it to them,\" he said. He said (emphasis added): \"Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant. \"That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment 'styles' or current economic trends make the shift appropriate. Warren Buffett thinks the 'elite' have wasted $100 billion ignoring his best investment advice  344 Best Money Farm images in 2020 | Country report, Investment quotes, Stock market quotes ",
