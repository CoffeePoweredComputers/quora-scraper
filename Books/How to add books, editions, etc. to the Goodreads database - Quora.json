Then, make sure you have an actual copy of the book ready, because you will be asked to provide as much detail as possible:  The form may look daunting at first, but only three fields are actually required. And most of the data will typically be located on the inside flap of the book, just copy it from there. The more information you add, the better. Especially the ISBN and/or ASIN will help make the book referenceable for other users. Once you're done click Create book to submit. There, done! You have done the reading community a great favor. ",
