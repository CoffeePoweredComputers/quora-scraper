Let\u2019s say you really want to improve your concepts in organic reaction mechanisms then I would suggest you go through Clayden. It gives you the depth comprehension of the above-mentioned section. Apart from that for general chemistry, you can follow any basic book which enhances your understanding. Because ultimately, understanding matters!! Hope, it helped you!! ",
