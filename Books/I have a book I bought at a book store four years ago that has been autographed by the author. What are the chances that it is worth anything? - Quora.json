            "answer_text": "My mother used to buy books because they were either signed, very old, or first editions. She never had time to read them; they were supposed to be an investment for the future. She was 85 years old when she was widowed, and found that she was no longer able to manage in her large home. Her book collection was in the thousands. Since she had to move to a smaller home, much of her time was taken up sorting books and deciding which she wanted to take to her new home. The family tried to help her, but without a great deal of success. This process was so difficult and emotionally draining for her that she never really completed it. On moving day, the new owners of her house agreed to take the stuff, including books, that she had failed to dispose of. She gave some books to me - a very old but ordinary Bible, falling apart, and a couple of other books I had always loved. She took about 2,000 of her books with her to her new home. There was not enough room for bookcases for all these, so most were piled on the floor in a spare bedroom. Eventually she got a bookseller to buy them. He paid mere pennies per book. Of the few she had left, she read perhaps two or three. Then at 92 she became disabled and needed full time care. She chose a few books to take into the care home with her. The rest were sold at auction, and didn\u2019t fetch much. Of the books she took to the care home, she started to read one. Then reading became more difficult for her, so it was never finished. TL:DR - If you want to buy books as an investment, you had better be an expert. Books are meant to be loved and read - then passed to someone else unless there is a good reason to keep them. Hoarding them for other purposes may result in a burdensome chore one day. ",
