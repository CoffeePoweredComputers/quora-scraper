            "answer_text": "I have purposefully reread books, I have also accidentally reread books. You pick up nuances that you didn't understand before. On one particular book, \"Catch Me When I Fall\", by Nicci French, I didn't really understand it on my first reading, and thought \"Meh, I think they lost their usual strength on that one\" (Nicci French is a husband and wife team that write together) However, when I read it accidentally the second time, I was really taken with the story, and had a much better understanding of the mental disease behind the character. Sometimes you just love the characters, you just want to hear them speak to you again. I cannot tell you how many times I have read \"Pride and Prejudice\" because it is like visiting  old friends, listening to them tell you their life stories one more time.  And I have been in situations where there are no other books to read, so I just reread one I have already gone through, good or not, just to have something to read. ",
