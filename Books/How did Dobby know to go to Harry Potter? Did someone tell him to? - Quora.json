Dobby makes it pretty clear to Harry that they don\u2019t notice him much as shown by this exchange: Harry: Won\u2019t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\u2019 Dobby: Dobby doubts it Sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something Sir. They just let Dobby get on with it Sir.\u2019 See Dobby is good as invisible to his employers Lucius probably discussed the plan with Narrissa or Draco without knowing or noticing Dobby was listening.
