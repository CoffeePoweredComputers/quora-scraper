            "answer_text": "Reading increases exposure to new words and makes it easier for words to stick. However, reading itself does not guarantee a high vocabulary. It's more important to be curious about words around you and to verify that you actually know their meanings. The more often a word is used, the longer it will endure. You need to keep track of new words you encounter while reading. It might seem like a lot of trouble, but it makes it easier to identify problem words. Writing them down forces you to move them into your active treasury of words. Most people aren\u2019t bothered to look up the definition of a specific word while reading; they don\u2019t want to interrupt their enjoyment. Instead, they might note the page number or circle that word and define its meaning later on using an English dictionary or thesaurus. Reading is arguably one of the best means of grasping new vocabulary. Go beyond the traditional novel and try magazines, journals, and so forth. Make an effort to read things from different time periods and different geographic regions. If you read any book older than fifty years, even if its language is not considered elevated or educated, it will probably contain certain words that seem unusual. Reading one piece of writing on an unfamiliar topic could be more effective than reading ten novels on a topic you are regularly exposed to. In my experience, most people with an advanced vocabulary and above-average language skills tend to listen more and talk less. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, people who read more tend to have a better vocabulary with a greater understanding of the usage of those words. ( *-* ) ",

            "answer_text": "Having become an inveterate reader since I was in elementary school I found that reading is best for those who enjoy it for its own sake. A side effect is of course the gaining of knowledge, different perspectives and most of all being excited by a new and unusual story. It is natural that the more your perspective expands, the greater your knowledge of words expands. When I was younger I read and enjoyed the masters such as Shakespeare, Melville and Dostoyevski. I read them for the sake of their story and word craft. I did not make a study of these authors, just had a good read and allowed context to help define questionable words. I am also reader of fantasy and sci-fi. If this is what you enjoy doing your vocabulary will grow in time. It also helps to keep a journal, say a page a day of any random or crazy thouts which may occur. After awhile get a dedicated eReader and as you may follow a beloved wordsmith such as I do I can with a finger touch have any word defined. This is sweet for I may know the meaning of a particular word or phrase, but admire the use, as to the shade of meanings. If it is poetry its sibilant sounds. I trust I haven\u2019t inundated you with my first paragraph, but as a suggestion, it would be good to keep a journal of words that strike your fancy or possibly a subject such as red; rubric, red letter day, sanguine and incarnate. The best way to expand your vocabulary is to feed your head as you would your body.and understanding is in all forms. Be it with reading and writing, drawing and painting, or even hacking and hewing. Life itself is a living, breathing vocabulary with which you define by your existence. So my answer is yes; but only if you stick to good reads. ENJOY ",
