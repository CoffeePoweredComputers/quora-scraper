            "answer_text": "We believe so. The Written Bible: 5 Books of Moses and the 24 following Books of Prophets and Writings are complete. The \u201cMishna\u201d is the oldest authoritative post-biblical collection and codification of Jewish oral laws, systematically compiled by numerous scholars (called tannaim) over a period of about two centuries. The codification was given final form early in the 3rd century ad by Judah ha-Nasi. The Mishna supplements the written, or scriptural, laws found in the Pentateuch. It presents various interpretations of selective legal traditions that had been preserved orally since at least the time of Ezra (c. 450 bc). Intensive study of the Mishna by subsequent scholars (called amoraim) in Palestine and Babylonia resulted in two collections of interpretations and annotations of it called the Gemara, or Talmud. In the broader sense of the latter terms, the Mishna and Gemara together make up the Talmud (q.v.). It\u2019s apparent to Jewish scholars that big chunks of the Talmud is lost, likely because of constant campaigns by the Christian church and its lackeys to eradicate Judaism. So, volumes of explanations and fine-tuning of particular components of rituals are gone. THERE ARE NO MISSING COMMANDMENTS OR OBLIGATIONS. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless you mean to be asking a different question, your question answers itself - if a book is lost it can not be in the current Bible. The canonical books if the New Testament were all written by the mid 2nd Century. There are known books not included in the canon. Edit: I do think you mean to ask a different question, but I am not sure what that question is. Are parts of some books lost? Are there books that were known and later lost, e.g. epistle referenced in some work but non extant? Are there books that were not added/removed from \u201cthe\u201d canon intentionally? Maybe you are asking why some texts were not added or why canons differ. ",

Certainly interesting. Now someone on here more edumacated than I may be able to tell us things that are truly lost yet referenced in history. For example the third tablet that Moses carried down from the mountain, then dropped and broke. Commandments 11\u201315 I believe. Now God messed up on that one, Moses was an old man on a good day, how was he supposed to carry three of those buggers down a mountain? Anyway, as I said, someone more knowledgeable than I may be able to direct you. ",
