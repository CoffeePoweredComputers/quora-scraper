But if you are absolutely positive and have your mind set on writing this book, I would suggest doing it in a way where the main character represents you, instead of telling it with I, Me, etc. A good way of being your thoughts together is to collectively write them out on a price of paper, or maybe sticky notes, and moving them to fit chronological order. I am not quite experienced in writing books like this, but I hope this helps you sort out you thoughts. Best of luck! ",
