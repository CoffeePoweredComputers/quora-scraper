            "answer_text": "There is no set time - it varies from one child to another. And what exactly do you mean by being able to read? I was reading fluently by the end of my first year at school, but there were others in the class who could only read very haltingly, picking out one word at a time. Which do you call reading? My husband, brother and one of my sons all took more than a year to learn; they were all more interested in other things, and reading was very secondary to them. My daughter, though, was desperate to learn to read, so I taught her her letters and their sounds when she was a little over three; it took only a few weeks for her to know them all. There was then a bit of a gap, because I didn't know what to do next. When we started again, from a standing start to her being able to read proper children's books confidently by herself ( Harry the Dirty Dog and The Tiger Who Came to Tea were the first two) took about 3 months. By the time she started school, at 4.5 years, she had a reading age of 8.5 years. So with a bright child who wants to read, taught in a 1:1 basis, you could say less than 6 months to fluent, confident reading. But not all children are as keen to learn to read, and most aren't taught on a 1:1 basis. It's impossible to give a definite figure. Children are individual people, not objects produced in a factory process. Don't try to generalise. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not an easy to answer question. Even with young children of average intelligence in elementary school the length of time it takes to teach them to read fluently can vary by two years or more. The cause of the illiteracy will affect the time. For example many illiterate adults were taught to read in the past but failed to catch on due to learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Others were not exposed to a large vocabulary, so even when they memorize the phonemes and string them together they cannot understand the words. I would suggest that it would probably take at least 6 to 12 months of continued practice, with the best teacher to go from complete illiteracy to reading at a fourth grade level. The brain simply will not take on too much information, no matter how much you study. Therefore, studying all day would not help. ",
