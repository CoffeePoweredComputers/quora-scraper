            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t own this book, so I cannot speak to its quality or ability to help you in your goal. I can\u2019t image how it could hurt you; I suppose it can only help you do well (not good) in your class. Of course, if the rest of the class purchases version x and you purchase version y, you will have a hard time contributing to class discussions due to the different pagination. I can\u2019t help but feel, though (based on your question details), that you should change your goal. Your goal seems to be the short-term goal of getting a good grade in your tenth-grade English class. Your teacher\u2019s goal seems to be for you to learn critical-thinking skills that you can have them at your disposal in the long term. I just deleted the rest of the scolding response that I typed up. It was probably wrong. I simply don\u2019t believe in supplements. If the teacher wanted you to have a supplement, he or she would have assigned it. Ask your teacher. Yes, you should ask this question of your teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "Student annotations in an English class are meant to include important information about the book (definitions, background,etc.) as well as student insights. Hearn\u2019s book will give you a great deal of material to draw from including the idiomatic expressions that Huck uses, insights into the various revisions of the book, the original illustrations as well as the controversy surrounding them, reader\u2019s reactions and so on. Hearn\u2019s book focuses on the process of the writing and publishing the book which may not really meet your needs. IF you are really not sure how to approach annotating your text, talk to your teacher. Ask for a list of things to look for: irony, metaphors, idiomatic expressions, etc. Here\u2019s the real trick to doing well in English which expects you to annotate and do double entry journals: read the novel. Pay attention in class. THINK about what you are discovering as you read the book. Apply what you are reading to what you are experiencing in the world today. And let me give you a word to look up: hegemony. It applies to what is happening today in the world, especially in the US, and it applies to Huck Finn. Good luck. ",
