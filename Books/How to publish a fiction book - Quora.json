            "answer_text": "Your best bet at getting a big publishing company is to acquire a literary agent. One who believes in the quality and value of what you have written.  Big publishing companies will not accept an unsolicited manuscript without representation by a legitimate literary agent. So if you are going to reach out for anyone's approval, a literary agent is a good place to start. Do not rely on the opinion of any single agent. Try several before you choose to give up on them.   There are companies that make a business of publishing unknown authors. However, they do very little to help you sell and require a lot of money in what may eventually appear to you to be a publishing scam. They do guarantee a certain number of books, but more or less leave the selling part up to you. Unless you decide to pay a lot more money for very little guarantee.   You can self-publish an E-book and even do so on several publishing sites on the internet. Certain internet formats may be required.   Amazon accepts E-books for a commission of sales made. But be aware that there are thousands of E-books published every year.   The best way to protect your work is a literary copyright from the Library of Congress. Which is expensive and does take some time.   However, a personal copyright can be achieved by  placing single copies of your manuscript into three separate envelopes. Seal them, place required postage and mail them back to yourself. Keep each in separate and secure locations if possible. Never open them. Once some form of copyright infringement is suspected, then a judge in any lawsuit will open the unopened and postdated envelope. That Post Office date on the envelope is considered a legal form of copyright. Do not reveal anything you have written to anyone ( even an agent) without at least this personal copyright in your possession.Good luck on your quest. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is somewhat convoluted and that's why you're getting some strange answers. The simple answer to your rendered-down question (\"How do I publish a book?\") is: (a) you either indie publish and have your book up and available to eRetailers, bookstores, libraries, and academic institutions in a few days; or (b) you spend years trying to get your book published by a publisher.  It doesn't matter whether your book is fiction or non-fiction, the process and results are the same (with the only slightl difference being the publishers you target if you want to go the legacy publishing route). Whether you go with a small, medium, or large publisher, it is still going to take years to get your work out.  The length of time will vary by publisher (not by the size of the publisher, but by their process). There really isn't any such thing as a \"top one\" when it comes to publishers; there are some that are better than others, some that have more books sold than others, and some that just plain suck.  Do your research.  In the end, though, you're going to need an agent to get your work past the gatekeepers if you're bound and determined to go this route. Law-wise ... I have no idea what you're asking.  There's no \"law-wise\" in publishing, unless you're talking copyright, plagiarism, or contracts.  Whatever you do, make sure you copyright your work.  If you do decide to contract with a publisher, make sure YOUR attorney reads and signs off on the contract. Finally, the important difference between indie publishing and legacy publishing is this: royalties and availability.  Indie authors make about 70% royalties.  Locked-down authors who went with a dinosaur publisher usually make around 14.5% in royalties.  Indie author's works are available forever.  Locked-down author's works are available for a few months four or five years from now, then they're shipped back to the publisher where they become silverfish farms in a warehouse somewhere. Some will say that by using a dinosaur publisher you're going to get the benefit of editing, artwork, distribution, and marketing.   It's all a lie; you'll get the cheapest editor (you're nobody; they're not going to spend the money getting a GOOD editor on your work) and the least expensive artwork (you'll have no approval over the artwork, either).  YOU can hire a great editor and contract excellent artwork yourself.  Go indie. Distribution?  You - by yourself - have exactly the same distribution channels as any New York publisher.  Go indie. Marketing?  You're nobody.  You'll get none.  Your book will be thrown in a box as part of a package deal where a guaranteed best seller is used as leverage to get a bunch of nothing books into bookstores.  Your book will end up spine-out (in, undoubtedly, the wrong section) for a few months languishing unsold until such time as the bookstore can return it for credit. So, to sum up: go indie. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask; I help get authors published every day! To correct some misconceptions: There is no \u201cbest bet\u201d when it comes to publishing.The size of the publishing company - if you go with legacy publishing - is largely irrelevant.  Whether they\u2019re publishing your book is the important bit.A literary agent doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cquality and value\u201d they believe in one thing: sales.There are no companies that \u201cmake a business of publishing unknown authors\u201d and who \u201crequire a lot of money.\u201d  That\u2019s vanity publishing.  It\u2019s a scam.  Don\u2019t do it.Amazon DOES NOT \u201caccept E-books [sic] for a commission of the sales made.\u201d  Amazon is a retailer.There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cpersonal copyright.\u201d  There\u2019s only a literary copyright, which you get by filling out form TX - available from the U.S. Copyright Office here: Page on copyright.govThe nonsensical \u201cmail a copy to yourself\u201d is complete and utter BS.  It\u2019s called \u201cPoor Man\u2019s Copyright and it provides no protection of any kind.  It is not any form of copyright.  I wrote all about how stupid this advice is here: Myth of the Poor Man's Copyright - Shawn E. BellThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cformal publisher.\u201dYou don\u2019t send \u201cqueries to companies\u201d at all; you hire an agent.  The agent is the person who gets your work into publishers.No legitimate publisher will \u201crequire you to pay for an editor\u201d nor will hey \u201cinclude it in the royalty payments they take from you.\u201d Why? Because no legitimate publisher will ever TAKE your royalties.  Duh.If you don\u2019t know the answer, please don\u2019t post guesses on Quora. ",
