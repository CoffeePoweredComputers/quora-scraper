            "answer_text": "The answer, as always, is \u201cit depends.\u201d Let\u2019s trace things\u2026 The volume was first written, creating a copyright in that work. Depending on the circumstances under which it was written the copyright might be with the author at this point, or with the entity for which the work was done (often the publisher in the case of a \u201cwork for hire\u201d). If the author controlled the copyright then for publication to happen, some rights would have to be assigned to the publisher. In the case of books it\u2019s common for authors to sell some portion of the rights; e.g. \u201cfirst North American print publication\u201d rights can be sold separately from \u201cfirst worldwide digital publication\u201d rights. Rights sold under contract can be for terms, can have renewal options, and so on. If the entity that controlled the rights (say, the publisher) goes out of business, those rights are part of the assets of the company. At dissolution, a company\u2019s assets are usually assigned to pay off creditors and so on. It\u2019s possible these rights were assigned in that way to some other entity. It\u2019s also possible that the contract had reversion clauses in it. Often these clauses stipulate that if a work goes out of print rights revert back to the author, or in the case of dissolution of the owning entity rights might also revert. It\u2019s all based on contract language none of us know. In many cases, contracts aren\u2019t drawn properly to handle all these circumstances and a work becomes an \u201corphan\u201d - that is, something for which copyright exists but the owner of that copyright either no longer exists or cannot be found. Unfortunately, although there has been some legal progress in the treatment of orphan works, there\u2019s still no good universally established framework for handling them. ",
