            "answer_text": "Ask friends and relatives. There are a few things that bother me from your details. Please remember that I\u2019ve been a CPA for over 3 decades and has had my own firm since 9/1/91. \u201cI mean one who takes initiative and suggests strategies I could use to claim more write-offs.\u201d Guess what? Often times - especially with newer businesses - this is simply NOT the best tax strategy. Sure for a single year approach it is BBUUTT have you considered the long term? As businesses mature the income level for the owners generally goes up. With that the taxes. Thus a deduction in year 3 or later will yield a greater tax effect than one in year 1 (think 179 depreciation). I\u2019d strongly suggest that you look for someone that takes a multiyear approach into consideration that just the current year. For example I have in the past actually recommended that a client pay substantially more taxes over a 5 year period in order to save taxes in years 6 forward. I\u2019ve one going currently that is paying about $150k a year more for a 5 year period than they could legally be paying. (think $750k MORE. Why? Well when they sell the business in year 6 - 10 (as they are projecting) the structure that I have them in now will save them about $5 million when they sell. Nice payoff in the long run. Seems like every CPA just wants to make minimal effort. As a long term CPA many clients are concerned about the current short term bills. Penny wise and pound foolish. Think about your interactions with your CPA? Have you unwittingly conveyed to them this \u201ccheapness\u201d on your part by complaining about bills? NOT wanting to do any mid year or end of the year tax planning? For example, I asked my CPA a question and she referred me to the IRS website. See the above - I know of NO CPA who does not want to make more money. What attitude have you conveyed to your CPA? Yes, I could learn the tax code myself but then what do I pay her for? Generally, it seems like I and most CPAs that I know of function in the manner that you are looking for. Most of the ones here on Quora (based on their responses over the years) Wray Rives, Mike Emeigh, myself, etc seem to function in the manner you are looking for. I think the issue have is probably \u201cself-imposed\u201d by your prior communications with your current CPA. ",
