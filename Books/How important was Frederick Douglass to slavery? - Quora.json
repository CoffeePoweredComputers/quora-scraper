            "answer_text": "How important was Frederick Douglass to slavery? Important to slavery? Not very much. Important to the Abolishement of chattel slavery? Very. Through his autobiographies, essays and public speeches, he was able to capture the minds and often the hearts of many of the White people who followed his work. Before Blacks were finally able to really voice their stories about their lives as slaves, Whites often only had access to pseudo-scientific documents or racist literature that, in one way or the other, stated that Blacks were generally happy as slavesWere too simple minded for any other workWere genetically built for back breaking laborWere cursed by God himself to a life of laborDidn\u2019t feel pain in the same way as WhitesWeren\u2019t really humanIt wasn\u2019t until they began to hear and read from former slaves, who were intelligent and could eloquently explain what life was like as a slave in this country, that people began to slowly understand that what they were doing was wrong. And that they were doing it to other human beings with family, hopes, dreams and feelings that were just like theirs. One of the minds that he (and others like him) was able to touch was Harriett Beecher Stowe. This proved to be the nail in the coffin for Slavery as the White woman set down to write a ficionalized book about slavery that simply regurgitated the real stories she previously read. But now it came from a White person\u2026. so it must be true.

            "answer_text": "Robert, Frederick Douglass wasn\u2019t at all important to slavery. What Douglass represented was slavery\u2019s terrible weakness. The fact is that we were NOT all created equal. Some of us are gifted in music, mechanically, as athletes, or with the ability to think. We all have different abilities and gifts, which means we were all created unique and different. The reason bonded labor systems (e.g., slavery and serfdom) have been the rule since humans abandoned the hunter/gatherer lifestyle is for social stability. For slaves and serfs, at least in theory, all they had to do was what they were told and their needs were met, with their thinking done for them. There was no worry about the least capable making rash, bad decisions. Most people are poor as a result of an inability or unwillingness to make good decisions. This is why reactive movements\u2014such as communism, socialism, fascism, and now ethnonationalism\u2014have followed liberalism for its entire existence. A competitive system in which the sky is the limit is as bad for the least talented people as it is good for the most talented. Socialism and communism are merely the latest manifestations of systems designed to do the thinking for ordinary people. Along with other black critics of slavery, Douglass was obviously very bright, and thus found it intolerable to be required to let others do his thinking for him. What is needed is a system that is good for both the least and most talented. And that\u2019s not what we have now. ",
