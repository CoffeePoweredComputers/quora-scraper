            "answer_text": "well for starters all the oracles will be freed one way or the other\u2026.. then there will be the big fight between apollo and python and it cud be all 3 emperors vs Apollo or the greed for power of the emperors will make them destroy each other (those conversations b/w python and nero) and I\u2019m really hoping Jason is revived . Deaths mourned ,victory celebrated Apollo tries to honour them all ofcourse he will get his immortality back maybe even standup to Zeus\u2026..(That\u2019s a long shot :P) the campers now respect Apollo more\u2026\u2026\u2026..since he always remembers his struggles (that promise by Jason ) Annnnndddd I really wanna see how Stynx punishes him \u2026.(yes i remember the \u201cppl u care about will die\u201d thing..bt i wanna see how it all rounds up at the end. And Rachel is back in business!!!!! ",

But aside from my hopes, Apollo will gain his immortality back and his trial with Meg will end. I think Apollo will find love and become selfless, or at least better about that stuff. And, hey, maybe Piper, Jason, Hazel, and Frank will finally get to punch Leo!  ",
