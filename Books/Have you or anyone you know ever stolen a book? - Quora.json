            "answer_text": "Hahahaha. I have. But i didn\u2019t steal the book directly, like taking the book without the owner\u2019s knowledge. It tends to be more creative stealing, lol :D. So, I had a friend who loved books about history and I\u2019ve never met him since I went to high school, I borrowed his books and when I went to high school and I never returned the books. I was 15 and what a bookworm students wanted is to have their bookshelves stuffed with books. I don\u2019t suggest you to steal books though. Actually, i want to return the books if i meet him, hopefully he\u2019ll understand that was just a mistake or not. Lol :D ",

            "answer_text": "I know of many people who have been arrested for stealing books from the college bookstore. Most of them were stealing to support their drug habit. Some, however, could not afford to pay for the damn books for their college classes. I find this very sad. People are trying to better themselves by getting an education, but the damn cost of tuition and books is ridiculous. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are options to help with financing but seems like you gotta jump through hoops to get this done. Perhaps this is part of the educational experience. That\u2019s all I have to say about that. ",

            "answer_text": "Stolen? Never! As an author now, but even before I was one officially, I always wanted to make sure the author received payment for their hard work in writing it. Most writers barely make ends meet in exchange for the readers hours of pleasure - they do it for love, but we should value what they offer us more highly than we do. Even some publishers don\u2019t respect the work of their authors, taking a large amount of the revenues with little in exchange. Yet without those dedicated and passionate authors they wouldn\u2019t have a business.I have even less respect for those who pirate. ",

            "answer_text": "While now I am ashamed of it, I did steal from my school library. But I have my reasons! And no it still doesn\u2019t justify my actions. Reason 1- Every year, they\u2019d replenish the books and pile outside the old dilapidated books to be given away. I\u2019d have my pick from them without the librarian\u2019s knowledge. Okay, given that they were to be given away, it\u2019s not exactly stealing. Reason 2- certain books were only \u201callowed\u201d from a certain Grade and above. Sidney Sheldon books were among those. And my sister, who was finishing her high school, had given me a book of his and boy, did I love his books. So, in 6th grade I snuck 3 Sidney Sheldon books, on 3 separate occasions, hid it among my textbooks and took it home. I\u2019ve still got it in my bookshelf. P.S. : Please don\u2019t repeat my actions. I was 12 or so years old and quite senseless. Take a membership in a public library, read all you want. ",
