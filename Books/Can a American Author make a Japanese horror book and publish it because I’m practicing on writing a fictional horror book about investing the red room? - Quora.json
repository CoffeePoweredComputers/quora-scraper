            "answer_text": "OK, if I understand the question, you\u2019re looking at using a specifically Japanese myth or legend, or historical setting, for your story. As long as you research things well and delete anything that could be a Western attitude about what\u2019s happening, you could probably do quite well. If you\u2019ve actually lived in Japan, or have close ties to a Japanese-American community, you should be able to capture the flavor. One thought, if your narrator is not Japanese, demonstration of knowledge, firmly grounded in the culture, is a plus. If you could get someone who is Japanese to beta the story, even better. Best of luck to you. ",
