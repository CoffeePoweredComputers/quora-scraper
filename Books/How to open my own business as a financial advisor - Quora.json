            "answer_text": "You will need to get licensed in order to give investment advice. If you want to sell securities you will need a number of licenses. In order to obtain these licenses you will need to spend a lot of time studying before you take the securities and insurance license exams. There are insurance and securities exam preparation products you can purchase to give you the knowledge you will need to have in order to pass the exams. In order to sit for an exam you will have to pay a fee to take the exam at a testing center. You should expect to pay somewhere in the ballpark of $150 to $200 for each exam preparation course and about the same amount of money to to take each exam. In other words, it will cost you somewhere around $300 to $400 to buy one study course and take each exam. You will likely need to obtain at least three, but probably four licenses before you are fully licensed. Also, in order to take most of these exams you will need to be sponsored by a company who is willing to hire you once you have passed the exams. One way around that is to take the Series 25 securities exam. It is my understanding that no sponsor is needed in order to take this exam. But, once you pass that exam you will only be allowed to offer advice on investments and you will not be allowed to sell any investments without first obtaining the Series 6 or Series 7 license along with the insurance license. Obtaining the Series 65 license can give you a foot in the door. But, it is also an additional license, so you will likely need to obtain five licenses in order to be fully licensed as a financial advisor. This is the license I would obtain first, but I was previously in the business. I don\u2019t really want to sell any securities, I would just want to offer investment advice. The only thing stopping me from doing this is my age. I am 69 years old. The licenses I believe you will need are the Series 7 license, which is very tough exam, the Series 63, which is the state exam, the life insurance license and I believe that there is another license you have to obtain before you are even allowed to take the Series 7 exam. It is called the SIE exam. To obtain all of the needed licenses, if that is what I was going to to, would take me anywhere from six to ten months, maybe a year. It would cost me around $1,000 total, give or take a couple of dollars. Please don\u2019t take everything that I said as Gospel, but I believe everything that I said about the licensing requirements is correct. You should check everything out yourself, just in case I am wrong. Good luck. ",
