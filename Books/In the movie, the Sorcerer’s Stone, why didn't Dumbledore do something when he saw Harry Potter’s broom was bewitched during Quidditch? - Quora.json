            "answer_text": "You mean the scene where Hermione burned Snape's robe? Well easy. The answer is Dumbledore knows that Snape is protecting Harry. There is no point in Dumbledore participating as Snape is a fully capable powerful wizard as well. If Dumbledore to stand up and check it on person, it will attract everybody's attention, and may or may not create panic/chaos, the perpetrator will stop their business and blend right in into the crowd. If a great man needs to come and save the day everytime he sees something wrong then he'll spend his day rescuing people non stop. ",

He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d Above is a part of conversation between Harry and Quirrell in the book \u2018Harry Potter and the Socerer\u2019s Stone\u2019. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. I think this answers your question about book. I believe he was not present when Quirrell was cursing Harry\u2019s Broomstick in the movies also. And if he was present well movie got it wrong like so many other things. ",
