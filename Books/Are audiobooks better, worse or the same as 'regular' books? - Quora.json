            "answer_text": "I don't think there are studies that definitively show that, if that's what you mean. But different people absorb information differently. Personally, I've found that I absolutely absorb more from audiobooks. This isn't surprising, as in college, I felt that I got a lot more from lectures than I did from reading, which seemed to be the opposite of most people's tendencies. It probably depends on the material, too. If you're reading about something that can be helped by visual media like charts or images (e.g., economics or art history), obviously a book is going to be better because you don't get that with audio. Also, audio has distinct disadvantages in terms of being able to \"re-read\" parts or highlight passages. While it's possible to do, it's much more cumbersome. ",
