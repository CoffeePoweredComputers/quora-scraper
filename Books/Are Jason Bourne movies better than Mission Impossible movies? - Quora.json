            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s acknowledge two important things: The Bourne films and the Mission: Impossible films are trying to do two different things. The former is a gritty series about black ops gone wrong and exactly how far the ends justify the means; the latter have a (rather repetitive) nod to a similar theme but are - especially in the later episodes - about recreating the fun of the tv series: a team pulling off seemingly impossible missions through staggeringly elaborate plans.The Bourne films took a tired genre - the spy thriller - and reinvigorated it in such a way that every film in the genre made after The Bourne Supremacy has been influenced by it to some degree. They\u2019ve become more plausible (at least in physical terms), more world-weary, less black and white, and more driven by visceral action sequences with the camera right in the think of it.That acknowledged, we also need to look at the quality of the series themselves. I loved The Bourne Identity, from the first minute to the end titles (and Moby\u2019s Bourne theme of Extreme Ways). But most people feel that Paul Greengrass\u2019s first two entries in the series took it up to a higher level. Supremacy and Ultimatum are cracking movies (and probably warrant a Godfather-style edit in which Ultimatum is cut into its rightful setting of taking place mostly between the last two scenes of Supremacy). After that, it\u2019s been a bit downhill. The Bourne Legacy had an interesting concept (what happened to the Treadstone/Blackbriar agents who were shut down after the events of Identity?) and a strong cast (Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz), but somehow never quite caught fire in the same way as its predecessors. Jason Bourne was better, with a returning Greengrass and Matt Damon, but indulged a bit too much in the series\u2019 bad habits (yet another CIA conspiracy, yet another woman Bourne is close to killed), and its efforts to stay relevant also felt very forced. Mission: Impossible on the other hand, has a very different trajectory. The original film was a cargo-cult version of the tv series: on the surface it had all the bits you remembered, but they were done by people who didn\u2019t really understand how the series worked. For me it was summed up by U2\u2019s hamfisted fllleting of Lalo Schiffrin\u2019s theme music. One of the great TV theme tunes [1] was transposed from 5/4 time to 4/4 to make it easier to dance to, and in the process all the life and edginess was drained out of it. M:I2 was a bit better, but ultimately couldn\u2019t deliver on its strong cast and premise with a coherent ending. It\u2019s marked out by a motorbike chase in which the tyres on Tom Cruise\u2019s bike visibly change from shot to shot, and for giving us Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine because Dougray Scott\u2019s shooting schedule on it overran. MI:3 improved things further still. JJ Abrams got how the plot was supposed to work, and made a very important casting decision by bringing in Simon Pegg in a smallish comic relief role. The fourth instalment, Ghost Protocol, brought in two important changes for the good. Firstly, it was helmed by Brad Bird, who went back to the TV series and produced a film much closer in tone and style to the original - even down to not messing with the Schiffrin - while also including some genuinely smart additions of its own. Secondly, and I think this is down to Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg had a much expanded role. Although Jeremy Renner was supposed to be stepping up to eventually take on Cruise\u2019s role, it became clear at this point that Pegg\u2019s chemistry with the rest of the team was genuinely engaging. Scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie took over for Rogue Nation and Fallout, the latest two films, and successfully ran with what worked, while - at his own insistence - giving each film a very distinctive style. Fallout in particular has some stunning action sequences and one of the best climaxes to an action movie I\u2019ve seen - with a lot of the stunt work done for real rather than through CGI in post. Mission: Impossible is one of the few movie series that has managed a consistent upward trend from episode to episode. Bourne hit a high plateau early on and has since meandered downwards. While remembering that they are trying to do very different things, my personal ranking from worst to best would be: Mission: ImpossibleLegacyMI:2MI:3Jason BourneGhost ProtocolRogue NationSupremacy / Ultimatum (best viewed as a single story in two parts)IdentityFallout.

            "answer_text": "Out of the Jason Bourne films, I\u2019ve only seen The Bourne Identity, which was a long time ago and bits and pieces of the later installments. I also saw The Bourne Legacy if that even counts. I can definitely tell you that in terms of entertainment quality, filmmaking, and charisma, the Mission: Impossible films, especially the later installments beginning with Ghost Protocol, take the cake. The Bourne films seem to take themselves too seriously and are steeped within political intrigue, which is fine. But again, too serious. Added to that are the haphazard and poorly filmed fight scenes. Shaky cam and sharp cuts that do not showcase the choreography between the actors and stuntmen fighting onscreen, but are likely mainly used to hide the poor choreography and lack of energy that you\u2019d find in the fight scenes of the Mission: Impossible films. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is one of the latest movies to have one of the most creative fight scenes in cinematic history. Added, if you\u2019re a fan of Jackie Chan and grew up with his movies, you would like the action set pieces in the new M:I films. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on each of the films in the franchise. Personally I thought The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum and Jason Bourne were better than Mission: Impossible 2 and 3. The first Mission: Impossible was better than The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Legacy. I think I prefer Mission: Impossible 4\u20136 over all of the Jason Bourne films. ",
