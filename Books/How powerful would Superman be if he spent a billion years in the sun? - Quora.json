            "answer_text": "Depends on the version of Superman we're talking about. Pre-Flashpoint Superman in the Our Worlds At War arc, he dived into the Sun. And when he emerged from it, he was very changed. He gained such a power boost Brainiac 13 was unable to stop him and even a direct attack of Imperiex didn't harmed him in any way. He was able to pull Warworld through a Boom Tube to the beginning of the Universe. To the very moment of the Big Bang and he survived it! True that when he returned he was back to normal. But one can wonder what would've happened if instead of being inside the Sun just for a few minutes, instead he had stayed there for days, weeks or months.  Our Worlds At War sun dipped Superman All-Star Superman spent just a few minutes close to the Sun surface, he didn't even dived into the Sun. And from that experience alone his power level was tripled and he also gained new powers. BUT! With All-Star Superman that exposure proved to cause what seemed to be death but was in fact a metamorphosis of Superman body where it started to become made of pure energy and consciousness.  All-Star Superman New 52 Superman flew to the heart of the Sun and said he came out of the experience stronger. But he wasn't changed in any way.  New 52 Superman The best and only example we got so far comes in the form of Superman-Prime One Million.  Superman-Prime One Million He spent only 15.000 years inside the Sun, and his power was completely unmatched. It was said in the comics that Superman could grant his descendants any power any metahuman ever had and beyond that. Take for example the effective leader of the Supermen Squad, Kal Kent. These were his powers: Stronger than a collapsed star (Black Hole)Faster than a TachyonAble to jump from one planet to anotherAll of normal kryptonian powers10 extra senses that gave him powers like:TelepathyTelekinesis5th dimensional powersQuantum energy powersForce blastsCapable of running several billions scenarios in his mind at the same timeHe had no weakness to red solar energy, psychics and magic, seeing he basically had psychic powers and his extra senses also granted him powers that seemed like magicHe could use what he called Force BlastsNow. Even Kal Kent admitted that compared to Superman-Prime his powers were nothing. The greatest example came from the Super-Sun. After Superman-Prime returned to the solar system after spending 70.000 years traveling throughout the cosmos and beyond it, he made the Sun his Fortress. The Sun became an extension of Superman-Prime himself. And Kal Kent drew his power from the Super-Sun. When he's trapped in the 20th century. Even with Earth's sun his powers began to fade away. He specifically says that without the Super-Sun to fuel his powers he would lose most of the powers he had and also his power level would severally diminish. Meaning that most of Kal Kent powers had been given to him by Superman-Prime. If not then his connection/dependency of the Super-Sun made no sense. Seeing he was already the leader of the Supermen family before Superman-Prime returned. As it was when Superman-Prime returned from the Sun he was all gold. His skin, his hair, everything in him was like gold. There was even a comic where we see a character escaping his dying universe and arriving on Superman-Prime timeline/universe. And Superman-Prime says that if he had been made aware of what was happening on that character universe then he would've saved it from destruction. So that basically confirms Superman was powerful enough he could save a universe that was dying. And if he can save a dying universe then he had to have the power to destroy universes or create them. All of this with him only having spent 15.000 years inside the Sun. Although I'm not entirely sure the Sun actually did anything to enhance his powers. After all if he had traveled throughout the cosmos and beyond it then by that time his powers were beyond anything the yellow sun could offer him. Another important detail is that when Superman-Prime made the Sun into his Fortress, the sun became the Super-Sun. Thus the Sun was changed by the presence of Superman-Prime in it and not the other way around. Also given what has been said throughout the years, the main version of Superman apparently only needs stars until he reaches a certain level of power. Once that is reached then he no longer needs stars at all. But he still grows more powerful over time. So in my opinion Superman diving into the Sun would only accelerate the process to the point Superman no longer needed any star. After that he would grow more powerful as time went on. So in one billion years, we can only assume Superman would've obtained a near infinite power and near infinite abilities. ",

            "answer_text": "You see this man right here?  This is Superman Prime, he is literally an omnipotent being after spending a measly 15,000 years in the sun's core just gathering solar energy. He is unstoppable a God among Gods, quite literally nothing could even look in his direction without being instantly vaporized. This version of Superman can create universe at his own will  He was also so distraught by the fact Lois died that he not only restored her life force, he essentially turned her into a semi-omnipotent being who is 1,000 times stronger than standard Superman which in its own right is hard to even fathom  After all this, and your question is.. if Superman spent a billion years in the Sun!? Well, he would probably become literally the embodiment of everything, anything that can or will ever may or may not happen. He would literally be an infinity sign, any reality, timeline, dimension, probability, idea, or none of it at the same time. Now we get into the realm of strangeness. That would be Superman Prime Onebillion. ",
