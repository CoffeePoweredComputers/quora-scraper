            "answer_text": "I think the fundamental difference, if you profile the average stereotyped Japanese person against the average stereotyped American, is that the Japanese are a lot more introspective, contemplative folk. This leads to more nuance- and that's where the exceptional horror lies.  Hollywood horror tends to be a lot about shock and gore- Japanese horror, like their culture, is a lot more subtle and veiled. Hollywood movies try to scary you. Japanese movies get you to scare yourself. So to answer the question directly- they make exceptional horror movies by really digging deep into the human psyche. They don't just go for the scare. They make you feel nervous, edgy, uncomfortable, unsettled- and then they scale it up. Thai horror is pretty damn good, too, and I think for the same reasons. The people are more nuanced in their social lives, so it somehow makes sense that the horror will be a lot more nuanced, too. \"ROAR SCARY GUY WITH A CHAINSAW WHO SAWS FACES\" vs that quiet, shy girl your friends raped and murdered has been sitting on your shoulders ever since she died... watching everything you do, sharing your presence, keeping you company... forever... (Disclaimer: I'm not Japanese. I'm a Singaporean Indian who spends a disproportionately large amount of time watching anime and reading up on Japanese culture and stuff, but I am no by no means any sort of authority.) ",

I would just like to add that the Japanese have an extraordinary \u2018library\u2019 of monsters, ghosts and spirits to draw upon. Their culture is replete with horrors. Which other country or culture has a \u2018spirit which licks filth off of untidy bathrooms?\u2019 The Japanese do. Or a rubber-necked demon like her?  Here is the massive list of monsters the Japanese have to draw upon from Wikipedia- I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if lots were missing\u2026 List of legendary creatures from Japan - Wikipedia ",
