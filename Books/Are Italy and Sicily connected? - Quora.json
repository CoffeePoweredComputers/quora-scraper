            "answer_text": "Connected, how? Sicily is an island, there is no land connection between Sicily and \u201cthe continent\u201d (mainland Italy is called so in Sicily). It is connected as Dover and Calais, by ferry, just much nearer (less than 2 miles).  Why there isn\u2019t a bridge, or a tunnel? The deeper reason is that the two sides are in different continents. Sicily is in the African plate, mainland Italy is in Eurasian plate. The straits are moving. There are powerful volcanos just nearby: South side, Etna.  This is Vulcano island, just north (mildly active)  This is Stromboli, further North (picture taken few days ago, but eruptions are several times every day)  Mount Stromboli has been in almost continuous eruption for the past 2,000 years. The straits are a very busy waterway, the main way from Tirrenian and Aegean sea. Very deep (more than 1000 m.), with very strong currents (never heard of Between Scylla and Charybdis? Scylla is a location in the mainland, Charybdis in Sicily). Building a bridge has been attempted, but failed, too technically challenging. A tunnel, impossible (a submerged floating tunnel has been considered too). ",
