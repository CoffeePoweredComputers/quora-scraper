            "answer_text": "I use libraries very much, and I also buy books a lot. Different levels of distribution allow me to choose what I need the most case by case.  I usually buy books that I want to own as objects that I love: illustrated books, favourite authors, essays I need to study. I buy books to do what I please (underline them, study them for a long time, etc.). I go to the library when I'm curious about a book but I don't want to spend money on it; when I want some fiction that I will not be interested in anymore after I finished reading it; when I need to study something and I need a quick access to some resource, mostly the ones which are hardest to find. I buy ebooks (rarely) only when the price is worth, and mostly only for fiction, because I like to read it on e-screen. Sometimes I like to save money with an ebook, and this is a nice compromise between buying the paper copy and borrowing from the library. Bottom line is: all systems of distribution are equally useful if they can adapt to the different needs a reader might have. ",
