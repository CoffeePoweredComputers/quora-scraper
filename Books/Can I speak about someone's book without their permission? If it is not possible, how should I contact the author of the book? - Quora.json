            "answer_text": "Speak about it? Of course you can do that. Review and criticism are absolutely allowed, as is discussion of a book\u2019s plot, theme, and other literary elements. If it were only possible to discuss a book with permission from the author, you\u2019d never see a negative review. That\u2019s not a particularly good outcome, even though some authors might be fond of it. You are absolutely allowed to express your thoughts about any work, including a book. In most jurisdictions, there is even an exception to copyright (called \u201cfair use\u201d in the US, and by numerous other names worldwide) that permits you to use small portions from a copyrighted work to illustrate one\u2019s point in a review. So if, for example, your review is that the dialogue is lackluster and stilted, you could generally include a short snippet of dialogue from the book to illustrate exactly what you\u2019re talking about.

            "answer_text": "it is fine to speak of their work, even quoting it as long as you attribute the statement or research to them. That is what footnotes are for in journalistic articles on a particular subject. Often new works are built on deriving consensus or refuting prior publication. Be meticulous in your use of their work and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems. ",
