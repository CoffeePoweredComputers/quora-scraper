            "answer_text": "A library is a collection of books and materials. A personal library can consist of a few books or a collection of hundreds. An elementary school classroom library can consist of only enough books for the children in that classroom. An elementary school library can consist of whatever number of books that school district can afford. One hundred? Five hundred? A few thousand? A public library that serves a small community may have a smaller collection than a larger central library. A university library may hold many thousands of volumes. And then, there\u2019s the Library of Congress. In my opinion, there is no set amount of volumes that are needed to be considered a library. ",

            "answer_text": " This is the Google definition of library, and as you can see, it is a collection, primarily of books though I believe it can be any media. It isn't quantity that defines a library; it's content. A library can be your only copy of your personal dictionary, if it's a resource you use. It can be your bible, your set of encyclopedias, your collected works of Shakespeare\u2026 or your comic books. You don't even need a building, or a room, or books. I have a mental library of jokes, for example. My roommate has a library of DVDs. I guess what you need to make a library -and how much- depends on you. ",
