            "answer_text": "Anyone can publish a book, and it doesn\u2019t cost any money to do so. First, you need to write the book.  That\u2019s the easy part. Next, you can use free tools like LibreOffice with the Writer2ePub extension to create your formatted book. Create your (full size) cover - front, back, and spine using a graphics design program like iDraw, Photoshop, etc.  Export the whole thing to a PDF file, and export the cover to a .jpg file. In LibreOffice export it to PDF and create the ePub file (you\u2019ll need the .jpg file of the cover). If you have any changes to the file, you can use free tools like Sigil to edit the ePub file. Once you\u2019ve finished your edits, use Kindlegen to create the Amazon file. You\u2019ve now got the cover and interior files (in PDF format) that you\u2019re going to upload to Createspace to make your physical book. You\u2019ve also got the ePub file that you\u2019re going to upload to Smashwords to distribute to Barnes & Noble, Apple iBookstore, and everywhere except Amazon. Finally, you\u2019ve got the Amazon ebook file that you\u2019re going to upload to Kindle Direct Publishing.  Once you do that, you\u2019ve put your book out pretty much everywhere in the world. And the cost? Zero.  Zip. Zilch.  Nada.  You\u2019re a published author. Now, you can (and should) spend money getting a cover professionally done.  You should also get your book edited. Now comes the hard part: you have to market your book.  The good news is that there are plenty of places to get help doing this.  Alli is a great resource. BookBub is a great thing to look into.  Amazon has a Select program that - if used correctly - can greatly increase your sales.  Goodbooks is a place to review. As far as the other stuff mentioned:  You don\u2019t have to register your book with any \u201cISBN agency\u201d nor do you have to pay for any ISBN number.  Createspace, KDP, and Smashwords all offer free ISBN numbers.To create a physical book, you don\u2019t have to send any text or any artwork anywhere.  You can do it all in LibreOffice.  You don\u2019t have to have any batches printed, and there\u2019s no upfront cost to set up your book through Createspace.  None at all.Do NOT use Calibre to create your eBook; Amazon has rejected Calibre formatted ebooks.Do NOT send any kind of file to Kindle Direct Publishing (not Amazon).  Send only the Kindlegen generated file.  NEVER send Word or TXT files to KDP.  They will not get formatted correctly, and Word files are full of \u201cWord Bloat\u201d - a nice way of saying that Word fills your file with all kinds of unnecessary formatting.You don\u2019t \u201cregister\u201d your book (or eBook) with Amazon.  You set up an account at Createspace, Kindle Direct Publishing, and Smashwords.  You upload your file. That\u2019s it; no \u201cregister\u201d stuff involved.You don\u2019t need (or want) to \u2018crowdfund\u2019 your work.  Write it and publish it yourself.  That way you don\u2019t have to fulfill any crowdfunding promises.  If you add up all the money you spend doing fulfillment for crowdfunding projects, you\u2019ll find out that you end up with about 1/5 of the money your \u201craised\u201d crowdfunding.Googling \u201cself-publishing\u201d - while a good idea to get an overview - isn\u2019t really going to help you.  If you follow the advice given, you\u2019ll end up buying ISBN numbers, spending money on printer/distributors, and wasting both time and money doing things the wrong way.  You really need to find someone who can give you advice or help sherpa you through the (many) pitfalls of doing things the wrong way.Also, you NEVER EVER send your book to an agent.  You send a query letter.  No legitimate agent will accept an unsolicited manuscript; it goes right in the shredder.  The Writers Digest has a list of agencies if you want to go the traditional route.  Just know in advance that the \u201ctraditional\u201d route will net you about 14.5% in royalties per book sale.  Going the indie-publishing route will get you much closer to 70% royalties - and you\u2019ll have to do the same amount of marketing.",

            "answer_text": "In order to try to sell your book you will need an agent.  An agent has the contacts to pitch your book to the publishing houses.  One good site to try is www dot querytracker dot com.  Find literary agents and publishers with our free database. That is a free website that lists agents and publishers and tells you which ones take which genres and what their requirements are and how to submit to them. Not every agent in the world is listed here but there's around 1400 of them on this site. Do your homework and find publishers on that site that take on new writers that don't have an agent. Query them.  If you don't know what a query letter is Google it...there are many sites that show you how to write that letter.  Smaller publishing houses may be more willing to take a chance on a new writer than one from the Big 5.  To get the attention of an agent or editor you MUST write a book they want to represent. With that said, only query the ones that represent the genre your book is in. That makes sense, right?  Someone who only represents romance novels doesn't want to hear a pitch for a mystery. The query letter is the industry standard. Learn to write a killer query that hooks the agent and makes him/her want to read your work. I always (even though it says not to) include the first 5 pages of my ms (manuscript) along with the query. If they are interested, they will read them. If they read the first few pages and I can hook them, I'll get a request for a partial, which is 3 chapters. So there's your in... a killer query and a grab-em-by-the-throat first five pages. Just make sure the rest of the ms (manuscript) is as good as the first 5 pages. ",

            "answer_text": "Follow all the steps (outlined in hundreds, if not thousands, of easily located blogs and websites).  When your book is polished and edited, then go through all the documented steps for publishing (still easy to find plenty of advice). When writing your query letter (go look it up), if your age makes your book more sellable, then include it as an asset. For example, if your story is about a person of your own age and includes information you specifically encountered. If Anne Frank had lived to submit her diary, a publisher would certainly consider her age and personal experiences an asset to the book. If your age has no particular relevance to the book's content, then don't mention it. That includes any books written for children, middle-grade, or young adult. Unless your own experience is pertinent, you shouldn't mention your age until necessary. If a publisher or agent shows interest, you should then reveal your age and indicate you have a parent who will be the responsible contract signer since kids under 18 cannot legally sign an enforceable contract. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "In simplest words, you can go for self-publishing or traditional publishing. Traditional publishing has been explained by User-13574788118874627179, so my advice in terms of self-publishing is as follows: a. Complete the book. b. Sit on it for some time, preferably around a month. You do nothing about it. Try to be too busy on other projects or work. c. Re-read it and edit it. Because first drafts almost always are. Repeat \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 until you are satisfied. d. (Optional) Release the initial chapters on online reading-writing site, like Wattpad or Fiction or some other site, so that you can get feedback on whether it is interesting enough (and some more grammar testing). e. Look into publishing via Smashwords, Amazon or some other such site. (I recommend Smashwords because of multiple distribution channels). Also, promote your book. (The reader base from step \u2018d\u2019 will be very helpful here.) f. Cry, if you did all this for money. Because unless you turn out to be a hidden gem with a best-seller, you won\u2019t be earning enough for anything. ",

He and his family did self publish, but that proves that a young adult can write a book that is commercially successful. Less important than your age is the quality of the writing and story. An editor can be a great resource to guide you, sometimes an author can be too close to their own work and overlook flaws. Good luck with your book! ",
