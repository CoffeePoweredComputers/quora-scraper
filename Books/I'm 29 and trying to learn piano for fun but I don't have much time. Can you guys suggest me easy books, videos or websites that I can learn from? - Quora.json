            "answer_text": "Congratulations! Welcome to the wonderful world of playing piano! Unfortunately I have to reiterate the advice of my peers here in that you will need to commit some time to it if you want to gain pleasure out of this pursuit. BUT, I don\u2019t believe that it needs to be as much time as some people think. You need to put the time in, keep the inspirational juices flowing, find a course or learning resource that has a clear learning pathway, and find a support network of like-minded people rooting for you\u2026 without these elements to your learning it will all be over very quickly. 50% of piano students give up in the first two years.[1] So there\u2019s a milestone to reach and get beyond! In terms of how much time you\u2019ll need to put in - you can use something called \u201cmicro-practise\u201d which is a small amount of time (10\u201320 minutes) every day, don\u2019t miss a day! This is much better than a marathon hours long session once or twice a week as it mirrors the way our brains work and backup information, each day when we go to sleep. Here is an estimate of how long it takes to reach each level of piano learning based on my own teaching experience and my own online piano courses - if you spend roughly 10 minutes a day on learning and practising: STAGE 1: \u2018Prepare To Play\u2019 a free mini-course that prepares you for your piano journey. This delivers emails to your inbox and gives you the five major obstacles all pianists face and how to overcome them (hint, lack of time is one of them). Time to complete: 8 days. STAGE 2: \u2018Super Basics\u2019 a foundational course that takes you from no learning previously (or a little) to a working knowledge of the essentials of piano playing. Time to complete: self-paced learning but anywhere between 7\u201314 days. STAGE 3: \u2018Songs By Ear\u2019 an in-depth course that teaches how to teach yourself many of the popular songs you hear on the radio. Time to complete: 21-30 days approx. So you can see that in a matter of roughly 2 months you can go from absolutely no knowledge to sitting at a piano playing your favourite pop/rock/blues (insert favourite genre here) songs. In terms of what to learn and where to go to learn it, I agree with other answers in that you should find one course or curriculum that really resonates with you - is with an instructor that you can follow and feel you can trust, with a learning path that is clear and takes you to where you want to go (ie promises \u201cin the end you will be able to\u2026.\u201d). Don\u2019t waste time on cobbling together free resources from YouTube and the web, this will lead to frustration when you don\u2019t know what to move onto next. The key is to invest in a program that you know will take you in the right direction so that once you\u2019re on that path you don\u2019t need to worry about making any more decisions. Check out my course and see if it lines up with your particular goals here: pianopicnic.com I held an online workshop + Q&A on this very topic recently. I\u2019ve made the recording available here so you didn\u2019t miss out! Get access here. ***Got more questions about learning piano?

            "answer_text": "I would suggest you make time if it really matters to you. No website, book or video will substitute for commitment. You can learn the essentials of standard music theory, including how to read notes and chords, in an afternoon if you commit to understanding it. You must commit to using your mind, thinking, applying the concepts you\u2019ve integrated- which means playing, understanding why and how you play this or that key at which time. Then you will learn, and very quickly. You must also understand that not all piano teachers, writings, websites or texts are equally good. Some will be good, some will be bad, and you have to understand which are which. The good ones build up logically; the bad ones throw out a bunch of stuff at you in a disorderly fashion. You should ideally stick to one, the one most objective and logical, instead of trying out a bunch of different methods. You should generally seek to learn from the best, even if they sometimes make mistakes. ",
