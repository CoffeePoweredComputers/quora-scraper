            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t say which series it was for the sake of not spoiling it, but I read the first book some time ago and loved it. The plot was intriguing and fresh, the characters were wonderfully real, and the writing was gripping. It had all the potential to become one of my new favorite series. I moved on to the second book and was slapped in the face with reality when my dear favorite character died suddenly. She was beautiful and smart and young and brave and everything desirable, and she died\u2014I don\u2019t even remember how. I remember literally going through the five stages of grief over this incredible character, starting with the belief that she would somehow be resurrected later in the book. I tentatively read the next few chapters, and the rest of the characters moved on. I knew there was no hope of seeing her again. I raged at the author for making such a pointlessly cruel decision. I wondered vaguely if there was any way I could have avoided coming across this tragedy. I was sad for a long time. Now, I\u2019ve read about death before, but this was just so sudden and pointless! I finally quit reading the second book, partly to spite the author, partly because there was little point in reading the rest of the story if my favorite character was not there to see the happy ending. That\u2019s the only time in my life I\u2019ve stopped reading a book because it was too sad, and I don\u2019t expect something like that to happen again. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.  This book made me cry. It is about the true stories of 8 children who survived the Nazi concentration camps. No names or situations were changed in this book. It's a fact that the holocaust was a terrible phase in history ,but just how terrible comes through in this book. When you read about a child living in the most unhygenic conditions , barely getting enough to eat,not knowing if they will live to see another day;your heart just goes out to them. The most heart breaking story was that of a brother and sister ,George and Ursula. They were both sent to Westerbrock camp. George was 14 years and Ursula 8 years. They were only given a piece of bread to eat. Sometimes a guard would take pity and give George an extra slice. He would divide it and always take the bigger piece . He felt that he was bigger and needed his strength to take care of Ursula. But he always felt guilty. Every night they would pick out lice from their clothes. George would sometimes comb Ursula's hair,which had become grey due to malnutrition. George weighed only 34 kg and Ursula was a walking skeleton. They were later shifted to Bergen-Belsen. Then one day the allies came and liberated the camp. George got a big loaf of bread and this time he gave the bigger half to his sister. They walked to the town of Trobitz. But since their bodies were infested with lice they both got the typhus fever. Ultimately they survived and lived their lives. I stopped reading this book. Later though I did complete it. Because it is important that their stories don't go in vain. It is important to know that hope can exist in the most devastating of situations. It is important that we don't forget history and make the same mistakes. It's important that we remember . ",
