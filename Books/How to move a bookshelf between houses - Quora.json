Using two people to lift, one at each end, pick it up and carefully move it to where you want it to be (use a moving van or truck).  Put it down.  Replace the shelves (if removed previously) and the books. Small bookshelves can be moved by a single person.  Large ones, and those constructed out of heavy materials, may require a dolly. ",

Guide the bookcase onto a large dolly, the kind used to move refrigerators. Strap it in place. Guide or lift onto a truck and drive it to the place you want it to go. Reverse steps. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is IKEA or some other brand of assembled furniture, can it be disassembled? If not, call a friend who owns a minivan, large SUV, or pickup truck. Additionally, it could possibly be hauled on a roof rack. If all that is undoable or too inconvenient, find a new one. But you are going to have to transport that one somehow as well. ",
