            "answer_text": "It depends on why you\u2019re doing it. If you just want to switch of they style in which you\u2019re writing, maybe do that somewhere that isn\u2019t a direct sequel. Of course, even then you can still do it. You\u2019ll just have to give a reason for the shift to your readers. This is easier if you\u2019re doing it for story purposes. A shift in perspective grounded in the story can both explain the change and provide an interesting shift for your readers. ",

If the reason is only \u201cin hindsight I wish that I wrote the first book in first person too\u201d, then don\u2019t switch. But if you aim to highlight a trait of the protagonist that wasn\u2019t visible in the first book because it was written in third person, then by all means do it! ",
