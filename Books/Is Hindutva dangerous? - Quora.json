            "answer_text": "As much of a vocal critic I have been of the Hindutva, I strongly believe that Hindutva is not dangerous. The original goal of Hindutva is to unite everybody in the Indian subcontinent, keeping aside caste and religious differences in order to form a national identity. Forming a national identity is especially important for Indians because India is already a loose amalgamation of multiple cultures and ethnicities. So, it runs the risk of disintegrating into multiple nations, unless a strong nationalistic sentiment is put in place. The biggest problem with disintegrating into multiple nations is China, which is a huge culturally homogeneous nation state that is right next door; with plenty of philosophical differences with India. If India is fragmented based on cultures and ethnicity, that would make it a lot easier for China to dominate or annex India. In the modern day however, the old and popular Hindutva movement has been taken over by vultures. Vultures are small groups of people who hack through existing institutions to better serve themselves. This why They try to antagonize minorities such as Muslims and Christians.Then, they try to antagonize less traditional people through moral policing (lynching people who kiss in public, celebrate valentines day etc)Antagonize people who eat meat.Antagonize people who criticize mandatory teaching of Puranas and Vedas in schools.Mandating Sanskrit studies in IITs while condemning French and German classes in schools and so on.From the way fringe members of Hindutva pick enemies, you can easily discern a pattern, which is the domination of our institutions by the upper-castes. This isn\u2019t to say all upper-castes are vultures. This simply means, the fringe group interested in self-service consists of the upper castes who want to bring back caste hierarchies. This group of vultures may have as well had any other goal that was equally abominable. Like the Hindutva is today, literally any organization or ideology faces the risk of being taken over by vultures. Even seemingly benign and altruistic movements could be taken over by vultures. For example in the early 19th century, Karl Marx introduced socialism to bring justice to the working class. Yet, in about half a century, Russia was taken over by communism! Many genocides followed in countries like Russia, Cambodia, Ukraine and Korea; all in the name of \u201csocial justice\u201d. History has shown that it\u2019s a common pattern.  Which shows that Hindutva itself is not dangerous. The people dominating the institutions allied with Hindutva, definitely are! ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Originally: Is Hindutva dangerous? Hindutva is an ideology based on promoting India as a \u2018Hindu rashtra\u2019, while removing all the laws that protect minority religions, the converts to minority religions, the people hoping to convert from Hinduism to other religions and their practices. It is an attempt to bully the minorities into becoming a submissive group and to create a land where liberal and progressive values are undermined. The RSS, will gain huge amounts of unquestioned powers due to the unconstitutional measures passed by the Hindutva brigade around India. Only the states that are run by regional parties will be able to escape from the tyrannical powers of the gunda raj that these people choose to unleash on the unsuspecting populace of the nation. The worst part about all this is that none of this is representative of the values and teachings of Hinduism and brings a bad reputation to not just the religion, but its followers and the nation on the whole. Any authoritarian power that consolidates power and uses it to bully people is not a good thing. This is what is happening in Turkey too. The government over reaches and will use the power to discriminate and subjugate. The extremes of this was seen in Germany in 1945, USSR under Stalin, Yugoslavia under Tito, Spain under Franco, Uganda under Idi Amin, China under Mao and so on. While most of these are individual dictators, the state machinery was used to restrict freedoms, to curb free speech, to promote nationalism, to pit the population against any ideas deemed to be different and dangerous, to reduce the mobility of the population and to keep the population subjugated. These can be seen in India already - Sedition laws, laws curbing religious conversions, laws that restrict religions other than Hindus to publicly offer prayers or sermons, banning beef, disallowing people to withdraw money beyond a certain sum are all aimed at stripping away our fundamental freedoms. What is more, a large number of Indians, mostly youth are supporting the moves to rip our constitutional rights to shreds, without question and without a fight. This is scary, since this is how dictators and fascist governments were formed. This is how the Hitlers and Mussolini\u2019s came to power and stripped their nations of their dignity and their respect in the world. There is still hope for India, but we must stand for what is right and for our freedoms because if we don\u2019t no one else will. ",
