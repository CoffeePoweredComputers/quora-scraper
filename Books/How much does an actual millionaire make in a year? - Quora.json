            "answer_text": "MOST PEOPLE ARE GUESSING, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I AND MY FRIENDS EARN. We say someone is Millionaire by the cars they drive or their house, right? If some is saving pennies and investing then He/she is not a millionaire! You should make at lest $100k per month in profit to be called a Millionaire or buy nice cars and stuff. And if you do the math then it is just $3,333 per day! It is not that hard to make 3 grand per day, believe me I know teenagers who do it. No I am not talking about those famous kids doing review of toys :) Their are a lot of kids who don\u2019t waste time on asking these question and found a Free Training here and there which is normally not know to most people! I am saying is the best stuff online to make money is least viewed! You need to search really hard to find the Gold, I Have some golden videos in my Bio but still their is a lot you can learn which is Deep in the internet. With $100k you can but lambos, rolls royce etc I also have a Ferrari. It is not that hard, the only problem is those who know how to do it will never tell you on YouTube! ",

            "answer_text": "Most millionaires probably make below $200k per year. Remember, keep in mind that there are most millionaires are worth less than $10m, and most people worth over $10m are worth less than $100m and most people worth more than $100m are not billionaires and so on. Getting back to the question, I would say the typical millionaire makes over 6 figures per year, but not a \u201chefty\u201d six figures like say over $500k per year. Many millionaires make more than this, but most actually don\u2019t. Most save and invest their way into wealth on a moderate or maybe a bit high of a salary or something. Many can be business owners too. ",
