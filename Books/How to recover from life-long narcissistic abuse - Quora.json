            "answer_text": "Get therapy. It will cut your recovery time down drastically. You\u2019ll need an impartial third party to help you make sense of everything, especially in the early days of recovery. Read Quora, and you\u2019ll learn exactly who you were dealing with, the good, the bad, the ugly, and stop blaming yourself for everything. You\u2019ll see that people with NPD use the same coping mechanisms over and over. It wasn\u2019t you, specifically, that caused them to go into devaluation and discard. These are their coping mechanisms, their default tools. It was going to happen regardless of what you did or didn\u2019t do. Learn what the tools are, so that you can recognize them when you see them in action again. Understand that it\u2019s easy to be vulnerable to narcissists, because they are charming, sexy, fun, they offer you the world, but then they drop you into the pits of hell. You need to know the tools they use, so you don\u2019t fall victim to them again. Ignore your narcissist when you can, both the tirades and the rants and then the sweet and nice things they\u2019ll say to you, to get you involved in whatever\u2019s going on with them currently. You may not be able to ignore them completely, if you have a child or shared business, but if you can\u2019t, then only discuss what you need to discuss with them. Don\u2019t get sucked into any longer conversation. And try to get all your conversations in writing. You have to believe, deep in your heart, that they are no longer your problem. It\u2019s not up to you to save them, to fix them, or to fix their problems for them. They\u2019re not going to appreciate anything nice you do for them. The minute you\u2019re out of hearing range, they\u2019ll twist it around, and present it completely differently to everyone else. From this moment forward, they are just a business deal, an unemotional transaction. They are nobody to you. Because, believe me, you are NOBODY to them. You are worse than nobody. You are the broken toy that they feel contempt and anger for, until you become useful again. And then they\u2019ll hide that contempt and anger, and play nice. But you have to know, deep down, it\u2019s a manipulation, it\u2019s not real. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to go no contact, but if you can\u2019t go no contact, keep it boring and professional. Even if you\u2019ve spent most of your life with them, they\u2019re not your lovers, they\u2019re not your friends, they\u2019re not your acquaintances. They\u2019re nothing more than your business associates until your children turn 18, or until you can part ways with them if you have shared business interests. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard. Because they meant everything to you during your relationship, and it\u2019s really hard to come to terms with the fact that you meant, and continue to mean, nothing to them. You may mourn the relationship with your narcissist, but it\u2019s a one-sided emotion. Narcissists feel nothing but contempt, annoyance and anger for you\u2014when they bother to think about you at all\u2014especially after devaluation and discard. You are nothing to them. You are a broken toy they\u2019ve replaced with a non-broken (yet) toy. And the healing starts when you can accept that, when you can let the pain of that go, when you can let them go. Let go of the dreams of what might have been (because it was never going to happen). Let go of the great love (it was never real, it was just a tool). Let go of the ego that tells you that you must have meant something to them after all those years together (you didn\u2019t\u2014all that was important to them was what you could do for them). You have to let it all go and get to the point where you can walk away without leaving bits and pieces of your heart behind. And that\u2019s when you can start healing. ",

            "answer_text": "One step at a time\u2026. Get to a place of safety \u2013 both physically, emotionally and financially. You can\u2019t really start your healing when you are still being wounded. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of indirect abuse \u2013 triangulation by third parties, isolation, the smear campaign, denigration to employers, etc. Mitigate all the types of abuse that could possibly be going on.Self-validate. Learn about NPD in great detail, seeking to understand what exactly happened, why, and what your role in it was. Not only will this help you come to terms with the abuse, but it is also an essential step in ensuring that you never fall foul of a toxic relationship again.Be wary. Your friends and loved ones will have your best interests at heart. But NPD abuse is so counter-intuitive that the solutions to resolve it are also very counter-intuitive - and you may well find that they are giving you the right tools, but for the wrong job, and that mismatch will confuse and demoralise you. Give yourself permission to disagree with well-intentioned advice if it does not sit right with you.Split your team. Sadly very few people understand NPD abuse, and so don\u2019t expect anyone who has not been abused themselves first hand to know what you have been through, or what sort of support that you need moving forward. I would recommend separating out general support from the NPD-specific encouragement and work that you need to do. Save the more serious, complicated and tiring \u201cwork\u201d for those who get NPD abuse, and whose support is specifically aimed at working on the NPD solutions.Get healthy. You have a journey ahead of you, and I\u2019m afraid that it is arduous. It is so important that you build and maintain good levels of physical and mental health. Eat healthily, exercise plenty, surround yourself in nature, meditate, avoid alcohol or drugs.Identify and resolve the prior inner wound. To have fallen foul of a toxic relationship in the first place, there is a good chance that you had a predisposition to it in the first place. Are you a people pleaser? Why did you want to heal that person? Why did you put their needs ahead of your own? Did you have any boundaries, and if so, were they porous? All these issues need to be resolved as part of moving forward.Unwind negative beliefs. The psychological abuse incurred during the devaluation and discard phases is incredibly damaging. From passive-aggressive remarks to outright insults, a lack of empathy and appreciation to regular verbal and emotional abuse, a sustained campaign of gaslighting to the deprivation of hobbies and relationships that boosted your self-esteem and confidence \u2013 your sense of self will have taken the mother of all beatings for a very long time. Even the strongest willed victims will have adopted a series of negative belief systems, all of which need to be unwound. The foundations for many of these will have been set in early childhood \u2013 a double whammy for those seeking to recover from abuse later in adult life.Let go. We carry around so much baggage that we have collected throughout a toxic relationship \u2013 and probably from childhood onwards. Pain, guilt, resentment, hatred \u2013 all understandable, but nevertheless corrosive feelings and emotions that limit our ability to move on and enjoy a more positive life. Letting go is not easy \u2013 but it can, and must, be done.Surrender. This might be an odd thing to say, coming from an ex-army office that is devoting his life to combatting NPD. But don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I am not suggesting for a second that you should surrender to abuse \u2013 but that you should surrender to fate. No-one promised that our lives would be rosey. No-one promised eternal wealth and happiness. There was never any guarantee of kindness and intimacy forever. \u2018Til death do us part makes a lovely wedding vow, but sometimes people break promises. Those aspirations of being the perfect parents to your wonderful kids don\u2019t always come true regardless of how hard you try for your part. So rather than battle these preconceived ideas and feel the unbearable pain as they slip away from you, surrender to fate. Understand that shit happens, and that things happen for a reason. That reason won\u2019t be clear to you now \u2013 but just know that it will turn out for the better. Don\u2019t swim against the tide of fate \u2013 but surrender to it, allowing it to take you to a new place.Turn predator. You don\u2019t need to run from your abuser forever. Once you\u2019re in a good place \u2013 physically and mentally strong, wise, well-supported and resourced, you have the power and control to turn the tables on your abuser should you so wish and/or need. You will be surprised just how weak they are under that charade of charm and charisma, bluff and bile. By knowing your strengths, and their vulnerabilities, there is nothing to stop you ceasing to be their prey, and instead transforming into their predator. And you have truth on your side \u2013 own it.Surround yourself with uplift. We spark off people \u2013 either well or badly. You will have got into a routine where your interactions with your narc were damaging, debilitating and will have sent you into a downward spiral. Your choice friends, family, work colleagues and team mates who you surround yourself have an enormous bearing on your well-being \u2013 choose wisely. From your general friends and supporters look to derive happiness, fun, enjoyment and normality. Try and participate and be upbeat in group dynamics. Pursue hobbies and past times that make you happy and feel rewarded.Establish a new you. The reality is that \u201cYou\u201d will never be the same after narcissistic abuse \u2013 it is so toxic and damaging that it is very likely that the scars will last for life. But that it is not to say that a new you is not possible, and one who is stronger, wiser, kinder, more self-assured, more driven \u2013 and one who benefits from increased joy and abundance in every aspect of their life. All of this is possible with the right sort of work. Establishing an identity can be a very daunting task \u2013 it is something we should have achieved in childhood, at which time we had the support of teachers, friends and family. People recognise that kids are still developing and make allowances accordingly. As an adult, it is difficult to have that luxury \u2013 one is expected to maintain the air of a rounded and confident grownup to the outside world even if you are a complete mess inside. So the chances are that you will need to do all of that healing in private, behind the charade of fully functioning human-being.Find a companion for the journey. You\u2019ve never walked this path before, and you probably don\u2019t know the route. Consider engaging a walking partner for the journey, who knows what you\u2019ve gone through, who can empathise, who is supportive, who is wise. Someone to pick you up when you\u2019re down and champion and celebrate your successes when you\u2019re up. Someone who will you keep you walking, one step at a time.Be patient. Don\u2019t underestimate what you\u2019ve been through, or the amount of work to be done to get you back on track. Take one step at a time. Forgive yourself for relapses. Go easy on yourself. It all takes time\u2026..Thanks for the A2A. Are you on a journey of recovery? Do follow me, I write exclusively on the subject. And if you think it might be useful to others, please share.
