            "answer_text": "Train to Pakistan is an historical novel written by Khashwant Singh about an actual event known as the Partition of India which happened in 1947. India, once part of the British Empire, bartered its help to fight in World War II for its independence, so Britain withdrew from India in 1947. Before doing so, British authorities divided the country into two parts, essentially based on religions: Hindu and Muslim. Unfortunately, most Hindus did not live in the Hindu (India) section, and most Muslims did not live in the Muslim (Pakistan) section. This required a dramatic exodus of people from one place to another--10 million people crossed the \"partition\" that summer. The two places were divided for a reason; the religious factions and ethnic hatred ran deep between these two groups. Not surprisingly, violence ensued; 2 million people died in the chaos created by this division and this move. The British had been in control for so long that the local authorities were not strong enough to maintain order. The fictional town of Mano Majra is the setting for this story. Though the town itself was relatively peaceful, the train station becomes the epicenter of conflict during the Partition. A local group of Sikhs to incite anti-Muslim violence and sabotage the train which was to transport the Muslims to Pakistan. Three men are the key players in what happens next. Hukum Chand is a powerful but corrupt authority figure. He is constantly trying to rid himself of guilt for his unethical and even evil treatment of the Muslims and Hindus. This is often represented by two geckos (lizards) fighting one another. Hukum Chand felt as if he had touched the lizards and they had made his hands dirty. He rubbed his hands on the hem of his shirt. It was not the sort of dirt which could be wiped off or washed clean. Symbolically, he simply wants to wash or wipe away his guilt, but of course he is unsuccessful. Iqbal Singh is a rather Britain-ized social reformer, small in stature, who is more interested in politics than people. Juggat Singh is Iqbal's physical opposite and is known to react before he thinks things through. He is a local thug connected to violence and gangs. Both are in prison for a murder they did not commit, and when Chand learns of the Sikhs' plot, he sends Iqbal and Juggat (out of guilt) to prevent the disaster. Rather than doing anything personally to help, Chand turns to alcohol, another of his strategies to escape his guilt. He is representative of those who had some kind of power to help but chose not to avoid the problem. Iqbal spends pages of the novel in philosophical meanderings but never takes any actions. He, too, could have done something but spent his time just thinking about what would be the right thing to do. Only Juggat acts without thinking and manages to foil the plot, though he loses his life in the process. The train went over him, and went on to Pakistan. In the end we understand two things. First, everyone is to blame for this entire tragedy because they did not value the humanity of others more than they valued other, less important things. Second, everyone has a choice. These three men represent most people's choices when it comes to standing for what is right and good and moral. In effect, they serve as a microcosm of all people in the world when faced with a significant choice. All three of them could have prevented the tragedy, but it would have cost them their loves. One avoids, one overthinks himself into inaction, and only one does the right thing. Sounds about right. ",

            "answer_text": "Train To Pakistan is a wonderful novel by Khushwant Singh that revolves around the Partition of India in 1947. The story ends with the heroic and sacrificial rescue of the train headed towards Pakistan by an unknown person. Although that mysterious person is shot down and mutilated by the train , it is said that he was successful in cutting the rope. Thus it can be safely assumed that no one was killed and the train safely went on to Pakistan. Now regarding the mysterious hero ; On the course of the story we see that only three people know about the plot to slaughter the Train To Pakistan and slay the Muslims in a bloodbath. (Excluding the subinspector , Meet Singh and Malli and his Gang ) Hukum Chand who knew about the plan but decided to avoid taking any action.Iqbal who talked himself to believe that it would be best for him to remain neutral. \u201cIn such circumstances what can you do but cultivate an utter indifference to all values.\u201dLastly there was Juggut Singh . He most aptly fits the description of the mysterious hero. There are many reasons to believe that he was the one to save the train.Firstly , it was stressed from the beginning of the novel that Juggut Singh was a incredibly tall and well built man. The mysterious hero was described as a big man. \u201cHis feet were near the knot; his hands almost reached the centre of the rope. He was a big man.\u201dJust before the rescue of the train Juggut Singh had gone to Bhai Meet Singh to pray and hear some lines from the Guru Granth. This symbolized he was going to do something big and important as he did not usually attend the sermons but came to the gurudwara at an odd time to pray.No one else had a deep relation with anyone in the train. Of course the people used to consider the Muslims as their brothers and were good friends with them , but unlike them Jugga was in love with one of the people on that train , Nooro with his child in her womb. Jugga being the daring Sikh he is , would not hesitate in giving up his life for them.Thus it can be said that Juggut Singh at the end was the mysterious hero who saved many Muslims in the Train To Pakistan. Hope my answer helps!! :) ",
