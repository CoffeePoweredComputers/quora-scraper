            "answer_text": "Yes, NCERT\u2019s Chemistry is enough for the JEE Mains exam. However there are a few things that one must understand first. Chemistry has three parts i.e. Physical, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. I will describe each part and how to study it using the NCERT separately. INORGANIC CHEMISTRY: It is most scoring part of the three but requires a lot of mugging specifically when p block, s block, d & f block, environmental chemistry and hydrogen are concerned. NCERT is more than sufficient for all these topics if one learns each and every point, fact, example and reaction given in these chapters by heart. Also, there are 2 -3 questions that are direct lines of the NCERT especially from the chapters s block, environmental chemistry, hydrogen and d & f block. However, for the chapters such as Chemical bonding, Coordination compounds and metallurgy one must go for class notes along with the NCERT book. There are some analytical questions asked in Inorganic which usually aspirants are not able to solve only studying NCERT. Solving a good problem book such as VK Jaiswal (Shri Balaji) or Problem book for Inorganic Chemistry by Wiley will provide additional advantage.PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY: There are usually 2 theory based questions in the Mains paper from physical chemistry which may be direct lines of the NCERT (Surface chemistry, Chemistry in Everyday life). But most of the questions are numerical questions and thus requires ample practice for which one needs to solve a good problem book such as the one by Mr. N Awasthi published by Shri Balaji publications or Problems & solutions in Physical Chemistry by Pearson. One can also go for modules of any reputed institute such as RESONANCE, ALLEN or FIITJEE. The chapters mole concept, stochiometry & redox (reaction based claculations), electro-chemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics, solutions & colligative properties need more practice than others.ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: It is the most trickiest part of the three. There are 2- 3 questions in the JEE Mains that are direct lines from the NCERT especially for the chapters Biomolecules, polymers, Some basic techniques and principle. But all other questions that are asked are mostly mechanism based and need thorough understanding of each mechanism along with the action of all reagents and the effect of the environment on them. So, for organic Chemistry one must go for class notes or institute modules or some reference book such as K S Verma (cengage) and solving a good problem book is a must e.g. MS Chouhan (Shri balaji).I hope the answer is explanatory enough for the question.

            "answer_text": "I got 100/120 in Chemistry from NCERT only. I attempted all questions: I got 26 correct and 4 wrong. For the ones I got wrong: I could have got 3 of them right if I had not forgotten the obscure detail from NCERT that they referred to -- yep, all I had to do was recall an exact line... some stupid fact from those idiotic chapters at the end of the book (Chemistry in Everyday Life and whatnot)The other one question was an understanding fault on my part (ie. a problem-solving shortcoming)Only one question was truly outside NCERT, and even that was solvable using concepts from NCERT Physics and Chemistry together (I assume you study NCERT Physics if you are doing JEE); I approached it correctly, got it wrong due to slightly wrong reasoning on my part, but then they admitted that my wrong reasoning was due to some ambiguity and so I got the marks. The lesson here is not to forget the other subjects while solving one subject, and to stay calm.For the ones I got right: about 50% were direct NCERT lines, or problem types directly solved in NCERT/assigned in NCERT Exercises/Exemplar Problems/Intext Questions.about 30% were problems that combined problem types from NCERT. The only skill required was to know when to apply which formula (though that's not how I did them -- I've always hated formulae)the rest were the ones that actually required the problem-solving skills which I tried to apply to the entire paper (because I hate mugging up); but even then the underlying concept was NCERT. For practicing problems, go for JEE Main/AIEEE past papers (30+ years) if you are weak in any part even after doing NCERT.Hence, do NCERT line-by-line, problem-by-problem. Remember the exact examples: direct recollection will not just save time, but you may even encounter direct questions from them.Good luck! Edit notes: Thanks to Sankalp Sahu for pointing out an error in my calculations of my score from my memory of what I got right and wrong. I have rechecked with my JEE Main paper and corrected it.
