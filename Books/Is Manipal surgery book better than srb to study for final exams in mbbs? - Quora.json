            "answer_text": "Hi. I passed by final year two years back. I think I can give you a good idea here. I had read significant parts of Bailey ( about 60%) in minor year. But I realized that if I need to write a good answer; I need to remember everything I read from Bailey. Since it wasn't helping I decided to opt for another book and I was spoilt for the same choice as you-I chose SRB. I don't regret it one bit. It's way better than Manipal; which back then was filled with mistakes ( the newer edition though I heard is better).The general surgery part of srb is very good. Though yes the problem with srb is that one day before the exam revising from it is slightly difficult. So try and make notes or do your marking well. My answer- SRB. Between SrB and Manipal. Ps- 30% of my answers though, were on long term memory from Bailey.Bailey is one heck of a book. ",
