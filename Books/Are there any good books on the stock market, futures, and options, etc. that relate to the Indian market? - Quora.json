            "answer_text": "Personally I have never read ANY BOOK on Stock Markets or Investing. I follow a few principles in investing: Buy and forgetBuy only after a THOROUGH ANALYSIS. This analysis may even take up 7\u201310 days, but only after you have done your homework, go ahead with the buy.Never, i repeat never, rely on suggestions.Be fearful when others are greedy i.e. Sell when stocks are at peak. Be a smart buyer when market is down.I follow a tendency of going through 52 week low stocks diligently. In case you find a good stock to buy there, wait for a couple of sessions, when the fall has stopped or the price has stabilised buy the stock.Futures, options are clever ways of making as well as losing money. Veteran investors like warren buffet advise strictly against it.Dont build up a portfolio of 20\u201340 stocks. Buy 4\u20135 quality companies, and forget. Whenever, the stock price falls, see it as an opportunity to buy more of such stocks.PS I have been an investor only for 1.5 years now. Also, I am pursuing CA, and auditing listed companies, hence this knowledge helps me in actually understanding and reading annual reports. Till today i have been able to unrealised profits of a very mediocre amount. However, i have learnt a lot from my mistakes. You can learn about stock markets only when you start investing. If you read a book, you might be aware of all the rules of swimming, but you definitely dont know how to swim. So my suggestion is open an account with a discount broker, with a small capital, and start investing. ",
