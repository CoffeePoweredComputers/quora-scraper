            "answer_text": "I love all the books. If you read them in order it is perfect. They are intended to take you from and eleven year old\u2019s point of view (HP and the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry was eleven) up to the Deathly Hallows when Harry was seventeen, and the book is written for a seventeen year old\u2019s level. So I can\u2019t place them in order of favorites other than the order they are in, because the books are perfectly in order. It would be akin to asking what Lord of the Rings book is the best. Well\u2026they all are if you read them in context and they all lead up to the end. Perfectly. So JK Rowling knew what she was doing. Read them in order and you will be taken from an innocent child\u2019s view of the world, though not a world without pain\u2026and go through that awkward phase with the characters and recall your own awkward years. Then go onto the blossoming of young adulthood with its responsibilities. They. Are. Perfect. Enjoy them. Spoiler alert now\u2026. Though I really do like Goblet of Fire. So much going on there. First dance. First faltering steps toward dating. Hosting other schools. Dreamy Cedric Diggory. Or dreamy Fleur Delacour, depending on your point of view. And the three tasks. Oooh. Spooky stuff. And Half Blood Prince. What? No more Dumbledore? Wha??! And that moment, that gut punch in The Deathly Hallows when we see how GOOD Snape was all those years since Harry was attacked. Perfection. Literary perfection. All the books in beautiful order designed by the author to be just that. Literary bliss. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, thier are two best to worst situations. One as in for HJarry, which was the worst year and which was the best, the other in us, which book was the most thrilling and which one the least thrilling. For us, the books, which were the most thrilling to the books which were the least thrilling. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Well, this is my order of the best books to the worst books, every one has different lists. Now, the order in the way Harry might have categorised his years from the best to worst. Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I guess that no one will argue with me in this list, will they, Harry\u2019s worst year had to be the seventh one, and the best had to be the first, as it was the year no one died, nothing bad happened and of course, Harry came to Hogwarts.

            "answer_text": "There is no definitive answer. It all comes down to what you, as a person, think. Personally, though, my books would be: Goblet of Fire - It\u2019s so boring.Prisoner of Azkaban - A dull read that provides me with nothing but convenient occurrences. What if Pettigrew was discovered by Harry with the map? What if Sirius\u2019 plan went wrong?Order of the Phoenix - It\u2019s so looooooooong. Also, Umbridge.Deathly Hallows - Read it a few too many times. I absolutely hate any part where they\u2019re camping. Also, Ron is even more of a dick than usual.Half-Blood Prince - Again, read it a few too many times. It\u2019s still a decent book nonetheless.Chamber of Secrets - A good book from start to finish but has a few odd moments and isn\u2019t very well knitted together.Philosopher\u2019s Stone - The original and the best. If only it had been longer! (Please not Order of the Phoenix-long, though\u2026)",
