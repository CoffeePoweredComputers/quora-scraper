            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not great, I wouldn\u2019t call it good either, but it\u2019s decent and the degree has a lot of value. Since it\u2019s a part of University of Delhi the placements are good and the lecturers are the most highly qualified people in the country, but what makes this college not so good is the crowd. The crowd of this college doesn\u2019t have a very good reputation and that obviously affects the image of the entire college. Secondly, the infrastructure is also not good either, but as compared to many other Delhi University colleges I\u2019ll say it again, that it\u2019s decent. So I would obviously not recommend anyone to go to this college over Narsee or Christ, or even Symbiosis, but it is definitely the best option in Delhi if you want to stay here. It\u2019s much better than IP university colleges or any private institution. If you\u2019re getting some better college in DU like, Bhagat Singh, CVS, Dyal Singh then go for one of them, but if the other colleges you\u2019re getting are Deshbandhu or Ramanujan or Shyamlal then go for Aurobindo.
