            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. Legally though? Not so much, unless you\u2019re prepared to wait 70 years after Rowling\u2019s death. Nevertheless, Harry Potter is a hugely popular franchise which was eventually published as an e-book, making it even easier to share it online. If buying the e-book isn\u2019t an option you\u2019re willing to consider, you can always try filetype:epub or filetype:pdf search on Google (which tends to include a handful of scamming sites) or some file sharing websites, etc. It shouldn\u2019t be much of a hassle to find, given its popularity.
