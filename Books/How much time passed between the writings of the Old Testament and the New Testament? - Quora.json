            "answer_text": "The Old Testament was written between 1500 and 400 BC (approx.) starting with Moses and the Torah, the first 5 books of the Old Testament, and ending with Malachi, who wrote during the Babylonian Captivity. It was written by the prophets and kings of Israel and gives the history of Israel and God\u2019s interactions with them, in preparation for the coming of the Messiah, the one who would redeem humanity from sin, death, and the devil. The New Testament was written between 50 and 80 AD as the Gospel was preached and the Church grew. (Jesus was crucified and rose again April 3 and 5, 33 AD, with Pentecost 50 days later.) The Gospels are eyewitness accounts of Jesus life and ministry, written by his disciples (Matthew and John) or by people who traveled with and accompanied disciples (Mark, who took dictation from Peter, and Luke, who interviewed everyone he could find. Luke also,wrote the book of \u201cThe Acts of the Apostles\u201d, which tells of the first decade or so of the early Church. Most of the rest are letters written by Apostles and first-generation leaders to various churches that they founded and led, instructing and guiding them. The last book, The Revelation to St. John, is a book of prophecy written by the Apostle. While it took some time for these letters and books to be accepted, one criteria for acceptance into the canon, which was pretty well closed by the beginning of the second century, was that they had been written by eyewitnesses to Jesus and accepted by many, if not all, existing congregations.

            "answer_text": "The later books of the Old Testament, the Deuterocanonical books, are accepted as inspired Scripture by Catholics, Orthodox and other ancient Churches. They are found in the Greek Septuagint Bible. The Deuterocanonical books date from 300\u2013150 BC. St Paul's early letters to the Thessalonians and Corinthians begin about 50 AD, so there is roughly a 200-year gap between the latest OT books and the earliest NT books. The Deuterocanonicals consist of Tobit, Judith, 1&2 Maccabees, Sirach, Wisdom, Baruch, the Letter to Jeremiah, some sections of Daniel and Esther. They were written in Greek, it was thought, but Hebrew copies of some of these texts have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. All Christians used these Deuterocanonicals until Luther threw them out in the 1520s, accepting only the Jewish canon. ",
