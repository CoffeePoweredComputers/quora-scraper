            "answer_text": "Q: Is Baha'i Faith good or bad? Basically, by their very nature, all religions are bad. The fundamental trouble with religion is that adherents are pressured believe whatever is taught in that religion. The result is that people will antagonistically divide against each other. We can see the power of religion that creates division in humanity that transcends divisions created by race, nationalism, politics, class, and even family. The irony is that on the religious plane, members will then divide themselves based on differing doctrines within the religion. Baha'i is basically an offshoot of Islam that incorporated Christianity, Buddhism, and a handful of others religions. The concept of Baha'i is unique in that it supposedly accepts the beliefs something like nine religions, and they believe all people are equal and should live in unity. Some aspects of this is beautiful, other aspects are destructive. Their idealism is beautiful, thinking we can unify under \u201ctrue\u201d Truth, and peace will result. They believe that this would lead us to a universal understanding that every human is equal and as such should be compassionately treated. The reality of the concept is ugly because people are people. It is impossible enough for a family to live in harmony with every member treated equally with compassionate love. In other words, if not even one family can achieve the ideals of Baha'i, how can humanity achieve that? To argue against myself about the impossibility of humanity uniting (through religion of all things given our history), I actually do believe in the possibility, but being achievable only under two conditions: 1) we must actually know the Truth, and 2) we must commit ourselves to living harmoniously by that Truth. Jesus even had this as His highest ideal: I pray for those who shall believe on Me, that they may all be ONE, as You, Father, are ONE in Me, and I am ONE in You, that they also may be ONE in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And I gave them the glory (Essence of God) which You gave Me, that they may be ONE, even as We are ONE, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in ONE; and that the world may know that You have sent Me and love them as You love Me. ~John 17:20-23 That being said, I can resonate with the concept of learning from all people. When I entered my spiritual Christianity (mystic as denoted by the Scriptural term \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u0301\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd muste\u0304rion used 27 times in the NT), one of the first thing I was told (by my Father) was this, referring to the matter of discerning what is Truth. I was told: Everyone has something precious and everyone has something vile. Take that which is precious and leave that which is vile. A key aspect inseparably coupled with that, I was to use the gift of discernment to identify between the precious and vile. So, the concept of Baha'i is fantastic, but their approach is deeply flawed. As a wise friend noted, if there is One God, why would He give a plethora of instructions, especially instructions that are contradictory, leaving us mere humans to sort through it all. My approach differs in that to learn, I connect directly with my Father as I walk through life, keeping an awareness that everyone I meet may have some wisdom I need. First this opens my mind to continual learning, otherwise my mind will be shut like a cell door keeping me in bondage. Second by continually practicing a spiritual gift, it enhancing my overall spiritual ability. Third, there is so much to learn not just from the Bible, but what His Spirit explains through the Rhema, spoken, Word, through my experience, and thee experience of others. Fourth, Jesus, my example, explained Truth through what He observed in our daily lives, and He used that to illustrate higher Truth. A parable is simply using life as we know it to explain something spiritual and not known by us. Words are really fuzzy as to their meaning, but an illustration from life or a God given vision or dream can speak clearly to us. Here is my point. Baha'i attempts to glean Truth of a mass of nine, I think, religions, sorting through to the best of their ability, in order to determine their truth. And at the top of their heap, Allah is God. Allah is the name of the ancient moon god known throughout that region. How do they prove all these things are true? At the top of the Judaeo-Christian understanding God calls Himself \u201cI AM\u201d. That\u2019s not even a name. Jesus repeatedly defined His being in the same manner. I AM conveys the meaning of being existent throughout all time past - present - future, throughout all space, throughout all dimensions, down to the level of existing throughout our being of hopes and dreams and agony and ecstasy. He is finite and infinite. THAT is our God. My approach to gleaning Truth is to pay attentions to His written, Rhema, and Logos Words, observe what He teaches us through divine synchronicities, the play of life, dreams, visions, through sorrows, through joy. Life is here to endlessly teach us. We are to repay Her with our divinely imparted Love freely distributed. Go to your Creator and heavenly Father and learn from Him. He gives details on how to do miracles and receive answers to prayer. Trust the God Who actually DOES something. Go to Him and ask Him to teach you and prove Himself to you directly. Father bless us by Your eternal Being. He is real: Believe in Miracles - instant weight loss ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on whom you ask this question to. I was a Baha\u2019i for more than 20 years and I can say with assurance that Baha\u2019i Faith is not good. I have reasons to claim this, you are free to independently check my claims. Following are some lesser known facts that are kept hidden from the Baha\u2019is and these same points made me resign from this \u201creligion\u201d. 1) Women are not allowed to serve the most Supreme Administrative Body, the Universal House of Justice. So there is no Equality of Men and Women. 2) Baha'is are working to establish a Baha'i inspired New World Order, a Baha'i Super-state, headquartered in Haifa, Israel. 3) Baha'is shun (ex-communicate) Covenant-Breakers and execrate them. 4) Baha'is persecute the so-called covenant-breakers, they have desecrated the grave of Diya'u'llah who was buried next to his father Baha'u'llah. 5) Baha'is have as many as 15 splinter groups, sects. 6) Baha'is have their religious text Copyrighted and religious symbols Trademarked. 7) Baha'is teach their 'faith' everywhere except in Israel for unknown reasons! 8) Baha'is lie regarding their population, they claim their population in India to be over 1.8 Million, while the government census of 2011, reveals their figure to be 4572. 9) Baha'is selectively translate their writings for western audience and there is very heavy Baha'i censorship. 10) There is no independent Baha'i Scholarship, all Baha'i texts need to be approved before publication. 11) Baha'is see all other religions as corrupted and dead. They believe that every religion has a life of 1000 years. There is nothing like \"unity of religions\" - they believe their religion is superior to all other religions. 12) Baha'is believe that Baha'u'llah is the sender of all prophets, the revealer of all holy books and Lord of the Lords! 13) Babis (predecessors of Baha'is) have killed many Muslims in Iran. Baha'is have also killed a few Azalis. 14) Baha'is believe their supreme body (The UHJ) to be infallible, they call it as 'Seat of God'! 15) Baha'i guardian Shoghi Effendi was a closeted Homosexual, he used to spend months in Switzerland with Baha'i money.
