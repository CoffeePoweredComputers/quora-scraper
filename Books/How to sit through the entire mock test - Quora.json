            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Firstly, understand that mock tests and one of the most important tools in your CAT preparation. Getting disheartened and closing the test window will not help you in any way. Try not to do that again! Mock test will help you assess: Where you standWhich are the areas you need to work onHow has the effect of your previous work on your weak areas been, Fine-tuning your test taking strategy etc. and much more.But all this will be of little use if you are not through with your basics.  Since I'm not sure about the stage of your preparation, I would consider 2 possible situations, 1. Not yet through with your basics If you started your preparation recently and are not done with your basics yet (at least 60-70% of Quant topics in my opinion), do it first  as Nikhil Kajaria said and also take a few sectional tests to get yourself acquainted. Once you start giving mocks, initially you might not be able to answer a lot of questions but right now focus should be mainly on coverage of basics and the different problem types. Meanwhile, with every mock you take resolve the entire test again without time limit. Solve questions which you couldn't, re-solve questions which you got wrong and check solutions for the ones you solved correctly to see if there is any other method to reduce the time further. 2. Done with your basics If you are done with your basics and are not able to solve a bunch of questions in the beginning, don't feel disheartened. Skip the questions and move on to the next. It might very much be the case that there are a few speed breakers or a few difficult questions right at the start. They are meant to make you feel disheartened and give up. The ones who don't fall for the trap and the ones who will do well. If I was faced with a similar situation i.e. I could not the initial few questions on a trot, I would start solving questions from the last question onwards, and once I solved a few, I would get my confidence back and after the first round (where I solved the easy questions), I would sometimes be able to solve the difficult questions also that I initially couldn't. See if this works for you. Finally, analyse the mocks well, learn from them and improve. Never leave mocks again in the middle of it! All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "One of my close friend Ashish Srivastava advised me when I was going through very tough phase 'Listen, if you think everything you have done is for nothing then do remember that Bamboos during initial period of few months grow quite slowly but once it's done with establishing its underground foundation it shoots up like a rocket rising one foot per day'Remember like a Bamboo you are in foundation-building stage and fact that the visible growth is minimal at this stage doesn't negate the fact that this is the most important stage of one's preparation.  I can understand the mental torture one bears when one is unable to attempt or solve continuously 5-6 questions in row. Everything seems dry and dull then and cracking CAT seems like a distant dream but do remember Mocks are merely Mocks that's why they are called Mocks. Take them seriously and learn from every Mock you will attempt but do remember this is merely simulation not an actual one. It's better dying hundred times in simulation rather than getting shot in the real war. Nobody told it was going to be easy. Choice is yours A) Attempt Mock dedicatedly; Unsolved questions; Leave the test; Face the CAT unprepared                                                         ORB) Attempt Mock dedicatedly; Unsolved questions; Complete the mock even if you are unable to solve even a single question; Go the basics especially in case of Quant and try to sort out reason for your performance; Repeat till actual CAT; Now Face the CAT fully preparedIf you think your basics are sound and you are prepared for CAT then leaving questions unattempted is not a failure but closing test window is ",
