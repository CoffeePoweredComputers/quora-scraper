            "answer_text": "Two things: wealth and celebrity. Schools become prestigious because wealthy and prestigious people found them. They also get wealthy and prestigious people to endorse them and then get the children of wealthy and prestigious people to become educated there. Obviously, the facilities, the gorgeous grounds and buildings, and the top tier education helps, but without people buying into the idea that the wealthy and prestigious send their kids there, other wealthy and prestigious people won\u2019t send their kids there and people won\u2019t see as a place where these people send their kids. There\u2019s also a sense where this is maintained by having good marketing, not to mention class snobbery (especially in the UK), but those are secondary. ",
