            "answer_text": "ABSOLUTELY! I mean, why would it 'NOT' be right to read from any book? Hi there! Reading from the question, seems like you're confused as to whether you should be referring to NCERT textbooks for your examinations or not. See, the answer to this question is very clear, \u201cYOU SHOULD!\u201d. I reckon that you're in CBSE because that's when one follows NCERT, take it from my experience that CBSE question pattern for boards or even in internals are solely based on NCERT textbooks. You should not even have second thoughts about NOT reading it. If you want to read other publications for any subject, feel free to do so but before that or even after, make sure that you open your NCERT textbooks and read through them. You should not ignore a single concept jotted down in your NCERT textbooks because every word of those textbooks are important. Now, I guess I've scared you enough. But take it as an advice and nothing more or less. Also, if you're looking to buy NCERT textbooks then check out the website MyPustak. You can get them for the cheapest price at that website. I hope I was able to help you out in some way. Thank you. ",
