The same is true of his *11/22/63, * though I felt the consequences of the alternate timeline were plain silly, even a copout historically. (No spoilers!) He can write a mystery series. So the answer is: yes. ",

            "answer_text": "Stephen King is 72 so it\u2019s highly likely his main audience is over 50. People grew up with his writings and the fact that he\u2019s sold over 350,000,000 books and is responsible for 84 movies must mean that he\u2019s doing something exceptional to garner such a large audience. I read him because he is an excellent writer and has a active imagination. My only complaint with his work is that IMO often the endings don\u2019t equal the beginnings and the majority of the ensuing prose. ",

He\u2019s an extraordinary and sadly underrated writer. Academia hates him. But then again, they don\u2019t have his talent. ",
