            "answer_text": "Hey, nice to meet you. My name\u2019s Jet Pack. I\u2019m basically a social caterpillar that made his wings out of duct tape, and now I pride myself with the ability to make friends with just about anyone at just about anytime. While socializing comes easily to extroverts, for introverted people, it can be more challenging. But isn\u2019t that exactly what self-proclaimed introverts enjoy? Challenges and puzzles, obstacles for them to overcome. For me, and hopefully for you, it can become a game, a sport even. While I have way too much information to put in one answer, I can give you a few of my favorite tips that I\u2019ve picked up over the years. Every single thing I suggest doing is something that I\u2019ve tested, and it has worked. Tip #1: do things to prove to yourself that you do not care about other people\u2019s opinions I used to spend a ton of time getting ready for school in the morning because I wanted to look nice for friends/random girl I had a crush on/judgy strangers in the hallways, but one day I was running late. I hurriedly yanked the first pair of pants off of the shelf, and ran to school. When I got to my first class, I saw a couple students looking at me snickering. Instantly, I attacked myself, racking my brain while trying to find the reason for their humor. Was my hair messed up? Was my shirt on backwards? \u201cHey Jet,\u201d a girl said, \u201cwhat happened to your pants?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d I panicked, and gave the first excuse that popped into my head: \u201cYeah, my little brother wore these, and he has projectile diarrhea.\u201d I\u2019ll admit, the girl was disgusted, but the rest of the class exploded in laughter. It was at that moment that I realized something: If you just act like you know what you\u2019re doing, you can do basically whatever you want and everyone will think it\u2019s cool. Of course, you won\u2019t be completely judgement free, there will always be metaphorical girls who don\u2019t appreciate poop jokes in your metaphorical classroom, but believe me, it\u2019s worth it. Since then, I\u2019ve done all kinds of things to test the limit of what society will accept. I started wearing pajamas to school, I once came to schopl with a neon green swimcap stretched over my eyebrows. And what I\u2019ve found is this: the more unnacceptable I behave, the more accepted I become Tip #2: Fake it til you make it I arrived at the party. I had had a long day, and I was exhausted, yet my heart was still racing. So many people in such a small space. I had been crying only minutes before from sheer stress overload, and this was not helping. I felt the weight of one thousand sets of eyes crush my confidence. I absolutely could not let them see me cry. Nothing makes me more annoyed than whem people pity me. So I did the only thing I thought would work: lie to everyone. Not with my words, but with my eyes. I jumped and I laughed, I did wierd stupid things with wierd stupid people, even though I felt miserable. But here\u2019s the thing, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember when exactly, but somewhere along the line, I started to actually have fun, as if I had convinced myself that I wasn\u2019t bitter. There\u2019s an entire science behind this; it\u2019s based off of a priciple called \u2018mind body feedback loops\u2019 or \u2018power poses\u2019. You can research it if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s incredibly interesting. Tip #3: EVERYONE is a five-year-old, and EVERYONE is you\u2019re long lost brother/sister \u201cOh my goodness, it\u2019s so good to finally see you again!!! How\u2019s the family?!?\u201d \u201cOh my goodness! I\u2019m so sorry, but I don\u2019t remember your name.\u201d \u201cNo worries dude, we\u2019ve never actually met, but you seem like the kind of guy I would be best friends with.\u201d You know the face a girl makes when they see a five-year-old kid approaching them? That\u2019s the kind of smile you should go for whenever you see someone you want to make a good impression on, because deep down, EVERYONE is a five-year-old kid. We all love sweets and playing pretend, except instead of imagining dragons and castles, we imagine all of the ways things can go wrong any time we open our mouths. You know the way two brothers greet each other after one spends five years touring in Iraq? That should the kind of greeting you give a friend you haven\u2019t seen in a few days. It\u2019s this kind of stuff where if you pretend it long enough, it becomes true. If you pretend that someone is your best friend, it will be true. If you pretend that you are the coolest dude to walk the planet, it will be true. If you pretend that the girl you have a crush on likes you back, it will be true. And don\u2019t give me any shinannigans about becoming ignorant in order to be social. You were going to pretend something anyways. Humans are inevitably irrational and illogical. So if we\u2019re going to convince ourselves of something, it may as well be that we can do anything we want. Which brings me to my final tip: Tip #4: introverts don\u2019t exist This was an insane realization to me. All of the time I had spent being afraid of what others would think of me, all the time I had been mean, spiteful and ignorant in a vain attempt to placate the people around me, all the time I had spent awake at night thinking about the girl I was in love with, the girl I \u2018knew\u2019 would never feel the same, all of it was me. I wasn\u2019t predestined to be am introvert. God didn\u2019t add any \u2018introvert\u2019 juice into the cauldron when he was making my personality; I did. The only reason I was scared of talking to people was because I didn\u2019t think I could change. I stayed trapped in this prison of anxiety because I thought I\u2019d be lying to myself if I acted brave when I wasn\u2019t. And every time something went wrong, every time I got laughed at, even when I got rejected by the girl, I had a crutch to lean on: It\u2019s because I\u2019m just an introvert. I can\u2019t socialize with people, it\u2019s just not who I am. Scientifically, that doesn\u2019t even make any sense. Humans have been social creatures since before they were even called humans. We have a rediculously large amount of our brain dedicated to being social, making friends, and finding love. The only thing stopping you is yourself, not some stupid latin label. If you want something you\u2019ve never had, you\u2019ll have to do something you\u2019ve never done - Anonymous ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the thing with us introverts: We value quality over quantity. Whereas I know many of my extroverted friends value both of them sort of equally, and will inevitably have more friends than me, introverts only need a few good friends we can rely on to keep us from going insane. If you are a true introvert, then you are totally complacent with alone time; in fact, we cherish it! But yes. We do need companionship too and are NOT hermits, despite what others may think. Here are some tips that I used to get quality friends in high school: When you meet someone you think is a quality person and can be a long-time friend, TELL THEMLiterally the first day of school, in grade 8, I met my best friend. I knew he was a quality person and someone that would be compatible with me. In grade 12, for my birthday, he wrote me a letter to tell me he still remembered what I told him 5 years ago when we met. This is verbatim: \u201cI think we will be good friends in the future\u201dThis goes with even people you don\u2019t necessarily KNOW, but you FEEL like they are potentially a great person. (You know this because you are a wallflower and have been observing). Use your courage and approach this person and tell them you think they are cool and would love to be their friend. This is EXACTLY how I met my best friend. (Look above)Conversely, if you meet someone who you feel is not compatible with you, and dare I say, someone who is not a quality person, then don\u2019t bother with themIt takes a lot of effort for us introverts to socialize\u2026and we get drained very quickly in these interactionsDon\u2019t bother yourself with people you KNOW won\u2019t be long-lasting friends.With the close friends you do have, please put in some effortI know you don\u2019t want to go to parties. But if it\u2019s a party your friend is throwing, please, please, just show up and offer your time and presence. These little things do add up and your friends will notice, especially if they know you don\u2019t necessarily enjoy partying.Find other introvertsThis is the perfect scenario, because you will have a mutual understanding that even if neither of you contacts each other for days/weeks, you understand that it\u2019s just the introversion acting up. And when you guys do meet up and hang out, the time will be more precious and valuable.Good Luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "By staying true to who you are and not feeling like you have to make friends the extroverted way.  Some essentials: Learn to embrace your introversion: The first step to connecting with others is to reconnect with your authentic introverted self. That means being proud of your introversion and comfortable in your way of being. When you do this, you\u2019ll be amazing at how many doors open for you from the world and the people around you.Enjoy your alone time: It\u2019s a tricky balance of making sure we have enough blissful solitude and are giving up a portion in order to be with another. It\u2019s important to decide who is worthy to know our truths. Who will honour the privilege of being accepted into our inner world? Who will treat our thoughts, ideas, and dreams with the respect they deserve? And how can we find them without too much small talk?!Find the right people: It begins with a straightforward question to yourself: What do you actually want to find? Once you get clear on what you want from a friendship and why, you become like a lighthouse to all the friend gems that would have otherwise passed you by. You also begin to notice the right people, and welcome them into your world. (The same principle applies to anything you want in life.) To find the right people you have to be the right person.Energise before you socialise: Meeting new people is best done on a full energy tank. True connection is difficult to cultivate when you feel like you\u2019re about to self-destruct. Know your limits. For some introverts, thirty minutes of meet and greet is fine. For others, ten minutes is too much.Replenish your energy regularly: Understand your energy needs and learn how to honour them without guilt. Sometimes this means saying \u2018no\u2019 to certain social activities, so that you can say \u2018yes\u2019 to sacred self-care. Sometimes this means getting over the \u201csocial hangover\u201d the day after an event by stay in your pyjamas for the next day (or three).Deepen connections the introverted way: Being real, authentic, honest, and truthful is an attractive quality. It draws people in quickly and makes them instantly let their guard down. You remind them that you\u2019re both on the same team here, wanting the same things. One honest admonition can nip small talk in the bud.",

            "answer_text": "If you're a painfully shy introvert like me, it can be very hard to make friends. I find new people utterly terrifying, and will often do anything to keep my discomfort to a minimum; by hiding and only having brief conversations. The friends I do have often ask me \u201chow the hell do you have any friends? XD\u201d. I then point out, \u201cwell your my friend ask yourself!\u201d. To be honest then, the friends I have made, are often forced by circumstance. Where I'd be forced to spend extended periods of contact with them. Often wishing to begin with, that they would just go the hell away. But if they're nice people I'll eventually warmup to them, and my tolerance for them grows. I get less and less drained around them. Then I start to enjoy or look forward to there company. At this point I try to actively be there friend. Asking how they're doing, what they're up to. And getting into weirder, more random or deeper conversations. At this point I'm generally also more comfortable with banter and friendly insults. From there I get to meet friend of a friends, with a similar, if just quicker process. As they are affiliated with someone I already like. All in all, I say I've been quite lucky in my social life thus far. I've had people that have initially stuck with me. Through all my discomfort and trying to run away. So I guess the moral of the story is this. Making friends is different for everyone. Some people are the fetchers that go out and pursue friends, and some are passive; where they have a few people that stick to them, long enough to be their friend. And it's OK if you find it hard to actively go out there and make friends, just be in a situation where people could want to stick around and be friends with you. Even you initially don't want them or feel uncomfortable. Good luck! ",

This self-disclosure fosters a closeness between two people that develops understanding and meaning, two of the key ingredients for friendship.  But, how do we convince people to open up? Checkout some of psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron's 36 questions (listed below) aimed at revealing interpersonal closeness. The next time you're out, challenge yourself to get outside of your comfort zone and ask someone a question from this list. You'll be surprised how receptive people are when you come across as genuinely curious and interested in their answer. After they answer, share your response. You don't have to make it through all 36 questions, but this act is a great gateway to reveal and extend windows of opportunity for friendship.

Which I at first do not want to come along to. But I end up saying \u201calright, I will come along.\u201dIt usually takes a while for me to warm up so to speak. Meaning I like to observe for a while before bumping into people here and there at for instance a party. I might be outside giving myself some space when another person shows up right by. I might end up talking about needing some space and that it is nice outside. We might stand there for a while having a pleasant conversation. It is nice to meet people one-on-one. It is easier to handle conversations that way, but from a conversation to a friendship well\u2026.. It depends on what happens in various conversations. One conversation we might talk about this new cool mini golf place, and at the end of the conversation we might agree on trying it out together. We give each other our own telephone numbers and agree to mini golf on Saturday at 3pm. He/She or I will pick up the other person and drive to the place. If you ask me this question. If you had something you very much wanted to share do you have a friend to share it with? I can really not say yes to that question. I could of course talk with my room mate, but a close and loving friend who listens with an open mind who is not my room mate\u2026..well I would have to take a pass on that. I am an introvert even more so during this Corona period. I work a lot on the computer with WordPress. I have many digital \u201cfriends\u201d but they are not in a sense real friends. Making friends is being willing to go places where there are people and being open and willing to have random conversations. Figure out interests and attend meetings that focus on an interest. Bottom line just go places where likeminded people are doing something you also like. There should be a club for introverted people. ",

Hanging out with people is a great way to make friends. Let\u2019s take a look at what introverts are. in\u00b7tro\u00b7vert noun: introvert A shy, reticent person. A person predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things.No, that just won\u2019t do. Let\u2019s see what Urban Dictionary says. \u201cIntrovert Opposite of extrovert. A person who is energized by spending time alone. Often found in their homes, libraries, quiet parks that not many people know about, or other secluded places, introverts like to think and be alone. Contrary to popular belief, not all introverts are shy. Some may have great social lives and love talking to their friends but just need some time to be alone to \"recharge\" afterwards. The word \"Introvert\" has negative connotations that need to be destroyed. Introverts are simply misunderstood because the majority of the population consists of extroverts.\u201d Hmm. Not all introverts are shy? A person who is energized by being alone and drained quickly from social activities. So, to make friends.. Less people the better. Groups up to eight seem to be best. That way you don\u2019t get overwhelmed.Don\u2019t talk about yourself if you don\u2019t have to. People are self-centered anyway, so if you ask them questions about their life and avoid answering any yourself, you\u2019ll be a-ok.Be patient. People don\u2019t emotionally connect until you open up to them. People forget easily. They have lives to live. Wait until they can spend quality time and really bond with you.Avoid hanging out too much. Don\u2019t drain yourself too much. Take some breaks.",

Anyone who thinks there is an easy answer to help shy or introverted people make friends is obviously delusional. I've been dealing with this for over 30 years (thanks to parents who uprooted me every other year from school to school). The best way to meet people seems to go somewhere that there are lots of people, but that leads to the phenomenon of finding only previously-established tight-knit cliques who have no interest in finding new people to join them. Over the years, I've forced myself out of my \"comfort zone\" time and time again, with very little luck. When I've connected with people, it's been random, lending support to the theory that you meet the person you're supposed to when you're not looking. But how is that helpful? I can tell you that the only thing I haven't given up on is meetup dot com.  It certainly isn't the magical answer I thought it would be when I heard about it a year ago, but I've done interesting things and met interesting people. I'm still hoping the right group will come along. I think the great thing about the concept is that it's not just about meeting people who enjoy certain activities (like rock climbing), but there are plenty of groups built around meeting people who share similar views, beliefs, ideals, and tastes. Have you tried craigslist? There are interesting nooks and crannies there that some people don't seem to know about: \"strictly platonic\" under the  personals section; the community section has stuff like \"activities\", \"classes\", \"events\", \"groups\", etc; then there are the discussion forums (online forums can be a great way to meet like-minded people, so joining one that's only for your area could increase your chance of developing a bond with someone online that you could actually meet in person!). If it means anything, I think you've got a leg up on most people in our shoes because you're getting out there and you also seem to know what it is about you that makes you \"different\". Try to keep in mind that there have got to be other \"George Carlin types\" who enjoy rock climbing, right? On a personal note, I'm really curious why you describe yourself as an \"introvert\" in your question but in the description you call yourself a \"George Carlin type\", because I never really got the impression that the guy was introverted!  I think I might be in your shoes though: I'm beyond pessimistic, I swear too much, I am suspicious/unimpressed with religion and dominant cultural norms, etc. Maybe there is a George Carlin fanclub for people like us?

            "answer_text": "Introverts have a tendency to be within themselves which might appear as rude to a lot of people. When I was a kid I used to hide inside my room whenever some guests used to visit our house. I was afraid of saying \"Namaste\" to the guests so I used to disappear into my room. I used to spend lot of time playing with my friends but I also used to spend a lot of time talking in front of the mirror with myself. As kids we generally don't have problems in making new friends or playing with friends but as we age we like to be with like minded people. As an introvert what I have realized is that I maybe slow in making new friends but I'm steady with most of my old friends. I have come to realize that most people who are looking for superficial friendships might not like you but people who are actually looking for a deep friendship respond to you well if you treat them the way you treat yourself. As an Introvert you are your best friend, so treat your friends as you will treat yourself, talk to them as if you talk to yourself (like you do in front of a mirror) and the right friends will respond and stay. Friendship is rooted in sacrifice, a friend in need is a friend indeed. If you are true to your friendship when a friend is in need, then you will keep your friends and make new ones too. ",

This is a person who tends to see social overtures from others as intrusions. A lot of times, people who are socially clumsy sort of pretend to be introverted because they find it a more attractive label. If you wish you had friends and you don\u2019t and you\u2019re lonely, that\u2019s not introversion. It\u2019s social clumsiness. That\u2019s good news, though. Being introverted is a pretty ingrained thing. Being socially clumsy is something that you can address. First, get in shape as much as you can. Then dress well and appropriately. Get clues from what others do. When you see something you admire, try to copy it and incorporate this trait or action into your life. If you feel uncomfortable talking to others, keep it light and don\u2019t talk a lot. If you are considering approaching others, it\u2019s good to approach others who aren\u2019t the life of the party types. Those might be people who turn out to be in a bad mood or who are actual introverts and see your approach as an invasion of sorts. No harm, no foul if that happens. Hang around a few moments and go on to someone else who tends to be at the edges of a gathering. You can do this. ",

I'm an introvert who has easily moved in excess of 50 times in my 43 years, so learning to make friends has come with practice. I'm quite happily a loner, so making friends hasn't always been high on my list of priorities, but things I have done in the past are:  Try something new on a regular basis (cheesemaking, archery, ice-skating, toastmasters group, whatever) and make the effort to talk to people. If nothing else, you'll expand your life experience and become more interesting because of it.Make the effort to get to know your neighbours. The last town I lived in I made very good friends with 3 sets of neighbours. This weekend I met 2 sets of new neighbours and will be inviting them for a make-your-own-pizza night in the next week.Invite people to a casual gathering (jazz in the park, horse races, local festivals, etc.. whatever works) so there's no pressure to arrange anything yourself (and often you can have a lovely time, even if you're by yourself). Organise a regular (say once a month, or bi-monthly) restaurant meal and invite friends you do have to invite someone new. Organise your own local interest group via social media and arrange a catch-up on a regular basis eg. a thinker's club, book club, car enthusiast club, Scrabble club.. whatever floats your boat.And remember - even if other people have different world-views to you, that doesn't mean you can't be friends. It means you get the opportunity to explore other views and maybe open yourself to new perspectives (or provide that opportunity for others). After all, living in an echo chamber gets pretty boring after a while. ",

Most extrovert people become friends with light useless conversations and they wear social mask for long time Introvert people hate social mask, talk deeper ( show me your true personality) and useful conversations or shut your mouth. Many people attend to describe introvert as shy people, but the truth is not all of them are shy, they just think your topic is stupid and don't want to talk. ( I mean like, seriously, I don't care what did you do when you were drunk last week, why telling me how stupid you were). Extrovert people tend to take deep conversations later after long friendship because they take time to build the bridge of trust on for deep conversations, or removing social mask too. So in summary : If you are extrovert and wanting to be friend with introvert : stop talking shit and playing around and they become your friend. If you are introvert and wanting to make friends with extrovert: you have to wear social mask and act a bit stupid so extrovert people will attend to think they are smarter and start getting close to you as your mentor or perhaps manipulate you. So don't put your defenses down. , ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing you need to do is become less introverted. It's very hard making friends when you can't speak to strangers and therefore you need to start talking to new people. If you have already have some friends take them with you and ask them to say hello to that person you want to talk to. When the friend says hi, say hi you too. The person will most likely reply to you and then you have talked to a new person. If your friend is social, ask them to start a conversation with the person and then you can be in the conversation without saying much but if you feel comfortable say something to the person. It will be much easier when you have a friend with you. Now when you have spoken to someone it will probably feel easier talking to the person again. If you don't have friends or you want to make friends at work/school where you don't have friends then an idea can be to ask someone a question about something related to work/school. I know it's hard but think through what you're going to say and go up to the person and speak as naturally as you can. When you have talked to someone it will be easier talking to that person again. Another thing you can try is to (if you have the money and time) start going to some kind of course or \u201cconvention\u201d of something that you're interested in. There will probably be people similar to you there and there will most likely be social people there that might can talk to you. Go to the group and just say hello. Someone will most likely reply to you and then you only have to listen to the conversation between some other people. The good thing about extroverts is that many of them loves talking to new people so they will appreciate you. Just listen and ask questions where it fits if you feel like it. And remember to go slow. You can't change this in one day, it will months or maybe years getting new friends but remember that a lot of people will just be happy taking to you. And if someone seems cold/uninterested they might be an introvert who feels awkward talking to new people aswell so don't be too sad if you feel rejected. Now these are only tips I feel will work for me, I can't guarantee they will work for you. But I'm very introvert myself and I have a hard time getting new friends aswell so I know what it feels like. Sorry if my English is hard to understand. ",

            "answer_text": "You are in good company as an introvert. At least 1/3 to 1/2 of the population falls into that category. My partner and one of my kids are introverts also. Both graduated HS, College, found a life mate and hold good careers. They also like things that are more solitary pursuits: reading, chess, swimming, skiing, roller skating, surfing, etc. my daughter took violin lessons (private) for 12 plus years. At about age 12, she joined a youth orchestra. She continued for about five or six years. It was an opportunity to be a member of a bigger group but all the prep and performance was individually focused on ones own part.You express interests in rock climbing, hiking, reading, etcetera. I recommend uou join a conservation or land trust group. Those individuals spend a lot of time walking, hiking, enjoying nature. Maybe join a gym that has rock wall climbing. You will probably meet others who share that passion and may enjoy some outdoor adventures like rock or mountain climbing. Book groups are another great way to enjoy your interest in reading but being more in a group setting. If you read a book your passionate about, it's great to share thoughts but book groups tend to let their members participate or listen according up their inclination.I think that once you shed the idea that introverted means alone, you will find pathways to connections. There are connections for everyone once they figure out what they like and want, it is possible to increase the social net. You may never have hoards of followers and friends but, most people don't want that in reality. ",

Making friends is nothing difficult in today's world as you have Facebook, Instagram and so on. There you can have 100\u2019s of friends. But to be frank nobody really cares. I am being harsh on answering this is because even i am an Introvert. Normally we be like try spending time with people but as the time goes on we miss ourselves and brain starts storming to have peace. So i request rather than finding friends, find people of same interests around you. That helps you to find a company, where you don't feel like being strange. Find what you're interested in, identify a place where you can find people of your interests and start communicating with them. This really gives you confidence and you in maintaining a company. Rather than having 100 fake people around you. As of me Introverts are none, they are same like other. The only difference is they stay away from unwanted things or things which they are not interested. Once they find the people of their interests then you can really say how good he is in communicating with people. Be glad you are introvert, so that you doesn't show-off with the fake stuff. Just find your interest and go through it. You can make wonders. ",

            "answer_text": "Did you mean that how can we make friends all by our-self, even though we are introverts by nature? It is easy. First, this question shows that you understand your nature and you are inquiring which is a sign of curiosity. This curiosity will help you to uncover the mystery of simple communication. Let me tell you, there\u2019s no mystery, communication is just the message exchange between two people. You communicate with the other person, and ask him or her to become your friend. Second, I would suggest that you shouldn\u2019t think of yourself as introvert or give up the idea that only outgoing people can make friends. Read about J.K Rowling (Harry Potter Author), Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, Christina Aguilera, Eleanor Roosevelt, Emma Watson, Albert Einstein if you want to know how they overcame their introvert natures & rose up to the greatest heights in their respective careers. Read about Eminem, Shakira (if you want to learn about failures and how to get back up). You can definitely make friends with people you want, the only way which works with 99% of other people i.e by effective communication and an attitude to learn about them. You need to understand where they are coming from, what they want in life, why you want to become friends with them and then approach them. Sometimes, a friendship is plain and simple. No strategy or mapping required to become a friend. Also, work to build your self-esteem so that you would be well-equipped in handling questions they might throw your way. Watch good films of Hollywood, Bollywood - whatever feels good. You will get more idea of befriending people. ",

Not liking to spend time with \"people\"? Which people? I don't like to spend time with religious, political and fiscal conservatives because I find them complete boors and quite unintelligent I suspect you have a particular set of ideas/thought processes/passions/professional skills/religious-spiritual philosophies that are not quite mainstream and that you find yourself in an area that has few places that would attract a crowd that would either share or welcome a free exchange of ideas.  An example would be a Southern Baptist town accepting me. I am an ordained Ruling Elder within the Presbyterian Church (USA). I strongly support marriage equality, a progressive Christian view. To me, the tenets of the Jesus Seminar are correct (There is historical reason to believe Jesus existed, he practiced faith healing of psychosomatic afflictions, he was executed for being a radical and a nuisance, the empty tomb is a hoax, etc.) Finally, the Bible is totally man-written, has had many edits and insertions (the woman being stoned story was inserted in the 600s and of the Pauline gospels, Paul for sure only wrote about 7) and is most definitely NOT the inerrant Word of God, thus should be read as history and metaphor. Conservative Christians just HATE ME (but then, they HATE instead of LOVE in any event...) My guess your story parallels this in some way. Baptists bore me to tears. I would suspect a similar group bores you as well.  Maybe it would be RedHat Linux sysadmins while you are a Centos guy/gal. Maybe it is you are a Sufi in a Shi'ite community. You don't give us a lot of information... However, you do use the Internet and you are reaching out. So..two thoughts... First--Join Linkedin. While it is the largest professional network going (much larger than Google+) there are about 1.5 million groups that have formed. Not all are professionally oriented. Some are affinity groups. I started one for folks who love and USE fountain pens. I belong to groups who love dachshunds and who love Kindle Fires. I am looking for a group dedicated to the Microsoft SurfacePro 3. Will be willing to bet there is more than one group there which you will find interesting. Second-Google search for MEET-UP groups in your area and see if there is one that meets you needs. If not..START ONE...like as not there is at least one other person who has your interest affinity that is in the same situation as you.   Sure can't hurt... Best of luck... ",

I am empowered by being in a group of people however, because my personality is so powerful, when I\u2019m having what I think is an intellectual debate, the other parties tend to feel like they Have done 10 rounds with Tyson. My point is, being an extrovert doesn\u2019t mean someone makes friends easily and being an introvert just means that when you have friends, you also need to remember to spend some time alone to recharge.

To me, I either have really good friends, or I have acquaintances; there is no in-between. Step 1: What is your expectation/ definition of a friend? As of today I have a total of 3 friends, I rarely see/speak with the other two, but I see the other fairly frequently. There are no expectations in our friendships, I've known them for years and we just click. We message each other out of the blue; no need for the \"Hey, how's it going? Been a while\" nonsense.  Personally, I seem to make friends at my place of work, as it is a lot more convenient to connect with someone when you see them almost every day. However, unlike the aforementioned friendships, these are the types of friendships I'm not sure would survive if one of us changed jobs. However, I don't think much about it , I live in the moment and I value our friendship for what it is.  My word of advice is don't have any expectations; it most likely will lead to disappointment, simply go with the flow, be friendly and open-minded. Not everyone you meet is cut out for the role you are trying to fill, sometimes all they will ever be is a rock-climbing buddy, but wouldn't you say there's still some value in that? ",

            "answer_text": "Everybody likes to answer questions about their opinions. So, think of some subjects that you are interested in, such as; fashion and clothes, a certain period of history, stars who are popular at any given time, movies that you have watched and liked or disliked, your favourite TV shows, a hobby that you have, etc. Now memorize these interests from 1 to 5 or whatever. When you find yourself in a one on one situation with another person and you have no idea what to say, start with #1 and ask the person, \u201cwhat are your favourite type of clothes (or fashions)?\u201d. They will respond with some sort of answer. If you also like something that they mention, then great, you have something in common! Next, tell them what you like fashion-wise, and ask their opinion on what you have just said. Keep on until you sense that the other person has nothing much more to say. Now move onto #2 and repeat by asking them their opinion on the historical period that interests you. Continue on with this routine until you reach the end of your list of prepared questions/subjects, remembering to always start by asking them what they think about the subject first. Another way to find favour in the eyes of a person is to often mention their name. So, when you ask them what they think about subject #1, try to phrase the question like this, \u201cJim/Jane, what do you think about such and such?\u201d Don\u2019t overdo it, but sprinkle in their name every now and then throughout the conversation. Even if you are giving your opinion on a particular subject, always remember that you are seeking to find out what they think about what you are saying? Never argue with them - if they disagree somewhat, then tell them, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting way to look at it, and \u201cI never thought of it that way\u201d. After practicing a few times with different individuals, you\u2019ll find that this method of seeking another\u2019s opinion first starts to come naturally to you and you\u2019ll be much more relaxed when talking to others. One more thing to remember; always be polite by including \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d whenever you are asking others to do something for you, such as in a store. Most people wear name tags - always use them! \u201cHi, Jim/Jane, would you be so kind as to tell me where I can find such and such?\u201d Wishing you the best on this - I was an introvert, but I became the opposite through using this method.

On many instances people say why I m being so quiet for which I couldn't answer anything. I feel that it's because of the lack of confidence in me, one on one I can talk to few people but in a group I can't talk. People think I m boring, they think I have no knowledge about anything and they always make fun of me to which I have to silently listen. In this situation people think I m not a person to be friendly I noticed that every person wants something from the other person and that's why there are relationship, like a friend need some emotional support from another friend so they get along with each other. If they think that you are of no use to them they will never even approach you. They will be respectful only if they think that you are of any help to them or in the future. Being an introvert others think that you are of no use to them and the chances of you being their friends are minimal. Noticing the people around, a person will help someone only if they like you, else they wouldn't think of helping you, so why would someone be friends with you if you are of no use to them.

Those close to you know that occasionally you need to 'hibernate'  and they will usually let you be. Don't set out to change yourself.  You were born this way and the only way you'll ever be happy is when you are yourself.  To be yourself, you need to know yourself by identifying your strengths and your weaknesses. Do not be discouraged by your weaknesses, knowing and accepting them is the first step of getting out of your 'uncomfortable' comfort zone. There are many ways to enhance your personality, to name a few:- -  Find a weekend activity to ensure that you leave your house to socialise      some weekends   -  people tend to respond positively to compliments.  You can compliment on anything, shoes, dress, hairstyle, etc., that could even lead to a longer conversation. -  people love to talk about themselves. Take a person from a different culture to yours for instance.   'A simple 'where are you from?'  is enough to start a conversation. -  teach yourself to listen with interest when in conversation with people. -  invite them for coffee, for a walk; they maybe also be seeking to make friends -  in a group situation, be confident and don't  be afraid to put your point across.  Take subtle deep breaths if you must but put your opinion across. Its OK to be cautious about people because this ensures that you surround yourself with people that matter to you.   Good luck. ",

The best way to start is hello and greeting your neighbor's in passing at home, school or work. Ask them about their day! Most people love to talk about themselves. You will find this is awkward at first, but as with anything else, the more practice you have with \u201cputting yourself out there\u201d, you will feel less awkward about it.

Practice smiling. Especially whenever you\u2019ve just made eye contact.Practice raising your hand. Just like when you do a hand wave.Stay cool. You don\u2019t have to immediately reply to anything. So always stay relaxed. Be neutral.You don\u2019t always have to show your true self to other people.Do sports. Exercise. Work out. This will really help a lot.Develop an interest to other people. Pay attention to them. Try to figure out what are the things they know that you don\u2019t.Don\u2019t believe in everything you see.Good luck. ",

I would rather be upset with myself that to lose a friend tbat I actually enjoy spending time with. Alot of times the friendships seem one sided as to me being the only that usually has to initiate a hang out. I love hani g out with people that appreciate the time spent with me. I have been lucky to almost always have 1\u20132 friends at a time ir that one loud crazy friend that doesnt mind me bejng quiet because they are able to drink when out with me and love that Indont mind them being crazy. I enjoy poling fun at them the next day about soemthing they did the night prior and I am socially smart enough to know when a friend tbats me joking is not in mean soirits and necause i love them. They can joke back to me about making a fool of my self when trying to break out of my shell and make conversation with a member of the public. I kmow when something is just not nice and know before hand not to do it. It takes me a while to get comfortable with new friends and when they stick with me I feel very privileged. Right now for the first time in a while ive been kind of lost as to finding 1\u20132 friends that are my new as for a loss for a word homely feeling or make me feel comfortable being myself. Ive kind of come to the point that id rather stay home and hang out with my parents or spend time with my nieces and I am enjoying that at this moment. The am always in need of a new friend but even when I do go out even though I am an introvert I still manage to talk although minimally and even meet a new social media friend mostly because we live in different cities and these days people dont exchange numbers anymore only their @\u2018s. In the past it was more of meeting people on social media first(2006\u20132012ish) and then maybe eventually meeting in person and some to this day i have yet met because they live on opposite sides of the US, but now wayyy less of tbat and merting in person but keeping up and getting to know them more because you can somewhat keep up with their day to day activities.

So if you want to talk to people then just ask about them, what their interests are and if you're able to engage them in their own things, you'll see that they probably won't shut up for hours. You have to adjust youself depending upon the person you're talking to, if he's intrested in sports talk to him about that, tell him a few things he didn't know about it. If they're intrested in watching TV series then suggest them some different intresting series. And that's how my friend you can become the coolest guy in the town. :D ",

Make a list of questions appropriate for the group and keep them in a 3x5 card in your pocket in case you need them.Go to social events and make sure your body language is inviting and not closed. That means don\u2019t stand in the corner by your self. Introduce yourself and join in.Find something with which you can compliment a person or ask a question of someone you really want an answer to\u2026such as \u201cDo you know of other groups like this and how did you go about finding them?Ask open ended questions rather than questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. If you hear something interesting ask the person to, \u201cSay more about that.\u201d Ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite thing to do on the weekends\u201dMost of all have fun. No matter what happens you may need a few trial runs that are not altogether successful before you feel totally comfortable. Don\u2019t make yourself wrong for this. This is a learning process so give yourself lots of support and time to get it right. If you do know of someone who has these skills and who already likes you, ask them to be a running buddy on your first excursions out.Hope this helps!",

            "answer_text": "Literally they don't. But may be we are not that hard. May be we could get one. Being an introvert my feelings or thoughts go this way~~  Don't thrive for friendship. We are born this way. There's no need to make this as an inferior complexity. Introverts are not alien. They have just their own comfort zone,own perspectives. We all people have. Difference is some people can express it,some can't. But so what?? Exactly so what?? I guess nothing. If I can deal with my feelings or thoughts to be unexpressed let it be. But we introverts also live in a society. We need to communicate too. And we do. I guess being introvert doesn't make us less communicable. Not necessarily you need to make friends with each and everyone you communicate. People come and go. Some will remain in our life. And they will be worthy of it if they understand you properly. Extroverts people may have so many friends but really are every friends worthy?? Introvert people are so hard to get a friend but when they have one trust me it's unbreakable. I have so many people in my life but they are just people. Good friends are very few ,may be 2 or 3 but they are true. So my point is if anyone values you,gets your inner side properly he/she will be your friend only,otherwise not. This goes for all extrovert and introvert people I guess!! ",

People who respect youPeople who \"get\" you and appreciate who you arePeople who encourage you to be as awesome as you can bePeople who honor the differences between youTo make a friend, be a friend. Step outside your thoughts and notice the people around you. What are they doing? What are they saying? When you like what you notice, give the gift of sincere interest. Be willing to make some mistakes. Give what you hope to receive.  As an introverted person, myself, I find that my chosen friends are a very few, but our friendships are deep and our engagements substantive. Having an army of friends would drive me underground. Literally. So, before all else, know and honor who you are and what you need. Find opportunities to make a friend every where.  And, remember: give what you desire. ",

Someone asked him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you get discouraged after failing all those times?\u2026 to which he said, \u201cNo, I felt I had discovered 999 ways how not make a light bulb\u2026\u201d In effect, what I\u2019m getting at is don\u2019t be afraid to try to make friends. If you \u201cdiscover\u201d a number of ways of \u201chow not to make friends\u201d then you\u2019ll know you\u2019re closer to finding ways to make friends. The closer you get to succeeding, the more accomplished and relaxed you will become in making friends\u2026 and your anxiety should lessen each time. Give it a try\u2026 and don\u2019t give up too easily. ",

Introverts are often considered to be quiet, but that\u2019s not because they don\u2019t like people. they just don\u2019t want to talk about \u201cpetty\u201d issues. Introverts see no point in proving themselves to others.BUT, if introverts stop doing the OVERTHINKING they might grab every opportunity & excel in whatever way/field they want. The trick is to be open-minded, understanding, and talkative.Be confident. Be honest, but do so gently. Listen. Ask questions. Use their name. Know your audience. Recognize reciprocation. Make them laugh. Soon enough, you'll have so many invitations, you'll need a bigger calendar. Give Yourself Time To Grow Because Rushing Into Things Will Spoil The Excitement Of Life. Cheers..!! ",

However, we must note 1 thing here is that some people might take advantage of you, people can take you for granted(i have experienced it). They don\u2019t care what we are all about, whereas we care about them. As introverts have less friends, if he/she tries to make friends chances are that this introverted person might not be asked anything at all. Others would get bored, same this person would get bored. Myself as an introverted person, have less friends very less male friends but very close, female friends are negligible. I would strongly recommend not to make friends, although theirs nothing wrong in it. Just i am worrying how people would perceive you. They have different thinking as compared to us. From my experience out of 10 only 1 will accept you and rest 9 would take you for granted. I am too reserved in making friends, i don\u2019t let people interfere in my life easily. I am too considerate while deciding whom to make friends whom not to, very picky i am on this, but i do not take them for granted. Lastly rejoice. ",

            "answer_text": "Be Interested: Find What Interests Them (The World\u2019s Most Successful Gold Digger) Wendi Deng has been reported by media to be history\u2019s most successful gold digger. She was born from humble beginnings in China. In college, she met an American businessman and his wife, who taught her English and sponsored her student visa to move to the U.S. to study at California State. Wendi had an affair with the businessman, 30 years his senior, and got him to divorce his wife and marry her, obtaining a green card. The relationship lasted 4 or 5 months. Through a finance and corporate development manager of Fox TV, she entered and climbed the ladder of a big Chinese TV company, Star TV. Wendi was the only Chinese executive of Star TV and that is where she met Rupert Murdoch, a media titan with a current net worth of $13.3 billion. They married 2 years later on his yacht, shortly after Rupert divorced his last wife. People tend to demonize others, so maybe Wendi didn\u2019t do all this intentionally with a motive to get more money. But maybe she did. Natural selection has been favoring males who have more resources and status since the dawn of time. What interests me is what made Wendi so magnetic and charismatic? One thing people said was that Wendi was able to make almost anyone she met enthralled with her. She was able to make people like her immediately. And that was because she was interested in others. People liked to talk about themselves and what they do for fun rather than anyone else \u2014 we\u2019re egotistical. When I heard this, I didn\u2019t quite buy it. My first reaction was \u201cWell, maybe she\u2019s just very pretty. Plus, why learn from someone like this when I can learn from people who used their powers for good?\u201d But was is good and bad? The world isn\u2019t so black and white. Is it really wrong to use your powers for just money if that\u2019s what you want? Also, I looked her up on Google and she isn\u2019t that attractive. She\u2019s not bad looking but there are plenty of girls who are prettier. Maybe she did have incredible social skills. Figure out what really lights them up and what they are really interested in. Then let them talk. And listen. If you hit a real winner, they could talk for hours on the topic. In the real world, I have tried this and it works. However, it must be done right so you don\u2019t become an annoying interviewer asking 10 questions in a row. See How To Keep A Conversation Going on that point. Also, you must learn to be genuinely interested in new topics or areas you\u2019ve never heard of. Over the years, I have learned to be more open to new topics and have learned how amazing they can truly be. Adding humor helps. Talk about that person\u2019s interests. When being interested and agreeable doesn\u2019t work\u2026 Finding out what interests others is a core strategy in Dale Carnegie\u2019s book. But what if it doesn\u2019t work? People who read the book left reviews expressing their discontent with just being interested in others. They found themselves listening to someone talk about a topic they didn\u2019t care about for up to an hour. They felt unhappy with pretending to be someone they are not and being so agreeable that they attract friends that exploit them or have glaring issues. These are red flags that you have gone too far in the other direction and the key is to pull back and have some standards and be a little more honest with how you really feel. There is a healthy middle ground between being the stingy person who isn\u2019t open-minded in the slightest and pretending to be someone you\u2019re not by faking interest in hobbies you don\u2019t give a crap about (classic \u201cNice Guy\u201d move that rarely works). The truth lies somewhere in between. Dial it back a bit. Hold your ground with some of your interests and what bores you. Be honest and change the topic of conversation occasionally. Sure, you may repel some people by being honest about what doesn\u2019t interest you. But you attract more of the people who get you. There are billions of people in the world. You\u2019ll find someone. Don\u2019t fall into a scarcity mindset here. I think many people, myself included, have feared missing out on a friend because they don\u2019t have any and they\u2019re clawing at anything they can get, even if what they can get is bad for them. By doing so, you lie about who we are and attract people who you will only feel lukewarm with. Don\u2019t do this. What if someone\u2019s boring and you don\u2019t think you can find something interesting about them? Tucker Max, a successful entrepreneur, gave me a great tip in his podcast The Mating Grounds: No matter how boring someone is, there\u2019s at least one interesting fact about them. Your first job is to find that out. This really helped me because it\u2019s really opened me up to learning interesting things about people I overlooked and really being less bored of people. I\u2019ve found that a lot of top talk show hosts are always genuinely interested in everyone\u2019s story no matter who they are. Be Willing to Get Rejected. Realize You Can Only Do So Much. Throughout my life, I have met people who just seemed to be holding back when I tried to be friendly. On a subtle level, they seemed to not show the enthusiasm and openness they do to other friends I see them with. There was another person who was Indian, my age, and my neighbor. But every time I spoke, the response was always quick, cordial, and distant. This is fine. Not everyone is going to click with you. I remember a group of Korean Americans in school that hung with 99% other Korean Americans. I tried my best to enthusiastically get involved but it always seemed like I was treated as an acquaintance. They never talked to me first and if they did, it was quick and more formal. I may never know if it was because I was Chinese American. If so, that\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all humans at the end of the day. Plus, I was Asian, just like them. But realize this: it\u2019s a two-way street. You can\u2019t control everything. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in believing that you have full control over who can be your friend from all the self-help advice out there. But the truth is, just like dating, both parties have to choose to be involved. There could be hundreds of different reasons outside of your control that aren\u2019t your fault as to why someone doesn\u2019t want to be your friend. Come to terms with this. Be fine with it. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. As long as I realize that I have done my part fully to show that I want to be friends (in a warm, enthusiastic, polite, non-creep way), the rest is up to the other person. What I can\u2019t allow is for me to screw up on what I can control, such as being too shy to make friends. It still stings for me when others don\u2019t want to be friends but don\u2019t take it too personally. Sometimes, you don\u2019t really have that much in common anyways and you\u2019re just trying to make friends to satisfy ego. Balance Rather than Extremism One key issue brought up constantly is that a good portion of the book is not on actually making friends. It\u2019s on getting people to like you, even if it means manipulating. From brutal real world experience, I\u2019ve had to face the ineffectiveness of social advice given to me online and in books. I\u2019d had to find my own ways. One key to the problems is avoiding extremism. You can be open minded enough to have a partial interest in a hobby of the person you\u2019re conversing with without going overboard and having to stay there for hours listening to that person. There\u2019s A Difference Between Open-Mindedness and People-Pleaser Yes, Dale Carnegie tells you to pay particular interest to others. But that doesn\u2019t mean having no spine and excusing yourself when it truly bores you or changing the topic of conversation. Give it five to ten minutes and then shift. You want to stray from the rigidness of only talking about your own interests, especially if you only care about video games and porn because that will drastically limit who you can talk to. But you don\u2019t want to seek validation or approval so much that you become a completely fake version of yourself. Men Misinterpret Smiling, So Be Tactful The same goes for smiling. Women have to deal with the timeless issue of men misinterpreting their warmth as a sign that they are sexually interested. Studies have shown that men are biased to assume women are interested more often than not because it was evolutionary better to err this way. But how do you counteract this? Smiling has proven to be a key biological facial behavior to display warmth and open people up. Well, you don\u2019t go to an extreme. You don\u2019t smile too much. You aren\u2019t too bubbly. You display warmth in other ways, such as with positive intonation and a good handshake. You avoid being too cold and distant but not too friendly. How about a friendly handshake rather than a hug? Being Too Nice To The Point Of Becoming Someone You\u2019re Not Carnegie recommends being nice, pleasant, and agreeable. To avoid arguments. But by taking this to an extreme, you become a servant. You become someone you\u2019re not. You become manipulative. And people see this. They recognize that you\u2019re doing something nice only to get something back. They detect that you\u2019re lying about your true opinions and interests.  Fear can turn you into pretending to be someone you\u2019re not. Fear of rejection and judgement can cause you to be overly quiet or take on personality traits that aren\u2019t you. Ironically, your fake identity ruins you since the people who like you only like the fake version of you rather than the real you. You don\u2019t express your true self by suppressing your opinions and agreeing with everything someone says to get them to agree with you. Why doesn\u2019t this advice work? It is more focused on getting people to like you whether you want to be their friend or not and whether you agree with their opinions or not. Perhaps, this might work in a government, quick-interaction business, or political scene, which is mainly the situation the book was written for. But you\u2019re looking to make real, quality, lifelong friendships. This is a common theme in the dating realm and why the phrase \u201cnice guys finish last\u201d is common. Nice guys often will become a shell of a person by agreeing with everything a girl says. In reality, he\u2019d do a better job by occasionally expressing his own opinion and sharing his own interests that may be different from the girl. Girls do like having things in common but they can SENSE when you\u2019re lying or being too agreeable to win her over and it turns her off. Here\u2019s the solution: Become somewhat outcome independent. Stop being kind in order to get something. Be kind and give for the sake of giving and enjoying the experience of being nice. Be assertive enough to stand up for yourself and value yourself so you don\u2019t get taken advantage of when you give too much to the wrong person. How To Improve Your Social Skills To Make More Friends I read in Napoleon Hill\u2019s book Positive Action Plan that in order to make a friend, you must be a friend. You attract the type of person you are. Hill studied 500 of the wealthiest people in the world over 25 years to discover this. Apparently, Bill Gates agrees: I\u2019ve learned many things from Warren over the last 25 years, but maybe the most important thing is what friendship is all about. It\u2019s about being the kind of friend you wish you had yourself. Everyone should be lucky enough to have a friend who is as thoughtful and kind as Warren. He goes out of his way to make people feel good about themselves and share his joy about life. \u2013Bill Gates I will be citing Dale Carnegie\u2019s book How To Win Friends and Influence People. This man has helped thousands of people successfully with their social skills, including Warren Buffett. Be Present and Listen Be present. Actually listen. Spend less time interrupting them and let them talk. You are not present if you are thinking of the next thing to say instead of just listening and hearing what they say. If you listen and ponder what they say, it will open you up to a bunch of interesting topics you can branch off of from there. For example, if they answer with \u201cI went to the mall and ate at Chick-Fil-A but the line was so busy.\u201d There\u2019s 3 things I could rant about: Chick-Fil-A, malls, or busy lines.. which I can then transition into anything really: I can talk about malls, add in a story about malls linked to something I want to talk about: maybe a bad hair day, transition to hair, and so on. Meet Them In Meetings and Groups Of Interest People can sense if you\u2019re really not interested. You can only take it so far. There are some topics you are just not that into. Rather than lie, pretend, and stretch yourself immensely, find people who actually like stuff you\u2019re into. It\u2019s easier. Examples include: video games, anime, rap, or yoga. If you kiss up too much and pretend to like a hobby you truly do not no matter how much you try, it\u2019s detectable and a huge turn off, especially in the dating scene. Also, try new hobbies you\u2019ve never done before to possibly open yourself up to new people and new interests. Say Their First Name Often It\u2019s so true. When people I have just met say my first name like they\u2019ve known me for years, I just feel more connected and friendly with them. Do the same thing in the same way. Keep it in a tone like you\u2019ve known them for a while. There\u2019s a certain level of familiarity and respect when you take the time to remember their name. I\u2019m really bad at first names so I am really working on this. A great memory trick I learned from world record memorization experts is to make a funny, unique, and quirky visual representation around their name and how they look to remember their name. Find Things In Common I wanted to throw in my own thing here. This didn\u2019t come from Dale Carnegie. This came from my own experiences, observations, and learning from the most social people I know. It\u2019s not rocket science. On a very essential, primal level, we humans seek to connect by relating to eachother and finding things in common. We do this very naturally. Technique You Can Use: Find 1 thing in common and 1 thing interesting about someone you meet. How To Keep A Conversation Going Scared of a conversation going dry? Scared of asking too many questions and boring people? Add in statements, your own opinions, and sentences in between your questions. Honestly, that right there will put you above most people. I have met elderly individuals who still really suck at social skills and will ask 10 questions in a row, then trail off.. Many people haven\u2019t invested a moment of their time in bettering themselves. ",

Both of you would click and become friends without even trying. As for being neglected by people, I guess the most important question is \u201cHow much do you neglect yourself?\u201d If you do, start acknowledging your self-worth. If you don't, it won't matter who else neglects you or not. Be self-confident and focus on building yourself. Once you do that, everyone around you, would start noticing you themselves.

Compliment people be like \u201c hey man you are really osum thanks for being my friend \u201c But in all of this u have to do one very important thing , get kitta your house and meet people. I'm not saying u have to party all the time , just once or twice a month works. You'll make friends if u r there for people when they need u the most. ",

            "answer_text": "There were just to many sad answers for this question to not put my two cents on the table. We, introverts make friends the same way anyone else does, we just do it less often. Being an introvert doesn\u2019t make you a leper, even if sometimes you feel like one. It makes you more observant, and you will probably choose better friends because of it. All people make friends the same way, you connect, sometimes the connection is big and sometimes it is fleeting into dust, but even dust leaves something behind. When an introvert bonds after a connection it is likely to be a lasting friendship because a connection with an introvert will never be over something shallow. And introverts never trade friends they way other societal members do, they keep the friends they have through thick and thin. ",

To all the introverts reading this Please, please try to respond actively when a stranger/an acquaintance (especially if he/she is also an introvert) talks to you. Some people may need a lot of courage to start a conversation with quiet people. When someone starts a conversation, don't be afraid. Don't be dubious. Be yourself and tell them your interesting story of the day, or funny story of the week! You could be talking to your next like-minded fella! To all the extroverts reading this Please, please take the initiative to start the conversation  (especially if he/she is an introvert). Introverts love meeting new people too! It's just that some people find it enormously hard to start a conversation with a complete stranger. Once you get to know them, you'll realize that they can talk a lot too. Don't hesitate. Start talking.  ",

            "answer_text": "Similar to how people make friends as an extrovert I\u2019m afraid. By saying hi and talking to people. Perhaps go to a small conference or convention and if someone has an interesting costume, see if you can ask a few questions. Or, if they ask an interesting question of a panelist, ask them about something related to that question after the panel. You can also encourage people talking to you, so that you don\u2019t have to start it, by creating and wearing a costume, or asking questions at a panel when audience activity is encouraged. Another potentially good way is to find a structured activity that encourages interaction with a small group in a structured sort of way. For me, this means Dungeons and Dragons, as well as some other role playing games. Try googling \u201cgame stores near me.\u201d Go in and ask the person at the counter if there are any groups for new role players, if you are new to it. College classes are another way to meet new people, especially if they have group activities. Additionally, if you are attending college (or any school), then there will be clubs. Find one or two, join them, and go to the activities. I hope these ideas help and, if they don\u2019t, I hope you receive some answers that do! ",

After 25 years of being a psych nurse, admitting people to an inpatient unit, asking them in detail what their problems were in every aspect of life, I had lost my shyness. Of course, I didn\u2019t ask these detailed questions to everyone I met, but when you\u2019re forced to ask people everything about themselves and interact therapeutically for years, it becomes much less effort. I suggested to my daughter that when she sat down in a classroom before the class started, she just start saying \u201cHi\u201d to people who sat near here. Sometimes she did, sometimes she didn\u2019t. This broke up some of her shyness. Then after undergrad she got a job with a federal agency that required she talk to people across the country and ask them the most personal questions about finances, relationships, marriages, children, money, jobs, etc. She too became less shy with practice.

If he chooses to gather in the backyard for a bbq or wants to be alone at his computer, that is fine with everyone. We all except that he likes solitude at times but anyone would be there for him anytime he needed anything at all. ",

I\u2019m off to uni next year, so I guess I\u2019ll get back to you then, that\u2019ll be an adventure. Category 1 friends I met because we shared a common interest. One I met playing a video game (specifically PAYDAY 2), we made it on each others friends list and so it went. The others I met in Scouting, they were initially category 2 until we realised we both shared an interest in 40k, and it went up from there. Category 2 friend are the ones I\u2019m forced together with for some reason. Such as sitting next to them in class, or bunking with them on a lengthy school trip, or do activities with them on a scout trip. We still have to at least share somethings. So really true friends are category 1, they come through time and a deep common interest. ",

Ok, that was probably uncalled for yet, at the same time, I think some introverted temperament types would LIKE to build their own friends. First, what are your reasons for wanting more friends? Each of us is looking for something in a friendship. Is it companionship? Someone who thinks like I do? Avoiding loneliness? Introverts may tend towards loneliness and this is the reason they want friends. Others may be happy being by themselves; I personally have one or two actual \u201cfriends\u201d (those I am close to) but I enjoy sitting at Starbucks in a park just people watching. So once you identify what you are looking for in a friendship, identify where those types are most likely to be - church? School? A club or organization? You\u2019ll have to reach out to in some way - join a group, take a class, volunteer - just make sure it lines up with YOU want out of the friendship. ",

By meeting others, then by talking to them( they might take a little more time to interact, but still they do) and then by finding common topics to talk about.

Because I know for sure the definition of friends is different between an extrovert and an introvert.

I find that people bond over shared interests as it gives them a safe place to share their interests without the fear of getting judged or ridiculed. A healthy human being should have a balanced life (including extroversion and introversion level) of course I am not saying that if you are extremely introvert you are not healthy but at this day and age, people are everywhere and introverts are bound to meet people at certain times. If you like something, find a community that gives support to that you need to keep that something going. If you find that this freaks you out because you are already imagining how many people you are gonna meet than start small. Find yourself a good and balanced amount of extrovert and introvert friends as it will gives you tremendous insights on social life in general. If you can\u2019t find one.

When I traveled with my backpack around Europe and stayed in hostels, I was looking forward to just being alone, many times I didn\u2019t feel like talking to anyone. However, this was a difficult task. Traveling, staying in hostels, and putting yourself out of your comfort zone opens your mind and forces you to look outside of yourself. What many people fail to realize, when you travel, you are never alone. You may be sitting by yourself in a hostel kitchen eating, and someone else who is traveling alone sits down next to you. Chances are that person might strike up a conversation and before you know it, he/she is joining you on your day tour. Worried about awkward situations or feeling uncomfortable? That\u2019s fine, you won\u2019t ever see these people again. You will learn skills with each person that you meet and perhaps over time you will feel more comfortable talking to people and being in social situations so when you finally return home, you are able to form relationships.

A shy person may need this help but an introvert means one who is mostly busy with his/her own thoughts. The real introvert wont try to make friends. Friends or other persons are a hassle that introverts would like to not be subjected to. If you are so much in need of friends believe me you are not an introvert you are an extrovert who is shy and afraid of what others may think of you. So you need to be more open and accepting of yourself and others. Smile more at others and try to chitchat with others whenever you can. While waiting for a bus try to check the time or seek assistance or directions. The more you will talk to people the more easier you will find to make friends slowly but steadily. ",

I look at my strengths, personality traits and what I like to do and find ways to be more social with these in mind. Like I know I do better in smaller groups and I hate small talk. So I tend to approach smaller groups or individuals. I observe them and try to find a meaningful conversation based on their interests, strengths and personality. I use my strength as a listener to analyze what they are saying and respond with a meaningful response that shows I'm interested in them and their interests, not just myself. That being said, if I don\u2019t think someone has value to my life or I have something to offer them, I don\u2019t waste my time. I\u2019m not looking for people just to say I have friends, I value deep relationships and strive to only have people in my life who truly care for me, and vice versa.

Now he really has no one to talk to in person. So I suggested him to talk to people normally like how was their day or about relations or future plans. After talking to many people he is now comfortable to share secrets with correct people. And good thing is he made some really good friends there. At the end, i would like to suggest you to share normal things but not something which is too personal. And after a couple of days if you think sharing too personal things also will not disturb your life then you are good to go with your new friends. ",
