            "answer_text": "You read a book by sitting down and reading. Set aside some time every day\u2014maybe right at the end of the day before bed, maybe at lunch. My set reading time is the first 30 minutes after I wake up.* I used to read myself to sleep every night, but I trained my body so well that whenever I picked up a book, I stared feeling unbearably sleepy. The average adult American reads about 300 words per minute when reading prose. Assuming you read slowly (250 wpm), in 30 minutes, you will read 7500 words per day, or 225,000 words in a 30 day month. Most novels tend to run about 100K words, so at just 30 minutes per day, you could read two average books or one long one every month.  *Footnote - For me, that\u2019s not the only time I read during the day. I also have a lunchtime book, and I always have a work-related book going that I can turn do on slow days at the office. But even if the day gets crazy and I find no other time to sit down and read, I\u2019ve done at least 30 minutes every single day. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to read a book is ,to fall in love with the narrator. Select the books according to your tastes and preferences , never depend a lot upon other opinions. Always keep an aim to finish reading the book within your prescribed time,maybe a month and while reading finish a chapter on a go or few pages according to the content. Feel free to read during leisure time. Set a time to read after getting up and before going to sleep. This time shouldn't be affected . You can adjust your sleep for completing a few chapters or so. The rest of your free time can be utilised for reading.If this is followed you can complete reading . Reading differs from person to person. Books are meant to be read . You must not read it only with an intention to complete it. If u really love the book you will definitely complete it. ",
