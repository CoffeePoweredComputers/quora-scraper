            "answer_text": "I am ignoring the bubonic plague since I am only looking at the US view. The plague was the worst since the death toll is comparable to the Spanish flu but the world population was much smaller during the plague.From Wikipedia \u201cThe Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide\u2014about one-third of the planet\u2019s population\u2014and killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million victims, including some 675,000 Americans\u201d The NIH website estimates the death toll at around 550,000 or 0.5 % of the then US population of 103 million.SARS-COV-2 with an estimated mortality rate of .5% could kill around 1 million Americans before we hit the assumed herd immunity threshold of 60% (60% of 330 million x 0.5) which is more than the number of Americans killed by the 1918 flu.The margin of error for SARS-cov-2 mortality estimates is high and my estimate of .5% comes from NY which is the only place that has conducted reasonably large scale antibody testing and published their findings. The threshold for herd immunity for SARS-cov-2 is also being debated. I have heard 60% as well as 70-90%. If 90% of the population has to be infected to achieve herd immunity, you are looking at 1.5 million deaths which is a much greater number than perished from the Spanish flu.Only time will tell, but the numbers suggest that covid could easily match or exceed the Spanish flu death toll unless we get a vaccine. At 108,000 dead so far, it has already passed all the others flu outbreaks in the US. ",
