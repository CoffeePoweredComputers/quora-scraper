            "answer_text": "I write short fiction and I still get royalty checks for stories I sold in 1994. If a book continually stays in print, the royalties will start getting smaller. But some anthologies don\u2019t sell that well. I\u2019m in 170 anthologies and I\u2019ve stopped receiving any money from about 150 off them. I\u2019m sure you can find copies of VAMPIRE DETECTIVES or CRAFTY CAT CRIMES on Amazon for a penny. I have several collections out and I am paid in advance for those. But until that money is made up by sales, I won\u2019t see royalties. That might take two months, it might take two years, depending on the timing of the book and if people have extra money to spend. I received a check recently for $10.03 for a story that was in an anthology in the 00s. The editor sent me a note, telling me it was for the last three years, as a business can\u2019t send a check out unless it is over ten dollars. I called him on the phone, because he seemed so apologetic in the letter, and we had a good laugh. I kidded that if I had written a longer story, I might have gotten a check for $15.00. Writing can have its fun moments. ",

            "answer_text": "No. What you might be seeing is Trad published books which fail to earn out their advance. Trad publishers give an author an advance on each book, which is an expectation of how well it will sell. The advance is contracted, specifying how many books need to sell, before the author receives further royalty payments. Most books fail to sell out the advance, so the author does not receive any royalties. Books which sell well, will eventually start paying royalties. Best sellers will start paying royalties fairly quickly, depending on the size of the advance. The bigger the advance, the longer it takes to sell out. All Indie authors get paid royalties. Monthly. There are more Indie authors than trad authors these days. There are Indie authors making 7 figures a year from royalties. ",
