            "answer_text": "It is quite difficcult to remember the exact age that I started reading books. But when I remember about the long journey, it has been quite sweet. As early as I can remember, maybe at the age of one or two, my mother read us stories from Magic Pot and Kalikkudukka. (The local children's magazines). They came on Fridays. I remember waking up early in the morning and waiting at the gate for the newspaper boy to bring them on Fridays and pestering my mother to read them out for me. They admitted me to a nursery when I was three. I was already in love with the art of reading. I insisted they teach me to read. I was too bored of playing. By 4, I was already reading magicpots myself. Apart from my parents, joining my school was a total turning point. They had a whole, beautiful library. But they would not let us borrow books until we were in 5th grade. We had to be satisfied with the fairytales and short stories that we would read in our class. The most exciting thing about entering 5th grade was getting to take books from the library. Even after so many years, I still smile when I think about those times. The first book that I read from my library was a short story collection. I don\u2019t remember whose book it was or what was it about, but I remember the red cover like yesterday. My mother was quite suprised to see me reading something with so much interest. See, I never touched my school books. From there, I read a lot. A book every other week at first which went on to become even 3 or 4 books a week. Reading Harry Potter was quite a turning point. I fell in love with the magic of fantasy books. I could not wait to read more. When I think back now, there was a point when I had become addicted to it, like I really did not want to do anything ever in my life. My school was amazing. They had a beautiful library, and encouraged all of us to read. Everybody was enthusiastic at first, but when they felt that it was kinda dying down, they introduced a new scheme. Whenever we return a book, we had to write down a review of the book and get it signed by the librarian, to take a new book. It was school policy that you cannot keep the same book for more than a month. It was irksome at first, and people begged others to write reviews for them. But everybody was caught on the difference in handwriting, and their reviews ended up in a trash. And unknowingly, eventually, everybody in my class started reading. Even if it was just a Wimpy Kid, or the Goosebumps or Sweet Valley Twins or Famous Five or a random author, everybody read. There was always someone with whom you could talk about a new book that you read. If you buy a new book, there were already 20 people in the waiting list who are behind you every moment to give it to them the next. There were always new recommendations flying in class. By the time we were in 9th grade, we did not need the reviews anymore. The school understood that we were all keen on reading, and stopped pestering us for them. I remember this horribly rude thing that we did. Our social studies teacher was quite short, and the subject she takes being the least interesting among all, everybody had a novel open inside their geography or history textbooks. Surprisingly, nobody found out for a very very long time. I was quite scared to read a novel myself, because I felt like she was watching me 24/7, but I did read snippets from the ones my bench-mates were reading from. But our class-teacher caught us one day, and she confiscated every single novel that we had with us then. She got 41 of them after checking all of our bags. Note that my class only had 36 people. That is when I actually realized how much we were into this. We were all crazy about it. I changed schools after 10th grade. Till then, I really didn\u2019t have any close relationships with people from other schools, but what waited for me at the new school was a huge shock. Hardly anybody there had ever read a novel. Many people who had just read half of a single famous five book were calling themselves readers. When I asked them about it, they all told me that their school did not have a library. Since then, I am forever thankful to my first school, for everything. They built up my life without even me knowing. School schedule soon became hectic because I was preparing for my medical entrance. There was no good library to take books from, and I didn\u2019t want my parents to spend too much money on buying books for me, I started reading ebooks. Even though the schedule was dauntingly hectic, I was stubborn that it cannot defeat my love for reading. Even thought I wasn\u2019t into it like before, I still read a couple of books a month. School life is over now. My interests in books have changed drastically. I am no more the ardent fantasy lover. I prefer realistic fiction, and autobiographies, non-fiction even. Maybe, it will change again in the coming years. But despite anything, there is one thing I am damn sure of, I would continue to read, all my life, no matter what. ",

I never had any interest in reading books or novels because they never had any pictures and i used to think that all of my creativity is going to die due to reading books. But I started regretting after I read my first novel \u201c Rich Dad Poor Dad \u201d it changed my whole mentality towards novels and today I often read novels and books based on creativity, personal development, technology, business startup, etc. Basically, my advice is that the best age to get started for reading novels and books is the age when you start writing essays in your examinations. This is a very beautiful way for developing one's personality as it develops both your writing skills and your knowledge at the same time. Hope this works for you ",

            "answer_text": "I was 10 years old. I remember very well. It was in the summer hols after 5th grade. My elder brother was already a book worm, I've seldom seen him without a voluminous book in his hands. But, back then, I wasn't really into reading. So, one day, I happened to ask him, just simply, abruptly, uninterestedly, what his first book to ever read was. Suprisingly, he remembered and even had it with him. He produced an old Enid Blyton Mystery series novel, from his ( now our) book shelf, thrust it into my hands, and left. And so began my daily hobby. Reading that 200 page kids book in 4 days was my biggest achievement . It's the absorption, you see. That anxiety to find out the next scene and the next. I still haven't reached my brother's level of vocabulary nor read as many books as he has. None in my family have any interest of this sort, it's just me and him. Our interests, desires, and perspectives are completely different from my cousins and uncles etc. My parents themselves don't read much, but they have never discouraged any of our interests. Oh, and there's one more thing I've always wanted to tell everyone I know and don't. A bookworm isn't necessarily an introverted nerd, who took to reading because he/she has no friends. lololol. It isn't true at all. I have lots of friends and I am unafraid of exerting my oratory abilities whenever necessary. My brother, dear me, is the biggest extrovert I've ever met. ",

As the years progressed , I turned to books of fantasy and adventures like the \u2018Famous Five' series, \u2018 Treasure Island', the 'Harry Potter' series. In my early teens, I read a lot of classics like 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Eyre\u2019, \u2018 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', 'The Three Musketeers\u2019, 'Little Women',etc. It was during this time that I discovered my love for literature and began reading books in earnest. Today I feel as if they are an important part of my life. They tell me stories that move my soul and inspire my creative faculty. Their innumerable pages contain the essence of Life and encourage me to work hard and persevere towards my goal. They have also taught me important lessons about life, friendship, courage, loyalty, dreams, love and hardships. So, keep reading ",

            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of people as far as the art of reading is concerned. The one timers and the infinite timers. Definitely a classic like Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion and more precisely Lady Susan with a mature storyline and subtle social isssues requires a mature mind to appreciate it, definitely once you have already tasted the vinegar aspects of world. But a teenaged mind would be more than happy to just have been introduced to the wild foray of love dalliance so explicitly stated in these novels. Also a thoroughly mature novel like Madame Bovary and Arden Shakespeare\u2019s Midsummer night\u2019s dream requires time of life surpassing middle age. So you should decide whether you are one time reader or an infinite one and then take a plunge. Also make it sure that you have ample time to complete the novel and be with it through the thick and thin, both its juicy and sapless parts and also forgive yourself for ignoring for some days, because completing a sensible novel is no trifle.

I remember rading books in my 4th and 5th grade so I was around ten years old when I started reading. Although I do remember that my first ever full length novel was Oliver twist which I read when I was in 5th grade. I must say that although I didn't fully understand all the aspects of it, I really loved that book and thus I read all the Charles Dickens novels after that (which were similar to Oliver twist)like Nicholas nickelby, David Copperfield, etc. Most of the books available in our school library were Jane Austen and Bronte sisters classics so my reading had a solid start. Not to mention all the Goosebumps and Sherlock Holmes books I read. All this makes me so nostalgic. Nancy drew , Ruskin bond , Malgudi days , Daddy long legs..thats where one part of my reading experience ended. The second part started with harry Potter series and oh my God! I am one of those people who is still waiting for that letter(but I am 17 already so..)I am such a huge fan that my friend made me a Hogwarts letter and it brought tears to my eyes. So harry Potter was followed by hunger games , divergent and some other series. Then came the touching contemporary phase where I read everything from John green to .., well let's just say I read lots. Now I am on a break from books just for a while though because I am desperately waiting for that book release on November 7th and then we'll see. Byee ",

            "answer_text": "Well reading an array of books has certainly been an journey to me.All of it started when i was in 10th. Being an ICSE student i had, what i would consider, \u201cdecent\u201d English. We had these English grammar classes in which we would be asked to write essays as homework and then read them aloud for the class and we would be marked on 25. It was in these classes that i felt the need to improve English and take it a step further;my English teacher was happy with my language and asked me to add finesse to it. I had this friend who had a taste for reading , you know novels and stuff. And so with a friend at my side with a similar inclination to explore language, i set on\u2026 And that\u2019s also when i got addicted to reading novels. By luck, i had this folder full of novels; my elder brother gave me his computer when he left for his job. Started with Immortals of meluha,I literally ate that book in span of 48 hrs(I was on vacation at my uncles n that\u2019s where i got hold of that book). delighted at the feat i requested my sister to get me the whole series;loved the experience. Soon devoured myself in Harry potter (I started reading it on the day after i had my hindi BOARD paper and gulped down the whole series before the exams ended that was in 20days) Harry potter became an addiction to me.I started reading it again but with little more maturity\u2026considered and gave facts and characters profound thought, and understood the substance of the story. And I\u2019m still on with my thirst for novels and books . ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think I started reading novels at very early age but yes, I started reading short stories at my very early age. When I was a child I used to finish my whole Hindi course book in one single day, the day I bought the book. Yes, I\u2019m not kidding. I remember, shouting and calling my mother and showing her that I read the whole book. I used to read \u2018champak\u2019 , \u2018nandan\u2019, \u2018nanhe samrat\u2019 and many other books as almost every child does. I was no different.   Then, about when I was in third standard, I started reading comics, hindi comics. My favourite characters were Super Commando Dhruv and Nagraj. I got this habit from a cousin of mine who used to read them and was much elder than me. Ironically, I stopped reading comics 4\u20135 years earlier than I reached his age. Reason? Read below. When I went to my boarding school, there was a teacher who used to tell us the stories from R.K.Narayan\u2019s Malgudi Days. That started creating a urge inside me to read books comprising of single stories. The habit of my elder brother also added to my curiosity and will. Btw, I went to that school in sixth standard.  When I was in seventh grade I read my first novel(it was for my age group as it seems after reading it). It was Famous Five by Enid Blyton followed by Secret Seven by the same author.  When I was in eighth grade, I read novel 2 States by Chetan Bhagat. That made me read his other novels such as Five Points Someone, Three mistakes of my life(actually I was curious to read about his second mistake which now seems very foolish and unworthy of curiosity), Revolution 2020, Half Girlfriend(later).  Till now, I have read several novels such as a walk to remember, the notebook, harry potter(first two parts), the murder of Roger Ackroyd, Tell me your dreams, Thirteen Reasons Why and many more. For last two to three years I lost my reading habit because of JEE preparations and I am trying to read as much as I can now. I have set a few targets to read particular novels and hope I will be able to complete them.   For now I am reading a book, that was a part of my class ninth curriculum which I felt boring at that time. The book is My India The India Eternal by Swami Vivekananda and one another book How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie(these two are not really novels but books to learn few things). Besides I plan to read a several other thriller and love story novels.   ",

It was the age at which our school library starts lending books to children. (Alice in the Wonderland) It was a turning point in life, I protected the book like an over-protective mother.

So I guess I started reading at the age of 5, my mother would always take us to amazing libraries once or twice or twice a week since me and my brother dwelled at the top of the class and no tuitions so we had plenty of free time. My school was also very good, they encouraged reading. I read the Harry Potter series when I was in third grade. Hope this helped ",

I loved the book and it still remains one of my favourite novels. While I was reading it, I was lost in a beautiful world. I understood each and every word and felt emotions. I just loved reading. Next, I decided to read other books by the author and finally started reading. And today after 8\u20139 months from reading that book, I am still reading novels anf books. Thank You! ",

There was this magazine named MAGICPOT which my father used to bring for me and it had short stories with animal characters and some activities. After the magicpot phase I moved on to CHAMPAK which was a very popular fortnight periodical then. I was first introduced to novels in my 5th grade when I started reading books by Enid Blyton and then moved on to Hardy Boys and Harry Potter series. As I grew up I started experimenting by reading books of different genres and also started getting into more serious works. And now reading has become a revered hobby!! ",
