            "answer_text": "Likely very little. Most businesses already have a subscription to an ISP, especially if they do in-house sales like a coffee shop would. Credit card transactions would be processed over the internet. The only cost for providing WiFi to customers would be buying a decent router and/or access point(s), and if necessary paying an IT contractor to setup a guest network. The only additional recurring cost would be the minimal increase of electricity usage for the new equipment unless they choose equipment that requires licensing fees. ",

            "answer_text": " Image : Credit The cost will depend on the type of WiFi you wanted to use as in the cable materials, type of modem and enhancement. It also depends on how big you want the range is (to make sure every customer regardless of their position inside the coffee shop to receive Internet signal). Generally speaking, the cost to set a WiFi will be around $300-$350 to install a standard computer network with 200 feet of cable, equipped with a standard modem. To give access to a customer you need to buy a router, and the price also depends on the type of router you want and the amount, if you want to be cost efficient, you can buy a cheap router just for $20. So to estimate you just need to add $300-$350 with the total of router you need.  Hope it helps, OKportal Technology ",
