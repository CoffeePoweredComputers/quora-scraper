            "answer_text": "You have not said where you are from, so it is difficult to be precise as English grammar varies so much round the world. Writing non fiction: British grammar: Don\u2019t. Use reported speech within double quotation marks at all times. US grammar: It is acceptable to use single quote marks within double quotation marks. Fiction: If you want to be geeky about it: British grammar: Either use double quotation marks within double quotation marks, which looks clunky or use reported speech within double quotation marks. US grammar: Use single quote marks withing double quotation marks. Otherwise: dialogue within fiction is an art form; how we construct that dialogue using grammar is also an art form. Dialogue in fiction should be seen as an extension of a particular character\u2019s personality\u2014how we speak can define how others see us. I often use different grammar conventions for separate characters, this way the reader can identify who is speaking without me having to always use an identifier. Personally, I normally use either reported speech or single quotes within double quotes, (I think this convention looks clean and everyone understands what it means), depending on the character, their personality, and what I want to convey through that particular piece of dialogue. However, (and grammar geeks round the world will choke at this) when it comes to fiction, provided the grammar fits your writing style and character personality, anything goes. The main test is whether the grammar you use clearly conveys the meaning you intend to convey. Regards, Nick ",
