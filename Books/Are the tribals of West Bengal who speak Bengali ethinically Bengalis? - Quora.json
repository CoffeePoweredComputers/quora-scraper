            "answer_text": "Bengalis can be defined in two ways- those who stay in West Bengal or Bangladesh; and those who speak Bangla as their mother tongue. Tribals or Adivasis in bengal, \u201cSantal\u201d, \u201cKol\u201d,\u201dMunda\u201d and others are not native Bangla speaking communities . They have their own beautiful and distinct languages, culture and heritage. It would be unfair to linguistically categorize them as Bengalis . However, in a broader sense, they are Bengalis because they are the real inhabitants of Bengal. Bengalis are anthropologically a mixed race. Different tribes have their own language, different regions have their own dialects. The shared values, rituals, traditions and history are the elements, which unite us. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably you mean ethnically. Please understand that Bengalis are a mixed ethnic race and it is very difficult to ascertain exact ethnicity of each group. However, Adivasis or tribals living in either Bengal or any other state identify themselves on the basis of their ethnic group as Kol, Munda, Santhal etc. and not on linguistic basis. ",
