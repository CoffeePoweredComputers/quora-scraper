            "answer_text": "Yes. The mechanical systems used are designed to be truly random. That\u2019s why they\u2019re mechanical and not a computer algorithm or mathematical equation (which could be used to create a computer algorithm). The machines and balls are routinely changed to prevent wear from creating predictability, and there are several machines and sets of balls in use. Which ones are used for a particular draw are selected at random. I've worked with \u201crandom\u201d number generators, and have created some. Computerized ones using mathematical formulas are \u201cpseudo-random\u201d and will eventually repeat themselves, but (hopefully) only after an exceptionally long time. Some are better than others. These are useful for modeling processes that have random variation to measure general system behavior and the probabilities of having one desired outcome versus others. Example: for a manufacturing system with several variations in its processes, it can be used to predict what are the product pass/fail probabilities are at the end of the line. It cannot predict if or when the next one will pass or fail, nor can a true random generator, but a good pseudo-random generator more than suffices. The random number generator in all spreadsheet programs is actually pseudo-random. Some are better than others. When true random number generation is needed, such as the keys for one-time message encryption pads, it\u2019s done mechanically and it\u2019s time consuming. The mechanical systems used to create one-time pad keys are designed to be so ultra hyper-sensitive to initial starting conditions that predicting a pattern is completely impossible. The result is unbreakable. Even brute force cannot be used. Lottery ball drop machines, while not identical, use the same ultra hyper-sensitivity principles in their designs. ",

            "answer_text": "America's popular and lucrative lottery drawings, in which computers randomly select numbers that turn a lucky few into instant millionaires, may not be as random as they seem. In dozens of the games across the United States, identical winning numbers have been generated within weeks or months of each other sometimes in consecutive drawings. Lottery officials, even some who have previously acknowledged concern with the national lottery system, contend the repeated numbers are nothing more than chance. While such repeats are rare and uncommon, there is no reason to suspect these numbers were not drawn reasonably. But critics of random-number drawings contend that the identical draws. Coupled with records identifying problems in several states with random number computer generators, demonstrate that the fairness and integrity of the nation\u2019s $80.5 billion annual lottery system are compromised. The problems are aggravated by the lack of national oversight, those critics contend. It suggests that there are outliers, and it suggests it's worthy of investigation. Already, several states, including Iowa, Arizona, Connecticut and South Carolina, have identified problems with random number generated lotteries, and some have ended games because of the problems. Using data of winning drawings in 37 states collected by the website LotteryPost, the Register identified more than 100 drawings over the past 25 years where the same game generated identical winning lottery numbers within 365 days of each other. The Register reviewed only those lottery games that select at least five numbers, because those games generally have a smaller probability of having the same numbers drawn twice. ",

            "answer_text": "Most lottery games (certainly the \u201cbig\u201d ones, like Powerball) use mechanical generators. A set of balls with numbers painted on them are released into a box with turbulent airflow, which mixes the balls. The agent responsible for the drawing opens a valve which allows the air to flow out of the box through a tube. This causes a random ball to be sucked into the tube, which cuts off the airflow, and the number painted on the ball is the drawing number. The process is repeated until the necessary number of balls have been drawn. There\u2019s really no proper definition of what it means for something to be \u201ctruly randomly generated\u201d. This entire process I described can be modeled deterministically, so that one could, in theory, predict which ball is selected by knowing detailed properties of the state of the machine. In practice, it\u2019s not possible to know enough about the state of the machine. You can\u2019t get access to make the measurements, and there\u2019s no way to do it remotely. Also, they typically have a rotating set of such machines, and the machine used for the drawing is chosen rather late and the choice is not made public. So, all you can really ask is whether, given published information about the past outcomes from the machine, you can model the outcome better than a uniform distribution. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who isn\u2019t trying to sell a system to \u201cbeat\u201d the lottery that would actually claim you can. And the ones selling systems aren\u2019t trustworthy anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "State run lotteries are absolutely not fixed. There is no reason to fix the lotto. Generally the state gets half of the money taken in and the winners share the remaining half. Most lotteries have physically transparent operating systems which allow television viewers to watch the numbered balls being drawn. There is just not much chance of, \u201cfixing\u201d the drawing. The chance of winning a large lotto is usually more that 100 million to 1 odds so the game does not have to be fixed.  A gravity-pick Lotto machine There are two main types of Lotto machines: gravity pick and air mix. The machines have a few things in common: They are designed and proven using statistical analysis to produce random combinations of numbers.The balls are always visible during the mixing and drawing process -- they never disappear inside tubes or chambers. This helps prevent tampering; and since the drawings are televised live, it gives the viewer confidence that the drawing is not being fixed.The gravity-pick machine is perceived to be more secure than the air-mix machine, perhaps because of a tampering incident that occurred in 1980 in Pennsylvania. One common type of gravity-pick machine uses solid rubber balls. The balls are dropped into a chamber where two paddles, which spin in opposite directions, mix the balls. The operator actuates a sliding door at the bottom of the mixing chamber. One at a time, six balls pass through a clear tube into a clear display area where the numbers can be read. An optical sensor detects the passage of each ball, allowing only the correct number of balls to pass through the doorway.   An air-mix Lotto machine The other type of machine that is commonly used for Lotto is the air-mix machine. This type of machine uses ping-pong balls that are painted with numbers and carefully calibrated for size and weight. These balls are released into the machine and jets of air blow up through the chamber to mix them. To select a set of balls, the operator opens a valve that allows air out of the machine through a tube or a set of tubes near the top of the machine. Once the valve is open, balls are blown into the tube; they are then transferred through another clear tube into a display area for reading. Since 1980, security procedures have improved. Here are some of the ways in which different states ensure the security of their lottery drawings: The New York Lottery maintains several duplicate sets of Lotto balls. A set is chosen at random before each drawing.The balls are weighed before and after each drawing to make sure no tampering has taken place.The equipment is all kept in a locked vault until just before the drawing",

While its true that 5 consecutive numbers for example never happens this is simply mathematics given the number of different combinations possible, in reality 5 consecutive numbers has as good a chance of being drawn as 5 non-consecutive numbers.  There are a lots of \"a butterfly flaps it wings\" theories like the amount of paint on the balls as Jeremy Miles said, although in Europe people usually say its ball 38 (probably because ball 38 comes up more in EuroMillions and 44 comes up more in Powerball etc.).  If there is any truth to these theories then the variable is so miniscule that for all practical purposes it makes no difference.  Co-incidentally, in quite a few lotteries the number 13 shows up less than other numbers, so believe what you'd like from that! (: ",

            "answer_text": "If lottery winning numbers were not really random, would it possibly increase your chances of winning? Possibly yes, because if they were not random, it would mean you could use certain algorithms to figure out which number might end up winning. On the basis of this strategy, you would only buy the numbers, which you predict to win. A lot of people try to figure out some form of a pattern in lottery ticket draws. Experts suggest that there is really no pattern to it and winning numbers always happen to be random.  Lottery enthusiasts around the world still swear by a certain pattern that they use to pick their lottery tickets. This has a lot to do with controlling, getting into specifics and figuring out the best way to cover the desired sequence of numbers. Some of them even try and study the history of the lottery draw that they plan to invest in. Indian lottery enthusiasts can now try playing the international lotteries on Lottoland, which is one of the world\u2019s leading online lottery providers. If you can try and study the patterns involved with some of the international lotteries offered by Lottoland, you can possibly increase your chances of winning a ticket yourself. In the end, it is about some amount of homework from your end if you do not want to rely purely on the luck factor. While no computer algorithm has been known to predict a lottery draw, it does not completely rule out the possibility of a pattern. They might only be difficult to understand, but with some form of study, you can try and increase your chances of a win. ",

The function in the computer languages I have looked at, generally rely on a \u201cseed\u201d which is a number derived from the exact time that the function is invoked, as measured by the computer's internal clock, and using the least significant 4 or 5 digits of that time in milli- or micro-seconds.

Perhaps you have wondered how predictable machines like computers can generate randomness. In reality, most random numbers used in computer programs are pseudo-random, which means they are generated in a predictable fashion using a mathematical formula. This is fine for many purposes, but it may not be random in the way you expect if you're used to dice rolls and lottery drawings.  ",

If there are 100 balls, some balls might have a 1.00001% chance while others a .99998% chance of being selected.   With enough observations one could guess with ever increasing certainty on which balls have a higher chance of appearing and then use that information to increase their odds.  However the odds of winning vs the price of the ticket would still make playing the lottery a losing gamble. Also, the balls are changed every so often which makes previous observation useless.   ",
