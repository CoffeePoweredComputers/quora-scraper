            "answer_text": "I, for some reason, had a strong hatred of Harry Potter for most of my life, even though I had never read any of the books. I never hesitated to state this opinion when anyone asked. So imagine my surprise and veiled disgust when I was given the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, for my 11th birthday. I didn\u2019t want to be rude to my parents, so I said thank you and grudgingly started to read the book. I expected my suspicions to be confirmed, that Harry Potter was boring and stupid. Oh, How wrong I was. I was slowly enraptured by the story of a mistreated 11 year-old who made glass vanish mysteriously and was invited to the greatest magical school in England, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. My memory is a bit vague, but I never stopped reading and finished really early in the morning. Once I woke up at the proper hour, I told my parents I has finished the book, and how much fun it was sharing the adventures of the Golden Trio. My father went ito the basement and brought out the next two books, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I was so excited, and started reading the books immediately. I finished CoS at some ungodly hour, went to sleep, and did the exact same thing for PoA the next day. My parents didn\u2019t have any more of the books, and were stunned that I finished all 3 so quickly. I wasn\u2019t able to go to the library, so I had to deal with the withdrawal until the weekend. I checked out Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and finished it at the same ungodly hour as the others. I forgot about Harry Potter until I found Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at a garage sale about a year later. I waited until I got home, and the proceeded to read all 830 pages in 4 hours. My brain hurt after doing that, so turned my room into a hideout for the rest of the day. I used the library and checked out Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows the next day, then finished these over the next 2 days. So, not including the time spent acquiring the books, I finished the Harry Potter series in a little under a week. Including this time, I spent a little over a year. I\u2019m still rather addicted to the series today, and have read the books again at least 3 times each. I\u2019m still trying to get my hands on the Elder Wand, Harry Potter\u2019s Wand, and Lord Voldemort\u2019s. Ironically, Voldemort\u2019s probably one of my favorite characters, if not my favorite. You\u2019ll stay with me? Until the end. Stay close to me. Always. ",

            "answer_text": "Although a trivial question, I would like to answer it because I have a story about reading the fifth book of the series: The Order of the Phoenix. I usually take 3-4 days to read HP sized books. And the same is true for all HP books except the fifth one. While reading The Order of the Phoenix, somewhere around page 150, a friend came up to me and we talked a bit about the book (he had read it already). He said that there's still a lot of pages left and I said \"yes, around 600 more to go\". To which he said that the most he had read in a day was ~400 pages. The next thing I know, we are having a bet on whether I can finish the rest of the book before midnight. It was about 3 in the afternoon and I realized that I'd have to read more than 1 page/min if I had to be anywhere close to finishing it. Anyways, I have a habit of taking up bets blindly, and I said \"we're ON, bro!\". And guess what, I even raised the stakes on it. (A Subway Meal). I skipped everything for the rest of the day. Tea, snacks, dinner, shower, calls(took a few) and what not. I finished the book at around 2 AM that night. I lost the bet (which I thought I would), but I was glad that I finished the book. It was a personal best. On the other hand, I was hungry, had nothing to eat and went to sleep on an empty stomach! ",
