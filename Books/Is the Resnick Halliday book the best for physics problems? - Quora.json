            "answer_text": "ABOUT THE BOOK- This book contains a lot of theory with sufficient number of real life examples, which will help you understand the topic in a very detailed manner. I would recommend it to you only if you do not understand any topic of H C Verma, because the chapters have much more explanation than is required for JEE Main and Advanced. The questions present at the end of the chapters are good and mostly inspired by some real life example, so it will be interesting to solve those questions. Frankly speaking, this is one of the toughtest book to complete but if you have any theoritical doubt ,this is the first book i will suggest to refer.This book has very high reputation worldwide. ",
