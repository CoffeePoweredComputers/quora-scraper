            "answer_text": "Hi Tim ! Thank you for your question \u2026Your questions are always more \u201c original\u201d \u2026not just a version of a question asked 500 times!:) Some insecurities I carried, came from people who I really believe loved me. That's right. I KNOW they did, they were just not informed. Mine centered around a medical deficiency that I THOUGHT would prevent me from doing things other people did. It was a doctor who had to \u201creprogram\u201d my mind on these things. Not a psychiatrist, just a medical doctor. People who raise Us sometimes hinder us, NOT because they mean to. ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO GET A PROFESSIONAL OPINION before believing you CAN'T do this or that. I've seen this situation before, where children were too \u201c coddled\u201d (is this how you spell it?) because of an illness, and they were insecure to do so many things as they got older. They thought themselves too weak, or incompetent. They were CONVINCED of it over many years ! I'm sure doctors are AMAZED at some of these stories all the time. For instance I've known parents who will tell me their adult child \u201c will never be able to do this, or never be able to care for themselves,\u201d etc., and I'm SURE there are conditions THAT debilitating, don't get me wrong. But gosh, I've also seen people WAY worse off, who are completely independent (even to my surprise) under minimal supervision and controlled by the right amount of a medication. And their independence gives them life ! But some people will NEVER get there, because it has been drilled in their heads THEY CAN'T\u2026it's just impossible ! Medical science has worked in tremendous ways to enable us in ways that before in history, certain conditions imprisoned us. Always make sure to ask medical teams for a second opinion. On the smaller scale, like insecurity about just \u201cfunctioning\u201d socially with people, there too, are the guidance counselors in a multitude of areas. For the individual issues, there is a specialist who will help pull you up and OUT of the \u201c insecurity\u201d that is holding you BACK. Other people with your same EXACT insecurity have progressed further, BECAUSE of these professional counselors. It is so important to sweep those insecurities BACK, back out of your way to be the entire YOU, and push forward in the directions you want. ",

            "answer_text": "Insecurity is from lack in childhood, it can either be physical or emotional lack. Think of yourself as overly starved of something. It can be understanding, time, dependability, stability, trust\u2026etc Due to the lack, the child formed beliefs related to the lack of emotional provision to her/his self identity, as all children will do, such as: I am not important, I am not lovable, I am ugly, its my fault\u2026 Etc. Reference: attachment theory And this belief of your past experience becomes your core value of your identity. Its this core identity that is sooooo fucking hard to change. (I don\u2019t usually use f word but I wanted to stress how hard it is) I relate because I am well aware of my own insecurities and even all the layers associated to it. So the layer works like this: 0\u20132 years old: how well parents provided for your emotional, physical needs determined how secure you feel for your own self worth. Your first layer of belief forms answering the question: Am I important enough? Am I loved? Will my loved ones be dependable? In adulthood, this surfaces as subconcsious or even unconscious beliefs sometimes. Often seemingly irrational fears. Such as fear of loved ones leaving, loved ones not wanting you, etc. 2 \u20135 year olds: how well you associate with parents and some playmates still mattered greatly to your self worth. Answering questions like: who am I in relation to the world around me? Who do I want to become? This goes on top of the first layer like an onion, forming phrases in your head. 5\u201312 year olds: this is where you pick your identity for your future role as an adult. Answering: what kind of person I want to be? What jobs will I do? What kind of title do I have in my community? (\u201cGrow up to be cops, nurses, doc, artists etc) 12+: you are starting to explore your sexual identity as you sexually mature at this age. And how you see yourself relating to others socially, sexually will form another layer of identity, this one is quite complex as well, you also develop your political, social identity from all these interactions. There is light at the end of the tunnel though, if you first can pay attention to your feelings and try to write it down, then look for the first memory you have related to it, the flash backs you got for feeling this way, its your clue to why you are feeling it. After you found the clue, you have to work to make that experience a different one.  From my own experience: I am used to my parents, namely my father not listening to me, cutting me off, or brushing my opinions off. Belief from that: My opinion is not important= I am not important. What I need to go through: I needed to understand my father did not get emotional security where he lived. So he could not give it to me, and forgives him for my lack. Then I need to find comfort, and start finding ways, materials, which can help me feel my voice is important. What I try to do now: Speak up my opinion, make sure I say what I think to my husband, (someone much gentler) and not keep it in my head. After success of speaking and being accepted by a loving party, I take that little new gained confidence to try it else where. Its like a little girl learning it all over again. It takes conscious effort, sometimes it is really really hard not to do my default mode, which is hiding my thoughts. While doing this, I have to keep my adult responsibility in check and not dump all my needs to 1 person because that\u2019s too heavy. If you have someone who can help you with acceptance, practice with them, think of you having a kid inside that the adult you need to teach and change. It will take time, its doable, but do take your time to heal your own inner child and give yourself grace. Best of hopes to your recovery. ",
