            "answer_text": "Definitely. While the original form of the challenge was to write a fiction book of at least 50,000 words in 30 days, there is a vibrant and lively NaNo Rebel community that uses NaNoWriMo for other writing projects. During the legendary 2009 Troth NaNoWriMo Team Run (which later inspired the NaNo Quorans team runs and Blog/Space ), we had a number of hearty rebels, including our leader and founder, Ben Waggoner, who endeavored to translate \u2018Hrolfs saga Gautrekssonar\u2019 from the original Old Norse. Likewise, we had a participant who used NaNoWriMo to write a nonfiction religious devotional book. I used the run to write a massive revision of a previously unfinished story, which became my first win[1] . All these and more are valid approaches to NaNoWriMo. The purpose of the challenge is to stretch your writing muscles, connect with your fellow writers, and grow as writers. What genre or mode you choose is entirely up to you. If you\u2019re interested in taking part in November NaNoWriMo as part of a team on Quora, want to see how a team works, or want to discuss NaNo and share content about it, there is now a Space for this: NaNo Quorans. And yes, Fan Fiction Rebels are welcome there and on our yearly team. Footnotes[1] Edward Conway's post in Ed's Writing Excerpts",

At least for the camp nanowrimo, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the same, but I would have to check on the main website. And there\u2019s nothing stopping you from doing what you want. The goal is to write during that month. For the traditional Nanowrimo, it\u2019s 50,000 words in the month of November, and you can do whatever. It doesn\u2019t even have to be one project, or even a complete novel, it just has to make the goal and be validated through the site. Validation is where you copy and paste your project and I assume it counts how many words to prove you did it. According to them, they scramble it up and I\u2019m not sure they even store it anywhere. ",

Someone else already did the heavy lifting of character and milieu development, so (aside from the potential plagiarism aspect) it seems a bit like cheating. If there was a prize to be won, I might care more, but the only one you\u2019re hurting by writing unpublishable fan fiction is yourself, so have at it. ",
