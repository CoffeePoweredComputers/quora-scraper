            "answer_text": "No. Men have the advantage of history, in that historically women in most cultures weren\u2019t generally permitted the same level of education as men. As a result, the vast majority of literature is made up of male authorship, up until the later 18th Century, where woman gradually started to gain prominence.

Many male authors use female pen names because the genre they are working in is associated with female authors. My brother was an entertainer and published under his girlfriends name as he didn\u2019t want people to expect his act to mirror his books. ",
