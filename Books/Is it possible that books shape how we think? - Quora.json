            "answer_text": "Yes, but that is a two-way (book and me), even a three-way (book, my community and me) street. Two-way: A lone individual unconsciously interprets the book based on who they are, yet who one is already has been shaped genetically and by ones community. Three-way: A book read in a group, or with knowledge/memory of an interpretive tradition, will greatly shape and constrain how one interprets the book\u2014and how one thinks. PSA major issue I have with the Quora community is that many atheists in the western world are former believers, or were raised by former believers\u2014believers in an extremely literal, conservative brand of religion. \u2014So there is this constant internal debate between fundamentalists and ex-fundamentalists, that loses sight of 99% of the alternatives.
