            "answer_text": "Being a young person, you will be lied to - A LOT. This is because, if you are not already a family member of someone important within the various writing mediums, you will be told \u201cgo out and get some experience and then we can talk\u201d \u2014 and all the while these same people who just told you this hire those, even younger than yourself, to some apprentice writing position because they are relatives or children of influencial friends, instead of hiring you. Want proof? Look at the total lack of quality writing on some TV shows and some magazines and books, because incompetence prefers to work with its own. This was, at least, my direct experience at your age. Today, however, we live in a remarkable technological time when anyone, at any age, can write whatever they like and find a platform online, whereby they can produce and place their work on some well-known platform. Today, there is not the height of stigma in Independent Publishing as I knew in the 1980s but as the internet has grown and such platforms as Amazon-Kindle have been flourishing, you can publish and potentially sell your work. I say, potentially, because selling your work is a lot harder than writing your work, and the only real obstacle is if you don\u2019t even have a little money to take advantage of the advertising that is available. Nothing is really free, although you can produce and place books on Amazon, for free, and it will depend on the level of quality you are capable of creating. Amazon is not the only platform but it is, in my view, one of the best, offering both print on paper and eBooks. To see the whole process Amazon-Kindle has a great number of videos showing the process available on YouTube. For other platforms you will need to spend some time in researching the question, but Google is a great search engine for this task. If you take the tradional publishing route, and you are lucky to get a publisher to accept seeing what you have written, don\u2019t ever tell them your age, and if you are under 18, be prepared to have a parent present during any contract that is signed.

You can use publishing platforms like Ingramspark or Lulu to self publish. Get your book edited, formatted, purchase an ISBN and have a cover designed for you and you can upload your book to the publisher if you\u2019re self publishing.
