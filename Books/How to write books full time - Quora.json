            "answer_text": "Your question is vague. Do you want to know how you can write full time or how you can make a living by only writing books? I presume it\u2019s the latter. To write full time you just have to do that - write. At least 8\u201310 hours a day. As for making a living, writing is an uncertain occupation. Like an engineer, after going through four to six years of formal engineering education, has his job cut out. There\u2019s a specific method of designing and building bridges, houses, high-rise buildings. Even a doctor has in-depth knowledge of the various body organs - how they function, how viruses/germs affect their functions, and which chemicals are used to treat various illnesses. So when they complete their graduation, they are quite capable of earning a decent income. With writing, there\u2019s no such rule. A layman who doesn\u2019t possess a degree in writing can write books which earn millions, while someone with a master\u2019s degree in Creative Writing might never hit the jackpot. There are no formulae in writing which will guarantee that a million people will buy your book. You have to write, read, write, read, teach yourself about styles, story structures, characterisation, again write, write, write and put your books out in the market. Many writers have confessed that a writer needs to write 5 to 6 books (which are published too) before s/he can really afford to kick that day job which helps to manage their living expenses. ",

            "answer_text": "You write a book and hope it sells massively. If it does, you write another book and sell it massively. If that happens, you are now writing books full time (i.e., you have given up your job and all you do now is focus on writing your next books and enjoy life).Do you have what it takes to write a book? That is, can you use the language correctly? Can you use the language better than others can? Can you use it in surprising ways? Do you have special content to share, which others would really like to plunge into? Can you get to that audience?If the answer to the questions above is in the affirmative, you can embark on this journey; good luck! ",
