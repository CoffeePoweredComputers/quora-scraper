            "answer_text": "Research is all about curiosity, asking lots of questions and getting your hands dirty. In terms of books I might start by reading what some of our more creative scientist have written and maybe some top rated science videos, which would help in better understanding the mindset of a scientist. Examples might include material from Richard Feynman such as his book, Surely, You\u2019re Joking Mr. Feynman and his superb set of 6 lectures (Meisner Lectures) given in the 1960s on the Character of Physical Laws (can find on the Internet). I would also look at the following science videos: Cosmos (also the newer version by Neil deGraase Tyson) by Carl Sagan and The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski. ",
