You have to study NCERT for these exams to strengthen your concepts and basics, but you also need some additional books for competitive exams like DC Pandey for Physics that have high level question to learn how to apply concepts that you learn from NCERT books to solve those problems. In short - NCERT books clear the conceptscompetitive book tell you how to think according to question and apply those concepts.They are complementary halves of each other. Also you should practice previous years papers to familiarize yourself with pattern and question formats. You can easily get these secondhand additional preparation books and NCERT books for FREE and delivered right to your home, from MyPustak. You just need to create an account on website search the books and order it.  Hope this helps you!! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all there is  a lot of difference between board exams and Competitive exams. You need a different preparation for both of them. Obviously you will study NCERT books for your board exams and that will give you the knowledge about all the concepts. Now for competitive exams such as JEE and VITEEE one needs to apply these concepts in a more productive way. These exams will test your speed and your ability of how fast you understand the question and what necessary concept you need to apply for a particular question. So i would suggest you to practice previous years question papers or any other material to get to know how the questions are asked,you will get a clear idea of how to prepare. considerable practice will yield you success. All the best for your exams ",
