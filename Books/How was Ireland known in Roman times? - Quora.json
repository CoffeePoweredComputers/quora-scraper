            "answer_text": "Ireland was known as Hibernia in Roman times and it was a barbarian island. The Romans did sail around the island, to check it really was an island, and it is most likely they set foot on it too. They made a list of the different tribes that lived on the island and it is likely they studied it to some extent. However, after deciding there was not much worth having they decided it was not worth their effort to occupy it and colonise it. I suspect they could not quite believe there was somewhere with worse weather than Britannia. ",

            "answer_text": "How was it known about as against what was it known as? Easy - anybody with a half decent boat who sailed the Irish Sea would have seen it and possibly traded or raided (or both) there. Likewise, anybody living on the British west coasts or along rivers to the Irish Sea - be they Briton, Roman or whatever probably had occasional Irish visitors - trading and/or raiding. Naturally, all communicated news of this western isle and its people. ",
