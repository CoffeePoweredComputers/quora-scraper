            "answer_text": "Yes, I have. I don't talk about it, or him, much, if at all, but it is a memory that I will probably never be able to forget, and the guilt I associate with it will likely never fade. It was a little over 10 years ago now\u2026  The year was 2008, and I was just a 15-year old kid when it all started. My parents had divorced when I was a toddler, and my Mom, who had won custody, remarried a few years later. My childhood was largely unremarkable up to that year. My younger brother, elder sister, and I lived with our Mom and Dan in the North Houston suburb of Spring. There were some social tensions in school for all of us, as we had moved from a \u201cpoorer\u201d district, and the other children knew it. However, there was never any \u201creal\u201d danger or harassment. Even still, the mild bullying I experienced, combined with my stubborn, combative nature, greatly shaped the way I would deal with problems throughout my adolescence. At first, our makeshift family got along reasonably well. It wasn't until around my Freshman year of High School that we started having serious problems in the house. It was 2007 then, and my sister was 17-years old, and she, too, had a penchant for violent problem-solving. This had, in the past, been the cause of conflict between the 3 of us kids, but especially between me and her. At this time, however, her fights were almost all with Mom, or Dan. These battles lasted for most of that year until, after one particularly explosive fight between the 3 of them, my sister packed up her belongings, what little Mom and Dan allowed her to anyway, and left to live with her then-boyfriend. This left only me and my brother, alone. Stefany leaving like that crushed Mom, too. Prior to that event, I had talked with my Dad about the possibility of moving in to live with him. We had always been close, and my relationship with Dad was much better than with Mom. After Stefany left, I decided I couldn't put Mom through that again, and I was assuring my younger brother, Trevor, that \u201cDan wouldn't run me out of that house like he did to Stefany.\u201d Well, Dan overheard that remark, and, as you could probably guess, he was not pleased. That day, he took out all of his frustrations on me, but, fortunately, it did not get violent. You see, Dan towered over little 14-15 year old me. He was ~6\u20323\u2033, 265 pounds, and strong. I was maybe 5\u20325\u2033 and 115 pounds, and on that night he used every bit of that advantage as he bent me backwards and screamed in my face for hours while Mom just watched and drank her wine. The situation continued to escalate after that night. I started avoiding coming home after school, opting instead to stay at a friend's house as much as possible. I started carrying a pocket knife anytime I knew he wouldn't be at work, just because it gave me a (false) sense of security. That illusion was shattered a few months after my 15th birthday, when Dan decided that my insolence needed to be physically dealt with. He spent that morning just beating the hell out of me. So I too left. I called my Mom, after Dan was safely gone for work, and told her that I was moving in with Dad. The summer of 2008 were some of the best months of my life to date. My Dad bought a double-wide trailer in Tomball, so that I didn't have to transfer schools, and we lived together, just the two of us and his dog. Dad was 65 at the time; was a Vietnam vet who I respected more than anyone before or since; and was retired, so we spent the whole summer together. This was much better than the paltry 4-days per month that the Courts had awarded him after the divorce. During this time, all I ever had to worry about was football and school. I met a girl (who I later married), made friends, and truly enjoyed life. Until November 11, 2008. It's a day that I'll never forget. I didn't feel well when I woke up that morning, so I woke Dad up and asked if I could stay home from school. \u201cNot a problem,\u201d he said, \u201cI'll call the school when I get up in a few hours.\u201d So I texted my girlfriend to tell her happy birthday and explain that I wouldn't be at school, and then I went back to bed. I shot out of bed just a couple of hours later and ran to the bathroom to puke, but when I got in there, Dad was already doing the same. It was around 9AM, and I knew what I needed to do right then. You see, Dad was a Type-1 Diabetic (insulin-dependent). His getting the stomach flu could be life-threatening because it would cause his blood sugar to plummet in a way that his body couldn't regulate. Additionally, the poor circulation to his extremities, associated with his condition, made vessel constriction from dehydration a real fear. I should have stopped right at that moment and called 9-1-1, and I knew it. I knew it. My Mom had explained the dangers of him getting a stomach virus to me before, and I was taking multiple Health Science courses that explained the disease. I knew he needed medical attention before something awful happened. Every single thing I typed here went through my head when I saw him over that toilet, but I did nothing. I just puked on the floor and sulked off to my room feeling sorry for myself because \u201cmy tummy hurt.\u201d It was 5 more hours before an ambulance was called, and only after he had collapsed on his way to the bathroom because his legs wouldn't work from lack of circulation. We got to the Emergency Room at Tomball Regional Medical Center, and they rushed him into a room. The doctors provided him with narcotics for the leg pain he was experiencing, but they missed the larger circulatory problems that were causing it. Dad developed gangrene and had both legs amputated at the VA hospital shortly after we were admitted. Still, his spirits were high, even if it was only a show for me. That is, until the infection set in. Ultimately, Dad died less than one month later on December 8, just a couple of weeks after spending his 66th birthday in a hospital bed. At that point, he was being kept alive entirely by machines. His liver had failed, the infection was spreading, and they had amputated everything up to his pelvis trying to stop it. There was nothing they could do.  My self-pity and inaction killed my own Dad, and it is something that I carry with me to this day. Yes, I know that you can twist the words to argue that I wasn't responsible for his death; many school counselors, Army chaplains, and a psychologist have all done that, but the simple fact remains that I am culpable. I knew what needed to be done to stop that from happening, and I chose not to do what I knew needed to be done. If I had called 5 hours earlier, and they got him on an IV before the tissue started to die, he might well still be alive today. But he isn't, because I didn't. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, though I'm doubtful anyone on here would be inclined to believe me. I was 14 when it happened and it was a home break in. My parents left the house to go to the Casino, which is a normal thing for them about once a week. I was in my room taking a nap and I heard a noise in my parents master bedroom which was a little ways down from my room. It sounded like a door slammed shut. I grabbed a large bowie knife that I had under my bed and four shuriken, yeah I'm a nerd and I still buy these things online and yes, my parents were fine with it. I honestly didn't think anyone was actually in the house, so I casually strolled in the room and saw things thrown around, specifically a jewelery box. It didn't look normal, it didn't look like the wind blew anything. It was thrown and I heard more noises in the bathroom, which thankfully was quite large so it took the culprit time to go through. I didn't proceed any further, instead what I did was I closed the door to the master bedroom and blocked it with a chair so you couldn't open the door. I then proceeded to call the police and told them in a very calm manner that there are people in my house and they broke in and that they had weapons (they apparently didn't have any weapons but I thought it would be smarter to tell the police that so that they would rush over faster, also I didn't know at the time so it was kind of a guess.) Now, like an idiot I was talking on the phone and yelling to the bedroom \u201cI called the police, they will be here soon!!\u201d I thought that would deter the person that broke in. (Bad idea when you are fourteen and you still sound like a little kid\u2026) It did not, instead the guy tried to open the door and couldn't so he took about two or three minutes bashing the door open. While he was doing that I was still on the phone with the police, or the operator actually. She was telling me to hide and not to try anything so I followed her instructions. I went in the living room and hid behind the couch. The man who broke into the house finally bashed through the door and went into the kitched and grabbed a knife and entered the living room. I was very calm until I saw him with a weapon, at fourteen that scared the hell out of me. The police still weren't close, couldn't even hear the sirens yet. The man who broke in was yelling and telling me to come out. I chose not too. Instead I stayed hidden behind the couch and watched him through a little side corner thing. I watched him go back through the kitchen and to the master bedroom. This is when it all happened\u2026I could have left him alone and just waited for the police but instead I did something stupid. I quietly got out from behind the couch and watched him go into my parents bedroom. I snuck behind him all the way there and knifed him through the back. I did it with all my force and it ended up piercing through and through. He fell over and was trying to get up on his knees sort of, at that age I thought he was still okay and that he could still move and was going to pull a gun on me or something (keep in mind I still didn't know if he had a weapon other than the knife he took.) I ran half way into the hallway and through my shuriken at him. Two of them hit him, one in the throat and the other in the stomach region. I watched him bleed out on the floor and I remember it all pretty vividly. By the time the police arrived the guy who broke into the house had been dead for probably five or six minutes. The police were so slow, I have mad respect for them but I remember that when they arrived they took their time. They knocked on the door asked if anyone was home, etc. If I didn't kill the guy, chances are he might've found me and killed me or worse. I never tell anyone this story because no one believes it half the time, due to the shuriken being utilized, I guess. Anyway this led to years and years of councilor\u2019s and psychiatrists, etc. Due to me taking a life at such a young age and feeling totally fine with it. I stopped with the shrinks at the age of 17 because I'm fine. I felt nothing when I killed the guy who broke in because I knew that it was him or me, that's all I've ever felt about the incident. I viewed it as evil versus good, I guess. That was my way of rationalizing what I did. To be honest, there is probably something wrong with me. Maybe something is tweaked but I'm okay with it because I know that I can excel through things like this with little to no remorse because of the way I view it in my mind. Anyway that's my story\u2026I was going to post anonymous but whatever. Not important enough to be anonymous. Peace ",
