            "answer_text": "I hope, you are speaking about self-publishing. Well, in that context, the amount varies from one publisher to the other. Generally, it is anything between 25k to 100k. Few of the publishers that gives you the option of self-publishing are Partridge Publishing | Indian Book Publisher, Self Publishing in India etc. Traditional publishing doesn\u2019t demand anything from the authors, instead they are paid. But, it is really difficult publish books through traditional publishing. With an acceptance rate of only 10%, only few lucky individual can reap benefits from it. Some of the renowned traditional publishers are Penguin India, Harper Collins, McMillan India, etc. There is another way as well, wherein you can publish free of cost. That platform is Amazon. Go to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing to get more details. And if you have your book ready, which is rejected by publishers, go ahead publish it through Amazon. I\u2019ve done this, so I can affirm that it is rewarding. Best of luck! Cheers! ",
