            "answer_text": "This is a great question to ask yourself when you\u2019re developing a work rather than writing it. In fact it\u2019s imperative to consider plot and characters prior to starting chapter one. Some writers seem to \u2018get away\u2019 with writing right after they get that first spark of inspiration that gets us going, but the stories tend to be weaker than they would have been had the author done some basic planning. I know from personal experience! I did very little planning when I started writing. As I gain experience, I\u2019ve found that not only has writing become more satisfying, but that readers appreciate the extra effort and respond well to strong structure, even when they\u2019re not aware of what it is that\u2019s making them happy. Not that I recommend outlining. (Shudder.) But figuring stuff out, whether you use an outline (I\u2019m envious if you\u2019re able to do that well!) or sticky notes or a spiral notebook or just keep it all in a massive mind map (I hate you big brain people just a little bit, LOL), is super-important. Over and over again I see writers with strong prose and great story instincts do \u2018okay\u2019 writing from the seat of their pants with no real plan, and do better or even great (one became a USA Today Bestseller!) after they sat down and seriously thought their stories through. You are missing a couple of pieces, though, namely setting and theme. One of the pain-in -the-butt things about writing by the seat of the pants with no plan is that often you have to write half a book or even the whole book before you figure out what the point of all those words mean. That\u2019s not a happy experience, especially if you realize you have to go back and change things or even rewrite most of it to make it work. Those that think oh, no one will notice or care, I\u2019ll just tweak a couple of sentences here and there and it\u2019ll be fine, they are underestimating the reader. That\u2019s not nice, and it\u2019s not professional, and often it\u2019s plain wrong. There are all kinds of \u2018bad\u2019 books out there with poor prose and corny situations that sell well because the authors laid down good bones: plot, character, setting, and theme. You don\u2019t balance these things so much as develop them. Like a gardener you plant the seeds and then pay attention to them. Give them fertilizer, make sure you weed around them, water them so they don\u2019t dry out, keep the bugs off of them, and prune them if necessary. Develop your characters. Know what they want, and what they need. What\u2019s their internal conflict? How does it relate to the external conflicts (plot)? Do they have secrets? What can you do with the plot to shape (aka torture) your characters and force them to grab what they need (or get them to fail and/or betray themselves for that neato downer ending?) Does your plot repeat itself? Does your plot force the characters to reveal a secret, or reveal a terrible (or glorious) truth? Can your story happen anywhere? I hope not because the setting should be integrated into the plot such that the plot couldn\u2019t happen anywhere else, and the characters should be a part of that setting such that if you transported them to a new place, they wouldn\u2019t fit in and would have to change and adapt to survive. And what\u2019s the point anyway? Does love conquer all? Do you force your readers to face death, or loss, and see it in a new way? Will you contrast the wisdom and grace that can come with age with the cynicism and disability that might also come with age? Will you reveal a cancer in society, or inspire readers to create great works of art? So, think about all that before you start, and remember. It\u2019s not about balance. It\u2019s about fully developing your story, or at least developing it enough that you can get off to a good start. It may morph on you in the telling, but that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not building a foundation. You\u2019re working with clay, and clay is malleable right up until that final draft. I hope that answers your question! ",

            "answer_text": "Some literary novels are character-driven rather than plot-driven. All beach reads are plot-driven (though obviously even beach reads have characters). The question is a legitimate one, not a no-brainer. What arguments can be made in favor of character-driven novels, and what arguments are there in favor of plot-driven novels? A classic example of a character-driven novel would be Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary: Sure, it does have a plot, but that plot is either background or foreground but not the meat of the novel\u2014which is a character study of a 19th-century bourgeois French woman, for whom adultery is the only self-determined thing her culture seems to let her do. Or take two living American novelists\u2014Philip Roth and Pete Dexter. In most of their novels, they reveal the outcome of the plot in the very first chapter. Roth even often begins a chapter with the outcome of that chapter. Theirs are hardly plot-driven novels. Vladimir Nabokov argued in his lectures at Cornell that suspense and mystery novels were seldom worth reading, because once you knew how they ended, there was little pleasure to be had in re-reading them. Nabokov argued that the only novels worth reading are those you appreciate all the more in subsequent readings. His own most famous novel, Lolita, was absolutely character-driven. Nabokov\u2019s Cornell lectures are very instructive: Amazon.com: Lectures on Literature (9780156027755): Vladimir Nabokov, Fredson Bowers, John Updike: Books https://www.amazon.com/dp/0156027763/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stvp_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3171424582&pd_rd_wg=SsIVy&pf_rd_r=J7NK875ER1TM2JBQBZBQ&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-bottom-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=0156027763&pd_rd_w=iXxhM&pf_rd_i=vladimir+nabokov&pd_rd_r=JTPFKXT6C4ZPC17HNWW1&ie=UTF8&qid=1506889001&sr=1 ",
