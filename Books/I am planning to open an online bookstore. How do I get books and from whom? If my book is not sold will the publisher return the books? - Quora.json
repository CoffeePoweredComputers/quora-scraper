Distri. Your direct billing won't happen with publisher. Even if you will send the POs to publisher the order consignment will be sent to distributor with your reference some also do 'bill to distri. Ship to you'  + edit: about returns , mainly you get stocks on SOR basis on direct accounting with publishers only (& in that too majorly trade books are accepted in SOR; non trade publishers might not easily do it) There are many ways to get stock.
