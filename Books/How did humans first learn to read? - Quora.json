            "answer_text": "First we must have come up with a primal sign language and then, depending on the further need to communicate better, we might have come up verbal sign language or simply called languages. Next in line must have been writing down the various visual signals on the ground, walls, leaves of trees, and then next, a broken yet effective way to sequentiliaze those written symbols, starting with words that made sounds while being communicated with each other. And then generations and generations spent on perfecting those sounds, coming up with regional words, letters that must have spread across and away from the area of origin ! Note that this process has of course taken a lot of time to be in the form that we see today. For example, Chimpanzees can communicate with each other and humans too, when they are taught sign languages, and we're just like them, only advanced when it comes to our brain that has evolved so much, and the only difference between us and the chimps is that unlike them, (most probably) we taught ourselves those languages. Note: Just an assumption here and I do not claim to be an expert on any matter related to history or languages, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "The most common consensus among archaeologists is the Bulla Hypothesis. Around 8000BC, Sumerians began rolling clay tokens between their palms to represent goods like wheat, barley, cattle and so on. They used these to keep track of, most likely taxes. The cultivation of wheat which yields 4 million calories per acre/ 0.4 hectares, really enabled petty kings of city-states to finance whatever political scheme they had cooked up. So the farmers, loaded their donkeys, herders goaded their animals and brought their produce to the nearest troop barracks or temple which had granaries.  The scribe would roll uniquely shaped tokens for the taxes paid. In essence the tokens (which evolved into the written word) simply provided proof of payment of taxes. Furthermore the tokens were also used as an early iteration of representative currency.  However some wise guy would alter the tokens into something more valuable and try to redeem them. So the tokens were enclosed in a bulla, which is a hollow spherical envelope. Then scribe rolled his seal.  Later the bulla would need to be broken in order to settle disputes. So to keep the bulla intact. The tokens were pressed onto the wet clay before it hardened. Later somebody used a sharpened stick instead of pressing the tokens. One end was shaped into a round dowel. To represent some large number. This became a fully developed writing system called Mesopotamian cuneiform by c.3200BC.   Later some scribe impressed a wedge shaped stick instead of \u201cdrawing\u201d the commodities. The images became even more abstract.    Finally they used only the wedge shaped end for all their symbols.  Bulla (seal) - Wikipedia Representative money - Wikipedia Cuneiform - Wikipedia  ",
