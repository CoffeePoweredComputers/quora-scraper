            "answer_text": "The three golden things to do- Read, Write and Speak a lot. I mean to say read paper/magazine/blogs/Quora/Post a lot...and when your eyes starts itching then read again and take your revenge...read billboard/read road posters/read bus,auto posters/read just read soon you will find that you are able to learn a lot new words and now you are able to distinguish between correct words and wrong words.Take words as a picture/image, more the images you see more you will remember. So just explore more.Use extensions in chrome [any dictionary], use auto spelling check in MS word.Keep a pocket dictionary with you ...always. And when doubt arises for any word then just check and correct on spot. Now lets move to Speaking part.As till now you have read a lot [I assume] and probably gain some knowledge .But it's of very less benefit if you not utilize in your general speaking.Use that word in your sentence and whenever you use it just spell that word in your mind[you can murmur also]...and woahh!!!..you are now one less word that is mistake free. Come on man , just try it. I know we all do a lot of reading[again I assume] and many do speaking also but the thing that we forget to do is the Writing part.Guys there is a writer hidden in each of us,believe me and start writing whatever you have done in your entire day in one diary or start a blog writing and keep on checking the errors you performed while writing and correct those on spot [as in writing in MS word of in internet a red line will appear showing a spelling mistake ,we usually right click-->correct-->move on but we seldom try to memorize or remember our mistake thinking \"Auto correct hain na\"[auto correct is already there] and just procrastinate this small part of learning. P.S- You can also write the mistaken words in a chit[piece of paper] and keep it in your pocket so that whenever you see it you get your mistake. I hope the answer helps.Note - Sorry for my English, you know I am also learning.  :-) ",
