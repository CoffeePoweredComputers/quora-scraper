            "answer_text": "Familiarize with potential publications. It is important to be aware of the research already published and the current questions and studies in your field. Pay special attention to how other research papers are written: the format, the type of articles (quantitative studies versus qualitative ones, primary research, review of existing papers), the writing style, the subject matter, and the vocabulary.Read academic journals related to your field of study.Search online for published research papers, conference papers, and journal articles.Ask a colleague or professor for a suggested reading list.Choose the publication that suits your research paper. Each publication has its own audience and tone of writing. Decide if your research paper would fit better in a journal that is highly technical and meant only for other scholars or a journal that is more general in nature that would appeal to a broader audience.Format your research paper so it fits the guidelines for that publication. Most journals provide a document called \"Instruction to Authors\" or \"Author's Guide\" that offers specific instructions about layout, type font, and length. This guide will also tell you how to submit your paper and will provide details of the review process.Ask a colleague and/or professor to review your research paper. They should edit your paper for grammar, spelling errors, typos, clarity, and conciseness. At this time, they should also verify your content. Research papers need to present an issue that is significant and relevant. They should be clearly written, easy to follow, and appropriate for the intended audience. Have two or three people review your paper, more if possible.Revise. It is likely you will go through three or four drafts before final submission of your research paper. Make a special effort to make your paper clear, engaging, and easy to follow. This will greatly increase your chances of being published.Submit your article. Go back to the Author's Guide to review submission requirements. Once you are satisfied that your paper meets all of the guidelines, submit the paper through the appropriate channels. Some journals allow online submission, while others prefer a hard copy.Keep trying. Many a times journals will ask you to revise your paper and resubmit. Study their critiques carefully and make the necessary changes. Do not get over-attached to your original submission. Instead, remain flexible and rework the paper in light of the feedback you received. Use all of your skills as a researcher and a writer to create a superior paper. Even if you are ultimately rejected by your \"target\" publication, continue to re-write your research paper and submit it to other publications.Source:http://www.wikihow.com/Publish-a-Research-Paper ",

Otherwise it may be waste of time and will be frustrating to receive a negative response.Journal prestige is less significant, select a journal where your paper will have the highest impact, draft your paper keeping readers in mind.When you \u201cdecide who are your readers\u201d, write accordingly. This decision will help you to determine the correct journal, your writing style, and also the structure and contents of your paper.To your submission \u201cAdd a clear cover letter\u201d, summarizing the results and conclusions of your research work. This will help the editor to decide on your manuscript fits the scope of the journal or not saving the timeCheck the \u201cAuthor Guidelines\u201d before submitting to the journalWriting is an art. Go for \u201cproofread your manuscript\u201d with your colleagues or seniors. Else, because of poor style and English exceptional papers are rejectedDo \u201cacknowledge\u201d all your co-authors and fellow researchersAlways mention if any \u201cSource of funding\u201d is there for your paperDon\u2019ts: Take your own time picking the appropriate journal. It\u2019s \u201cPublishing ethics\u201d not to submit your manuscript to random journals or to as many journals at same time. Few journals have blacklisted such authors.Don\u2019t argue with an editor or reviewer over their decision. If you do, do in a respectful and professional manner. Avoid unfair attacks on referee or editorsDon\u2019t disregard editor or reviewer\u2019s comments without explaining \u201cwhy\u201d. This will be inclined towards rejection of your paperNever rush for your article submission or revisionCheck out Plagiarism and also avoid Self-plagiarism (using own previously published work without attributing it)Just to get feedback don\u2019t submit incomplete paperDon\u2019t include in statements about your reputation (sentences like do you know who am I) or publication record or celebrity endorsementsDon\u2019t make general statement about significance of your research field indicating towards other published papers or on expected citationsDon\u2019t oversell or rewrite your resultsA long literature review is not usually appreciated as readers skip reading it",

            "answer_text": "Some cheap-Charlie universities pull that one. Once you have graduated they will not give you any financial support for publishing the work. There is a simple remedy. Just put where you did the work in the Acknowledgements (which nobody ever reads) and use the address of another institution as your official address for authorship on the title page. For example, you could ask your undergraduate university to give you honorary status and you use their address as your official address. I did that to the University of Western Sydney when my contract lectureship ran out. I told them I had manuscripts in preparation and asked them to give me honorary associate status. The Dean refused. I went to my Alumni (Sydney) and made the same offer. They took it and got their address on my papers. If you have a job somewhere use that as your institutional address. The effect is that the university then gets no credit or money for the publication. It hits their hip-pocket nerve. If they want to behave like arseholes treat them as arseholes. ",
