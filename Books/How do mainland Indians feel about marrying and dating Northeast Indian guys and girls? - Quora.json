            "answer_text": "Glad you asked! I\u2019m a Parsi chick from Delhi and my guy is Axomiya and so far, I\u2019m LOVIN\u2019 IT!! Guys from Northeast are VERY loving and understanding (he still gets unreasonable when we fight, lol). Oh yeah, I forgot to add that he can throw tantrums too over the stupidest and tiniest things possible sometimes. (All that sass \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f from 1 guy..) We fight in 3 different languages and it\u2019s always miraculously my fault but he\u2019s the humbler one to apologise (girl benefits, hehehehhehe). (Baad mein Taana marega 100%) Now coming back to the point, Guys from Northeast are transparent with their feelings and have a big heart! Also, be prepared to eat alot of healthy food and say goodbye to tasty-tasty fried food if you ever decide to date a Northeastern guy\ud83d\ude2d.. In Parsi Families, we tend to be very open and proud about the guy we are dating and often tell our parents.\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But it\u2019s a little different on the eastern side. It\u2019s like, you\u2019ll have to win his parents over eventually because he won\u2019t be able to tell them himself ( it can be too much responsibility for the girl sometimes). But he\u2019s gonna be super supportive of your career and he is never gonna hold you back. Guys from northeast lend a hand while taking care of the household\ud83d\udc40 (As a girl, it secretly turns me on). And don\u2019t go with the stereotype that if he\u2019s from northeast, his English is gonna be good. IT\u2019S NOT TRUE! My guy would happily butcher Keats\ud83d\ude02. Guys from Northeast excel at atleast 1 sport and he would lovingly beat you at it. He\u2019s gonna be super possessive and you might have to make minor tweaks in your style. Arre haa! Start practicing to make more tea! 1 cup isn\u2019t gonna be enough. Even though he may appear shy and introverted in the beginning, when your northeastern lover will start speaking, he will speak non-stop for 2 hours. Raat ko sone nahi dega..trust me.. And his Hugs are gonna be super warm.. You\u2019ll start craving him all the time.. Oh haa! I forgot to add! Be ready to meet his relatives and remember all the name because Guys from Northeast have strong Family Values and needless to say they have strong paternal instincts. So he\u2019s very protective of those who need help. Aur yeh mat sochna ki Northeast ka hai toh Boht Seedha hai and ek baar mein baat maan lega.. Na Na Na..you\u2019ll still have to tell him a hundred times to wear a thicker sweater till he finally catches cold.. (fir dawa ke liye bhi inke 100 nakhre) Also, be ready to travel because if your guy is from one northeastern state, he\u2019s gonna take you to every single northeastern state. And buy a scarf. He\u2019ll cover you with hickies\u2026everywhere\u2026. Appearance wise people from Northeast are better looking than northwesterners. They have a clear skin that is so soft and supple\u2026 just like a baby.. meanwhile my (typical mainlander) skin is like an underpaid miner *cries in whale noises*. You\u2019ll have to work your ASS OFF in keeping up with his good looks. (I lucked out!!!) His skin is gonna feel like Satin and his hair like Silk. Height Wise Guys from Northeast can be Surprisingly Tall (in all respects, teehee).. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is too broad, narrow it down like: Do Indians living in major cities like Northeast who live in major cities. Want to understand more? Keep reading.. Because trust me, these young NE boys and girls coming to major cities like Delhi or Mumbai for studies or jobs have a whole new different lifestyle which we don\u2019t follow back home in front of parents. Many get spoiled coming to cities away from parents (not all) many succeed in life too. So next time you meet a fellow NE, don\u2019t judge just cos you fought last night with your NE neighbor who was partying the whole night lol. Coming to your answer I\u2019ve stayed in Mumbai and Delhi for 10+ years(combined) and girls there find me(NE boy) cute and sweet (it\u2019s true). Their expression is differently sweeter when they are around you because I look exotic (don\u2019t mistake those people who like to keep exotic looking friends lol). They are interested in you but again they are also confused whether to make you a soulmate as there might be a cultural clash which I think there isn\u2019t so much of difference unless you build the connection. They smile more when talking to you (imitating my cute smile? hmm **\ud83d\ude09**) except to those racist bastards who like to pick on you and discriminate you just to put himself to a little higher ground cos maybe he already knows his level is as low as shit underneath the ground \ud83d\ude1c. City live, money talks (hard truth). Many will say money is not everything, character is key blah blah. Trust me it\u2019s all bullshit (don\u2019t mind my word, just being honestly blunt). You can clearly see when these girls want to mingle with you because they have the city life approach, they don\u2019t wait for tomorrow. Is she showing interest? don\u2019t wait, go for it as you know there are other thousand hungry alphas like you ready to hit on her. And don\u2019t even think she will wait for you, cos she feels you are not interested and she moves on. And trust me she move on quickly, watch next time you see her, dude! it\u2019s too late , she got a bf. City life is fast like a one night stand, you like it u hold on to it, you don\u2019t like - tata bye bye. Simple as that. NE boy look small , but it\u2019s a trait. I found out my smaller body can walk and climb longer distances which tells a lot about hilly areas and how to be swift and handy, as you need to stay light with strong arms ( you\u2019ll only know how strong NE are only after playing arm wrestling) Most important - northeast men don\u2019t fake around, we like to stay as what we are (except the fashion sense which I feel is overloaded cos you\u2019ll find young girls wearing heels and boys with the latest hairstyle or jeans even in the most hilly remote village **\ud83d\ude09* You\u2019ll find girls wearing 3 inch heels walking down the dustiest road and wettest road full of potholes, fashion just follows you everywhere, fashion loves NE so much and just won\u2019t leave them alone even in the most remote part of the country. We also don\u2019t talk shit like \u201cI have this much money or that much money\u201d which of course could be a turn down for some materialistic bitches. NE approach to others may look less confident in few people\u2019s eyes partly cos we aren\u2019t raised from a busy city life where kids in cities only care about what they have and think of their own benefit most of the time. NE people have this strong community bonding which is like your own family bonding. That\u2019s why NE love their own bubble where people respect and understand each other. Less population makes NE people different on how we approach one another, we are not scared, we just don\u2019t response and react the way Indians in major cities do. People are different everywhere, even NE people living in major cities are different from other NE living in North East. Oh one thing! Not to demoralize any ethnicity or group, but remember Northeast girls are not from Thailand! The cheapest holiday destination most Indian could ever afford, followed by our cheap mentality of our fellow Indian fuckboys. I\u2019m also not saying Thai girls are bad, but again we NE don\u2019t follow the same morality like in Thailand just because we look more Thai than you \ud83d\ude1c. Thank again. ",
