            "answer_text": "JEE content is at a higher level as compared to NEET level, in terms of physics and chemistry. Over the years it has been noticed that the past questions of JEE have been repeated in NEET, as higher level questions. Though these questions are relatively scarce. And if you develop a relatively higher acumen in physics and chemistry as compared to other NEET students, you can do slightly better in them. Therefore, you can. But you should know where to draw the line. Good tuitions teach everything necessary for NEET, and enough of JEE, to do well in physics. I had the same experience, that\u2019s why I never felt the need of watching any sort of lectures.If you don\u2019t feel that your tuition has taught you enough regarding these subjects, and/or you\u2019ve already got your concepts covered in these subjects, then for sure you can go ahead and view such lectures. 2. Not everything that\u2019s taught in JEE will come in NEET. How can you know what to go for on a JEE level? a. Look at previous year papers/chapterwise questions of NEET: Check out the topics in which a higher level of questions are being posed very frequently. b. Analyze weightage: \u2018Go the extra mile\u2019 in the topics which have higher weightage, first. c. Consult your teachers if you can: Undoubtedly, the available JEE lectures can be helpful, but they can\u2019t tell you what specific type of questions or parts to target, that can be asked in NEET. A physics teacher who has observed the trends over the years, can. Therefore ask them, in an active class or doubt sessions, to teach you expected/targeted portions of JEE, that can show up in NEET. CONCLUDING TIP - Its very common among aspirants to get the hang of a topic, understand concepts really well and then get addicted to solving its questions. I sincerely advise you to not become over-attached to the topic and its higher level concepts and then go on solving the unnecessary higher level questions that\u2019ll be pure JEE, and probably have 0 to minimum chance to show up in NEET. Only do that much that\u2019s sufficient. Know where to put the brakes. A lot of physics and chemistry fans, make this mistake and end up wasting lots of time. Remember, physics and chemistry, combined, carry a weightage equivalent to that of biology, therefore ignoring biology in lust of a few additional marks, can hurt you. All the best! ",
