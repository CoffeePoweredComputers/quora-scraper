            "answer_text": "When I finished the first draft of my book, I had it reviewed by a professional editor. One of the comments she made was, that for character development, it was better to show rather than to tell. Show by words, actions, thoughts of the characters  rather than saying He/she was sad/smart/quick witted etc.That leads to higher engagement with the readers who form their own views of the characters. That means that every interpretation is different based on the readers reference. So in my view, the more engaging the book in showing rather than telling, the more the variations in perceptions. ",
