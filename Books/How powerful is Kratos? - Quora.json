            "answer_text": "Short answer: Too powerful to comprehend. Longer answer: Kratos was born a demigod, which instantly makes him somewhat powerful. However, he was the son of Zeus. Demigods born from the Big Three (Poseidon, Hades and Zeus) are more powerful than other demigods. It\u2019s fairly logical to consider Kratos stronger than Thor already as Thor is the son of Odin. Odin is arguably weaker than Zeus as Zeus is a true immortal. Fast forward to God of War 1 and Kratos has already started a quest to dethrone a god. He chopped off Medusa\u2019s head and used it as a weapon and he fought his way to Pandora\u2019s Box. Don\u2019t forget the powers the other gods bestowed upon him too (Zeus gave him the ability to throw lightning bolts etc.). Kratos is then killed by a massive spear thrown by Ares. He dies. He fights his way out of the underworld and escapes death for the first time. This is basically the game\u2019s way of telling us that Kratos cannot be killed. Kratos opens Pandora\u2019s Box and gains the power of Hope, which puts him on par with most superheroes across universes. He then kills Ares, who is a god and takes his place as the God of War. Then God of War 2 happens. Kratos gets tricked by Zeus into draining his power into a divine weapon forged from the Heavens and the Earth by Zeus himself, the Blade of Olympus. Zeus picks up this blade and stabs Kratos through the heart with it. Kratos gets sent to the underworld. He comes back and sides with the Titans. He encounters Prometheus and frees him. Prometheus\u2019 ashes are absorbed by Kratos who gains the power of Rage, which Kratos is now known for. He gets many relics on his journey like the Amulet of the Sisters of Fate (which allows him to slow down time at will) and the Golden Fleece (he can now deflect any projectiles or beams). He goes on to slay the Sisters of Fate (who control the destiny of every living thing) and gains the power of time travel. He time travels to when Zeus \u201ckilled\u201d him and interferes. He steals the Blade of Olympus from Zeus and uses it to fight him. It\u2019s important to know that the Blade of Olympus was the deciding factor in this fight as it was forged by Zeus which means it can control lightning and had absorbed Kratos\u2019 former godly power which meant it could destroy armies in one swing. Think of it as Thor\u2019s Stormbreaker, except it can kill immortal gods and it looks cooler.  So Kratos pretends to give up and hands over the Blade to Zeus. God of War 2 : Ending Kratos try to Kill Zeus! 720p [HD] Kratos would\u2019ve killed Zeus right then and there. So Kratos kills Hades and absorbs his soul which makes Kratos God of the Underworld and makes him truly immortal. He then escaped from the Underworld again. He snaps Poseidon\u2019s neck and gouges out his eyes. He rips Helios\u2019 head off and uses it as a weapon, so he can now blind people. He rips Hermes\u2019 legs off just to steal his boots. He can now move faster than sound. He rips Icarus\u2019 wings straight off him so he can fly. He stole Hades\u2019 claws so he can steal souls. He impaled Zeus with the Blade of Olympus. Zeus came back in his astral form, so he beat him up with his bare hands. Verdict: Kratos is insanely powerful. He\u2019s strong enough to flip entire temples. He can move at the speed of sound and slow time at will. He also is immortal and his rage heals him from any injuries. He can fly. He is experienced in magic and has numerous relics like the Head of Medusa. He can also shoot projectiles which instantly kill from the Blade of Olympus. So without the Blade Kratos is stronger than most characters but wielding that Blade seals the deal.  ",

            "answer_text": "As a big fan of God of War, Kratos is honestly one of my favorite video game characters of all time.  I am sorry, but if I were to choose who I would not choose to piss off, from MCU Thanos or Kratos, I would rather piss off MCU Thanos. Brief reason on why I like Kratos: His Character Development In his first trilogy, he was a good character because his reasoning for hating the Gods made sense (he served under Ares after Ares saved him, but Ares influenced Kratos to kill his own family (since Kratos wife and kids liked Athena more than him) and Kratos grew to hate the Gods). He was badass, he killed all the Greek Gods except Aphrodite, but overall I thought he wasn\u2019t a great character. I didn\u2019t think much of Kratos, until I played this game.  Holy cow, this is my top 5 games, and this made Kratos top 5 favorite video game characters. We take Kratos, and dissect him. It turns out that Kratos went from a rampaging unstoppable beast to a man who feels Guilty about his crimes, and wants to make his son a better man than him. We take a Rampaging God who is pretty two-dimensional, into a God who tries to atone his mistakes and be a great, kind man who his son can look up to. Look, Kratos isn\u2019t meant to be sympathized, but the new God of War game broke him down into a character that the audience can understand, as well as being more developed and layered. I may not forgive his actions in the first three God of War, but I understand that he isn\u2019t a heartless monster but just a God who is trying to redeem his mistake and be a better individual. But anyway, Kratos isn\u2019t just a great character because of his history. He\u2019s also a f*cking badass. By the way, the new God of War game is the direct sequel to the Greek God of War. This means new Kratos still has the same feats as the old ones, its just that he isn\u2019t trying or going all out. In the God of War Games, Kronus (the King of Titans (powerful beings stronger than Greek Gods) ) who happened to be 1600 feet tall tried to crush Kratos with his fingers, but Kratos successfully repelled Kronus.     By the way, Kronus is 1600 feet tall, and weighs up to 7 million metric tons. When Kronos tried to slap Kratos, Kratos successfully held the attack, and throw it back. That means Kratos can withstand the impact force of at least 1,648,954,260,000 Newtons. Also, Kronos clap had the force of 164,895,426,000 Newtons. If we calculate to weight, 1 TON is equal to 8896.4432 newton. That makes Kratos lift at least 18,534,983 tons. To people who say that feat makes Kratos \u201cweak\u201d, well no offense but you guys are trolls. If we compare it to comics, then of course it would be weak compared to Comic Thor, Superman, Hulk, etc. But in terms of gamewise and even movies, that is incredibly powerful. I mean seriously, do you think any MCU hero can do that? By the way, Kronos has the comparable strength of Atlas, who is a Primoridial God and holds the sky on his shoulder. Not to mention, Atlas tried to fight Kratos and squish him, but Kratos repelled the attack and held off Atlas.  This is Atlas by the way.  This is Kronos in God of War   Kratos also took a lightning bolt from Zeus (who turned giant) which caused mountains to shatter and break. Kratos took a hit at point blank range, and still survived. Kratos even dodged a lightning bolt from Zeus       Hades, the God of the Underworld, tried to rip Kratos\u2019 soul out of his body. Yet Kratos     Finally, Kratos has killed nearly all of the Greek Pantheon. He killed Ares, Hades, Poseidon, Hephastus, Hercules (the strongest God physically), Thanatos (The God of Death), and Zeus (The King of the Greek Gods, as well as the most powerful Greek God). Even if we took Norse Kratos, he is still a badass.  Kratos managed to defeat Baldur by himself (who has near invulnerability, ice powers as well as can\u2019t feel pain and heals himself). In a pushing match, their battle causes a chasm in a cliff.  Kratos has the Leviathan Axe which was forged by the same dwarves that created Thor\u2019s hammer. The Leviathan Axe can summon blizzards as well as cause immense frost damage, and returns to Kratos\u2019 hand like Mjolnir/Stormbreaker.  Kratos has his Blades of Chaos reforged and fixed to the point it now has Nordic runes, making it have both Greek and Norse magic. Which means the new Blades of Chaos are more powerful.  On the plus side, now the Blades of Chaos has even more explosive magic. It can summon meteors or fireballs from the sky at will.      I mean seriously. Kratos is an awesome character. He\u2019s well-developed, has a likeable personality, and has weapons that can cause meteor showers and blizzards. He killed Gods (especially powerful ones like The God of Death, King of the Gods, God of the Sea and God of the Underworld), dodged lightning near point blank range, took amped up lightning in the face and lived, returned from the dead, and can lift at least 18 billion tons. To say that Kratos is weak is honestly laughable. Kratos is one of the most powerful video game characters of all time. Respect Kratos (God of War series) ",
