            "answer_text": "As children, we are always told to dream big. One must first ask them self however what is their dream. Unfortunately nowadays it is so easy to get sidetracked and lose sight of what really want: the dream The main thing to bear in mind is that it\u2019s not going to be some 10 minute quick fix; instead it\u2019s a large project that requires endurance, patience and determination, much like a marathon. It\u2019s likely not going to be easy, and will most probably tire you to your last breath but keep the finish line in your mind and envision crossing that line. A plan is always a good asset to have to keep you on track and enables you to evaluate your progress, whilst guiding you, like a map. Keep focused and remind yourself why you are living and what you are hoping to accomplish, in which case slowly but surely build towards this by continuing to learn and becoming a better person, shaping yourself to where you want to be(even the small stuff), and you\u2019\u2019ll begin involuntarily edging towards the dream.

            "answer_text": "Take it one step at a time. Break down your dreams into bite-size goals. Even break down those goals into smaller goals, keep going until you start finding yourself with goals you can tackle. Take a step towards your dream regularly, daily if possible. learn to love failure, the lessons you learn from failure are as valuable as the lessons you learn from success, possibly even more so. If procrastination is a problem then research systems that will help you stay focused. Like Pomodoro. On the way to your dream be sure to congratulate yourself for your perseverance above or as much as your successes. It\u2019s a mindset. Surround yourself (even if it\u2019s just your online self) with like-minded and supportive people. Don\u2019t let unexpected obstacles overwhelm you; there is almost always a solution to beat them back down. The feeling of a new obstruction may seem familiar, much like the feeling of the dream that once seemed unreachable. Repeat the goal break down process at any time. Ask for help, there no need to do this all alone. offer help, 3 in 1, solidifying your understanding, building your connections and developing your reputation. Be mindful of your time, simplify your life, cut back on distractions and prioritize your dreams above mindless entertainment. But don\u2019t cut back too far as you may need a mental break from your dream from time to time. Like the above, focus is great but don\u2019t get so focused at the expense of other things going on in your life. Small things that only take up small chunks of daily time can rise up and cause a full weekend catastrophe. Good luck ",
