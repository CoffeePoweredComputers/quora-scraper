            "answer_text": "Sci-fi is an extremely large and varied genre so sweeping generalizations are hard to make. However, here are my personal top 3 books: Ender's Game by Orson Scott CardiRobot by Issac AsimovAnathem by Neal StephensonSci-fi can be broadly divided into two categories 'hard' sci-fi and 'soft' sci-fi. I tend to like 'hard' sci-fi. 'Hard' sci-fi is characterized by a focus on how a civilization will be affected by a technology. For example, in iRobot we are given the technology of robots with human and beyond human level intelligence but required to follow the three laws. All of the stories in iRobot and other hard sci-fi books are built on an internally consistent technological foundation and seek to explore the limits of the technology and how it will impact civilization. \u2018Soft\u2019 sci-fi not really concerned with how a technology works or even what a technology\u2019s limitations are. An example we can look at is Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. In Hitchhiker's Guide we are introduced to countless technologies that are usually unexplained and always vastly under utilized. However, given the point of the book is to tell a wonderful story about a person not a civilization, the reader is happy to just go along with it. This said, most sci-fi books tend to be some mix of \u2018Hard\u2019 and \u2018Soft\u2019 sci-fi elements. Given this here is a list of my favorite \u2018Hard\u2019 sci-fi: Ender's Game by Orson Scott CardiRobot by Issac AsimovAnathem by Neal StephensonThe Fountains of Paradise by Arthur C. ClarkeMars Trilogy by Kim Stanley RobinsonFoundation Trilogy By Issac AsimovDiamond Age by Neil StephensonHyperion by Dan SimmonsThe Mote in God's Eye by Niven & PournelleHere is a list of my favorite \u2018Soft\u2019 sci-fi: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas AdamsDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K DickStarship Troopers by Robert A HeinleinDune by Frank HerbertRingworld by Larry Niven ( I am not a fan but it deserves to be on the list)I hope you have as wonderful a time exploring the vast incredible worlds of Man\u2019s imagination. Sci-Fi is rewarding genre that frees the reader and author to imagine what is possible and requires the discipline to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d. Get inspired and start asking \u201chow?\u201d - Frank ",
