            "answer_text": "It's only worth as much as someone is willing to pay. The news reports of first editions of any book selling for hundreds of thousands are newsworthy because of how rare it is. Someone wanted to pay that much at auction, so they did. It's the same as the new British \u00a35 notes: only one sold at that price. My library at school had a first edition, in English, of Philosopher\u2019s Stone. It won't be worth anything, because countless people had read it. But for me, and the others who recognised it as such, it had worth to them. It was the edition that started their whole Harry Potter journey (for want of a better word), and would do better continuing to be read than held in some glass case by a collector to stare at. Keep it. Read it. Enjoy it. That's what books are for. ",
