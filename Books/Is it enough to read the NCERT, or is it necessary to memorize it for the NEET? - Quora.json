            "answer_text": "This was the very question in my mind before starting my NEET 2019 preparation; to which I have found the answer after the NEET 2019 exam. Many people including your teachers will say that you never had to byheart NCERT but only has to read and understand concepts. But that is not entirely true if you have to score well in NEET at least for BIOLOGY. Literally, you should try to memorize each and every line of NCERT BIOLOGY if possible (read each chapter or topic again and again don't try to memorize line by line). Each word has its specific meaning and is often made a subject for a NEET MCQ. It is not a cakewalk to memorise all NCERT textbooks. So concentrate more in BIOLOGY NCERT then CHEMISTRY and finally PHYSICS( you only need a speed read for Physics; for wasting time reading physics NCERT repeatedly is not a good choice) Anyway, solve as much as conceptual and variety of MCQs as much as possible for all the three subjects. Time management is also a key factor in your success. Thanks for scrolling through my opinion.  :)Neezam Uddin ",

            "answer_text": "NCERT is enough and it's also necessary to learn because it sets the base for NEET preparation so you have to refer those books for NEET. Each and every student refer these book for the preparation so to score high you have to refer other references as well It is important that one starts his/ her preparation with NCERT books and moves towards the reference books in the advanced stages of preparation. NEET preparation must be NCERT-focused and it must always be treated with utmost importance, but it is difficult to get great results if one relies solely on these books. Also, you can find these books with a solution on Toppr website / Application just search on google you will get free PDF for each and every book so just go and check out. I hope my answer will help you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d All the best!! ",
