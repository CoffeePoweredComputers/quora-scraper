            "answer_text": "The answer is dependant upon a number of different factors - but if you\u2019re looking to buy that home in Malibu and spend winter skiing in the Alps, you\u2019ll need a second job (and maybe a Lotto win\u2026). In general, non-fiction writers earn more than writers of fiction, and those average income figures you find online often include technical writers or those who earn a decent living producing copy for commercial organisations. If you are writing fiction, then the average yearly income - for a published author - is around $15,000. But, as I said, that is if you are fortunate enough to land a publisher and get your book into print. Many well-known writers of literary fiction sell no more than 5,000 copies of their book each year, so you can probably deduce from that how much they earn. Of course there are exceptions. We have all read about little-known or first-time authors landing those huge film-rights deals, or getting enormous advances from major publishers. The truth in regard to publishers\u2019 advances has changed somewhat in recent years, however. Publishers are naturally risk-averse, and the easiest way to sign a likely hit is to pick up an author whose books have already sold well - and built a following - as a self-published work on Amazon or a similar platform. Why gamble on someone nobody has heard of when you can sign a deal with an author who has already shifted several-hundred-thousand copies online? My advice is to write for the love of it, and to hone your craft. Finish your work, have it reviewed by people whose opinion you value (and who won\u2019t be too sensitive about your feelings) and then maybe put it up on Amazon to see if it generates any interest. The worst that can happen is that you become a better writer, so if this one doesn\u2019t deliver fame and fortune, your next one might. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on a few things- if you\u2019re being published traditionally or self publishing and if you got an advance. Traditional publishing doesn\u2019t have a great royalty rate - for a print book that can be between 12\u201320% (sometimes these are on a gradient so when you\u2019ve sold over 100,000, you\u2019ll earn a bigger percentage) but if you get an advance that can be in the thousands to tens of thousands. However, advances are becoming more rare and with the growth of digital first publishers they\u2019re not necessary. If you are publishing an ebook you will often find the royalty rate is better. Society of Authors in the uk does a yearly update on earnings. The last one found the average income of an author to be \u00a311,000 a year (that\u2019s down from a few years before when it was around \u00a314,000). Being a debut does sometimes have advantages but most authors are mid list, have been doing this a while and their income varies year to year. You have to keep putting a book out there consistently, along with building a following, promotion etc. If you have an agent, they\u2019ll get 20% of whatever you make, but they can negotiate for foreign rights which can be a great extra source of income that you wouldn\u2019t have without an agent. Similarly, having your book made into an audio book, large print or selling the film/tv rights is another form of income. Being a writer is not an easy way to make money and many of us find its easier to have a day job too so that you\u2019re not depending on your art to make money. Everyone hears the stories about the hundred thousand pound advances but when you think about how many authors are working today, they\u2019re one in a million. This isn\u2019t meant to put you off, just to help you be realistic if embarking on a new path. ",
