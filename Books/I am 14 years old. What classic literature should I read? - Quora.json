            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A David Kvitaishvili! =) To be honest I think our tastes might be too different for me to give any really great recommendations. The closest things I could recommend are books you're probably already familiar with. Imre Kertesz - \"Fatelessness\"Douglas Adams - \"The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\"J.D Salinger - \"Catcher in the Rye\"E.M Forster - \"A Room with a View\" I suggest you go to Goodreads, put together a list of the books you've read and then you'll get some suggestions based on them on the right hand side. I've added 200+ great books based on my initial list of 50 great books. It's a great tool and interacting with other readers who share your interests is super easy. Have an awesome & creative day! =) ",
