            "answer_text": "Just make sure that your company is officially registered.  As long as you have a legal business entity, then you can sell that to anyone else, regardless of whether the space it is in is rented or not.  Just keep in mind that, if you do sell it, it needs to be attractive enough for people to want to buy it.  So, for example, renting a space that is not good for expansion, so a new owner would possibly have to pay additional costs to move it.  Or renting a space that will only be available for a shorter period (one or two years), with no long-term guarantees. If you're going into this with plans of selling it later, the problem isn't one of \"if it can be sold\".  If you're properly registered as a business, that's not a problem.  What you should be focusing on is creating a condition that is going to make it ideally attractive to whoever you want to sell it to.  In particular, that it not only is a solid business, but that it is one they can easily grow.  Look at all the decisions you make now in that light. ",

            "answer_text": "Appreciate the A2A.  You sell a business by going out on top. You will need Detailed and up to date financials. Your lease agreement and any options on it. Current tax information and filings. Hopefully you are operating as an entity and not a sole proprietorship. Your lease probably includes a right for the landlord to oppose. Make sure the landlord is on board with the change in ownership and be aware of any personal guarantees you might have made for payment of the space. If the new ownership craters your shop you could still be on the hook for money. Have a purchase agreement drawn up showing what is actually being bought Cash on handInventory only?Debt?LeaseFurniture and fixtures, etc.Be aware that selling a business is not like selling a house. It is unlikely someone will buy it and you should really have a plan to wind it down when you are done. ",
