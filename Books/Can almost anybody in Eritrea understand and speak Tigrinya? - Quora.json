            "answer_text": "I like the word almost because not all of us can speak tigrinya but most of us can understand it. There are 9 ethnic groups in Eritrea. They all have different languages. As tigrinya is the official language almost all they can understand and speak but like kunama, Afar, hdarb, like those ethnic groups who live far from tigrinya speakers so it's hard for them to speak in tigrigna but almost all the people can understand it. Rashaida: Most recent tribe to come to Eritrea from the Arabian Peninsula. They are predominantly nomadic people who live along the Northern Red Sea coast. They are Muslim. Kunama : They are mainly found in villages between the Gash River and in Barentu. They are Nilotic and renowned dancers having developed more than 25 different dancing forms. They are mainly Christians and Muslims with some traditional believers. Hidarb: Cushtic Beja (T\u2019bdawie) semi nomadic pastoralists specializing in raising camels and cattle. They are found in the western lowlands. it's hard sometimes to find tigrinya speakers among those ethnic groups who lives far from tigrinya speakers, although most people can understand it. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer you in short yes But although most of the population can understand Tigrinya about 95% only about 80% could speak fluently, you ask how and why on the next paragraph Eritrea a country in East Africa, with a population of 5.5 million has 9 Ethnic groups as in 9 languages, with each ethnic group its own language only 2 has used it own alphabets which are tigrayit language of the Tigre Ethnic group moslty living in the lowlands and Tigrigna language of the tigrnya people mostly living In the highlands. With Tigre and Tigrigna people amounting to about 85% of the population, 30% & 55% respectively, they are considered the most influential in the country. And both languages (tigrayit and Tigrigna) are close related which they descent from the ancient language of Geez, by that tigrnya speakers could easily understand tigrayit speakers and vice versa. I hope you got your answer to your question ",

So, the answer is almost, yes. \u201c\u12f3\u122d\u130b \u1218\u1265\u12db\u1215\u1275\u1293\u201d That past line is Tigrinya that translates to, \u201calmost all of us\u201d, by the way. Tigrinya has been a lingua franca ever since Eritrea\u2019s independence, alongside Arabic and English. Eritrea has 9 languages, namely Tigrinya, Tigre, Kunama, Nara, B\u2019daweet(Hdarb), Blin, Afar, Saho and Arabic. Not only that, Tigrinya originates from an ancient language called Geez, which gave rise to Tigrinya and Tigre - and Amharic, a language spoken in Ethiopia. The foremost two languages\u2014Tigrinya and Tigre are the largest languages in terms of number of native speakers in Eritrea and are about ~60% similar because they share many words. I think that enables almost all Eritreans atleast to be able to understand and be able to communicate in Tigrinya. So, unless you are in an area that's Not in Eritrea, Tigrinya would work. ",
