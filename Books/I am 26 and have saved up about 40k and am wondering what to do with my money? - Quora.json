            "answer_text": "\"\"Choosing your investment spectrum depends on a lot of factors.  Create your goals and quantify them first. Understand your current position with respect to your goals and have a clear understanding how much investment would be required to achieve that goal.  Once you know your position then bring in your risk count. That is how much risk are you willing to take to achieve that goal.  These are the basics and considering all of these together would give you a clear idea of where to invest and how much to invest.Or else, investing without a goal is like going to a doctor and asking for medicines without a proper diagnosis.Also, understand the concept of compounding. That will give you an idea of the returns you can make from your investments. Accordingly, you will understand which spectrum to opt for. Also, analyse every investment even before you make the investment and have a thorough knowledge of its performance over period of time.Read about the market every day and know about assets allocation in time of emergency or when your investment is not working the way you want it to. Lastly, understand the basic concept of Compound Interest, so that you yourself can calculate your returns over a period of time.Read more financial books, journals and blogs, take control of your monthly budget, save at least 30% of your monthly income and invest that money, keep track of your investments, and most importantly have a financial plan in place. Read more and ask questions. We have a habit of not reading the fine print. Also we don't read about financial matters often, or at all. Read magazines, blogs such as this one, search online, and when you're talking to someone about investments, read the details of the investment - the terms and conditions, the charges, liquidity options, penalties, etc. Without this you'll always be illiterate and others will take advantage of that by selling you products that don't suit your requirement but earns them good commissions. All these factors would be the basics but a must. It would give you a clear idea of how much to invest, where to invest and for how long to continue that investment.\u201d\u201d ",
