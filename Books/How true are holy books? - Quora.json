            "answer_text": "a blind belief perhaps.  Just the same way you can believe bible, gita, vedas, torahs, qurans to be divine revelations.  and you wont be wrong if you dont believe any one of them to be divine either. Faith may not have anything to do with logic and though most people want to prove their faith using logic, its nothing but Goebbelsian propoganda.  Read here to know more about it : Joseph Goebbels The other famous tactics used is known as bucailleism propogated by none other than Maurice Bucaille. I will give you an example of how it works. Lets say a book wriiten in 2500 BC says:  \"it was 10 days wait for her, but it felt like 10 years\" Now, someone insired by Mr Bucaille will use the present day knowledge ofTheory of relativity and claim that the person who wrote that line 2500 BC ago knew about theory of relativity.  Then they follow that logic , into questioning, \"How could someone know about it in 2500 BC. Must be inspired from God?\" . (In their head they think it is logical to assume so, but the very premise they begin the argument from is subjective and hence there is no objectvity about it ).  Then comes into play goebbelsian propoganda, repeat the lies a thousand times until it becomes the truth. ",

            "answer_text": "When they deal with morality and good living, holy books are often very true. In fact many holy books do not go beyond these issues. When holy books talk about a God or gods and about a paradise beyond death, there is no evidence that anything is true, no matter what the holy book. ",
