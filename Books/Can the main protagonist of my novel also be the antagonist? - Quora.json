            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely! If done well, it can make the story more interesting. Here are a few ways you can do it: Make it a battle inside the main character. Maybe he is trying to be a good person and that is what the story is about.Make the character very complicated. Characters can be multi faceted! Mc (main character) could be bad, but still have good intentions. This will cause the reader to become more invested in mc, wanting to know if he is good or bad.You don't have to root for the main character. You can be absolutely horrified by what he does at some points, because that often causes more suspense.Remember that any character can be the main character. They don't always have to be the protagonist. Try taking a story then switching the perspective, you'd be surprised by how different it can be. The mc also does not always have to have the same perspective as the reader. Best of luck! Natalie ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and there are a number of ways it can be done. You can take the typical \u201cman versus self\u201d approach and have the character be fighting their own demons\u2026 or perhaps, you can take \u201cman versus self\u201d a bit more literally. For example: Your protagonist is battling against a perfect clone of themself.Your protagonist is battling a version of themself from an alternate universe/dimension.Your protagonist is battling either their past or future self by way of time travel.There are a few ways to make your protagonist and your antagonist the same person, but it\u2019s a bit tricky to pull it off correctly. It should be something of a shock to the audience, however, because it really is shocking to find that the person the hero has been up against the whole time is also the hero. ",

The protagonist Dr.Jekyll was a very moral and ethical scientist and had a tenant Mr. Hyde who turned out to be a cruel friend. A friend of Jekyll, a lawyer intervened in the matter and after death of Dr.Jekyll, he found Dr.Jekyll deliberately killesd himself. He experimented on him which used to turn him into Mr.Hyde. He used to intake some solution to turn back. He earlier liked it but when he found out the solution was decreasing he realized he won't be able to turn into Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde would take over which would cause destruction in society. Thus he killed himself  To answer your question, Yes, its possible You must have found that Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde were proto-antagonist of the story. This novel was a hit and you can also try. ",

That is what is called a protagonistic villain and an antagonistic hero - examples include Light Yagami and L in Death Note, Lelouch Lamperouge and Suzaku in Code Geass, and Walter White and Hank Schrader in Breaking Bad.* *Granted, Hank is not consistently the primary antagonist, but he is the primary hero 99% of the time.
