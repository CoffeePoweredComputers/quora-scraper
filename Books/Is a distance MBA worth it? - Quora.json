You have to choose between a full time MBA from a top/second rung management institute and a person who holds MBA degree through distance from top/second rung management institute.

In the scheme of corporate and other private sector jobs full time educational qualification is given more weightage over degree by distance education. So as for as landing a good job in an good organization is concerned than Distance MBA will not take you any distance in your career goals. If you want a great job and a super career through a MBA degree,then distance learning mode to get MBA degree is not right. It may be a time and money wastage affair in this scenario. Why ? Keep reading\u2026 There are enough job opportunities only those who get their MBA degrees from Top Management Institutes and business colleges from India and abroad. Most of Graduates from such premier or top rung Institutes get decent and well paying jobs. Pass outs from these Institutes are well qualified and are employment ready due to the curriculum followed and quality of faculty in these them. Placement cells of these top rung Institutes play a very proactive roles in helping their students get good job offers. Forget distance MBA,even MBA graduates from second rung or third rung management colleges /Institutes don't get good placement offers. Poor teaching faculty and faulty curriculum ensures that MBA grads from second/third rung Institutes are not employment ready due to less exposure and lack of conceptual clarity. Ineffective and lethargic placement system further adds to the woes of MBA pass outs from such Institutes. These degrees do more harm to them as having an MBA degree without a decent job affects their confidence and they feel disillusioned with life. If you just want to learnt about management concepts for knowledge sake or to decorate your nameplate outside your home or your visiting card, then go for MBA through distance learning. But.. Value of MBA from premier/top 20 Indian Institutes and top 20 Institutes in the world has not declined. However distance MBA can help certain business people or working executives or aspiring entrepreneurs achieve their goals as mentioned below: These distance management degrees teach working or aspiring business entrepreneurs about different management concepts unknown to them and help them in running and managing their business.These management programs may help an already working professional to learn and apply management concepts in his/her job function to perform his job better, thus helping him achieve his/her personal and professional goals.MBA degrees from distance education can help some persons earn promotions in their organizations where a management qualification is a prerequisite for promotion.If you are working professional and if you can afford it then go for distance MBA from XLRI or ISB as these premier institutes have introduced distance MBA programs to spread knowledge while increasing their revenues as it is not easy and cheap to set and run world class institutes. But to think that distance MBA will add weight to your candidature as a fresher is day dreaming. Hope it helps! Mritunjaya Malhan \u00a9 2019 All rights reserved.
