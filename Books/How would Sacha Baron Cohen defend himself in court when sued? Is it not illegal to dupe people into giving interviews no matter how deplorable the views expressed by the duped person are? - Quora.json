            "answer_text": "He\u2019s been sued before and won every one that\u2019s come to public light. Cohen, whose comedy isn\u2019t my cup of tea, is a master of disguise but the videos he presents generally represent what the person said or did. He\u2019s even won Anti-SLAPP claims against people causing them to pay the legal bill. He\u2019s not taping someone and changing their answer, so he\u2019s not splicing tapes when a person said \u201cno\u201d and changed that to a \u201cyes\u201d; that would be defamation. Cohen\u2019s style is simply to give you enough rope to let your own ignorance hang you. No one compels you to say I want to train 3 year olds to play with peetey the pistol (he also shows Matt Gaetz - R a representative who told him no) or to bounce around with your pants on the ground shouting racial slurs. That\u2019s conduct they chose to engage in. His disguises may be elaborate but if you have any knowledge of the subject matter he\u2019s trying to deceive you on the disguise is pretty easy to see. No one compelled Joe Wilson to say the 2nd Amendment doesn\u2019t have an age limit while supporting the \u201ckinder guardian\u201d program, his choice. I\u2019m sure Cohen could get me with several characters. I\u2019m totally ignorant of many pop culture things, my wife had to explain to me who Taylor Swift is. Cohen\u2019s Israeli Commando though is completely cliche and I wouldn\u2019t for a minute after he started talking buy that. He\u2019s reflecting their ignorance on a subject matter; sometimes that\u2019s just comedy, like the couple who really believes the ultra-liberal character has a wife who is cheating on him with a dolphin. Sometimes its a mirror that shows a disturbingly \u201cteamist\u201d mentality of hey this guy favors gun rights so no matter how stupid anything he says is I\u2019m going along with it. ",

            "answer_text": "The types of lying that are illegal are fraud, false advertising, perjury, and defamation. Cohen is avoiding all of these. Free speech guarantees that anything that isn\u2019t one of the above is legal. (Okay, you could add child pornography, incitement to commit a crime, and a few other extreme things to the list of illegal forms of speech. But we\u2019re talking about lying here, so let\u2019s move on.) If Cohen is not tricking them into giving him money or property directly, then this isn\u2019t fraud or false advertising. He\u2019s not making false defamatory remarks. And he is not sworn in at a trial or deposition. So this is just regular old lying. Hell, fiction is \u201clying\u201d, so you can\u2019t exactly claim saying untrue statements should have a blanket prohibition. Actors are misrepresenting who they are on screen throughout the course of an entire movie or show. Further, prank shows depend on the ability to misrepresent reality to unsuspecting people for the entertainment of the audience. They have clearly demonstrated that this is legal. At least Cohen isn\u2019t doing a hidden camera show. Which makes him significantly different than James O\u2019Keefe, the conservative activist who does \u201cstings\u201d on organizations like Planned Parenthood. Additionally, O\u2019Keefe has been vilified for doing significant editing to remove context and make innocuous statements into damaging sound bites. While Cohen has been observed doing that too, mostly Cohen puts mics on his interviewees, lets the camera roll and includes both question and response. Pretty far from what Project Veritas has been doing.[1] Footnotes[1] Sacha Baron Cohen Is Duping Republicans. Is He the James O\u2019Keefe of the Left?",
