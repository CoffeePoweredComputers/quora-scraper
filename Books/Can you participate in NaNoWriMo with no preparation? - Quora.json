            "answer_text": "Absolutely! I just convincced someone to join last minute. All you need for Nano is a place to write, and generally by the first week a story line is kinda nice to have in mind. But NaNo's made to be messy, made to be fun. Blurt out. 50000 words, then future you can mould it into a story. Go for it. Each word you write is one more than you had at the start! (Also for non-writers, or people who already have a first draft. There are comic, editing and screenwriting options as well. I can't remember the conversion rate off the top of my head, but its on the website). Goodluck! ",

You\u2019ll face all kinds of decisions you won\u2019t be prepared to make - you\u2019ll unfortunately think of it as writers\u2019 block - and you\u2019ll stall, get frustrated and probably give up. I do all of my research in advance (September and October) so I have a basis for the novel. I usually start with a rough chapter outline that I end up abandoning at chapter four because my characters tell me which way the story should go, not the way I planned. But that\u2019s better. ",

Having completed NaNoWriMo with both planning and \u201cpants-ing\u201d I find that no planning forces me to just write. When I have a plan everything hinges on getting to the next part in my outline. You can also take a hybrid approach and use the first day as your planning day. No matter what, START WRITING! Good Luck making words dance. ",
