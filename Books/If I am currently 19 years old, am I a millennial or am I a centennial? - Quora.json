            "answer_text": "You are 19 in 2018. You were born in 1999. You are not a Millennial, you are a member of Generation Z (1996 - mid 2000s), sometimes called the iGen. I haven\u2019t seen it called the Centennials. The best information I can find for the generational cohort birth dates is on the Pew Research Center\u2019s website. Generational cutoff points aren\u2019t an exact science. They should be viewed primarily as tools, allowing for the kinds of analyses detailed above. But their boundaries are not arbitrary. Generations are often considered by their span, but again there is no agreed upon formula for how long that span should be. At 16 years (1981 to 1996), our working definition of Millennials will be equivalent in age span to their preceding generation, Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980). By this definition, both are shorter than the span of the Baby Boomers (19 years) \u2013 the only generation officially designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, based on the famous surge in post-WWII births in 1946 and a significant decline in birthrates after 1964.[1]  Thus, for the various birth cohorts, we have: 1928 - 1944The Silent Generation; they are the successors to the G.I. generation, 1901 - 1928, that was named by Tom Brokaw the Greatest Generation.(The Greatest Generation was my father\u2019s (b. 1913) and my mother\u2019s (b. 1925) generation. They fought WW II. My father was a marine Master Sergeant who fought in every major battle in the Pacific island hoping campaign. My mother was a Rosie the Riveter type who worked in an aircraft manufacturing plant stamping out wings. They returned to civilian life after the War and worked in the 1950s to make America the juggernaut it became by the 1960s.)1945 - 1964The Baby Boomers. These are the children of the Greatest and the Silent generations.(This is my generation; I am one of the early ones, being born in 1948 to two Greatest Generation parents.)1965 - 1980Generation X1981 - 1996The Millennials (Generation Y)1997 - mid 2000sGeneration Z (the iGeneration, or just iGen)\u201c[T]here is little consensus regarding ending birth years. \u201d[2]You are 19 in 2018. You were born in 1999. You are not Millennial. You are a member of Generation Z, the iGen. \u201cMost of Generation Z have used the Internet since a young age, and they are generally comfortable with technology and with interacting on social media.\u201d[3] Footnotes[1] Defining generations: Where Millennials end and post-Millennials begin[2] Generation Z - Wikipedia[3] Generation Z - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "At age 19, your birth year is 1998 or 1999 (if you are currently 19 and turn 20 this year, your birth year is 1998, else 1999). A birth year of 1998 or 1999 is in the disagreement fuzzy-zone between the millennial generation / Generation Y and the the Homeland generation / Net generation / Generation Z, which is rather large. If you go by Gallup or Pew Research Center, you are Net generation. If you go by Strauss and Howe, you are a millennial.

The net generation is born into the core of the information / digital age where everything\u2019s online from birth. They will have the internet from birth. From a time perspective, millennials were born prior to the turn of the millennium but came of age after, while the net generation are born after the turn of the millennium.
