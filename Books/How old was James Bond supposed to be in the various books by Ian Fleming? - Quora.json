            "answer_text": "This is impossible to answer definitely as the chronology of the Bond novels  is inconsistent.  It is not even easy to establish what year many of the adventures took place.    Here is some information based on Ian Fleming's James Bond: Anotations and Chronologies by John Griswald  In Casino Royale Bond says he bought his Bentley in 1933. If he was 17 when he bought it, he was born in 1915. As Casino Royale takes place in 1951 or 1952 he was 36.Moonraker implies he was 37 in 1954 (he has 8 years until he loses his 00 status at age 45) making his birth year 1917.Diamonds are Forever also takes place in 1954.From Russia with Love also takes place in 1954 and says Bond entered the Secret Service in 1938. It also takes place simultaneously with the previous two stories, which is impossible.Doctor No. takes place in 1956.Goldfinger took place in 1957. It also says Bond has been a 00 for six years.Thunderball takes place in 1959.The Spy Who Loved Me takes place in 1961.OHMSS was 1960/61 or 1962/63 (there are two inconsistent dates given).You Only Live Twice takes place in 1962/63. It says that Bond was born in the year of the Rat (1924)  It also says Bond entered the Secret Service in 1941, aged 19 which would make his birth year 1922.The Man With The Golden Gun takes place in 1963/64",

            "answer_text": "Judging by his physical and mental abilities I would put Bond at early 40s. Obviously he doesn't age. I disagree with Graeme Shimmin - Bond's age across the series is completely irrelevant, otherwise he would have been dead already. Bond is pictured as a very mature man, that has a very well established view of the world, his place in it and what he wants to do with his life. He is very good and very experienced at what he does. Thus the age - early 40s the pinnacle of man mental abilities (at the same time with training maintaining almost pinnacle of his physical abilities). Bond is the same age across the movies. He is not supposed to age. He will not be married (the movie where he was married was made due to plot reasons, they have done it to show the maturity level of Bond - if he was a teeny like womaniser it doesn't make the picture right), he will never have children he will never MOVE ON. Bond is a single man (being married once), at his peak. This will be and shall be the same across all series (may it last forever). ",
