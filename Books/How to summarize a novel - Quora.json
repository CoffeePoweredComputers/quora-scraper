Next, lightly trace the twists and turns (he falls in love with a girl, only to discover she is the crime boss\u2019s daughter. He recruits a friend, who proves unreliable. The police don\u2019t seem keen to hold up their end of the deal), and then the conclusion (he is killed in a police raid). Address the themes (hubris, betrayal, injustice), but don\u2019t apply values statements (this is a good/bad novel). ",
