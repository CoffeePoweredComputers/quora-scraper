            "answer_text": "Notes are, I believe a personalized thing. They differ from person to person, because the thing important for one may be already known to other. JEE is about concepts and understanding. Most of the questions revolve around certain important topics. Students usually study them properly and stuff. So to note them, you can mark the topic using stars or arrows or anything like that. You can use two different colored pens, one for the normal info and one that is important for the preparation point of view(try to refrain from using more than two, you're a science student). Next is the small points which are important and can help you a lot in case you remember them or know them. They are what actually create the difference between the good rankers and average ones. So these points are to be separated from the text. As for me, I wrote these points in the margins or on top of the page in the blank space, sometimes on the back of the notebook. In short anywhere that you can see them again in a short span of time and that they stick to your mind. An important thing though, not every random point is important. You have to realise which one is. Finally, you have to study your notes regularly. Making them won't do anything. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I made short notes. How did I make notes? I took care that my notes don't contain all the information. When your notes contain everything, your brain contains less.  Make your notes in your brain. Make short notes on paper which can act as a trigger to recall the knowledge. If your notes will contain every detail, what will your brain contain? How will you exercise your memory? Make notes which contain hint of knowledge but not knowledge. Regards Nishant Jindal Image Source : Google Images ",

First of all get good study material.coaching notes and local board notes mix them together with the book you follow or just make a combination by taking best of each. Make it shorter (I made notes of unit 1 in Physics for not more then 13 pages) You will have to work hard to prepare best notes but that would be a boon fotr you in your revision.

Make note of all reactions, catalytic reactions, word reactions and analytical reactions.Notes are based on tests you give, some reactions might be ignored in NCERT, but you will find them when you give tests.Maths and Physics generally only require formula notes, specially Coordinate and Data grouping in Maths and COM, Electricity, Magnetism and Semiconductors in Physics.Biochemistry notes should be based on previous year questions and basic knowledge of reactions.For JEE Advanced All notes as JEE MainsExtra inclusion of reactions from previous year analysis reactions, reactions from external books.For physics and maths, physics requires knowledge so notes won't help much. For maths, make short notes of formulas from coordinate and basic knowledge of vector and space.Exclusion of Biochemistry from notes.",

            "answer_text": "Most of the student take it for granted but making notes is very assential because when your jee will be near so you won\u2019t have time to turn all the pages of your books or regester of particular subject or chapter(since the syllabus is too vast), it will seem that no matter for how much hours you study your syllabus is endless and eventually you will be dropping some of the chapters in particular subjects. So my idea of making notes is based on my experience. 1st you should read the chapter understand it solve numericals and after that switch your subject or do another work. 2nd you should try to solve the previous year question on your own. 3rd start analysing that which part of that particular chapter is troubling you, read that part of the chapter or consult your respective teacher. After the whole process the short notes comes into play as now you have realised that what part of the chapter you have to revise again and again to make it perfect and than only your shorts notes will literally be short and will be more precised. Thankyou for reading such a long answer,hope it helps (in my case it worked well). Best of luck. ",

First of all try to maintain two different notebooks,one for only notes and another one for sheet ,dpp solutions because in last months for revising important questions from sheets dpps ,these notebooks will surely help you. And in class notes copy try to write important concepts and points in your own language because there are different point of view for any problem ,concept and a teacher can only tell you all cases .they can not make you spoon feeding. So it's your responsibility to note all the important points in copy during class discussions. Hope it will help you. ",
