            "answer_text": "Option 1: Sell the business. Option 2: Keep the business and hire someone to run it for you. Option 3: Give the business to the employees or let them buy it from you progressively over time. Option 4: Give it to a family member. Option 5: Shut it down if it\u2019s not doing much or earning much or is too much of a headache to sell or give away. And by the way, some folks here answering your question are right, building a business and writing a novel are both time consuming things to do. But you can do both especially if you enjoy both. Just know that both are exhausting. You might consider just getting a job to keep income coming in and writing in the morning, weekends and possibly evenings. Or work part time to keep food on the table and write the rest of the time. Even better, get a job at a bookstore or library. Or get a job in an area that your novel\u2019s central character might be involved in. I have written (and never finished) a few novels. Though I have written 5 published non-fiction books however. They were all written as I started and ran more than one business or worked at a full time job. I treated them like a part time job. None of them paid all the bills. Good luck with it all! ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t try to bite of more than you can chew. Setting up a business is a full-time commitment that will eat up most of your time. The same goes for writing a best-seller. You\u2019d need time, dedication and unwavering concentration to actually write a best seller, leave alone go through the gruelling process of getting publishing houses to actually publish your literary work. Step 1. Choose business or writing a best seller.Focus on getting whatever you choose, right.Once you\u2019ve achieved everything you\u2019d set out to achieve, you can focus your energies on the other.This is an easier way to be successful and the path ahead will be much clearer.I strongly urge you to not pursue more than one thing seriously, because, when both don\u2019t work out the way you expect it to, you\u2019ll lose interest in both. Not saying you can\u2019t achieve what you want to or that you\u2019re incapable, just saying it\u2019s an extremely hard thing to manage both at the same time. ",
