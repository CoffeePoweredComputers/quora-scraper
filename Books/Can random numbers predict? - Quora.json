            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes But can they predict accurately? That\u2019s a more nuanced question. In probability, there\u2019s a technique called the Monte Carlo method. If you want to test something which is complicated to demonstrate analytically, say the area under a very complicated curve for a simple example then one approach is to draw a square round the region you want to analyse. Then pick a random point in the square and see if it lies under the curve. Repeat this many times, and the proportion of points under the curve will give you approximately the ratio of the area under the curve to that of the square. For a more subtle approach, consider tarot cards. Picking one card is effectively picking a random number. That card then has various ambiguous phrases associated with it. The person whose fortune is being told will then react to one or two of those phrases, which an experienced \u2018clairvoyant\u2019 can pick up on and use to make predictions about, reinforcing the results by watching for more reactions. You may reasonably claim that the random number (card) is not making any predictions in reality but there are many people who have been fooled into believing it, and sometimes those predictions are self-fulfilling.
