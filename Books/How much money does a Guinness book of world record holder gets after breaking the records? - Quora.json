            "answer_text": "Hey Sahil, i hope you are having a good time. I have mentioned previously also that we do not get money for breaking any of the Guinnessworldrecords. The only thing which you get is an official Guinnessworldrecords certificate which will be having the details of your record achievement. One add-on, they could publish your record in their annual Guinnessworldrecords book but that too if the record is very unique or it is very eye catchy otherwise your record will be in a huge queue to be appeared in Book. Hope you will get your answer. Have a great time  ",

In fact if someone wants to use their fast trail (priority application) services, they have to pay an considerable amount of fee depending on amount of resources needed for the event. If you choose the Priority Application option, your application will be reviewed within 5 working days. Normal application processing can take up to 12 weeks. p.s. payment is to be done only by paypal or worldpay. ",
