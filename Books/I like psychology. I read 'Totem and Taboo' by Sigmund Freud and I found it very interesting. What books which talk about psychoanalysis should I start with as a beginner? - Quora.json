            "answer_text": "Know this, I think the Freud was an indirect practitioner of what is today Brain Plasticity because he delved in mind awareness as if it were an separate entity that really affected the genetic mechanics, and that depending in its command in self-belief from the naturalistic standpoint, no mental illnesses could take place. This means a reality other than genetic is at work in humanity. He had a big ambition to figure out the old historical so called mythology and he did not devoid anything supernatural but attempted to interpret differently and lacked what I know now partly borrowed from Asia, psycho-electromagnetism. Also know this, he was a yo/yo in religious certainty for himself all along. I think my knowledge today would have solved his puzzle in both theory and fact of all so called mythology, and quit all religious panic. ",

            "answer_text": "I would strongly suggest that you start at the beginning, with an \u201cIntro to psychology\u201d textbook. It may sound tedious, but there is a discipline involved in learning that is its own reward. In psychology, you really want to build up a wealth of theoretical perspectives, and the history surrounding them. ",
