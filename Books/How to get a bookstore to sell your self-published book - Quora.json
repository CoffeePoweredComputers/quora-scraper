            "answer_text": "First, you need to ask yourself why you want this. Purely from a business (time-and-money) perspective, bookstores are terrible places for your book. You have a statistically zero-percent chance of getting your book into any of the chains (at the chain level) \u2014 and getting it into individual stores (chains or independent) is a matter of \u201cselling\u201d to each and every store. Then, to accomplish even this, they will want the arrangement to be consignment with unconditional returns for anywhere from 60 to 120 days. This is not them being jerks; this is just the financial reality of running a bookstore. After all that effort \u2014 and let\u2019s say you do get your book into a few stores \u2014 you\u2019ll earn in the end maybe a few bucks from each copy sold. (Hugely variable depending on your print costs, cover price, etc.) Then, to succeed in keeping your books available in the stores, you\u2019ll have to bust your butt to promote and sell the copies that are there. Shelf space is precious in a bookstore, so they can\u2019t afford to tolerate books that just sit there. And your book has literally thousands of other books as competition, so it\u2019ll unlikely \u201csell itself,\u201d nor will the store put special attention to your book. How does all that sound? I could go on and on, and at the chain level it\u2019s even worse for various reasons. But the point is \u2014 think outside the bookstore. Unless your #1 goal in life has been to see your book in a bookstore (and that\u2019s fair and understandable), then ignore this channel, at least to start. Focus on online sales, large-quantity sales to organizations, and other avenues that give you the best income return for your time and effort invested. Being self-published means running a business, and running a business means you need to bring in money to keep going. It\u2019s the gas in your tank. I\u2019m not going to get into sales here because there are many other Quora questions on that you can search. But focus on the better ways to sell your book first; otherwise, you\u2019ll either run out of resources to keep going or you\u2019ll run out of enthusiasm from a lack of success. Plus, whatever success you can create outside of bookstores will help you eventually in getting interest from bookstore managers. Put simply, if you can say your book has been selling very well, that\u2019s much more motivating for them than if you have little or no sales. Also, keep in mind non-book stores. If you have a book on dog obedience training, for example, you\u2019d be better off approaching stores and businesses that sell to dog owners \u2014 more focused market and less competition with other books. Last, to answer your question more directly\u2026 If you really and truly do want to see your book in a bookstore, then focus on the locals in your area. Most independents will do their best to support local authors, often with a special section dedicated to their books. Barnes & Noble and the few other remaining chains will also be supportive to the extent they can, although they\u2019re more constrained in what they can do, due to larger corporate-level considerations. But the good news is\u2026 B&N has gone through a huge financial and cultural makeover in the past year, which may lend itself to more openness toward self-published authors. They\u2019ve been using their down time during the pandemic to revamp the stores and roll out new concepts. Only time will tell how this fares, but fingers crossed, it\u2019ll be better for indie authors. [Answered: How do you get your self-published book in bookstores?] ",

            "answer_text": "How? First, Congrats on Completing your book. If you have a really phenomenal one of a kind idea, go to AgentQuery ( Find the Agent Who Will Find You a Publisher ) and start pitching to agents. It takes a while and 100\u2019s of submissions for most to get an agent. Don\u2019t get discouraged. Every great author goes through this and the rejection that comes with it and you could have a bestseller or just get lucky. Don\u2019t pay people to publish your book. This is called vanity publishing. With the exception of a select few, these guys are not going to help you get into stores or promote your book beyond putting in on their website. I wouldn\u2019t wait for an agent though. Here are some things to do while you wait. Upload your book on the Amazon for your country. You can make it exclusive to amazon or upload it to other sites like smashwords, lulu, etc. But careful not to double publish as Lulu will send your book to Amazon unless you uncheck the box. These are online stores, but most people buy eBooks anyway.If it\u2019s non-fiction (like how to do something, live, etc), send a free copy to industry influencers and tell them it would mean the world to you (in your own words ) if they\u2019d check out your book. If one of them really likes it, you might get your first big fan and an ally who will help you get a publisher.If you really want a book you can hold in your hand, then visit Createspace.com (part of Amazon). They will make you a physical copy for about $12-$15 USD depending on the bookCreate a website with a free service.Promote on social mediaStart a regular blog that will attract people who would like your book. You should imagine this person in your head and write specifically to this person. This is called your Target Audience, Buyer Persona, Customer Avatar. They\u2019re all the same thing.Good Luck. ~Leigh  ",
