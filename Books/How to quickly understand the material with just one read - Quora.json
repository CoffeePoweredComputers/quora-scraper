            "answer_text": "A2A: \u201cHow do I quickly understand the material with just one read?\u201d Thanks for the A2A. Usually, such a question gets about 100 views, and 2 upvotes, so I will try to do a good job. The word understand, or to understand something, means to have a clear and true idea or notion of something, or full and exact knowledge of something. This is the result of a process. (Webster\u2019s 1942 Dictionary of Synonyms.)To understand \u201cthe material with just one read\u201d you will have to understand the words in that material before hand, or define them just before you read the material for understanding. One way, one process, one might use, if you do not understand all of the words in this new piece of material is to quickly make up a Word List for the material you want to read just before you read it for understanding. You may have to practice with this little process a bit, till you gain the ability to do this comfortably and easily. Here is an example. As a substitute teacher, I was supposed to ask the students for their homework. Only one boy said he did not have it. So, I said, to him, let\u2019s go over this later in the day when we have a free period. At that time, he said he had not read it, so I asked him to present the assignment and read it outloud to me. Each time he showed any sign of stress or strain, or lack of comprehension, I stopped him and asked, \u201cIs there a word there you do not understand?\u201d We found the word, he clarified it, and he reread that part. By the time we finished that one page, those first 200 words, he was going faster and faster, pretty much flying along, and we had located 80 words that he did not know how to read, he had not understood them beforehand, and now he did. When they were clarified, he could read all of the material there, and he did understand it. So I am saying when one understands the words they read in some material they can understand it. As it happened, this boy was within 3 months of graduation, at the largest high school in our area, and was being tutored at home in Phonics, in the evenings. The lack of Phonics was not the problem, \u201cnot understanding the words\u201d, was the problem, and it was easily correctable, on the spot. So, one could quickly make up a Word List, for that one piece of material you want to read with understanding, just like I did, more or less, with this boy. You would start at the top of the page, and quickly scan over the material very quickly, much faster than you would normally read, when you are reading for understanding, and just look for any word there that does not instantly register with you as a word you do understand. When you spot one, you instantly stop, write down just that one word you do not understand, and instantly again, finish your scan of the material. Each time you spot a word that does not instantly register to you, you stop and write it down, add it to your Word List, and instantly put your attention back on your scan from that that point and continue the scan again, to the end of the page or material. This should take just a few seconds, or a minute, for one page. You are just locating the words on that one page that you do not know, that you do not instantly recognize. Now you have a Word List for that material, or the first page of that material. Now if there are only 200 words in the material, just one page, and you have 80 words on your Word List, this might not be the best way to approach this effort. If you have a few, you just clarify each one with a dictionary properly. Then, you read the material for understanding. If you do not know how to define a word properly, then I recommend you do learn how to do that, first. Here is a book you can work through, or better yet, you and a friend, or a tutor, can work through to help you learn how to define a word properly. See the book  It is available on Amazon today, for as little as $2.00, but you may be able to locate it at your local library to borrow, or they may be able to locate it for you to work through it right there at the library. So, let\u2019s assume, that at this point we have clarified the definition of the word understanding, how to locate a word you do not understand in the material you want to read, and how to properly define any word, using the book, How to Use a Dictionary. Now, your understanding might be different than mine. So, I as a tutor, could check your understanding of something, by asking a couple of questions. I could first check your understanding of a word, and notice how long it took you to answer my question. If you do not know the meaning of a word well enough to answer such a question quickly and easily, with full understanding, then it might be a good idea to learn it a little better, so you can recognize it instantly when you encounter it, when reading and in our culture. You could practice this with a friend. Have your friend take one of your Word Lists, and select any word on it, or better yet each one, one after the other, and then ask you, \u201cWhat is the definition of the word ______?\u201d or \u201cTell me the meaning of the word _____ in your own words?\u201d Then, I would have you use the word in some sentences, and check for how long it takes you to respond, and whether you used the word in the same exact sense it was used in your material. You might have to use a word in 10 or more of your own sentences before you fully make it your own. Now one\u2019s understanding can increase if they demonstrate something. Just take some small objects like coins, paper clips, keys, or small stones or glass beads and demo the meaning of a concept, or how a word is used. One may be able to use it in sentences, but not demo how it is used with actual objects. The difference is the amount of mass one has use. A though has little or no mass. A demo requires, mass, action, sequence, location, relationships. It requires a lot more understanding to do that. So if I were testing you, I might ask you to do a demo. Doing a demo is also a Self Test, do you know something well enough to apply it? Do a demo and find out. If you are still having trouble with making all this work for you then I suggest you take a good study course like The Basic Study Manual or The Student Hat Course. The Student Hat Course is the one I took. Let me know how you are doing. Best regards, Leon ",

Sometimes one read is enough, sometimes you need to read it ten times and use other supports (like another course, a dictionary, some internet research). There is no way to escape it. Just check you can explain it to anybody around you: friend, student, family member. If not, go back to work. ",
