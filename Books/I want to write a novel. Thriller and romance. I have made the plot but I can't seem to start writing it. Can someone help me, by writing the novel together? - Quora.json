            "answer_text": "Asking someone to help you write your novel is like asking someone to \u201chelp\u201d you with your homework. Unless, of course, you\u2019re looking to hire a ghost writer. If that\u2019s the case then hire away, otherwise\u2026 Consider that you may not be ready to write a novel. Instead, pick some key ideas from your plot and write them as short stories. Rinse, repeat. Consider that an effective chapter is like a short story, except maybe the ending of it might spill over into the next chapter. Think of it as developmental writing for your novel. When you get enough material, start putting it together and fill in the missing plot. ",

My advice though, is to know that your first draft is supposed to be messy. Second draft fixes grammar mistakes, and third draft shifts ideas and/or dialogue, fourth draft revises small details, and final draft can still be edited\u2014but is pretty much the real thing. Let me know when we should start! ",
