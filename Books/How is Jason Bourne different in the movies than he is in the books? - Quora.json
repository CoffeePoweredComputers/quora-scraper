            "answer_text": "First of all, he is NO ASSASSIN sent to kill that big politician, as shown in the bourne identity. Yes, he is a highly trained killer. But as in the movies, he was NOT trained by the CIA. According to the books, he was trained by a much covert operation called \"Medusa\" and before that he was an analyst for the military, but Medusa was the one who made him Jason Bourne (real name, David Webb) The sole purpose of his mission when he lost his memory-which lasted 3 years, btw-was to draw out another assassin named Carlos-the Jackal who operated from Paris. David (or Delta, as he came to be known while in Medusa) posed as Jason Bourne (the real JB was killed by Delta while in medusa because he was a traitor), an assassin in the east, China. He assassinated NO ONE. He merely claimed responsibility for some impossible kills made by Carlos, or any other assassin, and got famous. Then he moved to Germany, in Carlos's territory, and started claiming kills he had nothing to do with. The objective, to draw out Carlos and kill him. It was an elaborate trap which nearly worked in the first book, despite Bourne's loss of memory. The role of CIA was about 15% in the whole book, although they did try to kill him multiple times. The reason he joined Medusa was he had a wife and two kids who were shot down by an air strike, and that left him damaged. This reason sort of became important in the third book.But he was NOT AN assassin for the CIA, meant to kill those who hurt the American Government. He was far, far from that. ",
