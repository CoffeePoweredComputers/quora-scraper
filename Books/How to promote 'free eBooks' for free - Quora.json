            "answer_text": "Hi, Great Question! You can promote your free ebook by posting it into forums of people who are interested in the topic of your ebook. This may include Facebook groups, Quora questions, subedits, Twitter, Instragram, Pinterest to just name a few places. Usually the best strategy is through your own content marketing. However, if you don\u2019t have a budget, then the free routes are probably the best option. The one secret that many authors mess up here is that they assume other authors want to buy their books. So, don\u2019t try selling your books on self-published author forums. Rather, push your books to your target audience wherever that may be. \u2606\u2605\u2606 100+ more answers -> CLICK on my Profile \u2606\u2605\u2606 P.S. If this answer was helpful...
