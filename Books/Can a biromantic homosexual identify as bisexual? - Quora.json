            "answer_text": "I think that\u2019s up to you. You\u2019re using the split attraction model to describe your sexuality as a biromantic homosexual. When the words gay, straight, and later, bisexual were first applied to sexuality, they predated the split attraction model quite a bit, so they don\u2019t quite line up easily. The fact is that allosexual people who don\u2019t have split attractions are going to usually interpret bisexual as biromantic bisexual. Here you have a few options: Identify as bisexual anyway if you feel like you\u2019re \u201cclose enough\u201d/if you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019d prefer not to explain your sexuality/romantic attractionIdentify as bisexual if you feel like you belong in the larger bisexual community with diverse romantic orientations and sexualities (and are okay with people misinterpreting that sometimes)You could also do what some people I know do, and identify as queer to simplify things down.If none of those seem like a good match, feel free to continue identifying as biromantic homosexual. I would just like to throw this out there: Your romantic attraction to women is valid. I\u2019m sure there are people out there who will love to eyeroll at you and say \u201cOkay, but you\u2019re really gay\u201d or whatever. You don\u2019t have to do anything with women or have any kind of relationships for your attraction to be validated. It is just inherently valid. ",

You are open to romantic relationships with both men and women (Biromantic), but you are only open to sexual relationships with men (Homosexual). This sexuality is somewhat of a minority, but that is perfectly okay! (I myself am also an LGBT+ minority, being Panromantic Demisexual) However, it is also perfectly okay to identify as Bisexual, since this term can be sort of an umbrella term for all things Bi- and Homo-. I do this in my situation as well. If I meet someone, and the topic of my sexuality comes up, I simply say I am Pansexual. If I then feel that I can explain myself into further detail, I would go deeper into my label, explaining I am actually Panromantic Demisexual. (Romantically attracted to anyone, regardless of gender, but only sexually attracted to those that I have a strong bond with) I would advise that you try this as well, as it has worked fairly well for me!

I'm not saying this because I'm one of those whack-jobs that thinks that labels are evil. I'm saying this because words are clunky and they create barriers and motivations to fit your life into terms that you can communicate to others (seriously, who doesn't want to be well-understood by their circle of associates?). Because of this, you will end up artificially adjusting your behavior simply to make yourself easier to define and explain.  First be yourself. Stop worrying about the labels. After you have found your identity then we can sit down and explain the nuances of who you are. But we will do that casually and intellectually. When we have a dispassionate conversion that is free of guilt or expectations then we will achieve understanding of who you are. But that can never happen until you walk away from fitting in to clunky words that never truly define your innate value as a human being. ",

            "answer_text": "Bisexual is just a word in order to help others understand your sexuality. There is no set official requirements that much be reached in order to obtain the unimportant title of bisexual. For me it just means you like girls and guys. There are countless definitions for differnet sexuality. Some of my friends identify themselves as sluts even though it is normally derogatory. Basically don't worry about if other people will think of what you call yourself just consider yourself whatever you want. Another example is that I say my eye color is layered because that's what it looks like to me. However a lot of people claim that it's hazel but then I'll say hazel is all the colors mixed together but guess what it is only a word to discribe my own ideas. So whatever you decide to call yourself no one has any right to say otherwise because your sexuality is up to you and not them. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, I was in the same situation but with opposite genders. I'm a female mostly interested in women but I could see myself with a man. I choose to label myself as bisexual (or pansexual if I think they'll know the term) because it doesn't put me in the 100% gay box. I think there's a big misconception that bi/pansexuality is sexual attraction to everyone equally when it's really not. Even with heterosexual people we know they're not attracted to everyone of the opposite gender. Just like that, it's ok to be bisexual and prefer one gender over the other. At the end of the day though it is your decision. The reason I choose the term bisexual is because I want people to know that I'm open to all genders, whether I'm attracted to them back or not is just chance just as with any other sexuality and relationship. Good luck :) ",
