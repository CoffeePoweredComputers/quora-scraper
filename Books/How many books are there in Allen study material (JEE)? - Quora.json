            "answer_text": "HCV is a must. In IOC you can solve(and memorize) the book by Shri Vishal Joshi(senior IOC faculty at Allen),published by Cengage.For OC,you can solve(and memorize) the book by Akshay Choudhary,published by Pearson(senior OC faculty at Allen).There are no special books for Maths and Physical Chemistry. You can consolidate your concepts to a very high degree even without solving these books if you honestly solve Allen's study material and get your doubts cleared regularly. Except the first one,the other two are not mandatory in all batches . If you have still some time left,you can solve Irodov.Remember,quality is more important than quantity . ",
