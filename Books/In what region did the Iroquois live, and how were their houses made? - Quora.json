            "answer_text": "The Iroquois Confederation of multiple tribes from the 1300\u2019s-1800\u2019s was roughly from the Great Lakes well into Ontario, New York, Western Pennsylvania, and probably more. They used \u201clonghouses\u201d a lot which look much like Viking lodges of the period (who influenced who is unknown but they\u2019re unusual structures to just that part of the Northeast where there\u2019s lots of Viking indications.) Peter Nabokov\u2019s excellent book \u201cNative American Architecture\u201d (he\u2019s an architect) devotes a chapter to longhouse construction for the best explanation I\u2019ve ever come across. It\u2019s a long structure much like a Viking longship hull in shape with curved wooden structural members like ship\u2019s ribs sheathed with large pieces of tree bark and partially sunken into the earth sometimes so several feet of it are especially insulated from the very cold winter winds. It\u2019s then separated with interior walls of bark or tanned large animal hides into public and private spaces, storage, cooking, workspace etc. and could accommodate 10\u201340+ residents. Very efficient, flexible, and smart construction using readily available but durable materials like Native American architecture in general (in many ways a much smarter solution than the Europeans brought and used into the 20th Century.) These would be clustered so a village would have several to dozens of longhouses along with storage and other out structures (women during the messy part of their cycle often were sequestered in small, quite separate structures among the tribes.) The villages had a tall log palisade with sharpened ends, the butt of the log set 4\u2032 into the soil, internal bracing, a shooting platform for archers, and a clever entrance control system. Extensive farming fields surround the palisaded village so the farmers (and food stockpiles) are protected from the endless raids by neighboring tribes as well as hungry wild animals.) ",
