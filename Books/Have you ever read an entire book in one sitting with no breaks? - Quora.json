            "answer_text": "When I used to read science fiction yes, all the time, though it came and went in bouts dependant on what life was doing at the time. It\u2019s been so long since I read any fiction though I can\u2019t even remember the last book I read. All I can remember is some of the authors that I know I read cover to cover, People like Heinlein, Niven, and clarke. I do remember the first book I read cover to cover, multiple times, The hitch hiker in the point horror series, I used to start and finish that on long train journeys. I didn\u2019t find it all that life altering like some people seem to suggest here, it was just too interesting to put down and when I get focused in the flow it\u2019s pretty hard to slow down. I\u2019d get like stages of wanting the toilet or to eat and kept saying, ah, after this chapter, the thing is I just didn\u2019t stop after that chapter. lol By the time I closed the book I would usually collapse though and then have epic dreams. Of course more than once I also picked up the next book. If I had it, I used to shop in a second hand sci fi book shop in london, massive place was the size of full library and had nearly all of the authors I read all the time but every now and again I would pick up a set with one missing from the middle and have to wait a week or two. I would usually pick up between 5\u201310 books sometimes even 25 book long series. I like stories, well told and long, epic, huge stories and that trend does continue with a love of things like the babylon five series. I remember HMV was having a sale when I was back in woodgreen london, I can still remember the lay out of the shop in fact, anyway. I remember buying Babylong 5 for the first time on my girlfriends recommendation at the time. Same shop I marathoned Firefly from. B5. Season One. Box set, less than half price, I went down in the morning, we started it mid afternoon. I figured ya know we would watch a couple of episodes grab some dinner\u2026na, by HMV\u2019s closing time the following day I had to go back and buy the all the other four seasons. Three days later. I bought all the movies available at the time too. That was an epic week. We did take breaks for regular eating, sex and toilet breaks but that was a week of virtually no sleep. Don\u2019t take away my Jayne hat for saying this but B5 is one of the best, biggest and most epic created stories in the history of sci fi television. It\u2019s history stretches the span of millions of years in the past to a million years into the future. And if you like sci fi and don\u2019t know it, heres a few more words on it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I have! The funny thing about it is that although I'm a really fast reader, I tend to lose focus quickly due to my A.D.D. and I hated taking my adderall for various reasons. Normally, I'll get through the first chapter and get distracted. It's strange because my eyes are reading, but my brain is thinking about what to make for dinner, wondering if my son remembered to turn in his field trip form, why is the cat puking on my freshly mopped floor? (You get it lol). This usually makes me have to read that same content over and over until I get frustrated enough to give up. Well, because of this, I simply hated reading. However, a friend of mine left her current book at my house. I picked it up and managed to get through the first 3 chapters with full attention! Strange! I started to get tired, so stupid me decides to take my Adderall because I didn't want to stop reading. To sum up, not only did I finish the entire book, but I ordered the next three in the series and read 2 of them in one day after they arrived! :) Never before had I ever even gotten through a book in a month, but I read 7 books in that one month, and 8 the next month and an average of 3 per week after that until I finished the entire series. This was nearly 10 years ago, and now that I think about it, I'm going to read them all again. :) By the way, the book series was Anita Blake Vampire Hunter by Laurell K Hamilton. Check it out.. Its way better than the typical trendy, teen type vampire love stories. These books came out long before Twilight and they're way more realistic. They're also for adults, not kids and teens. No, I'm not trying to sell this book series by using affiliate marketing strategies lol, I'm being 100% honest :)  ",
