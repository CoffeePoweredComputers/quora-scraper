            "answer_text": "Well\u2026.. World War One was one of the deadliest conflicts in the history of the human race, in which over 16 million people died. The total number of both civilian and military casualties is estimated at around 37 million people. The war killed almost 7 million civilians and 10 million military personnel. How Many People Died in WW1? - History Over 60 million people died in World War II. Estimated deaths range from 50-80 million. 38 to 55 million civilians were killed, including 13 to 20 million from war-related disease and famine World War II casualties - Wikipedia As you can see, the numbers are staggering. And one must remember that there are probably alot of deaths that were unaccounted for in these figures. Anyway you look at it though, you can draw the conclusion that A LOT of people died. I could be wrong but I believe in WWI alone something like 3% of the population died. That may seem small but when you take into account that is 3% of the world population, the numbers become extraordinary. ",
