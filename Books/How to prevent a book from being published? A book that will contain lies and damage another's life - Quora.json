            "answer_text": "What you are describing might be criminal: a book cannot state that a person committed a crime that they were not convicted for. That is considered libel. If that\u2019s what is happening, the legal department will notice. If they don\u2019t, you can file an injunction. But short of accusing you of a crime you didn\u2019t provably commit, there is a lot of grey area. I would challenge you a little bit here. Everyone feels a little bit threatened by another\u2019s perspective and it often does not perfectly line up with our own. I\u2019ve been on both sides of this issue quite a bit both as an author and as a publisher and as the subject of other people\u2019s work. I think the most important thing you can do, which is fortunately within your locus of control, is make peace with what\u2019s being said and take the time to understand the other person\u2019s perspective. Own the parts of what is being said that you can take responsibility for in your mind. Look at what they are saying objectively rather than as a condemnation. Can you see how they perceive the situation that way? Is there a value to the work for people outside of your family or personal relationships? Allowing someone to have their perspective while you have yours can go a long way towards healing. ",

They\u2019ll cut the material. You can have a defamation-specializing attorney contact the author, and require that they cease and desist publishing any material containing the errors. ",
