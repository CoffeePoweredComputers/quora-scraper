            "answer_text": "As other answers have noted\u2014a sale of a single book to a library ultimately results in a single unit of royalty to the author from the publisher. However this is not only not unfair to authors\u2014it is often advantageous to them. Here\u2019s why . . . Multiple people can borrow a book from the library one-at-a-time and no additional royalty results. But for a popular new book, libraries buy more than one copy and more than one royalty unit is accounted. A library might buy 5 or 10 or more copies of a current book to circulate. In the case of a bestseller in a public library in a big city, potentially many more.A library usually buys only one copy of a book and several patrons check it out over the course of its time in the library. But similarly, a retail customer may buy a copy, read it, then sell it or trade it to a used bookstore. Subsequent sales of the same copy of a book incur no additional royalty.It\u2019s not uncommon that books in a library are purchased and stocked but rarely checked out. Everyone knows the book The Education of Henry Adams which was self-published by the author in 1907. A college professor friend of mine found, in his college library, another title by the same author. In those days the entire history of a library book\u2014including the date it was acquired and the dates and names or initials of all past borrowers\u2014were recorded on a card in a pocket at the back of the book. My friend was the first person to ever check out this book, more than 50 years after the library acquired it.Libraries pay more for the books they buy than other classes of bulk buyers of books. A few years ago, bookstores generally received about a 40% discount from the retail price. Libraries received only a 10% discount. So libraries were actually putting proportionately more money into the publishing ecosystem even though they had the same magnitude of costs\u2014employees, real estate, building, utilities, etc. By contrast, book clubs buy large quantities of books at a \u201clong discount\u201d\u2014maybe 70%\u2014and many publishing contracts state that books sold by the publisher at a very long discount incur no royalty at all. And remaindered books incur no royalty. So libraries in that respect are pulling their own weight.Finally, and most importantly\u2014having your book in a library helps sell more books. When a book is borrowed from a library the borrower talks about it to friends, buys copies as gifts, maybe buys a copy to own after they return the library copy. A single copy of a book in a library might result in hundreds of sales of the book. I used to send a free copy of all our poetry books to the poetry reading room of the London Arts Council. I always saw a spike in sales of the book coming from the UK after that. Libraries are a promotional tool worth much more to authors than a few additional royalty payments.",

            "answer_text": "Public libraries pay for the copies of books they purchase. Royalties are paid by the publishers of the books. They hold the publishing contracts with the authors, which may vary for each. For public and academic libraries some publications, depending on the subject matter, may have subscription pricing, such as for annals, compendiums and proceedings, which are published at intervals, such as quarterly or annually. Then there is the licensing of online subscriptions paid for access to professional, technical and scientific journals and publications, which has become a worldwide disaster for libraries. In these cases, a conglomerate publisher, such as Elsevier or Kluwers, holds the licensing rights to key materials required by professionals to do their work. Ironically, it is these same professionals who write the materials included in the journals, but rather than get a \"royalty\" for the use of their work, they must pay each year to access their materials online. Stunning, right? They produce it, usually submitting the papers to the publication for peer review (a process also performed for free by fellow scientists.) After any necessary editing or corrections as a result of peer review, the paper is published. Now they have to pay to access it. Many academicians are revolting against this form of licensing, and opting for \"Open Access\" Public Library Of Science scientific publishing, in which authors publish to a shared cooperative portal or website that promises not to charge a fee for viewing. This accelerates discovery by making resources available to all researchers, regardless of affiliation or ability to pay. Standard licensing keeps knowledge distribution limited to those in \"first world\" countries, who can afford the exorbitant fees. ",
