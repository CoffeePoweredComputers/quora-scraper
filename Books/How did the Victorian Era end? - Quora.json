            "answer_text": "The answer is quite simple , it ended with the death of the queen herself . All the richest stge empire had accumulated during her reign and during the reign of the wise prime ministers Disraeli and Gladstone . The wise leaders were very efficient in the dealing of the empire . Moreover , being a widow , Victoria was much more engaged in running the country , as it was a deprive for her , to get away from the world. Her son Edward, though, was neither intelligent , nor did he any efficient ministers. The empire began crumbling in his reign . He rushed in his own stylish and fast paced Edwardian era , which was as different from Victorian age as beer is from champagne . His negligence to the country destroyed the reputation of the empire and he spent away all the riches of the great empire during his short reign ",

            "answer_text": "There are two answers: The era died with the queen in 1901. You can\u2019t have a Victorian era without Queen Victoria.Although the queen lived on, the confident and assertive tone and atmosphere of her era died with the setbacks of the Boer Wars, especially the three major defeats of the Black Week in December, 1899. (The Battles of Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Colenso.)Although the UK won the wars, the defeats were of such a major nature to cast a doubt on the ability of the \u201cestablishment\u201d of its day to govern effectively. Although Queen Victoria lived on, the social and political tone of the nation changed, especially as the queen\u2019s health declined. ",
