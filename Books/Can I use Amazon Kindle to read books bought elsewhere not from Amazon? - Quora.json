            "answer_text": "Kindle requires mobi files. There are a number of ways to convert files to mobi. Amazon has Kindle Gen https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211 It does require you to boss your DOS, but not that much. I convert my fiction epub files from Scrivener into a mobi file and upload the mobi to my Kindle with the same cord that I use to recharge the Kindle. The USB end of the plug goes into your computer/laptop that has the mobi file, and the micro usb goes into the Kindle. That makes your Kindle a storage device. I copy the mobi file I made with Kindle Gen and paste it into the Kindle \u201cDoc\u201d folder. It then shows up in my \u201cDoc\u201d section of my Kindle. Once you get the hang of converting any document into a mobi file the whole process takes just a couple of minutes. At first it\u2019s a bit hair raising. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Get Calibre freeware. It reads epub files and is my secondary e-reader for non-kindle books. It\u2019s updated a lot and I do donate to the site though the download is free. At this point, I have more books in Calibre than Kindle. The software author pronounces it \u2018caliber\u2019 like a weapon, not ca- LEE-bray the Latin or Spanish pronunciation. Apparently, he was educated in the UK or in British English and like \u2018centre\u2019 vs American \u2018center\u2019, the \u2019er\u2019 order is reversed. ",
