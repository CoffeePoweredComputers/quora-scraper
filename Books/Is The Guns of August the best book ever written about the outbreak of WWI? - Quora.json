            "answer_text": "It is a great book, well researched and gracefully written. It is still a very valuable source. But since it was published in 1962, additional resources have become available, especially in regards to the eastern front (as a result of the fall of communism). So those who are studying this era need to consult more recent works to get a true picture. It is likely to be the case that the newer works will not be as easy and pleasant to read as Tuchman, but will contain information not available to her. She was also criticized for not sufficiently emphasizing some of the more aggressive actions and statements of some western statesmen. ",
