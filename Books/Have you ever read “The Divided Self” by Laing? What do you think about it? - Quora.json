            "answer_text": "R.D. Laing was part of a progressive movement in psychiatry that has had, overall, a lasting and positive legacy in mental health. He and others helped transform many repressive and primitive practices existing in the first three quarters of the 20th century. \u201cLaing was revolutionary in valuing the content of psychotic behaviour and speech as a valid expression of distress, albeit wrapped in an enigmatic language of personal symbolism which is meaningful only from within their situation.\u201d \u2014Wikipedia This broke with the oppressive tradition in psychiatry to minimize the experience of schizophrenia and other manifestations of psychosis as irrelevant: \u201cIn 1913, psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers had pronounced, in his work, General Psychopathology, that many of the symptoms of mental illness (and particularly of delusions) were \u201cun-understandable\u201d, and therefore were worthy of little consideration except as a sign of some other underlying primary disorder.\u201d \u2014Wikipedia Laing should be lauded for giving meaning and \u201cunderstandability\u201d to psychosis as an idiosyncratic symbolic function. This was something that was dismissed by those before him. This was very damaging to patients needing supportive therapy, to be understood. For this Laing should be credited as being part of a progressive psychiatric movement that made significant inroads into reducing a dehumanizing approach to psychosis. However, on the minus side, he appears to have been too dismissive of the biological importance of mental disorders. Likely this was due to his living and writing during a time when the nervous system was only just being understood to have significant structural and functional differences in folks diagnosed with mental illnesses. Correspondingly, psychotropic medication was more primitive in his time as well. The subtleties of the nervous system\u2019s synapses were barely understood and major tranquilizers were the drugs of choice to treat psychosis (thorazine, etc.). These were \u201csledge hammer\u201d medications compared to the more synaptic site specific medications of today. These clumsier medications would add to Laing\u2019s aversion to a biological approach. ",

            "answer_text": "What I think about \"The Divided Self\u201d by Laing is that it's an interesting piece of psychological research from some of the most radical psychoanalysts in the world. It focuses on the connection between love and emotion. Laing's ideas suggest that being unable to express your love/love in a romantic way affects your ability to find positive emotional expression in a relationship and hence your success rate. The reason he says it is that the people who lack this \"Cinderella\" quality in love generally have their own adversity, sadness, difficulties, and severe disappointment due to which they may feel not as good as they should.
