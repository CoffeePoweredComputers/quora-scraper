            "answer_text": "Let me begin by stating that affairs don\u2019t just happen like that. There is always a natural progression that leads to infidelity. Yes, there are some people who have it in their genes to cheat but often, there is always a reason behind a partner to cheat. Cheating is more common among husbands than wives. Creating intimacy in a marriage is not easy. This intimacy in marriage is not just sexual, the husband and the wife have a deep emotional connection. Couples need to be valued and appreciated and when they do not receive validation at home, then problems start arising. When security, honor, and intimacy are removed from a marriage, then couples look for them somewhere else. That starts building room for infidelity. Most relationship experts say that one of the main drivers of infidelity is to feel good at any given moment, regardless of the relationship status. Such people do not give importance to the fact that they should be faithful to their partner. They just want to feel entitled to sex. Apart from this, there are lots of other reasons why infidelity happens such as: When a person is insecureWhen a person feels unworthy of being with their partner, they always worry about their partner\u2019s continued interest level. They need reassurance and approval from their partner on almost everything. Such a person starts seeking affirmations and reassurance from others. Sometimes, the fear of losing your partner can also induce you to cheat. In short, the lack of confidence of one partner shakes the foundation of the entire relationship. When your physical needs are not being metThis could happen in case of a man or woman. The desire for sexual satisfaction is a sign that it either lacks or is completely absent in the present relationship. It is not just the search for physical gratification that impels a man to be unfaithful but also a strong desire for new sexual experiences. A person\u2019s personality and beliefs largely impact on their reasons to cheat. For women, it is mostly because they felt ignored or did not get love from their partition. There are some things that couples should know about infidelity: It is not always a deal breakerTo be honest, you can never find a partner who is truly faithful. If they don\u2019t cheat physically, they will cheat emotionally. So, I would say cheating is not a signal that a marriage should end. Your marriage can survive after cheating too if you take it as an experience to grow. This does not mean that affairs are good for a marriage. They can be extremely destructive and they can break the trust too. Couples have to go through years and years of therapy to make it right and get back the trust, care, and passion. Most of the affairs end Even if the affair was addictive, sexually appealing, compelling, it will eventually end. It is usually not love but infatuation that makes you focus on only the good and such infatuations are always short lived. When reality sets in, the affair dies a natural death. But that does not mean if you find out your husband is cheating, you let them carry on. There needs to be an intervention. You are not aloneTrust me when I say that you are not alone. There are countless people like you who are suffering because of their partner\u2019s betrayal. There is a great deal of support available for people who have walked in the same shoes as you. Reach out to them and seek their empathy. You could really use a shoulder to cry on that can understand what you are going through. Get helpGet professional help because you will definitely break down. The feelings that surface after discovering affair can be very overwhelming. Getting your life back on track would seem like an impossible task. You might feel numb in the beginning but as days go by, you will want to scream. The only way out is through so see a marriage counselor. Get individual therapy as well as couples therapy if you must. You need to understand why this happened and how can both of you recover and trust each other again. Don\u2019t tell your friends and familyThe worst thing you could ever do is tell your friends or family that your partner betrayed you. They will simply pressure you to leave them. Yes, you deserve better but right now, you need to pick yourself up and fix things. If your unfaithful partner resents what they have done and take full responsibility for their mistakes and promise to change as well, then there is hope. Try to forgiveForgetting what happened can be hard. You may not be able to get over it your entire life but if you really want to do yourself a favor, then forgive them. I am not asking to forgive them right away but do forgive over time. ",

            "answer_text": "There can be a number of reasons for extra-marital affairs. Remember also that happy people (in the relationship) also cheat. From all the studies and research available on infidelity, there are two models of looking at the causes - Deficiency or \u201caffair is a symptom of a problem\u201d model - Where we try to look at all the things that were deficient in the relationship. Lack of intimacy, lack of communication, etc, fall into this. If applying the deficiency model to the relationship doesn\u2019t work, it is applied to the person. The person who cheated is narcissistic or selfish, etc.The other model dismisses the premise that an affair means a flawed relationship and instead focuses on the individual reasons why happy people also cheat. This means understanding that there may not be something wrong with the relationship but the partner straying may be unhappy with their own self or longing for something more or else.Further, each case is different and nuanced and hence listing reasons here is more or less like listing the reasons of a divorce. It could be one or a combination of a lot of reasons. The reasons that I will speak about here are factors that affect people and not the sure and certain cause of an affair. This means acknowledging the fact that almost always the partner straying is making a choice instead of dealing with the situation another way.  Firstly, an extra-marital affair is an imperfect solution to a problem. It is a sort of unethical compromise. What are the reasons of extra-marital affairs? The reason is humans are fallible and are fully capable of acting out of self interest at the cost of others, sometimes. The reason is that humans, in certain situations when they feel like they do not have a way out, indulge in deceit and lying. That broadly, is the main reason. Having said that, certain situations are such that extra-marital affairs feels like a way out to many. Based on my experience of dealing with this issue, I have come across the following very very often- Lack of communication - Most of the cases I have seen involve the lack of open and free communication. May couples have never had any kind of communication about sex, the quality of it, their satisfaction or dissatisfaction, their desires, needs, etc. Having such a communication would mean there is something lacking in your partner. Not many are willing to openly listen to that and address it. In countries where there is an inherent imbalance between a husband and wife, the gap increases.Lack of intimacy / sexual intimacy - Sex is often the physical expression of chemistry/intimacy. If that doesn\u2019t exist, people\u2019s sexual life suffers. Here too, not being open enough to communicate affects.A feeling of being lost / having suffered a loss - Studies after studies have pointed out that often, at the base of an affair is loss. Loss of a loved one, or a sense of loss. This kind of loss makes people question a lot of their basics.Expectations and a life lived for others - Often people are raised with extremely high expectations and they strive to be the \u201cideal son/daughter / idea wife / ideal husband / ideal parent/ ideal everything\u201d without giving a thought to what they truly want. An affair becomes a way of doing that. A sense of freedom from constraints. If this isn\u2019t enough, there is also the expectation from the other!Lack of experience - A lot of people do not have experience in dealing with romance, attraction, sexuality, communication and other skills that are important to handle a matured relationship like marriage. The are never taught the skills. What is more, they have never spoken about their sexuality. So, once you feel attracted to another and have the desire to stray, whom are you going to talk about it?Not feeling desired - One of the basic misconceptions about affairs is that it is about sex. It is not. More than that, it is about feeling desired. This is one of the primary reasons why happy people in good relationships also cheat.Lastly, the dichotomy of stability versus adventure - One partner cannot give you both. And it is often this, that is attractive about an affair.All this and more are some of the reasons of affairs. ",
