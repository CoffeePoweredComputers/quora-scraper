            "answer_text": "The Kindle Owners' Lending Library is available for free to Amazon Prime members, and can only be accessed with Kindle branded devices, though you can access the borrowed book on any and all such devices registered to you.  You may borrow one book, audiobook or magazine at a time - if you try to borrow again before you've returned the previous item you will be reminded to do so. You may keep what you've borrowed as long as you like. If your Amazon Prime membership lapses, you will not have access to the items you've borrowed. Amazon claims 'hundreds of thousands of books, some of them bestsellers' are available, but also that books may be added or removed from the rental program without warning. In that way it is similar to Netflix's streaming service. ",
