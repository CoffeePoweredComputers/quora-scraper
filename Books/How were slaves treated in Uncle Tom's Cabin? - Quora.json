            "answer_text": "When Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin she sought to give readers an unprecedented view of slavery through a bird\u2019s eye view. She wanted her Northern readers to be convinced of the necessity of ending slavery. She wanted the evils of slavery to be shown. The book had a major influence on the way the American public viewed slavery. Tom had 3 slave masters. The first two, Shelby and St. Claire are good people. They\u2019re portrayed as good people involved in a bad institution. Even though they are not cruel to the slaves, they still suffer just by being enslaved. The 3rd, the famed Simon Legree was brutal and cruel. His inhumanity to the slaves really highlights the evils of slavery to the reader. It should be noted that the slaves themselves are portrayed in a very positive light. ",
