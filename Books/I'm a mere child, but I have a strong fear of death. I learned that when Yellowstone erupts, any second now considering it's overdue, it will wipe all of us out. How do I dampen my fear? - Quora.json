            "answer_text": "Answered 20 January, 2020 My daughter drew this when she was four. She described it as: \u201cYellowstone blowing up and me being real sad.\u201d I was happy to reassure her it\u2019s not going to happen within weeks or hours as seen on television.  Jesse Lee O\u2019Connor \u674e\u6770\u897f's answer to Is Yellowstone Caldera really as dangerous as it is in movies? I\u2019m so very sorry that people have put in your head that a super-eruption of the Yellowstone hot spot is overdue. While none of us can be absolutely certain of natural disasters, I wish to assure you that no real scientists believe it\u2019s either overdue nor that it could happen any day, let alone any second. It\u2019s also a shame that well-meaning other answerers only concentrated on our powerlessness and the greater likelihood of other means of death than from Yellowstone. But science is a tool you can count on for understanding which is more powerful than fear There\u2019s a big area underneath Yellowstone that nervous people will tell you is packed full of melted rock just straining to burst upwards and ruin the whole world. This is not true. How big is the magma chamber under Yellowstone? It has 4,000 [cu.] km (960 cu mi) underground volume, of which [only] 6\u20138% is filled with molten rock Yellowstone Caldera - Wikipedia Its simply not ready to erupt, even if you tunneled down to it or dropped the biggest bomb ever on it or even a space rock. (An asteroid impact would be more destructive than a super eruption.) Before a large eruption is possible, it would need decades, 20, 30, 40 or more years of changes they can measure and see what\u2019s happening before there\u2019s any danger of that. Why you can stop worrying Yellowstone's supervolcano is about to end the world I\u2019m very sorry that bad people, for motivations unknown, have stirred up so many with rumours and falsehoods not supported by real-world physics and evidence. Real science is what you can measure, what you can repeat and what you can maybe disprove. Spreading fear without evidence is nothing more than gossip. It is unethical to go into a crowded theater and yell \u201cfire.\u201d The doom mongers either have poor math skills or no regard for reason but only wish to spread malcontent. They say, \u201cYellowstone has erupted every 600,000 years. It\u2019s been 631,000 since the last one. It\u2019s overdue!\u201d Please count with me: 2,100,000 years minus 1,300,000 years equals 800,000 years1,300,000 minus 631,000 equals 669,000 yearsThey can\u2019t count the third interval as 631,000 years because it\u2019s not erupting now and it can\u2019t erupt to form a caldera for decades, most say not for thousands of years from now. (A small eruption that wouldn\u2019t hurt the planet could happen sooner.)Here\u2019s the easiest math: 2,100,000 divided by 3 equals 700,000 average years between the last three big eruptions and that only works if it\u2019s erupting right now. Go back further in time: 13 big, caldera-forming eruptions in 16,500,000 years yields an average of 1,269,231 years between them, if it goes off now.

            "answer_text": "There are so many ways death could come, but I will tell you a secret. The things we worry about are seldom the events that occur. You might be obsessing about Yellowstone, but meanwhile there\u2019s a troubling flu of some sort unfolding in China that could become a plague. And apparently being hit with a giant asteroid is much likelier than I ever realized. Truthfully, you stand a better chance of being hit by a random drunk driver than going by any of these means. So. You have to get ahold of yourself and control what you can, such as getting an annual flu shot, and then you have to go about your business. Spending your life worrying over what you can\u2019t control will make you and those around you unhappy and will impede your delight in living your one wild and precious life. Cast aside your fears and live with passion and daring. Have fun every day you\u2019re privileged to walk on this planet. Think of ways to help others so you keep your mind off of yourself. Exercise every day. Eat healthy foods, no junk. Forget about Yellowstone, about which you can do nothing. Defend someone from a bully. Help an old lady cross a street. Be the amazing person you already are. love and luck \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf40 ",
