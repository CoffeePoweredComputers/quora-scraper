            "answer_text": "In almost all cases, absolutely NOT.  You can apply for a \"researcher's card\" at the LC which gives you on-site access to its resources.   You can ask for a \"shelf\" on which to keep the materials you've requested for multi-day use and some scholars are allocated small cubicles to do their research in which they can keep LC resources during their studies. The LC uses barcodes and other tracking tools to determine the location of its holdings in its facilities, so they know to which researcher an item has been lent. Officers with the Library of Congress Police inspect bags, briefcases, etc. as people exit the building to ensure nothing in the LC collection leaves with them. With the possible exception of legislators, you simply can't take materials from the LC premises.  I cannot think of a good reason why a Representative or Senator would want to \"take books out of the LC.\"  It's a research library (more specifically, its a collection of research libraries, see Home ), not a general purpose \"circulating library\" like the one in your hometown.
