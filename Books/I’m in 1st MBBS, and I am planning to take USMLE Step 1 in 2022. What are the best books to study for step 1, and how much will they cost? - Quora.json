            "answer_text": "Thanks for request. As per my knowledge and my opinion, start preparing from 1st year itself without any concepts that will give you burden only. So I will try to give you answers in particular manner. Check it. So let's get started. Focus on 1st proff subjects now. 1st focus to build concepts. Not mugging up and just reading like this stuff.Read Standard books 1st. Don't think wheather it will be useful or not. Just read standard books. For Anatomy Read BDC or if possible then read Gray's anatomy. But I prefer to read BDC and along with watch Kaplan anatomy videos and watch youtube anatomy videos to clear your basics and build up the strong base for future castle. Follow Netter anatomy flash cards if possible. Acland anatomy videos are awesome.For physiology Najeeb is THE BEST. watch all videos and revise it as much as possible. And for Neuro part najeeb only is enough one to build better concepts. Read AK Jain and Guyton or Ganong. ( Ganong as per my opinion ) Please Don't read Sembulingum. Ya it is good for University exam crack. ( ITS LIKE APPLE MOBILE AND NOKIA MOBILE. BOTH ARE USEFUL BUT ALL HAS ITS OWN PLUS POINT \ud83d\ude09 ) Prepare physiology at A1 level. It will give you ton of help in medicine and other subjects in future.For Biochemistry Kaplan Dr.Turco lectures are awesome. Even if in future you willing to prepare for PG then also it will be helpful. Read Vasudevan and refer Lippincott cards. That are awesome.Now along with it follow Kaplan notes with Kaplan videos. Because that will help you to make the concepts and understanding easier. Don't read First aid from 1st year itself. Read from 2nd year onwards. For some books :- Kaplan notes , Pretest Subject wise MCQ bank, For anatomy follow Thieme book dissection and do dissection more and more and try to visualise with your theory concepts. Now for cost\u2026 Whole USMLE truely speaking you will get cost of around 7 lakhs minimum to 10 lakhs maximum. ( May be plus But not possible in 3 to 4 lakhs for sure ) And along with solve Kaplan qbank mcqs ( PDFs are available ) and read uworld after your 1st internal exam. I use the word READ for uworld. Because after reading you will get more and more new one. Just make notes of i\ud83d\udc4dDon't think that all mcqs you have to do right. Just understand it\ud83d\udc4d Dhaval Shah's answer to I scored a NEET PG rank of 4k without studying. I also got a 260 on the USMLE step 1 (prepared for USMLE). I am an intern right now. Should I take the seat? Read this answer that I gave before\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Feel free to ask me for study related queries. Hope you will get your answer.\ud83d\udc4d I explain about 1st year books. Because you are in 1st year so. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d ",

A proper coordination between subjects will help not only for steps but also will make you a better doctor. You can follow UFAP regime for serious preparation for Step 1 just before the exam. U- Uworld F- First Aid P- Pathoma You can also add Boards and Beyond videos as they are really helpful. From Kaplan, follow Biochemistry by Dr. Turco and Anatomy by Dr. White. They are just awesome. You can get all the resources in USMLE groups on Facebook or other sources like Google drive. You can also buy the original resources from their respective websites as I will not promote piracy. Also, try to give self assessment tests for your progress until you get into the range of your desired score. I feel this is enough for a good score in Steps. ",
