            "answer_text": "As of now, no one can give a guarantee of the difficulty of the IISER Aptitude Test 2020. So at best, there can be speculation. While some variation in difficulty is observed every year, more or less, the levels remain fairly constant. So extending that comparison to this year too, the difficulty level is expected to be fairly similar to that of previous years. And that is a reasonable estimate. And yes, the delay in the conduction of the exam has no bearing on the difficulty of the exam. This is because the questions are set months in advance from the original exam date, and thus were more or less finalised by around March-April. So do not worry about the difficulty levels. Focus on your preparation, sleep well, eat good food, and take care. Good luck! ",

As the eligibility cutoffs have been lowered significantly you can expect a diverse set of people appearing for this year test.COVID situation makes it difficult to appear for the examinations and many will skip the entrance, resulting in lesser competition.However, the standard of the paper is likely to remain same as the previous year.
