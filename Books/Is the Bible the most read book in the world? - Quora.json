            "answer_text": "I am going to give my answer because I think its going to surprise a lot of people. I do not believe the Bible is the most widely read book in the world or at least in the US for a series of reasons. First I believe a book is more likely to be \u201cRead\u201d when the person who has the book goes in to the bookstore, takes the book on the counter and buys the book with money. Now here is the thing most of the time this is not the case with the Bible, more than likely if you have a Bible in the US it was given to you be either a friend or a relative. Secondly, most people who own Bibles seldom own just one Bible, my grandmother had at least 30. You go into a church or a hotel room and then they have at least one in every room . The Bible is not copyrighted so you can stand on the street corner handing it out to people. You can also find it online for free. Distributed and read are two different things. Now your going to be surprised at what I think is the most widely read if not quoted book in the us, The Guiness Book of world records, why you ask ? Because it breaks its own record as the most distributed copywritten book. This means that people actually went in to a bookstore and brought the book, Also, without realizing it we actually quote the book more than we realize in our everyday conversation, So who is the richest manWhat is the tallest mountainDid you know they made something that can go faster than that?Have they done that yet?No, this happened first?Did you know they found a place on earth that does that more than anyone elseThese are all conversations that get resolved with the Guinness book ",

            "answer_text": "Hi All, Here is my opinion based on facts and partly on assumptions. I hope the below estimations show that the Quran is in fact the most read book. First of all everything you've said about the Bible is exactly the same but for the Quran. As there are almost as many Muslims as there are Christians around the world, using the same asumptions as you have, we would come to the conclusion that the Quran is almost read just as much; but in fact it is read much more.. Just consider that Muslims have to pray and read chapters from the Quran in their prayers everyday. Muslims have to recite \u2018Chapter 1\u2032 a staggering 17 times a day in these prayers through the 17 units of prayer performed each day and at least one other chapter a further 10 times a day. Thats 27 times a day and that is only the compulsory recitations. Assuming there are 2 billion Muslims and if only 10% perform these prayers, still means the Quran is read 5.4 billion times a day. If we assume 50% of Muslims keep up with all their prayers then the figure becomes 27 billion times a day, which is more realistic, but let\u2019s stick to your 10%. So 5.4 billion times a day. And so far that is only the compulsory. Then millions of more devout Muslims read passages from the Quran hundreds of times a day for different reasons (duas/invocations) and many people aim to completely read the Quran at least once every month reading a \u2018part' a day. Furthermore every day at the funeral services taking place around the world in Muslim communities more prayers from the Quran are recited. Thats every single day all around the world and each of these are attended by dozens if not hundreds of Muslims. Also whenever a sick person is visited passages from the Quran are recited again. Every time we drive a motor vehicle or set on a journey whether it be by foot or by plane or any mode of transport, we recite a desgnated verse from the Quran. I can really keep going on and on. In summary, I do not think that the Bible comes ANYWHERE near the Quran in this argument. It is not even a fair contest going by these modest assumptions. Furthermore I think and its a fact that many non Muslims do in fact read the Quran although you have stated it does not work the other way. If so many non Muslims did not read the Quran there would not be so many people who claim to have read the Quran or know what it supposedly contains or the message it supposedly teaches. Ok now assuming that only 10% of Muslims do all the \u2018extras' above, and assuming that these people recite the Quran only a further 5 times a day in addition to the compulsory, although I bet it is much more, thats 2bilx 5 = 10 bil x 10% = 1 billion. So 1 billion more times a day. So in total, in addition to the compulsory recitations we get a figure of at least 6.4 billion times a day every day I simply dont think any book can top these stats. Please prove otherwise. ",
