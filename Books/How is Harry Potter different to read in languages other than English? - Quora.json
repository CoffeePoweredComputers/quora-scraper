            "answer_text": "The Finnish translator Jaana Kapari-Jatta is very talented and she managed to translate every peculiar word retaining the right atmosphere. One of the best is the anagram Tom Marvolo Riddle > I am Lord Voldemort that becomes Tom Lomen Valedro > Ma olen Voldemort. The phrase means 'I am Voldemort' with a poetic personal pronoun. Tom remained because it was important that the character had a regular first name. To form the anagram, the middle name had to be changed and she created a weird name as in the original to fit into the anagram. The last name has a meaning so the remaining letters must be able to form some kind of meaning. Riddle means 'mystery' or 'enigma' and the translation contains the word vale that means 'a lie'. Together with dro it sounds like a foreign surname. I think that's a brilliant translation (though, I didn't realise this when I read the books).  Other names with meanings were translated, too. Quirrel became Orave (orava = squirrel) and Snape became Kalkaros to retain the association with snake (although the author may not have meant that). There are many others of course.  Cultural references are not changed because the story is located in a certain culture. However, Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley became Weasleyn is\u00e4 ('Weasley's father') and Weasleyn \u00e4iti ('Weasley's mother') because Finns don't call each other with Mr. and Mrs. that would sound odd in Finnish.
