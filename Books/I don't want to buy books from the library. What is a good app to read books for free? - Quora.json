            "answer_text": "First, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by having to \u201cbuy\u201d books from the library\u2026 the whole point of having a library (public libraries in the USA anyway) is that you can check things out for free. Do you mean buying ebooks from bookstores? Or do you mean you don\u2019t want to check out physical books, and would rather have digital access? Your library might already be doing just that! My library gives me free access to OverDrive and Hoopla via my library card, no fees, no cost, just a quick registration and a couple of reasonable limitations (eg, no more than 5 items out at a time). Since I belong, legitimately, to several libraries, I get access to all their digital collections. I get ebooks, audiobooks, magazines, TV shows, movies, etc that all check themselves back in automatically, so no overdue fees ever. Also the apps keep track of what I\u2019ve checked out, if I choose to have that setting, so I can always re-check out something I want to re-read, or add it to favorites to save the title. Ask your local library if they provide access to this service, or something similar (a lot do! in North America at least; not sure about Europe, Asia, Australia, etc but I have to believe there\u2019s *something* similar there, if not these services). If they do not, ask them to look into it\u2014and make sure they let you know what their decision is, and why. If you don\u2019t have a library card, a lot of libraries will let you ask for one online nowadays, if a physical branch is difficult to gain access to. Can\u2019t hurt to ask. Other options that are legit and won\u2019t violate copyrights include: \u2014do a search on your preferred store site (Amazon, B&N, BAM, Kobo, whatever) for the books available for free that day. You can select \u201call ebooks\u201d and then put in order by price Low<High, or limit by price from $0.00 to $0.00, or limit by genre THEN by price; \u2014sign up for the BookBub email which sources out items that are cheap or free AND that are upward-trending titles every day (most are $0-$5); \u2014check out Project Gutenberg which has thousands of public-domain titles available; \u2014ask for gift cards to your favorite place to get ebooks on gift-giving occassions. Other peoople buying books for you=free to you ;) \u2014find a friend who has an Amazon account and the two of you can \u201cloan\u201d purchased ebooks to one another, to a point. It\u2019s not quite \u201cfree\u201d but it does spread the cost out some. I\u2019m an avid reader, so my public library is a great resource for me. And I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve talked to that had NO IDEA our library has thousands and thousands of ebooks available, with more all the time. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It is completely fine if you do not want to buy books from the library.
