            "answer_text": "Yes it is possible to buy books without paying a single penny for them. But they come with a few caveats. Firstly, free books are usually available online and not in hard copy. There are exceptions of course. For e.g. a religious organisation may distribute books about their teachings for free. However, the books available in hard copy for free are limited. In the digital world, several e-book readers allow you to legally buy books at no cost. Check out Kindle reader, iBooks and other reading apps for their inventory of free books. The books that will be available for free will fall broadly into two categories. Classics - books that were written eons ago where the author has passed away and the copyright period has expired. These include a treasure trove of wonderful books that can be easily downloaded and read on e-readers at no cost.Marketing materials - these are usually books written either by a brand or company trying to use the book as a marketing tool for their services. For e.g. a social media platform may publish an e-book to detail out how the platform can be used beneficially for small business owners. They are a mixed bag and some can be really useful for their target audiences.New authors - may want to publish their books and get feedback from readers and hence they make their books available for \u201csale\u201d at no cost.Other than this, you can participate in giveaways by authors, publishers or platforms like Goodreads and get books delivered to you for free if you win. Happy reading! ",
