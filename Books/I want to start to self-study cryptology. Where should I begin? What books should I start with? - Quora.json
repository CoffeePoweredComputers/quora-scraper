            "answer_text": "The most important resource in studying cryptology is history. Cryptology is a practical branch of mathematics that swings a heavy club when it comes to the course of history. It is deeply woven through the fabric of human endeavors. Start your study of cryptography with writing and breaking the Ceasar Cipher. Learn the trick of frequency analysis. Move on to the Vigenere Cipher. Learn about keys and key distrobution problems. Try your hand at frequency analysis with groups of letters. Read \"Cryptonomicon\" by Neal Stevenson to learn about the code breaking efforts in World War II. If you get the chance go to the Cryptological Museum at the NSA Headquarters in Fort Meade Maryland. Or Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom. Most technological advancements we've had come from cracking the Enigma and Purple Ciphers, and the Apollo Program. From studying the Enigma Machine you will learn about proper security procedures. From there learn about des, triple des, and aes. Learn about Diffie-Hellman, RSA and asymmetrical encryption. Play around with steganography. Cryptography is a continuous spy novel we are all apart of.  Read \"Secrets and Lies\" by Bruce SchneierI've found this to be one of the best information security introductions available. Read \"The Code Book\" by Simon Singh. It helped me pass the CISSP. Become a regular reader of Schneier's CryptoGram newsletter. Take Stanford University's Cryptology 1 for free on Coursera. Study as much probability and mathematics as you can.  There are a plethora of cryptography websites that will help you learn and play with the various cryptosystems. ",
