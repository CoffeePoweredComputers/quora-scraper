            "answer_text": "If you are an experienced reader that is you have been reading for years then you would know what environment suits you best. If not or if you are still trying to find the perfect surrounding for book reading then i suggest you try by giving solitude a chance.lock yourself in your room and get in your bed and start reading. don\u2019t sleep and read because then you\u2019ll be forced to change position a gazillion times! i don\u2019t know about you but i avoid eating something while reading because that just takes my mind off the topic at hand. while reading a novel or a story try to imagine the situation as you read it. it would happen naturally as you read further but don\u2019t force your imagination. while reading self help books try to analyse yourself first before you start reading and then do it again after every chapter or two chapters. you don\u2019t have to take written notes, you can underline the point and bookmark it. best way to increase efficiency is by associating a situation to a chapter. while reading any book try to keep your cellphone or laptop away from you or on silent mode. to look up meaning for a word you can always use pocket dictionary. to gain the best from any book, choose a book that suits you. you can research about it..

            "answer_text": "In my experience, I have understood that to read a book most effectively, what matter a lot are concentration and involvement. If we are completely into the book we read, it\u2019s impossible to forget even the lesser known fact. It also much depends upon the type of book we choose to read. If the book suits our own interests and if we had picked it up with much admiration to read it, we may read it in no time, simultaneously enjoying each and every facet of the book. ",
