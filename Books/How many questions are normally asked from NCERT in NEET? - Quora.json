            "answer_text": "see friend, the CBSE has designed NEET syllabus all over the country for single entrance test. So remember that they will ask min of 20% as it is from NCERT. Now in the remaining 80%, min of 60%will be from NCERT which will be conceptual. The remaining 20% will include some questions from different board syllabi. So all in all for BIO-you can expect minimum 80/90 will be from NCERT directly or indirectly. This year there were aprx 85 questions as various analysis; which caused many to score 550+. So read NCERT perfectly. Remember while reading you will get some words which you don\u2019t get;so take a dictionary and get its meaning. If you complete ncert thoroughly i am sure you will score 300+just through bio. for chemistry-read the ncert. note that you don't even leave the questions being askef after each chapter sometimes they include new things other than the chapter especially for organic. As this year most of questions where directly picked from ncert without any change. you can expect 25\u201330 from ncert. for physics-don\u2019t just read ncert because you will probably not get anything. So get a book note down the imp points and formula from ncert. understand the concept rather than memorizing and solve as many different types of problems. if you do this sincerely you will definitely understand physics. i know most people feel physics to be sleepy subject but once you understand and solve you will not give up even though you are sleepy. here there will not be direct question but they will have ncert concepts in max. you can expect 25-30. so you will end up with min of 320+120+120=560 which is definitely enough to get a decent medical college. given that you study ncert thoroughly. to secure the remaining you should work on exemplars which will give u extra knowledge. you should refer previous year papers. Some extra concepts from mtg or arihant or standard book which is related to ncert but never go out of ncert ;becoz one can\u2019t remember everything. note that you read the sentences beneath the diagrams also especially for bio. before reading any other books first become topper in ever point of NCERT. GOOD LUCK. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for a2a diganta. Now discuss your questions For biology As everyone says, NCERT is the must do book. Every year,out of 90 questions,85\u201388 questions come from NCERT.But out of 85, questions,75\u201380 are direct questions and you can solve them in minimum time if you have completed understand NCERT,the diagrams,,the summary and finally revise it a lot of times.Rest questions are confusing and required so many concepts. Even if you have read the NCERT you will mistake it. So for these questions,my suggestions is to go for Allen modules.For chemistry For, inorganic chemistry , every single question comes from NCERT. You can do them, if you are through with NCERT. This section carries 10\u201315 questions,all are from NCERT.For physical chemistry,the questions are mainly problem based. But some chapters like surface chemistry, states of matter etc every question comes from NCERT. This section contains 15 questions,out of which,8\u201310 are from NCERT.In organic chemistry, only a few questions come. This section covers 15\u201320 questions,out of which you can except,5 questions from NCERT.For physics IT is itself a challenge to read NCERT and requires immense patience.Some questions come part of the chapter like semiconductor, photo electric effect, communication, digital electronic etc. You can except 2\u20133 questions from NCERT.In physics papers, you can see most of problem based questions. Some problems come from NCERT example and exemplar book. But they're only 3\u20135. Not more than that.Finally all the best for your exams ",
