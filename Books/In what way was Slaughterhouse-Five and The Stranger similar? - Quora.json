            "answer_text": "You could say they were both dark novels but there wasn\u2019t much similarities even there. Vonnegut\u2019s novels were satirical and actually pretty funny. Of course Slauterhouse is about WW2 and somehow has time and space travel thrown into the plot, so you it\u2019s kind of a light read. On the other end The Stranger starts out dark, and gets darker till you reach the end. You are not going to find any satire or laughs in this story but IMO it\u2019s a much better novel ",
