            "answer_text": "You just have to prioritise your chapters and revise everything throughly. You must have made short notes, and that really helps alot, make sure you read them and memorize the examples(as of botany part). Read each and every line of NCERT very carefully as questions are framed from any of those lines, so make sure you are not forgetting that. Also, try to solve past year paper as well, so that you get a grip of what type of questions do come in the NEET and solve MCQ'S from books like MTG, where they also provide you with High Order Thinking Questions(MCQ'S) that basically helps you get a better picture of the questions that are to be asked. Make your concepts clear by revising what you're weak at, going through your notes or NCERT. Stronger your weak points and always remember NCERT is THE KEYY!!\ud83d\ude4f Don't wander anywhere else except for NCERT and your own hand written notes and MCQ'S. And that's all you need to do. You'll surely score more than you aim for(as you said 320+). All The Very Best for your exams. I heartedly hope you do the bestt\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f Namaste \u2764\ufe0f ",
