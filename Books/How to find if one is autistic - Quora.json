            "answer_text": "Do you think your quirkiness extends beyond social awkwardness? If so, you may be autistic. Autism is a highly complex neurological difference, but with thought and research, you can understand it. 1.Look at how you react to social cues. Autistic people have trouble understanding subtle social cues. Having trouble understanding how another person is feeling (e.g. wondering if they are too sleepy to talk or not)Being told that your behavior was inappropriate, and feeling very surprised to hear thisNot realizing that someone is bored of talking and wants to do something elseFrequently mystified by other people's behavior.2.Consider your responses to unexpected events. Scheduled changes in routine, unfamiliar new events, and sudden changes in plans all qualify. Do changes like this upset you? Do you feel especially anxious in new circumstances, or if the order of things is broken? Does it feel like nothing makes sense anymore? 3.Watch yourself to see if you stim. While everyone stims, it's especially important and frequent for autistic people. If you haven't been diagnosed yet, your stims may be on the more subtle side. Flapping or clapping handsRockingHugging yourself tightly, squeezing your hands, or piling heavy blankets on yourselfTapping toes, pencils, fingers, etc.Crashing into things for funPlaying with hairPacing, spinning, or jumpingLooking at bright lights, intense colors, or moving gifsSinging, humming, or listening to a song on repeatSmelling soaps or perfumesYou may have \"unlearned\" certain stims when people told you to stop. Consider if you did any of these during your childhood.4.Identify any sensory issues. Many autistic people have Sensory Processing Disorder ( also known as Sensory Integration Disorder), which means that the brain underreacts or overreacts to certain stimuli. Here are some examples: Sight\u2014Becoming overwhelmed by bright colors or moving objects, not noticing things like road signs, attraction to the sight of hustle and bustleHearing\u2014Covering ears or hiding from loud noises such as vacuum cleaners and crowded places, not noticing when people are talking to you, missing things that people saySmell\u2014Feeling disturbed or nauseated by smells that don't bother others, not noticing important smells like gasoline, loving strong scents and buying the strongest-smelling soaps and food availableTaste\u2014Preferring to eat only bland or \"kid food,\" eating extremely spicy and flavorful food while disliking anything bland, or disliking trying new foodsTouch\u2014Being bothered by certain fabrics or clothes tags, not noticing when people touch you lightly or you are injured, or constantly running your hands along everythingVestibular\u2014Getting dizzy on cars or swing sets, or constantly running around and climbing thingsProprioceptive\u2014Constantly feeling uncomfortable movements of your bones and organs, bumping into things, or not noticing when you are hungry or tired.5.Consider whether you experience meltdowns or shutdowns. Meltdowns, a fight-flight-or-freeze reaction which may be mistaken for tantrums in childhood, are explosions of emotion that occur when an autistic person can no longer keep stress bottled up. Shutdowns are similar in cause, but the autistic person instead becomes passive and may lose skills (such as speaking). You may view yourself as sensitive, hot-tempered, or immature.6.Consider your passions. Autistic people often have intense and peculiar passions, which are called special interests. Examples include fire trucks, dogs, quantum physics, autism, and that novel you've been working on since you were a teenager. Special interests are notable in their intensity. Here are some signs that your passion has reached autistic levels: Talking about your special interest for long periods of time, and wanting to share it with othersBeing able to concentrate on your passion for hours; losing track of timeOrganizing information for fun, such as charts, tables, and spreadsheetsBeing able to write/say long and detailed explanations of nuances of your interest, all off of the top of your head, perhaps even quoting passagesCorrecting experts in the fieldBeing wary of talking about your interest, for fear that you'll annoy people.7.Think about how easy it is for you to talk and process speech. Autism is often associated with difficulties in spoken language, the degree of which greatly varies from person to person. Did you learn to speak later in life (or not at all)? Do you sometimes lose the ability to form words when you feel upset or overwhelmed? Is it sometimes easier for you to use typing, gestures, sign language, picture boards, or behavior to communicate?Do you have a hard time turning your thoughts into spoken words? Have people ever remarked on long pauses in the conversation (especially in upsetting conversations)? Do you avoid difficult conversations because you aren't sure you'll be able to form coherent sentences or say something remotely resembling your main point?Is it hard for you to understand speech? Do you struggle to keep up while taking notes, and miss some things that your teacher/professor says? Do you forget things people tell you? Are you overwhelmed by a string of spoken directions? Does it take time to realize what someone said? (For example, they say \"Your book is about to fall,\" and by the time you realize that you should move, your book has hit the floor.)8.Examine your appearance. One study found that autistic children have distinct facial characteristics\u2014broad upper face, big wide-set eyes, a short nose/cheeks area, and a wide mouth\u2014in other words, somewhat of a \"baby face.\" You may look younger than your age or be told that you look attractive/adorable. Not every autistic child has each of these facial features.You may only have a few.Regards Shalini Selvan ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly it is very difficult to know because even researchers are not fully aware yet of who we are. I think what happens in general is that we feel different: Social differencesClumsy conversationNot caring about things that neurotypicals care aboutAnd we try to figure out why we don\u2019t have the same desire to socialize. Why our parents have to force us to call our friends. Or why we are clumsy physically and socially\u2026etc. Let me answer how I found out that I was autistic and eventually knew for sure. My whole life I felt like I was alone. Alone in my family, alone in the world. I was always obsessed with certain things like the colour purple. Martin even laughed the other day when I pulled out my running shoes\u2014yup purple.  I honestly did not know what adult autism looked like. I am not sure why it never occurred to me that children with autism grow up into adults with autism. I met Martin through his interactions on Quora and he suggested it to me. Laughable, I thought. After all, I had spoken to others about how to even communicate successfully with someone who had Asperger\u2019s; I didn\u2019t have\u2014or thought I have\u2014challenges in communication, so how could I be autistic? In addition, I purchased numerous books on the subject. Still I saw myself as neurotypical (but different). In the end I took the AQ and scored a whopping 39 on it. This led to me reading up more about the topic and seeking out a clinical diagnosis (2 in fact).  You can read up on autism by people on the spectrum\u2014research and personal experiences\u2014on our website, Embrace ASD.  Next let\u2019s look at the diagnostic criteria\u2026 The greatest challenge with figuring out if you are autistic is that the DSM makes it difficult to understand and interpret the language. Basically we have a few diagnostic criteria; let\u2019s translate them. A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication: So basically if you find that social communication and following social conventions is something you do, but prefer not to do; or use more formal language; or find that you are not great at following the proper signals for interaction such as you over talk or interrupt people; or take things literally, then you can check-mark this.  B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities Basically, do you do better with a routine or have special interests (things that you kind of get obsessive about?); do you stim (repeat a movement such as fiddling with keys, etc. to alleviate anxiety); and finally do you have sensory issues (find wool itchy/scratchy, get overheated, etc.). If so give, yourself a second purple checkmark.  C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life). Basically, were these symptoms present when you were a kid?  If yes checkmark 3! D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Do your symptoms cause problems with your life? Another yes?  Yup another checkmark. And finally\u2026 E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability This is pretty obvious\u2026  So if you got 5 checkmarks, or even 4\u2026then you may want to take the autism tests on the home page of Embrace ASD (scroll to the bottom).  Then I can list things that many of us have said: We feel different in some way.We mask.We have sensory issues.We are seen as blunt or rude.We have special interests.We need a lot of alone time.We dislike social events.We score over 26 on the ASQ.We may be naive.We get taken advantage of.And we also have awesome qualities such as being loyal, kind, honest, and we tend to be autodidacts and possess a wealth of information on certain topics. \u2014 And then obviously a diagnosis will confirm it.
