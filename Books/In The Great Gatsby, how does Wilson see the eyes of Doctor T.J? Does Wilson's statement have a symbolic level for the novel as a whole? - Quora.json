            "answer_text": "As Robert Girard mentioned, Wilson indeed sees the eyes of Doctor T. J. as the eyes of god. However the location is very interesting : it\u2019s on a billboard, which reflects the materialism and superficial lifestyle of society in the 1920\u2032s. This could mean that god get\u2019s replaced by consumerism and that he\u2019s losing his dominance as a result. But Fitzgerald\u2019s narration often seems to suggest that the objects (the eyes of Doctor T. J. in this case) only hold a meaning because characters inflict them with a meaning. ",
