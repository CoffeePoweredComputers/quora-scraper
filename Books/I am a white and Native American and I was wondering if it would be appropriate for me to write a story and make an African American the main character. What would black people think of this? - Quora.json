            "answer_text": "For me, the most important part about writing a character whom I have no real ties to other than friendships with people of the same race/ethnicity, is to remember that you will never know what it\u2019s like to be in that skin. You can do your research properly, talk to your friends, even interview a few people. But, the fact is, you\u2019ll never be able to know what that\u2019s like. Be mindful about what you talk about, and how you talk about it. Sometimes as I write, I tend to use my personal world views and opinions shine through my main character. Knowing this about myself, I tend to stick to Hispanic/white characters as my main ones. So, again, be mindful about how you write them, how you describe them, and how they interact with the world around them and how the world interacts with them. As far as how black people will react, that\u2019s a question I cannot answer. They might feel disconnected and maybe offended if you write the character in a stereotypical way. This is all the insight I can offer on this. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "That really depends on your motivation. Some things would be positive, like celebrating \u201cBlack\u201d culture, celebrating the unique shared history of some Native groups and \u201cBlacks\u201d, diversity and inclusion. It could be neutral, in that the character happens to have a dark skin tone far in a Post-\u201dRacial\u201d future. It could be negative, utilizing dark skin to symbolize a negative essence (the reason black the adjective was used originally to describe \u201cBlack\u201d people). So your motivation will dictate how this is seen. ",
