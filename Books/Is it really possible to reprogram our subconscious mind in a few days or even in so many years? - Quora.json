            "answer_text": "Yes! It is possible to reprogramme our Unconscious mind. How? Let us understand our mind first. Mind can be divided into Conscious Mind and Unconscious Mind. Conscious mind is 10% of our mind and it receives information from our 5 senses, processes and filters the information, which is then passed to our Unconscious mind. Unconscious mind acts like a storage device. It is imaginative, creative and emotional. It performs automatic responses and stores habits. Since Conscious Mind is limited, it relies on Unconscious mind for information. Also those movements we require frequently are made into automatic responses or habits and are stored in our Unconscious. Conscious mind has power to select the information and process it however once the information goes into Unconscious mind, it will not allow to change the information consciously. For example, if our parents found maths difficult in their school days, they may ask their chidren to focus on maths as it is difficult subject. This information once gone into Unconscious mind of a child, she would find maths difficult even if she has acumen to do it. This information is now difficult to change at conscious level. You can use visualization techniques to reprogramme your Unconscious mind. To know.more about visualization technique, please watch my video on youtube, link to the video is in my Quora profile. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is very much possible. Our emotions, our reactions to the events, our beliefs, judgements , perceptios all the reflections of the programming of SCM. Now if you observe closely our judgements, beliefs , emotional reactions towards same event or person keeps changing. To make it simple to understand, an accident can create driving phobia in the driver, it means that incident has reprogrammed his subconscious mind. Ad agencies , marketing companies and image managers also re write our subconscious about brand or person to get desired behavior from the masses. There are certain ways to access the SCM you may refer my previous answers on this platform to know more about them. ",
