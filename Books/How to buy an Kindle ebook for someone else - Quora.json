When you \u2018purchase\u2019 an e-book, you don\u2019t actually own it, you have just acquired a license to read it. A lot of people don\u2019t realise that. There is no way to transfer that license to another person or to leave it to your heirs. It doesn\u2019t belong to you. The only way you can buy an e-book for someone else is to do it as that person, using that person\u2019s device. ",

Your account gets charged, and they get an email telling them how to accept it into their account. ",
