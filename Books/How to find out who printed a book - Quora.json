            "answer_text": "You might not be able to find this information because its not readily available. Publishers may use multiple vendors to print their books. Who actually did the printing isn't important and therefore they aren't listed in the books Metadata. A book's Metadata only identifys the author, publisher, and other contributors such as illustrators, co-author, etc. Nowhere in the metadata is information requested about service providers like who the cover designer was, or who the printer (s) are. These are work for hire service vendors. You might be able to figure out who the printer is in some cases but not always. If you are buying a book from Amazon,and there is no quantity in stock number listed, its a good bet the book will be pod printed by Amazon. POD printing (print on demand) has changed the world of book printing since large quantities are no longer required for book printing. Anyone with the print on demand equipment can print the book anywhere in the world. This further delutes your ability to know who the printer is. Even an offset printer has the ability to offset print or print you small copies through print on demand. Print on demand has forever changed the book printing world. Espresso Book Machine (On Demand Books) created the print on demand technology that the entire world uses. Once a book is loaded into the machine, it can be printed by anyone with a machine unless the book was loaded through Amazon who doesn't play nice in the sandbox by running a closed system. If an author submits their book to Amazon, only Amazon can print it. In order to be available throughout the pod network, the author has to either pay for expanded distribution through Amazon or upload their book to another vendor like Ingram, On Demand Books, or a local printer with pod rights. With pod printing, a book is printed on site by the book store, printer, or online retailer. Therefore the actual printer doesn't matter since it could be anyone depending on where the book is purchased. One other clue who printed the book is to check who the actual publisher is. Most self published books aren't truley self published. When authors don't purchase their own ISBN numbers and opt for a free ISBN from a self publisher, then that company becomes the publisher and owns the distribution rights for who can print and sell the book. This means authors who use Amazon to publish their books and don't use an Amazon ISBN, Amazon becomes the publisher. If in doubt who the true publisher of a book is, go to Bookwire.com and search the title in question. If the publisher is Amazon, then they will most likely be the printer. There is no way to know if the author opted for expanded distribution allowing others to printer the book. ",

            "answer_text": "The publisher is not the same as the printer. The publishing company\u2019s name is always given on the copyright page or some other page at the front of the book; the printing company\u2019s name isn\u2019t always given. The printer is a subcontractor of the publisher. The publisher hires the printer to physically produce the pages of the book. Then the publisher may have the pages sent to yet another subcontractor to bind the pages between covers. ",
