            "answer_text": "Yes, it is written in grammatical English. However, you may find some of the sentence structures strange because it was written in 1719. That's nearly 300 years ago, and English usage has changed somewhat during the last 300 years. Certain expressions and sentence structures that were common in the 18th century are no longer in use. English is a living language, and it is changing all the time.  So, what may sound correct at one time may not sound correct at another time. However, this does not mean that what does not \"sound\" correct is not grammatical. It is just that modern readers are not used to the kind of English that was spoken (and written) in earlier centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, he followed the rules, but the rules in the late 1600s were different than they are today. He is known to have used the flamboyant, upper-crust vernacular that was popular for authors in his day, while still pursuing a very straightforward narrative style. So while Defoe followed correct usage, it isn't the usage that we generally see today, and that makes it sound strange to modern ears. Thanks for asking. ",
