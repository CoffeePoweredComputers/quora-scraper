            "answer_text": "I write every day on Quora. I\u2019ll say that on average I write about 3 pages a day (sometimes more, sometimes less.) That doesn\u2019t seem too daunting, right? I find 3 pages a day completely manageable. Then, with the help of Melissa, my editor, I collect my answers, curate the ones I like the best and separate them out into cohesive categories. After that I publish them as books. In 2016 I published two books, \u201cHow to be Ferociously Happy\u201d and \u201cAmateur\u201d.  My next book will come out in May of 2017, and then the next one after that in November 2017. I already have wrapped bundles with the contents of each one, and a file of possible titles. In other words, I am committing to this because they already exist. I intend to put out two books a year for as long as it feels right, after which I might try to do something different with my writing. I\u2019m not sure what that will be yet, but I didn\u2019t know about Quora two years ago and that seems to have worked out, even though I didn\u2019t either foresee it or plan for it. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the author and genre. Many genres, like SF/F or mainstream, are not very friendly to more than two books being released per year by the same author (in traditional publishing). They feel\u2014perhaps rightly, perhaps not!\u2014that you may saturate your market too fast, who then move on to other authors. In romance, you can safely publish six to twelve books a year without penalty. Personally, my best speed that lets me balance work and life is four books a year. But I don\u2019t write them all in the same genre or category. Usually it\u2019s a mix of something in YA, something in thriller, and and something in SF/F. Or maybe just two of those, depending on how contracts fall. I can generally do two books a year in YA without a problem, but the two adult genres have a slower pace for publication. Everybody\u2019s speed is different, and you\u2019re not competing against other authors, so don\u2019t peg your self-worth to how much or how fast you\u2019re writing. Just do you. ",
