            "answer_text": "Well to get it out of the way first, the book \u201cLord of the Flies\u201dalways struck me as a somewhat unbalanced portrayal of mankind. It is a powerful allegory for society, yes, but it is leaving all the elements out that don\u2019t fit the author\u2019s theory. In this book everyone who is good is completely useless in some way and the capable ones were completely evil and only wanted to paint their faces and kill. So, it should be no surprise that I disagree with the premise that corruption is inherent in human nature and when there are no rules to follow, we will either be evil or useless, beause of our sense of morality (or lack thereof). We are always both, good and bad, and thus have the ability to swing either way. Civilisation, rules, morality is not something external forced on us, we, the humans build it for us. (Even animals who live in packs have rules) Rules and morals have always been present, in all cultures at all times, they just changed as times changed. I am not saying, that some humans (or even most) will not behave completely out of control once you remove the veneer of civility. They will. But history has proven time and time again that we will inevitably swing back to the state of setting up rules and enforcing them again, and re-establish whatever morality we follow, based on the current cultural values and obligations. Thanks for the request. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a simple answer: If humans had the exact same moral values they wouldn\u2019t need rules because clarity or not, empathy would probably render a balanced equality. We wouldn\u2019t have to question civilization in this instance. On the other hand, it\u2019s extremely broad. Without civilization moral values would differ, without rules there would be repeated misfortune due to inexperience youth and no concept of abstinence. Rules can go as far as to say - don\u2019t pick that fruit yet as it hasn\u2019t ripened. If it were rules that gave us moral values, else not; we\u2019d all be sociopaths or we\u2019d freeze frame unable to decide what to do because no morals would have value precedence over others. If I carried on I\u2019d have to eventually say moral values are integral to human functionality in socialist survival, tribal or societal as we know it, and without them we\u2019d have to consider the conclusion of not-human. Who\u2019s to know what would succeed as necessaries to these psychological and psychiatric fixed, flux, and absent attributes between FFF and physical and environmental adaptations either? Endlessness intertwining presumptuousness. ",
