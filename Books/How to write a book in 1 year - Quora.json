            "answer_text": "Lets put this into perspective. 365 days in year (and you can have the leap year day off if it occurs that year). Book length = 90,000 words (just to be a nice round Space Opera type length.) 90,000 divide by 365 = 246 words per day, and 247 on a single random day. 246 words. per day. As a comparison, Brad Chisholm\u2019s answer is 229 words. So to determine how much time that is, try writing an answer about that length plus a bit, and that will give you the time you spend writing each day. So the above is 95 words, which took me about 5 minutes to write, including doing the math on a calculator 2 times, because I forgot the answer the first time, and had to do it again. So if it takes about 5 minutes to write 100 words, then it will likely take no more than 15 minutes to write 250. And as anyone who answers questions a lot here knows, that\u2019s slow typing. 15 minutes spent writing, per day, is not gluing your arse to a chair, or neglecting your family and friends. In fact, its less time than the average person spends reading their emails and Facebook each morning. In theory, that 15 minutes every day gets you a book written in a year. The problem is, there is no habit forming in 15 minutes a day, and most likely, weeks will go by without a word being written. And what\u2019s this \u20181 year\u2019 nonsense? Why should a book take a year to write? Are you a writer, or someone just dabbling with words? Writers write. It\u2019s what we do. And 15 minutes a day isn\u2019t a proper length of time. It can be, but seriously, allocate 2 hours and get 2000 words down each day instead, and have your 90k book out there in less than 2 months. And there we go - 315 words above in less than 15 minutes, including the time taken to do the math. ",

            "answer_text": "Discipline. Now I don\u2019t know your definition of \u201cwrite a book\u201d. A first draft? A completed, edited ms. ready to shop? We just finished our 3rd draft of our 3rd novel (Sugar High) in about 4 months, BUT half of it was cannibalized from a film script, including the A story and characters. We wrapped this inside the B story like a burrito and added more characters. It\u2019s not as convoluted as it sounds. My 4th novel, nearly done, has taken 5 years. But I was interrupted by our second novel (Kat & Maus) and a screenplay and other things I won\u2019t mention. It depends. I just spend 4 days (12 hours per) copy editing it (it\u2019s only 40k) and there are still mistakes. I think a year is reasonable for a novel. You need to be organized (make a pot of chili and eat it for 3 days) and you need to say \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cwanna hang out?\u201d. The biggest thing I can tell you is that to be a writer it is a marathon, not a sprint. You have to build in gaps, so as not to fall over. Follow me on Method, I have only so far posted \u201cHow to Learn to Write Dialogue in Your Spare Time\u201d, but I will be posting more on this topic very soon. If I can ever get off Quora. ",
