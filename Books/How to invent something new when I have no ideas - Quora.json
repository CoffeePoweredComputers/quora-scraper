            "answer_text": "Well, you first need to start to stimulate your imagination. Watch a lot of movies, read books, many of them, comics maybe too. Travel. Fill your mind up with cultural knowledge. Choose what cultural items you consume according to how much they expand your mind, how much they give you new perspectives on life. Follow you natural interests. Tickle your curiosity. Then move on to deeper materials. Start to read more about history, geography, sciences, politics, business, mathematics. Keep expanding your mind in more subtle ways. Try new experiences, like living abroad, talking to people who are very different from you, maybe try some drugs (don't get addicted to them, just try them for the experience).Acquire a broad and deep understanding of the world, its current issues, and potential for progress. Next, focus on things that you have a profound interest in. With a deep motivation to learn, get to the bottom of things. Often, acquiring a deep understanding of a specific knowledge branch requires following the branch back to the trunk. And that's where the previous step of getting a broad understanding of the world becomes useful. You will notice similarities between apparently unrelated subjects. You will develop a unique understanding of a combination of topics that maybe no other human beings have. With that particular perspective will come many ideas. Unique ideas. And that's how you invent things. You may also want to read famous inventors biographies to see how that worked for them. I find Elon Musk's story very inspiring for instance. Even if I don't plan to Colonize Mars myself, or Invent the car of the future, it stimulates me to pursue my own dreams, and turn bold ideas into something real. ",

            "answer_text": "I never set-out to be inventor, it either came to me out of frustration or because my job required me to find a solution. Some folks cannot think out-of-the-box. My wife is a numbers person and cannot draw a line and she would never attempt to build a product and take it to market. I cannot add 2 double-digit numbers in my head and yet I have more than a few inventions, none of which has made me rich but they have either made some money or been put into production. I invented the Weedzinger out of frustration. I was in the yard pounding on the handle of an upright weeding tool to free the dirt clod caught in the tines. I smashed it as hard as my brittle hands could endure and propelled it several feet into the woods. Ideas are born out of necessity and the willingness to take a chance. Taking a chance loosely translates to the amount of money you are willing to spend and if your wife will let you spend it. I have failed more times than I have succeeded but at least I tried. Look for a problem, I am certain that you can find a flaw in the way something is being done. The question is will you be willing to solve it? ",

            "answer_text": "Look at other inventions, and maybe deduce what needs to be made for society depending on what's already been made.  FOR EXAMPLE! Sometimes, there are inventions that already exist that need improvements, thus making something completely new. An easy example? The electric car.  That's something that is an improvement over something very basic, which is a completely new invention in and of itself. The Tesla is it's own thing, distinctly (and rightly) separated from the basic car line.  So, take something that exists, that people use every day, and try and figure out how to make it better. Take the vacuum cleaner for instance. I'd really like for there to be a full-size battery powered vacuum cleaner. That's something new that's an invention.  So look for imperfections in already existing inventions, and make it into something new. That's your idea. The implementation process is another long, long road ahead of the idea formulation, but if you believe in it, you can do it.  ",

I wasn\u2019t too productive and have realized this approach doesn\u2019t work for me. What works is the opposite - when you are really troubled by something that you would like solved, immediately. It can be an experience that needs improvement or a product flaw you\u2019ve identified. The most important aspect is being troubled to the level that it\u2019s a \u201cpain\u201d for you. Once you\u2019re emotionally unhappy with how things are, proceed towards identifying the root cause. If the problem is well-defined, the solution is the \u201ceasier\u201d part. That's where you can hope to invent something which is new. To be inventive rather than looking for ideas look for problems. ",

However you can hire an inventor, a designer, an engineer, or even a handyman to solve your problem for you. In most cases, there will already be a solution, you\u2019re just not aware of it, thus no invention is necessary. You might for instance have a lot of water in a hole in the ground and complain that you can\u2019t easily shovel it out. So your inclination might be to have a shovel that water doesn\u2019t spill off of. Now while you can hire an inventor/designer/engineer to design such a shovel for you, on the other hand you can hire the handyman to solve the problem and he tells you that what you need is what\u2019s called a \u201cpump\u201d that will pump the water out of the hole.
