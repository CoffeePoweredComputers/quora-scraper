Does Rob look SEVENTEEN in the movie? The way he says \u201cI\u2019m very protective of you\u201d is CRINGE-FILLED for anyone who\u2019s read the book. Their characters are so much stronger than they are portrayed in the movie. Just read the book. It\u2019s a LOT more fun than the movies. I PROMISE you that. ",
