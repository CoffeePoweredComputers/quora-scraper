            "answer_text": "Yes I have. After my father left our family he bought a small house In East London and took in lodgers One of his lodgers was a very pleasant musician called Bruce. He took in music students. One was a very nice young man who later became famous as Billy Ocean (can\u2019t remember his given name). He really studied hard and was a pleasure to be around. one Friday, Bruce said that (I\u2019ll call him) Billy was giving a concert in an East End pub. This was the late 70\u2019s and such pubs were often then openly racist -it was the time of the National Front, remember. And Billy was of course black. So I was a bit worried - rightly or wrongly - about whether he\u2019d be safe. The pub customers paid no attention when Billy took to the stand. Then he started to sing and it went silent. You could have heard a pin drop. He was simply awesome. It was clear that he was massively talented. People put down their glasses, stopped their conversations, just to listen. I do not remember ever seeing Billy again. I did not then live with my Dad, if I remember correctly. But I never forgot him and have followed his stellar career with great pleasure. My main memory is of how very pleasant he was and of how seriously he studied with Bruce (a classically trained musician). \u2018When the going gets tough, the tough get going!\u2019 You probably don\u2019t remember me, Billy, but I truly hope that life goes well for you.

            "answer_text": "I met Wolfmother at their US premiere and they were NOT famous then. My nephew wanted to meet them because he was a senior in high school and they were a new alternative bane he was into. I worked band gigs backstage and was venue requested to work that event which was cool because I got a promotional guest package. AND\u2026. I have a story. I had arranged for my nephew and his girlfriend to be backstage guests HOWEVER that same day of the concert she dumped him and he was so devastated he locked himself in his room and ignored the concert. My sister texted me the info and I told the band. WHAT THEY DID WAS, sent a runner upstairs for a posted band poster and they ALL SIGNED IT. 2 of the guys got out of the shower to sign it and that left water drop spots. They were really cool. Also later after the show they brought me into the dressing room (post autograph thing) to make me a job offer to travel with them because I was really a cool guy they could hang with and look out for them. The bad news is = I was in a situation where I had commitments and there was no way I could go. I relish that night & that offer. VERY LATE around 1 am I drove 40 miles to my sisters house and slipped the poster under my nephews door which was such an emotional moment he began crying over that. OMG I am a cool uncle. Wolfmother was a cool band, even before they were nationally known. ",
