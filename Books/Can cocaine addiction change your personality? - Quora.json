            "answer_text": "Hell yes it can. Addiction of any kind can. But cocaine is bad because you can't stop once you start. I used to love it at first. I would do a line and go dancing or to parties and feel like I was having the best time. But after awhile you stay in rhe bathroom longer and longer because you need more lines.You start forgetting about going out. You get selfish. You think people are screwing you over. You stop going to work o, Monday because you now do it all weekend and can't get up. The people you hang out with all do it too. No more party.Its all about getting that high you used to get. Which will never happen. You get mean. You get lazy except for when you need to find dope. You get fired. You have to drink or take something to come down. That great sex? Your to busy cleaning out the straws and doing it all because you Jones. To even remember to go to the bedroom. Your empty all you have inside you is NEED. So yea knock yourself out. I hope you don't actually. Its a horrible drug. I had to have my sinuses rebuilt. And after 14 years. I still constantly blow my nose. Please. You do not want this world. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, much like other drugs and alcohol, cocaine can significantly change an individual\u2019s personality. The reason is simple: drugs alter the brain. They flood the brain with dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is present in regions of the brain that regulate movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. Overtime, cocaine alters critical brain activity and tricks the brain into prioritizing the substance over everything else. Because the brain is consumed by the drug, an individual\u2019s personality drastically changes. Some ways that cocaine alters an individual\u2019s personality and behavior include: - Secrecy - Paranoia - Selfishness - Restlessness - Forgetfulness - Impulsiveness - Becoming abusive - High risk behavior - Low stress tolerance - Frequent mood swings Erratic behavior and negative changes in personality can have devastating effects on an individual\u2019s overall well-being and those who love them. For an individual to reclaim their former self after being affected by substance abuse, they need to be ready to commit to serious lifestyle changes, starting with quitting. Because drugs and alcohol alter the brain, it is impossible for the brain to heal without the individual abstaining from drugs and alcohol. ",
