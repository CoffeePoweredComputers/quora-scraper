            "answer_text": "The first part of the question never resolves, so I'll go straight to the second part. Who or what determines the interpretation of the Bible? At the root level, linguistics impacts every aspect of the text. How Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic words are used in placement, context and proliferation. This comes through analysis of extant contemporary samples, preserved samples in recounts found in later works, lexicons, etc. Scholarly editions of the Bible include a critical apparatus to assist the reader in determining deviations and outlying uses of words - irregular meanings, uncommon usage, etc. Once a person works from a translation, it is the translator that controls the interpretation of the text. The Septuagint, for example, replaces Edom and Edomites in certain contexts in the Masoretic text with Canaan and Canaanites. One could surmise that the translators determined that historical knowledge of the cultural lines of various groups had declined among the Jews and it was simpler to make an appropriate substitution rather than rely on the reader's knowledge to bridge the connection between the consequences of one cultural system that impact the future of another. The translator often must make choices when translating terms with multiple meanings or compound meanings (where multiple meaning apply and are all intended) into a language that has no equivalent term or concept. The impact of this is greater when going from a low vocabulary, low precision, high nuance languages to a high vocabulary, high precision, overly articulate language. Nuances get sacrificed for the sake of clarity. The translator controls this interpretation. Once a person dedicates themselves to a translation or a primary text, the context and tradition they engage the text in determines their interpretation. Texts are never read in a vacuum. They find themselves in liturgical environments where they are tied to a person's own labor and the expectations of their society. This could be a church, or a college library, or quora or reddit - or multiple layers, such as an English speaking luddite religious household in the American bible belt. Some folks suggest using the writings of early church fathers as a means of attaining a purer or clearer understanding of the bible. This adds an additional layer of interpretation between the reader and the bible, as well as the need to evaluate how one reads the fathers - making the effort to get to the meaning of the bible even more complicated. Early Christian authors come with their own unique critical challenges to overcome. The point of all this is to say that believers and atheists who insist on taking the text at face value often have not been critical or humble with regard to how their personal interpretations have been colored by the intermediary layers of interpretation that are unknowingly or unconsciously applied to the text before it reaches their thought process. Most individuals are guided in the interpretation of the biblical texts by resonance or dissonance with their familiar expectations of the text or their opposites. It depends on whether the are looking for what \"feels right\" to them, or what \"challenges their perceptions\" of what they know. Many people try to uphold the ideal hermeneutic of approaching the text each time as if it was the first time they ever read or heard it. The challenges are no different from the above - they are just explicitly acknowledged as obstacles to objective interpretation. ",

            "answer_text": "If the Bible is not meant to be taken literally, who determines the interpretation of it? When you read in an article something like \"The whole town came out to welcome their championship team,\" how do you decide that the meaning is not \"every single human in the town?\" If you're like most people, you don't \"decide\" anything, you take it for granted that the phrase is hyperbole, and doesn't mean every single human, but \"a large crowd.\" The Bible is literature. As such, it uses literary devices like hyperbole, metaphor, parables, just as other literature does. It is not true that \u201cthe Bible is not meant to be taken literally.\u201d What IS true is that we are to take literally what is meant literally, metaphorically what is meant as metaphor, hyperbole as hyperbole, and so on. Sure, there are passages that require more interpretation than others, but for the most part, we just take for granted that a parable is a story meant to illustrate a point. So, for example, there was no prodigal son. This was a story, a parable. Not to be taken \"literally.\" If there is disagreement over any particular passage, someone actually interested in what the intended meaning is will find that information is available to anyone who seeks it. But if this is just meant as a rhetorical question to try to shed a negative light on Scripture or Christians, you probably won\u2019t come to any logical conclusion. ",
