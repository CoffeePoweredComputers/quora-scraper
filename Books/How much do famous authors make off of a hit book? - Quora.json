            "answer_text": "How famous, and how big a hit? Are you including subsidiary rights, or just book sales? The usual royalties on hardcover books are 10% of cover price. If a hardcover book lists for $24.95 and sells a million copies, the author gets $2.50 cents for each copy, for a total of $2,495,00.00. (A million copies in hardcover is a huge success, though. Very few books do that well \u2014 but a handful do.) Mass-market paperbacks pay from 6% to 10% of cover price, depending on the contract terms, so a $6.99 paperback might pay the author anywhere from 42 cents to 70 cents per copy. Trade paperbacks generally pay 7.5% to 12.5%. Ebooks are less standardized, but 25% of the price is common. Foreign rights may also bring in money. Often these are supposed to pay royalties once they\u2019ve earned out the advance money, but in my experience many foreign publishers are pretty lax about actually paying those. Except the French \u2014 for some reason French publishers are surprisingly scrupulous about actually paying royalties. The amount paid for foreign rights can be almost anything; I\u2019ve been paid as little as $50 by a publisher in a small country with a weak economy (e.g., Slovenia in the 1990s), but a hit novel by a major author could easily bring a five-figure advance for each language it\u2019s translated into \u2014 maybe more, since I\u2019ve never been a major author and therefore don\u2019t have first-hand knowledge. So that\u2019s the actual book sales, but authors also make money from speaking engagements (including TV interviews, but radio and bookstore signings generally don\u2019t pay, you just do those for the publicity), the sale of movie and TV rights, and so on. Movie rights for a major hit novel can easily pay a couple of million dollars. So J.K. Rowling has made billions (literally) from the Harry Potter series, but some bestselling authors are still barely paying the mortgage. ",
