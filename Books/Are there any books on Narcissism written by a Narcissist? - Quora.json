            "answer_text": "I wouldn't listen to any other narcissist on the topic of narcissism besides Sam Vaknin. He has had enough narcissistic meltdowns etc which made him to question his own narcissism and finally open about it and talk honestly on the topic. I am pretty sure that his narcissistic needs are meant by being so honest on the topic as that gave him new recognition through out the world so he has good enough reasons to be honest about it. You can see his narcissistic personality through his videos but he definitely knows what he is talking about. A lot of people claim to be a narcissist and talk about narcissism, to be honest I find them faking it as it is kind of their new business project. ",
