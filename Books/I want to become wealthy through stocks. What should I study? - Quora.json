            "answer_text": "No one becomes wealthy through stocks. Wealthy people buy and sell stocks. So do average middle class people. They all mostly stay right where they are. More of them lose their shirt than beat the market by any significant factor.  Beyond that it doesn't much matter what you study. Assuming felony larceny is not offered as a major at your local business school it's more about who you know.  Here's another approach. Pick a much, much smaller goal, something you can achieve in less than five years. Get that done. Rinse, repeat. ",
