            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been there, and I decided to take it. Why? I enjoyed the time I was in front of any technological device. The first year was \u201cshocking\u201d for me. I didn\u2019t think that it would be that way, I had no idea how to program, and I had a lot of Math that was actually hard. At some point, I asked my parents to drop out so I could apply to another degree in the the next year. My parents didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t, but asked me to say until the end of the year, they would pay for it, and after that I could do what I wanted. To sum up, I kind of started liking it, and didn\u2019t quit. It took me a lot of effort to complete it. Would I do it again? Yes and No. It offers good market opportunities worldwide, but I\u2019m feeling bad for not enjoying my life as I should be doing. I\u2019m 22 and I feel like I\u2019ve done nothing. In my country (Portugal) the pay isn\u2019t that high, and it\u2019s important to mention that is an office job and you will be closed most of your time (so make sure you are ready for it). Here we can\u2019t travel that much, because the income is most of the times not high enough. Probably I want to start to look for opportunities outside, where my lifestyle can improve, and I can travel a lot more, because for me, it\u2019s one of the best things we can do in life. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way to really know is by trying it. I can\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019ll be worth it for you. What I can tell you is that it is not like doing IT (which I assume is doing IT administration tasks), or using Adobe products. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been involved with a CS curriculum, but what I\u2019ve heard about it indicates that in some universities it has some things in common with my experience. At other universities, they take CS in a purely theoretical direction. In the former case, there is quite a bit of programming, and some math. In the latter case, there is no programming, or very little, and a lot of math. If you\u2019re more interested in IT work, there might be a CS major (there are universities that have more than one now) that goes light on CS, and has you doing more IT work. You might also take a look at a CIS (Computer Information Systems) major, since from what I\u2019ve heard, business colleges retooled a long time ago, and went whole hog into creating a modern IT curriculum.
