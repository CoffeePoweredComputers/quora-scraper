            "answer_text": "It's not too difficult but I do recommend that you practice \u2026 practice \u2026 practice \u2026. to start with the very basics get yourself a book from the library and read it over and over again then simply get a hook and some yarn \u2026. you can usually get these cheaply at your local charity shop \u2026. as I wouldn't spend too much money on equipment and yarn to start with as you will almost certainly end up pulling your crochet out lots of times until you master the basic stitches, so just use a cheap or donated ball of wool until your feel confident with the stitches. I was self taught and I really did spend hours and hours practicing and pulling out. There are different ways of holding the hook too \u2026. so you just crochet with how comfortable you feel \u2026. some hold the hook like a knife and others hold it like a pencil \u2026. there is no right or wrong way. I would also use the vast array of tutorials that you can find on YouTube as it is good to follow visually and you can pause the video as many times as you like too. Please feel free to check out my channel where I have lots of crochet for beginners tutorials and hints and tips. Loopy Mabel Vintage Style What I would say though is don\u2019t give up as to start with you may feel that you\u2019re just a tangle of wooly knots and end up throwing it in the bin \u2026. but please don\u2019t as when you do finally master this amazing craft you will be so pleased with yourself. I love to crochet and share my knowledge with beginners and my tutorials also have free patterns that you can follow along with me too.  \u00a00:00-0:30 ",

            "answer_text": "I have taught myself to crochet and knit. I got books teaching different stitches, especially basic and common stitches. Those are an excellent resource. I find patterns of projects I want to try on Pinterest, because they are free on there, or Red Heart, Patons, or another yarn company web site. They tell you exactly what you need, which yarn , needle, extra tools, everything. Sometimes there are guided project on You Tube, or some of the yarn craft forums. They are called \u201ccrochet alongs\u201d. And little bits at a time are released and you can follow along over month or two period, with detailed video or written instructions. I watch You Tube tutorials often for help. I watch the same thing again and again until I understand and can do it. A simple first project, like a single crochet wash cloth, could be learned and completed with less than 24 hrs of learning time. Try for 2 hrs , everyday. I often had to take whole rows of stitches out and start over. But practice patience and put the practice time in. The first wash cloth will probably not be awesome. But it gets better quickly as you perfect each stitch and your tension and technique. It\u2019s worth the time learning. ",
