            "answer_text": "So you wanna get out of anxiety ? Yea it's just obvious. Try doing what you like whenever you feel down, and when you start feeling better you can get into studies as you must have some targets in your life. And you can also give it a shot on what you want in your life? Figure it out!!! think what you like.. ??What appeals you most.?? What you wanna become? Figure it out !!!! and stop thinking about your result, as you know that it's not gonna change. Know that result is just unimportant, I want to tell you as a guardian that these marks are not that important in life most important is your work. If you can work hard with great goals you can become great without these degrees and marks. So for god sake get rid of this hunger for marks. I can say by my experiences ,It is just of no use If you wanna achieve great heights \u2026if.. you wanna be really very rich in your life. But if you wanna live a mediocre life wanting to get a job then it's good to long for marks as they require such meaningless criteria. If you understand my words in their true sense then you will never feel anxious again. So if you got what I said Do Up vote \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Stay blessed \ud83d\ude0a Have faith Everything will go great No matter what the results are you much know you are always a great person. Know your greatness respect your talent. Love your self. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 Never judge it upon some other person's thinking. Don't be a puppet in the hands of worldly people. ",

            "answer_text": "You can do this whenever you are anxious-sit erect keeping eyes closed. Breathe in and out slowly, with attention on the breaths. Do it for a few minutes. If thoughts come during breathing,focus on your breaths and keep breathing. The guided meditations by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar can help. If you have given your best, that's all you could have done. If you have not given your best, then also thinking about the result is of no use. Thinking about the result will not change the result,dear. Think about what you should do now and do that. That can keep away anxiety. ",
