            "answer_text": "No, they can not without either your consent and signature OR litigation. Fraud of course is always a possibility. If you were not sued and did not sign, you need to check the paperwork, follow the money and get the police involved. If they tell you it is civil, remind them that it is theft and that is a crime. A good attorney will be important. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on how your name is on the deed. Taking you off completely would be more difficult but if you are listed on the deed as an \u201cor\u201d it would be possible for them to sell the property without your permission, where as an \u201cand\u201d deed would require both parties to sign off on the sale. It would be hard to have deed modified without proper permissions, those involved in these types of things do pay a good deal of attention to the fine details and will put the breaks on things where everything is not in order.

If that sort of thing is done thru a court system it could be done. For instance after you die that can happen in probate. As part of a divorce or a foreclosure. I am sure there are other exapmles also. ",
