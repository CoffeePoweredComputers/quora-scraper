Then coming to the point :- Physics - DC PANDEY and NCERT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. These two books are jUST enough. Chemistry - NCERT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS .If you want to excell in organic chemistry then ORGANIC CHEMISTRY BY DK SINGH. Biology- NCERT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. Study your ncert books thoroughly. ",
