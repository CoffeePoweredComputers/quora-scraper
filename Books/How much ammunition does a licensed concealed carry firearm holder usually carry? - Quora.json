            "answer_text": "It depends on the gun being carried, and the paranoia level of the carrier. Some guys arm up like they expect to be in an extended running gun battle with 6\u20138 gang bangers. In reality, most times when there is a CHL shooting, they happen at less than 15 feet, more than 3 shots are very rarely fired, and most CHL holders know that, choosing just to carry whatever is in the gun. If he\u2019s carrying a .22 Long Rifle, he may want all the ammo he can get, because that little jewel is VERY lethal, but isn\u2019t a \u201cMan Stopper\u201d. THAT is an example where you might have to shoot someone 4\u20135 times, even more, to get them on the ground, unless you put one into their forehead. The bullet\u2019s light weight and relatively low speed means it doesn\u2019t just drill a straight hole until it stops. When I worked at The County Hospital, where all the gunshot victims get taken, I talked to some Emergency Room surgeons who said they hate having to repair a wound from a .22LR worse than any other gun, because it tends to ricochet everywhere and tumble after it hits, leaving a ragged wound channel that might go anywhere. Saving someone\u2019s life after that was a much bigger trick than with a 9mm or .45ACP. The .22LR is lethal in the long term, but it won\u2019t make someone stop what they\u2019re doing RIGHT NOW, unless you get a head shot, and being able to do that is the main aim of carrying a gun. You don\u2019t have to kill them, you just have to make them stop what they are doing, or intending to do. If you\u2019re a good enough shot to kneecap someone while under stress, that\u2019s plenty. They\u2019re not only on the ground, but in too much pain to do much except suffer. This may surprise you, but gunshot wounds don\u2019t generally hurt much, if at all. Kneecaps and most stomach wounds produce crippling pain, but for the most part, gunshots don\u2019t hurt much at the time they\u2019re received. You can see a stomach wound from a .38 spcl happening if you watch Lee Harvey Oswald getting it from Jack Ruby inside the Dallas Police Headquarters, on live television. Oswald\u2019s last step in this world was taken just before this gunshot to his stomach.  Two guys I know that were shot in the thigh with .22LR cartidges (one shot by himself while practicing \u201cfast draw\u201d) said it only produced a mild burning sensation, and almost no impact. The guy who shot himself actually drove himself to the hospital after that. There was only the mild burning sensation until they got to the hospital and someone ran a giant Q-Tip into the wound. THAT woke up the numbed nerves, and it was a different story. When a bullet strikes, it numbs all the nerves where it hit. I have known five people who were shot and they all reported the same. It felt like they had been hit with a hammer, (except for two .22LR thighs) but it didn\u2019t actually hurt. OTOH, if the gun carried is a .45ACP or .40 S&W, two shots into someone\u2019s chest (Usually One) is going to leave him on the ground, right away. No reason to even carry a completely full magazine, much less spares. Or a .380ACP typically has a 6\u20137 round magazine, and that\u2019s typically enough, but the ammo is light, and people often carry a spare mag, just to give themselves a sense of security they don\u2019t need, unless they barely squeaked by the range qualification for their license. No amount of firepower can make up for bad shot placement. ",

            "answer_text": "I typically carry two spare magazines an 8 round and a ten round. My EDC has 7+1. Do I expect to fire 26 rounds in a confrontation with a criminal? No, although it is theoretically possible to be attacked by multiple assailants. MS-13 and other gangs commonly work in pairs and trios. Self directed Jihadis such as the Garland , Texas attackers and the Boston bomber brothers and the California Christmas party shooters may also present multiple threats. I still probably am not going to need 26 rounds. In an armed encounter with a run of the mill robber or carjacker, even if really determined or drugged 5\u20137 rounds is probably adequate. Why carry the spare mags? Because the most rapid, foolproof immediate action drill for an automatic pistol malfunction, after \u201cTap, Rack\u201d and no fix, such as a double feed, is \u201cReload Completely\u201d. As the magazine is dropped the crap clogging the breech area will fall out. Firmly inserting a new magazine and racking the slide should put you back in business, and you still have a spare magazine ready to go. Recover your dropped mag later if you need more ammunition. Oh and for the fans of Gaston\u2019s Fabulous Tactical Tupperware? I can hear them snickering as I describe an immediate action drill on a 1911. Glocks double feed too. You might want a spare mag as well. Spare magazines help get the gun going again after a malfunction. On the other hand, world famous firearms trainer and author , Massad Ayoob has noted that in the course of his career he has interviewed hundreds of gunfight survivors. Not a single one has ever told him they wished for a smaller gun or less ammo. I carry two spare magazines . It\u2019s sort of a pain in the ass, but on the other hand, they might come in handy. ",
