            "answer_text": "This is a genuinely tricky problem, one that has caused issues for countless authors over the course of centuries. Poe\u2019s Law is a nasty fact of life when writing baddies, and there are going to be people who sympathize with your villain the moment you give them even a smidge of humanity. Of course, humanizing villains is a vital element to making them compelling, so you have to take certain steps to clarify to the audience that while the character might have reasons for acting the way they do, these reasons do not justify the consequences of their actions. The number one way you can do this is to show the damage done by the villain\u2019s actions. If they carve a warpath across the country on some grand crusade, show the villages razed in their wake, the families separated by the fighting, and the scared citizens who have to go hungry because their fields were sacked by the baddie\u2019s legions. If the villain is more grounded and asserts petty power over those in their vicinity, show the emotional damage that their victims endure in the wake of such cruelty. In summary, make it clear that people are being harmed by the villain. Humanize their victims and no amount of sympathetic background will be able to cast the baddie as anything but a villain. ",

            "answer_text": "By making them interesting or fun to be around - actions, language, humor, viewpoint. By explaining their motives just enough to make them appear credible and that they might have a point. Perhaps they can not help their own path? Maybe they deserve some kind of justice or revenge? Or are they themselves under threat from others? Sympathy comes from relating to their situation, not necessarily agreeing with their choices. For example, could a tyrant survive their own henchmen unless they were ruthless? Paranoia can be close to reality when a perceived weakness can lead to a leader being overthrown by their friends / rivals. ",
