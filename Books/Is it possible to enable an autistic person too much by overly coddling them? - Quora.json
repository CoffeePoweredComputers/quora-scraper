            "answer_text": "Overly coddling anybody, even pets leads to letting them get away with shit. No good! That leads to spoiled brat syndrome. Diagnosed as \u2018shit-head\u2019. Civilized life starts with the dog going \u2018toilet\u2019 outside and not shitting and peeing all over the house. Chucking tantrums, harming anybody around emotionally and sometimes physically is the equivalent. Dealing with such occurrences by threats and punishment will ruin the chances of a much needed home with plenty of \u2018Warmth of the nest\u2019, and turn a house into a war-zone. Praising a dog for doing it\u2019s business on grass or guiding an Autistic person towards relaxing and providing a situation to let that happen has the same underlying principle: Positive reinforcement. Learning, training by encouragement, positive motivation. Society gives plenty of bad advice in that regard, in form of kick ass management I so despise. Medicine tries to throw pills at it. Neither respect true underlying causes but try to get away with their own kind of shit. Feeling loved, lots of cuddly \u2018Warmth of the nest\u2019, being accepted and appreciated as they are is an absolute true need of any vertebrae including humans and that is just some more true for Autists. Depriving them of that is a form of brutal punishment and that will backfire with most amazing reactions and neuroses. Underlying cause: hurt, pain, perceived or real trauma resulting in \u2018I\u2019m not worth to be loved\u2019 and when that leads to anger and aggression, both being allowed, or even used and admired, that turns to \u2018I hate everybody\u2019 - Welcome to WWIII, - you\u2019ve lost before it really started. More detail here: My answer to How do I encourage my autistic 14 year old to be more independent? My daughter wants to be forever taken care of by other people. Coddling her too much will affect her development. She is diagnosed with mild autism and is capable of most things. There is a fine but highly critical line in between mollycoddling and love and understanding in the sands of lives beaches. Every wave will wash one line away just to let another one appears. You are dealing with a moving target. That\u2019s life, that\u2019s NatURe, everything moves Observe, learn and think for yourself. You\u2019ll find out with that when it\u2019s better to go with the flow or to put lots into swimming against the flow to get to the source of the unnecessary drama. W Btw. Most \u2018information\u2019 regarding Autism is cooked up drama for the purpose of business by people with anxiety disorders. Fears of having not enough power - glory - gold. Common sense is the means to look through it all and I\u2019m sure you got some of that. So, YOU CAN DO IT! And you should be respectively for the Autistic person offended by the terms high functioning/low functioning! They are biased, demeaning and judgmental! ",

            "answer_text": "Enable?! Enable them to do what? Live a full and productive life? Yes it is possible to assist a person with a disability to be a functioning member of society. It is possible to provide support, love, understanding and compassion to someone who struggles every single day with sensory overload from the simplest of things such as the lighting or noise levels in a room. Your question however is clearly ablist and you think that a person with autism is bad or doing something on purpose and they have control over their autism! If you think that helping someone who is struggling is \u2018coddling \u2018 and that autism can be made any worse by being kind and gentle with someone you really don't understand autism at all! You can't make someone more autistic!!! It is not a disease that treated incorrectly will get worse. In fact if you are patient and kind, supportive and truly understanding you can help support a person with autism to gain valuable skills to help function in society more easily. A person with autism doesn't do it on purpose, you can't beat autism out of a child. You can't discipline a person who has a disability and make them less disabled. Think about it like this\u2026 If you took a person who uses a wheel chair and took the wheelchair away because that is coddling them would they suddenly be able to walk?! No! If they received lots of therapy and support, perhaps a walking frame they might in time learn to walk with support and assistance if their disability allowed however if their disability was such that they didn't have legs they wouldn't. Some people with autism can learn some coping strategies and others can not. But if you see autism as a problem that autistic people can control and that can be made worse by making adjustments for them you are the problem. Autism is a different way of processing the world, a different way of dealing with things and different isn't necessarily bad! ",
