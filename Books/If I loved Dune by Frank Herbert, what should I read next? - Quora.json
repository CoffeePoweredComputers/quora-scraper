            "answer_text": "Dune Messiah. Now, that\u2019s obviously the next book in the series so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re considering it, but as I look at answers I don\u2019t see anyone say just \u201cDune Messiah\u201d, they\u2019re all talking about committing to at least 2 more novels in the story, so I think it\u2019s appropriate to understand why Dune Messiah is a book I consider essential and nothing after is: Dune Messiah completely the original trilogy of Paul Atreides life. What\u2019s that you say? Isn\u2019t Messiah the 2nd book in the series? Yes but: \u201cDune\u201d was not written as a novel. It\u2019s a series of stories bound together.\u201cDune\u201d can in fact be seen as a story of 2 \u201cnovels\u201d which in total encompass 400+ pages. \u201cDune Messiah\u201d is a 200+ page story that fits in as the \u201c3rd novel\u201d of the series.\u201cDune\u201d doesn\u2019t really have an ending. I mean, it\u2019s ended with a nice touch, but it\u2019s an ending that says \u201cOkay, what\u2019s Paul do next\u201d. I\u2019ll refrain from going into details here but the ending to \u201cDune Messiah\u201d is far more definite, far more dramatic, and far more cathartic.When I think of Paul\u2019s prescience, the scene that I think really demonstrates it best, and gives chills like no other, happens in \u201cDune Messiah\u201d.The upcoming adapatation by Villeneuve appears to be following what I consider this natural organizational structure covering only about half of \u201cDune\u201d. This undoubtedly seems crazy who consider \u201cDune\u201d to be THE masterpiece, but once you realize that the best way to make a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d style trilogy is to end with \u201cDune Messiah\u201d this becomes the clear way to do it. I\u2019m impressed that Villeneuve thought this way, though I was already impressed with him after \u201cThe Arrival\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner\u201d so his exquisite taste is no longer a surprise.If you\u2019re looking for another immersive book series, here\u2019s a recent one: The Broken Earth Trilogy in Order by N. K. Jemisin ",

            "answer_text": "Well there are the sequels and you could try the Dune books written by his son Brian Herbert & Kevin A Anderson but they are not anywhere as good, well there is a sizable amount of people who think they are the equivilent of digging up Frank Herbetrs corpse and riding the burning cadaver down a street. Lets just say I found them disappointing particularly the Legends of Dune stuff. For a good read I recommend the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons : curiously I found this due to a fluke mention in a Japanese Anime and it was good though it was supposed to be 2 books there was the sequels set nearly 300 years later which are not so good but still worth a read. The Shrike in the first two books is a particularly striking character. For a series of books The Culture series by Iain M Banks, I used to see a rather pretty girtl who recommended books by Iain Banks such as the Crow Road which I did read, well it is the same guy. Although it does have rather ridiculous Alien sort of names it works so much better than the rather casual sci-fi naming conventions and although I am in the middle of the 3rd book they have been great.  I enjoyed the Player of Games and the particular Scottish humour which works for me one book although not not in the culture series with a particularly vile character who is invading this planetary system attacks an gas Giant inhabited by a very ancient race only to find they can defend themselves very effectively has his second in command tell him subsinctly before he is destroyed that \u201cyou are a C**t\u201d had me laugh out loud on the bus even though I was holding on to the seat by only one buttock cheek at the time whilst going home from work.
