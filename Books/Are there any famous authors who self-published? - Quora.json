            "answer_text": " Although it seems but a pipe dream to many, over the last few decades, a variety of self-published authors have gone on to experience mainstream success. In fact, a number of self-published authors have topped national bestseller lists this summer alone. One example is Mike Omer, a relatively unknown author who, over the course of Amazon\u2019s \u201cPrime Day\u201d back in July, sold more books than current literary heavyweights like J.K. Rowling, James Patterson, and Stephen King. He did this with his most recent title, a mystery called A Killer\u2019s Mind. Omer, a 39-year-old Israeli computer engineer and self-published author, found initial success with his first eBook, Spider\u2019s Web, along with its sequels\u2013\u2013so much success that Thomas & Mercer, an Amazon imprint, signed him to a distribution deal. In fact, it was Thomas & Mercer who published A Killer\u2019s Mind. As he told The Atlantic last month, Omer now makes more money from his books than he ever did as a computer engineer. Another example is Andy Weir. Weir initially failed to sell his first book, The Martian, so he began posting free chapters of it on his personal website. Later, he put a 99-cent version on Kindle. By 2013, the book had become so popular that Weir received an offer from Crown Publishing to buy the book for $100,000. Meredith Wild, meanwhile, wrote the erotic Hacker novels, a series that follows young businesswoman Erica Hathaway and her relationship with billionaire and rumored hacker, Blake Landon. Wild self-published the series\u2019 first four books before scoring a $7 million publishing deal with Grand Central Publishing\u2019s \u201cForever\u201d imprint. The series has gone on to sell 1.2 million eBooks and approximately 200,000 print-on-demand trade paperbacks. Examples of this sort of self-publishing success are countless. But the question for those seeking the same thing now is, how did these authors do it? It\u2019s all about the three P\u2019s. There are, ultimately, three components every successful independent author possesses. At BookBaby, we call them the three P\u2019s. Professionalism. It\u2019s incumbent that self-published authors invest in the content and packaging of their books. That means using a professional editor to thoroughly vet the words. Next comes a book formatting expert to enhance the reading experience with an attractive book layout, be it a printed book or an eBook. And finally, your book deserves the services of a real book cover designed professionally. A self-published book must look and read every bit as professional as the best sellers.Platform. All authors need to have some kind of marketing platform from which to launch their online literary career. That platform should exist primarily online: almost 80 percent of all books are now purchased through online retail sites or direct-to-fan pages. From Twitter and Facebook, to blogs and sales pages, authors have to devote resources to cultivating an excellent online presence.Perspiration. Finally, good old-fashioned sweat goes a long way in successfully promoting a book. Very few books ever get picked up in a viral storm of sales. Successful self-published authors understand how much energy is needed to adequately promote their work.This might seem like a lot, but the authors who follow this formula garner more widespread success. The success of Weir, Omer, and Wild might not have been possible via traditional publishing. This is evidenced by the data. According to Author Earnings, independent publishers are gaining readers as quickly as traditional publishers are losing them. The self-published share of paid US eBook units increased from 44.7 percent to 46.4 percent between the second quarters of 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile, the traditionally published share of paid eBook units decreased from 45.5 percent to 43.2 percent. It used to be quite rare for a self-published author to experience breakout sales. Every few years, the public might hear about some unknown author zooming up the bestseller lists like the occasional comet in the sky. But it was far from common. Now, that\u2019s all changed. Last year, 284 of the top 1,000 best-selling eBooks in the US were written by independent authors. Not all are as famous now as Weir, Wild, or Omer, true\u2013\u2013but that\u2019s likely because they\u2019re busy writing and selling books. At the end of the day, not every independent author is going to hit the bestseller list. But you have a better chance of doing so if you study the hard work of those who have. The success you seek is attainable\u2013\u2013you just need to work for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow! These other answers have a very funny idea about what the word \u201cfamous\u201d means! Here is my idea of famous: Leaves of Grass was self published by Walt Whitman (1855). He designed it and set the type too. It was printed by the Rome brothers, James and Thomas. That first edition was only sold in two stores\u2014one in New York and one in Brooklyn. More editions followed, adding many more poems (that first version had only 12 poems and no author credit. None had titles in the first version. The first poem, was later titled \u201cSong of Myself\u201d.  A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was self published in 1843. His costs were high though. He sold out the first edition but only made \u00a3137.  The Joy of Cooking was self published in 1931. She spent all of the $6000 that she had to publish the book. Sales of that first edition carried her along until a substantially reworked version was issued by Bobbs-Merrill in 1936.  No one would publish Swan\u2019s Way by Proust. Proust had money so he paid publisher Editions Grasset to print the book. After the first volume was issued, Nobel Prize-winning writer and editor Andre Gide realized he was wrong and published the rest fo Remembrance of Thing Past.  Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf founded Hogarth Press and published most of her work.  e.e cummings\u2019 third book of poems, &, was self-published in 1925. Edgar Allan Poe published his first book in 1827. It was 40 pages of poetry. He was 18 years old. He also published his second book of poems in 1829, For his third book of poems he got fellow West Point cadets to subscribe to raise the money to publish it. None of his famous work was self published. Twain was already somewhat famous when he turned to self-publishing in 1884. He started Charles L. Webster & Co. The first two books were the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) and the Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (1885). The company failed in 1894. He was a terrible businessman.  In late 1961, Margaret Atwood won the E. J. Pratt Medal for her self-published book of poems, Double Persephone.  People, Places and Things was self-published in 1960 by Stephen King\u2019s own publishing company, Triad & Gaslight Books. He was 15 and it didn\u2019t really sell. Beatrix Potter self published Peter Rabbit in 1901 with 250 copies. The next year it was so successful that Frederick Warne who had rejected it picked it up and had sold 20,000 copies of the book.  L. Frank Baum published three of his first nonfiction books: Baum\u2019s Complete Stamp Dealers Directory, The Book of the Hamburgs, The Art of Decorating Dry Goods Windows and Interiors. None of his well known Oz books were self published. ",

His mystery series does very well because J.A. is also a killer self-promoter. J. A. Konrath - Wikipedia He doesn\u2019t give his books away like Doctorow as far as I know. Those are the two most famous current authors I know about and have read. Many authors in early times self-published, but mostly before the advent of Big Publishing which managed to kill the hopes of many good writers over the years. The ability of anybody to self-publish, while diluting the supply of books with a certain amount of crap, is becoming more respectable as self-pubbers improve their work. ",
