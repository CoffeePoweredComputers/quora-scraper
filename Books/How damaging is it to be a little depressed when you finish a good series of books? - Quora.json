            "answer_text": "There is no damage involved. There is absolutely no correlation of finishing a book and feeling depressed. The feeling that we get when we finish a good series is a small existential crisis. The feeling of \u201cwhat now?\u201d The way to deal with that is to accept two universal truths : Nothing stays forever. Everything comes to an end.Thoughts and feeling have a fleeting nature.The feeling that you feel is like passing clouds under a blue sky. The blue sky will always exist, its just that sometimes it gets covered by clouds and it might feel that these clouds will never clear. But remember the second point - everything is fleeting. Stay with the book for as long as you want and then go get another one! Sometimes things are super simple :)  ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, well this is my first time answering a question so, here goes. I am a huge Enid Blyton fan and simply love her books. I feel exactly the same way you are feeling right now, but when I finish reading any book of hers I buy, I usually go online and download books. The first time I did this, it felt super weird for me because reading books has a different feeling altogether. Anyway, I think this might help you. And it is not at all damaging to be depressed (however, it depends on how much you love books). Here\u2019s a website to help: Z-Library. The world's largest ebook library. ",

If you can\u2019t handle mild disapointments and let downs without being \u2018damaged\u2019 you have some serious issues you need to probably see a doctor about. The average person doesn\u2019t get \u2018damaged\u2019 from mild letdowns. One deals with them and moves on. \u2018Damage\u2019 occurres with serious mental trauma. Not the end of a book or TV series. Do you get seriously traumatized if you stub your toe or get a hangnail? Because it\u2019s about the same thing. A mild moment of irritation or pain and then you move on. You don\u2019t get traumatized or damaged. ",
