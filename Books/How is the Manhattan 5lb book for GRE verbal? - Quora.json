            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Actually I myself never prepared from this book. so I cannot give you a first hand review. But my college roommate used this book for preparation, and going by his score (329 - Verbal - 159, Quant - 170) and a few glances which I had over the book to discuss some problems with him, I can say a bit about its quality. Surely, as a standalone resource for preparation it is not enough. You should definitely use other resources for vocabulary, and mock tests apart from this book. The problem you are facing is not unusual, and that is the reason people usually prefer Magoosh or Princeton Review over Manhattan. I don\u2019t think there is a need to move to some other source for verbal, and even though it feels different, I am quite sure that the level of difficulty would be the same as that of GRE. Remember, the actual GRE exam is section adaptive, and hence in some cases when you have scored brilliant on a previous section, the next verbal section may come out to be very difficult. Hence, an overall preparation is must, which going by your statement and my friend\u2019s experience, this book will deliver. I hope I was able to answer your question. Feel free to comment here in case of other queries. Also, I would like to draw your attention to a blog post I have written describing my GRE Preparation plan, listing many free online resources and apps. You can have a look at it here. ",
