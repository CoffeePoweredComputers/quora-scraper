            "answer_text": "\u201cAggressive\u201d and \u201cKind-Hearted\u201d I am a very aggressive and overpossive in nature. I have a lot of anger that is filled inside as I had struggled a lot. Not o the basis of family problem or financial problem, but my problem was of ragging and by own classmates. This ragging had given me the tag of aggressive. I just can\u2019t control my patience and just start to fight with the other person even with my parents.  I am kind hearted as I also try to control my anger , my aggression and just try to laugh at me, it doesn\u2019t means the classmates who had made a joke on me is funny, no just because by laughing with them and involving with my friends I don\u2019t want to be angry on my own friends. And in this way I am a kind-hearted as well as short-tempered or aggressive child.  Image Source: Goggle Ps- Sorry for grammatical mistakes and Thanks for expressing me on social network! I will be glad if you will make count my mistakes and vote for my answer. ",
