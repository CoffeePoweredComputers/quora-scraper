            "answer_text": "Ok, you need to know that nuclear weapons kill in three ways, air pressure, heat and radiation. The first two do the vast majority of the killing. The pressure wave knocks down buildings and the heat wave sets them on fire. The vast majority of those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died from structural damage or from the resulting fires. At this point it is little different from an incendiary raid (which, in fact, killed far more people). It\u2019s only after this that radiation becomes a factor. Radiation exposure decreases on a distance cubed which means it falls off rapidly. This effects those who were directly exposed and those who went into the blast zone afterward, but before the first rains. Even then, the number was not all that great. Hiroshima and Nagasaki have higher than average cancer rates, but not the highest in the country. OK, back to the original question. If you are looking for the kill zone, you are looking at how far can the blast wave damage structures, and how far will the fires from the heat wave spread. As someone who lived through the Cold War, I remember this being a topic of intense debate and discussion. When you got past the fear mongers, the number that got thrown around was two miles. If you were further than that, you were probably OK. If you were closer than that, there were a lot of variables. A solid building could shield you from the blast, which was good. A not so solid building could collapse on you or catch fire, which is bad. The big killer is fire. Fire and smoke can easily kill you even the blast did little to no damage to you. Now, you could be looking for the instant kill zone. This is a LOT smaller. Most nuclear weapons explode a half mile or more up in the air. This is to allow the strongest blast wave to affect the greatest area. This means that the closest person is already a half mile from the actual center of the blast. This leads to the instant kill zone to be relatively small. The numbers I read indicated to it was often around a half mile or less from ground zero (the spot directly under the blast). In conclusion: The area of where people would be killed directly from the blast is relatively small; on the order of a half mile or so. The damage zone in which people are killed by building collapse and fire is much larger and would account for most of the casualties. Death from radiation, although horrific, accounts for only a small portion of the fatalities. Contrary to many claims, a place hit by a nuclear blast would be safe to reinhabit within a year or less in most cases. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy\u2026 here we go again with another false one-size-fits-all question. How many km can a nuclear bomb destroy? Sure.. because all nuclear bombs are exactly the same size and destroy exactly the same amount. There absolutely no different in destruction between a 20kt nuclear bomb and a 55 Megaton nuclear bomb\u2026 right? Right? Shaking my damned head. Of all the ignorance\u2026 You might as well ask, \u201chow far can a car travel on a tank of gas?\u201d It depends on the particular model of car, the efficiency of its engine, the miles per gallon it gets, the size of the particular fuel tank and how many gallons it holds, the weather and road conditions. Etc\u2026 There is no single answer to fit the question. It's the same with nuclear weapons. There is no single fixed answer to the question as you wrote it. It ignorantly assumes every nuclear bomb is exactly the same. Not only do different nuclear weapons have greater or lesser degrees of explosive power\u2026 even for an individual bomb that range of destruction can vary depending on the terrain and where and how it is detonated. Not only that\u2026 we are talking about explosive effects which do not destroy everything out to some fixed range, one meter beyond which it does not destroy anything. Explosive effects decrease as range increases. Even further\u2026 what level of force can destroy one thing, another thing can withstand. So you have to define what you mean by destroy. Destroy what exactly? Now\u2026 the very fallacy of your question aside, let me give you some insight to nuclear blast effects. There are numerous effects from a nuclear detonation, but there are three primary effects. Blast Prompt Radiation Thermal pulse In most modern nukes you can just ignore the prompt radiation. The range of the effects do not scale up the same with increasing yield of the weapon. The prompt radiation scales up the least and with most nukes, the range where you can possibly get a serious radiation dose is well inside the range in which blast and thermal pulse is going to just kill you outright. Only in very low yield nukes will you be able to possibly survive blast and thermal effects close enough for the radiation to even matter. The main destructive effect of a nuclear detonation is of course, the blast itself. This is an explosive shockwave that races outwards from the point of blast. This shockwave steadily decreases in strength the further away it gets. Shckwaves are measured. In pounds per square inch (psi) of static over pressure. This is how much the barometric pressure instantly jumps to over and above normal barometric pressure Just 1psi overpressure in a shockwave is enough to shatter a glass window pane. Some standard benchmark values\u2026 20psi: the overpressure which can destroy or severely damage steel and concrete construction buildings. Used as a standard measurement of heavy damage to a city. 5psi: the force necessary to destroy or severely damage residential wood frame construction, and light to moderate damage to steel and concrete construction, used to indicated moderate damage to a city. 1psi: windows shattered, some roofs torn off, used to indicate light damage to a city. The range at which these effects reach vary with the yield of the weapon as well as the height of burst above the ground. Even then, it is not exact. You cannot state for example that a wood framed residential house will automatically be destroyed out the the exact range of the 5psi overpressure but just beyond that it will be perfectly fine. Not only is one home not built perfectly the same as an identical home right beside it, variations in the terrain and buildings surrounding can either protect from or focus and amplify the effects of the shockwave. So one house may receive less damage and another house right beside it could get excessive damage. These are just averages. Now let's talk specifics\u2026 Let us take the most common warhead yield in the US nuclear arsenal. This is 475 Kilotons. This is the yield of all the warheads on our submarine launched nukes. As well as the most common found on the land based Minuteman III ICBM nukes We will set the height of burst to optimize the 20psi heavy damage potential. And detonate it over a city. Now here I must warn you. You will likely be disappointed. Most people tend to think nuclear weapons are many many more times powerful than the actually are in real life. Mostly thanks to Hollywood movies and anti-nuke hippie fearmongering. Don't get me wrong, they are many orders of magnitude greater than even the most powerful non-nuclear explosive\u2026 just not as big as people assume they are. Ok so here we go\u2026 {click} BOOOOOOOM\u2026 The bomb detonates at a height of 1,420m over the center of the city. The fireball expands to a radius of 720m. The fireball does not contact the ground. This limits the amount of fallout that will be generated later. Anything inside the fireball is effectively vaporized. Directly below the hypocenter the shockwave reflects off the ground and reinforces with the still expanding primary shockwave to create a much more powerful combined shockwave that races outwards, this is known as the Mach Stem effect.  Out to a range of 1.78km from ground zero, you would receive a 500rem dose of prompt radiation from the actual detonation. This is enough to induce death by radiation poisoning within about 24 hours for half the people exposed, and 15% of those that survive that would still have shortened lives and die by cancer. However, as I said above\u2026 you can ignore this because if you are this close, you're dead outright from the explosion itself. The reinforced Mach Stem shockwave will be about 20psi at a range of 2.19km from ground zero. This is where even heavily constructed steel and concrete buildings will still be destroyed or at the least, heavily damaged. Most people will not survive unless they were in underground shelters. At a range of 4.91km the shockwave has reduced down to about 5psi of overpressure. This is enough to destroy or severely damage wood framed residential construction. At 9km the thermal pulse (radiant heat from the nuclear fireball) is strong enough to 100% guarantee third degree burns to all exposed portions of the body with a direct line of sight to the fireball itself. This will reduce the further you get. By 16.2km you have a 50/50 chance of a bad sunburn, and you would be perfectly safe from any burn from the thermal pulse by 20.5km. The shockwave continue to race outwards and by 13.2km is at 1psi and just strong enough to shatter windows and damage roofs, perhaps damage the corrugated metal sheet walls of some commercial garages and shops. Note that the blast damage itself is going to be negligible beyond 14km from ground zero. That is only about 8.6 miles away from ground zero. You can be burned from the flash at greater ranges but not be hurt from the blast itself and those thermal burns are only if you are exposed to a direct line of sight to the fireball. If you are indoors or a building or wall between you and the fireball you are not getting burned. Most people think a nuke of this size will destroy everything for 20 to 30 miles or more! Lol\u2026 hardly. Even if we were to increase to a 1megaton (thats a thousand Kilotons) the nuke would still just break windows at about 20 miles. You can go to Nukemap and input whatever sized nuke you want and even place the point of detonation anywhere you want on a Google maps type interface and see just how much destruction various nukes are capable of.

            "answer_text": "You will no doubt see a variety of responses, and can search a variety of sources if you wish. But I do have something concrete to offer you sourced from the US military. I have on my book shelves an excerpt from an old US Army training manual obtained while still in service. I am photographing a page for you, but have no idea how clear it will be on your screen, so I\u2019ll point out the details. If programmed to detonate at ground level the following levels of damage are expected (if detonated at higher altitudes the surface damage ranges increase) ... A typical 5-megaton yield warhead will create a fireball 1.7 (2.7km) miles across and a ground crater about 2000 feet (600m) wide. Differences in ambient humidity and ground hardness will of course affect the size. Compare that to a 20-megaton blast, with a fireball 3 miles wide (nearly 5km) and crater 3500 feet across (over 1000m). - - - - - - The 5-megaton will cause what is technically classified as \u201ctotal destruction\u201d in a circle 3 miles out from ground zero (a full circle 6 miles or nearly 10km across). That is based upon the calculation of increased normal air pressure to every exposed surface. Within that 6 mile circle 98% of the living will die immediately. For the 20-megaton weapon, the range of \u201ctotal destruction\u201d is expected to reach 5 miles out from ground zero (8km). - - - - - The 5-megaton will cause \"heavy damage\" out to 5 miles (8km). This means collapsed or ruined buildings and structures in danger of collapsing. This term also implies 40% of the population immediately killed and 25% injured. Remember these are just the immediate effects, and do not include radiation poisoning which would be precipitated by the blast. The 20-megaton would yield \"heavy damage\" out to 7 miles (over 11km). Same terms, same percentage of human casualties. - - - - - At 7 miles, the 5-megaton would inflict \"moderate damage\u201d and most military defenders would classify it as a tolerable threat, provided they can observe traditional NBC precautions against radiation exposure. The 20-megaton causes moderate damage out to 11 miles from ground zero (over 17km). At that range a mere 5% of people exposed to the blast would likely perish immediately, only 20% injured. With added distance, the numbers fall away reassuringly from there. - - - - - The one other notable descriptor is the \"ignition radius\" or \"incendiary range\". This is the distance at which dry newspaper would combust, and represents a serious secondary danger. After any nuke event fires spontaneously break out causing further damage and injury and disruption. Theoretically the 5-megaton warhead will only combust dry papers 9 miles (over 14km) from ground zero. The 20-megaton will do so another 3 miles fartherr (out to 19km). For a 20-megaton blast, the US Army posits everything in a 300 plus square mile area will be dead, dying, collapsed, on the verge of collapsing, damaged, or set ablaze. You can see why people fear the heavy nukes.  ",

The actual *fireball* from each bomb was about 1200 feet across - and it happened almost instantaneously\u2026. The shockwave & blast radiated out for about 3 miles in every direction, causing damage, and became weaker at about that point to leave structures standing. Compare that to the bombs today - 1 megaton bombs are fairly common; 10-megaton bombs (and larger) have been detonated as well. They use nuclear fusion, and can create a fireball a few miles across. The test Ivy Mike created a crater 160 feet deep in the sea floor.

The other point to keep in mind is that if your delivery systems have improved accuracy then the yeild needed to guarantee you can destroy your target can be reduced.

Today, the largest bombs the US still has in active use top out at 1.5 megatons, and most of the deployed bombs are in the range of 100\u2013500 kilotons. It was realized that the larger sizes expended their energies at an increasing proportion of their yield into an uncaring high atmosphere and even into space. Five 100 kt bombs accomplish more than a 10 MT superweapon can for less cost, less maintenance and less bad PR. The goal of maximizing raw force is no longer a driver in military procurement - no one, other than some Asian madmen, wants to just pot-hole the planet. What was once the premier, everyone-who\u2019s-anyone-needs-a-piece-of-the-nuke-pie, is today\u2019s maintenance money drain hole, and keeping the new generation of military from enjoying the largesse that should rightfully be theirs. It\u2019s more fun to develop new toys, and perhaps even easier on the troops. ",

Also, there are neutron bombs that are designed to kill everyone beneath it and leave the infrastructure and legal paperwork, intact. ",
