            "answer_text": "A mother in law has already given the best gift to her daughter in law by giving her son for lifetime. No other gift is equivalent to this precious child of hers whom she thinks is the best in the world and carried 9 months in her womb. This gift can be bettered by raising her son as a gentleman who respects all women and treats them nicely. Apart from this, there are other gifts like inheritance or jewellery or any other materialistic gift, but none matches the gift of a fully grown child from one woman to another. Thanks Riya. ",

They are not always big gifts or expensive gifts. It's just a kind gesture to show you care about them and thinking about them, plus it makes one happy to see someone else made happy. Its little thoughts that count and makes all the difference in a relationship. ",
