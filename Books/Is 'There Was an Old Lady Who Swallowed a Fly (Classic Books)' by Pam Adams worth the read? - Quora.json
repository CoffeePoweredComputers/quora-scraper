Absolutely true. You might love a book that leaves me absolutely cold, and vice-versa. IF you are that interested in the book, I suggest you at least try ready the first 20 pages or so, see if it works for you. If not, there are tens of thousands of other books out there, just waiting for someone to pick them up and read. ",
