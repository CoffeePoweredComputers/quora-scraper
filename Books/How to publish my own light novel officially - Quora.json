Agents don\u2019t help shit, Japan\u2019s not the West)OR again, just try your hand in normal Light Novel or Literature Contests, not on web novel sites, but on the Publisher\u2019s sites. This is will be the hardest to win, cuz other authors only choose this if they are absolutely serious about debuting as an author.",

            "answer_text": "For English speakers, your best bet is to query either Vic\u2019s Lab (USA) or Armoured Fox Press (Canada) as they are the only two publishers of light novels in North America that I know of. Otherwise, you can self publish, which can be a lot harder to do (as you have to learn a lot of different skills), but you also get to keep 100% of the profits. Just be aware that Vic\u2019s Lab and AFP both have differing query methods, as AFP is closer to a standard small press and Vic\u2019s Lab selects theirs through a contest held yearly. (their forum is a good place to test the waters for your light novel as you can get instant feedback from those who are reading your novel) ",
