            "answer_text": "The books of cengage publication are no doubt very good but particularly if u talk about physical chemistry then i would suggest u that there are more better books available in the market which could be solved.And also on my personal opinion when i solved it there were many answers given were wrong. So in the my opinion if u want books for physical chemistry then here is the list: P BAHADUR: It is a very good book as referred from both Jee Mains as well advanced point of view. It consists both subjective and objective questions through which u can develop different approach for solving a problem.Also there are levels of questions which u can solve. N AWASTHI: GREAT BOOK!! If u are a serious aspirant and u believe in getting a decent rank then i would suggest u to go through this book.Though level of questions given in this book are little bit high but with help of guidance of teachers u can solve it and it is very good. RC MUKHERJEE: Again a great book.contains ample number of questions for u to develop a strong base in any physical chapters. If u aim for jee mains then i would not recommend u to solve this book but from advanced point of view u can solve this book. BEST OF LUCK!!!! ",
