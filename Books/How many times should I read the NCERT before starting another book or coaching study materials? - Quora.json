Whether u r going through any other side books it hardly matters but u must provide 2\u20133hrs perpetually on daily basis for ncert. U should arrange ur schedule such that at least u could cover some portion of both theoritical as well as numerical part and 0.5\u20131hr conditional for previous portion revision. If u could maintain this schedule than u could go for any other books or supplements. ",
