            "answer_text": "Mahabharat is not holy in any practical sense. Holyness that objects have is due to the respect you give to them. Mahabharat is an account for what happened in history, an epic to single for the valor shows by or ancestors. Some people might just disregard this by saying its just some Mythology But its not. No one is that conniving to plan out a story that intricate and write it at an immense length. It is a document that has recorded history, but overtime many rewriters have messed with the original history and edited it according to their sense. Even so, you still can think it as a holy book from your own side. Respect is what you give to someone or something. ",

            "answer_text": "Our ancient literature are split into scriptures, Itihas and secular literature. Vedas, Vednata, Puranas are scriptures. Ramayan and Mahabharata are Itihas (history) Plays, music, kama sutra etc are secular literature. Mahabharata is an epic Itihas and is an important Smruti of our ancestors. It is a history of ancient clans, kings, queens, politics, economic, art and much much more. The epic is liberally sprinkled with myths, philosophies, religious rituals and spiritual matters that were prevalent at the time. So within Mahabharata, you will find spiritual matters and sacred conversations - such as the SMB Gita. But as such, the Mahabharata is not a sacred book per se. http://www.pushti-marg.net/bhagwat/shruti-smruti.htm http://www.pushti-marg.net/bhagwat/hindu-scriptures.htm http://www.pushti-marg.net/bhagwat/Mahabharata/Mahabharata.htm http://www.pushti-marg.net/bhagwat/SMB-gita/SMB-Gita-index.htm ",
