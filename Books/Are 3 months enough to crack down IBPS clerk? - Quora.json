            "answer_text": "If you are ready to give at least 6 hours daily then it is more than enough. If you have your basics of each subject strong then it's too good & if you dont have good basics you can allot daily 1 hour to each subject - Quant, Reasoning & English. Apart from this 3 hours give 2 hours for Daily General Awareness & Statik GK portion so it won't create burden of study on you at the time of mains exam (I did the same mistake last time that I started general awareness after Pre result). Daily 1 hour to Editorial section & attempt daily quizzes from different platforms like Adda247, Gradeup, Affairscloud & Give mock tests. ",
