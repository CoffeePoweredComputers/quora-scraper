            "answer_text": "The level of difficulty to write a novel depends on the individual person.  I for one, find it extremely difficult. It is not because I don\u2019t have ideas that I am passionate about or that I am not a good enough writer. The problem is that I have too many ideas floating around in my head. I start one idea and have the desire to start a new idea before the first was completed.  I want my writing to be beautiful, to inspire and to be seen as a piece of art (which I am sure all writers want). For me that means having every character with the perfect name, the perfect background story, and the perfect personality that psychologically matches that character\u2019s background.  To cut to the chase, I over complicate and overthink everything I write. Partly due to the desire for perfection, and another part due to insecurity in my talent.  I think there are secrets to make life easier.  ORGANIZATIONThere is a time to write, and there is a time to organize your story and understand your characters. There aren\u2019t any set rules (though one would think organization should come before writing like we have been taught in school) but including an organization process will truly make like easier as well as flow more fluidly. LET IT SIT FOR A WEEKOne of my good friends once told me to think of a book idea, then wait a week before writing anything (don\u2019t be afraid to jot down notes). If you still believe it to be a good idea, go ahead.  DON\u2019T FORCE YOUR WRITING Once you start to become forceful with your thoughts and a story, it becomes apparent to the readers as well. I believe the most beautiful and fun writing is when it flows from your fingers to the paper (or keyboard).  HAVE CONFIDENCEDon\u2019t do the same mistake I do and have confidence in YOU. Insecurities show on paper, don\u2019t let that happen to you.  Don\u2019t be discouraged that writing a novel is hard for you and not for others. Unfortunately it is something that varies from one person to the other. We all think and process information in different ways. That is why it is so beautiful to read other\u2019s thoughts and words regardless how long it takes to be said. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard, I guess. I'm not published yet, but I've written a few. The 2.5 books in my bio is stating that I've only written two worth having anyone look at. I have actually written nine of them, but the first two were worthless, except for the fact that they taught me: 1.) That I was capable of finishing a novel 2.) What bad writing looked like. I went on to write five more novels that sucked, but that could be savable with an inordinate amount of editing. I wrote another that was competent, but not great. Then I wrote the best thing I've written so far. And now I'm working on the second best so far. And I'll continue to write because it's my dream, it's who I am, it's what I do. I would say that in most cases, for most writers, they write a tremendous amount of stuff that is worthless in and of itself. Ray Bradbury used to say that your first million words don't count. A million words. I agree with him. It has certainly been my experience. Sure there are the J.K. Rowlings of the world, but the chances of hitting the ground running the way she did is probably equal to the chances of winning the lottery. To truly prepare yourself to become a writer, (or a whatever else you want to be that takes significant time and energy), you have to plan for the second-to-worst-case scenario. Why 'second-to-worst-case'? Because you've got to have hope. If I never thought I would get published, or finish another novel, then what the heck and I doing this for? So, plan on it being a massive slog, a consumer of time and energies far beyond what anyone might consider as a sane investment, and continue on.  I just read The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, author of 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'. In there, he said that he was writing for 20 years before he finally sold 'Bagger Vance'. 20 years. I read that and said to myself, \"OK, if that's what it takes. I'll just have a massive amount of stuff written by then for them to choose from.\" Probably, a lot of people might say, \"20 years! Forget it!\" But I'm 46 currently. My dad is 86 and still walking around. I figure that give me 40 more years to pursue my dream. I will either become a published author, able to live on what I write, or I won't. Neither will stop me. ",
