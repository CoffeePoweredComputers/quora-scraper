            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t. The Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s institutional oaths forbid holding land and titles, but knighthood as a title is not inherently tied to hereditary powers or the expectation of passing on a line, etc. The Watch also takes part in various aspects of Westerosi society; it employs maesters and septons, for instance. So I don\u2019t think anything would legally or culturally prevent a knight from knighting other men on the Wall. If the practice doesn\u2019t seem widespread despite the implicit acceptability of it, it\u2019s probably a twofold issue: People who join the Night\u2019s Watch these days are likelier to be northmen or men of low social standing. So fewer men arrive at the Wall who are already knights (though clearly there are exceptions, like Alliser Thorne) or who would participate in knighthood in the first place. If you want an idea of how rare knights are on the Wall anymore, period, Bowen Marsh appoints a senile old man, Ser Wynton Stout, to command Castle Black in his absence for no other reason than because Stout\u2019s a knight, i.e. that\u2019s the best/only available knight around at the time. (And yes, other knights would have gone north with Mormont and been killed, but still \u2014 there were no other knights at Castle Black at that point besides this guy.)While knighthood isn\u2019t inherently tied to hereditary titles, it\u2019s still seen as a \u201ccareer-track\u201d benchmark for men who are on their way to somewhere else: heirs who will take lordships or men who want to earn money on the tourney circuit or as mercenaries, for example, or men aiming to start their own house. There\u2019s really nowhere to \u201cgo\u201d once you\u2019re in the Night\u2019s Watch and any promotions there would be (to first ranger, for example) aren\u2019t reliant on knighthood. It wouldn\u2019t help rangers make inroads with or against the wildlings, either; wildlings don\u2019t care if someone\u2019s a knight and might even mock someone who is. So the practical utility of being knighted is essentially nil, and in that case, there\u2019s much less reason to bestow it or to seek it out.",
