            "answer_text": "The body is the vessel we occupy, and, the soul is who we primarily are, that resides in the body. And, our spirit involves our attitude & emotions. We are body, soul & spirit. In reference to food being an offering to the soul, we are not to ever worship anyone or anything except our Creator-God, who is God the Father, God the Son, (who is our Lord & Saviour Christ-Jesus), God the Holy Spirit - - - ONE GOD in three persons. Because all other gods are of the devil, who\u2019s name is satan, disguised in many forms to deceive mankind, to assure we will always be sinful & belong to him, and end in Hell as satan hates us like no other possibly can and brings upon us: disease, murder, heartbreak, lying, stealing, murder, starvation, aging, death, suicide, shootings, human trafficking, natural disasters, secular religions, divorce, child abuse, over-eating, war, rape, financial stress & ruin, conceit, gossip, sexual sins, and every misery known to mankind. Our sin separated us from our Father-God & hurled us \u201cover the fence\u201d into satan's domain. But we can be Reconciled to our Father-God & His protection when we decide to trust His Word, the Holy Bible, and are Saved from our sins through the works of our Lord & Saviour Christ-Jesus. This is the one & only way to be Saved from Hell & Reconciled to our Father-God. To gain the accuracy of what His Word actually says & deep-seated understanding, there are CERTAIN Bible scholars who are incredibly interesting to hear on YouTube & TV mostly on Sundays from around 8am-1pm: David Jerimiah, Rick Warren, Joseph Prince, John Hagee, Jonathan Hagee, Charles Stanley, Joyce Meyer, Creflo Dollar, Joel Osteen, Jonathan Bernis, James Dobson, Sid Roth, Nola Levitz, Perry Stone, Gregory Dickow, Hal Lindsey, Adrian Rogers, Tony Evans, Samuel Rodriguez, Michael Youseff, Ron Carpenter, Brian Houston, James Kennedy, Jack Hayford, Jentzen Franklin, Jerry Falwell, Jonathan Falwell, Billy Graham, Franklin Graham, Ann Graham-Lotz, Pat Robertson & Gordon Robertson of the 700 Club.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a different idea. I thought food sustains the body. Who is it that would be offering food to my soul? Me? But I am my soul. Body and soul, precisely. Not one to the exclusion of the other. Is this idea like a religious person leaving money in the poor box at church? Do you think people worship their souls like Hollywood worships the body? Perhaps, but I am certain I\u2019m not a divine being. I have a beginning and an end. Even if that end leads to life everlasting, there is much to existing as a human that is beyond my control. To each his own, I suppose, but I cannot fathom why food would be an offering to one\u2019s soul. ",
