            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what \u2018can it be\u2019 exactly means. Sentience exists on the Earth (at least arguably). Is your question \u201ccould the bulk of the physical mass of the Earth be a single sentient organism?\u201d I don\u2019t know, but organisms are generally thought of as having a metabolism, growth, reproduction, and some degree of active responsiveness to their environment. In that sense it doesn\u2019t SEEM like the Earth itself qualifies. I don\u2019t see it reacting to conditions in its environment in a biological way (but this is a deep question, so maybe it has room for other answers). I don\u2019t see growth or metabolism either. The Earth certainly doesn\u2019t reproduce! Are all of these traits \u2018cryptic\u2019 (IE hidden, maybe because they take so long to happen). I guess you cannot utterly rule it out, but there\u2019s no evidence AFAIK in favor. I suppose \u2018sentient\u2019 COULD be decoupled from \u2018alive\u2019 and \u2018organism\u2019. That is to say, could the Earth be thought of as a system which processes and analyzes information? I don\u2019t know, but without any ability to act, metabolism, etc. what would be the purpose of such information processing/sentience? How would it arise? I don\u2019t see any kind of possible path to \u2018natural selection\u2019 amongst planets, so what would be the pathway? Now, maybe you are more interested in the idea of a \u2018world consciousness\u2019 or something that exists within living organisms in the biosphere. That would be a bit different question, and is maybe closer to what Lovelock was trying to push way back when. The problem with that hypothesis is basically the same. There\u2019s no plausible way to see how it could \u2018evolve\u2019, and no sign that it actually exists. Even Dr Lovelock himself has largely abandoned this hypothesis, and retreated to some much more limited positions that still seem implausible to me. I think there is some validity in ideas like the sum of living things DOES COMPUTATION. That is to say, there could be \u2018meta evolution\u2019, such as \u2018evolving to evolve better\u2019 which could happen at a scale above that of species and individuals. I don\u2019t think, if that were true, it would be best described as an \u2018organism\u2019 however. ",

            "answer_text": "Author Frederick Phol had a series of books that included sentient stars. With the billions and trillions of stars in a Galaxy and trillions of galaxies, there may be one star that had a pattern of swirling gas that was able to communicate with it's self and become sentient. The first one I read was the world at the end of time. That star could project the pattern to make other objects sentient and it did this at least one time to a planet. I don't think there is a away to prove that this is impossible so, I think the answer to your question is yes. Read the book, it's pretty good science fiction. You could also mean a planet wide conciousness. Our brains are just made up of nuron cells that communicate with each other. Different parts if the brain have different functions and sub systems. Some of which monitor the brain it's self. This feedback system makes it self aware and once the system is complex enough, you get conciousness which is an identity greater than the sum of it's parts. It's no longer a lump of brain matter but a person. Our global society is doing the same thing. People communicate with other people all across the Earth with complex information. There are groups that study human actions for feedback. Perhaps just like nurons in the brain have no idea there is a \u201cyou\u201d as they just go about their jobs, we have no idea that there is a planet wide conciousness that is directing us that we each are a little part of. I go into more depth on my website - the god particle if you look that up with my name. ",
