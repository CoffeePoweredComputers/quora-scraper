My younger brother gave ANTHE\u201919 for 8th Standard and he was pretty happy with his performance as well as the question paper. He appeared in CBT mode and found everything at ease. As per him, 10% of questions were tricky but 90% were in a straightway format. We are hoping the best for his rank though. ",
