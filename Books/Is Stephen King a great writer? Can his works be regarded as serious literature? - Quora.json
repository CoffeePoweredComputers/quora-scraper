            "answer_text": "Stephen King does not consider himself a great and who am I am to argue with that. I think he is a VERY good writer. He in not in the same league as Shakespeare, Chaucer, Thomas Moore, and Thoreau. I would say he is good company with Edgar Allen Poe, Washington Irving, Ray Bradbury, and Issac Asimov. His works are entertainment even pulp fiction- not serious literature. There are notable ones like: The Stand and Nov 22, 1963. There are many iconic ones that will live on in pop culture for some time like: The Shining and It. I am sure that his works will still be read beyond his lifetime. I think that I am lucky to have been born in the same century as Stephen King and have been able to follow his work for decades. I am not sure if any one other single writer has ever been able to write as much in their lifetime and he is not done yet! I think he may the most notable for the most published works/words of any writer to date. His writing spans two different centuries in a huge way in both. That is an accomplishment! That is the one sure aspect that could categorize him as \u201cgreat\u201d. The sheer volume of what he has written will surely live on and be read beyond his lifetime perhaps at least until the next century. Whether or not his writing will survive into the next century is anyone\u2019s guess because we cannot now who the next prolific writer will be. I think if nothing else being a prolific reader of Stephen King that he has painted a longstanding portrait of American life/pop culture thereof from the second half of the 20th Century and the beginning of the 21st Century. I think that American Culture of this time period could be studied in part through his novels in the future. ",

            "answer_text": " Will critics and academics ever regard Stephen King\u2019s novels as literature? My answer, based on a scientific wild-assed guess, is yes. Let me tell you why. I read \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot and The Shining years ago. Both novels were page-turners. Hard to put down. Of course I was younger and dumber then, but Stephen King had me hooked. So why did I stop reading Stephen King\u2019s novels? Because King was too good at his craft. I can\u2019t bear to read horror fiction. Real life is horrifying enough as it is. But there are readers who can\u2019t get enough of fear. Like the horror fiction aficionados who revere H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937). After Lovecraft died in poverty, his posthumous reputation grew. Today the author of At the Mountains of Madness and The Shadow Out of Time has a cult following. But what\u2019s the point of succeeding after death? Stephen King has been lucky that way. He\u2019s been able to enjoy his success. The question is, is he a great writer? And can you call his novels literature? It\u2019s rare for a writer to win recognition as a literary artist in his or her lifetime. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald had that distinction. So did Raymond Chandler. Later, critics awarded literary laurels to J.D. Salinger, Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut. Also Norman Mailer, James Jones, Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Saul Bellow and John Updike. Will people read their books for pleasure in the next century? I like to think that some of these writers\u2019 books will outlive them, their children and grandchildren. One hopes Catch-22, Slaughterhouse-Five and Burr will still enchant readers a hundred years hence. Novels and novelists go in and out of vogue. Great books fall into two categories. There are books one reads in a dutiful manner. One feels satisfaction after performing a chore. It\u2019s like visiting a friend in the hospital. And then there are books one reads for guilty pleasure. This is something even high-minded readers do. Don\u2019t believe me? Dig into Ayn Rand\u2019s fawning epistolary relationship with Mickey Spillane. Rand loved Spillane\u2019s Mike Hammer novels. She even went on the record with her admiration for the creator of Kiss Me, Deadly and My Gun is Quick. In The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature, Ayn Rand puts Mickey Spillane up there with Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo. I may be the only person on the planet who thinks Alan LeMay\u2019s The Searchers is the great American novel. Or that James T. Farrell\u2019s Studs Lonigan trilogy runs a close second. Then comes James Jones\u2019s The Thin Red Line, and Larry McMurtry\u2019s epic Lonesome Dove. Does Stephen King belong on Olympus with them? I know people who say he does. Stephen King\u2019s best-seller On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft is candid and conversational. It\u2019s required reading on some college campuses. So he\u2019s starting to earn the kind of respect that academics accord great writers. That could be because King sells a lot of books, of course. But Stephen King is also a great storyteller. And great storytelling never goes out of style. It would be interesting to learn what King himself thinks of his corpus of creepy fiction. He was self-deprecating to a fault in early interviews, downplaying the literary significance of his fiction. In Jill Krementz\u2019s wonderful book The Writer\u2019s Desk, Stephen King says, \u201cI\u2019m a salami writer. I try to write good salami, but salami is salami. You can\u2019t sell it as caviar.\u201d Image: Tony Hisgett | CC BY 2.0 ",
