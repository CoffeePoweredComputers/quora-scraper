            "answer_text": "according to Rowling the character of Harry Potter is straight. Since she is the person who created him I think we have to go with what she says. But there were times in the series I suspected he might have been. The only person she has come out and actually revealed their sexuality was Albus Dumbledore as being gay. There is nothing in the books or movies that makes anyone\u2019s sexual preference relevant except the love between Snape and Lily and that isn\u2019t about sexuality it is about love. ",
