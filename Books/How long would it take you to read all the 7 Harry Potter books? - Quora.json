            "answer_text": "This is not an answer about the length of time it takes to read. That is entirely up to each individual\u2019s reading style. If you\u2019re a quick reader \u2026 or if you have dyslexia \u2026 will obviously make a difference. If you commute or read them on holidays that will vary too. Some people skim for meaning \u2026 some people read every word out aloud in their head. Some people read the book/s to their children \u2026 out loud \u2026 every word \u2026 with inflection and dramatisation! I have read the entire series in less than a week while communing on the train to and from work. However, the most recent time I\u2019ve read the books, I started on 3 December 2018 and I am still on the early chapters of the final book now (9 April 2019)! In the many years since the books were released, it has taken varying lengths of time for me to read (which I do at least annually). However, when the books were released after three or two years, then I had to re-read the earlier books. I started the first book after the second book was released. But I read the books more quickly, as the time went on and the Potter-mania grew. When the Half-Blood Prince was released, I had to wait for the book store to get enough copies \u2026 a breakfast radio announcer read the first page or so of chapter 1 \u201cThe Other Minister\u201d on air and discussed the Potter-mania! It was agonising for me \u2026 and because I\u2019d heard the opening, it was even worse to have to wait. But except for being able to read The Philosopher\u2019s Stone and The Chamber of Secrets in quick succession, I had to wait at least a year between each book being published. There was three years between the Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix and two years each between Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. What did people (including me) do in those longer intervening publications? Read the earlier books again, read other literature, plough through tomes like the Lord of the Rings \u2026? People who weren\u2019t there at the time have little idea what it was like to have to wait! Play Clash of Clans (?). How about now? Sometimes I read for detail (which takes much longer). Sometimes I take notes or write in the margins (only in my \u2018working copies\u2019 of the books\u2014yes I have three sets of the books and 5 copies of Deathly Hallows). Sometimes, I make extensive quotes and references \u2026 sometimes making psychological observations for my dissertation (which takes ages!) \u2026 sometimes I just read for the sheer pleasure of literature while I continue other activities (this current reading). If you read each book, and then watch the movie, in \u2018reading order\u2019 \u2014 that can be a very interesting (and rewarding) experience. But if you want the challenge like those of us who were with Harry from the start (or at least from early on), try to read the books and have to wait for the publication intervals. Have a real experience of what it was like 20 years ago or so. I am sure this is more than you bargained for \u2026 but you can read as slowly or as quickly as you like or are able. But once you are hooked, it is possible that it will take the rest of your lifetime to read the books! ",

It depends upon how fast someone can read, how much free time they have, how much time they want to give to it, and how much they enjoy the series. Me, personally, I read the entire series in a week.
