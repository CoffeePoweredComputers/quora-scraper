This varies considerably between adult\u2019s books and children\u2019s books. ",

            "answer_text": "For a novella, the word count range is somewhere from 17,000 words to 40,000 words. Novellas don't generally have more than 100 pages, but that can differ depending on font and stuff. For a novel, the range is generally 40,000 to 100,000 (the upper limit might be more depending on the genre). But this range isn't fixed, and depends on the genre and the publishing houses. For different genres, word count limit is different. Like for thriller it might be 100,000, but for romance it's somewhere 60,000 to 80,000. Even publishing houses have a set length for genres and formats, and accordingly books are selected and edited to match up with the limits. Hope this helps :) ",
