            "answer_text": "Agh, i have several. My favorite is probably John Greens Paper Towns, but i literally could not describe it because it can be interpreted so many ways. So my second is \u2018There is a boy in the girls bathroom\u2019 by Louis Sachar. I am probably too old to read it because i am like 15 and it is for like primary school kids but i think it\u2019s amazing. The plot is basically - there is a kid nobody likes Bradley and Bradley is so insecure that he bullies everyone and nobody likes him, but he really wants a friend. So this new kid come to his school (Jeff) and Jeff is kind to him and tries to be his fiend. He also gets a guidance counselor (Carla) and he slowly opens up to her throughout the book and she helps become a better person and to be kind and he really relies on her to help him. He even gets invited to a party. But at the end of the book Carla leaves and it is devastating. He depended on her and now she is gone. She helped him so much though and he now has a ton of friends and worked through his anger issues, but omg i cry everytime, she leaves him a note and argh it is so sad. ",

            "answer_text": "Mahabharatham is my all time favorite. It contains adventure, humor, romance, lust, mystery and so many characters to review, analyse and is thought provoking, It is long enough and has so many sub stories to keep you interested for more than a month of reading. But so many questions about the flow and logic and events to ponder over for years maybe a lifetime. It tells you and shows you so many things about life that still is real and relevant. The massive work makes you awestruck. The way it is intricately handled makes you amazed. The sheer volume is staggering. There never was, is and will be another like Mahabharatham for the depth of stories, characters, subjects, range and power. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite book is \u201cThus Spoke Zarathustra,\u201d by Friedrich Nietzsche. The book is a parody of ethical dualism\u2014i.e., good vs. evil\u2014which was first propounded by the Persian prophet Zarathustra. The parody exists on several levels. Since Zarathustra was the first religious teacher to assert ethical dualism, Nietzsche tapped him to be the first to renounce it. The language of the book parodies the language of the Bible, as do its teachings. (Compare, e.g., Nietzsche\u2019s beatitudes to Christ\u2019s.) Even the structure of the book is a parody. Its four parts mimic the four parts of ancient Greek tragedies as they were presented in ancient Athens\u2014three tragic plays followed by a farce. In order to replace the life=negating (nihilistic) teachings of ethical dualism, Nietzsche offers us the Ubermensch, the will to power, and eternal return. And then, to counter his own nihilism, Nietzsche followed this book with \u201cBeyond Good and Evil\u201d\u2014\u201dwhich says the same thing as my \u2018Zarathustra,\u2019 only differently, very differently.\u201d ",
