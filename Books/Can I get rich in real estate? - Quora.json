            "answer_text": "here are a few real estate investing strategies to grow your income and assets through investment properties: 1. Fix and Flip - The first answer to the question how to get rich in real estate is for those who are not looking forward to becoming landlords by renting out their income properties for an indefinite period of time. Instead, it is for those more dynamic individuals interested in short-term investments and who like to buy a property, fix it, and then flip it \u2013 i.e., resell it for a price higher than the price they purchased it for. The trick is to identify a property which requires only minimal \u2013 and cheap \u2013 fixes to maximize its value. 2. Positive Cash Flow to Pay Off Mortgage - Maybe fix and flip does not sound like your road on how to get rich in real estate? If you are not this dynamic type of person and would like to buy rental properties that you keep for at least a few years, then you should always aim for such properties that generate enough cash flow to pay off their own monthly mortgage payments. 3. Positive Cash Flow to Pay Off Mortgage on Another Property The next method of how to get rich in real estate is somewhat related to number 2. In this case, if you have a rental property the mortgage for which has been already paid (or which you purchased in cash), you use the positive cash flow from this property to save up a down payment for another property and then to pay off the mortgage of the second property.

            "answer_text": "There is a number of ways to make money through real estate. To invest, you should consult with a licensed adviser. I\u2019ve personally made and will make money in three different ways. Read my book to know more about this. Either way, the 3 ways are buy and hold, fix and flip and a Real Estate company. Buy and hold and some similarities to investing in stocks, bonds or other investments. You get a return on your investment, assuming that you can rent the property out. How good the deals are depend on many factors, such as the market value vs acquisition cost, find the right tenants, etc. I have specialized in this and built a Real Estate portfolio with 10 units, which I show here. Fix and flip basically means that you buy distressed properties, you add some value to them by renovating them and you sell them for a profit. I\u2019ve done a deal like this before and I am looking forward to do more like them. A Real Estate company mediates RE deals. This means that you promote and sell other people\u2019s homes for a commission. My company is specialized in finding properties for investors. Note that regardless of how you get into Real Estate, there is risk involved, as in any investment. If you liked this post, follow me on Quora and on Facebook for more. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, here is the deal - you can be very very wealthy - faster than you think. Me and some partners run a site - Home - we literally get 100\u2019s of possible deals a day for penny\u2019s on the dollar. There are deals we have got that literally cost under $20,000 and cash flow $800 per month. If you were to buy one of these a year for the next 40 years you would have a ton of equity and even more cash flow. Cash flow is what you want. Now listen to this - this is very important - get a ROTH IRA account. You can pay taxes going in, then invest in a self directed fund, buy all your homes and boom, all that cash flow is tax free. A conventional IRA or 401K is tax deferred, which is nice if you don\u2019t have cash flow when you retire. MOST people do not have cash flow when they retire, they move to a tiny tax rate and do alright. This will not be you if you are cash flowing correctly :) ",
