            "answer_text": "Here in the UK it wouldn\u2019t be a problem legally , as the age of consent is 16 . Socially, some people might not approve , but as many will accept it . She has a lot on her plate at 16 . School , all the usual woman body image stuff , relationships with parents and all sorts of romantic and sexual thoughts and feelings swirling around . You , on the other hand , have grown up a bit more and maybe have a long term relationship and settling down on your horizon - that won\u2019t be on her agenda . I had my first relationship many years ago and we were in the age age range that you and this girl are now . She was very passionate , good company, but became more than a little crazy emotionally \u2014 more so than other girls of her age I think . We spent at least one night together every weekend at my place - to start off with she pretended she was staying at a girlfriend\u2019s house after a party , but soon her parents knew and accepted what was going on . So my guess is you would have a rather unpredictable, high energy time with Ms 16 , that might well not last , or you can seek out someone a bit older and calmer . But love and attraction aren\u2019t neatly timetabled to fit in with what is expected or normal or even advisable. She may be a more down to earth normal person . In the end , it\u2019s how you fit together . That\u2019s not meant in a sexual way - it\u2019s how your personalities vibrate with each other and you\u2019re not going to know that until you know her a bit more . What would I do if I were you , without having met either of you ? . Proceed with caution. But once you\u2019ve close , you\u2019ll loose all sense of rationally. I still have some warm memories of those two years , around 68 / 70 \u2014 but I still bear the scars . ",

            "answer_text": "I belonged to a church that somewhat encouraged people too date within their ranks. I was24 at the time and she was 16. We dated and we're very open about it. That's been a lifetime ago and when I look at girls that age or a few years older now I see children. I would never advise it, there are many pitfalls. I actually went to her prom. I didn't care at the time but I bet I had a few looks. Any young person at that age are just boiling raging hormone and their decision making skills are not fully developed. ",
