            "answer_text": "The question isn't clear. Do you want to invest in UAE stock or do you want to invest in stocks while you are in UAE. Plus you don't mention how much or for how long. a) investing in UAE. Depends on where you are. If you are in UAE then you have multiple option with Emirates Bank, ADCB, Mubasher, Saxo Bank etc etc. Some one mentioned, iShares MSCI UAE, I personally wouldn't do that because if you look deeper, you will learn that it is not diversified. Too heavily dependent on Financials. So if financials go down than the ETF will go down. Rule #1) be diversified. If you are outside UAE, it will all depend on the broker options you have and the markets they trade in. Sorry, can't help you there. b) if you want to invest in stocks while you are in UAE. Globally and Locally, then two options you have are Mubasher and Saxo Bank. I use Mubasher for global and local. Best thing would be to start with US market, due to its sophistication. Use your knowledge to invest in local markets.  In fact with a long term horizon like 15 years the probability of gettig an average return of 7% per year is very very high. With that in mind you could double your amount in 10 years if you consider the impact of compounding interest. The average person can make money over the long haul, if you buy S&P 500 Index or ETF. Below amount in $ but you could do the same for any currency. 1) Start with a fake account on Investopedia. This will give you some sense of what it feels like when yiur stock goes up or down. Do this for a while. Start with $10,000 and $9.99 commission. That's fairly realistic. 2) learn learn learn learn learn. this can be done through different channels. Investopdeia, listen to different shows Jim Cramer (show or podcast) All shows from Motley Fool, personal finance. 3) Research companies you like/know. Go through yahoo finance. List at least 10 companies in 5 different industries. Diversify. 4) it's earning season, lisen to earnings calls of the companies you like/know. See what they say, how the market reacts, find out why it reacts that way. 5) investing is a long term game. Don't put in anything that you need in the next 5 years. 6) listen to people about personal finance. Like Suzy Q or Dave Ramsey or both. No point in investing if you are losing money through other sources. Good luck. @harisarshad #notanexpert  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, You can buy stocks in UAE.  'Stocks' or 'shares' are frequently used interchangeably. I will use share. Top Online Stock Brokers Review - Buy Stock In order to raise funding for a company, it issues shares either publicly or privately. The shares represent a 'share' of the company's ownership (equity shares) or a promise to pay a specified dividend and specific intervals (preferred shares). Only the initial transaction provides funding to the company. Subsequent trades provide profit or loss to the successor holders. Privately traded shares are harder to resell than publicly traded shares and most of what you read/hear about are publicly traded shares available through the main stock markets (NYSE/NASDAQ/LSE etc). The purpose of these stock exchanges and secondary share selling is that it makes the first sale (IPO - initial public offering) that provides funding to the company more attractive to the initial investor because they are reassured they will be able to get their money out later. \"Common stocks/ordinary shares\" represent a (each usually minute) share of the company's equity/ownership. A dividend may, but does not have to be, paid to the owners of record of each share. Growing companies often do not, instead plowing the profits back into growth and acquisitions and with luck the value of the share goes up as a result (capital gain when sold) - a so called growth stock. Mature companies often issue dividends that represent a share of the profits of the company back to the 'owners' - ie shareholders and the value of their shares are frequently more stable - thus considered dividend stocks by classification because the reason for holding is related more to the stream if dividend income rather than capital gains. Share price fluctuations of these stocks do occur and may also give rise to capital gains/losses. Preferred shares trade according to their yield (annual dividend payout vs cost per share) more like a debt instrument (bond) rather than their share price, although this can vary as well. There may be 'covenants' attached to the preferred share issue that allows the company to redeem the shares under specified conditions without the consent of the holder so they require a bit more attention when purchasing to know what you are getting into. The price should be more stable but be aware s**t happens here as well. Some of the other answers have started into the perils of selecting particular company shares to invest into and they are right - it requires knowledge and discipline. If your knowledge of investing is as nascent as you imply, consider alternative investments such as mutual funds and ETFs to get started with. By holding shares in many more companies than you would likely be able to economically hold at the outset, the risk is spread out and your gains/losses will be less precipitous. This way you will have 'skin in the game' to pique your interest as you learn about markets and market fluctuation. ",
