            "answer_text": "The question asked is: How can I make money from my self published free e-book? The e-book is free so you obviously can't make money from that. However, you could have a landing page to harvest e-mail adresses from people wanting to download the e-book and the e-book itself could serve as an introduction. Either you have some paid content ready (more in-depth e-books or something else) for those wanting to know more or it can lead to someone paying a service or paying you in particular for the benefit you can bring. That's all I can think of for now. Feel free to comment. Related link: What are all the ways to monetize an ebook?  ",

            "answer_text": "It is against Amazon\u2019s TOS to put affiliate links in your ebook, so don\u2019t. The only way to make money from a free book is to use it as a funnel to other products. For example, if you write a series, you can make Book 1 free, and readers who like Book 1 will go on to buy the rest of the series. As someone else noted, you can also use a free ebook to boost your mailing list sign-ups. But again, the only purpose in having a mailing list is so that you get them to buy something in the future. That means having other products. Free books are loss leaders, and they allow a customer to try an unknown author without any risk. But a free book alone won\u2019t bring you any money. ",

One good way is to convert book into a mobile app that would also sell related services and content and continue to provide community experience. That is what I have done with some of my books and they still dont make ton of money.  ",
