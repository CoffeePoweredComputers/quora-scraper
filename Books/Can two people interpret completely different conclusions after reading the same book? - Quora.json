            "answer_text": "Yes. There is high possibility that two different readers can interpret their own conclusions from the same book. This is a strong argument if you are talking about Fiction books. The idea depends on a lot of factors. The mindset of a person, his culture, his education, his childhood, etc. One of the two (or more) would like the protagonist, justify his actions, personify his ambitions and spread his examples. The other one, may or may not agree with the first one. According to him, the protagonist could be vigilante, his actions to be of criminal intent, his ambitions to be personal vengeance and his example a  bad analogy. However, if we move towards Non Fiction, this has less chances of holding truth. Non Fiction books presents a real life or real time account in a logical format, implying that they present what's usually rife and legit. People can form different opinion for Non Fiction books too, but the probability is less when compared to fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. \"There are no facts, only interpretations.\" \"There is no reality, but perceptions.\" How you interpret a book would solely depend on your thinking power, how you perceive the idea, how you look at the whole thing. For example, consider the following saying:- \"If you think you are a winner, you are THE winner.\" One perception of the above-statement is: If you think you will win, you will win. Since brain is the main stem for our every achievement. Once you make it believe that you are going to win, it will not be afraid of the other competitors. And a confident brain can lead you to success.  The second way to look at it is: If you think you are a winner, you are a winner, even if you lose. The lose will not affect your confidence. It will consider the lose as a minor setback and would tell you not to worry. You can win ANYTIME you want.  If this is the case with a simple sentence, what it would be with books. For example, there are many conclusions about the book THE ALCHEMIST. My conclusion about it is \"you have dig your inner-self to find the treasure. Keep on exploring to be a winner, to dig out the wealth hidden in our subconscious selves.\" You may Google for other conclusions. Thank you for the A2A Suraj. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally, there can be two different results. What I think it is because of the reading styles. Some people who are avid readers or someone who are literature students will interpret book in a complete different than someone who is a plain reader. I have observed the changes in myself, being with avid readers I have cultivated the habit of reading book in various ways, and understanding between the lines. You can say understanding the concept behind writing; which plays the very important role.  Some people don't like The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, they find it too simple and rubbish. Some people found Animal Farm by George Orwell as children book. What they don't know that one book is talking about absurdism, existential crisis, inner transformation and the other book is talking about Russian politics.   ",
