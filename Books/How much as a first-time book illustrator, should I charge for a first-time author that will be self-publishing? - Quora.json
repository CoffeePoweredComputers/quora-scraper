            "answer_text": "You can find comparisons for illustrators and I found this recommended video for you to figure out how to price your work. How to price your illustrations video The Laura Wood Illustration website seems to also be a wealth of information. From my experience as a micro publisher of a few children\u2019s books I also recommend that if you like the book you are illustrating and think it has potential that you consider working on a percentage. You are new at this and your author is new at it. What may happen is you become successful and share in a prosperous project into perpetuity. If you do it as a work for hire and the book is successful you will see no further income from it. I am an entrepreneur so I always look for the things that could bring a long term result even if it requires an investment of my sweat and skill in the present time. If you need the immediate income as all of us do, then you can ask for a reasonable investment by the author. You can also consider discounting the amount to retain some type of percentage for the life of the work. Make sure to get all of this in writing even if you are the best of friends. Friendships can go south but royalties can be forever. ",

            "answer_text": "You should review market rates for the type of work involved, then go slightly under them, depending on how much experience you have in exactly what you will be doing. Get the specs on the work, find out from the client what he or she needs from the illustrations. Do the best job you can possibly do, really shine, and charge per what you think your time and efforts are worth. ",
