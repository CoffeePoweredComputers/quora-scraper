            "answer_text": "Lots of work. :) A slow writer will produce 500 words an hour or so. A fast writer might be able to use dictation to get as much as 5000 words per hour. I tend to average about 2500 words per hour typed. With dictation I usually go over 3000 words per hour, but have added cleanup time that usually erases the difference. Why the focus on words per hour? Because that directly impacts your speed of writing. The more good, clean, well written prose someone can produce per hour, the faster they will hit 100 books. Book length matters, too. Someone might write 100 short nonfiction titles more rapidly than someone else reaches 100 doorstopper epic fantasy novels, for example. Assuming a range of 50k-150k per book, that 500WPH writer will take 100\u2013300 hours per book. For me, it\u2019s more like 20\u201360 hours per book. For the fastest dictation based writers out there, it\u2019s 10\u201330 hours per book. That doesn\u2019t include any time spent on research, outlining, revision, edits, etc. But those elements are more or less static: if it takes us say 50 hours per book for those tasks, whether we write the book in a week or a year, we will still need to put in all 50 hours. As a full time writer, I tend to write at least a book a month. That\u2019s not hard; it\u2019s just hours spent butt in chair getting the work done. When I was still full time in a day job, it was MUCH harder. I only did a couple of books a year back then. Finding time to commit to writing was much more difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "They do it one book at a time. Extreme focus, great organizational skills, and the motivation to see a project through to the end. It takes great discipline to write a book. Few people work on multiple books at a time and complete any of them. So authors that complete 100 books must focus intensely on one project at a time. They usually write about topics they\u2019re already familiar with, so it takes less research, and in a discipline where they are currently working. I\u2019m talking about nonfiction authors. Authors of fiction exercise the same discipline but use their imaginations and maintain a high level of productivity. Once you complete a book that provides decent enough passive income to live on, you can spend all of your time working on your next book instead of working nights and weekends and taking time away from the family. That makes it easier to write more books. If you\u2019re good, you can complete two to four books per year. Plus, some authors use ghostwriters. If you make enough money, you can employ two or three ghostwriters. That helps you produce more books. Even one ghostwriter means you can write one while the hired hand writes the other. The more you produce, the more you can earn. ",
