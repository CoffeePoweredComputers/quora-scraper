            "answer_text": "The most popular writer in Japan is Keigo Higashino. He mainly writes mystery novels. But he does it better than most mystery writers who write in English. He even wins major literary awards. Overall, he is a much better writer than Stephen King. He has a rare ability to write natural-sounding dialogue, and he uses this ability to sharply delineate his characters, which are more 3-dimensional and realistic than the characters you normally find in mystery novels and popular fiction in general. I\u2019m not sure whether such dialogue would translate well into English though. While he doesn\u2019t write horror, a few of his non-mystery novels feature some interesting supernatural elements. He is extraordinarily prolific, having so far published about 50 novels plus a few collections of short stories. His short stories are of extremely high quality. ",
