            "answer_text": "I am assuming that the mirrors are perfectly parallel with each other - so that the light can bounce between them forever. In principle, it would be infinitely many times. In real life, a bit of light is lost every time it is reflected. An ordinary mirror reflects about 85 to 90% of the light that falls on it. That means about 10 to 15% of the light is lost. The remaining amount of light for a mirror with 90% reflectivity would of course be: [math]I = 0.9^n[/math] Where I is the amount of light and n is the number of times the light has been reflected. The number gets smaller and smaller as n gets larger and larger: n= 1, I = 0.9 n = 10, I = 0.35 n = 100, I = 0.000027 (numbers rounded to to significant figures) By the time you get to the 100th reflection, there is only about 3 hundred thousandth the original light intensity. It would probably be so dim you can\u2019t really see it - and it will get only dimmer. In practice, the light light will eventually disappear altogether, as it goes down to the last photon. You can\u2019t have any light less than a photon. But how many mirror images you can see depends on the reflectivity of the mirror, how much light there was to start with, and how well you can detect low levels of light. Even the sensitivity of your eyes will vary. Thanks for asking. ",
