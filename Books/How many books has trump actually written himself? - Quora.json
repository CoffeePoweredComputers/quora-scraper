            "answer_text": "That is easy. Trump never wrote a book. He does not have the ability or the patience to do that !! He hired someone else to write a book, THE ART OF THE DEAL. I heard the author, Tony Schwartz speak. He is guilt ridden, and wishes he had never helped Trump write the book!! He fears he may have helped him become president. They are not friends anymore, like so many people Trump just dropped when they were no longer useful for him. Having worked with Trump, Mr. Schwartz explained how difficult and erratic he was to work with, and never thought this incompetent, conceited self-promoter would ever have become president !! I HAVE BEEN WATCHING TRUMP NOW FOR THREE YEARS, AND ALL I CAN DO IS RAISE THE ALARM BELL. We need to get this criminal out of the White House !!! Perhaps join \u201cNeed to impeach with TOM STEYER\u201d. or work hard to vote in democrats. I really am convinced that our country may be in danger under Trump. ",

He did not write any of \u201chis\u201d other books, and has very probably not read any of them, either. Trump publishes books to burnish his fraudulent image as a successful businessman. If you read his Tweets, you know he is barely literate. If you listen to his speeches, it\u2019s clear he can barely read, since he strays from the teleprompter often and struggles with very basic words. He does not write books. Never has, never will. Because he can\u2019t. ",
