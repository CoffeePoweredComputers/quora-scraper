            "answer_text": "Read, read, read, read. And not just any tutorial site. Read blog posts, and books by people who are considered the greatest in the PHP field. Find out why php was created, what problem it was meant to solve, and find out where it is now and you\u2019ll see that it has evolved into a beast of its own. Once you get a feel for the syntax (if you know at least one other language this should take you very little time) start programming. Write as much software as you can. Command line apps, graphics, web stuff, do the tutorials for some of the well known frameworks like Zend Framework, Symfony, Laravel, tear them apart, see what they have in common. Try to solve problems that the language was clearly not designed to solve. Go program a little with other languages. See why people prefer Python, or Node (javascript), Ruby, over PHP. Write an API. Consume an API. Automate a deployment. Write a unit test with PHPUnit. Try Behat. Programming a language, no matter how much you do it, will not make you a master. You need to take what you\u2019ve done, show it to people who know A LOT more than you do about the language and ask for suggestions. This is not enough. You need to take their suggestions and LEARN about them. Why did they chose to do things differently than you did? What were the problems they encounter in their learning path that led them to suggest that you solve this particular problem differently? If you can, go to conferences and go to as many talks as possible. Go to talks that are targeted to the same level as you are right now and talks that go way over your head. Go to the PHP source code. Find out what the heck a \u201czval\u201d is. Why it is incredibly powerful, or why it sucks. Try to write an extension to the language. Try to even make and compile your own extension that only has one function and adds two numbers. This will take you to C land and -most likely- back. Run the same code in different versions of the language and see how they perform speed wise, memory wise. Run PHP on Apache, NGINX, and even try to run it on a Raspberry Pi, or any other UNIX like hardware like the Onion Omega. Learn Hack and all about the HHVM. Learn why and how Facebook was involved in it. This should take you on an interesting journey\u2026 not for the faint of heart, though! PS: I love the PHP language, but I love programming more than any language. The language is just a tool. I have a particular love for PHP because it was the first language I used to write a commercial app. (and I still do). But mastering PHP also means being proficient in many other languages. If you know only PHP, I don\u2019t think you will ever master it unless you get the perspective other languages can give you. ",
