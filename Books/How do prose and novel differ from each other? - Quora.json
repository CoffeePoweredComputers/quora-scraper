            "answer_text": "This is a simple one. A novel is (generally, and the wilder experiments only prove the rule) a long fictional narrative (long enough not to be called a \"novella,\" a \"little novel\") written in prose. The novel, in other words, is a literary genre. Prose is the presentation of written communication in unbroken sentences. It is a medium of presentation, usually contrasted with verse (which is the broken-lined medium in which poetry is presented). An instruction manual has little in common with most novels, but both are written in prose. I don't think there are any bona fide instruction manuals written in verse. (Even ancient georgic manifests a high level of artificiality and does not bother with agricultural rigor -- it uses the notion of working the earth to trope other human concerns. Other modes of didactic verse, such as Lucretius' exposition of Epicurean metaphysics in the dactylic hexameters of epic, use verse and poetic imagery to sweeten the rim of the cup, so the medicine will go down, to borrow Lucretius' own much-borrowed image.) Have novels been written in verse? Yes, in part or in whole. Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire is presented as a poem with commentary. Anne Carson is a genius at mingling the two media. But media they are. The medium of this answer has been prose. But now that I shall make a close, Let me first dispense with prose. ",

            "answer_text": "Prose is a form of language that possesses ordinary syntax and natural speech rather than rhythmic structure; in which regard, along with its measurement in sentences rather than lines, it differs from poetry. On the historical development of prose, Richard Graff notes that \"In the case of Ancient Greece recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development, an \"invention\" properly associated with the classical period\".Novel: a long fictional prose narrative. It was the form's close relation to real life that differentiated it from the chivalric romance; in most European languages the equivalent term is roman, indicating the proximity of the forms. In English, the term emerged from the Romance languages in the late fifteenth century, with the meaning of \"news\"; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction. Although there are many historical prototypes, so-called \"novels before the novel\", the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history \u2014 roughly during the eighteenth century.Initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically.
