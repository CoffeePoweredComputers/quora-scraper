I have 23 years experience in professional digital publishing and XML processing, and four entirely self-published books in both print and digital formats. I probably know more already about the production elements than she teaches in her course. If her claims on her website are accurate (\u201cpre-eminent six-figure Kindle self-publishing expert\u201d), she could probably teach me a thing or three about marketing, sales, and distribution, but I wouldn\u2019t sit through (or pay for) the rest of the course just to get to that part; I often find that courses like this are very vague about the sales & marketing part.
