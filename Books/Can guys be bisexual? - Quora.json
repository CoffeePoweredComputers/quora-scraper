            "answer_text": "This is a more sofisticated question than it seems. In fact, socially, bisexuality is only a problem for adult men - be it in our society, that doubts that, or in previous society where public bisexuality among men was a power trait that must be cultivated and showed, like in the Greek and Roman world. Why is that? Firstly, we must consider anatomy - which Freud famously, wisely, said is always the desteny when it comes to sexual practices. Female anatomy is ambisexual by definition: women have a diminished male organ, the clitoris, and a female organ - also, many substituives to the penis, like the brest. Men, instead, only counts on their penis. This leads to symbolic consequence: homosexuality for men is a menace of castration, or an hipercompensation of it if the guy is in the active, more male position, like the erastas in the relationship to the eromenos as stated above. For women, not only the menace of castration is not there neither in heterosexuality nor in homosexuality, as they do not have a penis to loose and in the phantasie this loss already happened, by female homosexuality is a way to deny the phalic order, as they make the penis worthless for sex, or to equal women to men in the sexual position. Also, there is a ontogenetic matter: the Oedipus Complex is heterosexual for the boy, and only latter it can become homosexualized by the eroticization of the rivalry with the father; as for the women, the first object of love is another women, the mother, and only later they get into an Oedipus complex that can not properly be called heterosexual as the father is already a substitution to the mother. This is not to say that bisexuality is normal for adult women - in both cases alegating bisexuality is a sympthon of a ill done choice of object, uncomplete and somewhat unconcluded. But for women, the bisexuality appears as a positive sympthon, so to speak: a suplement, a plus, in the anatomical capacity of desire and joy; for men, it usually appears as a justification or a negative sympthon in front of a menace of castration. Any way, bisexuality can not be taken by its face value, as it is a non-choice of object: it may be a neurotic sympthon (be it a obsessive doubt or a hysterical joy), a perverse unlying, or a metaphor to a delusion of emasculation in psychotics. It must be seen inside a psychic structure, beyond sexuation. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes if they are attracted to both men and women, then we are bi. I enjoy BOTH sexes. I have been with both and can be with either one again. The definition of bisexuality that I found on the internet and I agree with this definition. How do you define bisexuality? I just thought I'd ask how there are straight guys out there that can be straight if they are into performing fellatio? Then there are gay ones that won't perform it. I can see the latter making sense, but how can you call yourself straight if you will do anything whatsoever with your own gender? I define it as: if you are interested in either gender and won't turn either one down. I always thought that if you are willing to do anything at all with your own or opposite gender you must be bi. Imagine a scale from 0 to 100, with the 0 being homo and 100 being totally hetero. If you are 0, then you will not ever be interested at all with the opposite gender meaning that you will not ever touch them or even be curious about it. The same goes for the hetero people at the other end of the scale at 100. So if you are from, let's say, 1 to 99 then you are bi. If you have any interest in the other gender or even curious about it then you must not be gay. If you are interested in your own gender or curiosity, then you must not be straight. In conclusion, if you research this you will find that you are bi according to Freud in that we are all born innately bisexual then branch out to the homo or hetero side. I fully support that bi means BOTH sexes, men and women, TWO genders. If you are attracted to everyone, then you are PANsexual, NOT BI-sexual. Any questions? ",

When I started having sex with men, I found it both sexually satisfying and visually interesting. So, I believe that may be the fine line. Bisexual men find sex with women and men both sexually satisfying and visually fulfilling. ",
