All I would need to do is Leave my familyQuit my jobFind a secret cave where I wouldn\u2019t be botheredSleep maybe four hours a nightStop cooking, cleaning, and exercisingStop being concerned with my hygeineSo what would I gain from the experience? Well\u2026 I would not remember the content of many of the books because I could not give my brain the necessary down time it needs to move the information from the short-term to the long-term memory (To retain information, you need to practice distributed learning, basically taking breaks and regularly revisiting the material).A nice case of eyestrain and major headaches.A decline in my physical health due to lack of exercise and only eating quick processed foods.A decline in my mental health from all that time alone (and I am saying this as a major introvert).I am sure there are those who claim reading 60 books in a month wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but neuroscience says that our brains can only store and recall a limited amount of material in any one setting\u2014 I used to teach this material at a local university to international students who had came to the U.S. to pursue degrees, so I\u2019m not just making this up . In addition, you must revisit the material or your neural connections to the information might become too weak or be pruned. This is why cramming is the least effective way to study for long-term recall. I guess if I had a pile of simplistic, short books I could read 60 in a month, but I value quality over quantity in my reading materials. ",

            "answer_text": "It is. Elon Musk did this when he was younger. I tried over this past winter break. I wasn\u2019t able to do read two books in a day, even though I spent most of the day reading. It depends on the type of book you read, how it\u2019s written, etc. For instance, I was able to speed through Sebastian Junger\u2019s Tribe and War in about three days. However, it took me a while to get through a couple pages of James Keegan\u2019s History of Warfare. Something like 3 hours for 50 pages. I supplemented with audio lectures and other things when I got tired. I wasn\u2019t able to pull it off though I can imagine others being able to. I can imagine myself being able to with more practice. I really only did this for a couple of days - these days I started reading when I woke up and stopped when I went to bed. Anyway, go for it. It\u2019s a great habit to start. ",
