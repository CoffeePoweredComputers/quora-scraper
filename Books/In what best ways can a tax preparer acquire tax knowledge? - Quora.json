            "answer_text": "IRS offers continuing education (CE) information, so start there. If you join a reputable association, they will also offer CE opportunities.Work with or for someone who knows more than you do, and learn from them. I know H&R Block offers excellent education and training opportunities for its employees.Read tax guides and reference materials that pertain to the returns you are currently doing. Get really good at understanding every aspect of what you already do - know it inside and out. As you dig deeper, you will find new information that will help you get a better \u2018feel\u2019 for taxes. Learn the terminology, practice the vocabulary, and find the connections between all the moving parts. Be precise. There is weirdness to tax logic that you can tap into once you start seeing the patterns - the why of what it was trying to accomplish rather than just the how of getting it on the return.Do practice returns. Case studies give you the data and then the correct answer. Run the return and see if you can get the answer correct. Whatever you get wrong, go to those tax books and references and study up on that one section until you understand why you got it wrong. We do lots of case studies in our office, but I don\u2019t know a retail source. I suppose if you have access to old returns that you know were right, you could use those in a similar way. Just be sure to only do returns post-2018 so you are dealing with current tax law.",
