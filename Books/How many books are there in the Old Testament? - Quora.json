Catholic Bibles remained unchanged following the Reformation and so retained \u201cseven books\u201d that were \u201crejected principally\u201d by Martin Luther King. Its canon of Old Testament texts is somewhat larger than that in translations used by the Protestants, which are typically based exclusively on the shorter Hebrew and Aramaic Masoretic Text. On the other hand, its canon, which does not accept all the books that are included in the Septuagint, is shorter than that of some churches of Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, which recognize other books as sacred scripture. \u201cBOOKS IN THE CATHOLIC BIBLE\u201d OLD TESTAMENT = 46 BOOKS GenesisExodusLeviticusNumbersDeuteronomyJoshuaJudgesRuth1 Samuel2 Samuel1 Kings2 Kings1 Chronicles2 ChroniclesEzraNehemiahTobit**Judith**Esther1 Maccabees**2 Maccabees**JobPsalmsProverbsEcclesiastesSong of SongsWisdom**Sirach**IsaiahJeremiahLamentationsBaruch**EzekielDanielHoseaJoelAmosObadiahJonahMicahNahumHabakkukZephaniahHaggaiZechariahMalachi** Seven (7) books in the Catholic Bible that are not found in the Protestant Bible \u201cBOOKS IN THE PROTESTANT BIBLE\u201d OLD TESTAMENT = 39 BOOKS GenesisExodusLeviticusNumbersDeuteronomyJoshuaJudgesRuth1 Samuel2 Samuel1 Kings2 Kings1 Chronicles2 ChroniclesEzraNehemiahEstherJobPsalmsProverbsEcclesiastesSong of SongsIsaiahJeremiahLamentationsEzekielDanielHoseaJoelAmosObadiahJonahMicahNahumHabakkukZephaniahHaggaiZechariahMalachi",

            "answer_text": "Both Catholics and Protestants attest to the same 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament. While Catholics and Orthodox do have additional books and include them in the same binding as the 66 canonized sacred texts, knowledgable Catholics and Orthodox do not hold these additional books to be equal to the canonized Scriptures. But they do give them considerable weight in developing doctrine. Because they were never included in the Old Testament by the Jews nor were they included in the earliest canon, Protestants may read these books as commentary but take the content \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d and certainly do not hold to them as having any divine authority. The treatment of the content of these books, the acceptance of church tradition instead of Scripture only (the Protestant position), and the acceptance of a pope are probably the sources of the great division between Catholics and Protestants.
