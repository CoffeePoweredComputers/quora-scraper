            "answer_text": "Technically Ender Wiggin is no smarter than Orson Scott Card. Battle school is only full of genius children. Ender\u2019s family has a high potential, so permission for a \u2018third\u2019 was granted. But in a room full of geniuses, something more is needed. Even a genius can miss the point of a societal proble. Big Bang Theory illustrates this in each episode. Ender essentially had to learn to \u2018grok\u2019 his opponents. Stranger in a Strange Land describes \u2018grokking\u2019 as this : Grok means \"to understand,\" of course, but Dr. Mahmoud, who might be termed the leading Terran expert on Martians, explains that it also means, \"to drink\" and \"a hundred other English words, words which we think of as antithetical concepts. 'Grok' means all of these. It means 'fear,' it means 'love,' it means 'hate'\u2014proper hate, for by the Martian 'map' you cannot hate anything unless you grok it, understand it so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with you\u2014then you can hate it. By hating yourself. But this implies that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise. Then you can hate\u2014and (I think) Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human equivalent could only be called mild distaste. Ender understood his enemy enough to know how to beat them, but in that moment of understanding he also emphasized so much with them the conquest hurt him, badly. Peter had too little empathy as a child. Valentine had far too much. So like the three bears, Ender was \u2018just right\u2019. Ender has insight as to what was needed to bugger the Buggers, and it nearly broke him to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of smartness are you asking about? He probably looked quite smart in his uniform with all his medals and everything. He was a genius when it comes to his emotional smartness and militaristic tactics. I doubt he was as street smart as Bean though considering he never lived on the streets. In the books, Bean is smarter than Ender when it came to gathering information or inferring from said information but Ender beat him by leagues when it came to Emotional IQ and thinking like the enemy. I wouldn\u2019t think Ender by himself or Bean by himself could\u2019ve won the war, each one of Ender\u2019s jeesh had their own part to play when it came to winning their battles and the war. ",
