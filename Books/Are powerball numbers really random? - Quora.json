            "answer_text": "Around 70 to 80 percent of Powerball players use Quick Pick tickets, and the same percentage of winning entries are Quick Picks. This shows that regardless of whether players choose to select their own numbers or not, the odds of winning remain the same. Accordingly, rhe Power Ball lottery appears to be random. ",

            "answer_text": "In the book Quantum Mechanics by Leonard I. Schiff there is a question at the end asking: A ping pong ball is dropped from a height equal to ten times its radius onto a second sphere of the same radius. The bouncing of the ping pong ball on this second sphere is perfectly elastic. Also imagine this is done in some ideal environment \u2013 no air, no earth rotation, nothing that can spoil the conditions for you. You hit the second sphere dead on, the ping pong recoils up to its original height, then again bounces, and then again, ... What limit does the uncertainty principle place on the number of bounces that might occur? The answer is that the ball can bounce a maximum of 99 times as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle comes into effect. So, yes, it is truly random, right to the quantum level. https://tbp.berkeley.edu/exams/3489/download/ ",

            "answer_text": "No. Ultimately there is a deterministic process which determines the numbers. No, I\u2019m not talking about a strategy which can actually be developed for gambling. You won\u2019t know that process and that\u2019s what makes it pseudo random. \u201cRandomness\u201d in gambling is synonymous with players\u2019 uncertainty of the outcome, not of the process itself. Nothing, not even quantum mechanics, is really random. Uncertainty is always in the mind, not the territory itself. ",
