            "answer_text": "My first \u201creal\u201d computer was an Apple IIe. The IIe itself was silent, but it came with a monitor stand that sat astride the computer. On the left side it had a cooling fan, and that was loud.  It looked identical to this fan. It probably was the same model and everything! (image credit) It sounded like it some shot bearings or some such, and it was just\u2026 well, you could tell when it was turned on. I shared an office with my mom and dad, but they never complained. After it was on for a few minutes, you could somewhat ignore it, but it was always there. I could\u2019ve gotten rid of it, but it acted as a power hub and surge protector as well. The IIe and the monitor were both plugged into it. I could just hit one switch and turn them both on, which I loved. I assume I could\u2019ve just purchased another one, but I bought the computer second-hand and had no idea where to get another one (this was way before Amazon). I lived in Silicon Valley, but even so, computer stores were few and far between back in the day. And they didn\u2019t carry everything. This fan was a bit of a specialty item; I never saw another Apple II with one. My next real computer was a Commodore 64 (I still had the IIe).  Just like this, but I kept my disk drive on the right (image credit) I got the disk drive for it almost immediately, but that thing was a disaster. It was light years faster than cassette, but the thing would fail, often. I felt it was because it was overheating, because it was always really warm to the touch. So I pointed a small fan down on it to try to keep it cool. That generated noise. It wasn\u2019t too bad; it wasn\u2019t nearly as loud as the Apple II\u2019s fan. My next computer was the Amiga 1000. I don\u2019t remember if it had a fan or not, but if it did, it was whisper quiet. Since then, all of my computers (all PCs) have been different. Some are loud, some are quiet. My main computer, a big desktop computer, has several fans. They\u2019re very audible, but not in an annoying manner. I can always hear them, but they\u2019re just white noise that\u2019s easy to ignore. ",

            "answer_text": "My first computer was custom-built by my father. It had pretty much one fan setting: ON. It was about as noisy as a desk fan. My first laptop was a crap HP laptop that also had pretty much one fan setting: ON. It was an audible hiss, but not distracting. My first decent computer was a Microsoft Surface 3. It was fanless. My first decent laptop was a Surface Laptop. The fan was off most of the time, and occasionally it would turn on to a very subtle hiss that you could only hear if the room was completely silent and you put your ear right next to the ventilation grille. During heavy tasks, the maximum fan speed was quite audible, but it still wasn\u2019t loud. ",
