            "answer_text": "There is no specific duration of how long masturbation should last From my personal experience, I masturbate from 10 min to an hour . Actually I was one of the people who experienced premature ejaculation. But one thing changed everything for me to go from a premature ejaculator to learning Male multiple orgasm that is male orgasms without Ejaculating. So I started practicing those techniques around 3 months ago and learned it within a month of practice when I started . I mastered edging and squeezing method I started to last longer naturally . My orgasms started getting incredible intense basically full body orgasms. My orgasms started lasting over a minute and I used to chain it with multiple orgasms which literally shakes the whole body with pleasure. This made me last longer actually far longer and thus I learned male multiple orgasms. Every man is able to do this and separated orgasm from ejaculation. So in short there is no limited duration of masturbation ",

            "answer_text": "It can range for everyone and nothing is \u201cnormal\u201d about it. Don\u2019t think about the time but enjoying it. If you are wanting to take care of it quickly, you will. If you want a sensual and deep experience with it, you will as well. From my own personal experience, I can take care of one in a couple of minutes if just trying to get rid of the feeling. But if I want it to be powerful and potent, relaxing in a sense maybe before bed, then it isn\u2019t uncommon for multiple times or just maybe one long 30 minute session making your whole body feel good. Ultimately, just enjoy. ",
