            "answer_text": "When Jigoro Kano founded Judo in the 1880s it was based on the throwing techniques of Kito-Ryu Jujutsu and the choking and pinning moves of Tenjin Shinyo-ryu. He was an educator, and wanted to introduce martial arts to the Japanese educational system. He had three main goals for Judo: He wanted it to be safe for students to practice. With that goal in mind he removed from his Judo any techniques which were gratuitously dangerous, such as kicks, strikes, small-joint manipulations, and eye gouges.He wanted Judo to be scientific by nature, so he removed any techniques which gave any advantage based on strength. For that reason, Judo throwing techniques became the best in the world, and were considered \u201cequalizers,\u201d giving new fighting power to smaller and weaker practitioners. Judo became \u201cthe style to learn\u201d if you wanted to round out your combatives trainingHe wanted Judo to build good character in its practitioners. To that end Judo taught values such as \u201cJita-Kyoei \u2013 Mutual Benefit\u201d and \u201cSeiryoku-Zenyo \u2013 Maximum efficiency with minimum effort\u201d.Kano\u2019s Judo was not originally practiced competitively. Instead, judoka practiced with little relative force, focusing on technique more than winning. Kano was joined by a number of martial masters representing a range of styles from Sumo, Kendo, various Jujutsu schools, and, later, Aikido. Those men often remained true to their original styles but cross trained in the scientific Judo methods, however some like Kyozo Mifune joined Kano\u2019s Judo ranks and became invaluable teachers and missionaries spreading the word about the new martial art. Fighters from other styles cross training with Kano could use their Judo skills to elevate their primary martial styles, while Judo would remain a sport. Watch the attached video of Kyozo Mifune working out with high ranked younger students. Mifune\u2019s steps and movements are light, almost like dancing. His opponents can easily lift him up, but are unable to turn him over for a throw\u2026 but his throws are sudden and effortless.  This was the way of pre-war Judo. After WW II ended, foreign troops occupying Japan began learning Judo, and when they returned home they continued to practice and teach. Western wrestling traditions were introduced into Judo, and the sport became less technical and more physical. Watch Shohei Ono in the video below. Ono is part of the \u201cNew Breed\u201d of postwar judoka. Note the power moves. While Ono\u2019s techniques are still technically excellent, his increased use of power is clearly visible.  As Jigoro Kano raised the technical quality of Judo to new heights, the new competitive nature of practice threatens to turn Judo into Wrestling. And the additional downward pressure of Olympic inclusion may make that change permanent. If that happens, it will be a shame. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the pre-WW2 Judo was what is called \u201csanitized\u201d. Like karate, many lethal and dangerous techniques were removed and the forms tweaked a bit in order to keep them from the \u201cround-eyes\u201d who sought to learn it. The early masters wanted something to teach to schoolchildren safely, as well, so the kids didn\u2019t kill each other. J. Kano invented a sport based upon his philosophy, as others did. The philosophy of Aikido, for example, was the Way of Peace. Aikido was based on being in harmony, not conflict, with others. The art was a physical and living demonstration of how this is done. Later, us modern people wanted something more, and wanted to go to the \u201cnext level\u201d, so older and more original techniques were revived, so since the \u201860\u2019s and \u201870\u2019s we have self defense and martial art courses that \u201cbring back the ancient deadly techniques\u201d of the past. I know; I grew up in the \u201860\u2019s and \u201870\u2019s and had a number of those books. For example, Destructive Self Defense by Joe Weider, and The World\u2019s Deadliest Fighting Techniques by \u201cCount Dante\u201d that I am still kicking myself in the butt for getting rid of or losing long ago, because they are so difficult to obtain now.
