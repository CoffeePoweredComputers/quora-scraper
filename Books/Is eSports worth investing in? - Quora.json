            "answer_text": "Yes, without a doubt. Here\u2019s a dirty copy/paste of some parts of the presentation I prepared for Wired Consulting but never got to give. It was more focused on eSports betting, but you\u2019ll get the idea. If you use this to secure investment and/or invest, hire me as a consultant. Otherwise I\u2019ll have to hunt, find, and kill you =D. \u2014 Why investing in esports is a safe bet Austerity: There will be another major financial crash before 2020. Ratings companies like S&P have already factored this contraction and the subsequent taxpayer bailout into their ratings projections. What\u2019s more, many economic conditions are very similar to the conditions leading up to the 1929 Great Depression.Why is this of any interest? Well, during the Great Depression consumer spending on just about everything decreased, but spending on movies SKYROCKETED. When times are hard, people want to escape reality. This is accomplished by increased spending on leisure activities. eSports, without a doubt, is the number one leisure activity of the 21st century.Now, in addition to this, also regard the changing work/leisure balance: Better technology leads to increased productivity and/or technological unemployment: both mean more leisure time.Game Boy Generation: During the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, many, but not all youths grew up with video games. Already, a huge subculture already emerged. eSports showed up to the scene very early on, and had a relatively big first decade in spite of not being mainstream at all.iPad Generation: Post the year 2000, most youths grew up not knowing a world without personal electronics or the internet: these people are the real digital natives. As a result, gaming as a culture and a sport are rapidly going mainstream. Investments coming in from everywhere, events are drawing multi million dollar viewership numbers, live viewing arenas are selling out instantly, esports athletes are now stars and very much open to endorsement deals. Now remember this is just the beginning, this is just the first generation growing up native to digital games and sports. The real growth is still in front of us.Virtual Reality:The next step up is virtual reality. In the near future VR bloodsport will become possible. Imagine MMA fighters in virtual arenas, battling each other and computer generated enemies to the death. Roman colloseum fights reimagined. Except now you can watch from any perspective you like (including first person), from any location you like - in complete immersion. Imagine the viewership and betting on that.Now remember that looming economic crash we spoke about, and consider:+ Increased spending on leisure activities during times of austerity+ Bread and circusesMarket:Refer to these and compare YOY growth: SuperData Research\u2019s eSports market brief 2015SuperData Research\u2019s eSports market brief 2016Audience: ~90% men aged 15-24, with regiments of older fans coming back due to esports entering a golden age: fans up to 35 years old.Generally well-educated with disposable income: esports fans generally spend around 200$ a month.> Your target audience is a marketeer\u2019s wet dream. Super concentrated, dedicated, and with money to blow. Marketing:Two words: Community engagement (aka \u201ccontent marketing\u201d). The esports community is very invested and passionate community, that is extremly kind to those that treat it well. What\u2019s more, a lot of scalable infrastructure through which you can economically engage with a global audience is already in place: Streaming websites such as Youtube Gaming, Twitch TV, Hitbox TV, ..Encyclopedias with a lot of data available for freeAPI's & support by the game studiosMany different regular tournaments for different games.",

            "answer_text": "This is a very confusing question: (1) \u201cIs eSports worth investing in?\u201d \u201cInvesting\u201d, I presume the OP means as a venture capitalist/angel investor. (2) \u201cthe international Dota 2 championship of 2015 amassed a total prize pool of $18,429,613. There was a 16 year old Pakistani Dota 2 players who won $1.2 million, his parents said they have never seen so much money in their entire life.\u201d This tells us about the magnitude of the event, one can make rough estimates (i.e. guesses) of what could it be the market and what could be the future of eSports. OP focus on the stunning fact that one kid made $1.2M so, one could interpret this question as \u201cIs esports worth investing your time to be a pro gamer?\u201d. (3) \u201cWhat are the entrepreneurial opportunities in eSports?\u201d Again, 3rd figure, after the investor and the gamer, we have the entrepreneur.   I consider myself an (ex)pro-gamer (poker). I\u2019ve played a considerable amount of hours since I\u2019m legally able to do so in my country, so, since I\u2019m 18, I should have played more than 2.5k hours per year, I\u2019m 23 now. I could be easily in the world top 0.05% of players with the most hands played. So, I know what does it takes to be *always* on top of your game, I know the grind, the struggle and I also know that in Dota or LOL or CS or whatever, to be part of the top 0.01% (those who realistically make the big bucks) are required waaaay more skills than to be top0.01% in poker. So, Is it feasible to start from 0, and try to become the hero, in games where the big payout is skewed towards the top of the top, where Korean guys grind more than 10 hours a day, since years and years, and you are starting today? not really. It\u2019s an absurd waste of your time if you think you are going to make money by playing those games and you start from 0. If you are an already experienced player and you are already way above the average of the players, you may try to see if increasing your grinding/training you are able to fill this huge gap that exists between you and the top, between those who can make a living through esports and those who never will. So, as for the point (2), no, becoming a pro-gramer from scratch, is not profitable. You should find a new game, a new niche, and see the potentiality of the game, it has to become really addictive, at first a few people must love it, and then, going viral, it could take some traction and become the new Dota, and you, being one of the \u201cearly adopters\u201d should have some sort of edge, presumably. The same edge Koreans have on you. This is also the path to make the big bucks in entrepreneurship: see the future before it happensbe ahead of timesearch for high potentiality of growthfew people that love the product is > a lot of people that just like the productbecause those who love make the product sell way more laterSo, realistically, yes, there are opportunities in entrepreneurship because esports is the evolution of sports. It is the future and a lot more people will start playing, there will be a steady growth and you know what wall street and investors love? Revenue growth (or potential revenue growth) (I love free cash flow and I think they are crazy, but that\u2019s a different topic that I won\u2019t discuss here :P). Today\u2019s kids players will be tomorrow\u2019s adults, so you are creating today the base of your future customers. THIS. IS. HUGE. What are the channels to monetize, i.e. how could an entrepreneur make money off this trend? Create new leagues, tournaments and competitions: you take a small margin via the fee for the enrollment to the tournament. logistical and sales skills required. e.g. : Create and develope a new game and selling it to household name (or figuring out the way to make money off that: here you need coding and programming skillsSelling merchandising related to the game or competition, here, you need to own the rights, so it\u2019s not simple\u2026The show man: the one that has a Twitch/youtube ( Twitch Statistics by Socialblade ) account and makes funny videos while playing, he isn\u2019t required to be the best player, but he must be a top entertainer. This is also a profession and I\u2019d see this figure more similar to an entrepreneur than to a pro-gamer, because you are making money via a collateral activity of the game -> streaming yourself.Coaching: again, not a pro-gamer, because if you were so good, you wouldn\u2019t teach other people what you do, but it\u2019s a way of monetizing.Make a news site or original content site, related to esports or related to just one game.Certainly there are others ways to monetize, but I currently am not able to generate other ideas. Of course it depends on the success of the entrepreneurial activity, e.g. you could coach 1 on 1, like you could write a book teaching techniques, you could make a video-course, or you can create a school and get paid by the affiliated. You could make a crappy game for ios, or you can make the new diablo 4, clearly to be at the top of the spectrum, you need to be in the top of the tops of entrepreneurs with a technical/computer science background, while your skill may not need to be so astonishing if you want to make a simple game with the potentiality to be an esport. Venture capital, i.e. investing money in eSports: This, may be the most difficult task, perhaps even more than being a player, because you need a large amount of money to invest in company that make business through esports. And if you had the budget and capacity to invest in those, you wouldn\u2019t ask on Quora how to do it. But, this may change in the near future and small investors will be able to invest in startups and private companies You Too Can Now Invest in Startups! What Could Go Wrong? Let\u2019s face it, times are changing, any kids can dream to win the Dota 2 championship, very few players in the world will actually have a shot at winning, and only if you are among them, you are not guaranteed to become a millionaire. Put it in prospective, how many hours did you train yourself to arrive at that moment? 10 hours a day, every day, per at least 3 years, you made 1M, so it\u2019s like making 1k$/h, *only if you win*. What is the opportunity cost of being a pro-gamer if you don\u2019t make it? what is the future of your career at a traditional job if you don\u2019t make it? It was a long answer, I hope you enjoyed the brief digressions on venture capitalists, entreprenuers and gamers. Feel free to make any corrections and sorry about my poor grammar\u2026 ",
