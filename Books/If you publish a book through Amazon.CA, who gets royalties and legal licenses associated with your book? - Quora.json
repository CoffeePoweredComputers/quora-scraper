            "answer_text": "To publish anywhere on Amazon, you need a KDP account. Royalties and notifications get sent to the KDP account holder who uploaded the book. If it\u2019s your account, you get the royalties paid how you specified them to be. Usually into your bank account. If the book was uploaded by a publisher, they get the royalties, and are responsible for paying you your share. They also get the notifications. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u2018legal licenses\u2019? If you published as an Indie, you still own ALL rights. If you were published, then the rights the publisher has are in your contract.
