            "answer_text": "As mentioned elsewhere, the SCP Foundation and its related universe are fictional and while there might be some elements inspired in real life, the majority of the objects (technically they can be other things than just objects, including phenomena, ideas, concepts, etc.) known colloquially as \u201cSCPs\u201d are purely fictional. SCP-096 is one such object. If your question is in-universe, then the general answer would be \u201cyes\u201d, but there is no canon so there might be some tales or even \u201ccanons\u201d (collections of articles which follow internal consistency) where that particular creature is not real. I cannot think of any of them that pinpoints SCP-096 specifically as fictional (there\u2019s a few which greater portions of the universe are considered to be fabrications, but that\u2019s another scale).

            "answer_text": "Well, we all do know he is a plague doctor and is a monster. As some of you know SCP's aren't real, but what about SCP-096 since he's a doctor? Nobody really knows if he's real or not because he might be a human under the mask. But according to me I would think he'd would be real but if he is, I'm sure he's pretty far. There is actually a real place of Secure. Contain. Protect. I think it's somewhere in a large feikd though but it would be under the ground a little lol. That's my opinion though but I doubt the answer is yes. ",
