            "answer_text": "It ends with Bella becoming pregnant with Edward\u2019s kid. The Volturi want to kill it, but they end up not doing so. Bella becomes a vampire because she was about to die, and Jacob imprints on the baby (Renesmee) which means he will now do anything to protect Renesmee if she is in danger. When she grows up, he will fall in love with her and then marry her. That is what is shown in Alice\u2019s vision. It\u2019s a little messed up in some places, speaking as a Potterhead with a huge distaste for Twilight, but I read the books and watched the movies, so I can at least have a right to say something. Some Twihards pay no regard to which book was published first and go right on to flame Potter when they don\u2019t even know how to spell \u2018Sirius\u2019, let alone know what Sirius is (a star in Canis Major, earth\u2019s brightest star). Alright, I\u2019m ranting. But that\u2019s how Twilight ends. It\u2019s a happy ending in the epilogue I guess\u2026 if you like that stuff ",

            "answer_text": "As a Potterhead and ex-Twihard, it ends very neatly in a happily ever after bubble where all the main characters live forever with their life partners. Seriously though. That battle in Breaking Dawn part 2? Non-existent in the books. They spend, like, twenty pages negotiating and talking and then the Volturi let Renesmee live and go back to their hovel in Rome. Even lovesick puppy Jacob who luuuurves Bella imprinted on her daughter, who conveniently for Jacob, doesn\u2019t smell vampirish enough to turn him off. And did I mention that the gerascophobe never ages? Literally, Bella, that 18th birthday temper tantrum and meltdown and obsessive search for wrinkles was for nothing. And Bella and Edward lived happily ever after with Renesmee in the woods. ",
