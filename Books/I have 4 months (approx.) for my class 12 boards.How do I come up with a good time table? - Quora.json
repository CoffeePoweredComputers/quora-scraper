            "answer_text": "Rediff (.com) has got some interesting and valid suggestions for people who are studying for examinations. Study for the last subject (exam timetable) first and the first subject last. Identify your weaker subjects and allot them more time. Have sufficient sleep (7 to 8 hours), food and be relaxed. Try to solve previous question papers and time yourself when doing so. Group study at least twice a week - so that you can inter-relate on solving questions. You can use this sessions for Q & A workouts on the tougher subjects. Concentrate on what you are capable of and do not worry about what others are doing. Get involved with your parents more and try to have at least one meal together, every day. Do not bother about subjects you have already answered and - do not worry about the results; even before writing the examinations. Also interact with your teachers, if you have the time. Try not to be distracted and do concentrate on your required work. Prepare to your capacity. Have time for about 20 minutes of walking and / or exercise, every day. Well, best of luck ! ",
