            "answer_text": "While it depends if you want to write fiction or non-fiction, a majority of advice would say to write about what you know. This is because you\u2019re more likely to be able to write it well, whereas if you have no information about medicine or science fiction, then you might fall short with the knowledge or tropes that readers are trying to get to. If you want to write non-fiction I would start out by making a list of what you\u2019ve learned over the years. This could be things you studied in school or in secondary education, or even on your own. I know quite a bit of information about the American mafia simply because after reading The Godfather series I became interested in it. I did loads of research and can now comfortably say that I know more than your average joe. Once you find a topic that you know quite a bit about and would feel comfortable writing, do some research on Amazon for books with a similar topic. See what they\u2019re doing and talking about and where you can provide either an alternative view or a new idea. If you want to write fiction I believe that writing about what you know is trite advice not worth listening to. If we all did that, no one would be writing about space travel because so few of us have experienced. Yet space travel is a hot niche in fiction. If you know what genre (romance, horror, thriller, etc.) you want to write, your next bet is to do research into how it breaks down from there. Maybe you want to write a billionaire romance book about a kinky CEO who finds love in a brunette. 50 Shades of Gray may have already been published, but books very similar to this premise still top the charts of romance. You\u2019ll want to do your research and see what is selling and if you can write to the market that\u2019s buying. This is your best bet in creating a book that will sell in oversaturated genres such as romance. I hope some of this information helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Does it sound a simple question, Victor? It really isn\u2019t. I believe writers who \u201cchoose\u201d subjects for future books are rare; true rarities, in fact. Perhaps they don\u2019t exist at all. In my fairly limited experience, I find the subjects push themselves forward at times that suit themselves. They can be quite pushy if it\u2019s a time for a cash transfusion. Then, choosing becomes, not a notion, but a necessity. Nowadays, happily for me, I\u2019m past that point. When an idea comes knocking, I may let it in if I like its face or tone of voice. Then show it into what happens to be the warmest room in the house, make a pot of tea, perhaps, and listen. (All of this is entirely figurative, you\u2019ll appreciate.) Some ideas stay a long time, some go for the trigger right away. Then it comes to dealing. Will it require a lot of fact finding? Or is the task wholly creative? If creative, how well are the creative juices flowing? Has it doorstepped me at a propitious time? Shall we dance? Is it a foxtrot or an Argentinian tango? If you reach this stage, the idea has already chosen you. Now you can - gingerly - take to the floor and see if you can somehow avoid stepping on each other\u2019s feet or kicking one another\u2019s ankles. If so, you could have a book. It\u2019s a lovely feeling when it happens. Sometimes it\u2019s a relief when it doesn\u2019t. Ideas are ten a penny but books don\u2019t write themselves. Don\u2019t sell themselves either. You may sometimes wish you\u2019d never opened the door or put the kettle on! But if you don\u2019t\u2026 There\u2019s a case to be made, by the way, for getting a few short stories into print first. It\u2019s called cutting your teeth. If you\u2019re moderately lucky, it even pays. ",
