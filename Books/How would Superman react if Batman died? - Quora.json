            "answer_text": "Obviously Superman would be devasted at the loss of his old pal Batman. Or wait,, would he really? Lets exam this for a moment. Superman is the ultimate superhero! He can see through virtually anything- with the exception of lead of course! He's able to use his pin point precision laser beam eyes to blow stuff up! And his ultimate talent-flying! Why Superman doesn't even require a lot of time to change into his manly leotards. He doesn't even need to stop and take a breather after rotating the earth from it's opposite rotation! He doesn't rely on oxygen like Batman does! Batman relies heavily on gadgets to save the save the day! He's unstoppable as long as he's not experiencing technical difficulties or no one's tampered with his high tech toys. And of course lots and lots of triple \u201cA\u201d batteries! He's the flashier \u201ccooler\u201d superhero that all the young wanna-be superhero's look up to! I'm thinking that since Superman's such a gentleman he'd never admit this out loud to anyone(maybe just Lois) but he'd not be overly upset to discover poor Batman's demise! He then would be the alpha superhero male. He's also immortal and needs to consider his future where Batman's concerned. He could once again hog the limelight and all Batman's former worshippers would have no choice but to make the switch. Plus-I'm thinking Superman wouldn't mind getting his hands on some of those gadgets either. It would be such ashame to let them go to waste! I'm sure Superman would publically grieve the lost of such a dear companion but inwardly he'd feel like the vice president after the current President dies. And since he's immortal, he knows one day day he'll get his secret wish! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not too familiar with these DC fellas, but I'm sure if Batman died, Superman wouldn't give a damn. He'd probably be happy   Considering Batman kills normal thugs all the time, while Superman only kills Kryptonians. He'd probably infrared vision the body to make sure he's really dead and not Romeo & Juliet-ing everybody. Superman would probably pretend to be sad: \u201cwhy? WHY, WAYNE? You were my pal! You knew my secret and I knew yours! We were on the same team! WHY?!?!\u201d. But in his mind he'll be like: \u201cGreat! That gloomy bastard finally bit the big one! Fuck you, Bruce! You sorry, good for nothing, soft-skinned pervert! At least now, acrobatic little boys are safe again! I hope you get stuck in the time stream or speed force or something\u2026 sick, bat pajamas wearing, no powers having, melancholic stick in the mud! I'll show you: I'm gonna fuck Catwoman and Damien's mom. Better yet, I'm gonna reverse the Earth's rotation, go back in time and fuck your mom. When you're born, I'm gonna beat you everyday! I honestly and thoroughly hate your bleeding guts! I\u2019m Glad You\u2019re Dead! YES!\u201d  Later on that night, after the funeral, Supes might dig up the coffin and throw it into the sun for good measure  Who really knows? I certainly don't! ",
