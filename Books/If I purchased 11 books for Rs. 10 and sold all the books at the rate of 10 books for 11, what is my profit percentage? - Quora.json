            "answer_text": "In solving this type of problems of Profit and loss , you can suppose any number of books which are purchased and sold at different rates . You can follow algebraic method by taking total number of books as x . In this case it is better to take LCM of 11 ( books the condition mentioned as per the purchase ) and 10 ( books as the condition mentioned as per the sale ) . Clearly , the LCM of 10 and 11 comes 110 . ( See yourself how the calculations become dam easy .) . Let the total number of books purchased be 110 Cost Price of 11 books is 10 rupees Cost Price of 1 book will be 10 / 11 rupees Cost Price of 110 books will be 10 / 11 \u00d7 110 = 100 rupees Sale Price of 10 books is 11 rupees Sale Price of 1 book will be 11 / 10 Sale Price of 110 books will be 11 / 10 \u00d7 110 = 121 rupees As Sale Price is greater than Cost Price there will be profit which is equal to 121 - 100 = 21 rupees . As this profit is on the cost price of 100 rupees , the profit will be 21 percent . So the required answer : the profit in the whole deal is 21 % . Algebraic Method :- Let the total number of books purchased or sold be x Cost Price of 1 book is 10 / 11 rupees Cost Price of x number of books will be 10 / 11 \u00d7 x or 10x / 11 rupees Similarly , Sale Price of x number of books will be 11x / 10 rupees Profit = 11x / 10 - 10x / 11 = ( 121 x - 100x ) / 121 or 21x / 110 Profit Percent ( formula ) = Profit / Cost Price \u00d7 100 Profit Percent = 21x / 110 \u00f7 Cost Price \u00d7 100 Or Profit Percent : 21x / 110 \u00f7 10x / 11 \u00d7 100 Or 21x / 110 \u00d7 11 / 10x \u00d7 100 = 21 Again the required answer : profit 21 % .
