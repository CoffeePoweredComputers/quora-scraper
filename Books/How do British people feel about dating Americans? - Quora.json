            "answer_text": "Please mind the negativity in this, I\u2019m an American woman married to a British man, we often had discussions on what makes our relationship work\u2026 I personally think American men and British women is a more difficult match. I find that the UK is much more accommodating to women, women in the UK expect more (there is nothing wrong with this). The arrogant, misogynistic attitude, lack of empathy, the childish attitudes, not so great sense of style and the clueless lost puppy look when they openly insult you to your face would be a turn off for most British women.This won't fly especially to the element of materialistic women in the UK that tend to be a bit over-indulged. This is by no means all American men and British women, I\u2019m talking about the absolute worst of the two groups\u2026 I would say to the contrary of British women, most American men exhibit some trace elements of those negative characteristics. American women and British men tend to get along better. American women (at least us working-class ones) are a bit hands-on, we have pretty low expectations, but we aren't anything spectacular, we do not have the fashion sense of British women but most British men see past that. American men tend to leave much to be desired, so average Joe British man, nothing spectacular. is like a dream come true to an American woman.I would say our wealthier female counterparts may not be a good match as they are far too picky, and want to micromanage their significant other. which a British man wouldn't want to deal with. Lastly for British men, I\u2019m far too generous to this group, they tend to be tough, but still want to be loved, they will find themselves in precarious love situations as helpless romantics, so when they meet an American woman who expects very little they often make a great pair\u2026 meanwhile, the British man is ticking all our boxes for just being themselves. In all our shortcomings tend to be the driving match between American woman/British man pairs. As far as the other way around, I don't know what the attraction is. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a British man who has dated an American girl. Funnily enough, I looked her up on Facebook a few days ago and she is now married with a baby. It was interesting to compare her to British and European girls. She was great by the way \u2013 funny, sweet and intelligent. I also had an American female friend at college (she was a New Yorker). Things I noticed about both of them compared to British girls: They were less cynical/ more optimisticThey were more enthusiastic, upbeat and happyLess self-conscious/ self-awareLess inhibited/restrained in their day to day livesA bit of a cliche, but they definitely had a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitudeLess ironic and subtle \u2013 more literal-mindedBoth incredibly gutsy/ less vulnerable (though that could have just been them \u2013 after all, both had moved to the UK on their own)I have a little theory that British guys and American women are weirdly compatible. I don\u2019t know what it is. I know several British guys who are very happily married to American women. The ex I looked up on Facebook is also married to a British guy and looks very happy \u2013 I hope she is anyway, she was lovely. I wonder how American guys view British women? ",
