            "answer_text": "First off\u2026 you need to assume there are zero open doors available to you when it comes to \u201ctraditional publishing.\u201d Traditional publishing is, has, and always will be more of a cult than a business model. Unless you have a great agent, are already known or famous, have an uncle at a top-tier publisher, or made a ton of sales through self-publishing - those doors are closed, gone, non-existent. The good news is, you can attract the attention of one of them with a self-published book. I know, because I did. Two of my books became best-sellers on Amazon, and I had 2 major publishing houses reach out to me. The first finally offered a sign-on deal of $145,000 dollars - the second, we didn't make it that far. Why? Because both of them wanted to: Rewrite my books to fit them within the publishing company's format.Sign contracts relieving me of any ownership rights of my intellectual property.That second one was the kicker\u2026 Intellectual property is, well, ANYTHING. Businesses, app ideas, websites, books, drawings, poems saved in a draft folder\u2026. Anything. In exchange for $145,000 and royalties, the language in their contract basically stated I would be giving up my rights to anything that came from my mind, for the rest of my life. So, I stayed self-published. And eventually started my own publishing company. Get the idea out of your head that any publisher will care about you. Get the idea out of your head that you will ever sell a single copy of your book. If you love to write, write your book and publish it on your own. If you are writing to get paid, don't waste yours or anyone else's time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but I need to clarify two different scenarios of your question. Being a self-published author does not preclude you from being published by traditional publishers. In fact, it can actually help because publishers know that having been through the process, you understand what it takes to publish and market a book. Regardless of how your previous books were published, a publisher will look to your previous sales record to determine your likelihood for new sales because publishers want to know a book has a strong chance of recouping the publishing costs. The other side of this question would be asking if a publisher will publish a book previously self-published by the author. This is possible, however not likely unless the book has great sales records. Its not in a publishers interest to republish a book unless it did well and the books proven sales record makes it worth it to them. In either of these cases, don\u2019t kid yourself that a publisher wouldn\u2019t know your sales history for your previously published books regardless of whether they were self-published or not because they have access to behind the scenes sales data linked to a book\u2019s metadata. If you have previously published books with poor sales histories, that tells a publisher that either the author isn\u2019t able to market themselves and their books or their writing quality is lacking or both.
