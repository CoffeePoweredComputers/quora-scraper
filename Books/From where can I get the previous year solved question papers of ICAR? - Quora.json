Moreover, for most of the examinations you can find the question papers in the commercially published question banks. Most of the objective / MCQ books also provide old questions papers as an annexurs. In some cases, you can get question papers from the students / seniors studying in institutions like IARI, NDRI, IVRI, CIFE, TNAU etc. Best luck. ",
