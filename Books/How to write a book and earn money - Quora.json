            "answer_text": "I would suggest you to start writing on topics that interests you, because if write what you love, the question of how do I write does not arise. If you have the fear of not making sense with your writing or what you have written may mean something else. Fret not! A self publishing house like Betagram is thee to help. They are a self publishing house that work towards guiding and support new writers or amateur writers taking their step in the writing industry. They have a set dedicated team working on first time content, and helping writers understand the writing industry. Talking about earning money, if your content is out of the box and makes sense (which we will look into) then money wouldn't matter. It is more about establishing a loyal reading audience than looking at money. If you get the first criteria right the latter will follow. Hope the answer helped. Have a Great Day! ",
