            "answer_text": "Thanks for requesting my answer. I\u2019d say that we see instances of each. I see various forms of this question being asked primarily about Muslims, and so I\u2019ll use extremists and terrorists who are Muslim as my primary examples. In terms of terrorist attacks in non-Muslim countries such as the United States and European nations, those are primarily political. However, extremist interpretations of religion, and religious duty, etc. are used for their motivating power - to recruit terrorists and to get them to be willing to kill themselves in order to conduct an attack. Many people express that these attacks are somehow \u201creally religious\u201d - but the details don\u2019t make sense when analyzed from that angle. The only way that all the details make sense is when suicide attacks by extremist Muslims are viewed through the lens of terrorism as a classic asymmetrical warfare tactic, by a weaker opponent against a vastly stronger power. Simply put, the terrorists are seeking to create disproportionate influence by killing a relatively small number of people in a way that will be reported widely, thus terrorizing many, many more people. Why do they want to terrorize many people? Because their strategy is based on the belief that citizens in democracies can influence their governments, because they elect their own leaders. Therefore, the terrorists believe that dramatic terrorist attacks will motivate citizens in democracies to force their leaders to stop attacking and invading Muslim majority nations, stop manipulating governments of Muslim-majority countries (i.e. putting and keeping dictators in power), and stop funding oppression, occupation, abuse and killing of Muslims via foreign aid to countries that do these things. The Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST) has an excellent set of details on all this. They also maintain a database of every suicide attack in the world, starting from 1975. Here\u2019s a link to an introduction video about CPOST, and what their research has discovered. As the very beginning of the video is the so-called \u201cmartyr video\u201d of Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the horrific 7/7 attacks in the U.K. in 2005. As you watch the video, notice how many times he mentions religion. That may go a long way toward answering your question. The rest of the video features an excellent overview on the nature of suicide attacks in the West, given by Robert Pape, the director of CPOST. Also, the entire CPOST website contains a lot of relevant, well-researched information, including access to the database I mentioned above, if that is of interest. Regarding religiously motivated terrorism - we certainly do see that. Terrorists with an extremist interpretation of (almost always) conservative Sunni Islam often murder and mass murder (i.e. via terrorist attacks) Muslims who they feel are the \u201cwrong kind of Muslims\u201d. This can and does include Shiite Muslims, Sufi Muslims, Ahmaddiyya Muslims, and any other Muslims they feel are not the \u201cright kind of Muslims\u201d. ISIS does this, as do various terrorist groups in Pakistan and elsewhere. A key example of this is when Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban for promoting girls\u2019 education - something that they deemed \u201cunrighteous\u201d (enough to try to murder a teenage girl over). It could be argued that there\u2019s a political component here, too - that these attackers are attempting to change their societies. However, the basic motivation for the attacks is that other Muslims who are living their religion in the wrong way deserve to die. And so, I\u2019d say that that is terrorism with a religious motivation. We\u2019ve seen this dynamic among people of other religions as well - the KKK claims to be a Christian group, and they used to engage in terrorism via lynchings and other murders. The IRA is composed entirely of Catholics, and their enemies were entirely non-Catholic - but their terrorist attacks were about changing a political situation (British presence in Northern Ireland). Many people confuse the beliefs and actions of Muslim terrorists with the overall religion of Islam \u2014 but they don\u2019t make that same mistake with extremists in Christianity or Judaism. However, the dynamics are exactly the same. Regarding examples of extremist Jewish terrorists, a key reason that the British ultimately left Palestine, and ended governing it, in 1948, was due to the damage and cost incurred by attacks from Jewish terrorist groups - most notably Irgun (led by future Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin) and Lehi (aka the Stern Gang, led by future Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir). Irgun bombed the King David Hotel, in 1946, because it was the seat of Palestine\u2019s British government - and it held the record as the worst terrorist attack in human history, until the 1980s. Such attacks, again, are primarily political \u2014 not primarily religious. However, in Israel, there are quite a few terrorist groups, historically and currently, who perpetrate attacks solely due to extremist interpretations of their religion. I hope this answer was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Its my personal belief that terrorism is a result of human nature and heres why, when you run an experiment a popular way to analyzing data is call one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method and to show you what i mean ill be comparing cases by reducing the factors for you. First lets be clear, terrorism means \u201cthe unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims\u201d and this occurs in almost any situation from isis (islamic terrorism),kkk (christian terrorism) and terrorist monks in myammar (buddhist terrorism) to earth liberation front (eco terrorism) and road rage which can be considered a form of terrorism because we are using violence and intimidation on a civilian due to our belief that we have the right of way on the road and the person deserves to die for breaking the law. From the example given it should be clear that while religion can be used as a reason for it, its certainly not necessary~ What is needed however is an ideology or a notion that we are right about something. In all of those cases mentioned above there is a distinct ideology which drives the terrorism may it be religion, animal rights, or even vegan-ism. However ideology alone is not the problem as i know alot of people who are filled with ideology who are the nicest people to be with and certainly the most reasonable. Hence while it is a main ingredient in the rise of terrorism, itself on its own is not the cause similar to religion. Last but not least is the crux of the subject. There is one thing that needs to be present in all said cases that without will cause terrorism to vanish and that is ignorance~ There is a saying that goes: \u201c not knowing at all is better than knowing something wrongly because not knowing allows us to learn while knowing something wrongly makes us believe that we already know when in fact we dont\u201d and this is the case of terrorism, alot of us have a need to stand for something or to be apart of something greater and sometimes this brings us to achieve great things or motivates us to be part of a greater cause BUT sometimes through shallow understanding of a subject matter and everything that surrounds it we rile our self up and choose to stand for a political/religious/secular reason. How often do you hear girls who got enamored by isis ideology to the point of permanently disowning their parents only to find out once they fly over everything was not as it seems and they regret ever comming and begs for help to return? This problem is furthur exaggerated when you have charismatic but malicious people who uses this sentiment to their own benefits hence bringing forth organised terrorism~ For me to show you what i mean, take the Nazi\u2019s which was an extream right political movement which some might say is christian influence. fact was people at the time were going through alot of problems due to financial crisis and alot of them had anti semantic issues to begin with. putting two and two together you have a group of people who started blamming the jews for subverting the economy~ And then came a leader who through charisma and religion not only solidify the preexisting belief but also put to action those believe in the form of Jewish massacres and holocaust via riling up christian sentiments BUT hitler himself or infact the higher ups were not pious Christians themself, half of them dabbled in black magic and occult studies, they merely use christianity as a front to justify their atrocities and fact is that its the people who with their shallow understanding of their own religious ideologies who end up easily believing and hence going through with the atrocious acts~ Tldr: while religion/political ideologies are a part of the reason to why terrorism exist, the more underlying cause is the illusion of knowledge by those who claim to understand their religion/ideology (which in this context i will call idiots) and the malicious intent of those on top who may or may not believe in the same ideology but using it to rile up the \u201cidiots\u201d below into action forming a terrorist group~ ",
