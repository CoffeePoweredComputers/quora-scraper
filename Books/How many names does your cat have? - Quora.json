            "answer_text": "MY cat\u2019s full name is Bobby Bandero. When we adopted him my older sister (who he was intended for, whoops) named him Bobby, and my mum added Bandero as a reference to the voice actor of Puss in Boots, Antonio Banderas. Normally we only refer to him directly as Bobby, so that\u2019s what he thinks his name is. The Bandero is basically a surname, just for introductions or papers. I also call him \u2018kitten\u2019, \u2018kitty\u2019 or \u2018sweetie\u2019 when I call him or are greeting him, but he probably doesn\u2019t really care what I\u2019m saying anymore than the fact that I am making positive noises. I also make kissie noises when calling him, so he might think that\u2019s part of his name too. At least he recognises that when I call his proper first name he knows I\u2019m addressing him and will react accordingly\u2026if he feels like it. ",
