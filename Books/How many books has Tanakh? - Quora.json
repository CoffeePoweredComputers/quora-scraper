The books also relate the history of the Jewish nation from its earliest stage, through the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, and until the end of the first commonwealth. But the Tanach is much more than just history. In it one can learn about G-d\u2019s plan for the world and of His relationship with mankind, specifically, His chosen nation \u2013 the Jews. Here is where G-d tells us what He wants us to do! \u201cAnd now, Israel, what does the Lord your G-d want of you? Only to fear the Lord your G-d, to go in all His ways and to love Him and to serve the Lord your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul. To guard the commandments of G-d and His statutes\u2026\u201d (Deuteronomy 10 12-13) Presented here is a very short overview of each of the books of Tanach, divided into three main categories: the Chumash, the Prophets and the Writings. The Five Books of Moses (Chumash) Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy The Eight Books of the Prophets (Neviim) Joshua Judges Samuel Kings Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekial The Twelve (minor prophets) Trei-Assar The Eleven Books of the Writings (Kesuvim) Psalms \u2013 Tehilim Proverbs \u2013 Mishlei Job \u2013 Iyov Song of Songs \u2013 Shir HaShirim Ruth \u2013 Rus Lamentations \u2013 Eicha Ecclesiastes \u2013 Koheles Esther Daniel \u2013 Doniel Ezra/Nehemia Chronicles \u2013 Divrei Hayamim ",

            "answer_text": "Two ways to look at it. The Tanakh is what the Christians call the \u201cOld Testament,\u201d and to Protestants it contains 39 books (Catholics add some that are not in the Jewish canon.) However, the official Jewish version is that the three sets with I and II in their names, Samuel, Kings, and Chroicles, are one book each. This brings it down to 36. Ezra and Nechemiah are considered one book, bringing it down to 35. All 12 of the minor prophets are considered one book, bringing it down to the 24, which is the traditional Jewish number. However, I have never seen a Jewish Bible in English translation that adheres to the Jewish custom, and it does list 39 books. The order of the books, however, is different in the Jewish and Protestant Bibles. ",
