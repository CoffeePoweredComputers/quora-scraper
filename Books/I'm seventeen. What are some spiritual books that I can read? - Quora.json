            "answer_text": "The Grand Design- Stephen Hawkings. This  book contains many of the big ideas that fascinated me during my  student days. Quantum physics with its philosophical implications.  Robotics and artificial intelligence. The Conway's Game of Life. Those  ideas have helped me shape my own thinking by giving alternate  perspective of life and everything besides those I got from my  surroundings in the childhood years. It was a kind of romantic dream in  which I imagined how revolutionary those grand ideas would change the  world. At the time, the pursuit of Theory of Everything was still  ongoing. I fantasized how future life will be like when humans are able  to get away from the narrative dominated by those less scientific  approaches. The pursuit has been going with its twists and turn. This  book may be seen as a compromise of the previously ambitious attitude.  People are still killing people for many ridiculous narratives. Brief History of time - Stephen Hawkings. Hawking  structures his discussion of the beginning of time, by describing  progressively more accurate models of the Universe. He begins with the  ancient, geocentric models, continuing to the more familiar steady-state  and big bang models as he relates discoveries that required new models  of the universe. Galileo\u2019s discovery that moons orbited Jupiter forced a  heliocentric model of the universe and Newton\u2019s theory of an attractive  gravitational force and Hubble\u2019s discovery that of the red shift in  galaxies ultimately forced an expansionistic model. Thus Spoke Zarathustra - Friedrich Nietzsche. Reading  through Zarathustra as a teenager was a singularly powerful experience;  the work defies categorization or genre, time or place. It  was my first encounter with existential thought, a stinging critique of  the very nature of values and belief. The events in the book are more  like Biblical parables than a plot unfolding, except that the lesson is  not, \"Thou Shalt\" but \"Why should I?\" The God Delusion - Richard Dawkins.  For those who aren\u2019t looking to have their faith and beliefs gravely  challenged, you may want to skip this book.  Though Dawkins is looking  for everyone to read this book with an open mind, whether you\u2019re  devoutly religious, agnostic or atheist.  Having an open mind is  actually one of the New Ten Commandments Dawkins cites.  The book  begins in a calm and orderly manner, with an opening chapter on the  \u201cgod hypothesis,\u201d where Dawkins talks about the idea of a god through  history and how we are now in a time where medicine and science have  come such a long way from the days of thinking the world is flat,  balancing the humors, and believing there was a demon or god causing a  every catastrophe.  And yet religion \u2013 especially Christianity \u2013 remains  stagnated in the ideas of men from thousands of years ago.  As the book  progresses, Dawkins seems to grow more impatient with religion and its  whole-hearted certainty in a book and a god. He does an  impressive job of going from chapter to chapter in defending different  stances on science, always providing the evidence \u2013 a facet, he says,  religion is lacking. One point Dawkins makes that I really found  fascinating was his evolutionary reason for the existence of religion,  in that it was a component of our very early societies in helping to  unite communities and keep them together as a whole.

            "answer_text": "I recently conducted a survey to collect a list of the best books for spirtuality and mindful living. Some of the books i got from the list were:- How Will You Measure Your Life? - Christensen\u2019s How Will You Measure Your Life is with a book of lucid observations and penetrating insights designed to help any readerThe Eye of the I: From Which Nothing is Hidden by David - The book describes and explains advanced states of consciousness and the way to spiritual Enlightenment. You might also try to read his book Power vs force before you read this bookZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - There are a lot of great messages here in the author\u2019s search for Quality. With what many would see as too much depth and detail (but not me), he dissects the ideas of rhetoric, quality, the scientific method, technology and many ideas of the ancient Greek philosophers and tries to take down an entire academic department in the search of a unifying truth/god/connecting force.Buy Freedom from the Known - In Freedom From The Known, readers are provided with the opportunity to reflect on all of the achievements of their lives and analyze how much of it was what they truly wanted to do as opposed to what was expected of them. The author opines that people disillusion themselves into believing that societal expectations are norms that define the construct of their daily lives will bring them happiness.The Tao of Physics - This book bridged a major divide in my perception of the world, bringing together ideas of Quantum Physics and Eastern Mysticism. Capra, trained in both disciplines, does a fine job comparing quotes and emerging universal perceptions of the early pioneers in quantum physics, against philosophers and yogis of the ancient religions of the East.For the complete list you can go here, also leave your suggestions as well. Great books on learning about spirituality and mindfulness | Knowledge Maps ",
