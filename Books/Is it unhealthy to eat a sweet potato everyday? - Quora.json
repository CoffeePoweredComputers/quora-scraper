            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s unhealthy, but it could get boring. They have natural sugars, vitamins and other nutrients that regular potatoes don\u2019t have. Here\u2019s a recipe for some sweet potatoes: Twice Baked Southwestern Sweet Potatoes Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings The sweet potatoes and filling can be made ahead and refrigerated separately, or they can be stuffed and then refrigerated for a later meal. If you are warming these up from the fridge, add 10 minutes onto the baking time, or bring them to room temperature beforehand if you have time. Ingredients: 4 medium sweet potatoes, about 1/2 pound each 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 medium red onion, diced 1/2 green bell pepper, diced 1 cup black beans, rinsed well 1/2 cup sweet corn, fresh or frozen 1 cup crumbled queso fresco 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish DAD ADD: Primo Tex-Mex Ingredients: Browned chorizo Pickled jalape\u00f1os Sour cream Diced scallions Directions: Cook the sweet potatoes: If you have time, bake the sweet potatoes in the oven. Poke some holes in them with a fork and bake them at 375\u00b0F for 45 to 60 minutes until they are very tender and give easily to a fork poke. Also, the skin should get dry and crackly. Option two, if you are in a hurry, is to microwave the sweet potatoes. Poke holes in them with a fork and microwave them for two 5-minute intervals on high. They will be very hot after they come out, and the skin won\u2019t be quite as good as the baked version, but it works well for this recipe. Make the filling: In a medium skillet over medium heat, add olive oil, followed by onions, bell pepper, black beans, and sweet corn. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the vegetables soften, but aren\u2019t browned at all. Remove from heat. Stuff the sweet potatoes: When sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, split them open with a knife and use a fork to mash up the sweet potato flesh. I recommend opening up the sweet potatoes by slicing horizontal slits near each end of the sweet potato, which will make it easier to spread open. Once the sweet potato flesh is mashed, add some queso fresco to each potato and divide the saut\u00e9ed filling among the potatoes. Stuff them full! Top with any extra cheese you might have. Bake the sweet potatoes: Bake the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes at 350\u00b0F. Serve sweet potatoes with Dad Add ingredients or just a sprinkle of chopped fresh cilantro. Leftover stuffed sweet potatoes will store well in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and reheat best in the oven. ",

            "answer_text": "Better cut back on the chips and mash because eating potatoes everyday is apparently bad for you! If we were forced to eat one vegetable for the rest of our lives, that one vegetable would undoubtedly be the potato. From Maccas chips to mash, there are numerous ways to eat potatoes \u2013 and all of them are delicious. Unfortunately for all potato lovers out there, science has come to ruin the party for everyone out there. According to the NY Times, a big US study found that eating potatoes more than four times a week can increase your risk of high blood pressure.  First it was cancer, and now it\u2019s hypertension. What did we do to deserve this from the potato gods? ",
