            "answer_text": "Go thru several books on both real estate and equity investing and decide which one you like better. The 3 most assured methods to become wealthy are via real estate, equities, and your own business, so I did all 3. I suggest starting out by making sure you have an emergency savings account that covers 3 months of your total expenses (built up to 6 months over time). Next, set up a dividend re investment program and invest at least $250/mo in a no load mutual fund and utilize dollar cost averaging. (Assume historic 11% ROI of the s&p and you'll reach $1M in 28 to 30 years). Now that your retirement is guaranteed, move toward building your income and net worth to reach $1M in less than 10 years. Further diversify your investment program by purchasing precious metals, REIT's, and direct purchase stock programs on the equity side. Real estate investments should include flips and rentals for income and net worth build up. I purchase homes direct from homeowners in Preforeclosure for 20% to 30% discount to appraised value, low down assumption (lenders have never utilized the due on sale clause on any of over 100 deals I've completed), and you can inspect the property prior to purchase where you cannot when purchasing at auction. You can set your rentals up thru a property management company and keep both investments as passive income streams. ",

            "answer_text": "If you had just started investing then it's terribly hard to invest in real estate. It needs great amount of initial funds. However, you can get started investing with 500, 1k, 2k..... in stock market. So second option would be the great move. There are thousands of book or there on stock market and all are promising they are best. But it's not possible to buy and read them all in your single life. I had read more than enough books on investing. Some are crap and other are just awesome. Based on my reading experience, I had shared my ups & downs and 11 books that will change the way you look at stock market. There's no running trend for books on real estate but still the only book I found on real estate is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. However, this book also contains some tactics of stock market. ",
