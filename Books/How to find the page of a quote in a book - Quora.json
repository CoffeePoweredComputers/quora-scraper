            "answer_text": "The page number is usually found in the top or bottom outer corner of the page, or along the bottom margin. In an ebook, the reference is far harder to make as page numbers are irrelevant in ebooks. I\u2019ve been pushing for having the paragraphs numbered in an ebook, so a reader can cite a quote in their footnotes as \u201c[Title of Book], Chapter X, Paragraph Y.\u201d An ebook reading device or program would pop up the paragraph number if you hold your finger on it for any given period. For now, there is no industry standard. If you know the quote and the book it is from and you are looking for the original quote but have no bibliographical reference for it, then you are going to have to do it the old fashioned way: sit down, open the book, and start reading.
