            "answer_text": " I love this question and first off it is very doable to lose weight without formal exercise! Let\u2019s consider that you are not going to be completely stagnant and lay in a bed for the weight loss period. So let's start your journey on losing weight with out exercising! Diet and Food consumption When I was trying 2\u20133 hours a day for my ironman race I was actually \u201cfluffy\u201d with less definition. I was burning roughly 1500 calories a day and had no 6 pack to show for it! I would load in carbohydrates and extra calories I thought I needed and be pissed when my crazy training wasn\u2019t giving me a 6 pack.  The real way is to lose weight, decrease body fat percentage, and even increase BMI is to incorporate clean eating habits, control calorie intake, and types of calories digested. Incorporate a Keto lifestyle or low carb diet The Ketogenic diet is still experimental and there is not a lot of data to back it. With that being said it has helped me and tons of others decrease overall body fat with little to no change in other types of exercise habits. Here some shortcut methods for keto or low carb in your life: Take out all refined sugars; replace it with monk fruit sweeter or Stevia if you have toReplace your carbs and starches with leafy vegetablesNuts and nut butters are excellent healthy fats to add to your diet and keep you feeling fuller longer and aid in the fat burning processAvoid sugary dairy milk and use vegetarian milk alternatives. Heavy whipping cream is great for coffee and cookingIntermittent fasting Stephen Thomas\u2019s has a great answer on this page Some years ago some person had the brilliant thought that eating more meals was actually beneficial for the human metabolism. There was not a ton of scientific studies to back this and people began to learn may be that is not the right way to go. Now nutritionists are starting to understand that fasting and intermittent fasting actually helps with appetite, focus, fat-burning processes, and consuming less calories. Here are some fasting tips to incorporate into your life: 14\u201316 hour fasts into your lifestyle to decease calories, increase focus, and overall feel better. It is tough at first but then you will love only eating 2 meals a day with snack in between.Multi-day fasting - Im not a fan but have heard amazing things from other people(if you are exercising do it while you are fasting. Explosive workouts)Sneaking in tiny workouts In this situation we are going to say that these tiny workouts do not include actually exercising. Standing desk - sitting is the smoking of this generation. Get a standing desk where you work and you\u2019ll be sure to burn extra caloriesBiking or Walking to work - if this doesn't count as exercise then do this ;)Take the stairsHope you learned something but please exercise for the health benefits besides just looking good!

            "answer_text": "Though exercising is considered to be necessary for loosing weight but I think without it too we can loose weight. It is well researched and established fact that 80% of body transformation takes place with changes in diet and 20% is through exercise, so if we want to skip exercising then we need to take care of 80% that is diet. Now what to eat and what not you can easily consult online, consult dietician or Dr but I just want to add important points. Chew your food as slowly as possible (generally it's 32 times bites) , now how does that help.. It simply delays your eating time and it is said that around 30 min time is required for signals to go from stomach to brain and as brain gets signal it feels full, so you will eat less.Just down size the plate in which you eat and make a point not to refill it, take whatever you want once only.Mentally relax don't get stressed because more you are stressed more you will want to eat , you will loose focus and once brain is distracted you will not realize how much overeating you have doneSleep is important too, one should have sound sleep, it is said 7 to 8 hours sleep but I think quality of sleep is important than hour, if you can sleep few hours undisturbed and deep than it's more than enough, idea is to get your body and mind relaxed.Don't exercise but try to visit gym or go joggers park and just watch people doing exercise, by visually our brain starts thinking and acting as if our body is exercising too, so don't do physical exercise but think about it.Drink lot of water and keep yourself well hydratedGo for steam bath that will not only remove toxins but will burn fat too.Take mud therapy, in this wet mud is rubbed all around the body and you need to lie in sunlight for 30 min aprox it will gradually tighten skin and will pull out excess heat insideTake enema once a month this will remove extra toxins and will improve metabolism, better metabolism will help in reducing weight.Taking these steps will definately help in reducing weight , ofcource without exercising",

            "answer_text": " (Left) Me in November 2012 , (Right) Me in March 2019 with my partner About six years ago I weighed almost 240 pounds, my energy was low, I had mental fog, my knees ached, I had back pain and barely any self-confidence. This was my junior year of high school. I was considered obese. Today, I\u2019m 165 pounds with tons of energy, I have great focus, amazing concentration, incredible endurance, and it definitely has boosted my overall confidence. My health journey has been challenging but it\u2019s all been worth it. I didn\u2019t just want to lose weight, I wanted to look great and feel healthy. Losing weight without exercise is easy but it\u2019s not healthy. Research has shown how significant it is for us to incorporate physical activity into our daily routines as well as healthy eating for optimal health. After losing almost 100 pounds, I can assure you that exercise can be your best friend. Here are two strategies that helped me achieve my health goals: 1)Physical Activity I know that question to the article is \u2018how to lose weight without exercise\u2019 but I rather you lose weight the healthy way. From when I started wrestling at the start of senior year until the time I graduated; I lost forty pounds in two semesters. My biggest key in losing that weight was with cardio. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to run 5 miles a day. Cardio is simply any activity that actually increases your heart rate. The goal of cardio exercises is to increase your heart rate which in turn signals the body to burn calories. Aerobic/cardio exercises include walking, biking, hiking, martial arts, yoga, cleaning your yard, talking the stairs instead of the elevator and of course jogging or running. The more intense the cardio, the more calories you\u2019ll burn. Exercise also has a ton of benefits outside of only weight loss which includes: Helping you feel happierReducing stress and anxietyPreventing major diseasesImproves overall physical & mental energyHelps you sleep faster and deeperStrengthens bones and jointsImproves memory and focusThe benefits of exercise are simply powerful. If you\u2019re not taking advantage of exercise then you\u2019re missing out on higher levels of happiness and energy. The recommended amount of moderate exercise is 150 minutes a week and for intense exercises around 75 minutes per week. I\u2019d suggest starting with what you are most comfortable with. Once you\u2019ve found your chosen exercise, make sure you do it at least 3\u20135 times a week. The key when you\u2019re just starting isn\u2019t how long you work out but how frequent. The more consistent you train, the better the results. For example, I started by walking the mile as fast as I could. Then, I started to jog some of that mile as much as my body let me. The week after I ran a little longer. The week after that I ran a little more. I kept this pattern until I was running the entire mile comfortably. Your body will adapt to whatever you put it through. What made the difference were the small improvements I made each day and week to improve my stamina. As you stay consistent with exercising, your body will begin building endurance and you\u2019ll maintain your fighting weight. It\u2019s the key to living longer, healthier, and disease free. 2)Healthy Eating \u201cFood is thy medicine.\u201d - Hippocrates This is the one I struggle with the most. I know that eating healthy isn\u2019t easy by any means..I\u2019m not going to lie to you. I still make unhealthy choices from time to time but at my core I live up to my healthy principles to the best of my ability. We live in a culture where a salad costs almost 4x more than a burger. Water costs more than soda. Fruit costs more than chips and there are more fast food places then there are healthy food spots. It\u2019s easier to make an unhealthy choice then it is to make a healthy one. Convenience surrounds us all. What we consume, is what we become. Healthy eating can help us lose weight, maintain a healthy weight, prevents heart disease, enhances our mood, improves memory, and gut health. One of the biggest factors to being overweight and obese is the intake of \u2018refined carbs.\u2019 Refined carbs are generally what make people gain weight because it causes overeating and reduces overall energy because of insulin spikes. Refined carbs include: TortillasWhite breadWhite ricePastriesSodasPastasBreakfast cerealsNon-organic frozen foodsThe food corporations have made it difficult for the average person to eat healthy because most of the food here in the united states is processed with refined carbs & sugars. You don\u2019t have to cut yourself off from everything at once. That\u2019s not the point. The ultimate goal is to reduce/eliminate these foods from your daily eating habits one at a time. As you reduce your consumption of refined carbs and processed foods, you\u2019re going to want replace them with more: Fruits & VegetablesHome cooked mealsWater & TeaOrganic/Whole FoodsRefined carbs are stripped of almost all fiber, vitamins and minerals. For this reason, they can be considered as \"empty\" calories. They have little to no nutritional value. This means most refined carbs will add to your weight rather than help you lose it. Refined carbs are turned into fat when consumed excessively. Start with what you excessively eat the most first. For example, I started with what I consumed the most of which was soda. Progressively overtime I drank less and less soda. I substituted soda with tea and water. It was difficult because in the beginning my body craved the sugar and I would get headaches. I missed drinking soda so bad but I was more committed to losing weight and getting healthy; if that meant less soda then I was game. I was tired of looking and feeling the way I did. After forcing myself to drink less soda through self-control, all I had to do was apply that same discipline to another food I wanted to eat less of. I moved onto eating less white bread and tortillas which are my favorites. Your discipline to make healthy choices will get better overtime. You\u2019re not going to always make the healthiest choices and that\u2019s okay. All that matters is that you learn from that mistake and do better next time. Don\u2019t give up when it\u2019s hard because that means you\u2019re growing. You deserve to love the way you look and to feel an abundance of energy. Remember\u2026 To achieve optimal health and weight, eat whole and single ingredients carbs. If your food comes with a long list of ingredients that you can barley pronounce then it\u2019s probably not a healthy carb. If you want to see results faster then I\u2019d adopt an exercise routine. Take care of your body and it will take care of you. If you have ANY questions about what I wrote in my article or need any FREE guidance or coaching, please feel free to reach out to me!!

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can lose your weight without exercising too much. Researchers have long noted that people tend to gravitate toward those who are the most like them. We prefer people who share our political and religious views, who are of a similar heritage or geographic location and, it turns out, who have similar weights as we do. But if you\u2019re overweight and trying to drop a few pounds this could work against you, according to a study published in a 2016 issue of the journal Obesity. Researchers found that dieters lost more weight when they hung out with friends with a variety of body sizes. Here are some great tips: Change your thoughts If you think of eating veggies and hitting the gym as unbearable hardships, then they will always feel that way and you\u2019ll never do them. But if you can change your mindset, you may increase your chances of success. How? Information published in a 2018 issue of Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being found that reframing your weight loss thoughts may help. Shifting from a \u201cdieting\u201d perspective to one that focused on thoughts about simply changing the way you eat may play a role in better managing weight loss efforts. Turn up the lights Dim, sultry lighting may be ideal for a romantic dinner, but if you\u2019re watching your waistline you\u2019re going to want to brighten the place up. After all, who isn\u2019t more self-aware in bright lighting? It stands to reason, therefore, that you may be more likely to make more nutritious choices when the so-called spotlight is on you compared to dimmer environments. Ditch the diet drinks Ordering a diet soda may seem like a good compromise between sticking to your diet and still having a beverage you love. But the artificial sweeteners used in most calorie-free drinks don\u2019t lead to weight loss. In fact, they are actually associated with weight gain, according to animal research published in a 2016 issue of Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism. Outsource portion control Portion control is one way to lose weight without exercise. But while that makes sense in theory, when you\u2019re faced with the reality of a gallon of ice cream and a bowl, how exactly are you supposed to know how much a half-cup serving really is? Fortunately, taking the guesswork out of portion control is as easy as buying a set of dishes or containers that are calibrated to measure out a single serving of different types of foods. Another option is to buy food prepackaged into single-servings, like frozen entrees. It works: In a study published in Obesity, people who used outside measures of portion control lost considerably more weight than those who tried to figure it out on their own. To become one of those people, try the best portion control tricks for weight loss. Eat in your dining room Eat-in kitchens are great for convenience but may be not so great for your waistline, according to a small study published in a 2016 issue of Environment and Behavior. Researchers found that eating in open concept areas\u2014like the kitchen/great room in most new homes today\u2014make people eat more than if they were in an enclosed space. Being able to see the extra food and having such easy access to it encourages people to eat more, even if they\u2019d already eaten until they were full. Even better, load your plate with these fat-burning foods for more weight loss benefits! Dab a little vanilla on your wrists It\u2019s been said that certain scents like vanilla may help squash the desire to overeat. While it may work for some people, the Mayo Clinic recommends caution. They note that \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d when it comes to whether some scents can truly lead to sustainable weight loss. Be sure to do your research about products that claim to make you slimmer through scents. Instead, consider the tried-and-true weight loss strategy of calorie reduction and increasing exercise. Sniffing your favorite scent may be nice, but the basics are a better guarantee. Clean your kitchen Cluttered, messy kitchens take a toll on your sanity and your waistline, according to a small study published in a 2016 issue of Environment and Behavior. People who ate in a cluttered kitchen ate twice as many snacks as those who cleaned up their space. The thinking is that a chaotic environment can lead to vulnerabilities that foster unhealthy eating habits. Eat lunch with your boss Women who ate with someone they considered \u201chigh status,\u201d ate less than people who dined with those they saw as equals, according to Vanderbilt University researchers. \u201cArguably people with higher status are more weight-conscious, they\u2019re more concerned about their own body image, and they\u2019re more likely to practice weight-related lifestyle such as dietary habits and physical activities and control their weight,\u201d says Lijun Song, PhD, lead author and associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cAnd if you are surrounded by people like that, you\u2019re exposed to a stronger network norm of weight control. You\u2019re more likely to become more conscious of your body weight, more likely to receive assistance with weight management, and are more likely to observe and imitate weight-control behaviors.\u201d Vacation in the mountains There\u2019s a reason why people in Colorado may be some of the slimmest in the nation: it\u2019s one of the steepest states in the nation. According to an Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center study published in the 2014 issue of PLoS ONE, enlisted service members stationed at higher altitudes were less likely to become obese compared with those stationed at lower altitudes. But don\u2019t move just yet. It might make more sense to cultivate good weight-related habits that can be taken up anywhere, like walking outdoors and managing your stress. Avoid pollution as much as possible Children who live close to roadways with a high level of air pollution and are also exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to be obese than children who do not, according to a study from the University of Southern California. It\u2019s not clear exactly why and how air pollution may be linked to obesity, but it\u2019s never a bad idea to avoid hanging out in areas with very polluted air, like smoke-filled bars. And consider buying a filter to increase the air quality in your home. Turn down the thermostat Our climate-controlled homes may be one factor in the obesity epidemic, according to a study published in a 2014 issue of the journal Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism. The scientists found that regular exposure to mildly cold weather\u2014as would have been normal in the days before programmable thermostats\u2014helps the human body regulate a healthy weight. Chilly air may increase your metabolism by forcing your body to work harder to cope with the changing conditions. And you don\u2019t have to do a polar plunge or sleep in a snow cave to see results, say the researchers. Just lowering your thermostat by a few degrees or turning the shower briefly to cold can help. Water, on the rocks The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences notes that when you have ice water, you will burn calories in an effort to warm your body temperature up. However, it\u2019s not by much. They note that drinking cold water versus room temperature water only burns about eight calories. But it can\u2019t hurt to enjoy a refreshing glass of ice water, which can help keep you feeling full and hydrated. Take a good multivitamin Vitamins have come under fire recently for being a waste of money but if you\u2019re trying to lose weight, they might be worth your cash. In an older study of obese women published in the International Journal of Obesity, researchers found that those who took a daily multivitamin lost more body fat than those who took a placebo. Why? It\u2019s possible to be overweight yet undernourished, a state that could cause the body to crave more food as a way to get necessary nutrients. Buy blackout curtains If you fall asleep to the gentle glow of your phone\u2019s screen, the television, or even a nightlight, it\u2019s time to find a new bedtime routine. Details from a study published in a 2019 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine notes that women who slept in the presence of artificial light were more likely to gain weight than if they didn\u2019t. Such light includes sleeping with the television or light on as well as outdoor lighting coming through windows. It\u2019s thought that several factors contribute to this, including light\u2019s interference with the body\u2019s circadian rhythm. Skip the antibiotics unless you really need them The more antibiotics a person takes during their lifetime, particularly as a child, the higher their risk of obesity, according to a Johns Hopkins study. Researchers speculate that it\u2019s because the antibiotics wipe out bad bacteria along with good bacteria, which have been shown to help prevent weight gain. If you have to take an antibiotic, just be sure to take care of your microbiome, that community of gut bugs, by taking a probiotic and eating plenty of fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Eat a serving of beans every day Beans, beans the magical fruit. The more you eat the more you\u2026 lose weight? Yes, says the Mayo Clinic. They note that beans and other legumes (a class of vegetables that includes beans, peas, and lentils) are a significant part of a healthy diet. \u201cLegumes are typically low in fat, contain no cholesterol, and are high in folate, potassium, iron and magnesium,\u201d the Mayo Clinic explains. \u201cThey also contain beneficial fats and soluble and insoluble fiber.\u201d Legumes are full of fiber and protein, a combo that can keep you satisfied for hours. Get a pet Pets, and dogs in particular, are associated with a lower risk of obesity in their human companions, according to a 2013 study in the journal Circulation. Why? Dogs need to be walked daily and are often quite persistent in getting their owners to accompany them. But it\u2019s not just the extra exercise, especially since 40 percent of dog owners confess to not walking their dog on a regular basis. Their soft, silky fur and unconditional love may also play a part as petting an animal may help reduce stress and depression, two other known risk factors for weight gain, the researchers added. Swap dinner plates for salad plates A quick fix to the portion problem is to simply use smaller dishes in an effort to lose weight without exercise. Try using a salad plate instead of a larger plate or a cereal bowl instead of a mega-sized one. With a smaller area to work with, you\u2019ll be less inclined to fill up on extra calories. Buy organic Organic food may not have more vitamins than conventionally grown food, but it may offer a health advantage: No pesticides. Some pesticides are known \u201cendocrine disruptors,\u201d meaning they interfere with your body\u2019s metabolism by mimicking, blocking, or otherwise interfering with the body\u2019s natural hormones, according to a 2015 report issued in Endocrine Reviews. The researchers found that regular exposure to pesticides through food was correlated with an increased risk of both obesity and diabetes. Use chopsticks or try this fork trick Anything that slows you down when you eat can help you become more mindful of what you\u2019re eating, how much you\u2019re enjoying it, and how full you are feeling. One easy way to put a speed bump between you and your plate is to try different utensils. Chopsticks will slow most Americans down, but if you don\u2019t have pair handy, try simply switching your fork to your non-dominant hand. You\u2019ll have to concentrate harder before each bite and will pay more attention to your food. Here are seven mindful eating tricks to further draw your attention to what you\u2019re putting in your body. Swap out sweats for a cute outfit Try to avoid elastic waistbands, oversized sweaters, and other loose clothing, says certified nutrition specialist and author of the Sugar Impact Diet, JJ Virgin. Put on your favorite fitted dress, tailored jacket, or jeans, or any clothes that make you feel good. Either way, dress in a way that helps you to remind yourself that you are fabulous. Get a good night\u2019s sleep In our busy world, sleep is often the first thing to go, but skimping on even an hour of sleep can take a serious toll on your waistline. But the Mayo Clinic suggests trying to get back on track. It\u2019s possible, they say, that not enough sleep leads to fluctuations in hunger-regulating hormones. Additionally, lack of sleep could render you too tired to engage in physical activity the next day. Hit the sack early and make consistent sleep your top priority. Enjoy nature Taking a hike through the mountains is certainly good exercise but you don\u2019t have to break a sweat to take advantage of Mother Nature\u2019s health package. Simply being outside in \u201cgreen areas\u201d has been linked to having a lower body weight, according to research done by the American Diabetes Association. Chances are, you already live within walking distance or relatively nearby some type of park. Get out there and explore your neighborhood. Watch food additives Junk food isn\u2019t great for your weight or your health, but it turns out it\u2019s not just the empty calories and trans fats doing the damage. The Mayo Clinic notes that added sugars may be linked to obesity and other health issues. Though more research is needed, it\u2019s probably best to stay in line with the American Heart Association\u2019s guidelines. They suggest: no added sugar for children younger than age 2, no more than 100 calories from added sugar a day for children older than age 2 and most women, and no more than 150 calories from added sugar a day for most men. Order from the menu The next time you go out to eat, skip the buffet and order a dish off the menu. It\u2019s only logical; the greater the variety of food you see, the more your brain wants to taste each one. So, order from the menu. This way, you\u2019ll eat only the food on your (one) plate. Say Om Sometimes we eat because we\u2019re hungry. And sometimes we eat because we\u2019re bored, procrastinating, tired, sad, stressed, or thirsty. Knowing the difference between real hunger and, well, everything else, is a major key to losing weight. Fortunately there\u2019s a simple tool to help you hear what your body\u2019s really telling you. Consider meditation. It can teach you to tune in to your body\u2019s subtle signals, including hunger cues. The next time you\u2019re tempted to down a glazed doughnut or a giant Coke, try doing a minute or two of meditation. You may just realize you\u2019re actually dehydrated and go for a water instead. Mindfulness may also help children. A study published in a 2016 issue of Heliyon explains that increases in a child\u2019s impulsivity may lead to increases in body fat. Therefore, mindfulness may help decrease such urges and subsequently, maintain an ideal weight. Look before you eat Do you eat healthfully at home but get distracted from your weight-loss goal by delicious food at parties? Look before you leap. Just browse all the available food first before taking a bite. Looking first can help you prioritize which ones you enjoy the most and which ones you don\u2019t like as much. That way, you don\u2019t end up putting a whole bunch of food on your plate and end up ending things you really don\u2019t thoroughly enjoy. Planning out your meal will teach you how to eat more mindfully, which will help you successfully lose weight without exercise. Tie a ribbon on it The \u201cfemmes fran\u00e7aises\u201d are famously svelte despite being surrounded by French bread, French pastries, and delicious French food in general. How is this possible? Some French women tie a ribbon around their waist and under clothing while dining. If the ribbon starts tightening, it\u2019s a reminder to consider easing up on another trip to that buffet. In addition to France, take a look at these weight loss secrets from around the world. ",

            "answer_text": "In a span of six months I have lost almost 18 kg's from 78kg then  to 60kg now.So I will surely put down my tips , if it can help you in someway or other.You are saying you have lack of time but, What I believe is if you really want to lose weight(or anything), you somehow create or take out time for that automatically. I too had my college from 8 or 9 (it varied per day). and engg. is pretty hectic considered so many activities( expect studies :P) . So taking out time was not easy for me either but my internal call inspired every second !Don't plan out too much about how will do it. Just start the process, everything what you thingk right now is important will come to you automatically as the process goes. What I did to lose 18KG of fat-shaped-demon -1)Morning walk - 30 mins2)hour : pranayam(especially kapalbhaati and anulom bhilom) 3) Half hour: yoga(specific yoga asanas to lose weight)4)One glass of warm water with lemon and honey in the morning.5) Completely restricted any sort of junk food for these 6 months. Completely means completely. It was tough and i did it somehow.6) Avoided food items : cold drinks, tea, coffee, chips, bhujia, sweets, chocolates, and even biscuits. Ate rotis, lots of fruits, lots of green vegetables, avoided oil , butter, ghee (these were my favourites). I was so determined about my lifestyles that I even avoided invitation to marriages(the junky food harms man!), would join friends birthday party but denied to eat anything giving hell of excuses.7)4-5 litres of water per day. OUTCOME : I lost 18KG in six month. Not only that, I can realise how healthy and fit I am feeling now. My digestive system seems so good now. My complete health took a new perspective(it wasn't bad either before, but it got better now). I won't say that now also I complete avoid the foods which I mentioned above, but I restricted the limit . And trust me , I even don't like eating junk foods now, (the call is internal). STAY 100% STRICT FOR FEW MONTHS, YOU WILL SURELY GET BENEFITED. P.S.- Don't fast every other day, Keep eating but healthy food not junk. Make the fruits , green vegetables, gourd(lauki) , amla, your friends. ",

            "answer_text": " I was about 163 @~18% body fat\u2026 a little over 1 month ago. Clearly not, that, anymore. I\u2019m about 138 now. I\u2019ll let you estimate from the photo how my composition has changed. I didn\u2019t have that much muscle a month ago either\u2026 and it was friggin\u2019 easy. Anyone who tells you it\u2019s hard is either lying, or more than likely just doesn\u2019t know this. Well, it works. And I\u2019m actually pretty pissed that it was so easy. Because of why it was so easy\u2026 Remember this? \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat very often, your metabolism will slow down. You don\u2019t want that! That would just make it harder to lose weight! You want evenly spaced meals, smaller, so you can eat more often and speed your metabolism up! Wouldn\u2019t that be good? You don\u2019t eat less, you just eat more often. Portion control! You just need to make sure you eat less than you burn everyday. Plus get plenty of exercise, that makes a huge difference. A healthy diet and exercise is all you need.\u201d Translation: \u201cDon\u2019t spend less money that would be bad! Spend more money! Wouldn\u2019t that be good?\u201d It was the biggest, most heinous lie of our generation. I don\u2019t know if they meant to kill millions of people, and make hundreds of millions of others very fat, ballooning out of control. But people were just doing what they were told. People actually do that? It turns out? Yes! People don\u2019t just have character flaws or a lack of discipline. Or \u201csnowflake\u201d metabolisms: \u201ceveryone is different!\u201d They\u2019ve been following the moronic, money driven diet advice that was spread across the country. On purpose! To confuse people and keep them from discovering the truth. I hate some people. People who could do this. For money. Like I said, maybe they didn\u2019t know what it would really do. But it was reckless in the first place, and absolutely unforgivable when it wasn\u2019t corrected in 1990 when the problem could have been identified. I\u2019m sure it was, by the medical community. But doctors that know this toil in obscurity for some reason. We have known about insulin, and what it does, for 100 years. For 100 years, or less, we have had gyms, diet books, fitness tapes, personal trainers, weight sets, home gyms, home fitness equipment, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig\u2026 the dieting people!! Sell you itty bitty tiny meals to eat often. Just often enough, that the space between your first meal of the day (breakfast! The most important meal of the day, remember?) and your last meal, is greater than 12 hours. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the secret. The one they didn\u2019t want you to know. That\u2019s all it takes to guarantee, you will slowly but surely: put on a few pounds a year. No matter how much you diet, how much you exercise, this is the likely outcome. You can lose weight eating the way you were told. By making your body think it is starving. That is what this advice, actually does. If this was,\u2014in fact\u2014on purpose to preserve all of those sales\u2026 the collateral damage of that lie has indeed amounted to the greatest genocide ever perpetrated in the whole of human history. I hope that was an accident. But it was happening right in front of us, the whole time, for as long as I\u2019ve been alive. Well, I was just trying to lose weight like the rest of you (I was successful, -20 lbs of fat only in - month. It was easy.) But what I found, needs to be shared with humanity. I could\u2019ve sit on it, developed a whole fitness program that actually works. Try to obscure the truth, keep people from figuring out what I\u2019m actually doing. Maybe it\u2019s not as simple as I think for many. But no. I could never live with myself. This is how it happened, and this is how to fix it: Whenever you eat anything it bumps your insulin. The USDA official dietary recommendations over the past 30 years have recommended no less than 25% and upto what was it when I was a kid? A little over half? In pasta, rice, cereal, flour. Our diets are just filled with grains. Carbohydrate. Sugar. That\u2019s what this is. Our diets are half composed of sugar. It\u2019s basically running the country. And because of this, our blood glucose is always elevated. So insulin allows a bit of sugar into the body cells. Just a little spike. That\u2019s all it takes. A sugar cube. Or a sandwich. Or a 9 course meal. Same difference, essentially. Insulin only needs to open those channels for a fraction of a second. Long enough to let a little sugar in. The more sugar there is in your blood, the higher the effect of that tiny little part of a second of open access to your cells: the more sugar they take in. This has profound implications for our metabolism. Fat is everywhere. We store 100 000 kcal of food energy in fat, weeks of it. It floats through cell membranes like they weren\u2019t even there. Cells always have access to fat. But they like sugar. It\u2019s easier to burn. And! It can be turned into fat! Why burn the fat that\u2019s sitting right here, when there\u2019s perfectly good sugar. If there\u2019s too much of it, good ol\u2019 liver will turn it into fat for us! Great! As long as\u2026 that\u2019s what you want. Which, it used to be. Sometimes. We have combined relatively high average blood sugar, with frequent spikes of insulin. Just pumping sugar into our cells. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you eat. Your blood sugar is always about the same if you\u2019re carb fed, it\u2019s kept that way for a reason. So your body can use meal frequency to decide what to do. Spike your insulin often, sugar concentration gets high in cells. They never have a chance to burn through it before more sugar is coming in. This means that with each spike of insulin, less and less sugar is getting into your cells, they\u2019re starting to get full. So it starts backing up into your blood. The liver gets wind of this and starts synthesizing fat (which it really isn\u2019t supposed to do for a few years straight, let alone decades. Heard of fatty liver?) You are insulin resistant. You are in fat storage mode. They are one and the same. That is why. The answer by now, I hope is obvious. Restrict your cells\u2019 access to sugar. Which means spiking your insulin less often. That way they actually run out of sugar sometimes. And have to burn fat. Then you lose fat. How could you not? That\u2019s all you have to do to lose fat without exercising. And, by the way. You don\u2019t need to eat every day.  So, this answer started when I was reading a pretty good Keto answer, but he had the fat storage stuff wrong. I was going to just leave a comment, but I decided I could do better job myself. I hope you enjoyed it. That comment turned into a diatribe on the benefits of fasting. And I decided that closing was too much of a tease so I\u2019ve included the comment that turned into this below. The writing style is\u2026 more technical. Above is supposed to be compelling for a general audience, but if you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019re on board. And I\u2019m less afraid to scare you away with dense language and jargon, but it\u2019s kinda just for reference. This answer wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning fasting. 100% the healthiest, most effective way to stop burning muscle, start burning pure fat, and lose as much of it as you want. Your body even takes care of the extra skin for you, how cool is that? And it\u2019s free. Bet you don\u2019t wonder why you thought it was a \u201cnatural health craze\u201d that \u201cmight even be dangerous\u201d\u2026.. I do have some feedback. The stuff about glucagon. Glucagon just releases liver glycogen into the blood. It doesn\u2019t regulate fat metabolism. It doesn\u2019t even have an effect on blood glucose when you\u2019re in long term ketosis. Insulin regulates fat metabolism on its own. You always have baseline insulin. When it falls to baseline, it switches off glucose metabolism everywhere but the brain, red blood cells and inner medulla of the kidney. Since fat is always floating around everywhere, like cell membranes weren\u2019t even there, the cells already have fat. They just prefer to use glucose. But they\u2019ll use fat no problem. The pathway becomes efficient enough to supply 100% of your energy needs and you never have to burn muscle again in about 4 days. You can actually stop eating until your usable fat runs out. As long as you drink water. This isn\u2019t dangerous. You said you can go days without food\u2026 you can go weeks or months. Your cells sequester about 3 months of nutrients, you can leech minerals from your skeleton for that long as well without issue. Water fasting is fine. Keto is basically water fasting with non-insulinergic food. Insulin actually makes no difference to fat metabolism if your blood glucose is at physiologic baseline (about 30\u201350 mg/dl). That\u2019s why you can eat protein and remain in ketosis. And why it doesn\u2019t matter when you eat on Keto. The insulin bump from the protein doesn\u2019t do anything but get amino acids into cells the same way it gets glucose there: surface pores that bind insulin. Feeding protein during a fast will trigger mTOR and turn off Autophagy though, so a significant amount of weight to lose would bias the recommendation to water fast to ensure the extra skin is metabolized for the trickle of glucose your brain needs.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a perennial question: Can you lose weight without exercise? Let\u2019s start with this: Exercise is terrific for your body and mind, in so many ways. It cuts down on your risk for a multitude of diseases and can lower your incidence of depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems, as well as boost your energy, help you sleep, and more. It can also help you get and keep a fitter, slimmer body. So exercise = health, and we should all move our bodies every day. That said, when it comes to losing weight, what you eat is key\u2014and studies show there are plenty of weight loss strategies that have nothing to do with exercise. Check out these 14 science-backed, slim-down tips. 1. Control your portions. When you\u2019re at home, eat from smaller plates and bowls. You\u2019ll likely take in fewer calories, and it tricks your brain into thinking you\u2019re chowing down on more than you actually are. (Do the opposite when you\u2019re eating healthy foods, like salads or roasted veggies then it makes sense to supersize those dishes!). Another important tip: Don\u2019t eat from packages of anything, even those \u201chealthier\u201d chips or crackers. Portion some out into a dish, and put the bag or box away. When eating out, portion control can be a tougher challenge, given the giganto serving sizes in restaurants, so before you go, think about how you\u2019re going to handle that. You can order an appetizer and small salad instead of an appetizer and main dish; you can split a dish with a friend; or you can ask for a to-go box right up front, and put half your meal in there before you dig in. Have a plan and intention ahead of time and you\u2019re more likely to stick to it. 2. Eat more fiber. \u201cFiber helps with weight loss in so many ways,\u201d says Karen Ansel, M.S., R.D.N., author of Healing Superfoods for Anti-Aging: Stay Younger, Live Longer. \u201cFor starters, it expands in your gut like a sponge so it\u2019s a natural appetite suppressant. Plus, the latest research is finding it has beneficial impacts on good gut bacteria that help produce hormones in the gut that tell your brain you\u2019ve had enough to eat. Aim for at least 25 grams a day from a variety of foods like whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables.\u201d  3. Load up on protein too. \u201cLike fiber, protein naturally helps you feel full by influencing the production of satiety hormones,\u201d says Ansel. \u201cIt takes a long time to digest, so you\u2019re unlikely to go scrounging for a snack after a protein-rich meal. And here\u2019s a neat trick: Protein also takes more energy to digest than, say, fat or carbs, so you don\u2019t store as many of its calories. For maximum impact aim for 20 grams per meal from lean proteins such as fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, and low fat dairy.\u201d 4. Get enough sleep. It\u2019s well-established that sleep deprivation can lead to weight gain. It comes down to hormones: Sleep deprived people produce more ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone. And they produce less leptin, the hormone that tells you when you\u2019ve eaten enough. There\u2019s also evidence that the overly-sleepy eat more calories, and more comfort-food-carbs. And it\u2019s no surprise that when you\u2019re exhausted, it\u2019s harder to control your impulses (meaning, grabbing cookie after cookie may seem like a fine idea). 5. Weigh yourself. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of getting on the scale a few times a week,\u201d says Ansel. \u201cFor a lot of people, weighing yourself can be stressful, but it can provide some really important feedback before things start to snowball. You don\u2019t have to weigh yourself every day, but stepping on the scale two to three times a week can help you nip weight gain in the bud, so you don\u2019t have to take drastic action with your diet later.\u201d 6. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Sometimes when you think you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re actually thirsty\u2014maybe even slightly dehydrated. So in between meals, before you nosh on a snack try drinking a big glass of water. It\u2019s also a good idea to do that before a meal: It leads to greater weight loss, one study showed. And carry a bottle with you throughout the day, to sip as you go. 7. Cut down on sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether sugar in and of itself makes you gain weight,\u201d says Ansel. \u201cBut one thing is for sure it tends to travel in foods that have way too many calories. Whether it\u2019s soda, sweetened lattes, or dessert, these should be the first foods to go if you\u2019re trying to slim down.\u201d And remember, the sweet stuff is hidden in all sorts of foods ketchup, bread, salad dressing, and so on. 8. Don\u2019t drink your calories. It\u2019s a simple way to take in less calories overall. But there\u2019s another important reason to follow this rule: Drinking calories, rather than eating them, is less satisfying and doesn\u2019t lead to the same feeling of fullness, research shows. So that\u2019s another reason why drinking your calories especially sugary bevs can lead to weight gain. 9. Eat more mindfully. In other words, slow down. Your brain needs to catch up with your mouth and send the signal that you\u2019re full, and that\u2019s harder when you\u2019re speeding through your meal. Also, studies have shown that when you\u2019re distracted, you tend to eat more. So stash your phone, turn off the TV, and pay attention to what you\u2019re eating. 10. Chew more. A small study showed that \u201cprolonged chewing\u201d at lunch leads to a eating fewer snacks later in the day. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that many of the study participants reported that they really didn\u2019t enjoy the lunch, with all that chomping. So worth a try, but it may or may not work for you. If you want to know more about this, then I suggest you this link lose weight without exercise. I hope it will help you to know more details about the weight loss without exercise. ",

            "answer_text": "How could you burn calories without exercise? You can do it to lose weight easily but not without exercise (I thought). So you\u2019re going to lose some weight and you are looking around online to find some tips that will help you do that in a quick healthy way. That\u2019s actually a great idea because there is a huge amount of information on the internet about rapid weight loss. Some work pretty well and some not so well. Whatever tips you decide to follow, make sure you get the advice of a doctor before you start on anything. It is always a good idea to talk to him/her first so they can help you out with any misconceptions you might have about how to lose weight in a healthy way. There are a ton of different ideas you can choose from, but you want to make sure that the ideas you decide to implement are going to be ones that will help you instead of hurting you. No point in trying to lose a few pounds by doing something that is really going to hurt your health-wise. Take a look at these couple of tips and they might get you started in the right direction for releasing weight and learning to keep it off. Eat More Protein Many times, in our modern microwave world, people eat a lot, but they simply do not get the right amount of protein in their diet. This does not mean that you need to go all the way over to the dark side and start hunting for meat on the hoof in your local park. But it does mean that your health and weight could improve if you simply added some healthy protein into your diet Try something easy and that is available everywhere like tuna fish. This tried and true staple of American homes is a great source of lean protein, especially if you get the kind that is packed in water. True enough, if you decide you are going to live on this as your sole source of nutrition you might have a few other issues. But for the most part if you eat tuna for one of your meals every other day or so, your body will thank you for letting go of all those extra pounds it was carrying around for you. Lift More Weight (Sorry, you don\u2019t like this) Lifting weights is one of those exercises ideas that is often misunderstood. For some reason, the thought of lifting weights brings to mind pictures of enormous biceps, popping out with veins all over. Truth is, lifting weights; even light weights can be a great idea for someone who wants to lose some weight fast. To start with, you really only need a couple of very lightweights. Something in the 3 or 5-pound range. And you only need to do a few repetitions of any exercise. It is perfectly OK to start with a simple exercise like a curl. This is where you pick up the weight and bend your arm at the elbow so that you move the weight up towards your shoulder. Then move it back down. You can do this standing or sitting, and to start with just do a few repetitions with each arm, no more than 5 or 10 times. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t want to be sore, you just want to help your body burn some fat and get healthier. I hope you enjoy the tips. It\u2019s time to follow... YOU CAN DO THIS\u2026\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "In The Machinist (2004), Christian Bale plays the role of Trevor Reznik, a machinist with severe insomnia. The lack of sleep leads to severe weight loss, so Trevor Reznik becomes extremely thin. To be fit for Trevor Reznik character, Christian Bale needed to look drastically thin, so he had to lose a lot of weight, from 173 pounds to 110 pounds.To lose these 63 pounds, the actor followed a draconic diet: for almost four months he ate only one can of tuna fish and/or one apple per day. This type of diet is a very low calorie diet, ensuring only 50-260 calories/day. There are 194 calories in one can (6.5 ounce) of tuna in water (drained) and one medium size apple (about 150 g) has 80 calories. The \u201cmenu\u201d was completed with black coffee and water.  Besides the extremely low calorie intake, the foods chosen for this diet are, by themselves, metabolism boosters. Due to the caffeine content, coffee increases the metabolism. The apples are high in sugar and pectin (a soluble fiber) which dampens down the appetite. To lose weight faster, Christian Bale exercised hard. The star\u2019s exercise regime included intensive cardio workouts and intensive resistance/weight training workouts. To protect his health, the actor took each day vitamin supplements. If you are interested in following the Tuna and Apple Diet, remember that the very low calorie diets are  recommended only for extremely overweight (obese people), under medical supervision, and for a limited period of time (up to 12 weeks). Also keep in mind that most people who want to lose weight do not need to eat a very low calorie diet. The doctor should be the one to decide if such a diet is appropriate for you. On general basis, a very low calorie diet is not suitable for pregnant and breastfeeding women, for children and teenagers and for adults over 50 years old.Cutting calories significantly can cause serious health problems such as gallstones, heart problems, anemia, fatigue, constipation or diarrhea, and nausea. To stay healthy, people need to eat various foods from different food groups. During a very low calorie diet, when your daily calorie intake is as little as 250-800 calorie, it is quite difficult to get good nutrition. It is obvious that if you eat only tuna and apples for 12 weeks, your body will lack a lot of nutrients and this thing will be soon reflected by your state of health.. from. https://diethics.com/christians-bale-diet-apple-and-tuna-diet/ ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, here are some tips that I can give you for you to lose body fat without doing any workout: 1) Get enough sleep (but not too much) every night Most adults feel rested after about 7 or 8 hours of sleep. Sleeping less than five hours or more than eight hours each night can increase your risk of accumulating fat in the body if you are under 40, according to a US study.  Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep regularly can also help improve your mood and reduce your stress level. This also reduces your risk of accumulating fat because people under stress tend to have too high a level of the hormone cortisol, which is linked to the accumulation of fat. 2) Create a calorie deficit You will melt the fat if you lose more calories than what you are consuming. Through a balanced diet and exercise you can burn easily about 0.5 to 1 kilo of fat per week by subtracting from 250 to 1000 calories per day. Men should not eat less than 1500 calories per day. Women should eat at least 1200 calories a day. 3) Reduce consumption of saturated fats, trans fats and added sugars Instead of eating these bad fats and bad sugars, eat foods high in fiber such as wholemeal pasta, brown rice, oat flour, berries, citrus fruits, green vegetables, and lima beans. The dietary fiber longer satisfies you and nutrient density in plant foods helps to keep you healthy without compromising your goal of creating a calorie deficit.  Since you need a little protein in your diet, eat larger amounts of lean protein (including beans, nuts, tofu, skinless chicken breast). Eat fish, nuts, avocados, seeds and vegetable oils to incorporate good fats to your diet. Of course, doing exercise or any workout would really expedite your weight loss. I hoped this helped you. I have four more tips about losing weight without (or very minimal workout). You can read it here: Part 2: What is the best way to lose body fat without doing any workout?  ",

            "answer_text": "Hi friend, That's a good question, and I'll be happy to try to answer it. I do not know if you are trying to lose a little weight or a lot so I will try to bring a suitable answer to people who have a lot of weight to lose. And for whom this goal is a focus. First things first. Change your bad eating habits. And understand the amount of food you need to lose weight. These two principles are really simple, except for people who do not know much about nutrition. And that's what makes the difference. Inform yourself about the nutritional values \u200b\u200bof the foods you are used to consuming and compare them to those who are considered healthy to be aware of the difference. Read the labels on the packages of the food you buy, and learn to understand why a regularly eaten food tends to make you gain weight compared to another healthy food that stagnates in weight. In fact, there is no need to do sports to lose weight. It is an idea that the world of sports business likes to convey .. You just have to be active, to have an activity. Do not sit all day doing nothing. Live and move, simply. In the vast majority of cases, change to a HEALTHY FOOD, eat ADAPTED QUANTITIES and reduce carbohydrates, especially foods high in sugar (sweets, sodas, cakes, syrup, jam, chocolate, cereals called \"fitness\") allows people to lose weight. What i do : I bought myself a kitchen scale, and I weigh what I eat when I start a new diet. When I want to gain weight or lose weight, I calculate my maintenance according to my activity, my weight, my size.. (you can find it quickly on the internet). That is, I know how much I need to ingest protein, carbohydrates, fats and calories (Kcal) a day so that I do not lose or gain weight. It\u2019s called the \u2018MAINTENANCE\u2019. It\u2019s really an important concept to understand, cause the better way to lose weight is to go for it gradually. Do not reduce the quantity drastically. If I want to lose weight, I reduce these quantities, if I want to take it I increase. It's that simple. I weigh myself once a week and I compare my weight, if I want to lose weight and it has not moved, I reduce a little bit more quantities until it moves .. Then, once I'm used to it, I do not have to weigh anything anymore because I know what I put on my plate and what I need. People who say that they do not want to weigh their food ... when they have problems with weight and fat, most of the time do not even know what this or that food is ... It\u2019s not because a blind man rides at 50 km / h rather than 90 km / h that he will not crash anyway. So learn first, and to learn you have to do something concrete. You have to see it, to quantify it. People who say that : just eating when you're hungry until you're not hungry anymore, while eating healthy food : bullshit. First, SCOOP : \u201cHEY you can gain weight by eating healthy food :D\u201d ... Hunger is a twisting mechanism of our body. It depends directly on your eating habits. The more you eat, the more you are used to eating too much, the faster you'll be hungry, and the more hungry you'll feel. If you start to eat less than before, you will feel hungry. After one week you will not feel it anymore, without changing anything. There are nutrition YouTubers that are good tips. I am French so I do not have an English channel to advise you. You must look a little by yourself :). Maybe someone will advise you in the comments ( i hope so ). Joining a forum of people who have already achieved weight loss mixed with people losing weight who post their meal etc.. is also a good idea if you have the courage to do it. I searched for some links to give .. Here to know how much you need to eat according to your body and activity : Calorie Calculator Here a calorie counter on Excel, with a tuto :Excel Calorie Counter I\u2019m not a nutritionist, sport profesional or whatever \u2026 i just learned things from people and internet. So .. my words can be questionable.. but all i said in this answer, i already did it for me and it works :) hope it will be the same for you. I hope this answer is adequate :D much love everybody ) see ya ",

            "answer_text": "Is there a safe way to lose weight without exercise? Exercise has many benefits and it does help burn calories, but when it comes to losing weight it\u2019s really all about diet-diet-diet!!! I do a LOT of exercising so please don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s an important part of any diet but what many people neglect to realize is that our bodies are very efficient and the majority of calories we burn actually goes towards supporting our body, not so much exercise: our existence is our biggest consumption of energy! Also, when we exercise, depending on exertion levels, about half the calories burned comes from glycogen while the other half comes from fat: once we burn glycogen, our body will want it back and it prompts us with hunger to replenish: most people make the mistake of over-estimating how many calories they burned while also under-estimating how many calories they are consuming and then, having exercised, feel entitled to eat a bit more: literally washing-out and negating the calories they burned from exercise! There are 2 main benefits to exercise while dieting: it connects us psychologically with being pro-active and making the change happen. If you think about it, dieting is really passive: you simply don\u2019t eat and you\u2019re doing it. With exercise, you\u2019re making, forging and pushing in a lean direction. Next, besides the endorphins created by exercising, the use of our muscles tells our body that we\u2019re using the muscle and not to spare it: this is important since as much as 50% of weight lost while dieting comes not from fat but instead from lean body mass; so exercise helps us retain our muscle and not look scrawny or emaciated as we lose weight. Your \u2018safe way\u2019 to lose weight is to simply eat clean/whole foods\u2026.more overly, just get rid of all the junk food, processed foods and foods all jacked-up with salts, fats and sugar. If you keep your foods to vegetables, lean meat and some complex carbs then your foods will be just interesting enough that you\u2019ll eat to a reasonable level and not over-consume. ",

            "answer_text": "14 ways to lose weight without diet or exercise Regimented diet plans can be challenging to stick to for prolonged periods. It can also be hard to find the time to exercise. Is it possible to lose weight without doing either? Using a variety of methods of weight control is vital for maintaining a healthy body weight. In this article, learn 14 techniques that people can use to lose weight without diet or exercise. 1. Boost your cooking skills Learning how to cook a variety of meals may aid weight loss. Understanding how to prepare meals and developing better skills in the kitchen can be a powerful way to lose weight without reducing food intake. People who have more knowledge about how to cook different foods are more likely to eat a wide variety of highly nutritious ingredients, including fruit and vegetables, which are great for weight loss. In fact, researches are increasingly linking weight gain and obesity to poor cooking skills. People who are not confident in the kitchen can try taking a cookery class or watching cooking videos online. A great place to start is Jamie Oliver's Food tube, which focuses on how to make simple, healthful meals. 2. Eat more protein Protein is an essential part of a healthful diet and is necessary for growth and efficient metabolism. Protein can increase feelings of fullness and delay hunger. A smaill study in young women found that eating high-protein yogurt as an afternoon snack reduced hunger and calorie intake at later meals. Simple ways to increase the amount of protein in the diet include adding a tablespoon of chia seeds or hemp seeds to breakfast cereals or including more eggs in meal plans. 3. Eat more fiber Fiber is in fruit, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Fiber is different than other foods because the body does not digest it in the small intestine. Instead, the food moves to the large intestine, where fermentation occurs. This benefits people by: increasing fullnessslowing down digestionincreasing food transit time and nutrient absorptionPeople can add more fiber into a balanced diet by: eating fruit every dayincluding whole grains in the diet, such as steel-cut oats and brown riceeating plenty of vegetablesThe fiber in the skin of many vegetables is also beneficial. As long as people thoroughly wash the skin, it is safe and easy to eat when cooked. 4. Try a probiotic Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that are integral to digestion. Recent research links gut and brain function and suggests that probiotics can influence weight, fat mass, and mood. Humans act as the host of these bacteria and provide them with food, including fiber. In turn, the bacteria benefit the intestine and a person's general health. The benefits that they provide include: energy for the gut wall and liver cellsspecific fatty acids that have anti-cancer propertiesregulating body weightA diet that is high in sugar and fat can alter the balance of bacteria in the gut, reducing the number of good bacteria. Probiotics also occur naturally in a variety of fermented foods, including: yogurtkimchisauerkrautkefirmisotempehkombucha5. Get more sleep A good night's rest is essential for general health and weight maintenance. Poor sleep disrupts important hormones, including those involved in metabolism. 6. Reduce stress Yoga can reduce stress and aid weight loss. Raised stress levels can also disrupt hormonal balance. When a person is stressed, their body produces hormones called glucocorticoids. Too many glucocorticoids can increase a person's appetite, leading to weight gain. Stress can also trigger emotional eating.Emotional eating is when a person eats unhealthful foods to try to control and improve a negative mood. Methods to reduce stress include: getting regular exercisereducing caffeine intakepracticing meditation or mindfulnesssaying no to non-essential commitmentsspending time outdoors7. Get more vitamin D Some research indicates that those with low Vitamin D blood levels are more likely to be obese and not get enough exercise. People can get vitamin D from the sun and some foods. Foods that contain vitamin D include egg yolks, fatty fish, certain mushrooms, and fortified foods. Vitamin D supplements are also available to purchase in pharmacies or online. 8. Serve food in multiple small portions This method is most useful in a buffet or snacking situation. One study divided single meals into smaller portions to test whether people expected to feel fuller after eating the same amount of food in separate units. They found that by dividing foods into three or six separate portions, the participants' expected level of fullness was greater. When eating at a buffet, a person can take multiple small plates to split the food across. When snacking, they can cut up the snacks and place them on different small plates. A person can also try dividing mealtimes up into several small courses, instead of putting everything on one plate. 9. Use a smaller plate When people serve food onto a plate, they trend to finish all the food on that plate. They could lower their calories with minimal effort by reducing the size of their plate or how much food they put on it. Two 2017 studies found that university students consistently put less food on a special portion control plate. A portion control plate has visual size indicators for essential food groups, allowing people to adjust their portions without the guesswork. Portion control plates are available in some stores and online. 10. Cut out sugary beverages Adding herbs or fruit to water may help curb cravings for sugary drinks. British research linked the regular consumption of sugary and artificially sweetened drinks with higher body fat in children. There are many healthful alternatives to soft drinks. Plain water with fresh , mint ,berries, or cucumber is refreshing and contains very few calories. People can also add lime or lemon to sparkling water. Herbal, green, and black teas are also suitable. Many teas come with additional health benefits. Fruit juices tend to be very high in sugar. When possible, it is best to eat whole fruits instead as they contain fiber. ",

            "answer_text": "11 Proven Ways to Lose Weight Without doing Exercise: Sticking to a conventional exercise plan can be difficult. However, there are several proven tips that can help you \"mindlessly\" eat fewer calories . These are effective ways to reduce your weight, as well as to prevent weight gain in the future. Here are 11 ways to lose weight without exercise. All of them are based on science. 1. Chew Thoroughly and Slow Down Your brain needs time to process that you've had enough to eat. Chewing your food better makes you eat more slowly , which is associated with decreased food intake, increased fullness and smaller portions. How quickly you finish your meals may also affect your weight. 2. Use Smaller Plates For Unhealthy Foods The typical food plate is larger today than it was a few decades ago. This is unfortunate, since using a smaller plate may help you eat less by making portions look larger. 3. Eat Plenty of Protein Protein has powerful effects on appetite. It can increase the feeling of fullness, reduce hunger and help you eat fewer calories. 4. Store Unhealthy Foods Out of Sight Storing unhealthy foods where you can see them may increase hunger and cravings causing you to eat more. 5. Eat Fiber-Rich Foods Eating fiber rich foods may increase satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer. Studies also indicate that a special kind of fiber , called viscous fiber, is particularly helpful for weight loss. It increases fullness and reduces food intake. 6. Drink Water Regularly Drinking water can help you eat less and lose weight, especially if you drink it before a meal. One study in adults found that drinking half a liter (17 oz) of water, about half an hour before meals, reduced hunger and helped them eat fewer calories. 7. Serve Yourself Smaller Portions Portion sizes have increased during the last few decades, especially at restaurants . 8. Eat Without Electronic Distractions Paying attention to what you eat may help you eat fewer calories. People who eat while they're watching TV or playing computer games may lose track of how much they have eaten. This, in turn, can cause overeating. 9. Sleep Well and Avoid Stress When it comes to health, sleep and stress are often neglected. But in fact, both can have powerful effects on your appetite and weight. 10. Eliminate Sugary Drinks. 11. Serve Unhealthy Food on Red Plates One weird trick is to use red plates to help you eat less. At least, this seems to work with unhealthy snack foods. One study reported that volunteers ate fewer pretzels from red plates, compared to white or blue plates . ",

            "answer_text": " We all have those days where no matter how hard we try, we just can\u2019t find time for a workout. Maybe you got stuck in traffic, held up at work, or suffered an injury. The good news is, just because you can\u2019t exercise, does not mean that you have to give up on losing weight! These tips to lose weight when you can\u2019t work out will help you continue making progress regardless of how hectic your day is. The following tips offer simple, yet highly effective, options to reduce your weight without exercising. Contrary to popular belief, exercise is not essential to weight loss (although it is highly recommended when you can). While you can lose weight without exercising if you maintain a healthy diet, you can\u2019t lose weight if you exercise but eat whatever you want. For this reason, on the days you can\u2019t workout, you must keep your diet in check. Sticking to a conventional diet and exercise plan can be difficult. However, there are several proven tips that can help you eat fewer calories with ease. These are effective ways to reduce your weight, as well as to prevent weight gain in the future. Some of the Proven Ways to Lose Weight Without Diet or Exercise. All of them are based on science: Clean Up Your DietYou should eliminate high-calorie, processed foods from your eating plan. Focus on eating fresh, nutritious foods instead. Lean meats, fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should make up the majority of your diet. Not only are they lower in calories, but they are also chock-full of vital nutrients. Chew Thoroughly and Slow DownYour brain needs time to process that you\u2019ve had enough to eat. Chewing your food thoroughly makes you eat more slowly, which is associated with decreased food intake, increased fullness and smaller portion sizes. How quickly you finish your meals may also affect your weight. Fast eaters are also much more likely to be obese. Know How Many Calories You Should be Consuming Each DayCaloric needs differ from person to person. A 1500-calorie a day diet will not work for everyone. Figuring out how many YOU need is vital to your success. We look at several factors when trying to figure out how many calories a person needs each day. Some of these factors include age, weight, height, activity levels, etc\u2026 Figure out exactly How Many Calories YOU Should be Eating Daily to Lose Weight. Use Smaller Plates for Unhealthy FoodsThe typical food plate is larger today than it was a few decades ago. This trend could contribute to weight gain, since using a smaller plate may help you eat less by making portions look larger. On the other hand, a bigger plate can make a serving look smaller, causing you to add more food. You can use this to your advantage by serving healthy food on bigger plates and less healthy food on smaller plates. Increase Your Protein and Fiber IntakeDon\u2019t underestimate the importance of protein and fiber in your diet. Protein maintains and tones muscle, keeps you feeling full (and from overeating,) and boosts your metabolism. Fiber also maintains that full feeling, keeps your metabolism busy, and allows you to have regular bowel movements. The two of these things combined are fat-burning powerhouses! Daily recommendations for protein are to get 1 gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight. For example, if you\u2019re a 150 pound woman, you\u2019ll want to try to eat around 150 grams of protein, each day. The recommended intake for fiber each day is 25 grams, for women. Throw Away the Unhealthy TreatsIf they\u2019re not in the house, you won\u2019t (and can\u2019t) be tempted by them! Personally speaking, I can have all of the resolve in the world to keep my eating on track, but the second I notice the chocolate chips hiding in the back of the pantry it\u2019s like I forget who I am! \u2026True story. Do yourself a favor and clean out the pantry and refrigerator before beginning your new healthy-eating routine. Eat Fiber-Rich FoodsEating fiber-rich foods may increase satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer. Studies also indicate that one type of fiber, viscous fiber, is particularly helpful for weight loss. It increases fullness and reduces food intake. Viscous fiber forms a gel when it comes in contact with water. This gel increases nutrient absorption time and slows down the emptying of your stomach. Viscous fiber is only found in plant foods. Examples include beans, oat cereals, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, oranges and flax seeds. Drink Water RegularlyDrinking water can help you eat less and lose weight, especially if you drink it before a meal. One study in adults found that drinking half a liter (17 ounces) of water about 30 minutes before meals reduced hunger and lessened calorie intake. Participants who drank water before a meal lost 44% more weight over a 12-week period compared to those who did not. If you replace calorie-loaded drinks \u2014 such as soda or juice \u2014 with water, you may experience an even greater effect. Eliminate Sugary DrinksAdded sugar may very well be the single worst ingredient in the diet today. Sugary beverages like soda have been associated with an increased risk of many diseases. It\u2019s very easy to consume excess calories from sugary drinks because liquid calories don\u2019t affect fullness the way solid food does. Staying away from these beverages entirely can provide enormous long-term health benefits. However, note that you should not replace soda with fruit juice, as it can be just as high in sugar. Healthy beverages to drink instead include water, coffee and green tea. Sleep Well and Avoid StressWhen it comes to health, people often neglect sleep and stress. Both, in fact, have powerful effects on your appetite and weight. A lack of sleep may disrupt the appetite-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin. Another hormone, cortisol, becomes elevated when you\u2019re stressed. Having these hormones fluctuate can increase your hunger and cravings for unhealthy food, leading to higher calorie intake. What\u2019s more, chronic sleep deprivation and stress may increase your risk of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Utilizing these tips to lose weight when you can\u2019t work out will help you stay on track to reaching your weight loss goals! Don\u2019t let setbacks set you back! Take control of your life and become the healthiest version of yourself. Many simple lifestyle habits can help you lose weight. Some have nothing to do with conventional diet or exercise plans. You can use smaller plates, eat more slowly, drink water and avoid eating in front of the TV or computer. Prioritizing foods rich in protein and viscous fiber may also help. However, it\u2019s probably best not to try all these things at once. Experiment with one technique for a while, and if that works well for you then try another one. A few simple changes can have a massive impact on your weight over the long term. Thanks for your upvotes & shares\u2026! ",

Thankfully for him and now you, you don\u2019t need to join a gym to lose weight. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to workout to build up muscles and get your heart rate up but there\u2019s the time issue, I get it. So how to you lose weight without going to the gym? It\u2019s all about how you eat. Keto. Paleo. DASH. Intermittent Fasting. All diets that came out in the last 15 years. All promised to be the best diet ever. All have two things in common. Calorie restriction.Absolutely useless if you can\u2019t stick to them.Calories are the thing to keep track of. Keep calories below your BMR and you will lose weight. The best way to go about this is to focus on one meal at a time. Take breakfast for example. Say your breakfast is a Starbuck Iced Mocha Latte with extra whip cream and a doughnut. You don\u2019t have time to prep a nutritious breakfast because of traffic and the kids. A simple tweak to make is to swap out the Iced Mocha Latte for a Grande Iced Coffee with milk and sugar. You\u2019ll save hundreds of calories each day without really realizing it. Then progress to taking out the doughnut for a Greek Yogurt.  This is a great place to be. This change is sustainable and it gives you a springboard to make better decision in the future. Consistency is what is going to get you results. And to be consistent, you need sustainability and motivation. Aesthetic Physiques ",

            "answer_text": "7 tips for losing weight without exercising:  If you want to lose weight, you need to exercise regularly. But in everyday life between work, household, family, friends and hobbies, we often find little gaps to squeeze in a sports unit. And if we do, then we prefer to use the precious free time to relax. That is why we have collected 10 simple tricks with which you can burn fat, eat fewer calories and boost your metabolism in everyday life. 1. No sugar, no chemicals, no alcohol The tiny sins of everyday life quickly become big chunks in your calorie balance. If you're not doing any sport, you should be particularly consistent when snacking! In general, you should avoid all foods with added sugar. In addition to alcohol, finished products from the supermarket are also a bad idea: they are often high in calories, contain chemical additives and flavor enhancers. 2. Housework Cleaning, tidying up, and renovating will get you moving and burning calories while you do chores. So work up a sweat while vacuuming and washing up, then you will have it behind you sooner. 3. High protein diet Protein will keep you full longer than a diet high in carbohydrates and fat. You get a particularly high amount of protein from lean meat and dairy products, legumes, fish and eggs. Plus point: protein prevents muscle breakdown and ensures that above all the kilos from the fat deposits tumble. Take a look at our delicious recipes with Protein Power! 4. Low carb diet Low carb has been THE diet trend of the last few years, because a reduced carbohydrate intake effectively helps to reduce calories. In addition to the amount, the type of carbohydrates is also of crucial importance: Avoid quickly usable carbohydrates such as sugar and white flour. Instead, rely on complex carbohydrates with a lot of fiber such as whole grain bread, legumes and vegetables in moderation - this will keep you full for a long time. 5. Motivation and discipline If you want to reduce your body weight without doing a lot of exercise, you face a big problem: You can only lose weight with a calorie deficit. With little tricks like climbing stairs, spicy food or little everyday exercises you can increase your energy expenditure a little, but the effect is much smaller than you might think. Eating less is also not a solution, otherwise your body will switch to hunger metabolism at some point and return the favor in good time with the yo-yo effect. Only an extra helping of discipline helps, because every little nutritional sin can otherwise be found on your hips in no time at all. 6. Sleep well Good sleep is a huge help in losing weight. Your body uses the rest time to regenerate - this allows you to give a lot of gas when you are awake and your metabolism runs at full speed. Various studies have shown that lack of sleep affects the feeling of hunger and quickly leads to obesity. 7. Fruits and vegetables Everyone knows that greens are healthy. Fruits and vegetables are natural products, free of additives and rich in vitamins and other important nutrients. Compared to other foods, they are low in calories and should therefore not be missing on your menu if you want to lose weight without exercising. The German Nutrition Society recommends eating 5 small portions of fruit and vegetables every day. By the way: If you normally do without sugar and sweets, then an apple tastes twice as good! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to lose weight without exercising is by counting calories. The type and amount of food we eat determine how many calories we consume. For people on a weight-loss diet, the number of calories in a food is a deciding factor in choosing whether or not to eat it. There are several websites that make calorie counting easy. The one I use is My Fitness Pal https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ To begin you must know how many calories you can consume to remain at your current weight. Recommended calorie intake depends on factors such as age, size, height, sex, lifestyle, and overall general health. You can easily do a Google search to find out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight, however, recommended daily calorie intakes in the US are around 2,500 for men and 2,000 for women. By counting calories and knowing how many calories are in each meal you can then figure out how much food you can eat everyday and not gain weight. If you enjoy eating sausage, biscuit and gravy with pancakes for breakfast, followed by a Big Mac meal for lunch and steak and potatoes for dinner chances are you will easily exceed the amount of recommend calorie intake for your day and you will not lose weight but gain weight instead. Counting calories is not just a matter of what we eat, but how much we burn, too. Below are tips for burning energy and losing weight more effectively. 1. Eat breakfast: A protein and healthy fat breakfast can keep you full for longer and help prevent snacking during the day. 2. Eat regular meals: This can help you burn calories more effectively and helps prevent mindless snacking. 3. Remember your \"five-a-day:\" Fruits and vegetables can be a tasty snack and they can bulk out your meals. They are high in nutrients and fiber and low in calories and fat. A 500-calorie meal consisting of fruits and vegetables has more health benefits and will keep you feeling full for longer than a 500-calorie snack of pop 4. Drink water: It is healthful, has no calories, and can fill you up. Avoid alcohol and sodas as these can easily provide far too many calories. If you crave sweet drinks, choose unsweetened fruit juices, or better still, get a juice maker. 5. Exercise: If you find you enjoy eating like I do, exercise is a great way to allow yourself the guilt-free pleasure of eating more. As an example, if you exercise on an elliptical machine for one hour, you will burn between 900-1000 calories. If you count calories burning that extra 900 calories results in you having that milk shake you so crave. 6. Eat more fiber: Fiber, found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can help you feel full and encourage healthy digestion. 7. Check the label: Some items have hidden fats or sugars. \"Ten percent less fat,\" might not actually mean very much less fat, and it does not necessarily mean that you can eat more of it or that it is really more healthful. If you are counting calories, the label will help you keep track. 8. Use smaller plates: Research indicates that portion sizes have increased over the last 3 decades, and this may contribute to obesity. Using a smaller plate encourages smaller portions. 9. Slow down: Eat slowly and rest between courses or extra servings, as it can take 20 to 30 minutes for your body to realize it feels full. 10. Make a shopping list: Plan a week of healthful meals and snacks, list the ingredients you need, and when you go grocery shopping, stick to it. 11. A little of what you fancy: Banning foods can lead to cravings and bingeing. Spoil yourself occasionally with a favorite treat, but in smaller amounts. 12. Get enough sleep: Sleep loss affects the metabolism, and it has been linked to weight gain. 13. Avoid eating 2 hours before bed: Eating within 2 hours of sleeping can interfere with sleep quality and promote weight gain. 14. Eat a more protein diet and less carbohydrate (carbs) diet Examples of protein include eggs, nuts, poultry, oats, Greek yogurt, milk, lean beef, fish, beans and legumes. Example of carbs would be snacks we love to eat such as potato chips, nuggets, cookies, French fries, sodas, pastries, pancakes, corn syrup, hot dogs and sugary cereals are all bad carbohydrates in disguise. The bottom line is have a plan and stick to it. Start moderately; do not try to limit your daily calorie to 1500 per day. You will most likely end up tired, hungry, and irritable. It is best to also couple your calorie counting with moderate exercise. You will soon learn doing a little bit of exercise allows you to have that piece of cake staring at you from the counter.

            "answer_text": " That\u2019s a great question! You know, exercising is super important. But you shouldn\u2019t exercise to lose weight. Because that\u2019s going to create stress in your body + you won\u2019t see results and you\u2019ll get frustrated. You should exercise because you like it. Even if you start with 10 minutes a day. What exercising does, is that it releases stress, it boosts your dopamine level, and it syncs your bodily functions (breathing, heartbeat, blood flow, etc). And that\u2019s how it helps you lose weight (rather than by burning fat). That being said, I barely exercise, and here\u2019s how I lost weight and how you can too!! (I\u2019ll keep it short so DM me if you want more info, I\u2019ll be glad to answer your questions :) ). Intermittent fasting: great because 1) you burn fat when you\u2019re not eating, 2) it regulates your metabolism, 3) you learn to stop putting things in your mouth all the time (this one was big for me)Don\u2019t eat meat AND carbs at the same time. Because the former needs an acidic environment to be digested while the latter needs an alkaline environment. In other words, eating both in the same meal confuses your body and slows down your digestive system.Try not to eat gluten and sugar more than 20% of the time. Because they mess up your digestive system and your hormone production. And you need those to work well in order to lose weight!! On the other hand, eat foods that heal your guts (search them on Google).Eat intuitively (aka, listen. I have a great \u201cdaily journal\u201d that I used to learn that. I can send it to you if you want.Think and behave like you\u2019ve already lost the weight. This one is the biggest advice I can give you. Basically, your personality drives your choices. And your personality is made of your thoughts, your actions and your feelings. When you start thinking and behaving like you\u2019re already fit, you obviously change your thoughts, but also your feelings (because your mind doesn\u2019t know the difference between your reality and your imagination). After a while, that\u2019s going to impact your actions as well. And then making healthy choices will come naturally to you. Of course that\u2019s a super simplified summary and there\u2019s more to it. But just remember that that\u2019s one way to rewire your brain to think like a fit person\u2019s brain.If you find that you don\u2019t have the \u201cwillpower\u201d to follow this plan, this means you have deeper blocks you gotta work on. To give you an example, I was super addicted to sugar for years, and I had to work on that first. Otherwise I would have never been able to do intermittent fasting and eat intuitively hahah If that\u2019s the case, DM me and I\u2019ll tell you how you can heal your mind to remove those blocks :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to lose weight and keep maintaining it without doing exercise, you should follow easy lifestyle habits. Here are these 5 best easy lifestyle habits which will help you to lose your weight naturally. #1. Live Regularly  You don\u2019t need to starve and you don\u2019t have to exercise, either! An Irregular lifestyle breaks your circadian rhythm and stimulates your appetites so that you feel more hungry even when you are full. Therefore, if you follow a regular eating time and bedtime, you can lose weight naturally by just restoring your circadian rhythm. And don\u2019t give up when you overeat or binge eats every once in a while. Your circadian rhythm might be broken temporarily, but it is easy to get back to your routine again. #2. Drink Water  Having 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day can help you lose weight. Drinking water will boost your body\u2019s metabolism and help you dispose of body waste.

Black Coffee  According to various studies, there are different opinions on whether coffee is good or bad for your diet. Personally, I strongly recommend drinking a cup of black coffee a day for losing weight. However, there are a few things to be careful of.You should drink only one cup of tea or coffee a day. More than two cups can take away moisture from the body.I recommend drinking black coffee in the morning. If you have coffee in the afternoon, it can bother your sleep pattern. You should only drink black coffee by itself without any snacks. #4. Shower  If you take a shower every day, it will help you lose weight too. Surprisingly, taking a shower helps burn calories and the calories that you can burn is higher than you think! And here is another daily tip while taking a shower. I always massage the lymph nodes in my body during a shower. The lymphatic system removes extra fluid and waste from the body. It also plays a role in immune function. The lymph nodes can be found in the neck, underarms, and in the groin. Make sure to press the inguinal lymph nodes 10 times gently. It will improve blood circulation and help release body waste as well.Try to do these things while you take a shower so it does not take time away from your other daily activities. It takes less than 5 mins! #5. Make Sure to Sleep Enough  Have you ever heard that you can lose weight while you sleep? A study found that sleeping an additional hour a day will help you lose about 10 pounds a year. Another study found that a lack of sleep will increase ghrelin (an appetite hormone), and decrease leptin (a hunger suppression hormone). Indeed, our body\u2019s metabolism is really active during sleep.When we sleep, our bodies are not just sleeping, they are consuming energy and reorganizing our hormones in our bodies. Also, did you know that diet hormone are produced by your body while you sleep? According to recent studies, the best time to sleep is from 9 PM to 6 AM. If 9 hours sounds too difficult, then try to sleep for at least 7 hours a day. You will experience a weight loss miracle. Personally sleeping has helped me fast up to 14-16 hours every day without any difficulty. ",
