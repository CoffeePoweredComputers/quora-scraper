You can talk to independent bookstores about having a night to talk about your book etc ( I asked few bookstores for my author clients and they do it for free usually) Here in Edinburgh there is an International book festival. Look for something similar in your city. It\u2019s a lot of free promotion for you. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you have some reasonable amount of money for publicity or not. Assuming you have, then you could start using Facebook to publicize by paying it so that they'll advertise about your book. And you could go to book stores and talk to them and strike a deal such that they'd be putting up hoardings outside their shop or so. And you could also maybe consider the idea of sending sms to people about your book. You know the way these corporate companies and all do. By using some bulk messaging thingy. That's all I can think of, right now. All the best. ",
