            "answer_text": "I enjoy both Taleb and Kahneman. The common denominator I see is two brilliant iconoclasts who pioneered their own fields. I don\u2019t think either one is always right, their value is they always have a defensible opinion\u2014not conventional wisdom\u2014that is usually unexpected and always sheds light on an issue even if they\u2019re wrong. If that is what appeals to you about those books, here are some others with similar qualities. I don\u2019t say these people are always right, but they think for themselves and always come up with a useful insight that isn\u2019t likely to occur to others: The Logic Of Failure: Recognizing And Avoiding Error In Complex Situations (9780201479485): Dietrich Dorner: Books Amazon.com: The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference (Cambridge Series on Statistical And Probabilistic Mathematics) (9780521685573): Ian Hacking: Books The Uses of History for Decision-Makers: Richard E.
