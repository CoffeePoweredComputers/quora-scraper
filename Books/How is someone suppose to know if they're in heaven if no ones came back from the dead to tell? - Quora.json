            "answer_text": "First, the Bible gives us no indication whatsoever that God will work in this way and that he will call one of us to heaven and then cause us to return. It is for man to die once and then the resurrection. To allow a man (or a boy) to experience heaven and then to bring him back would not be grace but cruelty. The only biblical example we have of a man being caught up to heaven is Paul and it\u2019s very interesting that he was forbidden to tell anything about it. And the reason he even mentioned this experience was not to offer encouragement that heaven exists, but to serve as a part of his \u201cgospel boasting.\u201d He saw heaven and was told to say nothing about it. This was a unique experience in a unique time and for a unique reason. The second ground refers to the reason each of these authors offers\u2014that through their experience we now find confidence that what God says is true. This kind of proof is exactly the kind of proof we should not need and should not want. Blessed are those who do not see and yet believe. Don Piper insisted that he was called to be the Minister of Hope. If hope is to be found in any person, it will be found in the person of Christ. It is the Spirit working through the Word who will give us confidence in our faith. And what is faith? It is simply believing that what God says in his Word is true. We do not need tales of heaven or stories of those who claim to be there. If you struggle believing what the Bible says, but learn to find security in the testimony of a toddler, well, I feel sorry for you. And I do not mean this in a condescending way. If God\u2019s Word is not sufficient for you, if the testimony of his Spirit, given to believers, is not enough for you, you will not find any true hope in the unproven tales of a child. This hope may last for a moment, but it will not sustain you, i will not bless you, in those times when hope is waning and times are hard. So reject this book. Do not read it. Do not believe it. And do not feel guilty doing so. Heaven Is For Real Tim Challies http://www.challies.com/book-reviews/heaven-is-for-real While I am not the judge of who has really been to Heaven or Hell, I emphatically believe every near-death (or supposed \u201cafter-death\u201d) experience must be evaluated in light of God\u2019s Word. Where the experience contradicts the revealed Word of God, the Word must be accepted over the experience. For the Christian, there simply is no other option. We dare not start basing our beliefs on people\u2019s memories of their personal experiences. I suspect the phenomenal success of Heaven is for Real will tempt people to use their imaginations in telling stories about visiting Heaven. Some will be deceptive, others will exaggerate, still others may take images from a drug-induced state on a hospital bed and by power of suggestion may convince themselves that various images in their heads were actual experiences of Heaven. The financial success of 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real will inevitably invite others to come forward who are willing to either deliberately mislead others or convince themselves of something that was not a true experience of Heaven.   Tim Challies, a good and biblical thinker, has major reservations about Heaven is for Real. Tim calls it like he sees it, and I believe his review is worth reading, especially as a counterbalance to the way so many Christians are quick to believe people\u2019s accounts of after-death experiences.  Tim\u2019s skepticism about the book is more definite than mine is. However, Tim and I are in 100% agreement about the danger of Christians basing any theology on such books, rather than solely on God\u2019s Word. Acts 17:11 tells us that the Bereans searched the Scriptures daily \"to see if what Paul said was true.\" Now, if ever in human history you were going to assume that another person's words were true, not finding it necessary to double-check against the Scriptures, surely it would be with the Apostle Paul. Yet the Bereans were commended for carefully scrutinizing Paul's words in light of Scripture. If Paul's words needed to fall under the judgment of God's Word, obviously mine do, and Don Piper\u2019s do, and Todd and Colton Burpo\u2019s do. I do believe that something is seriously wrong if people take more time to contemplate and discuss Colton Burpo\u2019s account of petting Jesus' rainbow-colored horse, or of Jesus wearing a crown with a pink diamond, than they do studying what the Bible actually says about Heaven. The back cover of the book says \"Heaven Is for Real will forever change the way you think of eternity.\u201d I would say, \u201cSeek to let the Bible alone change the way you think of eternity.\u201d \u201cHeaven Is for Real\u201d, \u201c90 Minutes in Heaven\u201d, and other books about visits to Heaven or Hell By Randy Alcorn http://www.epm.org/blog/2011/May/9/heaven-real-90-minutes-heaven-and-other-books-abou",

            "answer_text": "With the name of Allah who has power of control on creatures and natures.How we can solve the important problems of all human beings in this life and hereafter while the presence of many religions at a time is reason of all wars, illiteracy and poverty directly or indirectly in this life and they are reason for going of a majority in Hell in the life hereafter too? If God is one, universe is one, system of universe is one, Heaven and Hell is one, we all human beings are naturally one, then who divided us in Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Sikhs etc, and who  made us enemies of each others that happened among us wars, killed our millions innocent human brothers and sisters and innocent women and children too? Why we have to spend the half money of world on atom bombs and defense and why we haven\u2019t to spend that money on finishing the illiteracy and poverty from the world? There are many religious books in world like the Torah for Jews, the Bible for Christians, the Veda for Hindus and Holy Quran for Muslims. And there are many religions in world also like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism Atheism etc.  There are Millions differences among their thinking, logic, books, beliefs and life styles. Their all followers claim that they are only the followers of true religion and other all are followers of false, canceled, or incomplete religions. In this situation if a neutral person wants to accept any books or any religions as guidance for finding the right path to the God who created this universe, then it will be very difficult for him to choose any religions and any books from them.  Further there are wars by these religious differences in world since centuries and millions innocent women and children murdered by these wars directly or indirectly. According to my deeply thinking and research these wars are reason for poverty and illiteracy also in 75% human beings in world.  I think if there was any one books and any one religions in whole world, there shouldn't be above important problems for human beings and this world should be like a Paradise, while it is like a Hell at this time. So we 7 Billion human beings should assemble on these three steps.  (1) We should choose 700 expert religious leaders from all religions through United Nations. (2) We should Say them to research and choose any one religion from above religions, because they all say that any one of them is only true surely near  the God who created this universe. (3) Then we all should accept that religion and leave other all religions. Because we all are basically from one father and mother. The God creator is one. The system of this universe is one and the behavior of natures is one too. (4) Without it, we can't establish the peace in world forever, we can\u2019t stop the bomb blast forever, we can\u2019t stop the wars and atomic wars forever, we can\u2019t finish the poverty and illiteracy from the world forever, and we can\u2019t solve the other big and important problems of all human beings too. Because the presence of many religions at a time in world is reason of wars, poverty, illiteracy and destruction of the human beings.  (5) According to my deeply research and thinking the natures like the Earth, the Fire, the Air, the water and the human bodies obeys only God of Islam or true followers of God of Islam. They do not obey another Gods or followers of other Gods. For example, there are hundreds of fresh dead bodies with fresh blood of Muslim Martyrs and saints who are preserved from decay in their graves since centuries and years without used any chemicals. The Holy Quran support this research too.Holy Quran in Surah no 3 verse no 19, about Islam.\"Truly, the (recognized) religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.\" Holy Quran   Surah no 5 verse no 3 about completing Islam.\"Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed my blessing upon you, and chosen Islam as Deen (religion and a way of life) for you\". Holy Quran   Surah no 2 verse no 154, about alive dead bodies of Muslim Martyrs and Muslim saints. \"Do not say of those who are slain in the way of Allah that they are dead. Instead, they are alive, but you do not perceive\"  Holy Quran   Surah no 3 verse no 169, about fresh dead bodies with fresh blood of Muslim Martyrs and Muslim saints.\" Never take those killed in the way of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their lord, well-provided\".Holy Quran, Surah 41, Verse 53, about signs of truth of Islam in dead bodies. We shall (continue to) show them Our evidence in the world and within their souls until it becomes clear that the Quran is the truth. Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord witness all things?So, These fresh dead bodies with fresh blood of Muslim Martyrs and Muslim saints are 100% neutral, natural, perceptible and irrefutable proof  on truth of Islam only.Because there is no any dead bodies of any Atheists and Non-Muslims who is preserved in fresh and sleeping condition with fresh blood like alive person without used any chemicals since the time of last prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ), because they are in painful punishment after their death as the Holy Quran says about it too.Except religion Islam all religions has been cancelled near to the God. Holy Quran in Surah no 3 verse no 85, about all religions except Islam.\"Whoever seeks a faith other than Islam, it will never be acceptable from him, and he, in the hereafter, will among the losers.\"Holy Quran Holy Quran Surah no 2 verses no 161,162 about Atheists and Non-Muslim\u2019s dead bodies and their souls in the life hereafter. \u201cIndeed, those  who disbelieved and died while they were disbelievers, upon them is the curse of Allah, and of angels, and of all human beings together, in a way that they will remain in it forever. Neither the punishment will be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite\". Holy Quran Surah no 3 verse no 91, \u201cThose who disbelieved and die as disbelievers, even an Earth-full of gold shall never be accepted from any of them, even if one were to offer it as ransom. They are the ones for whom there is a painful punishment, and for them there are no helpers\". So, it is 100% proof that all kind of logic, all kind of thinking, all books, beliefs, religions and life styles are incomplete, or cancelled or false since the time of last prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
