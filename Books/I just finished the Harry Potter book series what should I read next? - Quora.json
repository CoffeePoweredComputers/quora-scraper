            "answer_text": "Congrats on finishing the series.Of course, you could read anything after reading the Harry Potter series.You could either read1) Similar books2) Complementary books (1) The Lord of the Rings would be a great place to start. However, be warned; Tolkien\u2019s writing is a lot more complex and deep than Rowling\u2019s. Really enjoying LOTR is also contingent on your taking the pains to read the appendices, and other works of his like The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and so on. This gamut of books will immerse you in Middle Earth. I would also suggest reading The Inheritance Trilogy, and the Star Wars series of books (yes, it\u2019s great!). All of these have one thing in common; they are shamelessly idealistic; epic heroic sagas with generally happy endings.For a different taste, you can try reading Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, a brilliant piece of work, which will give you context to many contemporary Goth-based movies and novels.(2) Complementary books would be Fantastic Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and other works by Rowling intended to support the main canon. If you are interested in witch lore, you can also read books on the Salem Witch Trials, or Quidditch Through The Ages. The reason I haven\u2019t mentioned the Percy Jackson series in either of these is because I personally feel it does not match up to the standards of the works I\u2019ve mentioned. However, as the product of a teeny-bopper fantasy genre that\u2019s tolerated the likes of R.L. Stine, it\u2019s a passable read. ",

            "answer_text": "If you enjoyed reading Harry Potter, then I assume that you are interested in reading Fantasy Fiction i.e. a book genre about a world with fictional characters such as men, wizards, fairies, elfs, dwarfs, etc. There are many good novels in this particular genre, but I\u2019ll just list down a few that I\u2019ve found out to be great reads: (1) Artemis Fowl Series by Eoin Colfer.Though Artemis Fowl wasn\u2019t as big a commercial success as J.K.Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter, its a really good fiction series, especially if you like magic intertwined with technology. As Rowling makes great use of magic, wizards, elves and goblins to build her fantasy world, Colfer builds a great fictional universe composed of the fairy underground where the protagonist is a child prodigy called Artemis Fowl, a twelve year old genius who\u2019s life integrates with that of the fairy folk\u2019s as the tale unfolds.  Image Source: Wikipedia There have been many attempts to make a movie adaptation of this book too, but none have been successful yet. But after many years of wait, a movie release looks likely by August 2019. (2) Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is as much a success as Harry Potter, at least by popularity measure, if not commercially. In fact, if you read LOTR (which by the way was written in 1937, much before Rowling wrote HP), you\u2019ll find that Tolkien has crafted a much detailed fictional universe that consists not only of magic, but also stuff like magical races (hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, goblins, wizards, a dark lord, etc.) and even the politics and struggle between them. In fact, you\u2019ll find that a lot of things that Rowling writes is totally inspired by LOTR. LOTR is a trilogy, a three-part series consisting of The Hobbit, The Two Towers and The Return of the King and movie adaptations have been made on all of them. Me telling you anything about the series will be both an injustice to LOTR, and a spoiler in case you choose to read it in future, hence read the series and find it out for yourself!  Image Source: Wikipedia (3) Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis. I haven\u2019t read this yet, but Chronicles of Narina is also a good story book series consisting of seven parts. You\u2019ll enjoy it if you like animals interacting with humans in fictional universe. Chronicles of Narnia features a protagonist like Aslan, the Lion and an antagonist such as the White Witch. Movie adaptations have been made for all parts of this series. ",
