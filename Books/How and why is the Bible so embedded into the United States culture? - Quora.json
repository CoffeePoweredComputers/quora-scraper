            "answer_text": "Many European immigrants of the seventeenth century left Europe because their brand of Christianity was not accepted in their homeland. The Pilgrim fathers had left England and had stayed a while in the Republic of the Seven United Provinces. The Republic followed a rather strict Calvinistic form of protestantism. The Pilgrim fathers found these Calvinists not strict enough. They did not kill the Catholics, welcomed Jews. So they left for America. There is still a small monument in Rotterdam where the Pilgrim fathers sailed away. These Puritans are part of the base of the American \u201cchristian\u201d culture. ",
