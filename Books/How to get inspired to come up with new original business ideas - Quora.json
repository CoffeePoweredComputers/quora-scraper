            "answer_text": "The best startup to invest in these days are to buy a franchise, franchises come with tried-and-true systems and processes, a host of resources and training, and the support you need to get started. Instead of having to spend your time on trial and error, you can launch a successful business immediately, knowing the costs, high seasons and potential challenges up front. Regardless of whether you invest in multiple locations of the same franchise or choose to own different franchises, you\u2019ll be able to serve more customers by having more than one franchise location. If you\u2019ve gone through the work of creating a great reputation for customer service, it will be even easier to get customers at your new location. You can capitalize on the positive reviews and satisfied customers you\u2019ve acquired at the first location to help launch additional locations. Faster and more cost effective scaling. Replicating of a tried and tested model negates the start-up risk. Effective involvement of local entities. The local know-how and connections of franchisees can be used effectively while the franchisee may benefit from franchisor involvement in national marketing and fundraising. Improvement through systematic transfer of know-how and ongoing learning. Similar to commercial franchises, franchises gain access to an operations manual and also communicate their learning to the rest of the network. Monitoring and evaluation through standardization of practices. Standardisation contributes to delivery of similar quality across the network and will enhance the reputation of the brand and ease of Monitoring and Evaluation. More effective use of resources, Economy of scale can be achieved through collective purchasing and collective marketing efforts.

            "answer_text": "LISTEN Best ways to think of new ideas to help others get what they want is to listen to them. Make sure to always write it down. James Altucher uses restaurant server writing pads to come up with 10 new ideas each day. I use letter envelopes. He had just lost all his money and business and came up with the idea to use them as a means to write down all the ideas that he had for business. This way if he was ever in the situation again he could always refer to the pads. Just observe your surroundings constantly. I've personally grown my business by listening to my customer and filling their demands. It really isn't hard to do though it takes much persistence and a desire to launch. You can also take something and improve it. One example would be Starbucks. They took the everyday $1 cup of coffee and turned it into an empire where people on average spend $5 for a coffee. It's become a complete movement, a way of our society. Try taking something that you're already doing and know well and expand on it. Make it bigger! When that happens you have a bigger business and adding people to support your bigger idea! ",

            "answer_text": "Find a problem that frustrates you and think of 10 ideas on how to solve it. For example, you notice how your school\u2019s parking garage never has any parking. You waste time going up and down the garage only to leave the parking structure to find a space elsewhere. How can you fix that? With technology that can let people know how many spaces are left on that floor?With an iPhone app that allows you to see the map view of the garage in real time?With crossing guards that direct students to their proper spots?The opportunities are endless. The point is to generate as many ideas as possible, you only need 1 to be successful. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "In my case it was simple: Developing/building racing engines was something that I really enjoyed doing. I had been \"playing\" with engines/performance cars, off and on most of my teen and adult life (as a hobby) and had been developing and racing my own drag car for the previous 10 years. Also, I was able to do it out of my own home and garage so I didn't have to rent any space. So, a prime criteria is to do something you really like to do and are (hopefully) good at. Another criteria would be to find some activity/product that there is a obvious market for (one of the things I did was to design a series of advanced racing roller cam lobes). Just think about that in your spare time. I would suggest, like they say so often in the movies: \"Don't give up your day job\" until your sure you're ready and have with a good business plan! ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of using just your rational abilities (logical thinking) you could try to integrate your intuition, emotion and sensations in this quest. One psychological method that can be applied (and you will need to read about and practice it until you get good enough) is to use active imagination.  Active imagination is a \u201cmeditation kind of\u201d technique developed by the psychologist Carl Jung. Through it you can access situations, images, narratives that can help you to bring up unconscious elements and make them conscious. So, active imagination can build a bridge between the conscious ego and the creative inner self.  You can focus in your desire to solve a problem and create your own consignia (orientation) or, better yet, to have somebody guiding your way and meditation. The ideal would be to have a person who is proficient in working with active imagination and who can help you to become proficient as well. ",
