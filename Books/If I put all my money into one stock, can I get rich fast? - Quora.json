            "answer_text": "The key word here is \u201ccan\u201d. Is it theoretically possible? Yes. Have some people done it? Yes. Are you statistically likely to win with this method? No. Remember these statistics: About 20% of people beat the S&P500 over a 5 year period2%-5% do it over a 40\u201350 year period. In other words a career in investing.And that is including all investors, such as institutional ones, people with PHDs in finance etc. So very few DIY investors beat the market, let alone \u201cget rich fast\u201d from picking just one stock, in the long-term. In addition to that, there is another issue that few people speak about. Namely, that tiny minority of DIY investors that get rich from picking one stock, often end up losing in the end. The reason? They let the success get to their heads. They become complacent and arrogant. It is human nature to assume that the past will repeat itself. So if they picked Facebook or Netflix, they often sell and try to pick \u201cthe next Facebook or Netflix\u201d. Beginners luck runs out and they often end up losing. I can remember I watched an episode of Dragons Den, which is the UK version of shark tank.  One person came onto the show and he had made a lot of money buying Facebook stock. So why did he need to get the \u201cdragons\u201d to invest in his business idea, if he had bought Facebook stock? The answer is simple. He gambled again after selling his winning Facebook position. He lost most of his gains from Facebook, so needed to get funding for his new business venture. Once a gambler, always a gambler. Most people, however, assume they aren\u2019t gambling. One of the best books written on behaviour finance is this one:  What did the book find? People have selective memory. That doesn\u2019t mean lying, it means they generally kid themselves about past performance. I will give you a simple example. When the researchers asked people how much money they had made, and indeed whether they think they had beaten the market, most people overestimated how well they had done. Most people also assumed that the good pick was all because of their \u201cresearch\u201d, and luck/chance played no part. These participants weren\u2019t lying, as they knew the researchers would fact check if they really had beaten the market.They merely were engaging in wishful thinking. The bigger question to ask is is it worth taking the risk of having a one stock portfolio? Let\u2019s put this another way. 100% of people who have indexed their portfolios have gotten rich slowly if they have stayed the course for decades. In other words, there has been a 100% correlation historically between people investing every month for decades into the indexes, assuming they invest at least a few hundred a month and don\u2019t panic sell during crashes. The Dow was at 66 in 1900, 2,000 in 1990 and 29,000 this year and you have dividends as well. I am not saying that just because markets have performed well over 200 years, they will always do in the future. The past isn\u2019t always a guide for the future. However, considering there is a low-risk way to get rich slowly over time investing, trying to get rich quickly in the hope that you are one of 0.1% of people who achieves that doesn\u2019t make sense. If you are really curious, index 90% of your portfolio and stock pick with 10% of it. We all have the gamblers bone in our body and just \u201cplaying\u201d with 5%-10% of your portfolio can satisfy that irrational urge that we all have inside of us, without destroying our portfolios. If you want to try to get rich more quickly, private business is easier than investing. It is still difficult but not as difficult as investing. The reason is simple. In investing, all the information is available to the public. So you, or I, can\u2019t \u201cout-research the market\u201d . We can\u2019t get any secret information on Facebook\u2019s stock, or Amazon\u2019s. There are billions of people looking at the same information. Hoping that we are the only ones to spot opportunities is like hoping that if we leave our wallets on the floor in London, nobody will see it. It is statistically unlikely to say the least. If we have special and hidden information, that is insider trading and illegal. In private business, it is different. Not all information is publicly available. So if you learn to see the value in information, and move around that information, you have a better chance of making use of it compared to researching public listed stocks.

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2014if you know what you\u2019re buying (but you can also get poor fast). No\u2014if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re buying OR the reason for why you bought the stock doesn\u2019t actually end up working out. Ultimately, this is a question about diversification\u2026  Truth is, diversification dilutes both your gains and your losses. But it also doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t diversify. So when should you put all your money in one stock? Probably never, UNLESS you know that one company like the back of your hand. And by back of your hand, I mean\u2026 you\u2019ve gone through all their earnings reports, talked with all the management, called their suppliers, visited the company, and etc. In order to have the conviction to own just one stock, you need to do the research and understand that company well enough to own just that one stock. Even then, it\u2019s just way too risky. There are some really intelligent and well-researched people in the stock market, and if I don\u2019t have an edge in information, I wouldn\u2019t place all my eggs in one basket. So yes, while it\u2019s possible to become rich owning just one stock, the more important consideration is learning how to construct a portfolio in which you can get rich with limited downside AND be able to sleep at night. And this is where asymmetry comes in\u2026 If you can invest in 5 companies that all have 10x+ potential upside, then you can be wrong on 4 of those companies and still make multiples on your capital. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about constructing a portfolio with asymmetric investment ideas targeting 5\u201310x+ returns, I highly recommend checking out Chris MacIntosh\u2019s work. Chris retired in his late-20s, having made his fortune in asymmetric bets like the New Zealand real estate (64x), last commodities bull market (10x), Bitcoin (20x), and shipping (27x). He now runs a deep value hedge fund called Glenorchy Capital and shares his research with the wider investing community who cannot access his fund.
