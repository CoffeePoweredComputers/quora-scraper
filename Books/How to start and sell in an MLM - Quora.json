            "answer_text": "You shouldn\u2019t just start any mlm, and mlm is only a description of the model of how it expands. You have to find a company and product that you have an emotional attachment, not just because you saw a an mlm plan and think you can make lots of money, you need to believe in the benefits of the product from personal use or someone close to you. Also research the company to make sure it is ethical - on line research with little negativity, in business for over 5 years, growing and strong financially. In summary, if you think what they promote can help a lot of people, then you are not selling but helping them make a good choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Someone in MLM must sponsor you into their business. Most people discover mlm thru a family member, friend or social contact. Most people (96%) fail at mlm. So your wise choice would be to seek out someone who beat the odds and is a in the top 4%. Finding this person might be a touch more difficult than finding a winning slot machine in a Los Vegas casino room.
