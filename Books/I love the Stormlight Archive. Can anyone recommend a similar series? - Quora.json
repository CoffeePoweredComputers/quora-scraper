            "answer_text": "Depends on what you like about it. The series that made me learn about Sanderson in the first place was the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. It has wonderful world-building, and my absolute favourite magic system. However, it\u2019s REALLY long, and some of the later books are a bit slow. I loved the series, though, and have re-read a bunch of the books several times over. Other than that\u2026. well, the Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan is excellent, with a Sanderson-esque magic system(not as good as Sanderson\u2019s, but still well made). This isn\u2019t terribly surprising, as he\u2019s one of Sanderson\u2019s students. The world building and characters are extremely interesting, too, and I love the dichotomy of magic and firearms. Tad Williams is also good. His books are long and slow, but they\u2019ve blown me away as much in terms of a \u201cSanderson Avalanche\u201d as have Sanderson\u2019s. His treatment of magic is on par with Sanderson and Jordan\u2019s, the in the opposite direction: Whereas both Sanderson and Jordan explain their magic systems thoroughly before solving problems with them, Williams leaves magic as an arcane backdrop that is untouched by the protagonists. Of these three, I\u2019d first recommend Williams\u2019 Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series if you like long detailed fantasy, then the Wheel of Time (if you\u2019re willing to invest a ton of time: believe me, though, if you\u2019re a fantasy lover it\u2019s worth it), but if you want something that\u2019s faster paced, go with Powder Mage.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only read the first book in the Stormlight Archive, and I don\u2019t know whether I want to read all the others, since they\u2019re soooo long and complicated, but I\u2019ll try my best to give you recommendations. If you want a series with multiple character\u2019s pov\u2019s that will intertwine at some point, I can really recommend the A Darker Shade of Magic series by V.E. Schwab.  If you don\u2019t mind reading something intended for a younger audience, but nonetheless as beautifully crafted (although it\u2019s not entirely high fantasy), and with a world as rich and fantastical, I would recommend you read the Inkworld trilogy by Cornelia Funke. Now, keep in my mind that this is rather middle grade and it\u2019s neither as dense nor as complicated as Brandon Sanderson.  If you want a high fantasy series that will leave you waiting for the next book even longer than Brandon Sanderson normally does, and that only follows one character\u2019s point of view, but feels probably the most like the Stormlight Archive, I would highly recommend The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.
