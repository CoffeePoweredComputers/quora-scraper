            "answer_text": "For getting your Kindle ebooks on to your computer, you just attach your Kindle device to your computer using a USB cable, and copy the books from the Kindle hard drive and paste them on to your computer\u2019s hard drive. However, the file format of Kindle ebooks, .azw, can only be opened through Kindle applications - be it on a smartphone, tablet or computer. For downloading the Kindle application for computers, click on this link - https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp - and click on \u2018Download for PC and Mac\u2019. Log in using your Amazon account and sync your Kindle account on your computer. If you want to read the Kindle files on any of the several ebooks reader softwares available for computers, you need to convert the Kindle files to some other file system, like .epub, or others. However, the formatting in that case can get a bit haywire; for example, the paragraphs can come together, or some other problem. Hence, it\u2019s best to read Kindle files on Kindle applications. If you still want to convert Kindle files to other formats, google something like this: \u2018convert kindle files to others formats\u2019, and select from any of the search results. As an example, click here - How to convert Kindle AZW MOBI AZW3 to EPUB/PDF/RTF/TXT format? - and click on \u2018Download for Windows\u2019 or \u2018Download for Mac\u2019 to download the relevant converter software.
