            "answer_text": "Well,here's an answer requested to average scorer,i got 67% in my 1st proff,so read at your own risk\ud83d\ude02But Still i guess I can answer the request based on my experience Disclaimer-: I completely believe in concept based learning whole of the year, and hacks mentioned below are exclusively for exam purpose,don't relate it to learning you get whole year. Scoring depends on presentation of exam to examiner in best possible way,Presentation matters more than concepts in theory exam,so For Anatomy Diagram practice is crucial part as this is what is to be presented on sheet,You'll study whole lot during preparation,but within those 3 hrs limited time,Diagrams are most feasible way to tell what you know,so start practicing diagrams again and again so get a hand over it and can quickly reproduce them( Quick is important)Color your diagrams to make them look more attractive and beautiful and label each and everything so that there is no need of writing the theory part,if time permits as in my case just write highlights,I'll explain with example(you'll be in dilemma that I'm not writing anything will i get marks,you surely will\ud83d\udc4d)Eg.You got a question on cubital fossa First draw this  LABEL it properly,then write CLINICAL and write frw lines on it like you can write about drawing blood from median cubital vein and draw this diagram  (Draw vein though not shown here) And we are advised like 1mark-1 diagram 2marks-2 diagrams 3marks - 3 diagrams(one clinical if possible) 4marks-4 diagrams(one clinical) 3.And the only thing you've to write in exams is Clinical anatomy part Learn the important ones thoroughly,as they can be directly asked(erb's palsy,trendelenburg's test etc.),and some part of each section,because you've only this to write. For histology,look what's asked in last 10 yrs,don't boggle your mind with every thing,you'll not be able to give even half and hour to histology one day before exam,just be selective.Simple questions are asked generally(like histo of liver etc. Which we know in daily routine)General anatomy part is cakewalk,very selective,not more than 10 topics arr to be covered,didn't need much time,look at 10 yrs.For embryology sam applies,10 years are more than enough,but i would advise to study general embryology fully atleast because it will help you in understanding what's written in furthur text and it will be easy to recall,for other specific organs study 10 years.For Practical,(not considering lockdown part here,you'll be able to do it ones colleges reopen),Dissections whole of year,discussing,explaining colleagues is only way to learn and retain.Look for netter's for help and recognize important ladmarks of every organ,muscle or bone,this just comes by practice.Same applies for spotting part.Histology practicals,you'll be able to identify half if you've looked whole year in microscope,everyone knows here how rest half goes ! Look up at embryology specimens,actually these should be supplemented with your theory,those 3D models are Amazing way to understand,mostly the heart,aortic arches,Gut and it's rotation,face are most asked parts,rarely cns specimens are asked(depends on student\ud83d\ude1b) For Answering good in vivas look up at my answer.Akshit Dua's answer to What are some tips for 1st year MBBS vivas? For Physiology Have notes if you've read from guyton but if from books like indu khurana aur ak jain ,these itself are notes,Ak jain is most concise and present you with flow charts which are only key in exams,read and revise flow charts of mechanisms frequently,will be easier once you've good concepts.CNS is most time consuming part,covers almost half volumes of indian book,better be selective for preparation,you can't rad whole of it and i bet will not be able to revise even 100% of selective things,so don't waste so much time on it.Chapters like Blood,Respiratory,cardiovascular,renal systems constitute major chunk in questions, read them thoroughly from whatever book you read,understand the mechanisms,graphs in respiration especially,Cardiovascular physio understanding will constitute 75% of your understanding in practicals,so nothing to skip about.Blood overall is important but everything is to be readed in RBC and immunitu especially.GIT,Nerve muscle physiology,Reproductive Half of them you've read before coming to college and extra concepts needs some focus,spend more time on them,like motility and regulation of secretions part in git,NM you've done almost,reproductive read the female reproduction part thourougly, Endocrine is extensive but you know same concepts are rolled again and again,just read selectively,Everything is a flow chart ! Special senses are cakewalk,also need some attention in extra concepts \ud83d\ude02believe me you'll do these chapters in less than 15 minutes,one day before exams.For practicals, as i said all graphs etc. Needs good understanding of CVS and respi (please do graphs properly,will help you in spotting part also),ya there are some other basic experiments from nerve muscle,eye etc. But those need simple understanding,Just be confident while answering the vivas,Rest depends on examiner ! For biochemistry Most neglected subject in 1st year,i guess,but if you've read from starting,you'll not encounter dreadful nights now,So no one will ask you the metabolism cycles to draw them fully etc.Questions are based on clinical and regulation part like they'll not ask you to draw phenylalanine metabolism,you'll be asked about PKU , this is for most part in metabolism but obviously you'll only grasp them once you know cycles,so metabolism needs thorough reading, and for basic chemistry selective reading needed,important ones are asked only.In Molecular biology ,straightway questions on translation,transcription,about telomerases all these process can be asked,from techniques recombinant dna technology,and PCR these are mostly asked ,other newer techniwues are less frequentEnzymes is mostly concept based,you've alredy read some part and to your luck that part is most important,the Inhibition ! It's doable and needs less time,be thorough wigh concepts.Vitamins and minerals require whole lot of mugging up whivh we obviously can't retain,so pick up 10 yrs and do only selective vitamins and minerals and freuently asked deficiency manifestations etc.,need to read it more times than other chapters,easily foregettable.For Practicals, I still laugh at way we mug up how each and every quantity last night only to forget later and then ask from here and there,someone knows somethings\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02,most have chits.Literally you can't remember everything, if we don't remember we knew the procedure,quantities goes on guesses.Even after doing many times you don't get right color for the tests,For this everyone need to know some hacks like we use In heat coagulation test,when we don't get precipitate even after optimum heating,we add acetic acid to it(and some base)\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and to your surprise this acid base rxn ppt. Exactly looked like the coagulation,Voila ! You're done\ud83d\ude02You wouldn't believe we used to add some topfer's reagent to obtain red color in tests like millon's,sakaguchi's tests,and like alpha napthol for orange color\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Surprised haan !Don't worry a bit about bchem practicals,ask these hacks from your immediate senior's \ud83d\ude02they'll advise best to get through, just focus on viva part of practicals and principle behind the tests performed. And last but not the least,you'll be toiling the night before exams having barely 3hrs sleep and still will not feel prepared just an hour before exam,you'llleft out at things,but don't panic,be patient before exam,you'll get through them,everyone faces this in 1st proff and you'll score more than you expect ! All the best for exams ! Thank you :) ",
