            "answer_text": "Averages are misleading because they include extremes: those who read no books and those who read 80+ per year. According to the most recent data I could find (2013), 24% of American adults over the age of 18 do not read any books at all. That is 1 in 4 adults. Even so, the average number of books read per year by all American adults (including those who read none) is 12. Clearly, the top 10\u201325% of readers do a lot to bring this average number up to 12. In statistics, the median figure is usually closer to reality since it helps to eliminate the skewing caused by extremes. The median number of books read by American adults is 5 per year. Here\u2019s the direct quote from Pew Research: Among all American adults, the average (mean) number of books read or listened to in the past year is 12 and the median (midpoint) number is 5\u2013in other words, half of adults read more than 5 books and half read fewer. Neither number is significantly different from previous years. Source: http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/16/a-snapshot-of-reading-in-america-in-2013/ ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue less than one...   According to Nielsen BookScan \u2013 which tracks most bookstore, online, and other retail sales of books (including Amazon.com) \u2013 only 282 million books were sold in 2009 in the U.S. in all adult nonfiction categories combined(Publishers Weekly, January 11, 2010). http://outthinkgroup.com/the-10-awful-truths-about-book-publishing  That is less than one book per person. Ann Kingman says higher but the numbers do not bear that out; I think this is a good exanmple of why polls can be misleading. Agree some people read from libraries (but not many). And agree that the figure above excludes Harry Potter (but adults read that too, so it really ought to be included...)( But some people read more than one book... I expecty a fairly skewed distribution: a lot of people reads none - some people rwad a lot. And the statistics say they purchase less than one book each a year. QED the average American reads less than one book a year ",
