            "answer_text": "No. Like all \u201cstreaming\u201d services, the contents of Amazon\u2019s library is dependent on licenses with publishers, and the contents of your Kindle library is dependent on the contents of Amazon\u2019s library. If Amazon ever goes out of business, or decides that the whole \u201cKindle thing\u201d isn\u2019t worth their time/money anymore, then your Kindle library will disappear, just like happened to Microsoft\u2019s ebook store. Microsoft Is Closing Its Ebook Store and Taking the Books With It In a similar vein, if Amazon loses the license to a book, or determines that the company that listed it through their site doesn\u2019t have the rights to it, they remove it from your Kindle library. Amazon Erases Orwell Books From Kindle Devices They\u2019ve also done this for less noble reasons. Why is Amazon removing Thousands of Kindle eBooks? And of course, there\u2019s always the possibility that Amazon will just take a disliking to you in particular, and delete your account. When this happens, you have no recourse to get it reinstated or retrieve the books that you\u2019ve previously \u201cpurchased\u201d. Amazon wipes customer's Kindle and deletes account with no explanation When you hit the \u201cBuy\u201d button on an ebook, you aren\u2019t buying it. You\u2019re renting it for as long as the company feels like it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, with a caveat. E-ink Kindles retain the content downloaded to them even when you de-register them. So, even if Amazon goes out of business, your content is safe, but will be readable only on device(s) where it has already been downloaded. So, the limit is the life of your Kindle(s). What you are buying is a license, but a perpetual license. So, the publisher cannot (legally) say \u201cNah, we don\u2019t want people to read the title any more. We will revoke their licenses.\u201d (Before anybody jumps in with the \u201c1984 affair\u201d example, that was different: the seller did not hold rights to the particular edition, and, after the uproar, amazon reinstated the licenses although they already reimbursed the buyers.) If you want to be 100% sure, you can back up your content via USB to some permanent storage. Should Amazon go out of business or \u201cthat the whole \u201cKindle thing\u201d isn\u2019t worth their time/money anymore\u201d, to quote Anthony, it is technically almost trivial, and in that situation will be legal, to decrypt your content and use it where you want.
