            "answer_text": "It depends. In my experience with my classmates, age is not a very good indicator of reading level. Last year, when I was 13, I suffered through The Catcher in the Rye, Pride and Prejudice, Candide, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Granted, aside from the median one, they are not particularly difficult. So, I was in the middle of my class. On the other hand, there were children struggling to the Phantom Tollbooth and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. On the opposite hand, there were a few children enjoying their time in the Iliad and The Sound and the Fury. Some genius even managed to get their hands on The Canterbury Tales. My local incarnation of comprehension (who is 15) has managed to become interested in Ulysses and is reading it for entertainment. Such devotion. Beyond the age of 10 or 12, reading level drops any correlations to age and each individual progresses their own as they please. My elder cousin\u2019s, who is 5 years older than me, reading level is lower than mine, but a dear friend of mine, who is my senior by only one year, is the aforementioned maniac who\u2019s enjoying Ulysses. So, if you feel that your reading level is up to it, go for it. If not, then don\u2019t yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Normal? This implies it is something is what everyone else is doing. Most adults haven\u2019t read Jane Eyre. I was about 11 when I read Jane Eyre. I\u2019ve reread it a few times since then. I\u2019ll not say it\u2019s a favourite of mine, but it is worth a read. I\u2019d say that a young person will not necessarily understand all the emotional content of this (or most traditionally adult books), but that\u2019s not a bar to reading it \u2026 they can reread it later and get more out of it then. But is certainly isn\u2019t ABnormal for a youngster to read it. ",
