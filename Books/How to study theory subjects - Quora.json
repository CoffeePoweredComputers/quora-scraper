            "answer_text": "Few techniques to understand theory subjects but it's depending the subject you are studying: Cumulative learning approach: If the subject is lengthy then you can just read the subject in manner that 40% of the portion you can remember by reading it cumulatively. Cumulative reading is the best way to remember the lengthy subjects without go into depth and understanding it in a summarise manner. If you read it in Question And Answer pattern make sure that you can read it in a numerical order, say for an example read Que. 1 with answer (just read), then read Que. 2 with answer and then before switching it to Que. 3, read Que. 1 and 2 with their answers respectively and so the process is going on. Just reading the question more than one times is saving your time to understanding it and this approach helps you to cover the subjects in the manner of learning with only reading it out.Summarise Approach: You can also summarise the length of the paragraphs and convert whole paragraphs into different points: Summarise the content will help you to understand it and moreover it can save you time when you will read it, it is beneficial for the time you have spent while making summary to understand the subject and when you will read the matter which you already have understood it helps you to revising the subject in lesser time. This approach is also called Last Minute Revision and many publications uses this technique while presenting the long paragraphs.Visualise Charts Approach: Make it precise and just visualise the subjects by making charts for easy revision and understanding it, this will help you regarding the manner which you are understanding it. As per human physiology, visual memories are strongest part of our brain, utilise it and make things easier by making flow charts for lengthy procedures and other matters to understand while reading.All the techniques are inter-related above as per your concern, you can use all the techniques simultaneously for preparing the subjects. I have experienced it and this is proven bc tested. You also can summarise the above techniques by naming it Read-Summarise-Revise. Thanks for reading my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "I will give you a very effective method to study theory subjects and by using this method you can finish your work in half the time you take now(If you master this technique you can finish it even earlier). This technique is nothing but a result of modern day researches over \"How brain consumes knowledge?\" Your brain goes through a particular cycle every time it consumes information and if you know this cycle you can feed it better and faster.This technique is a bit unorthodox so it will require 5-6 days of practice hope you are okay with that. So here we go:- (1). Never sit in front of a wall while studying. You should be facing  something open.  (2)Follow SQRRR or SQ3R to read a chapter or whatever you are trying to memorise. SQRRR means Survey,Question,Read ,Recite and Review. (3)Survey: In this step you need to survey the entire chapter thoroughly which includes reading its introduction , summary ,all major and minor headings. This will give your brain an idea about \"what you are actually going to read ?\". (4)Question: After surveying the chapter your brain gets ready to feed knowledge.Now start asking yourself questions (Better to write them down) over headings , sub-headings and other important stuff you found while surveying. (5) Read: It is the most important part of SQRRR .Here you read the chapter and try to answer the questions you just wrote.Always read with finger technique(Finger on the line you study).Start making more questions and answer them. (6) Recite: In this step you need to recall all the major points and questions orally (7) Review: Here you need to recall everything in the chapter and pertain the forgotten key words. NOTE: (1) Try to visualize every thing in your brain as much as possible because brain stores data in form of images and rhythm only. (2) It will be the best If you can meditate before studying . HOPE THAT HELPS ",
