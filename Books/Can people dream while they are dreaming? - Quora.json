            "answer_text": "Yes. I experienced it once when I was a high-school kid. I used to wake up at 6.30 a.m. One fine morning, I hear my mom shouting at me to wake up. I pleaded her to let me sleep for another 5 minutes, but she was still shouting and said that the time was already 7 a.m. and that I was definitely going to miss my school van (which I usually board at 7.30 a.m.). So I quickly got out of the bed and checked the time on the living room clock (because she used to lie about the time so that I would wake up early out of fear). I don't remember what I saw but after looking at the clock I realised I was late and ran to the bathroom. When I tried to open the bathroom door, I suddenly heard a loud thud. I turn around to see my mom closing the balcony door (ours was a flat in the second floor) with a broomstick in her hand. I understood that she had been sweeping the balcony floor and just got inside the house and shut the door. This is when I found something odd, because the door to the balcony was actually in the bedroom where I was sleeping. Just then I had woken up from the bed and crossed the living room on my way to the bathroom. Suddenly my mom looks at me and wishes Good Morning. I couldn't make any sense out of what was happening. I looked around me and only then I realised that I just woke up and was still lying on the bed and what had happened earlier (my mom shouting and me going to the bathroom) was a dream. I couldn't believe it as it was so realistic. I again jumped out of the bed to go to the living room and checked the time and it was 6.15 a.m. My mom followed me into the living room and asked me to not go back and sleep again. Then I go to brush my teeth. And after that, I couldn't find mom anywhere in the house. The next thing I hear is a loud sound and I realise that it was my morning alarm. I collect my phone which was near the bed (yes, I had a separate phone for myself - a tiny, old Nokia with keypad) and stopped the alarm. It was 6.30 a.m. and I woke up from the bed to find mom working in the kitchen. I was startled and could not believe that the second scenario was also a dream. I doubted if I was dreaming again but what convinced me was that I usually wake up to that 6.30 alarm and daily by that time my mom will be cooking. I spent the whole day thinking of this and was thrilled to believe that I had a dream within a dream. That was my first and only experience of such. ",

            "answer_text": "It is indeed possible to have a dream in a dream and within a dream, within a dream. I love sharing about dreams and I talk a lot about this stuff in my blog right here. However, I want to share my story here with you guys, since someone in a lucid dreaming community challenged me to do \u201cInception\u201d and go four layers worth of dreams within dreams. It actually produced quite an awesome dream. They required me to use WILD to induce the dream and also every single dream layer, so here it goes: The moon wipes me out from a LD induced within a LD induced within a LD induced within a LD from WILD. A few seconds later, I had a false awakening in my room. The dream was fuzzy, so I decided to make my dream stable. It was night, and it was beautiful. I felt a flight would be helpful before doing anything, but I just flew into my room to go back to sleep, in my room, to induce the next layer. After a few seconds of flight, the dream was pretty stable, so I decided to lay down in my bed to try to perform WILD within my lucid dream to go into another lucid dream. I laid down in my dream bed and focused I wanted to WILD within the dream to enter another dream. I almost woke up, but I moved my eyes, and the dream became stable again. I attempted a second time, with success and without waking up. I had a False Awakening in a different room. I was in a big house, and my bed also looked different, it was greenish. I did not have any specific feelings, other than my normal feelings from being lucid. I did not feel like I was in a deeper connection with my self. Here I am at the second level of a dream within a dream. The dream was stable, so I attempted a second WILD. Once more, I laid down in my dream-dream bed and felt a shock around my entire dream-dream body.I had another False Awakening inside a pyramid. I was still lucid, and I wondered why the hell I was inside a pyramid. My \"bed\" was the lid of a sarcophagus from some pharaoh who I had no idea who was. My dream was still stable, and I realized I was in the third level. I was asked to do a waking WILD and three WILDS more in the LD, so I had one more to go. I still had the same feeling, control, and personality from previous dreams, with perfect waking recall and also recall from what I have been doing since lucid. I laid down in my dream-dream-dream bed and focused in entering more in-depth into the dream.I had another False Awakening in another room. I checked my hands to make sure I did not blow the progress. My index finger was skinny and long, so I succeeded. I was in the fourth level, completing the challenge. I was still myself, with my same personality and my same dream body. I did not feel more rooted nor connected with myself, I felt like a regular lucid dream.I decided to look for Dreamer, a fellow Oneironaut. I exited my room hoping to find her. Instead, I found someone who was pissed at me for no reason and threatening. I knew he was a dream character and I was aware that my psychic powers were more significant in a dream. I was in a big room, and he started to ask me a lot of questions. A female dream character also began to ask me questions to see what was wrong with me that I did not get along with this jerk. I did not feel like wasting valuable time in the dream.I exited my house, along with a couple more dream characters. It was night, and suddenly the moon turned red and threw a fireball at us. I decided to follow the dream instead of controlling it. I wanted to see where my subconscious was going to take me. Someone told me that I belonged in a different dream, so the moon was going to try to make that happen.The moon obliterated all the Dream Characters that were with me. I saw the moon turning green. When the moon was green, it would poison me. Also, the moon turned blue, if you made eye contact with it, you would become paralyzed. The moon could turn black, and a big whirlwind appeared from it, sucked you into it and brought you to the previous dream. I explored this odd dreamworld while the moon was randomly changing within these colors. Sometimes it turned on its natural color, which made it harmless.I suddenly got to a place where I could see a lot of people. They were for a Nintendo event for some sort. I wondered what my subconscious had for me. I jumped the line, and a guy asked me for my member card. I thought if I opened my wallet, I would pull one, so I did. He also asked me for my ID. I tried to search for my ID while the moon was aiming at me and turned red. I did not want the moon to hit me, so I ran from there. It was crazier than this: However, the red colors were very intense, very bright and then, a cloud of fire approached me. I ran and hid somewhere. All the Dream Characters did not seem to care. I entered a small kiosk; it was not more significant as a voting booth. I realized it was a Gamestop and I could purchase video games swiping my card in a machine. I saw a Bowser, a Mario and Yoshi painted next to the keypad. I wondered what games my subconscious made, but I could hear fire from the moon, so I left.As I was walking, I avoided a fireball in the last second, when I witness the moon turning green and throwing me a cloud of green poison. I saw the cloud of green poison on me, I jumped to hide in a plant, and I could see how the poison killed the plant. I was fine, so I left the place. The moon was white, looking normal. I saw from the far distance the moon changing, but it was not attacking me. I observed how the moon turned black and absorbed someone.I was flying by a lake. I am confident it was the Michigan Lake. It looked like it, like if I was in Chicago. Suddenly, I saw the reflection of the moon in the lake. It was a blue reflection and I looked to the moon. It is impossible for me to imitate what I saw on Photoshop. It was an extremely beautiful and shinny blue. It was bright as light, but it was blue. The color was also semi-transparent. I was amazed for such a beautiful moon my mind created. I wanted to enjoy this moon with Dreamer, so I tried to summon her. While I started thinking about her and staring at such amazing blue moon, I realized I was paralyzed and recalled that eye contact with a blue moon induced paralysis. I tried to regain control of my dream when suddenly, the moon switched to its black, absorption mode.A colossal whirlwind came from the moon and hit me in a split second. I traveled at high speed towards the moon. I wiped out.I had a false awakening in the pyramid, the previous place I was before WILDing to a more profound dream. However, now there were people with me. I entered a chamber and I had my Tarot Deck with me. Someone wanted to see it. She also had a Tarot deck, so I asked to see hers. I tried to channel and ask the Tarot a question, however, I do not recall the question. I cannot remember the first card, but the second one was called, \"Bent Spoon and Fork.\" The image of the card was a lot of bent spoons and forks, bent with psychokinesis. I tried to channel and figure the meaning of the card without realizing that I was looking at the card too much.I had a false awakening in a weird room, a room where I did a WILD on previous dreams. I exited the room, and the quality of the dream was decreasing dramatically. I went to the restroom and tried to make the dream stable.I had another false awakening in my room. I was back in the first level. My dream quality was terrible, and I doubted I would have enough time to meet Dreamer. I felt I was not going to recover the dream at all. I tried to focus on Astral Projection within my lucid dream, but I woke up. And this is it! And here I can share another dream that I found in my dream journal while looking for the one above:  It was a bizarre dream, a mix of astral projection, lucids, non-lucids and waking... I ended up very confused when I woke up for real. I had a False Awakening in a big hotel room; I believe I was in Australia. It was a very long dream, and I lost some of what happened, but a weird wasp stung me and laid some eggs under my skin. Said eggs hatched almost right away and I started to feel very sick. I went to the ER, and they told me I needed surgery. They required total anesthesia, and I was worried because I just ate. I figured I was going to get sick big time once the procedure ended. I realized that I was probably going to astral project due the anesthesia. When they administered it, I passed out and suddenly, found myself floating above my body. I was dreaming of an Astral Projection, but non-lucidly. I was flying around, and I passed out again. I had a series of False Awakenings and falling asleep several times, like a big loop. At some point, I did a Reality Check and realized I was dreaming. Despite being lucid, I was still buying that my physical body was receiving surgery. I was in a big house, and I took a flight to make my dream stable. The sky was clear, and I could see a very bright light. It reminded me of the Bonus task of the month, to visit the ISS and watch a sunrise over our planet. I was standing on the edge of this station, and I could see our planet and a very bright light on the very side. I saw the Sun rising right behind the Earth, and the beams of light from the sun had a few different shades of yellow, white and red. I was happy to accomplish the ToTM Bonus, so I decided to complete some dares; however, I passed out again. I had another FA, I was in a room, and I realized it was not the hospital. I turned lucid and double checked checking my hands. I could hear a lot of noises, like hospital noises although I was outdoors in another dream. I started to worry about the surgery and lost lucidity. I had another few chains of FAs small lucids passing out and more non-lucid dreamlets, all with brief real awakenings (in my real bed) and installing back to dreaming. I had another layer in the same dream where I was projecting myself, and I saw my body, almost wrapped up with the surgery. I had x-ray vision, and I could see how they removed all the parasite eggs from my body. I also saw my stomach, still full of food and I knew I was going to puke everything and feel horrible once I woke up from the surgery. I could touch other people while in this ghost form, and they would feel me, but not see me, I was fooling for a while. I false-awoke in the hospital bed, and I was feeling pretty bad. I passed out. I had another FA in Vegas. I had a short lucid, and I quickly passed out once again to find me in another false awakening. I had then again another FA in my car. I parked in front of a, and my wife was in the passenger seat (I was driving asleep? lol) I turned lucid out of all the nonsense, but my wife told me that I was not dreaming and prevented me from doing a reality check. I knew this was not my wife because we encourage each other to do a RC. Other False Awakening in a room. Another False Awakening in a different room, outside a building at night. There was a car parked, and they asked me if I enjoyed my trip. They caused all of these dreams to happen; it was a company called, \"9 clairvoyants dreaming.\" I woke up for real. I did over 15 different RCs where all gave positives (I was awake...), but still, I felt afraid I would be fooled again. I went to pee and wanted to go back to bed; I knew eventually I would be 100% back in the waking plane. I have a lot more dreams in a dreaming community, and also a lot of stuff about lucid dreaming in my blog. The world of dreams is amazing beyond measure. Nice read every one!!  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and in more than one way.  Looking at dreams as experience, we note that people can (have reported having a) dream about dreaming, and going from one dream to another as dreams unfold.  One might also retain awareness of a dream, pass into another, remember it, and then come back to the other dream.  This would seem like a \"dream within a dream\".  These dreams might come in multiple layers, like in the movie Inception. Unlike in the movie, however, there's probably not any \"time dilation\" effect.     Then, looking at dreams as a neurological process, it's good to remember that the brain is a massively parallel activity.  States of consciousness (waking, dreaming, sleeping) are a misleading model of the brain's functional activity.  The brain is as active during sleep as in the waking state, even though the body is still and muscle actions are suppressed, It is likely that the brain is engaged in multiple dreams simultaneously at any given moment during waking and sleep.  Only some of them come to \"awareness\".   In fact I'd venture to say you are dreaming right now.  The unconscious dreams are part of the \"background\" determining the meaning and experience of what happens in your field of awareness. It's possible that the \"dream within a dream\" effect is the merging of dreams that actually happened more or less simultaneously in the brain. ",

            "answer_text": "The dream-ego, like our waking-ego, appears to be a singular, persisting entity, but as Buddhist Abhidharma psychology insists, our ego (point of view, practically-speaking), arises and perishes every mind-moment. In other words, our moment-to-moment self-awareness is NOT some solid, consistent thing, but is more like a series of single \u2018frames\u2019 in a motion picture. As each frame of a film passes in front of the lamp and lens, the motion gives the illusion of a continuous flow (mind-stream, citta-satana). This illusion is realized during meditative, psychedelic, or dream states of consciousness in which there are periods of thoughtless awareness, including the persistent thought \u2018I.\u2019 What we are, ultimately, is not what we think we are. We are awareness itself, or more accurately, we participate in awareness. The disjointed way that one\u2019s dream-ego can suddenly accept its role in another totally different dream-scene, without confusion of the transition, indicates this moment-to-moment arising of a brand new \u2018I\u2019 in every moment. A dream is not a place, so when you ask \u201ca dream in a dream,\u201d you are really talking transition from \u2018scene-to-scene\u2019 even if it seems to be \u2018nested\u2019 one within another. This particular illusion is popular in TV and movies where someone is deceived into believing that they are awake to reality, but are living in some simulation, often escaping from one \u2018reality\u2019 but finding themselves in another simulation. The Matrix films exemplified this notion, and those films were rife with Buddhist and Gnostic philosophical ideas, which are radical departures from most Western assumptions about how it all is. The overarching question is \u2018what is Ultimately Real?\u2019 So yes, is my answer. I have \u2018woken\u2019 up in as many as five separate dreams, believing I had arrived in waking life. But remember, these are simply moment-to-moment transitions within the dream state of consciousness, not \u2018destinations.\u2019 From certain Buddhist, Hindu, and Gnostic idioms, waking life is another level of dream which we are to be finally awakened from by Enlightenment or Illumination. My dream-ego has experienced meditation, psychedelic tripping, and even the understanding of a major paradox, which unfortunately did not carry over into waking life to the waking-ego. ",

You just need to think more about this subject to be able to really materialize this idea and you need to have control over yourself even while dreaming. Coming to your question that you were not able to distinguish between a dream and reality because while dreaming our brain uses real life instances so we are not able to distinguish between reality and dream. While dreaming it feels that everything was fine only when we wake up that we realise that something was wrong. After seeing the movie Inception I was really into the idea of a dream within a dream and I was able to experience it and as explained in the movie the easiest way to check whether we are in a dream or reality is to think of how we arrived at this place and trust me while dreaming when I thought about how I arrived at the place and I was not able to reason well that how I arrived I realised that I was in a dream and I woke up.

So your subconscious is 'dreaming' or processing 24/7 with more going on in a split second than you can possibly garnish in a lifetime.   There are ways you can actually see your dreams while you are awake and with your eyes open too, if you want to, and if you get yourself into a state to do so.   With lucid dreaming, you can switch dreams whenever you want.  You can wake up, and go back to sleep, picking up where you left off with your dream, and enter say a pet cats dream, while you are dreaming; so the possibilities are only limited by your imagination, and even then, you can learn new things.

In such a situation you can remain focused on a single volume or jump around between. But as it is difficult for our human minds to hold more than one subject at a time, this may appear to be a single \u201csubject\u201d or several \u201csources\u201d depending on our individual interest, concentration and acumen. Normally we will remember this research as a single experience constructed of sequentially related facts focused in some single narrative that holds our attention or satisfies some single personal purpose. On the other hand each individual book may appear as an unrelated engram or as a dream within a dream. The important thing is to always remember that you dreaming in a \u201clibrary\u201d of many options, the source and nature of which I am currently deep in contemplation and study. ",

After a false awakening, subjects often dream they are performing daily morning rituals such as cooking, cleaning and eating. False awakenings, namely those in which one dreams that one has awoken from sleep that featured dreams, take on aspects of a double dream or a dream within a dream. A classic example is the double false awakening of the protagonist in Gogol's Portrait (1835).Source: False awakening - Wikipedia ",
