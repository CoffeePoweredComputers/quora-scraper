            "answer_text": "ALEX AND THE IRONIC GENTLEMAN by Adrienne Kress has a similar madcap whimsy about it, and like ALICE it features a young girl going on an adventure in a strange world and meeting extraordinary people -- including, in this case, harried movie directors, magicians, eccentric hoteliers, pirates, and an Extremely Ginormous Octopus. LARKLIGHT by Philip Reeve is a Victorianesque spacegoing adventure romp which I think also owes a considerable debt to ALICE in some respects. Also highly recommended: Adam Rex's THE TRUE MEANING OF SMEKDAY*, which is one of the most delightful books I have ever read, and also shares ALICE's wry sense of humour and deft but light-handed political and social commentary. Not to mention the absolutely fantastic illustrations (and comics!) by the author. You can find a taster here: 10 Reasons * (soon to be released as the Dreamworks movie HOME, which I fear will not be anywhere near as wonderful as the book.) ",
