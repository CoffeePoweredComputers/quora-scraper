            "answer_text": "What you do with your novel after NaNoWriMo is completely up to you, although they do make support available for writers who are looking to get published. This includes the NaNoWriMo forums themselves, where you can ask questions, get advice and look for published mentors to help you through the writing process. NaNoWriMo itself is not a publisher and isn\u2019t affiliated with any publishing houses so the work of pursuing publication is something that you would have to do yourself. ",
