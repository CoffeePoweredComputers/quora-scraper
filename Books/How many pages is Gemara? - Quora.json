            "answer_text": "There are 2711 double-sided pages in the Vilna (\u201cbrothers and widow Romm\u201d) printing of the Babylonian Talmud, including both Mishna and Gemara. This is today pretty much the standard printing of the Talmud used almost everywhere, though there have been numerous previous printings, the earliest (complete) one dating back to Daniel Bomberg in Italy in 1520\u20133 (which set the layout of pages for all later editions). Earlier editions which are incunabula\u2014printed before 1500\u2014are extant today only in incomplete form. The \u201cDaf Yomi\u201d (literally one daf\u2014two-sided page\u2014a day) schedule for learning the entire Talmud was instituted by a scholar of Lublin, Poland in the 1920s and is followed by tens or even hundreds of thousands of Jews today. It just finished its thirteenth cycle (about seven and a half years long) this past January 2020, immediately beginning its fourteenth cycle the next day. There is also a shorter Palestinian Talmud (of scholars who resided in Eretz Yisrael) that is less authoritative because the final ordering and compilation occurred over a hundred years earlier than the Babylonian one (which reached its final form after 400 C.E.). It is quite important, though (unfortunately) less widely studied than its Babylonian counterpart. ",
