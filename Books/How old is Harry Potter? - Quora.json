            "answer_text": "So Harry James Potter, was born on the 31st July 1980. So when he starts at Hogwarts on the 1st September 1991 he would have been 11 years old. Only a little kid :)  The battle of Hogwarts ended 3rd May 1998, so by the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (excluding the epilogue) he would have been 17.  In the epilogue takes place on the 1st of September 2017. At this date Harry Potter would be 37 years old.  So that means since it is currently 2017 (although not for long) Harry James Potter is 37 years old! But if you are talking about the actor Daniel Radcliffe then it is a totally different story! He was born on the 23rd July 1989. He landed his role as Harry Potter, when he was 11 years old, but he started filming when he was 12.  And while he was in the last movie he was actually 21 years old. This is because of how they split up the movies, and also the time it takes to make sure they get Harry Potter right!  And currently Daniel Radcliffe is 28 years old, and has a very successful career in acting! ",
