            "answer_text": "The way Hogwarts works is that it is a school for secondary education. In the United States, secondary education would comprise of junior high/middle school and (senior) high school. Since Hogwarts is a British school and covers the entirety of secondary education, it doesn't have seniors (in the American high school sense). It just has years one through seven, with the first years starting at eleven and the seventh years finishing school by age eighteen (or seventeen if their birthday is in the summer). There are plenty of examples of students older than fourth-year in the first four books. Percy and Oliver Wood were fifth-year students in the first book. Percy was also mentioned to be a prefect, which for Americans is similar to being appointed hall monitor. Prefects are basically expected to help keep order outside of class, and help new students navigate around the school. The Head Boy and Head Girl are seventh-year students, and they are basically in charge of all the prefects and help the teachers keep order. (At least that's their role at Hogwarts. Head Boys/Girls at Muggle schools may have additional duties, such as being representatives between the students and teachers.) Percy is appointed Head Boy in book three. ",

We also learn that it is Oliver Wood\u2019s last year (as a 7th year). In the 4th book, we learn of Fred and George and their friend Angelina Johnson, all as 6th years and eager to enter the Triwizard cup, even though Angelina is the only one of this Quidditch group old enough. We also learn that Ms. Weasley is mad at Fred and George, as they didn\u2019t get many O.W.L. high grades in their 5th year standardized tests. Does this answer your question? ",
