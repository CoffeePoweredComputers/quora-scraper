            "answer_text": "yes definitely you can..no issues!! i myself used some of the JEE books such as cengage for jee mains and jee advance (physics) and pradeep for jee mains and jee advance (chemistry)..so u can use books of JEE for PHYSICS and CHEMISTRY but rather i would suggest you to consider referring to MTG books and ARIHANT PUBLICATIONS books as well for NEET because that books are very good for medical entrance exams.. MTG fingertips of all PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY and BIOLOGY are also the standard perfect books!! i myself used all this books..and this all are considered best books for cracking national level medical exam i.e NEET and AIPMT as such! FOR LIST OF BOOKS THAT U CAN REFER FOR NEET AS BEING SPECIFIC ~ http://result.gocareer.in/2016/07/which-books-are-best-to-crack-neet-how.html?m=1 But coming back to ur question , if u refer JEE books for NEET..no problem well and good but all u avoid complex problems in physics as it is not usually asked in NEET as it is asked in JEE mains! ALL THE BEST, MATE! CHEERS!!! thanks for A2A :) ",

You will end up putting in more effort, time which you can use to improve biology or improving your theory part. You should instead solve JEE previous year question banks as revision and as 'final level'. ",
