            "answer_text": "Well to be honest, this will take let's say between 6 months to a year. This is because of a number of things: First the forth and back communication between the writer and artist. Sometimes the illustrator is even dealing with an art director from the publishing company. Their job is on the line so they'll want to make sure everything is moving smoothly, by bugging the hell out of the illustrator (in a nice and loving way. LOL). The illustrator would have to do a dummy illustration for the whole book first before it gets approved by whoever hired him or her to do the job. There are many more things that takes the illustrator's time, but these are the big ones. You added more time when saying there would be great details. However, I've see cases where the illustrator was fast enough to complete such a huge task in just a few months. Like 3 to 4 months. This is done because either the artist doesn't have much on his or her schedule, or through experience. The illustrator knows time saving techniques like not focusing too much on the background and stuff like that. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the illustrator and his or her circumstances. When I decided to publish my poem/story A Remarkable Tale from the Land of Podd it was prompted by seeing a very original young man\u2019s art in a local show featuring students who had just graduated. His work seemed to perfectly capture the slightly eccentric feel of the story for me. He was working two jobs and though he offered to do the work for free we were only 1/3 thru the project after a year. I was able to get a grant to compensate him and this incentivized a little quicker turnaround. The images were sensational to me and worth the wait. (This story was approximately 36 pages as opposed to the 22 you asked about.)  Amazon.com: A Remarkable Tale from the Land of Podd (9781500854874): Ed Newman, Ian Welshons: Books ",
