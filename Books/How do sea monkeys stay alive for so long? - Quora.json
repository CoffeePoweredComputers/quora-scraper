            "answer_text": "How long is \u2018so long\u2019? Sea Monkeys are just a variety of brine shrimp. Brine shrimp do not have long lives, but if conditions are good, they constantly birth live baby shrimp, which will replace the adults when they die and increase the population if there\u2019s enough food to keep them going. If conditions are not good, then instead of live babies, Brine shrimp produce a \u2018resting cyst\u2019 which is capable of surviving for years and years, until it finds conditions that suit it for hatching, and then it hatches out a baby brine shrimp.
