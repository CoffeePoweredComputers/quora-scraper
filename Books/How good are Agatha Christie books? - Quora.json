            "answer_text": "I like Oisini Poddar\u2019s answer and will try not to be repetitive. It was interesting reading the comments - Christie will probably seem a bit laborious to some younger readers who might prefer the rocketing along style and very short chapters of writers such as Dan Brown and James Patterson. Here\u2019s why readers should persevere: The story is the thing! Christie\u2019s plots are carefully developed with just enough clues for the reader to work it out if they are paying attention. There is always the challenge of picking the real clues from the many red herrings. The stories are clever, complicated and often set in fascinating places.Poirot and Marple are very different lead characters: Belgian v English; has seen war first hand and has had a successful career as a policeman v always lived in a village as an upper middle class spinster; understands evil from his years as a policeman v understands evils from daily life in the microcosm of the village; uses \u2018 little grey cells\u2019 v seeing patterns and understanding connections in people\u2019s behaviour. They have similarities as well: both elderly, both never married, both respected by the police, both have close friends that provide connections to the crime - relatives nearby that can be visited, friends who can provide introductions, and they both travelled fairly widely. The strength of the characterisation is that we can predict how Poirot and Marple will react in most situations. Many minor characters are stereotypical or one dimensional but this is not unusual nor important as the main characters are so beautifully rounded.Christie has preserved a lost world for us - Britain between the wars. The slow and langourous life in the middle class English village, the disappearing world of servants and large estates, the lives of ex-pats in places like Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries. The attitudes of the time are particularly interesting: the unquestioning acceptance of capital punishment; the snobbery, racism and sexism; the so-called sophistication of smoking; the casual acceptance of colonialism and imperialism; the expectation that archaeologists could plunder the treasures of \u201clesser\u201d countries; the prevalence of the Old Boys system and different treatment in general for the rich and the titled.The perfection of Christie's use of the English language - her grammar and punctuation are wonderful models for all speakers and learners of English. I have found my vocabulary has been greatly expanded over the years through reading older books such as Christie's. My husband is constantly surprised by words that I know when we are doing crosswords together - many, many times the words are ones I\u2019ve remembered from reading Christie books over the last 45 years.Christie\u2019s themes: good must overcome evil; criminals must be brought to justice; the importance and healing power of love and friendship; appreciation of the simple things; respect for ancient civilisations.Finally, Christie is able to laugh at herself through her character Ariadne Oliver who appeared in 7 novels and one short story. Mrs Oliver discusses, in a comical way, her problems with plot development and with her detective.If a reader is finding the pace too slow, at least watch the David Suchet versions of the Poirot stories and the Jean Hickson Miss Marple movies.

            "answer_text": "Well, does it really need an answer as to why Agatha Christie\u2019s books have reached such unimaginable heights of popularity? The simplicity with which she writes allows room for the imagination. The way she weaves the plot, the integrity which all of her characters come with or be it her magical way of story-telling are just enough information as impetus for the brain to begin it's imaginative work with scenery, characters or whodunit solutions. They contain wisdom and wit. They are intriguing and keeps the reader glued till the very end.. And not to forget her creations-Mr. Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Poirot's moustache is as famous as his \"little gray cells\". He has pride is his luscious, waxed black moustache and is always meticulously dressed down to his patent leather shoes.. And Miss Marple isnt much down in the list..It feels so amazing to read about a lady who is handicap but still tracks down each of those criminals who commit those horrendous crimes and leave no stone unturned to not leave a clue behind.. Above all, if you really want to indulge yourself into a good book and long for a great plot which sends chill down your spine, Agatha Christie is your writer.. A Christie loyalist, Oisini ",
