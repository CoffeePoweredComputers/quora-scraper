            "answer_text": "Short answer: a laptop is not completely necessary for college, but I would highly recommend buying one before you begin classes as it makes your life a lot more convenient. Long answer: a laptop is not completely necessary for college as mentioned by another respondent, most colleges/universities have computer labs. In addition, I know some of the libraries on campus loan out laptops to students (like normal books you would find at a library) except for shorter rental periods. This may sound convenient enough and a smart way to save money, but I would not recommend doing so. First off, if you\u2019re using a computer in a library or academic building, your access to that computer is limited by the hours that the specific building is open. Not all buildings and libraries are open 24 hours throughout the entire semester, which makes accessibility a somewhat major issue. In addition, sometimes the software on these computers are outdated and you may not have the proper authorization to download and install updated software which can cause other issues. In addition, it is difficult to study/collaborate with others as many study groups tend to not be located in a library, but rather on various places on/off campus which is impossible to achieve if you are relying on using a computer in a computer lab. Hopefully, this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "That depends. Are you going to a college that requires you take notes, and in that case, can you take those notes on paper? If not, then no, you don't need a laptop. However I would still strongly recommend getting one. And if you're like the vast majority of people, then a pen and a piece of paper simple won't cut it. You don't need an absolute powerhouse of a pc, you could simply get a cheap Chromebook if you don't want to buy a Windows license, or as I personally do, get an old MacBook air, smack an SSD in there and run Linux on it. Simply being able to run certain programs you might need can be a life saver. Depending on what college you're going to, you might end up needing PowerPoint or Excel, and good luck with that on paper. Having a filer manager manage your notes can also truly be a lot more of a life saver that we realize on our day to day lives. ",
