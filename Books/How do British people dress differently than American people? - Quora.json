            "answer_text": "I take this opportunity to share a little of what I\u2019ve learnt from my late mother and her staff over the years. Mum was an haute couture fashion designer who started in the 1950s at Christian Dior\u2019s atelier. Update:\u2014 When you\u2019re reading the below, don\u2019t think of it as a \u201chow-to\u201d for British vs. American looks. It is a \u2018how-to\u2019 but this is just generally about how British vs. Americans tend to compose their looks to help know the differences in how they dress. Before I get started, I must point out a few things:\u2014 The UK and the USA are not monoliths in fashion matters. Fashion differs from city to city in both countries \u2014 though there is a grain of truth that American society as a whole tends to be comparatively more \u2018fixed\u2019 in both fashion tastes and fashion \u2018manoeuverability\u2019 than the UK or anywhere in Europe.The stuff we often come across on this subject \u2014 British vs. American fashion differences \u2014 is usually very, very stereotyped. The stuff that\u2019s written in any fashion-related publication is actually geared for brand publicity to drive sales in some way.Fashion writing not in the above situation tend to be based on their writers\u2019 own personal experiences or observations \u2014 not from actual differences required in a professional design and manufacturing context. VERY GENERALLY SPEAKING If we had to shoehorn things into a monolithic description:\u2014 American fashion tastes tend to be somewhat more staid from the standpoint of British or European fashion tastes.\u2018British\u2019 and \u2018European\u2019 tend to be interchangeable, and both tend to be somewhat more adventurous and individualistic from the standpoint of American tastes.The way Mum explained it was:\u2014 American \u2018fashion\u2019 rides on safety in numbers, which pretty much translates into not sticking out for most ordinary fashion situations.The imagery would be wearing classically cut clothes in traditional clothes in classical colours.British/European \u2018fashion\u2019 rides on \u201cbeing diff\u2019rent\u201d in a well-put-together way and sticking out in a pleasant way for the most number of \u2018onlookers.\u2019The imagery would be wearing a clever combination of blues with one singular item that contrasts with the whole blue set-up. BRITISH STYLE BASICS British fashion has always had the reputation of being \u201cfearless\u201d and British people famed for their individualistic \u2014 sometimes idiosyncratic \u2014 sense of style. The funny thing is that, almost everybody who\u2019s either in the fashion industry or have grown up in both America and UK/Europe tends to say this:\u2014 You\u2019re more able to define what \u2018fashion\u2019 and \u2018style\u2019 might not be only after you\u2019ve come into contact with how North Americans generally dress.This was precisely how I felt when my family relocated from Europe to the USA and then re-relocated back to Europe and the UK. The quintessential British style handiwork is this:\u2014 British styling is never looking too \u2018polished\u2019 \u2014 having an \u201cedge\u201d in an understated way is more important.Of course, a major factor in the British sense of styling is in fact the UK weather. British climate generally allows for the kind of \u201cthrown-on\u201d feel of the so-called \u201cfestival look\u201d for year-round wear \u2014 the look that one is supposed to have going to an open-air music festival in any given place in the UK. The key British style pieces are these:\u2014 Womenswear Floral dress \u2014 and the so-called \u201ctea dress\u201d in retro 1950s styleStriped topShortsTights in various coloursPearlsPlimsollsBoots (ankle and long)RainbootsMenswear Two-piece fitted pinstripe suit with double vents (blue, grey)Dress trousers, close-fittingOne funky-coloured pair of dress trousers or denims for casualwearLace-up shoes (at least one pair in black)Both ScarfTrench coat \u2014 lined or unlinedLong woollen overcoat \u2014 longer than knee-lengthLeather jacket or coatBlazerAnkle bootsThin dress leather gloves in reddish chocolate brownIf we look at those items carefully, it\u2019s just like what Mum said \u2014 you could easily mix and match nearly all of the items and still never be out of place stylewise. The key British/European style shops are these for ordinary people:\u2014 TopshopMiss SelfridgeRiver IslandAll SaintsPrimarkNew LookZaraH&MHow to summarise the British \u2018look\u2019:\u2014 Mixing tailored but simple vintage or retro chic with modern designer pieces \u2014 the kind of style often seen in British actress Carey Mulligan.Eccentric, fun and edgy from mixing refined girly pieces with \u2018tough\u2019 leatherwear in a kind of \u201cfestival-chic\u201d style \u2014 the kind of thing often seen with British writer, TV personality and designer Alexa Chung.Skinny jeans and ballet flats with different layering and mixing of textures and prints, looking like an off-duty model \u2014 in short, Kate Moss most of the time.British style in 5 steps on a budget:\u2014 Layering \u2014 A leather jacket and a blazer are essential for both men and women. The scarf is more than a utility piece to keep you warm \u2014 it\u2019s a layering device. For women, tights are worn all the time.Prepare for rain \u2014 The \u2018look\u2019 has to look like it\u2019s always ready to deal with rain \u2014 which isn\u2019t meteorologically a lot in the UK but feels like that.Edgy pieces \u2014 It\u2019s unnecessary to hit the extreme like wearing leather boots with a lace dress. It can be as simple as a studded bracelet with a prom dress \u2014 or a leather jacket with your \u201ctea dress.\u201d British style after all these years still retain a punk element.Don\u2019t look too \u2018done\u2019 \u2014 \u201cI just threw this on\u201d in a thoughtful way is better than a carefully crafted one. It\u2019s like you\u2019re supposed to be always going to a real music festival \u2014 looking reasonably nice but no need to get formal or worked-up when you\u2019re in a crowd.Fun and bravery \u2014 Keep things simple, but also keep things reasonably individualistic for kicks. Instead of always wearing black tights, sometimes wear loud-print ones.A guy wearing a pair of pink gaberdine trousers with a conservative blazer was Mum\u2019s way of explaining \u2018fun\u2019 and \u2018bravery.\u2019 AMERICAN STYLE BASICS If you ask any garment manufacturer (as opposed to a fashion designer), you\u2019ll get perhaps a more realistic picture that the quintessential American style is much less focused on trends. The quintessential American handiwork is this:\u2014 American style is about comfort and casual-looking. \u2018Comfort\u2019 and \u2018casual\u2019 are the two absolutely overriding things in American clothing culture since as far back as the end of the American Civil War. People in America dress for comfort, not for \u2018impact.\u2019 And it would be better if your comfort doesn\u2019t make you stick out from regular people.Most American girls with any sense of style wear simple pieces with impeccable style \u2014 a simple black tanktop or white T-shirt is made to look more interesting with accessories. In my own direct observation of having partly grown up in the USA, American guys and girls back in the 1960s and \u201970s really knew their jeans and really know how to rock a pair of them. Americans today still can \u2014 just that they don\u2019t quite have the same elan doing it. The key American style pieces are:\u2014 Womenswear Tanktop (blue, black, white, greyish-green)Shorts\u2018Ballet\u2019 slip-ons with practically no heels\u2018All-purpose, all weather\u2019 thigh-length coat (any material and colour)Menswear Sports jacketThree-piece suit with single or double vents in dark grey (essential)Dress trousers, loose fitting (various colours and fabrics)Both HoodiePlaid shirtWhite dress shirtWhite T-shirtJeansShortsFlipflopsSneakers/trainersCowboy boots \u2014 any American can wear this without looking ironicDenim may have French origins (from N\u00eemes in southern France) but it was America that made it into the world\u2019s most culturally powerful fabric in history. The good news is that Americans have a way of wearing jeans that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s a \u201clast resort\u201d \u2014 which, I\u2019m very sorry to say, isn\u2019t the case with a lot of Eastern Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, Middle Easterners and Southern Asians. In my experience, I\u2019ve found that only American women are mostly able to dress up in jeans and a pair of heels for a night out. I\u2019ve also found only American men and women can wear denim shirts and tops without looking like the homeless or a prison uniform. How to summarise the American \u2018look\u2019:\u2014 The \u201cAll-American\u201d look is subtle and polished (i.e. \u2018effortless\u2019) for the particular occasion. Most importantly, it contains almost nil foreign or ethnic elements and unambiguous \u2018gender\u2019 components, according to Mum and her staff. In fashion and styling, North Americans have a lot more one-sidedness in their styling preferences than Europeans do. Americans as a whole have a certain \u2018certainty\u2019 about their worldview and this reflects their quintessential history. Be \u2018noticed\u2019 rather than draw \u2018attention.\u2019Appeal (in very general terms):\u2014 American women will find appeal in men in both American and European styles \u2014 large men preferably in American style and small/skinny men in European style. American women generally prefer men in slightly looser clothes than the typically European \u2018tighter\u2019 tailored fit \u2014 but American women dislike men in loose-fitting T-shirts. Muscle in men is a desirable trait.Appeal (in very general terms):\u2014 American menfolk tends to prefer women mainly in American styles because of the stereotyped perception of \u2018European\u2019 women being \u2018difficult\u2019 \u2014 yet American guys are happy as a clam when their wives and daughters present themselves on important occasions in European tastes. This is borne out repeatedly for decades in garment orders.Simplicity, timelessness and polished using classic pieces \u2014 whether out to the opera house or just walking the dog. For women, the classic pieces show off the figure without being revealing \u2014 kind of what we usually see in Jennifer Aniston. Or Jackie O. at the most sophisticated end. For men, we\u2019re really talking about Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood and James Dean, in that order. Guys, please don\u2019t ask me how to do the \u201cR-N-E-D\u201d look.A laid-back West Coast or Californian casual look that takes some risks (like girly shorts in summer) \u2014 kind of what we see in Whitney Port.Doesn\u2019t try to be a style icon but makes a hard-to-ignore \u2018statement\u2019 in everything worn that you are \u2018The\u2019 All-American Girl/Guy \u2014 perhaps easily understood in the form of Katie Holmes and Robert Redford.Katherine Hepburn, period \u2014 old Hollywood glamour and menswear-inspired style, and the epitome of taking something simple and uneventful like a plain white buttoned-down shirt and wearing an off-white scarf to make the whole thing look amazing. Very few Americans are able to achieve the Hepburn flavour of looks.The key American style shops are these for ordinary people:\u2014 American Eagle OutfittersForever 21Urban OutfittersTargetBanana RepublicThe GapAmerican style in 5 steps on a budget:\u2014 Keep it classic \u2014 Go for simple pieces in plain colours but wear them in unexpected ways.Invest in \u2018your\u2019 key pieces \u2014 The average American man and woman is into having an easy-to-navigate wardrobe with fairly fixed \u2018coordinates.\u2019 There is no overall must-have American \u201ckey pieces\u201d \u2014 the key pieces are those that fits you to make \u201cyou.\u201dFollow just one trend that fits \u2018you\u2019 \u2014 Americans are very comfortable in their own style and generally don\u2019t follow more than two trends. In terms of clothing and fashion, the overriding feature of Americans is \u201cthink inside the box\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t stick out.\u201dSimple, laid-back, and maybe a little cutesy in the right company \u2014 Americans get a lot of flak for having a \u2018boring\u2019 sense of style even in purely technical matters of garment construction. That\u2019s because the American masses generally treat \u201cstyle\u201d as different in meaning from \u201cfashion,\u201d which is true insofar as American society is concerned. Like Mum said, it\u2019s not what you wear \u2014 it\u2019s how you wear it.Out-of-the-box style only for out-of-the-box situations \u2014 American are not adventurous people in many aspects of life, and \u2018fashion\u2019 and \u2018styling\u2019 preferences are a reflection of that trait. The local malls anywhere in the USA sell a largely uninspiring, flavourless array of preppy and plaid \u2014 because people mostly don\u2019t dress beyond that in daily life, unlike the situation in Europe and the UK. But Americans are more willing (with a little persuading) to go full-board \u201cdifferent\u201d for decidedly \u201cexperimental\u201d situations.I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I had learnt from Mum and her esteemed staff. Remember, all the foregoing isn\u2019t abut high fashion but \u2018styling\u2019 for everyday life. ",

            "answer_text": "British people dress more stylish and clothes fit properly. Even if they are poor they have a stigma against scruffiness. Their Asda (Walmart) sells way more stylish George clothes so even less affluent people dress better. I remember being home and the quality in the US for Walmart George products were bad, oversized, unflattering, somewhat gaudy, and forget anything dressy especially for kids. I still wore it because thats all I could afford. Their George is on par and some cases better than JC Penney and Sears. So in a sense cheap stylish clothes is more accessible to them especially in places like Primark. In the US trainers/ tennis shoes, hoodie is a way of life unless you have to get dressed up.The clothes I felt comfortable walking around in, in the US I did not feel comfortable wearing in UK. Simply because I stuck out like a sore thumb. They dress in a more stylish casual way, unless they are teens wearing hoodies and sweats and even they looked properly fitted, and clean, well groomed, nice hair etc. People are well groomed in general of course there are a few who don't but the majority look nice. At night women and men dress well when they head out on the town. I wouldn't be caught dead in a pub wearing a hoodie, and sweats in a pub in UK out in the evening. In America that would be everyone including myself.I could go any place looking like crap to some degree, messy bun, t-shirt, sweat pants in the US and no one really noticed. I have a funny observation. In the US we had TJ Max, this is where my husband would send me to to buy some Polo shirts and we could always find loads for cheap and bring them over to him in England. In the UK they have TK Max (same place) and I've seen one Polo shirt, they are gone off the shelf in seconds. This is because they are more conscientious of name brands. I had no idea what Pandora charms were until I came here. I had little exposure to Lacoste, and other brands I may have heard of but had no idea how popular they are here \u2026Even someone in a council flat still has a Pandora Charm Bracelet. ",
