            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question that hinges on the definition of \u201cesoteric.\u201d If you take esoteric to mean information that is known to just a small group of people then most advanced biological science is esoteric and you could find many books in academic libraries about the subject. If on the other hand, you mean a mystical, occult type of system there are almost certainly many books from earlier times that would meet your needs. Most early biological theories were based on Aristotle and definitely have that type of bend. ",
