For some books (say, technical books), posting a TOC may actually be considered a promotion of the book. A good TOC may provide an incentive to buy the book. On the other hand, if the effect is negative, or if a TOC pretty much summarizes the whole book (seems unlikely), then perhaps it can\u2019t be considered fair use. As usual, if this is important to your business, consult your lawyer. ",
