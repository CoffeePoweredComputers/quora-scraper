            "answer_text": "Technically Groot (MCU) is genderless. He is just a living tree and while voiced initially by Vin Diesel, there is nothing saying he HAS to be a male or even have any gender at all. The same could be said for Rocket (MCU), but his attitude and personality are definitely more masculine, so he most likely is a male raccoon (or rabbit as Thor calls him). If you want to be specific, there was an entire race of androgynous aliens on a Star Trek Next Generation episode. Some of the \u201cdeviants\u201d of the society actually associate with a gender. If caught, they are purged of all gender identity. ",
