            "answer_text": "Sacrilegious: violation or misuse of what is regarded as sacred. Revelation 22:18,19 says, I am bearing witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll; 19 and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take his portion away from the trees of life and out of the holy city, things that are written about in this scroll. Many movie makers seek to sensationalize in order \u201cto sell what the people want \u201c. Take the Ten Commandments. Hollywood has Moses in a romantic relationship with the pharaoh\u2019s wife when he returned to Egypt from being away some forty plus years. There is no record of such an adulterous affair, as Moses was then married to Zipporah with two sons, who came to do God\u2019s will to deliver God\u2019s people from bondage. That was his assignment that God had given him through thorough training given him by God those forty years in Midian. Again, looking back at Revelation 22, there was to be no additions made to prophecies or taken away. Those who did or have done so will be dealt with. So does God believe there has been a violation or misuse of his word the Bible, then yes, they have sacrificed God\u2019s word of authenticity for the sake of their own glory rather than God\u2019s. Revelation 4:11 says, \u201cYou are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.\u201d I hoped this helped.

            "answer_text": "Are bible movie adaptations sacrilegious? Greetings! Thomas Branagan, Thank you for the question. In my personal opinion, it depends on the individual and how his Holy Spirit is using the movie. Is it to hurt them or save them? Before I knew God, Jesus or Holy Spirit I was moved to go see the movie \"Passion of Christ\" in the cinema. It was a very hard movie to watch for me. I had to put my knees up the front seat so I could not see Jesus getting flogged. I was also unable to hold back my tears. Few years after that on my day of redemption / \u2018Fire' I had a choice and I choose Jesus. So the movie actually was one of the tools used by my Holy Spirit to help me when my day of redemption came. I have also learned many things from bible movies. I find that I understand the 'Word' better after seeing it on the screen. Bible movies for me are just giving us thoughts and ideas on how it could have happened and what the bible characters were actually feeling or going through at that time and space. It also gives me a better picture of the environment, culture and times they were in. After that I would research it with my Holy Spirit and find out for myself through thoughts, internet and in the bible if it was correct and acceptable for myself and if I could use it to improve my knowledge of the bible and be stronger in faith. Love, Joy, Peace, ",

            "answer_text": "Most Bible movies are not intended to offend the intended audience. That\u2019s why they are rarely blasphemous (bad) or sacrilegious (worse). The 2014 \u201cNoah\u201d movie was one I heard ministers recommend against on religious grounds. Why? Appropriating a religious story to inject a radical environmentalist message was one thing. The Gnostic message in it, though, resulted in more than one minister calling it sacrilegious and blasphemous. The directors knew that and admitted it, too. \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d has been considered sacrilegious. It doesn\u2019t even link to canon. Main issue for many Christians was the sexual temptation of Christ. On the flipside, \u201cPassion of the Christ\u201d was one ministers recommended because it was not just Biblical but moving. Because it was so good as a story and faithful to canon, it became a blockbuster. \u201cLife of Brian\u201d is definitely blasphemous and such on purpose, as is \u201cDogma\u201d. Then again, these were comedy movies intended to offend unlike \u201cEvan Almighty\u201d, a modern update of \u201cNoah\u201d. Yet I wouldn\u2019t call these Bible adaptations because the sheer purpose of many such works is to attack the faith for the sake of laughs or the audience that wants to mock Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "Only if they attempt to deliberately distort the viewer into believing that the Biblical account is not true. For the most part, big-screen Biblical epics have either been a pretty faithful retelling of some part of the Bible, or a fictional tale (best example: Ben-Hur) set in Biblical times that \u201cfits\u201d the Biblical narrative. The Bible doesn\u2019t give us a lot of detail and almost none of the dialog that would have taken place during the various events in the life of Biblical characters, so the writers would have to fill in some dialog not found in the Bible itself. This might be where your question came from, with movies like \u201cThe Jesus Story\u201d and \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told\u201d that went deep into the lives of many characters besides Jesus. In these cases, they could have become sacrilegious, but didn\u2019t, because even though they used dialog not found in the Bible, nothing in them contradicts the character of the people or the events, etc. There are exceptions to this, of course. The recent movie \u201cNoah\u201d starring Russel Crowe added some events and characteristics to Noah that flat-out lied about what kind of man he was. I would consider it bad enough to dub it as \u201csacrilegious\u201d. There are a few other examples, but like I said, for the most part, movie adaptations of Biblical stories are just fine. ",

A person who wishes only to wholly re-enact a biblical story (without corrupting the biblical message) for educational purpose is not being Sacrilegious. But there are very few instances , if any , that record the Biblical message without bias of some sort of Doctrine, then it becomes a case of what the Apostle Paul calls \u201cAnother Gospel\u201d and the consequences are the same. Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

The evil people of the region storm the ark as the rain begins to fall, whereas Noah and his family were buttoned up in the Ark long before then. Noah\u2019s youngest Japheth, rescues a girl but Noah decrees that God intends to sweep the earth clean. In reality, the Bible account makes it clear that Noah, his sons, and their wives were on the Ark. So was there widespread outrage at the inaccuracies? No. All the outrage was directed against the idea that Mankind was being punished for despoiling the Earth. All kinds of wild inaccuracies were permissible but don\u2019t bring environmentalism into the story. ",

If the scriptwriters and producers are determined to stick to the biblical story-line as accurately as they can, taking into account the contextual settings, then I think the resulting movie is pretty good and it can be entertaining at the same time. I think back to my schooldays when I watched those Charlton Heston movies The Exodus and The Ten Commandments and I would still enjoy watching them 60 years later. They were not entirely accurate, admittedly, but one was left with the impression that the producers respected the source material and gave it their best unbiased effort. So, making a bible-based movie is not sacrilegious if the production is done respectfully. But others, like the more recently released \u2018NOAH\u2019 are pathetic in their inaccurate and bigoted and biased way of presenting the facts as recorded in the bible. I would call such movies sacrilegious. ",

This is false and did not happen and would not have happened because Noah was declared to be a righteous man, which was the very reason he found favor with God to be in that ark and so be saved from the flood, so it would not have been in his righteous nature to go ahead and commit murder, especially of a baby. The movie completely twists the truth, and that is just one example of all the falsehoods found in bible movie adaptations. All bible movie adaptations are essentially evil and should not be watched.

One (of many) definitions of \u201csacrilege\u201d is: \u201can act that destroys, hurts or ruins something sacred. An example of a sacrilegious act is the burning of a cross.\u201d (yourdictionary.com) It should be obvious that this is only a sacrilege in the opinion of someone who holds a cross as a sacred object. Probably no one except a Christian would deem that act a sacrilege. So, a depiction of a biblical story might be viewed as sacrilegious by one who disagreed with the writer/director\u2019s interpretation of the scene(s). Many people found Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d to be highly sacrilegious while others found it deeply moving and spiritually meaningful. Not many Christians would consider the breaking, burning, or disfiguring of a statue of Ganesh as a sacrilege, but my next-door neighbor, who is Hindu, would be appalled at such a sacrilege. So, perhaps sacrilege is in the eye of the beholder. ",

It is hard to see fault with something like that.

In all things there are at least two parties involved. It's not what goes into a man that defiles him but that which comes from his heart. The purest thing touched by the defiled defiles it. The most defiled thing touched by the holy sanctifies it. Satan speaks truth, quote Scriptures, yet he is the Father of Lies, and the Accuser. God was murdered, the ultimate sacrilege, yet Life, even eternal life, springs forth. ",
