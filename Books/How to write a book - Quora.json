            "answer_text": "You\u2019re in luck with this answer (I think). Most authors have bad habits (even no clue) about the mechanics of writing a book. I\u2019m not going to get into the how of writing or what to write \u2014 that\u2019s your responsibility and your expertise. Not to sound immodest, I\u2019ve spent 35+ years in editorial, publishing and printing, and I\u2019ve put together more than 200 books in my career. Now that I\u2019m in financial printing, my work involves me in putting together great big hunks of those things called \u201cIPO prospectuses\u201d for investment bankers worldwide in a space of only 13 weeks at most. Indeed, some prospectuses of 300\u2013400 pages that I\u2019ve printed started from literally two sheets of paper and finished in four weeks. And paid handsomely for them. The following is \u201ctradecraft\u201d \u2014 and money in your pocket \u2014 so I must\u2019ve gone bonkers to write about this. (All images via Quora image search)  THE MECHANISMATA \u201cBegin with the end in mind.\u201d It\u2019s a proverb. It\u2019s good advice. If we don\u2019t have the end in mind, then the end won\u2019t ever be in sight. Avoid starting anything until and unless you have a mental image of what you want as the end product. A lot of authors I\u2019ve worked with over the years have completely FAILED in this part of the mission. They sink straight into the WRITING PART \u2014 and then end up agonising whether to put in this or that chapter, footnotes or endnotes, subheadings, appendices, picture plates and charts, you name it. And then the copyeditor and the author end up being driven up the wall by each other because so many things done had to be ROLLED BACK OR REMOVED.  STARTING POINT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE When you perk up your guts to start doing the writing, the very first step just goes against the grain of everything that you might know about writing \u2014 if you happen to live in the 21st century. Start the 1st Master Draft on paper. Wut? I\u2019m not talking about your outlines and plans. I\u2019m talking about the actual first-ever draft. So there you are with your brand-spanking-new laptop and an unauthorised copy of MS Office \u2014 and this loudmouth is telling you to do it on PAPER first!  FIRST DRAFT IS A MOCKUP When architects and engineers finish the planning and preliminary outlines of their designs, they do a mockup. And professional writers and designers do the same. Build your 1st Draft with placeholder pages first. Use one sheet of paper as a placeholder for every component of your \u2018book.\u2019 The outside front cover gets one sheet. The inside front cover gets one sheet. One sheet for the title page. One for the imprint. One for the foreword. And so on for each chapter, appendix, index, inside back cover, and outside back cover. There! You have your \u2018book\u2019 in skeleton form \u2014 a small pile of around two dozen sheets.  Now hand-write the wretched 1st Draft chapter by chapter. Start with the easy departments first \u2014 that usually means the middle parts of your \u2018story.\u2019 Don\u2019t write the writeups in normal language. Write mainly in \u2018telegramspeak.\u2019 Write in normal language whenever and wherever you need to retain your own preferred phraseology. Insert into the pile every chapter or section you complete or do. The pile builds up every time you write and insert. Then you have a fearsome pile of crappy papers in a very short time. Why not just write the wretched thing on the computer and do printout? You can \u2014 it\u2019s up to you. But I would advise you do the \u2018handjob\u2019 method for the sake of this:\u2014 At the end of your \u2018master\u2019 draft, you have a mostly handwritten draft that could be used as a support or strut that you actually wrote (literally) the thing \u2014 good for copyright proof and a defensible defence against plagiarism accusations. Now do the 2nd Draft on computer. The second draft is where your actual \u201cauthoring\u201d takes place. When you type your handwritten master draft into the computer, I guarantee you\u2019ll find half the stuff you wrote is just pointlessly STUPID and pure DRIVEL. While you\u2019re typing, you\u2019ll realise this or that part could be rewritten, rephrased, redone, re-whatever. Type that revised stuff instead. And carry on. Then do the printouts and repeat the same \u201cpiling\u201d procedure as mentioned before. Store away your first master draft for prosperity (or embarrassment). You now have your complete 2nd Draft in printout form.  Do manual markups on the 2nd Draft. Yes, do hand markups and edits ON the 2nd Draft first. And when you type those in, also do on-the-spot computer edits. Now you print out everything \u2014 this is now your 3rd Draft.  Insert and replace updates, edits, etc, into the 3rd Draft. From the 3rd Draft onwards, every successive \u201cdraft level\u201d pretty much resembles the handiwork in SCREENWRITING \u2014 you insert revised chapters into the pile and store away the old ones. On the COVERSHEET of your draft, you indicate the major revisions done:\u2014 DRAFT LOG 01 Jan 2017 \u2014 Master Draft 20 Jan 2017 \u2014 2nd Draft 23 Jan 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft 14 Feb 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft \u2014 Chapter 7 17 Feb 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft \u2014 Appendix 3 28 Feb 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft \u2014 Appendix 3 (replaced whole) 03 Mar 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft \u2014 Chapter 5 (riders) 04 Mar 2017 \u2014 3rd Draft \u2014 Riders (various chapters) 01 Apr 2017 \u2014 4th Draft 21 May 2017 \u2014 4th Draft \u2014 Foreword by J. Smith (received, input) 22 May 2017 \u2014 4th Draft \u2014 Charts (various chapters) 01 Jun 2017 \u2014 5th Draft 03 Jun 2017 \u2014 5th Draft \u2014 finalised as Manuscript Notice from the above Draft Log that it took our imaginary author a total of 23 weeks \u2014 because he isn\u2019t an investment banker with a $150 million IPO deal as motivator.

            "answer_text": "Whatever your writing goals are, these are the 7 steps you will have to go through to take your book idea and turn it into a professionally written book that\u2019s ready to be published and read by readers all over the world. Step 1. Pre-Writing (Creating Your Book Template) What is pre-writing? It\u2019s basically pre-formatting your book to look like a book in order to prepare it (and you) for success. For example, when I come up with a new book idea, I will take one of my free eBook formatting templates for fiction or nonfiction and create a new document for the book on my computer. You can download my book writing templates for free at Nonfiction and Fiction Ebook Formatting Templates for Kindle Step 2. Planning, Plotting and Outlining Your Book Planning is where you outline the basic ideas and points of your book. You can just write out the words to create a \u201cbook skeleton.\u201d Some people spend a lot of time planning their books. They\u2019ll even write out all the chapter titles on index cards and have sections on each index card for major points or subheadings in each chapter. That\u2019s all fine and dandy, but for me simpler is better (and a whole lot faster). Step 3. Creative Writing It\u2019s all about writing your ideas and thoughts on paper and letting your creativity flow unrestricted with no distractions! Don\u2019t research. Don\u2019t close your writing document. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Don\u2019t try to edit while you type. Don\u2019t worry about spelling. Don\u2019t look at a dictionary. Don\u2019t do anything that distracts you from writing the ideas down as they flow through your mind. Step 4. Revising and Editing Your Manuscript This is where you\u2019ll thoroughly study your manuscript to find and fix any typos, grammatical errors, factual errors and other mistakes. You\u2019ll research any facts or figures you forgot about and insert any hyperlinks and citations that you need for the book. You\u2019ll also want to insert pictures, graphs or any other media type that you\u2019d like to include in the book. Step 5. Getting Feedback on Your Manuscript Crowdsourcing and finding beta readers is a great way to get feedback from other people to help you improve your book. Most authors will give their book manuscript to their wife or family or friends or even a fellow author and have them review it for typos, grammatical errors, fact checking and other recommendations. That\u2019s a wonderful way to get free advice and help on improving your book. Step 6. Professional Editing Once you\u2019ve gone through several rounds of rewriting and revising your book and you\u2019ve gotten feedback from your ideal readers, it\u2019s time to hire a professional editor to help improve your manuscript even more. One of the biggest mistakes new authors make that can end up costing you a lot of money at this stage is sending a first draft to a professional editor. If you send an unedited first draft to a professional editor, they\u2019re going to end up spending so much time on fixing typos, formatting errors, grammatical errors and common mistakes that they won\u2019t be able to do their best work. Step 7. Formatting Your Manuscript Formatting a book manuscript is basically a simple process by which you design your document or book file to be most attractive and useful to your readers.
