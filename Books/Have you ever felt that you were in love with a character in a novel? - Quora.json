            "answer_text": "Yesssssss, sooo many times. i used to read a lot of books and still do; once i was reading a book about this eccentric clown guy who was so cool and magical and COOL you know, like he knew what he was talking about and he was pretty homey\u2014someone i could relate too. On top of that he was supposed to be very good looking and other people couldn\u2019t carry a conversation with him properly cuz he was too smart for them and what he said made sense after you read it like twice. it\u2019s normal to fall in love with a character i guess, i mean, it happens once in a while but i guess you\u2019ll get over it when someone walks into your life in reality.
