            "answer_text": "Have I read anything good recently? You bet I have! When I came upon this question I was thrilled at the opportunity to share some GREAT NEWS with my friends. And with all the other people here who are in love with reading and books. . . . First, some quick background: When I worked part time at Barnes and Noble, our employee discount was 30%, which was increased to 40% during the Christmas season. Sweet! Everyone received books from me including my grandchildren, who were little ones at the time except for my oldest granddaughter. Well, they all got books even before and after I worked there. When my step-grandson Mason was six years old I gave him a hardcover boxed set of the complete Harry Potter books. You know, for when he was old enough to read them. That time came and he completely devoured them. He has since become an avid, eager reader. His mom, my stepdaughter Rachael, gives me credit for that. It's wonderful, but I can't accept all the credit. Great books and great storytelling deserve much of it of course. As does my husband, his Yale educated Grandpa. They've both read Dostoyevsky. Me? I can't even get past the names. Imagine my joy when, about two years ago, Mason announced that he wants to be a writer. He's now 15 and has had some practice. Many essays for school assignments, a few short stories, including one about his parent's divorce. Broke my heart. He often emails them to his Grandpa and me for critique or advice. He's good. He's really, really good. So, the GREAT NEWS? Mason wrote a poem that's going to be published in an anthology of The Live Poet Society of NJ. He's one of only 100 chosen in a NATIONWIDE contest! His beautiful poem was selected and all 100 will be published shortly. The anthology is called American High School: Just Poetry. The talented young poets then go on to compete and one winning student receives five-hundred dollars in scholarship money. They're all winners in my book. Rachael texted me this news yesterday. At the end she said \u201cAll your literary support paid off \u2026\u201d **Sniffle sniffle** I called my grandson to gush. Along with my blubbering congratulations I said \u201cMason, I couldn't be more proud of you. Your mom tells me I had something to do with it, and that makes me happy\". With the slightly cocky swagger that only a 15-year-old boy can produce with his voice, he replied \u201cOh yeah. A hundred percent, Gramma D, a hundred percent, definitely. Yeah. The Harry Potter books. Yeah. Definitely.\u201d It was then that I handed the phone to his Grandpa. I was gonna start blubbering again. He emailed us his poem. That just happens to be the \u201canything good\" I've read recently. It is stunning. Mason James Bryant, my grandson. His name even sounds literary, doesn't it? ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to read carefully and to apply lessons learned to my life - even when those lessons come from a novel. This proved to be the case with Tom Robbins\u2019 Jitterbug Perfume, which I finished about six weeks ago. It would spoil the story if I told you why, but I now own a collection of essential oils, which I use for various fragrance, healing and cosmetic purposes, and am even more respectful of plants. I finished Never Too Late by Stella Atterbury two weeks ago, after reading it for the second time. It is a sort of autobiographical cookbook. Why I love it is firstly because she is a brave lady who jumped into the catering industry in mid-life and whose restaurant was listed in the Good Food Guide despite her lack of previous experience. Secondly, she had an innovative and highly practical approach to cookery. Years ago, when I had several children living at home, her methods enabled me to cope and feed them nutritious food on a tight budget. The recipes seem dated now, but the methods she developed are always applicable to a family or catering business. Atterbury was the person who is responsible for our cookers now having a low setting, and possibly for the whole slow cooker industry as well, although her name is not widely known. The third I have finished in the past month is Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It by Chris Voss, who is a former FBI hostage negotiator. I am still getting used to applying his advice to my everyday conversations. It works. People will tell me all sorts of things. I don\u2019t have to ask what matters to them. They are grateful to be properly heard. Voss\u2019 methods have also helped in areas of my life where reaching an agreement was essential. Books that aren\u2019t good, I rarely finish. Also, \u201cgood\u201d is in the eye of the reader, where books are concerned. ",

Our knowledge has \u201ccursed\u201d us. We have difficulty sharing it with others, because we can\u2019t readily re-create their state of mind.\u201d The above lines are from a very insightful article titled \u2013 \u2018The Curse of Knowledge\u2019 written by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. It was originally published in the December 2006 issue of Harvard Business Review. This article is definitely the best thing read I have read in the recent times. Why did I like it so much? This \u2018curse of knowledge\u2019 that this article talks about is something that is at the root of most of the challenges that we experience in our daily lives with regards to our relationship with others. Most of the issues in our lives occur simply because \u2013 as the article says \u2013 \u2018we have difficulty sharing it with others, because we can\u2019t readily re-create their state of mind\u2019. Although the article speaks in the context of the business world and its \u2018enormous information imbalances\u2019, I find it equally relevant beyond the business world. And how do we overcome this \u2018curse\u2019. The article does offer an interesting method of addressing it. It says: \u201cConcrete language and stories defeat the curse of knowledge\u2026\u201d By the way, aren\u2019t we all trying to do the same on Quora?

Recently I have read: The Fifth Elephant - Terry PratchettThe Swarm - Orson Scott CardThe Rithmatist - Brandon SandersonNow, all three of these authors come in my top five favorite authors, so I knew they\u2019d be good. But still, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn\u2019t expect Brandon\u2019s to be able to write anything as good as Mistborn and Stormlight - because surely one person can\u2019t write too many amazing books! I was wrong. The magic system in The Rithmatist is probably my favorite ever, with geometry and mystery combined in an intriguing combo. The climax was a bit confusing - there were like three - but it was still a beautifully written book. I always seem to forget how good Terry Pratchett is, and The Fifth Elephant continued this trend. It was fantastically moralistic and powerful while still managing to incorporate comedy and a complex (kinda) plot. The Swarm was basically what I expected. OSC is nothing if not consistent. ",

The parents of a sweet six-year-old are using adorable videos of their daughter dancing to help raise awareness about her rare disorder - and the moving and grooving clips have quickly turned the youngster into an online star. But the condition doesn't stop Audrey from dancing, which she does incredibly well to Bruno Mars\u2019 chart-topping hit Uptown Funk in a widely-watched video that her family posted on her Facebook page.  She was also born with a hole in her heart. But despite her hurdles, her father Scott told Daily Mail Online, she has plenty of energy and a positive outlook: 'Audrey is a happy, loving, smart, little girl who loves to dance, listen to music, and collect dolls and stuffed animals. She is incredibly strong and leaves an impression on everyone she meets!'  But Audrey's cute videos don't just bring joy to those who watch them - they also help bring attention to DBA and raise funds for the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation. ",

            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs' last words  He died at the age of 56 years fighting with Pancreatic Cancer and here are his last words on the sick bed: \"I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others\u2019 eyes, my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you. Material things lost can be found; But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost \u2013 \"Life\". When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading \u2013 \"Book of Healthy Life\". Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down. Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends... Treat yourself well. Cherish others. As we grow older, and hence wiser, we slowly realize that wearing a $300 or $30 watch - they both tell the same time... Whether we carry a $300 or $30 wallet/handbag - the amount of money inside is the same; Whether we drive a $150,000 car or a $30,000 car, the road and distance is the same, and we get to the same destination. Whether we drink a bottle of $300 or $10 wine - the hangover is the same; Whether the house we live in is 300 or 3000 sq ft - loneliness is the same. You will realize, your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first or economy class, if the plane goes down - you go down with it... Therefore.. I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, have sung songs with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, .... That is true happiness!! Five Undeniable Facts of Life : 1. Don't educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be Happy. So when they grow up, they will know the value of things not the price. 2. Best awarded words in London ... \"Eat your food as your medicines. Otherwise you have to eat medicines as your food.\" 3. The One who loves you will never leave you for another because even if there are 100 reasons to give up, he or she will find one reason to hold on. 4. There is a big difference between a human being and being human. Only a few really understand it. 5. You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, You have to manage! NOTE: If you just want to Walk Fast, Walk Alone! But if you want to Walk Far, Walk Together! Six Best Doctors in the World 1. Sunlight 2. Rest 3. Exercise 4. Diet 5. Self Confidence and 6. Friends Maintain them in all stages of Life and enjoy a healthy life. Source : FB And Thank you for Reading \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! Mourners: Scum of Shatterdown, by Jade Ripley. This is the review I posted a few different places. Disclosure: I am acquainted with Ripley and we are members of a writers' group together. Mourners is a good novella that should have been a great novel. The plot is, at its core, a love/hate letter to the Pathfinder roleplaying game (and its D&D antecedent), especially the manichaean Good-Evil/Lawful-Chaotic alignment system and the Paladin class. Anastasia (Ana) is a novice paladin sent along with her master to overthrow the Scarlet Princess, who has toppled the lawful government of the city of Shatterdown. They are greeted enthusiastically by the populace, who seem secure and prosperous, and who throw flowers at their feet. Unfortunately, they turn out too loyal to the Princess, Ainsley, and take the paladins prisoner. Shory story shorter, Ana is required to remain in Shatterdown as a member of Ainsley's inner circle, the Scum, given ironic titles: Duke, a drow knight; Contessa, a teen technomagical genius; Margrave, a pirate captain who feeds on fear (and is possibly the most evil character I've seen recently); and Sybil, a healer and the Scum's moderating force. Against her wishes, Ana is given a title too: Bishop. She meets each other Scum in turn, and each, along with Ainsley, assists in her training. She also learns about their personal history and what brought them to be \"evil\", a proces that leads to her questioning the utility of the system. Eventually, as was inevitable in this genre of books, a world-threatening plot is revealed and our heroes and antiheroes are required to sally forth to meet the omnicidal villains. There's also a love story in there. The book is tightly plotted and has some of the more interesting characters I've seen in a while. It avoids all of the worst traps of a first-time writer. No character is perfect (good gods they are not), but nor has Ripley overcorrected and laden them with so many flaws that one wonders why one should care about them. Cause follows effect, which in turn becomes cause; there is no serendipity or eucatastrophe to save the chararacters and they must instead save themselves. There's clearly a living world in his head, but he doesn't try to make the book an atlas. Most importantly for this book, it creates believable \"evil\" characters, people who could easily be the villains of your average fantasy novel or D&D campaign, but also makes it difficult to hate them and easy to root for them. There's no wondering why Ana decides to pitch in with them. Unfortunately, this is really too much to fit into 158 pages. Pacing suffers, with too many timeskips. The descriptions are a bit too spare. I said before that Ripley doesn't try to treat us to a grand tour of his world, but it would be nice to have some set pieces to contribute to themes and atmosphere, as well as to give something more to interact with besides each other. Most of all, while the characters we see are fleshed out, too many interactions\u2014especially, to my mind, Ana's training sessions with Duke\u2014are glossed over and so we don't get to see enough of their relationships' growth. The reader sees why, but not how. (Also, while this won't be an issue for everyone, I found it mildly jarring to spot mechanics from the Pathfinder RPG I'm familiar with. The one exception to this is Sybil's trick to keep our heroes alive during their combat with the archetypal guardian of the underworld; that was just clever. If this doesn't bother you, or you've never played D&D or Pathfinder, this won't be a problem.) Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable read that treats its characters, even\u2014especially\u2014the evil ones, with compassion. While I finished Mourners unsatisfied, I am looking forward to Ripley's next work. And if he happens to return to Mourners and expand it into a novel, I'll be first in line to order it. ",

            "answer_text": "For a girl(especially a middle class one) in Indian society the love and support of none else but parents, specially her father is very crucial. Only her parents can give her the freedom to fly or can tie her in the chains of family reputation. The upbringing is an important factor for every child, but unfortunately, in India, there are different rules and regulations for a boy and a girl. Since childhood, it is fed into their minds that boys can stay out of home till late night but girls can\u2019t do so else the chances of getting raped/molested increases for them. That boys will have the responsibility to earn and girls have the responsibility to stay at home and run the family. Why so? Why this decision needs to be imposed to anyone? Why can\u2019t a boy decide to run the family and a girl decide to earn the bread? Stereotypes and the fear to break them. Most of the parents can\u2019t dare to break these stereotypes and so they keep their children also chained if they wish to fly. But hats off of to the parents who take a bold move for the sake of their children\u2019s future ignoring chaar log kya kahenge. Recently I read following two stories which made me feel that India for sure needs such parents. Because development of a nation begins when it\u2019s citizens are developed. Because development comes from mind not money. Story 1: There was a girl. She was a perfect marriage material and earning a decent amount at an MNC. Still she was not getting married. Why? Because she was the only child of her parents. But that was not a problem for people. The problem was that she wanted to be the support of her parents. Problem was her condition: Either she would give her half salary to her parents post her marriage.Or she would go for a court marriage so that the money her parents had saved for her marriage, could be a support to them after her marriage.And boy, even educated and well qualified people couldn\u2019t understand that much only. Had her parents committed a crime by giving birth to a girl? Or the crime was that they didn\u2019t gave birth to a second child just because they thought of providing a comfortable life to their only child. But for me, great are those parents who raised their only child, and that too girl, with so much love and gave her enough confidence that she can build her own path. Story 2 : There was a boy. Being a boy you have many responsibilities on your shoulders. And this boy was taught being responsible from an age when boys usually remains involved in flings and enjoyment to an extent that they almost ignore their career and keep procrastinating their duties. But his father let him explore things alone. It\u2019s like he had to learn to ride the bicycle. His father just bought the bicycle and handed over the same to him. His father didn\u2019t even give him the false illusion of supporting him from behind when he first sat on it. His father just told him to ride the bicycle. He was afraid of falling down. But his father advised him to get up whenever he falls down and make another attempt. His father was keeping an eye over his actions, the way he was learning to ride the bicycle in spite of falling down multiple times. Yes it was painful to see him falling down and not lending a hand for support but his father knew that lending hand once might make his son dependent over that hand for rest of his life. And that was the path a father chose to teach his son the lesson to live life. P.S\u2192 The upbringing of children is very important in shaping their thoughts, their perception towards life. Although external factors do play an equivalent role but what impact those external factors have on you ultimately depends on what perception you have already developed. It\u2019s like how efficiently you learn sentence formation depends on your knowledge about the alphabets of the language. ",

In the morning , he usually gets up very early and reads the letter while looking at her face in all its peace while sleeping. Recently my friend surprised her when he scribbled something on the letter and kept it besides her. When I asked what was there inside\u2026he told he wrote just two lines Teri likhi harr nazam ki kasam hai mujhko.......tujhse hi toh harr rasam ki kasam hai mujhko\u2026\u2026 He told their love is the most unique love\u2026.they are happier each day \u2026.. and now with COVID 19 they both know exactly what they mean to each other with all their energies and attention now focussed on each other I told him\u2026..keep your life story a secret\u2026..as till the time you are happy nothing else matters \u2026.. may God bless them\u2026.

I had a lot of plans... God: I am sorry but, it\u2019s time to go. Man: What do you have in that suitcase? God: Your belongings. Man: My belongings? You mean my things... Clothes... money... God: Those things were never yours, they belong to the Earth. Man: Is it my memories? God: No. They belong to Time. Man: Is it my talent? God: No. They belong to Circumstance. Man: Is it my friends and family? God: No son. They belong to the Path you travelled. Man: Is it my wife and children? God: No. they belong to your Heart. Man: Then it must be my body? God: No, No... It belongs to Dust. Man: Then surely it must be my Soul! God: You are sadly mistaken son. Your Soul belongs to me. Man, with tears in his eyes and full of fear, took the suitcase from God's hand and opened it... Empty... Heartbroken and tears falling down his cheeks, he asks God... Man: I never owned anything? God: That\u2019s right. You never owned anything. Man: Then? What was mine? God: Your MOMENTS. Every moment you lived was yours. Do Good in every moment Think Good in every moment Thank God for every moment Life is just a Moment. Live it... Love it... Enjoy it...  It is the soul of BHAGVAT GITA  Thanks for scrolling. ",

Their opinions do not matter If you can\u2019t change something, there is no need to worry or get tensed about it. Worry about those things that you can change or make it better. Don\u2019t waste your time, emotions, etc in things you have not control over Be happy. You will then be doing more good to others than being sad and spreading it Don\u2019t dream too big that you can\u2019t achieve and in the end do nothing. We have the tendency of dreaming too much and when we see the reality we do nothing. Instead - do something. Do something for your dream. Do something for someone Help someone and do not expect anything in return. For two reasons - 1. you will feel bad if you do not get what you expected or got something opposite to what you gave - 2. If you are expecting something in return - it is not helping but investing. Fails the whole purpose behind helping Be there in the bad times. Thats when people need people the most. Its okay not to be there in the good times but always be there during the bad time Thanks for reading through. Made me happy as well. :) ",

Wisdom leads to settlements. 2. Intelligence is power of will. Wisdom is power OVER will. 3. Intelligence is heat, it burns. Wisdom is warmth, it comforts. 4. Intelligence is pursuit of knowledge, it tires the seeker. Wisdom is pursuit of truth, it inspires the seeker. 5. Intelligence is holding on. Wisdom is letting go. 6. Intelligence leads you. Wisdom guides you. 7. An intelligent man thinks he knows everything. A wise man knows that there is still something to learn. 8. An intelligent man always tries to prove his point. A wise man knows there really is no point. 9. An intelligent man freely gives unsolicited advice. A wise man keeps his counsel until all options are considered. 10. An intelligent man understands what is being said. A wise man understands what is left unsaid. 11. An intelligent man speaks when he has to say something. A wise man speaks when he has something to say. 12. An intelligent man sees everything as relative. A wise man sees everything as related. 13. An intelligent man tries to control the mass flow. A wise man navigates the mass flow. 14. An intelligent man preaches. A wise man reaches. Intelligence is good but wisdom achieves better results.

I decided to read that book after I learnt that it was Kurt Cobain\u2019s favorite book. The story is about a genius perfumer Jean Baptiste Grenouille who hates human kind, and about his burning desire to create the best scent- a scent that can make the bearer of that scent godlike. I should not tell more about this novel but this 98 page novel is definitely worth your time. It\u2019s nothing like you have ever read before. ",
