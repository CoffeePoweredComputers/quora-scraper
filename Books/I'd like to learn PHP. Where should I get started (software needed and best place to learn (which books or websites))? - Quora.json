            "answer_text": "Before getting started, I recommend reading about virtual environments (Re-introducing Vagrant: The Right Way to Start with PHP) because that's what you should be using to develop apps - an isolated environment for each app, avoiding the downsides of packages like XAMPP, WAMP, etc. Once you're in (the above link should be enough to get you started), pick a project (make something up) and just start working on it - it's the best way to learn, far better than reading books or watching tutorials. Where can you find ideas and specific helper tutorials? As the editor of SitePoint's PHP channel, I can't not recommend SitePoint PHP \u2013 Learn PHP, MySQL, SOAP & more  - we've worked very hard to make it a respectable, valuable resource. You'll find tutorials for a really wide range of topics there. As a beginner, you should also take a look at PHP: The Right Way for general guidelines and links to in-depth resources regarding modern PHP development. ",
