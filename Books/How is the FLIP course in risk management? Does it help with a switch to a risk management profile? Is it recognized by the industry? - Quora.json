            "answer_text": "Personally, I felt it was a waste of money and time. The whole course is just like the summary page at the end of a chapter. Plus, there is no audio to the slides which makes it even more difficult to engage in. Reading everything that too just bullet points is no use for a career switch. Think before you spend your money.
