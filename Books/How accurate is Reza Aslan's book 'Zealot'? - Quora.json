            "answer_text": "Reza is a top scholar in the field of religion. He knows his stuff and cannot be dismissed lightly. But people should know that Reza\u2019s view of the historical Jesus is only one view among several other theories. There are two prominent models: Reza\u2019s Jesus is that of an end-times preacher (aka, apocalyptic and eschatological) who is zealous for the Temple and for Judaism\u2019s independence from Rome. This is actually an older model of the historical Jesus first made popular by Dr.Albert Schweitzer (yes, that Dr. Schweitzer). Reza\u2019s \u201cZealot Jesus\u201d was actually more popular a hundred years ago than it is today.The more popular scholarly view of the historical Jesus is currently that of \u201cJesus the wisdom teacher\u201d. This Jesus may have started out in the \u201cendtimes\u201d tradition from John Baptist\u2019s influence, but instead of warning that the Kingdom of God was coming soon, he preached that the Kingdom had already arrived and was being fulfilled by him and his followers. This view was presented in the 1980\u2019s by Robert Funk, John Dominic Crossan, Markus Borg and other scholars of the \u201cJesus Seminar\u201d.There have been other models of the \u201chistorical Jesus\u201d: Jesus the guerilla revolutionary, Jesus the powerful exorcist, Jesus the charismatic healer, Jesus the prophet of social change, Jesus the Reconstructionist Jew, Jesus the Messianic King, Jesus the Essene, etc. Most of these have come and gone without much proof. The two theories that have solid historical research behind them are the two I\u2019ve enumerated. Reza is trying to bring the older theory back into vogue again. He will make headway with the public, but what Reza has written will likely not sway any of the scholars in the field. ",
