            "answer_text": "Getting the PDF book is going to determine the source. If you need to sign up, it\u2019s likely some kind of copywritten or protected work. There are always ways around that, but they aren\u2019t necessarily legal. If it\u2019s a matter of an app to view the PDF, you can check out Soda PDF. But for the most part you can find PDFs of books by Googling if they are available. Once you download it you can open it. Copywritten work relies on DRM (Digital Rights Management) and often membership areas to acquire the content, appropriately. ",
