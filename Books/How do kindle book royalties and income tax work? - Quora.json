            "answer_text": "You have to give them your TAX ID number. Foreign people have to provide either their country tax ID number or give and oath that their country has no tax ID or withholding. Americans are given a 1099-MISC form if they make more than $10 in royalties (U.S. Law requires this). If you make more than $400 NET PROFIT in book royalties (or combined music and book royalties) in a GIVEN tax year you are REQUIRED to pay 15% Social Security (FICA) tax. You are required to post your NET PROFITS from book royalties on your 1040 Tax Form however you are allowed to write off EXPENSES directly entailed in making that book, such as Copyright fees, Printed Proof costs, editing services, cover services. AFTER you subtract all that from GROSS ROYALTIES what is left is NET ROYALTIES. NET Royalties of $400 or more MUST be reported on 1040 for retired people or those making under minimum for taxes and you must cut them a check for 15% Social Security as \u201cSelf-employment tax.\u201d IF you are required to file a tax return because you make over a certain amount and you have royalties of $10 or more and got a 1099-Form you must include that as part of your GROSS INCOME minus costs involved. If you have NET ROAYTIES in ANY Amount after deducting costs you must file that on a separate page for Rents and Royalties. This is a REQUIREMENT. We failed to do that one year and the IRS sent the return back, so it delayed our getting a REFUND. Sounds silly, but even if it\u2019s $1 in net royalties you need to use that separate form (Schedule E). The IRS gets copies of the 1099 so if you don\u2019t list it, don\u2019t take your deductions for costs and don\u2019t file form E, the IRS would have grounds to audit you. If that happens you can be fined. To avoid the fine you have RE-FILE an AMENDED return with the GROSS Royalties, costs, and form E. ",
