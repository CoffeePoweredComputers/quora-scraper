            "answer_text": "The Bhagavad Gita is a deeply philosophical text which cannot be merely deciphered by translations as then there would appear to the uninitiated many contradictions, that is why commentaries are preferred.  The basic one with meaning and little explanation is the Srimad Bhagavad Gita by Gita Press, Gorakhpur. It is the most popular and widely available. A deeper insight into the Gita is provided by The Holy Geeta by Swami Chinmayananda. This is full of useful examples and illustrations. This is very highly recommended for beginners. Once fairly advanced, you could try Bhagavad Gita with Shankaracharya's Bhashya either by A. G. Warrier or Alladi Mahadeva Sastri. I'd suggest the former for easier language. For commentaries by other schools, you try Ramanujacharya's bhashya by Swami Adidevananda or Madhvacharya's Bhashya by B. N. K. Sharma, maybe even the Bhashya by Abhinavagupta found in the Gita Supersite. My request would be to not read Bhagavad Gita As It Is (Not). It is confusing and alarmingly misinterpreted in places. One must remember that the Gita is a guide and not a rule book. It is our friend which whispers us encouragement, not a commandment damning others. Also if Bhakti is what you seek I doubt anyone can challenge the 3 great Acharyas, with special emphasis on Jnana by Shankaracharya or Prapatti by Ramanujacharya or Bhakti by Madhvacharya.  ",

            "answer_text": "You could try the bhagawad gita by S Radhakrishnan. It has the verses, the translation as well as footnotes and descriptions of the related verses from the Upanisads. Most of the references are the based on Samkara\u2019s commentary or Samkara bhasya on the Bhagawad Gita, Upanisads, and Brahma sutra. I can safely say that the book gives you a holistic perspective without compromising on the essence of each verse. The book by S Radhakrishnan also describes in its introduction the various philosophies and the philosophy the book adopts. The book makes it easy for the reader to contrast with various other interpretations and compares the meaning of verses in the Gita to other translations or verses from other vedic scriptures. I do NOT wish to recommend the Bhagawad Gita As it is by prabhupada because it is written in coherence with the vaishnavism ISKCON preaches. Though nobody alters the verses, the translation, interpretation, and manipulation are written in favour of ISKCON ideology resulting in a skewed perspective. Good luck ! ",
