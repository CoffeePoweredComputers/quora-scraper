I started with Noddy and Big Ears, went on to the Magic Faraway Tree when I was about five, and finished up with the Famous Five and the Secret Seven when I was a little older. I remember for several years I strongly identified with George of the Famous Five. I thought she was wonderful. A couple of years ago, I saw an offer on Amazon Kindle for three of the books and bought them, and went for a stroll down Memory Lane. I couldn\u2019t believe what an objectionable little brat she seems to the adult me. No wonder I was clouted so often when I was a child. They were certainly fun for a kid to read, but I clearly didn\u2019t have much taste. ",

            "answer_text": "Have I ever read Enid Blyton books? When I was 12, my father was transferred to a town near Frankfurt for two years. While there I met the most interesting girl, with a wild imagination. She was from the States, but had lived in Great Britain and was reading a book I hadn\u2019t seen in the US. I think it was a Roald Dahl\u2019s \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d. We discovered we were both bookworms and she invited me to her fancy home where she introduced me to The Famous Five series. I think she had Eight and I borrowed them all. The adventures this crew went on were nothing I had read before and I couldn\u2019t get enough. Through Cindy I also fell in love with Puffin books and even now, I attach a specific and unique scent to those beloved young adult paperbacks. Thanks for asking! I saw this a bit ago and didn\u2019t know where on Quora the question went. I had to answer! Your question brought back the best of memories. ",
