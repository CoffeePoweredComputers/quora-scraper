            "answer_text": "Carefully read The Wall Street Journal, carefully noting the reported developments, then utilizing the services of a proven financial advisor to make investments, balancing roughly 1/2 between no-load mutual funds with proven positive results over time, and 1/2 split evenly between blue chip stocks paying dividend percentages of at least 4.5%, and municipal bonds with double tax exempt dividends (meaning exempt from both federal and state taxes). Using current events to invest, with proper professional advice, is nothing new, but may people either don\u2019t utilize current events for investment, OR, don\u2019t utilize sound professional advice. Now, manage your expectations. A recently published definition of \u201crich\u201d, is having at least $2.3 million in financial assets. It may prove impossible to get there in just two years, but you\u2019ll be well on your way. Getting \u201crich\u201d is not an accident (unless you win a big lottery), but rather, a planned, methodical approach, which also mandates the least possible amount of debt (probably, only a home mortgage).
