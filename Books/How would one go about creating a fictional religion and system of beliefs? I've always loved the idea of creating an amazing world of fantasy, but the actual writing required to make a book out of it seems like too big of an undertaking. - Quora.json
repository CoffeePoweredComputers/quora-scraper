            "answer_text": "The best thing would be to draw from the real world. There's usually a pattern: Our god or gods created us and they are very similar to us in physical form and color. So different cultures will have their own versions.It provides guidance and direction using stories of the ancients which have been instilled as an important part in the cultural moral compass. So it would separate what is considered good from evil.It explains the origins of the culture and answers the big questions such as \"where we came from\", \"how did we get here\", \"who's protecting us\". \"was he a fighter or peacemaker\".Provide a legendary story (or stories) of how the deity battled and triumphed over their adversary, because without and adversary there wouldn't be much point to the religion.Optionally include a savior or a redeemer. The \"chosen one\" who people seem to be expecting to purge the lands from all evil and has come to restore peace throughout the land.So by starting with a religion it will define their beliefs and morals. Maybe they worship the sea or water. Why? Because they suddenly rose from the oceans to take over another island (i.e. Maori tribe in New Zealand - though they don't worship the sea). Maybe they could be like the Mayans where human sacrifice was a required thing that people did to appease their god? Maybe their beliefs are a little 'different' such as the Sambia people where perhaps one of your culture's beliefs don't really gel with another culture's beliefs. I guess the main question is which one religion that you make do you want to be superior? Because you can't have them all getting along happily with similar beliefs, there has to be conflict somewhere. There has to be something where decisions are made either according to or against their beliefs especially when groups of different religions have to work together in your story. If you went easy, you could have just one religion throughout your fictional land, but it wouldn't bring out many cultural differences among themselves to work out. It would be rather simple because you'd have either believers or nonbelievers so that could be your only conflict which rather negates having religion as part of your story in the first place since it's more about characters and their own personal moral code independent of religion.

            "answer_text": "Read:\"Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture\" by Marvin Harris,  \"The Christians as  the Romans Saw Them\"  by Robert Louis Wilken and \"The Serpent and the Rainbow\" by Wade Davis I love SF&F and I study religion so I love it when a SF&F story has something interesting to say about religion.  But I really hate it when they get it wrong.  Things to consider: Religion has less to do with \"sacred texts\" or \"holy teachings\" than it has to do with why things are the way they are, or what people should do to live good lives.  Religion is how people explain their experiences to themselves.  People in a hierarchical society tend to have hierarchical gods.  People in more tribal or egalitarian societies tend to have more tribal or egalitarian gods.  (For a given definition of \"god\").   Religion usually has more to do with culture than with institutions.  Most religions are practiced in the home and lead by the heads of the household.    In tribal cultures many religious specialist do the same sort of work that everyone else does.  They just do the rituals as needed and get compensated by the people requesting the ritual.    Religious institutions (like all institutions) need to have some sort of economic basis in the culture.     There is a tendency to talk about monks and priests without ever thinking about how they pay for their food, housing, and clothing.  The only people who sit around praying all day are wealthy people who can afford to pay for the privilege.   Everyone else has to do some sort of work.   Many religion institutions thrive on patronage.  The long standing relationship between rulers and religious institutions has to do with rulers using religion to justify their power and funneling resources into the religious institutions to get them to support their claims.   Denominations are usually the result of power struggles.  If the religion you invent has denominations that means there has been political conflict not just within the religion but in society as a whole.   Since the ruling class usually supports the existing religious institutions they will help stamp out any competing movements.  The way new movements get a foothold is by converting powerful people who can protect them.   You can see this in the different schools of Buddhism in China, and the many Protestant sects in Europe.  Compare that sort of division with the many \"cults\" in ancient Rome or India.   Polytheistic religions are not as hostile to cults as long as they don't detract from the cults that support the political structure.   In ancient Rome people could join any cult and worship any god that they wanted, as long as they supported the government cult as well.  This is not a problem for polytheists because their theology allows the worship many gods.   Temples and religious cults were responsible for performing the rituals for their particular gods.    What we would call religious belief was handled by schools of philosophy.   Schools of philosophy were independent from the the worship of any particular gods.  In India still today there is no central religious institution governing all Hindus.  Anyone can support any temple or any god who they are interested in (baring caste restrictions).  In India they also have a separate parallel system of gurus (teachers), which is very similar to the ancient Roman system of schools of philosophy.   Although (unlike Ancient Rome) in India most teachers are associated with particular deities.   Being dedicated to a particular deity doesn't stop a devotee from paying respect to other deities.  I like to say that for pagans gods are like grandparents: everyone has them, everyone thinks theirs are the best, but everyone knows that everyone else feels the same way about theirs and is polite about it, and no one claims that their grandparents are the only ones that exist (that would just be rude).  Of course foreigners are weird and have strange customs and strange gods, that is just the way foreigners are. ",
