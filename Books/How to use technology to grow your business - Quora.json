No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business (source 1). Detailed (source 2) Faster, More Comprehensive CommunicationSometimes, radical improvements in communication made possible by the internet and associated devices -- such as laptops and smart phones -- can become so sophisticated as to become oppressive. Nobody needs 200 business emails a day. Nevertheless, once you organize your communication tactics and strategies around these available communication resources, things will move faster. They'll also move more reliably, via apps that timestamp the opening of emails to clients and they'll do so at a lower cost, once you beat back your cell phone provider's monthly charges, that is -- or you move to a lower cost provider, as rates continue to fall. 2. Resource Management These same communication technologies are already changing resource management and eventually will radically restructure how we work. Today, a single operator can deploy various military resources all over the globe. Tomorrow, a single operator will be able control and supervise fleets of unmanned transport vehicles at lower cost, with higher reliability and lower accident rates. 3. Labor Savings The most significant emerging technologies already changing the way we work are in automation and automated learning. Tesla's production plant for its new Model 3 electric passenger vehicle has very few workers, and they're largely there to observe and -- when necessary -- correct or modify a production process. Most of the work is done via machines that communicate directly with one another. 4. Safety Advantages One of the more remarkable increases in worker safety during the past 50 years has been in the inherently risky business of automobile racing. In the 1950s, there were five Formula One fatalities. Although there were many more Formula One events in the 1990s, there were only two fatalities during the entire decade.
