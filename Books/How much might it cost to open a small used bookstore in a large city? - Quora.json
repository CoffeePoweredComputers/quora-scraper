            "answer_text": "we have had three her\\e in Atlanta and all failed. to open u buying space or leasing. Cities carry different permits licenses etc. you need shelving and display cases .. etc.. though may be cheaper to open on online. a used online book store. That would be even cheaper. Then course advertising .. And going to need backup cash for first 3 months to see if you can make enough to survive. and will there be a computerized system. And will u be borrowing from a bank or have cash , bank you then get a interest charge going have to pay. Or are you going have a used book store that can order new books on request? It' seems be cheap to open but Theresa bit more to it than just opening one it being able make it profitable to sustain itself. My sister thought of doing that and changed her mind. Think it was a good move. and course location can cost quite a bit too. Here in Atlanta I live in the artsy side town and all store owners here complain of rent they paying. They pay it of course Because of the location.. though a lot of the small business selling things like pawn shop grocery store gas station things like that sold out and left over the years. So even in a good location your product may not be popular enough to survive. But to answer your question.. rent here for a small store AND I MEAN 16' BY WHAT 12' runs around 2-4 grand a month. Then your advertising- signage-be probably in news paper and course store signage can run 5 grand. more if neon kind. used to help graphic artist hang his signs he made for people it's very expensive. signage is not cheap. so figure 500-1,200 for signage. permits. no clue what permits cost. again depends on state and county.. say 500.. shelving for books tables you want chairs for people sit and or carpet. carpet costs what these days 3.00 a square yard or more? so figure in can you build shelves your self buy used? say 1,000 maybe more way more if new. bathroom. will u need add one or one exists? and do u need refinish it.. paint the space .. ?? in a city that has ridiculous taxes like ny or Boston I say 10- 20 grand just get the doors open. in atl and took over some one else's lease or a book store that failed probably could get for 6-8 grand. But I really guessing here. but I think a more realistic number be 15- 20 grand. And that could cover things that came up you weren't a where of. or a bad month. ",

            "answer_text": "Beyond what the books themselves cost, and buying in bulk from estates, library discards, thrift shops, and boy is it easy to put together a massive inventory of books that apparently no one wants or that the inventory turnover is measured in many years instead of months (that's horribly bad for any kind of retail.)   Knowing your local market for it's actual tastes should define your inventory but it rarely does with people stocking books they like themselves.    The space lease is extremely important, being in an out of the way, easily overlooked or forgotten location is more typically a pre-ordained doom for any small independent retail store, ideally you should be near lots of workplaces with well educated workers who can browse your store on their lunch hour (even then this is a very difficult business.)   Since the store fixtures are book shelves, those are much lower cost and easier to build than any (oak planks work the best for hardcovers, cheap pine supports paperbacks easily.)    The cash register/point of sale/computer inventory system will run a $600-3000.    Adding upholstered chairs and coffee tables is a proven technique too many used bookstores still skip (skimping on display space too is another common oversight.)   Adding beverage sales adds considerably more revenue and activity, book buyers tend to be tea or coffee drinkers and fairly tidy (it's why the big chains haven't seen their inventories destroyed with food and beverages sold on site for decades now.)   Forgetting an advertising budget is a classic way of making this seem doable while dooming it as well.    Figure $20,000 at the do-it-yourself  very small store level and $100,000+ plus if you do a large shop, of course you'll mostly be working for free and most of it's open hours if not all of them, these are more \"hobby gone bad\" businesses or something to do even with a strong section of collectible books.
