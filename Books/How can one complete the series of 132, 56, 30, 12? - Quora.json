            "answer_text": "Missing term = 90 Complete series = 132, 90, 56, 30, 12  132 = 11*1256 = 7*830 = 5*612 = 3*4So, basically it is a product of two consecutive natural numbers. The missing numbers are 9 & 10.So, the missing term will be 9*10 = 90 and it will come between 132 and 56. Edit: Another answer for this question could be if we are trying to find the next term which follows the given terms. In such a case,  Missing term = 6 Complete series = 132, 56, 30, 12, 6 Same logic as above applies. The only difference is now we are not looking for a missing term in between but the next term that may follow. So, if we look at the first part of the two consecutive numbers that are multiplied, they are 11, 7, 5, and 3. They are all prime numbers. Next prime number is 2. Next term in the series will be 2*3 = 6 Thanks Mohit Singh for suggesting this. ",
