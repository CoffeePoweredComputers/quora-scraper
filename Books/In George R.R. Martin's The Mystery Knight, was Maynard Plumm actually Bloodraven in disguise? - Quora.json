            "answer_text": "It is highly likely that he was. GRRM has dropped us way too many hints. It starts with Maynard\u2019s jape before the wedding:  Dunk had heard such talk before. Aegon the Unworthy had bedded half the maidens in the realm and fathered bastards on the lot of them, supposedly. Worse, the old king had legitimized them all upon his deathbed; the baseborn ones born of tavern wenches, whores, and shepherd girls, and the Great Bastards whose mothers had been highborn.   \"We'd all be bastard sons of old King Aegon if half these tales were true.\"  \"And who's to say we're not?\" Ser Maynard quipped. Bloodraven is a great bastard of King Aegon. Then he defends Bloodraven  \"Myself, I blame Bloodraven,\" Ser Kyle went on. \"He is the King's Hand, yet he does nothing, whilst the krakens spread flame and terror up and down the sunset sea.\"  Ser Maynard gave a shrug. \"His eye is fixed on Tyrosh, where Bittersteel sits in exile, plotting with the sons of Daemon Blackfyre. So he keeps the king's ships close at hand, lest they attempt to cross.\" Something about Plumm troubled Dunk:  \"Stay well away from that one,\" Dunk warned Egg. There was something about Plumm that troubled him. \"He could be a robber knight, for all we know.\"   The warning only seemed to make Ser Maynard more interesting to Egg. \"I never knew a robber knight. Do you think he means to rob the dragon's egg?\" And Bloodraven is the one who robs the egg, as we find out later He knew about the plot from the beginning:  Maynard Plumm gave a laugh. \"The fiddle of chivalry, you mean. That boy is fiddling up a storm, and all of us would do well to be gone from here before it breaks.\" He warns Dunk to take Egg away from this place:  \"I know that eggs do well to stay out of frying pans,\" said Plumm. \"Whitewalls is not a healthy place for the boy.\" He says to Dunk:  \"Venture a guess, ser. You have two eyes.\" As against Bloodraven who has only one. Another hint:  Through the rain, all he could make out was a hooded shape and a single pale white eye This shape was Plumm and \u2018single eye\u2019 and \u2018pale white colour\u2019 are features of Bloodraven. Plumm talks about Alyn as if he had the authority (and wish) to execute him. A hedge knight cannot execute a lord.  \"Save him now to execute him later? I think not. He knew WAY TOO MUCH about what happened and what egg did:  \"So I surmise. He showed the ring to Maester Lothar, who delivered him to Butterwell, who no doubt pissed his breeches at the sight of it and started wondering if he had chosen the wrong side and how much Bloodraven knows of this conspiracy. The answer to that last is 'quite a lot.' \" Plumm chuckled. And saying that Bloodraven knows \u2018quite a lot\u2019 is an obvious sign. There was something queer about Plumm\u2019s features:  This close, there was something queer about the cast of Ser Maynard's features. The longer Dunk looked, the less he seemed to see. And the biggest hint. Plumm and Bloodraven use the exact same phrase while referring to the gathering at Whitewalls:  \"A friend,\" said Maynard Plumm. \"One who has been watching you, and wondering at your presence in this nest of adders. Now be quiet, until we get you mended.\" While Bloodraven asks Dunk:  How is that I come to find my cousin in this nest of adders, ser? GRRM is a genius. ",
