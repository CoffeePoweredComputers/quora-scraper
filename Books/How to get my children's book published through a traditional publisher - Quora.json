            "answer_text": "As a publisher, when I look at authors who want to publish children\u2019s book, I look to their connections where they can market the book. Let\u2019s face it, kids don\u2019t buy books, parents and other adults do. An author with no connections to other parents, teachers, librarians and others who make the decisions on the books purchased for their children is of little interest to me to publish. Also adults who write children\u2019s book, but don\u2019t have kids are a red flag. From a publishers standpoint it\u2019s simply a matter of how likely is the author going to be able to sell their book. Authors looking for the publisher to do all the marketing and sales has their heads in the clouds. As with every book, we look at our chances of making back our investment for publishing a book. Informing a publisher in your query letter of your existing ties to your audience and your following are huge and a big determining factor as to whether we decide to option a book. ",
