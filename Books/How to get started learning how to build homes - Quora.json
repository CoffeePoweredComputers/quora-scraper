            "answer_text": "You may want to consider getting a construction management degree. I don\u2019t know where you live, so I can\u2019t advise any particular trade schools or other places for you to go. However one thing you could do that wouldn\u2019t cost much is to volunteer to work for your local Habitat For Humanities. They need workers and you would learn on the job site. Some of the volunteers own construction companies. It would be a good place to show off your ambition and get to know some great people. Try getting a job with a local Contractor. They always need clean up people and errand runners. If your eyes and ears are open and your mouth is shut you can learn a lot just by watching. Also a couple manuals that would help immensely would be a Handbook of Architectural Working Drawings (hardcover by Wiley) and an Architectural Graphics Standards Manual. Both can be had on eBay for reasonable prices. Code manuals are boring as hell but informative, I have several and they come in handy. Get the student version of the Graphics Manual. (less money) because its paper back, both books are over 500 pages packed full of information. It\u2019s OK if they are a few years old, those are less money. When seeking a position you should have a little speech ready to tell people your desires and goals. Believe me, if it\u2019s well rehearsed, it will get their attention, and they may want to help you more than you think. Construction Worker is the least most wanted profession among college entry students. In fact, in the US it ranked 500 out of the top 500 most wanted professions. LAST PLACE!  On top of that the last recession deleted thousands upon thousands of construction workers. Especially the older (over 40) more experienced ones. Most of those people retrained and secured more recession hardy jobs and will never return to the building industry, especially with some of the wages they still want to pay. Many contractors don\u2019t even want to pay an average wage for that hard work. But some are coming around finally. I\u2019m betting that\u2019s why there\u2019s a huge vacuum in the construction worker pool, so, worker wages will have to go up over average wage before they ever fill that void.   Builders still haven\u2019t learned that the value of their company is equal to the workers and the wages they pay. When you pay crappy wages you get crappy apathetic workers\u2026 those people build crappy buildings. Right now, the housing shortage in CA is very intense and there are no signs of relief in the near future. (Several factors causing this and some political) So you might be entering this market at the right time, there should be lots of work. I got my start in the late 60s at 2 dollars an hour working for a Mason Contractor, which just happened to be my grandfather. I was with him for 4 years until he died. He taught me all about building foundations, real masonry and brick fireplaces, and concrete flat work. You could say my grandfather gave me a great construction foundation. I wasn\u2019t paid very much, but now I really know my way around the construction site. I look back on the start he gave me and get filled up with love, even though I battled recessions every 10 years for 40 years. Which is probably what helped develop the love/ hate relationship I have for the construction industry. Just remember one thing, be the first one to show up at the work site, learn as much as you can about all the trades, and do the best job you can even if you aren\u2019t getting paid well, because your good reputation will precede you. Wait\u2026 that\u2019s 3 things!   Good luck young man, if you need any help let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "Man, it depends. I mean, how do I learn to play guitar? Practice right? Here is the thing. A home at it's basic level is only made up of a few components. But, and that is a really big but, how these components are put it place and the subtle environmental factors that effect these components can be huge and costly if done wrong. I am a concrete guy, so naturally I believe the foundation is the most important ingredient of the entire enchilada..and the Bible concurs, for the record.  I have seen my share of quick and dirty foundation work , I have seen the effects of these as well. Would you believe a shifting foundation can be a direct cause for homeowner nightmares such as: Doors that won't open, close or seal.Windows that will not open or close.Water pipes that break.Sewer lines breaking and cloggingSagging roofs and generally ugly appearance of facia and siding. Rodent and insect infestations...nothing like a subterranean gap opening up to invite creatures from below. Parts of the home pitching out of level where you are shimming up furniture.Tile popping up from the floor, repeatedly. You get the drift. However, it is not rocket science right? So HOW do you want to build houses? You want to be able to say that you built it with your own two hands? Or do you want to design and facilitate home construction so you can TELL people at parties \" I am in Construction, I build homes\". The later will make you more money faster, and impress people quicker, but you'd still be a poser to those of us who can build a home with our own two hands. If you are honest that building intrigues you, and you are not willing to quit your day job and become a carpenters helper to do it, I have a suggestion or two that is feasible. Find a friend who can build houses. Hang out on Saturday or whenever and watch, better yet help. Pay attention to the stages as they start, finish and the next one begins; lot clearing and leveling foundation framing doors, windows and siding roughing in of plumbing, electrical and duct workBACKING-don't forget the backing its a bitch to do laterroofinginsulationsheetrockpaintcabinets, door/window casings and trimflooring, sometimes in before cabinets if done correctlyplumbing, electric and mechanical trim-out...you know sinks, faucets, outlets, switches and vent diffusersappliancesexterior paint utilities all connectedINSPECTIONS, I changed my mind, want to learn how to NOT build a house? Make an inspector friend, that's all they like to talk about usually. How Everyone does it wrong, then ask him to show you how to do it, friendship over.Or you could read a book, I'm sure they have them on home building. In seriousness, get next to someone who knows what they are doing, do some reading when you can and hang out at least watching how a house is put together. Learning how to actually do it? Practice.Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "I did it by choosing a plan to start with from a book of architectural plans for self-build projects. I then used UK Building Regulations to see how houses were constructed in every detail, along with visiting local building sites where both traditionally built (ie breezeblock and brick cladding) and timber frame (timber frame with facing brick cladding) were built. Wearing a trench coat and green wellies made me look like the Building Inspector, so work improved when I was walking around the site! I asked questions on how the various works were progressing and got some good info from the builders anxious to impress the (fake) Inspector. I then did all the electrical and plumbing design (pretty easy for a marine engineer), drawn on all the plans, plus the drainage, connection to main drains, surface water drains, gas, electricity utilities etc., along with the central heating system, roofing and insulation. I put the plans in to the local planning authority and got them passed A1 without a single hiccup - until I went to buy the land to build my self-designed house on. I had my eye on a 10 acre plot that at the time was up for grabs at some \u00a3100,000 (in the 70s), so I thought I would buy an acre of that for \u00a310,000 which was pretty cheap for an acre in those days, and the sewerage and utilities were already on site with the roads being built by the owner of the land selling the plots. Off I went to the estate agent to earmark my 1 acre plot, only to be told that I had to buy the whole ten acres! I and others were a bit miffed at that, and the land got sold to a builder who threw up a bunch of Airfix houses all looking the same, and probably made millions out of it. Our self-build group would have built a rather nice individual estate, but it was not to be\u2026 Still got the plans somewhere! Some years later I showed the plans to my brother, a Captain of Industry in the property business and he asked who had done them because they were about the best and most detailed that he\u2019d ever seen. When I told him I had done it he said \u201cHow did you know how to do all that??\u201d So now you know - Marine Engineers can do anything\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Good question! The traditional route is as good as any, in fact better than some! Go and be a labourer on a building site. I'll be honest here, you can even afford to do this for free for a while, if no one will offer a paid job. Because the payback comes later on, once you know your way around the game. How do you do this? Go for a walk and look for a building site, either ring the number on the sign, or walk in and ask the guys on the ground who is the boss. The other way is a Polytechnic approach, do a pre trade course. Honestly, I view that as inferior. Curiousity is a far better teacher than someone's set programme. Construction is one of those things where a widespread understanding is good, so don't discount going and working on a commercial construction site. Something of a time honoured tradition in the game, if someone bowls up to a site, and asks for a job, if you can offer it, you should - that said, the law around health and safety does mean you need to be a little prepared, probably with safety boots, eye protection, maybe even hard hat and high vis. Be open and honest, and ask the question, someone will take a punt on you. If you want to be even smarter about it, ask around, who are the best builders in town? Ring them and make your case. Remember, in this game, pay rate up front doesn't mean much, you make your money when you buy or renovate your own homes with your skill. ",

I\u2019ve met high school educated people whom have gone on to owning and operating their own multi million dollar subcontracting firms after years, as in 5\u201310, of working as laborers, apprentices and journeymen.
