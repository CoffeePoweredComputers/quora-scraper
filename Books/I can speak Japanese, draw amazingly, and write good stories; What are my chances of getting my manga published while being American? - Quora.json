Post several stories, this is what many writers do, and you\u2019ll probably get attention of a publisher. Most important part is don\u2019t give up. If you\u2019re good enough to be a mangaka, you\u2019re going to be published, if not, you refine your skills and try again. ",

Also you can go and publish printed and kindle Manga in Amazon publish with shared profits. And try to publish in more languages (English, Spanish, French) there are many western fans. All it takes is one good episode to start the wild fire. Good luck. \\U0001f44d ",
