            "answer_text": "Gatsby describes the opulence many Americans enjoyed BEFORE the Great Depression. It also alludes to the wealth it was possible to accrue by breaking the laws imposed by Prohibition. The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, four years before the start of the Great Depression. Like everyone else Fitzgerald had no way of knowing what would occur in 1929. The novel\u2019s only relationship to events in 1929 is its vivid description of life BEFORE \u201cBlack Tuesday\u201d when over night most of the very wealthy became impoverished. ",
