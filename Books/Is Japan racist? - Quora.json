            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, other answers here have neglected to mention the giant \u201csecret\u201d\u009d racism that exists in Japan and probably always will because they refuse to address it. I am talking about the burakumin, the \u201cuntouchables\u201d in Japanese society. Why this can remain a secret is because the oppressed people look exactly like every other Japanese. The roots of this system came about with the Buddhist injunction not to kill any creature. But someone had to slaughter beasts for various reasons, had to produce leather, etc. Someone had to dispose of dead bodies, so the Japanese created a class of eta, or \u201cfilthies,\u201d who were destined to get no jobs but the bad ones and not to have contact with regular societies. Japanese record keeping of their citizens is thorough, and complete, and goes back a long, long way. Whenever a person changes residences, they must report to their new regional civic office and register who they are, their families and where they came from. This allows anyone to go look up generations of your life. To this day if you are found to have any connection with the eta, or to have come from a known village of etas, you don\u2019t get the job and you don\u2019t get the bride. Although technically this discrimination is illegal in Japan (I believe it was outlawed during the American Occupation), it still happens. It\u2019s just that no one speaks about it. When I learned about this and started asking questions, I was told never to talk about it and never to use the word eta. The Japanese are very class-conscious people, and perhaps because they did not, of their own accord, outlaw the discriminatory practice, it just went underground. But it still happens, silently, and word gets out that so-and-so is unclean. It\u2019s despicable. Often I was confronted by people who told me America was so racist (it is) but Japan was not, just one word would end the discussion\u2026eta. ",

            "answer_text": "Is Japan a racist country? Historically, Japan has had quite a bad reputation. Starting with the isolationist period from the 17th century until 1853 - Sakoku (\u9396\u56fd), to the horrific treatment of the Chinese, Koreans, and other nationalities before and during WW2. Additionally, being an island can help foster a stronger sense of uniqueness that can lead to the discrimination of other races/nationalities. However the true answer is probably both yes and no. To be honest all countries are somewhat racist, or have people in them who are racist. I quite like living here, but there are sometimes when people have made false assumptions about me simply because I look different. Or alternatively, there is a false placed pride in the effectiveness of Japanese companies, technology, and culture. A myth that is also effectively spread by international media outlets, and various international sub-groups/fan-boys/girls such as those exaggerating the effectiveness of Katanas (Japanese swords) . Additionally, what is considered as racist will vary greatly depending on your culture/country. For example, during Halloween here I\u2019ve seen some pretty interesting costumes here. The level of detail on the Michael Jackson costume was incredibly accurate (even including the skin colour). Plus if you want to turn up as a white guy, you can pick up a cheap costume in \u30c9\u30f3\u30ad\u30db\u30fc\u30c6 (Don Quijote)  Clearly, to most people around the world this type of stuff is considered highly racist (it definitely wouldn\u2019t be acceptable in the UK for sure). - Sorry, I\u2019m not posting the photo of the blacked-up MJ, it is a bit too unacceptable even as an illustration. However, the racism the could be accredited to the above is mostly due to naivet\u00e9 and people being unaware how racist it could be perceived as being. For example my black Canadian friend has to constantly put up with people touching her braids, and the stares in the onsens can be off putting. However, despite her living in a tiny backwater village outside Kumamoto, the local people have welcomed her and are taking great delight in teaching her many aspects of Japanese culture etc\u2026 So this type of stuff can mostly be put down to misplaced curiosity. Or maybe a lack of understanding. As an illustration, recently in my city of Fukuoka I saw this gentleman walking around the subway. As someone who used to live in Bermondsey (the southern part - I\u2019m not that rich) I can guarantee that he would probably have the opportunity to experience the high quality care that the NHS has to offer. However, most people here on Quora (and Japan) will be unaware of what the phrase \u201crod my dog\u201d means (though many can guess). Therefore, offensiveness won't be felt so much - not to mention the desecration of the national treasures of Wallace and Gromit. So I\u2019m prepared to tolerate this level of stuff.  However, there is a deeper darker side of racism that you can find here. You get many warnings of what can happen to foreigners here if you get arrested by the police, and that naturally they take the side of their fellow citizens. Thankfully, I\u2019ve not been in that much trouble so I don\u2019t think in can comment too much on that. Or I\u2019ve seen signs in shops that say Japanese only (shameless plug for one of my previous answers provided below). Have you ever seen a \u201cJapanese only\u201d sign in real life? By in large, the racism that I have seen here are usually made with disparaging comments about other countries, in particular China and Korea. This stuff really annoys me, particularly I\u2019ve heard people complain that now the majority of convenience store staff are now Chinese, that \u201cnow many foreigners are moving to Japan to work\u201d, or that all British food is crap and we can\u2019t cook. Additionally, some of the older generation will now complain about poor service by labelling the staff as Chinese. There\u2019s also the assumption that anything coming from China will be of poor quality, which is true for some things, but definitely not all. Some of my foreign female friends have also complained about the reticence of (some) Japanese men to date women from different ethnicities, which narrows their range of eligible men quite drastically. This has been corroborated by reading some answers on Quora regarding inter-racial dating here in Japan. Additionally, I\u2019m particularly sensitive to the accusation that as a foreign guy I\u2019m coming here to Japan to \u201csteal\u201d or use their women. That said I feel that the tide is turning somewhat. One example is that of my professor/boss. Who having been to several conferences in China, and collaborated with Chinese scientists, will quite happily admit that on the whole top end Chinese university students are more ambitious and motivated to succeed, are more willing to speak English, and are unafraid of taking risks such as travelling abroad. Additionally, many people are now watching Korean dramas, and some are into some K-pop bands, which removes some of the negative perceptions of Korea. A second aspect would be the treatment of children of other nationalities, or mixed race children at local schools. Talking with one of my friends of mixed heritage being in school in the late 80s to early 90s was a very tough time for her. However, talking with some children from my church who are half-British and half-Chinese this discrimination doesn\u2019t seem to be quite as bad (but sadly there are still some difficulties). From my own experience, a greater exposure to multiple ethnicities and cultures can help prevent racist attitudes. And as immigration to Japan gradually increases, and Japanese people begin to have a broader global outlook, hopefully racist incidents and attitudes will begin to decrease. In general, crass stereotypes and feelings of hatred to a particular people group, can only exist if you can\u2019t put a face to a name. ",
