            "answer_text": "Hundreds of thousands, but first let\u2019s clarify whether you want to own the books or just be able to read them. This answer may also depend on where you are located. You can get some books from Amazon or other sites that are absolutely free, no strings attached, and you can keep them as long as you want. These aren\u2019t generally best-sellers and new releases or well-known authors. BUT if you don\u2019t care about owning the book indefinitely, most public libraries in the US allow you to borrow eBooks. These are loans. Just like borrowing a physical book, it has to be returned within a certain amount of time - usually 2 to 3 weeks. (and your Kindle automatically does that as long as it is connected to the internet). This gives you access to newer and more popular books, although there is often a wait list for really popular ones. I think I can safely say that there are enough books available to me from my public library at any given time that I won\u2019t run out of \u201cfree\u201d reading material in my lifetime. ",

Your public library can be a great place to get specific Kindle books you want to read, for free. Amazon itself has lots. You can search free Kindle books, or sort books by price, lowest to highest, or set the price in the search at 0.00. Other online booksellers have many free e-books. You can search the same way. There are sites and email groups to alert you to free and cheap books. I have Book Bub and Book Gorilla. Quora has over 100 answers about how to get free e-books. What are some good places to get free e-books that are legal and ethical? The answer feeds for this topic are full of spam and repetitive answers, can we please start a new (July 2018) thread? What are the best websites for downloading free Kindle books? ",
