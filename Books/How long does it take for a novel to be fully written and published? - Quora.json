            "answer_text": "In the Trad world, authors write 1 or 2 books a year. Each book then takes about a year to be published. (Trad authors feel free to correct me if I wrong these days.) In the Indie world: There are plenty of authors writing and publishing a book every 2 weeks. These are authors writing 10,000 words a day, who write cleanly with almost no editing required, and only a few days proofreading.There are plenty of authors writing and publishing monthly, 6 weekly, and 8 weekly, then out to 3 monthly, 4 monthly, 6 monthly, and yearly.There are plenty of books which took over a year to write, and even more which took anywhere from 2 years to 20 years to write.Publishing requires a cover, a blurb, and the finished book. Then about 15 minutes of your time to fill in the metadata, upload the book and cover, and submit.Both Trad and Indie now use pre-orders. Trad tend to pre-order for 6 months to a year away.Indies pre-order when they have the cover. This can be as little as 3 days, and as much as they want.Lots of Indie authors now pre-order the next book around the time their current book is released, overestimating the time for writing, then as it gets near, they bring forward the release date, and sometimes do it again as soon as the final version is uploaded and tested.In terms of first book Trad publishing: Time to write the bookplus Time to find an agentplus Time for the agent to find a publisherplus a year to publish.In the meantime, the Indie author has probably published 6 to 12 novels and is potentially earning 5 figures a year.

            "answer_text": "That varies with the author. Some writers I talk with say they\u2019ve been working on the same book for years. My first books took years to finish. Once you finish a few it becomes easier. I did 70k in 28 days, but it still took 8 months in editing to get that book out. If the author can afford an editor, it might take 2 months to write and get the book ready. If you self-publish that takes a few days maximum. If you traditionally publish it can take anywhere from 4 to 10 months for that book to get into distribution. That\u2019s provided you have already placed the book with the publisher because you\u2019re an established author, maybe under contract. If you are a newbie you have to get an agent. That can take anywhere from two days to two years. Then the agent has to place the book with a publisher. That can take a year or more. 0.1% or less of the proposals and submissions made by authors and agents GET published. (Philip K. Dick an established short story and sci fi author gave his agent 12 general fiction manuscripts and the agent couldn\u2019t place ONE with a publisher. That\u2019s how hard it is.) Publishers don\u2019t just push a book out. They publish 15,000 titles a year, there are six other mainstream publishers doing the same thing, and everyone lets everyone know weeks in advance through papers like Publisher\u2019s Weekly, so once books have their covers designed, go through copy editing, typesetting, and marketing for review the publisher has to decide WHEN to put THAT particular book out. Then it has to be printed. Then it comes into the warehouse. Then it gets shipped on the release date that was publicized in Library Journal and Publisher\u2019s weekly and is sent to Ingram and Baker & Taylor, Barnes & Noble, and ReaderLink. With self-publishing the moment the author thinks it\u2019s done, they have a nice blurb, and a good looking cover, they press a button and in one to three days it\u2019s out. ",
