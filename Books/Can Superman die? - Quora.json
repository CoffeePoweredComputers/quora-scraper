            "answer_text": "There have been stories that depicted an aging Superman . Sometimes he\u2019s been shown with gray hair on his temples, sometimes he\u2019s been shown with a long white beard, and sometimes he\u2019s been shown with completely white hair . At one point, the writers at DC Comics didn\u2019t generally think of him as having a longer lifespan than ordinary humans, so he could get old and die . If he\u2019s exposed to Kryptonite long enough, he\u2019ll weaken and die . There was a \u201cWhat If\u201d story in the early 1960s where Lex Luthor pretended to become a good citizen and to become Superman\u2019s friend . At one point, Luthor exposed Superman to a chunk of green Kryptonite, and gloated until Superman gave up the ghost and died . Superman\u2019s friends from all over the universe visited Earth to view his body and pay their last respects . The effect of Superman\u2019s death on Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White was depicted . Finally Supergirl grabbed Lex Luthor and took him to the Kryptonian bottle city of Kandor to stand trial for the murder of Superman . To my memory, Superman and Supergirl were named citizens of Kandor, so anybody who somehow killed them was subject to Kandorian justice . Lex Luthor had one ace up his sleeve \u2014 in exchange for a pardon for the murder of Superman, he\u2019d enlarge Kandor to normal size . He thought the Kandorians would go for that in a heartbeat . The judges of Kandor refused ( \u201cKandorians don\u2019t make deals with murderers !\u201d ) and Luthor was sentenced to the Phantom Zone . There was one story where Superman was in a coma hovering between life and death . The Martian Manhunter dematerialized and passed through Superman, jump \u2014 starting him back to life . In the 1990s, Superman was beaten to death by a super \u2014 powered monster named \u201cDoomsday\u201d . There was a tiny spark of life in his body, he somehow recovered, and he asked out loud \u201cWill I ever really die ?\u201d . Dr . Occult, a little \u2014 known hero, walked up to Superman and said \u201cYes, Superman, one day you\u2019ll die, but let\u2019s hope that day is a long way off !\u201d . That\u2019s all I can tell you about the subject . I imagine it\u2019s enough . ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Superman can die. But the only way for him to truly stay dead is if he does himself in. Case in point: the top spot in the 15 Times Superman Killed His Enemies.  Most famously Superman was killed in his fight with Doomsday, however not too long after the Man of Steel returned with gloriously flowing locks.  A far more permanent death, came in Alan Moore\u2019s \u201cWhatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\u201d story arc, which was the last one of the Silver Age Superman and was billed as \u201cthe last Superman story.\u201d  When Superman kills Mxyzptlk in that story\u2019s end, it has a major impact on him. So appalled is he at having violated his oath against killing, Superman realizes he has become his own worst enemy.  As penance, he decides there is only one recourse. With one final super smile, Superman walks into a nearby room of Gold Kryptonite, permanently removing all his superpowers and pretty much committing super suicide.  Alan Moore said that he wanted \u201cWhatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\u201d to serve as a complete conclusion to Superman\u2019s mythology. Even though the ending indirectly reveals that a powerless-Superman lived on, having taken the name Jordan Elliot (get it?) and settled down to a typical middle-class suburban life married to Lois Lane, it doesn\u2019t mean the world\u2019s greatest superhero isn\u2019t still both literally and figuratively dead.

            "answer_text": "So, he gets his superpowers from yellow stars and he also stores some of it like a solar battery. So, if you take him away from a yellow star for long enough then eventually his batteries will run out (so to speak) and he will be left without any superpowers and you could just do anything to kill him that would kill you or I, such as stab or shoot him. Kryptonite functions for him very much like highly radioactive materials do for humans. If you lock him in a room full of Kryptonite what will happen is that he will become violently ill and weakened but he will neither instantly die nor lose all his powers. So, although our Metropolis Marvel is terribly sick and in so much pain that he can barely stand up, he is still Superman. So attempting to shoot him as he\u2019s writhing on the ground in agony, the bullet will still ricochet off him. He is slowly being poisoned to death but he\u2019s also so near-instantly ill that although he may still technically be able to punch you pretty hard and his skin is still impenetrable, he\u2019s barely able to lift his own body to even attempt it. And if he doesn\u2019t get away from it soon, he\u2019ll get increasingly weaker and weaker until he\u2019s not able to lift himself up and remove himself from the danger and he will slip into a coma and die. Presumably, he is also mortal and eventually will die of old age. He at least comes from a race of mortal beings. It\u2019s ultimately unclear. Thaddeus Howze's answer to As long as Superman is around the yellow sun, he seems to be immortal (except for Kryptonite). However, he does appear to age. Can Superman die of old age? ",

And he was only able to return to life because of his adoptive father Jonathan Kent and the kryptonian entity known as the Eradicator.  In the Smallville TV show, Clark also died once and Jor-El had to bring him back at the cost that someone else was going to die in Clark place, some day soon.  Clark also died another time later on, but J'onn J'onzz uses his Martian powers to take Clark to the sun which revives him.   In the comics in alternate timelines and even in the main timeline, Superman has almost died or actually died for good. So yes. Superman can die. But like Dr Occult once said \u201cSuperman can die he's simply difficult to kill off for good\u201d ",

But knowing DC, they've made multiple versions of him, and I believe that some versions of Superman are more resistant than others, so I can't give you an answer with every single version. ",

Superman is a mortal character; if he wasn\u2019t, why would his parents put him on a rocket ship to Earth? If he was immortal, the destruction of Krypton would have had no impact on him. Superman has been hurt badly - in fact it was thought that he had died when he fought doomsday in the comics back in the early 1990s. He was not dead but in a deep coma and would eventually return. There have some stories where he has \u201cdied\u201d. Here is an article that I found: 15 Times Superman Has \"Died\" ",
