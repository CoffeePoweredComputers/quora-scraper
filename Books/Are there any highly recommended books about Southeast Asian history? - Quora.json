A textbook I co-authored and edited is widely used in college courses on modern Southeast Asian history: https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Modern-Southeast-Asia-History/dp/0824828909/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518460587&sr=1-1&keywords=emergence+of+modern+southeast+asia I recommend it. Highly. It even has nice period photographs and other illustrations. There are other good books on Southeast Asian history, some of them covering more than the past three hundred years or so (which is all my book covers). But why should I give them extra publicity? ;-} ",
