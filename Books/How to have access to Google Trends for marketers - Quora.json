            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need any special access. Where traditional keyword research tools are focused on delivering exact-match monthly keyword volume, Google Trends wasn\u2019t built to hand over static keyword volume; it was built to generate visual, dynamic insights that paint a portrait of the life of a keyword phrase \u2013 past, present, and potentially (as much as we can predict it) future. Self-proclaimed by Google as the \u201calways-on Google zeitgeist,\u201d Google created Trends so we could see the pulse of search as it happens with stats about trending phrases and hot-right-now queries at our fingertips, and as it happened with 2004-to-present historical data. Unlike keyword research, which tends to be very one-dimensional, Trends shows you a multidimensional view of queries and how they have evolved as a result of factors like seasonality, geographic location, and media coverage. I think if you want to have more detail analys about your site and your customers, you should combine Google trends and TEA software. Threat and Engagement Analytics Software was created by ShopingCartElite developers. They eliminate poor engagement traffic by using smart ROI reports to detect the best visits by country, geo-location, time and day. Then you can allocate the right budget to the right time and drive only excellent engaged visitors to your website. Disclosure: I'm software developer and used this solution. ",
