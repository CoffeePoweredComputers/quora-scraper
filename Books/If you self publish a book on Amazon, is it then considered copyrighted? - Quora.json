            "answer_text": "As the author, you own the copyright. However, if you choose Amazon\u2019s 70 percent royalty rate instead of 35 percent you are giving them an exclusive right to sell the digital book for the full term of the agreement. In other words, you can\u2019t distribute the digital book anywhere else, not even on your own website, unless you cancel the contract by written notice. At the higher royalty rate you are also forced to participate in Kindle\u2019s lending library. In the lower royalty pan you can opt in or out. Even after you cancel your agreement, Amazon can continue to distribute for a while in order to fulfill any standing orders or deplete stock on hand. Be sure to read all of their terms and conditions before you decide on a plan. Amazon has this information on its website: What does it mean to publish exclusively on Kindle? When you choose to enroll your book in KDP Select, you're committing to make the digital format of that book available exclusively through KDP. During the period of exclusivity, you cannot distribute your book digitally anywhere else, including on your website, blogs, etc. However, you can continue to distribute your book in physical format, or in any format other than digital.I have been in the publishing business for many years. When in doubt, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer. Tip: Check out How to Self Publish a Book | Self Publishing | Print on Demand | IngramSpark as an alternative. They distribute through Amazon, too. Also, check out Authorlink for more information on reading and writing. ",

            "answer_text": "The moment the creative work is FINISHED in it\u2019s entire form (that means you edited it, rewrote it and set it up for publishing) it is automatically copyrighted. When you put the book on Amazon it is considered published. That is using up your EXCLUSIVE FIRST RIGHT or publication. You can never offer that right again. To help secure your copyright you should have posted notice. You must also follow the laws of your nation. In American you have 90 days from date of publication to pay $45 to $65 and register your copyright in order to be able to sue in Federal Court, get $2,500 damages per violation and attorney fees. If you DO NOT have a numbered form you CANNOT file a lawsuit in Federal Court for piracy of your work. ",
