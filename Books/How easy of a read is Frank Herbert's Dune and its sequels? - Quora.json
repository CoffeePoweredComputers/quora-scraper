            "answer_text": "Dune is a masterpiece. I read it first when I was around 15, and became immediately lost in it.  I was in Oakland a few years ago (I'm now 43) and got locked out of a friend's house (long story) and spent the night walking around, finally settling in a hospital waiting area, where I tried to catch some sleep. After a security guard threw me out around 3am, accusing me of being homeless, I happened across a bookstore that left a little bookshelf on wheels out a night, with a sign explaining their honor system, full of mostly mediocre books.  (The bookstore is off Piedmont Avenue.) But I saw the familiar Dune logo, like a diamond buried among charcoal, grabbed it, dropped a dollar in the mailbox, and found an apartment building with a small lobby, and started devouring the book, again. Herbert immediately sedates your mind and brings you into his fantasy world, and the book feels like a complex dream. When I put the book down again it was 7AM. I don't want to give anything away, but you've got to grab Dune and I'm sure you'll devour it too.  By the way, I read Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury in college, and honestly did not enjoy it at all. Made little sense to me, and felt laborious to read.  Herbert's writing is not difficult at all. Any average 8th grader could read, and understand it. That is also true of Hemingway, the greatest prose writer in history (one man's opinion). The value of a book has no correlation to its obscurity, or difficulty. If you want another obscure book to decipher, read Joyce's Ulysses. I don't think Faulkner could shine Joyce's shoes, to be honest. Where in my opinion, Fury was a literary experiment gone wrong, Ulysses is a true masterpiece. But again, who am I to say? ",

            "answer_text": "I started reading it at 19. I was a full-time undergrad at the time and found it to be a bit heavy for the sort of books I liked to pour through in between class readings. I was able to follow it pretty well (the glossary in the back certainly helped, though the appendices just complicated the reading and made it harder for me) but the pace was slow and I lost patience. I was 2/3 of the way through heading into finals, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be up to reading it then so I set it aside. I did intend to go back to it, but never did. When I was 25 I decided to give it another go. It had been so long that I started from the beginning. It took me a few chapters to get used to Herbert\u2019s writing style, the pseudo-Arabic vocabulary, and the very alien setting. Once I did I found it a pretty easy read. About three weeks\u2019 worth of reading, a little more perhaps, at a point in my life where I had lots of time to devote to pleasure reading, but wasn\u2019t sitting around reading it night and day or anything. How does it compare to similar series? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit less accessible than other classic sci fi series like Foundation and Lensman, but much more readable than fellow \u201csprawling epics\u201d such as LotR and GoT. ",
