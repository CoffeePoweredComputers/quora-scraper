Any time I believe I can\u2019t do something or that I haven\u2019t contributed to the world enough for my life in it, I have that book (times thirteen other versions/translations) sitting in my bookcase to prove me wrong. Writing is my way of contributing to a better world. There will always be haters or detractors or people who don\u2019t get it \u2014 I write about harder topics and their effects, such as childhood abuse or family issues \u2014 But the fan mail I get from kids, teens, even adults who thank me for wording what they couldn\u2019t, or for outing subject matter others ignore or don\u2019t want to touch \u2014 It says it all. When I get letters from teens who wish they were LGBTQ instead of physically or sexually abused because the former seems lauded and embraced and the latter feels like a dirty secret, a silent life sentence \u2026 It\u2019s when I know I\u2019m doing my part. We were all born with ways to add sparkle and hope, relief and connection to this often unfair and rough world. Find yours and share it with us. And thank you for doing so. \u2665\ufe0f ",

Originally when I first started writing fictional stories five years ago, I never believed my stories were good enough to publish through traditional channels, but I took a chance and uploaded my first book to Amazon about six months after I\u2019d finished it. To my surprise, I got a few sales and uploaded my second book, two weeks later (I was writing a series). Fast forward five years and yesterday I uploaded another story in one of my seven series. I did a quick tally and that was my 59th book. I have a small but loyal bunch of readers who seem to love what I do and thanks to that, I have been supporting myself financially for the past five years. I might not be able to call myself \u201cpublished\u201d but I still consider myself a full-time and self-sustaining author. Have a lovely day :) ",
