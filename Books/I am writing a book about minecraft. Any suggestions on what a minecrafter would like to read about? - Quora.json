            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer, because the first ideas that come to mind are ones that are done to death. I used to play minecraft and read about it until I was pale. (I was in middle school when it was popular.) I would rather not read about strategies. Due to the game's nature, the strategies in minigames are  too similar to write about. Your target audience will probably have a vast knowledge about how to win in different areas.  I guarantee that they won't know your opinions, stories, and how the game has positively (or negatively, if you want to piss readers off) affected your life. You should ask yourself questions that have varied answers. \"What makes a good server?\" (Not talking about network speed!) \"What kind of people have you met through Minecraft?\" \"What is something you don't like about Minecraft?\" Etc. Your opinions are valuable when all the facts have been used! Nobody wants to read a book about why the two tight end system in football is better than the read option for the gajillionth time. Thank you for the question! ",

            "answer_text": "Try something that is less about the game, and more about the metagame. What kinds of things have players as a whole decided on since Minecraft's debut? What is considered standard operating procedure for the first few in-game days? What kinds of things are avoided, not out of efficiency or mechanical benefit, but out of a sense of propriety? What kind of community springs up in a game like this? How does it differ from more established gaming communities like World of Warcraft? How does having a home base you built with your bare pixelated hands affect how you play the game? What do players bring into the game from outside? What do modders do with this game? ",
