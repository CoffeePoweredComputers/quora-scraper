            "answer_text": "With over 5 million titles, Kindle books definitely have their own following. However, don\u2019t discount the power of print books. They are making a slow, yet steady comeback, and more authors are jumping on this gravy train. Five reasons I believe authors should take full advantage of the print platform: 1. Print books are their own best marketing tool. Other people can see your print book \u2013 On the bus, in a coffee shop, at work. Someone looking for a good book to read will see and remember that your book is being read and enjoyed. 2. Everyone and their uncle seems to have an ebook nowadays. There are now over 5 million Kindle ebooks, but an astonishing number of them are poorly designed and riddled with typos. Not only that, Epub and Mobi formatting still isn\u2019t perfect. It seems the true art of beautiful writing has been diluted, and people are beginning to lose their trust in the ebook style. 3. Print books pay better royalties. According to The Author\u2019s Guild, publishers pay a lower royalty percentage for ebooks. Print books are still a better payout for indie authors. 4. Print books are more pleasing to handle. The pages are soft and pliable, and reading a physical book is more comfortable to the eyes, whereas reading an ebook is like staring at a computer screen \u2013 it can cause fatigue a lot sooner. Plus, it\u2019s so much easier to flip back and forth to recapture certain elements and events of the story. Bookmarking is a breeze. 5. Bookstores are still a really cool hangout. Indie bookstores continue to thrive in spite of Amazon or other online book retailers, with a 35% growth between 2009 and 2015. According to research conducted at Harvard Business School, this bookselling resurgence is based on the \u201c3 C\u2019s\u201d: Community, Curation, and Convening. Indie bookstores (and national chains) continue to facilitate community connection, curate a more personalized customer experience, and offer events such as lectures, book signings, reading groups, and game nights. Still, after 25 years, one of my favorite things to do is visit my favorite bookstore, grab a coffee, and peruse the shelves for a comfort book. One I can bring home and cozy up to.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you market wisely, you can get a lot of downloads (even if they're free) and reviews. The more downloads you get, the more word of mouth advertising you get, which leads to more purchases. People leave reviews on the book, and other people decide to read the book based on the amount of good reviews. The more reviews you have, the better your book sells. You can also put your book into Amazon Unlimited to be borrowed, and you get paid based on the amount of pages read. Off of Amazon, you start marketing your book and promoting it on sites. You guest post on blogs. You post on social media. Your srreet team posts on social media for you to share your book. You write a press release or two for some local papers and news outlets. You have a few Author Talks in your community and surrounding communities. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. It is a lot of work, but the idea is to be seen everywhere and get the buzz going about your book. The more you do and the better you market, the better the results. Also, authors tend to be more successful if they publish multiple times a year and have multiple books out to where they can collectively start seeing profits. I know of authors who make 6 figures a month on their books; they have been publishing for at least a few years now and they have a good collection of books under theur belt to achieve this. ",
