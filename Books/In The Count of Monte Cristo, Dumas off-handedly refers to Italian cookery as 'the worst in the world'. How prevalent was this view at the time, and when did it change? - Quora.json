Still it seems a pretty broad statement. I personally love Italian cookery, but then again having never been to Italy, it could be the Americanized version of Italian cooking I like. I have heard that pizzas here are very different from those made in Italy. The Italian pizzas are supposed to be more bland and don't have the variety of toppings we have. Then different regions of Italy have different styles of cooking, so he may have been talking about a particular region of Italy. ",

Perhaps Dumas, like most Frenchmen, considered anything other than French cuisine to be inferior (?) Could anyone else answer the question? ",
