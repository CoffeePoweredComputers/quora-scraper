            "answer_text": "According to Richard Friedman in his excellent book, \"Who Wrote the Bible,\" it is possible that the J-source (see Documentary Hypothesis), or at least portions of it, was written by a woman. There have been other scholars who have delved deeper into this theory and they provide some compelling arguments. I have only scanned through all of the other answers to this, but I'm sure the theory that a woman may have written Hebrews in the NT has been mentioned also. I also have read -I think- in the answers above that is was unlikely a woman could have been a scribe in the time in which much of the material which is now known as the Bible would have been written; but I would argue that the Bible is filled with stories of remarkable women. Think of Deborah for example: it has long been thought that the \"Song of Deborah\" was the oldest writing in the Bible -due to its seemingly more primitive Hebrew. Though that hypothesis has been challenged in recent years -with some compelling arguments against it being as dated as once thought- it is still credited in the Bible itself to a woman. A critical literary approach to certain passages also reveals details which may indicate that they were written by a woman. It is important to remember that the Bible is a composite of writings which includes multiple authors; thus, it is not incomprehensible to imagine a woman may have written certain passages, if not an entire source -as Friedman implies of the J-source. One example is found in the second creation account (Gen 2:4\u20132:25) in which the Hebrew word \"ezer kenegdo\" is used to describe the woman. Generally translated in English as \"helpmate,\" or \"helpmeet,\" the word quite literally translates as \"helpful counterpart\" -which denotes equality. In fact, a better translation may be \"a strong equal helper.\" It is strange to find such a phrase -which may be the earliest example of feminism- in a work so dedicated to patriarchy. Also, where some have found in the description of the creation of the woman a reason for the historical dominance of patriarchy within western so-called \"Judeo-Christian\" societies, others see the creation of the woman as more positive towards women, i.e., a man is not complete until he is in union with a woman. This could indicate a female author. Now I know I am getting off course, but this brings me to an old belief among many Jewish mystics, that the first created human being, which was called by Kabbalists \"Adam Ha-Rishon\" (primoridal human consciousness -not flesh being), was both male and female (joined back to back similar to Siamese Twins). It was said that when the two were literally sawed in half by G-d, after becoming defiled through a sexual act (metaphorically represented by the story of Eden), evil and suffering then entered the world. Thus, in the esoteric sense, the separation of the masculine and feminine aspects of Divinity are represented by the Edenic story of the two trees. According to this tradition, the holy union between male and female (the \"hieros gamos\" in esoteric terms) represents the eventual reunion of the masculine and feminine (Shekinah) aspects of the Divine, which will restore things to their rightful state, I. E., Eden. There is much more to this old tradition, which I do not have the time to go into -not to mention I have gotten way off topic- but my point is this: even in the male-dominated world of the Bible it was understood among many that man and woman were co-equals, and thus it is not inconceivable that a woman could have written parts of the Bible.

            "answer_text": "Maybe. So many of the authors of the various books of the Bible, and in some cases different parts of books, are unknown. So, in light of this unknown status of many authors, can we rule out female authorship? Think about Ruth, or Judith? Or even Tobit, or parts of Daniel? What about the theory that the Blessed Virgin Mary provided to Luke much of the information written in chapters one and two of his Gospel? What about St. Peter\u2019s wife? Did she she get involved in St. Peter\u2019s authorship or dictation of the letters attributed to him? I certainly cannot say for certain there were not female authors or contributors to the books of the Bible. ",

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know for certain certain sections are written in what is considered a female form. The bible was started to be written down around 600BCE and took years of collating, rewriting and more there was a definite Babylonian influence on the writing of it and that also affected some parts of the religion as well. One of the main differences between the Samaritans and traditional Judean Jews was dress and some biblical differences. The min one being the sacred mount. There is a possible that some of the scribes who preserved the biblical texts in the Essene cult (Dead Sea Scrolls) were female. Some of the texts to do with Jesus or Yeshua as he was actually known are suspected to have been written by women there\u2019s some support for this when you consider that many of the first places of Christian worship were funded by women or held in women\u2019s houses especially in the Greek cities.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by author. God is the authority of the Bible. Moses is traditionally considered the author of the first five books, though obviously he didn't physically write them because one of them deals with his death. She might think of it as he commissioned them. Okay who wrote them? Maybe lots of different people. All of that just to say who knows? Obviously none of the apostolic books. The Old Testament though? Who knows. Roman society was very patriarchal. every one of the New Testament books is associated with one of the Apostles. They were all men. We don't know specifically who physically wrote the Old Testament books. ",
