            "answer_text": "*Thanks for the A2A! I wouldn\u2019t learn Calculus from a textbook, as a quick head\u2019s up. I would use it for working out examples that could further my understanding, but I will never use it to teach myself a new concept. YouTube is a great platform for doing that. MIT, a prestigious college known for its science and mathematics, posts all of its lectures for free online, as well as many other professors and lecturers. If you are looking for some good textbooks, I\u2019d recommend this one because it gives detailed explanations for each of its 1000 problems:  Don\u2019t rush into it, though. You need to be fluent in trigonometry and all algebra courses; geometry isn\u2019t really a huge deal. It will take a long time; I\u2019ve been self-studying calculus for about 6 months now, and I am still not completely finished with Calc 1 or Calc 2, although I am very far in. I haven\u2019t started on Calc 3, Linear Algebra or Quantum Mechanics, which is my end goal. ",

If you continue to search on forums for the best Calculus book, a lot of people will say they prefer Thomas over Stewart\u2019s, but not by much. Therefore Thomas Early Transcendentals should be a solid purchase and a great way to learn Calculus. ",
