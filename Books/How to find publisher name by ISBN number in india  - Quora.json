            "answer_text": "The answer to your question is partly explained on wikipedia [International Standard Book Number - Wikipedia] . I am reproducing the text from Wikipedia for immediate reference, as follows; The registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979).Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.The single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are:0 or 1 for English-speaking countries;2 for French-speaking countries;3 for German-speaking countries;4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and7 for People's Republic of China.An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated group IDs are: 0\u20135, 600\u2013621, 7, 80\u201394, 950\u2013989, 9926\u20139989, and 99901\u201399976.Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.",
