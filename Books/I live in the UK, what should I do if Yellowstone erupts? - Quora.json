            "answer_text": "The eruption of Yellow Stone will be critical to most of North America, but Europe won\u2019t be affected by it\u2019s firsthand calamities. Pyroclastic Flow will certainly decimate various cities in America. If in England, moving to places far away from Yellow Stone is advised, but this should be brief: the eruption of Yellow Stone will interfere with plane flights, so a best method is to use a boat, or you could drive through Europe, though this may take a while. Basically, any means to temporarily take refuge. After no longer than the equivalent time of a vacation, you should return to England, make sure to lock down your house to avoid looting, and gather as much food as you can. ",
