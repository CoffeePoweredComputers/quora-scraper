            "answer_text": "The CGI route has been covered by other people and it's valid. However there's another method that has been used for decades and should not be overlooked because it still works. You can rent cardboard people. More specifically they are half people known as Audience Cutouts. You can rent hundreds or even thousands of them. They're actually only 3 people. There is a Caucasian man, an African American man and an Asian woman. They are life size flat cut outs that sit in the slot of a piece of 2 by 4 which is placed on a stadium bench or bleacher seat. They are put up in random order and generally being that they are rentals they're all completely different because previous art departments have painted their clothes different colors and given the mustaches hats etcetra so while looking at them you can clearly tell whether it's one of the men or the woman, these cardboard clones have some personality. You're probably asking yourself how is a cardboard half person believable? Excellent question. First of all because stadium seats rise, each person's torso covers the implied legs of the people behind them. More importantly, the foreground row or 2 will be populated with 100% real background performers. The thing that makes the cut outs believeable is that real background performers will be scattered among them probably in a ten to one ratio so that for every 10 cardboard cut outs there is a live human who is specifically instructed to never stop moving during the takes whether it's gentle movement or frantic movement and this in wide shots is all that is required to distract you from the rest of the scene and create the very convincing illusion that a section of stadium is populated with a 1000 live people when it's a hundred or perhaps less. Something to this effect can be done and then replicated over and over with CGI to create tens of thousands of people in a stadium. I used them in the boxing movie N.B.T. (aka Nothing But Trouble) and even in closer groups of a mere dozen people (8 cardboard and 4 human) there's no way you can tell\u2026 the smoky, top-lit boxing atmosphere helped. You would not be able to shoot them that close in a daytime baseball game. They are cheaper to feed than real extras and never need breaks or overtime. I highly recommend them. ",

            "answer_text": "For closeups you'd just shoot a couple dozen actors and/or extras packed together in a tight group. However, I'm gonna assume that you're really asking about how you shoot a wide scene of a fully packed stadium.  In a lot of cases, you'd have to build a CG model of a stadium, and use crowd simulation software such as Massive to populate it with CG crowd characters.  Not an easy task!  But, easier than finding 100,000 extras to fill a real stadium. This breakdown video from \"The Secret of Their Eyes\" gives you an idea of the process:   ",
