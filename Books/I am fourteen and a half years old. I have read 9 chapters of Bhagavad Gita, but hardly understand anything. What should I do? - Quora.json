            "answer_text": "Unfortunately you cannot press on through Bhagavad gita and think that it will all fall into place at the end. Bhagavad gita progresses from one point to another, like mathematics. Chapter 2 has 72 verses which are a summary of the whole Gita. It is essential to understand the concepts in this chapter to make sense of the later chapters. From text 12 - 30 the nature of the soul is described, this must be understood clearly. 31 - 38 describe activities and duty. 39 -49 elaborate on these duties and give more information and the results and purpose of performing these duties. 50 - 53 start to emphasize acting with devotion. 55 - 72 elaborate on the results of these activities and the symptoms and experiences that result from them. Go one verse at a time and understand each verse before going forward to the next. Bhagavad Gita As It Is has wonderful purports that explain each verse, but even then sometimes more clarification is needed. It is necessary to see the information from Krishna\u2019s point of view, which is going to be different to ours. If we don\u2019t agree with some point it is necessary to see it differently so that we can understand it from Krishna\u2019s point of view. I remember reading \u201cFrom the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.\u201dBg 8.16 And I thought that\u2019s not true, there\u2019s a lot of happiness in this world, I have experienced it! Why does Krishna say everywhere is miserable? But when you think a little more you can see that death is unavoidable and it causes misery. What is the use of whatever happiness we experience as long as death hangs over our head? We are so conditioned to accept death as inevitable that we don\u2019t even stop and think of it as a problem. Yeah I know, I will die, but not now, so let me enjoy for now. We get so absorbed in the details of our life that we don\u2019t see that it will all end at some point. If we look at the world from Krishna\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s a joke. A mass of suffering and then death. It really is miserable if you live in another world where there is no suffering and no death. So take your time and think deeply on each verse till you are confident that you have understood the point, and then move on. If you get stuck, then that\u2019s what Quora is for! ",

            "answer_text": "Stop reading and start listening. There are high chances that you may not understand what Sri Krishna actually intended to tell even if you can understand the literature. For you to understand the real hidden meaning and see it meaningfully applicable to the current day to day life you will have to listen to the sayings of some swamijies. I wanted to know gita and my mother tongue being Telugu googled and got hold of the website: pravachanams.com where in there is listings of talks by many swamijies, i pickedup the swamiji with max no of episodes (i didnt know how to pickup then); however this turned out to be a good choice. I kept on researching and found the swamiji: Tattvavidhananda saraswathi-s very helpful. Dont refer to some random talks of swamijis on youtube (esp the once who give lectures in IITs). To start with, atleast till u research and findout a suitable one, i would recommend you to http://www.avgsatsang.org/hhstvs.html  where in the above pujya swamiji talks in USA abt gita are present. Infact, in one of the talks pujya swamiji says of a diamond merchant offering him a choice to pick any diamond ring from his jewelery shop impressed by his (pujya swamiji-s) sayings. The talks are very very elaborated and i would recommend you to have a slot of 40-50 min before you attempt to listen to the talks; they are very interesting and thought provoking; infact you will be amazed to know howmany things we take for granted and how to understand oneself properly.  Of all his talks i liked his interpretation of God (now even an atheist would agreed of the Gods presence every where); esp his interpretation of Lord Vishnu where he has 2 wives! Gayatri maha manthra.. is my favourite! I would encourage you to regularly listen to them~! ",
