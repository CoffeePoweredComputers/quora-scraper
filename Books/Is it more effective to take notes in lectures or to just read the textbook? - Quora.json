            "answer_text": "That depends on the instructor/teacher/professor and the student. An autism condition makes lectures very difficult for me to recall without notes, and there is NO way I can keep up with audio instruction if I must  write everything down. However, I really like the suggestion to take notes IN THE TEXTBOOK.  Just that much spur to memory can be enough I won\u2019t forget what the instructor said differently or emphasized over other things. However, that same autism condition meant that if I read several textbooks on the same subject a few times through, I could find even two-word notes useful as long as I had pointers to the lecturer\u2019s specific point. At work, taking some of the mandatory administrative courses many times required, I found that I would do better to use a speech to text program to speak high points into a  text file. If one works in a high-security environment, that\u2019s going to require considerable effort to get the software needed to use the work computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it effective to take notes in lectures or to just read the textbook? I find it useful. When I was in Class X, I found it extremely difficult to understand As You Like It. I used to take running notes and my pages were black in pencil notes being smudged. At home while studying, these notes helped me a lot in understanding the text. Towards the end of the book, I used to take lesser notes and I realised I was accustomed to the language used and the credit goes to those running notes.  In college too, I take down notes in the class. I can write really fast and believe me the rudimentary running notes constitute a separate note which I study in exams besides text.  Therefore, I must say that running notes are one of the most underrated things in our study life. It's often not possible to read every subject every day. If you take notes and attend regular classes, you will definitely remember at least the crux of the matter taught even if you fail to read 1 topic a day.  Good luck:-) ",
