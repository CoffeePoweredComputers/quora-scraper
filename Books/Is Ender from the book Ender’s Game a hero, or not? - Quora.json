            "answer_text": "Is Ender from the book Ender\u2019s Game a hero, or not? Definitely, for what is a hero but someone who does great deeds for his or her people?  Ender goes to hero school.Throughout history, \u2018heroes\u2019 have done terrible things to other humans but they are still celebrated. Think of Napoleon creating an Empire and terrifying Europe, think of Julius Caesar bringing the Gauls to their knees, think of Ghengis Khan conquering an empire far larger than any before. Each of these men were heroes to their people. To the people of Earth, attacked once by the aliens and fearing another attack, Ender\u2019s annihilation of the enemy fleets is certainly something that humanity would see as a heroic thing. Destroying these aliens was a prudent thing to pursue for a planet scared witless by a previous invasion that threatened to wipe us out. The aliens may have made a mistake by attacking Earth, and they paid the price. It\u2019s often cited that lack of communication between the two races led to the tragedy of the enemy\u2019s demise but even if Earth\u2019s leaders could communicate with them, why should Earth\u2019s leaders believe that the initial attack on Earth was a mistake? Surely the aliens would be smart enough to know humans are smart and have advanced technology? The only thing that could have stalled their destruction at Ender\u2019s hand is a full apology and a promise of massive reparations. Without that, the aliens were doomed.  To the people of Earth, Andrew \u201cEnder\u201d Wiggin is their greatest hero. CheersAndrew ",

            "answer_text": "Ender is a hero in that despite the hardship and agony of life at battle school, he perseveres and does his best. He never gives up on empathy, despite all of the military trying to twist that empathy into purely a weapon. Ender commits genocide but only unwittingly and against his will. He did not reject the Formica. He was never given a chance to accept them. In the end, though, empathy triumphs. Ender is able to save he formic race by finding the last queen (with a meeting and merging of their psychic abilities and his empathy). In doing so, he redeems himself and by extension humanity. The war was awful, but in the end, our capacity to love, forgive, and coexist, has survived. ",
