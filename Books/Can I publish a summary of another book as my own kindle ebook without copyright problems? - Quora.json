            "answer_text": "If you write a book whose express purpose is to enable other people to avoid having to buy some other book, by providing key information that is in that book, that speaks to the very heart and soul of intellectual property law. Even if you don\u2019t infringe on copyright in a technical sense, (copying text exactly), there\u2019s no question that you could and would be sued. You\u2019d be making money from someone else\u2019s creative work, and causing them direct financial loss by deliberately removing incentive for people to buy their book. It don\u2019t get much more sue-able than that. If you think what you are doing is legit because of the way you are handling it, then write to the authors and ask for permission. That\u2019s all you need, to publish anything. If you do\u2019nt feel comfortable telling them what the project is about\u2026then that kind of answers your question, doesn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a copyright lawyer, but this sounds sticky to me. In writing novels, I and other authors have wished to include a few lines from songs in our books, and the answer we have come up with is that you can reference a song by its title, you can talk ABOUT the song, but you cannot QUOTE the song.  You can write a book ABOUT software engineering that is more concise than other books that are available, but marketing a book as a summary of someone else's work, which would then entail copious quotes of that work, is bound to get you into trouble.
