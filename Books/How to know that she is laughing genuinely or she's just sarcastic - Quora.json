            "answer_text": "If she's laughing and making eye contact with you then she's genuinely laughing with you, if she was laughing at you sarcastically then she would avoid eye contact, quick eye shots but the majority of time bo eye contact and turning her next and looking in different direction. You can tell a real laugh from a fake also she may have found your joke no funny but she's digging you and faking the laugh which she will still make eye contact but the laugh will be short and subject most likely changed. Good luck with this girl you like, read books on body language, it will be helpful for the dating world along with the corporate world ",
