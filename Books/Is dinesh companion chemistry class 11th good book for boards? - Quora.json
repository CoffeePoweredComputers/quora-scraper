            "answer_text": "Actually I would rather suggest you to use it for entrance. Dinesh companion chemistry is a great book for entrance. It has more synopsis and mcqs than theory. So a better book for boards other than NCERT, will be Modern ABC. It covers the whole theory & provides a good number of solved & unsolved numericals. Hope this helps you:) ",
