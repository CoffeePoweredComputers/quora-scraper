            "answer_text": "It makes it very difficult - likely impossible. Publishers are also very mindful of these conflicts as they increasingly require submitting authors to make a declaration that all authors are in agreement with submitting the paper. Ignore this at your peril. I had experience of this very early in my career. My supervisor was supervising another student and having trouble finishing a joint paper. The student had very good access to some unique data, but otherwise was just a bit chaotic. He asked me to come on board with modelling, write-up etc., and the other coauthor at the time was in complete agreement and gave us carte blanche to do and go where we wanted.  We developed the paper significantly and submitted it to a high-quality journal, and almost immediately the other coauthor found out and came back to us very abusively, saying that the paper had diminished in quality (and having a fair bit negative to say about our research capacity) and he refused to put his name on it, contacting the editor to withdraw the paper, and threatening to make it a research ethics issue with our university, etc. etc. He was totally mad (if only just in the emotional sense) and subsequently it was revealed he was on medication for schizophrenia. My supervisor actually felt more sorry for him than anything. But what we could do other than drop the paper altogether and put it down to experience, especially as he effectively \u2018owned\u2019 the data and the background work. The only thing I can say is to do your homework on your co-authors BEFORE you research together. Possibly record, even if just in an email, what will be the purpose, roles, extent, etc. of your collaboration to minimize any future confusion and avoid conflict, however unlikely. And send around regular progress reports - at the least you\u2019ll be able to say \u201ctold you so\u2019 and get early warning of any emerging conflicts. It\u2019s not as if it would be anything you would want to use legally, but at least it may bring \u2018difficult\u2019 coauthors back on to the path. ",

            "answer_text": "First, is it possible? A qualified yes. There are issues with who actually owns the intellectual property (e.g, code, data, etc). However, it\u2019s usually a bad idea. It can create a permanent break. I\u2019ve seen this all but sink a grad student friend of mine. Second, assuming that you own the intellectual property (or rather, that the objecting author doesn\u2019t), you just publish. You should not keep this a secret from the objecting author. They should not be on the author list (unless they change their mind); I had a co-author drop off of a paper (for reason I don\u2019t even know; it was not a big deal and the author did not object to our publishing). But seriously, unless this is absolutely necessary, attempt to resolve the issue before publishing. These kinds of things can lead to permanent animosity and more long-term negative consequences than one publication will make up for. ",
