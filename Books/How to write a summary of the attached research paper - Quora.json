            "answer_text": "My recommendation is to start with the abstract, and look at the figures. The abstract should be in plain enough English to understand the point of the paper, and the figures should help you build an understanding of how the authors came to their conclusions while giving you a clue as to their methods. Using the content of the abstract, come up with a plain-words sentence telling what is the main point the authors are attempting to address, and what their findings were (in a broad sense). Then, read through the paper, starting with the intro, results, and discussion, and build in more details of why the study is important, and how it might be useful. Only read the methods section as a last resort if you don't understand how the authors arrived at their interpretation of their data. Your summary should in the end look like a simplified and shortened version of the abstract and the conclusion of the paper put together. If you have a good understanding of the paper by the end of this practice, you should be able to write your summary without having to look back at the abstract. For help understanding principal component analysis, I would look at a visual tutorial[1] or a brief introduction on PCA.[2] Footnotes[1] Principal Component Analysis explained visually[2] Introduction to Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
