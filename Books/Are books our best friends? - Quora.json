            "answer_text": "Machiavelli famously wrote that \u201c[w]hen evening comes, I return home and go into my study. On the threshold I strip off my muddy, sweaty, workday clothes, and put on the robes of court and palace, and in this graver dress I enter the antique courts of the ancients and am welcomed by them, and there I taste the food that alone is mine, and for which I was born. And there I make bold to speak to them and ask the motives of their actions, and they, in their humanity, reply to me. And for the space of four hours I forget the world, remember no vexation, fear poverty no more, tremble no more at death: I pass indeed into their world.\u201d Needless to say, that implies some kind of sodality, at the very least -- that books are a place where we can commune with the minds of the past, where we can draw upon the deep wells of knowledge that are our collective birthright, and in encountering alterity, encounter ourselves afresh. In that sense they are the dearest friends. But Aristotle was right when he called human beings social animals (zoa politika). There is a great deal to suggest that we need each other's company, each other's presence, to live. Whoever lives for reading alone runs the risk of finding in learning nothing but a lonely cage. Robert Burton learned this to his pain. Books train our minds to think, teach us how to feel, show us the way to new questions, help make us more interesting and sophisticated. But these aims are not strictly contemplative for most members of our species.  So although books are wonderful companions in our solitude, especially in what has become a culture-less and illiterate age, let's also remind ourselves of Francis Bacon's essay \"Of Studies\": \"To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the humor of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need proyning, by study; and studies themselves, do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.\" I'd say that's just about right. ",

            "answer_text": " Books are my friends, my companion. They make me laugh And cry and find meaning in life. --christopher paolim. Can you imagine your life without companions? Be it your parents, friends or soulmate! You can't. But how about books? They never walk away. The people who teach, advice and guide us may not always be there with us. But \"books could be our greatest friends\", they say. Books are like people we meet, we can pity or vilify them, venerate or love them. Every book we read stays with us in any form (experiences, memories, empathy n a lot more), one can think of. They give you so much that you wonder of recollecting at once. From being judgemental, enriching our mind, broadening our perspective, giving enormous knowledge, making us smarter, help forgetting troubles and curing loneliness to changing our perspective towards life, they are treasure house one can keep.... The treasure house of the knowledge that occupy your mind, the range of experiences that you can share. You become a thinking person, you have a world view, you'r perspective and have a knowledge of universe. And all this will feed into what you become and what mark you leave. Each book we read has the power to transpose us into a diff World. It's not just within the narrow confines of mere words but the time you go into books, you feel the noble thoughts they generate into you, you feel the characters well than what people actually encounter. Your whole life that you spend obersing and learning things are concised in a plot of a book thus reducing the chaos of confusion and making things more obvious. We think of literature as something very sophisticated but there are ways in which books organise and clarify our thoughts, concerns and beliefs thus simplying them and being your greatest aka best friends for life.

            "answer_text": "Man cannot live alone. He needs friends. Something he loves must. Therefore, he likes to live in the company of men or in the company of animals. There are some who love the company of Nature. There are also those who loved the company of books It is good to live in the company of bad books. But it is bad to fall in the company of bad books. Through the influence of bad books you can pick up bad habits without your knowing it. Therefore, you must select your direction with great care. You must make a choice wisely. But even the very best of books cannot give you everything. The company of books can give you knowledge but it cannot give you the practical expeience. No book can make you a great scientist. Newton was not born in a library. He did not read much. He lives in the company of plants and flowers. So, a library cannot make you a great poet or thinker. Even the books of your choice may make you only a bookworm. You get only second-hand information. You cannot believe everything unless you see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears. Therefore, you must come out of the world of books from time to time and live in the company of man and nature. The life of man and the life of Nature must be balanced up. A cut between book and life is full of dangers. So, read not only books but also the great Book of Life and Nature, after all It is said that \u201cworld is a book to read\u201d, but \u201ceach book is, self a world\u201d ",

The library is what drew me to the world of books. The long corridor lined with cupboards filled with thousands of books fascinated me as a child. It was the place where I spent most of my teenage years lost in the land of fantasy and fiction. St.Clare\u2019s introduced me to midnight feasts and friendly brawls. I solved mysteries with Nancy Drew, adventured with Famous Five and also belonged to the Baby Sitter\u2019s Club. Harry, Ron and Hermione became my best friends. Godfather presented me the thrill in the world of crime. Balance reflected India\u2019s history post Independence. Sherlock Holmes tutored my detective skills. Little Women became my family. Mr. Darcy, is not the one who falls in love you for your looks, but for the liveliness of your mind. Books have been my escape from the real world. You can do anything you want inside the pages of a book with no consequences. You can be whoever you want, man or woman, adult or child, hero or villain. You can hurt. You can kill. You can save the world with your supernatural power. Books keep secrets like best friends should. They never get jealous and they never spread rumors. They don\u2019t keep you out of their secrets. Books will always remain a part of my life.The messages of the books I\u2019ve read live inside me, and to touch their worn pages is to travel back in time, into a comfort zone that is only mine. \u201cBooks are love that never defy\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Early on in Catcher in the Rye, there's an implicit suggestion that books, in Holden's view, might be better than people. Myself, I think books are in a different category than people.  For instance, that annoying person who never stops talking and won't let you get a word in at all so that it's difficult to get away from them -- with a book, if it bothers you that much, you can just shut it.  Done, over. Best friends talk and listen.  They too need consoling and your sympathy.  It's a two-way street.  With a book, all a book needs is your engagement.  But it offers a great deal in return.  Some books are entertainment, others wisdom and reflection about their world, some factual, some beautiful and visual. When I am lowdown and in need of consolation, a human touch, I don't think books will do it.  I'd rather have my husband give me a hug.  On the other hand, when I want to read a 600 page Russian novel, I doubt my husband can hold out at length about changes to the lives of Russian serfs.  ",

Through the influence of bad books we get bad things.sone people are not interested in good things ,so they choose bad things they also get ideas after reading books but in wrong way it depends on mentality. The company of book can give you knowledge,but it cannot give you the practical experience.By reading books you can achieve motivational thoughts, inspire by people ,and many other things which you make different.For reading book,we don't need any library ,and environment we need only passion because Newton's does not born in any library ,but he has dedication,so he became scientist. So you should make friend your books \u2026\u2026 ",

When i was small i used to stay with my maternal grandfather, so every week he used to ask me to write a letter to my mother.And like a Disciplined child i used to do it every week. This letter writing continued till 4th standard.Then i moved with my parents.Well i come from army background where everything has a time frame to do things.We (With we i mean me and brother)were not allowed to watch TV. So i wanted to use my inner child my hyper activeness ,my energy.I was a difficult child to handle. My mom was an avid reader so i started putting my energy in reading.Sometimes it was good sometimes difficult to read.But i learnt it slowly. Now wherever i travel i always have 2 -3 books with me .I am not that person who like online reading i like to hold books,I like the way they smell.The papers,the color everything.You don\u2019t the feel of book online. Its been like 14\u201315 years my love for books is increasing and i really want to pass this legacy .  That\u2019s so me! Happy Reading! ",

Then the dog is your best friend.Do you love lots of me-time to think through how you would like to lead your life, how do you find purpose in your life, how people go through circumstances far more trying than ours and emerge victorious?

They serve to make you learned and capable. And much more besides As Bacon says STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment, and disposition of business.

He was, once again, a friend (despite his exams next day.) Again, it was not a book I shared my deepest, darkest secrets with. Not even a diary. She is a friend, a very dear one. My friend, books may give you company, knowledge but humans are fashioned in a way that they look for an emotional support. And that, comes from the animate, the mortals.
