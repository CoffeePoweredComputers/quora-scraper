            "answer_text": "The Kindle is much easier on your eyes than hardcover or paperbacks and way better than reading on your phone or a computer screen. The Kindle Paperwhite is wonderful if you do a lot of reading. I have about 5 different eye problems and I rarely read a \u201creal\" book anymore. Having to only read in the right light, in the daytime, and hope the format of the book is legible to me? No thanks! Even e-books have varying font types, sizes, and spacing. The Kindle lets me adjust all that and the Paperwhite has a matte non glare screen and adjustable brightness so I can read on a sunny day or in a dark bedroom. Result, eyes are less tired than any of the other choices for reading. And you can get library e-books delivered to any or all of your devices! ",

            "answer_text": "It can enlarge the text easily, making eye strain minimal. Reading in poor light is probably easier than reading a paper book because of this. The basic Kindle e-ink displays are probably better for long term reading since they don\u2019t emit light, especially the blue light frequencies which can disrupt sleep patterns. ",
