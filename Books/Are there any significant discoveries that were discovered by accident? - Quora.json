            "answer_text": "Penicillin  Forever enshrined in scientific legend, the discovery of penicillin\u2014a group of antibiotics used to combat a variety of bacterial infections\u2014is really just a case of dirty dishes. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming took an August vacation from his day-to-day work in the lab investigating staphylococci, known commonly as staph. Upon his return on Sept. 3, 1928, the perceptive scientist found a strange fungus on a culture he had left in his lab\u2014a fungus that had killed off all surrounding bacteria in the culture. Modern medicine was never the same. The Microwave  Sometimes all you really need to make the next leap in science is a snack. Percy Spencer was an American engineer who, while working for Raytheon, walked in front of a magnetron, a vacuum tube used to generate microwaves, and noticed that the chocolate bar in his pocket melted. In 1945 after a few more experiments (one involving an exploding egg), Spencer successfully invented the first microwave oven. The first models were a lot like the early computers: bulky and unrealistic. In 1967, compact microwaves would begin filling American homes. Snacking, then, is good for science. Velcro  On one particular hiking trip in 1941, Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral found burrs clinging to his pants and also to his dog's fur. On closer inspection, he found that the burr's hooks would cling to anything loop-shaped. If he could only artificially re-create the loops, he might be on to something. The result: Velcro. A combination of the words \"velvet\" and \"crochet,\" the material had trouble gaining traction in the fashion industry. But one of its most notable clients in the 1960s was NASA. The agency used the material in flight suits and to help secure items in zero gravity. After that, it became a space-age fashion all its own, allowing kids everywhere to put off learning how to tie shoelaces. The Big Bang  \"Big things have small beginnings.\" All right, so that's actually a quote from Michael Fassbender in (Prometheus,) but nothing could be more true for radio astronomer duo Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias. The secret to discovering the prevailing theory to how the universe was made began with noise, like common radio static. In 1964, while working with the Holmdel antenna in New Jersey, the two astronomers discovered a background noise that left them perplexed. After ruling out possible interference from urban areas, nuclear tests, or pigeons living in the antenna, Wilson and Penzias came across an explanation with Robert Dicke's theory that radiation leftover from a universe-forming big bang would now act as background cosmic radiation. In fact, only 37 miles from the Holmdel antenna at Princeton University, Dicke and his team had been searching for this background radiation. When he heard the news of Wilson and Penzias' discovery, he famously told his research partners, \"well boys, we've been scooped.\" Penzias and Wilson would go on to receive the Nobel Prize. Teflon  In 1938, Roy Plunkett, a scientist with DuPont, was working on ways to make refrigerators more home-friendly by searching for ways to replace the current refrigerant, which was primarily ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and propane. After opening the container on one particular sample he'd been developing, Plunkett found his experimental gas was gone. All that was left was a strange, slippery resin that was resistant to extreme heat and chemicals. In the 1940s the material was used by the Manhattan project. A decade later it found its way into the automotive industry. It wasn't until the '60s that Teflon would be used for its most noted application: nonstick cookware. Vulcanized Rubber  In the 1830s, natural rubber was a popular substance for waterproof shoes and boots, but its inability to withstand freezing temperatures and extreme heat soon left consumers and manufacturers frustrated. That led some to say rubber had no future, but Charles Goodyear disagreed. After years of trial and error trying to make rubber more durable, the scientist stumbled upon his greatest discovery by complete accident. In 1839, when showcasing his latest experiment, Goodyear accidentally dropped his rubber concoction on a hot stove. What he discovered was a charred leather-like substance with an elastic rim. Rubber was now weatherproof. Goodyear would never reap the benefits of his discovery and died $200,000 in debt. His surname and legacy live on, however, in the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which was named after him nearly 40 years after his death. Viagra  Angina Pectoris is a fancy name for chest pain\u2014specifically, spasms in the heart's coronary arteries. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer developed a pill named UK92480 to help constrict these arteries to relieve pain. The pill failed its primary purpose, but the secondary side effect was startling. The drug became known as Viagra, and you know what it does. Pfizer sold $288 million worth of the little blue pill in the first quarter of 2013. Smart Dust  Sometimes homework pays off, even when it blows up in your face. Chemistry graduate student Jamie Link was working on a silicon chip at the University of California, San Diego. When the chip shattered, she discovered (with the help of her professor) that the tiny bits of the chip were still sending signals, operating as tiny sensors. They coined the term \"smart dust\" for the small, self-assembling particles. Smart dust has a myriad of potential applications and plays a large role in attacking and destroying tumours.

            "answer_text": "Accident is the name of the greatest of all inventors. Some inventions which changed world\u2026 Sir Robert chesebrough (Vaseline) Robert was a chemist who used to refine kerosene, but after decrease in petrol price his business slowdown. One day during his visit to an oil refinery in Pennsylvania, he saw a worker removing some sticky thing from his body, when asked he told him that they used to apply it on burned or cut skin to heal the wound. Thus, Robert got his \u201cpetroleum jelly\u201d When local chemist didn't show any trust in his product, He even travelled to New York to give live demornstration of this product. In front of large crowd he burned his skin and applied it over. In few years Vaseline was popular worldwide. 2. George de Mestral- (velcro)   George de Mestral was a Swiss engineer, in 1941 he went in woods with his dog for hunting. on arriving back he noticed that Burr seed was clung to his dog's fur and his clothes, he wondered and examined Burr under microscope and discovered that it was covered in tiny hooks and by that he was inspired by Hook and loop method.  He researched for 8 years and named it velcro vel(velvet) and cro(crochet). A fastener way between buttons and zipper, it is now used in number of items including sandals,bags,toys,cords sweater to upto NASA. Burr(which gave idea)         One of the most used product.. 3. Humphrey O'Sullivan- (Rubber heeled shoes)  O'Sullivan was a young printer in Lowell, Massachusetts during 1895, he had to work on stone floor and had to stand while printing so wooden sole in his shoes and stone floor caused him pain in his feet. so he bought a rubber mat to stand on while working, his fellow employees kept borrowing that rubber mate from him, because it was too comfortable so, he cut out two pieces of mate in heel size and nailed them to shoes. He was pleased and astonished by the comfort of this shoes and started making full fledged rubber heels and eventually patented the idea. In a few years his heels were being shipped all over country, one of his advertisement in newspaper\u2026\u2026  4. Edouard Benedictus-(laminated glass)   Edouard a French chemist/scientist once was climbing a ladder and accidentally knock a glass flask of shelf. It fell to the floor and shattered but to his surprise shards of glass still remain in or almost in shape as before. He was confused and asked his assistant what was in the flask he said cellulose nitrate (liquid plastic). After the experiments a layer of cellulose nitrate remained in the flask prevented glass from breaking. This gave edouard idea of safety glass/laminated glass on windscreen which has saved so many lives after accidents. Swedish company Volvo used this safety glass first time in Volvo PV 44 as windscreen in 1944. 5. Percy Spenser-(microwave oven)  He was an American radar Engineer who used to focus on working and building of magnetron because magnetron generated microwave signals which was core mechanism of radar. One day when he was working a candy bar in his pocket melted at first he was confused and then he understood that it was miracle of the microwaves he put a Bowl of corn and made first \u201cmicrowaved popcorn\u201d.  Percy continued experimenting and made microwave by attaching a high density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. 6.Willis Carrier-(air conditioner)  In 1902 the Willis was given a project by his company buffalo forge to solve a problem of humidity in a lithographic and printing company in Brooklyn, they told him that the problem was that because of humidity in printing room ink would not dry. He worked several years on this project, one day in garden when he saw moisture droplets on an alluminium pipe, an idea struck his mind. he used pipe that would carry cold water and beneath them he kept two fan one would throw moist air towards pipe and other one kept moving air circulation of room.   Thanks to Willis otherwise imagine summer in cities like Delhi, Ahmadabad and Rajasthan(state) without air conditioner!! Present time air conditioner  The Best way to predict future is to invent it- Alan kay Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Discovery of Vulcanized Rubber is one hell of a story.  In the early 1830s, natural rubber was all the rage, but the excitement faded. People realized that their rubber would freeze and crack during the winter or melt into a sticky, smelly goo during the summer. Natural rubber could not stand extreme temperatures, so its popularity quickly died. Charles Goodyear spent years trying to overcome rubber's problems, and he only succeeded by mistake. Goodyear tried various powders to dry up the stickiness, but to no avail. Everything kept melting. These expensive experiments pushed his family into debt and resulted in jail time. Yet even in prison, Goodyear was undeterred from his goal. Some called him a mad man. According to a biography of Goodyear in Reader\u2019s Digest, he walked into a general store in Woburn, Mass., to show off his rubber products. This time the rubber had sulfur in it to act as a drying agent. Goodyear got so excited that the rubber flew out of his hands and landed on a hot stove. When he examined it, he noticed that it did not melt, but instead charred black. After poking and prodding, Goodyear also noticed that it still had the springy surface texture of rubber, the \u201cgum-elastic\u201d it was known for. Goodyear had made rubber weatherproof. Another tale tells a different story: Goodyear absent-mindedly turned out the lights to his makeshift lab and spilled his vials and test tubes containing sulfur, lead, and rubber onto a still-hot stove. The result was the same, a charred rubber-like substance that didn\u2019t melt in the extreme heat. After testing in freezing temperatures, Goodyear finally succeeded in reaching his goal, and it only happened because of a careless mistake. After many patent battles, Goodyear died still in debt. He didn\u2019t start the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. \u2013 the American company was instead named in his honor. \"Life,\" Goodyear wrote, \"should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents. I am not disposed to complain that I have planted and others have gathered the fruits. A man has cause for regret only when he sows and no one reaps.\" Picture Credit: WEEK 10: Vulcanized Rubber, ",

            "answer_text": "One unusually busy Easter weekend in 1982 at the Royal Perth Hospital in Australia, a young trainee doctor forgot to check his bacterial culture plates and left them in the incubator. The lab technicians would normally throw out the cultures after two days because anything that didn\u2019t grow in two days didn\u2019t exist. But this time, the doctor received an excited call from the microbiologist. When he returned to the lab, he found translucent islands of bacterial colonies growing on the agar. The bacterium was a new species that had never been described by microbiologists before: Helicobacter pylori, a fortuitous discovery after many failed attempts which eventually awarded him, Barry Marshall and his colleague Robin Warren the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005.  When Dr Warren had examined biopsies of patients with gastric ulcers and stomach cancer, he found a hazy layer over the ulcers in the stomach. Under the microscope, he saw tiny organisms in that layer and also observed a link between the severity of the inflammation and the number of bacteria. Warren hypothesized that the true cause of gastritis was an unknown species of bacteria, which according to the dogma at the time, could not exist in the hostile environment of the stomach. While Marshall and Warren were not the first to consider the possibility of a link between microbes and gastric ulcers, nobody had been able to isolate and grow these organisms so the observations were neglected. The unusually long incubation period was the secret of their serendipitous discovery. The long-standing belief in medical teaching and practice at the time was that stress was the main cause of peptic ulcer disease. To gastroenterologists, the concept of a germ causing ulcers was like saying that the Earth is flat. It inflamed not only the multibillion dollar drug industry but the entire field of endoscopy. Their discovery was rejected and took a long time to gain acceptance.  The thorniest challenge was proving that the existence of the bacteria found in the ulcers caused gastritis. The bacteria failed to cause ulcers in pigs. As a final resort, Marshall performed a radical experiment: he underwent gastric biopsy to prove that he didn't carry the bacterium, then deliberately infected himself by drinking a glass of the cloudy bacterial culture to show that it in fact caused acute gastric illness. (Although Marshall was gutsy, he was not reckless. He had worked out which antibiotics could kill the infection.) After a few days, he was ill, nauseated and vomiting. He was diagnosed with highly active gastritis. Helicobacter pylori was decisively the cause of gastric inflammation. Yet it took another decade for the resistant medical community to stomach this idea. Warren and Marshall\u2019s discovery that peptic ulcers are caused by an infectious disease allowed the cure of a major cause of sickness and death in young, otherwise healthy adults. ",

            "answer_text": "TGIF! The weekdays are over and the great Friday afternoon is at the door. People are chilled, and so are Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov, 2 Russian scientists at the University of Manchester. It\u2019s time to start their private fun game in the lab. The game is basically performing funny small scale experiments, not necessarily linked to their area of research. That is their way of celebrating the Friday evenings. In one such Friday in 2004, they started playing with a sticky scotch tape. They took a lump of graphite and started peeling it off, basically to study its electrical properties. As the flakes came out, they noticed some of them were thinner than the others. They repeated the process and by sticking and peeling back the tape several times, they eventually managed to create flakes, just one atom thick. They isolated GRAPHENE!!!  Graphene is a 2D material, consisting of planer sheets which are one atom thick, with atoms arranged in honeycomb shaped lattice.  Graphene is the material of the century. It has unique properties: It is the thinnest and strongest substance known to science. It\u2019s 100 times stronger than steel.A square meter of graphene, a thousand times thinner than paper, made into a hammock would be strong enough to cradle a 4kg cat.It is a good conductor of electricity, is stretchable and yet is almost transparent.It conducts heat better than any other known substance.It acts as a barrier to the smallest atom of gas \u2013 helium \u2013 and yet allows water vapor to pass through.It\u2019s bringing revolution to various sectors: Water purification (can play a huge role in desalination)Smartphone industryComputer industry (can replace Silicon chips)Manufacturing of next-generation satellites, planes and carsManufacturing of Rust free car (applying its water repelling and highly conductive properties)Making of bullet proof armors etcIt can be folded to form Carbon Nano Tubes (CNT) which has several uses. When these cool folks got Noble Prize in Physics in 2010, the noble committee cited the \u201cplayfulness\u201d that was one of the hallmarks of the way they have worked together. \u201cA playful idea is perfect to start things but then you need a really good scientific intuition that your playful experiment will lead to something, or it will stay as a joke forever,\u201d said Novoselov, in an interview with the Independent. Playing with a scotch tape on a Friday afternoon sounds like a joke, but Geim and Novoselov\u2019s scientific intuition, made it the most significant discovery of the decade.

            "answer_text": "Astronomy is different than all other sciences in that no one can do a controlled experiment. Astronomers watch what the Universe has to offer, and almost all the discoveries happen my accident, or there is a certain amount of luck in many of the discoveries: Discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background: Wilson and Penzias were picking up a weird background noise in their radio antenna. Annoyed they tried to clean up the pigeons poops, but the noise did not vanish. Turns out they discovered the cosmic microwave background, and were awarded Nobel prize in 1965 in Physics. They scooped cosmologist of their prizes as they embarking on an experiment to look for CMB.Discovery of quasars: Maarten Schmidt discovered quasar when when he took spectra of something that looked like a star. Quasars are supposed to be blackholes actively accreting, and have luminosity much larger than a typical galaxy like Milky Way. As they are much further, they allow us to learn about the early universe. Time magazine published Maarten\u2019s face on the front cover, a rare accolade for an astronomer.51 Pegasi b: Can planets be orbiting around a star in a mere 4 days orbit? Well no one would have suspected this, but then Mayor and Queloz found a Jupiter sized planet in such a small orbit in 1995. It started the whole discipline of exoplanet. And even today most of the planets we discover are often in orbits smaller than that of Mercury. Let me leave you on a funny note, which I remembered after reading the question: \u201cIn the early 1990s, Pfizer was testing out a drug called UK92480, intended to treat patients with angina, a common precursor to heart attacks, involving the constriction of blood vessels that supply the heart. The company was hoping the drug would relax the blood vessels. Mm, it failed in that regard, but test subjects reported some fascinating developments below the belt, and so became the little blue pill known as Viagra, a side effect of which is\u2014wait for it\u2014heart attacks.\u201d Excerpt from 24 Unintended Scientific Discoveries Edit: Thanks to William La Chenal for edits.

            "answer_text": "Here is an unusual one:  Not only was superglue discovered by accident, it was discovered twice! Here is how the story went down: in 1942, amidst WW2, Harry Coover was busy trying to make gun sights. He was a brilliant chemist whose efforts yielded a novel compound that could easily polymerise, the cyanoacrylate. In one attempt to fabricate clear plastic materials for gun sights indeed, he came up with a formulation that turned out to be very sticky, so sticky that could work very well as a fast adhesive but unsuitable for his current purposes. Therefore, Coover put his findings aside. In 1951, Coover changed job and got back into plastic research. This time, while searching for improved, heat resistant materials that could be used as aircraft canopies, he looked into cyanoacrylates again. As a research supervisor now, he witnessed his coworkers spread ethyl cyanoacrylate (a cyanoacrylate compound) on two prisms that almost immediately stuck together. This time, Coover became well aware of the commercial potential of such a discovery: indeed, cyanoacrylates quickly bond to many daily materials with just a little water to initiate the polymerisation reaction; this tiny amount of water is usually present as moisture on the materiales themselves so that they can adhere effortlessly. Eastman Kodak put this adhesive on the market in 1958 and initially called it Eastman #910, only to rename it Super Glue to make it catchier. Many other glue manufacturers followed suit. Nowadays, Super Glue is known everywhere and there exist many versions of it: a medical grade version, manufactured with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, is used to close up wounds.

C. Roentgen was working with a cathode ray tube in his laboratory. He was working with tubes similar to our fluorescent light bulbs. He evacuated the tube of all air, filled it with a special gas, and passed a high electric voltage through it. When he did this, the tube would produce a fluorescent glow. Roentgen shielded the tube with heavy black paper, and found that a green colored fluorescent light could be seen coming from a screen setting a few feet away from the tube. He realized that he had produced a previously unknown \"invisible light,\" or ray, that was being emitted from the tube; a ray that was capable of passing through the heavy paper covering the tube. Through additional experiments, he also found that the new ray would pass through most substances casting shadows of solid objects on pieces of film. He named the new ray X-ray, because in mathematics \"X\" is used to indicated the unknown quantity. US President James Garfield died in 1881 largely because his doctors could not locate an assassin\u2019s bullet in his body, while a century later, X-rays revealed the bullet in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s chest in minutes, helping to save his life. Newer medical imaging techniques such as CT scanning rely on Roentgen\u2019s discovery, but instead of sending X-rays through the patient\u2019s body from one direction only, beams are directed from many different angles, making it possible to create a much sharper two-dimensional image of the body\u2019s interior. Of course, the use of X-rays in medicine extends beyond diagnosis. In the years immediately following Roentgen\u2019s discovery, some investigators discovered that the same X-rays used to detect cancers in organs such as the lung and breast could also aid in treating such tumors, by damaging the DNA of cancerous cells.

            "answer_text": "Yep - Synthetic dye. Back in the 1850\u2019s, there wasn\u2019t a lot known about how molecules fitted together, although they did know that all materials were made up out of the same building blocks - that is, the chemical elements. Enter William Henry Perkin, a teenager with a love for chemistry. His father didn\u2019t think that that becoming a chemist would lead to a particularly successful career, but like all good teenagers following their passion, Perkin ignored him and went to study at the Royal College of Chemistry in London. There, he studied under August Wilhelm Hofmann, who was an expert on coal tar (a by-product from the production of coal). Hofmann had realised that coal tar and quinine, a medicine used to treat malaria, were composed of similar elements in similar ratios. So when Hofmann went off to Germany for spring break, Perkin figured he would make cheap quinine from coal tar and impress his teacher. They were basically the same, so it would be easy, right? Yeah\u2026 no. He never managed it. It is not certain exactly how the next even came to be, but after who knows how many tries to get oxygen to bond with the coal tar, he must have felt frustrated and out of options. I am guessing he got so exasperated he just tried whatever he could. Somehow, ethanol found its way into the coal tar. However\u2026 where the ethanol touched the coal tar, it turned a rich purple colour. Perkin sensed an opportunity, dipped a piece of cloth in and sent it to a silk manufacturer. The manufacturer replied that the colour was beautiful, and if it resisted fading well Perkin would be a rich man. William Henry Perkin had created the first synthetic dye. Within a few months of work Perkin, his brother and his friend had proven Perkin\u2019s father wrong and his father invested in his son\u2019s new business producing the dye, which they called mauveine. By the age of 36 Perkin was rich enough to retire. Perkin\u2019s invention of cheap synthetic was not groundbreakingly amazing just because it was the first synthetic dye, but because it changed people\u2019s, especially in England, views on chemistry. See, in the 1850\u2019s it was not really seen as a science but rather as something you dabbled in as a hobby. Perkin\u2019s invention convinced people that chemistry was a worthwhile economic career. Companies around the world were formed to identify and commercialise chemical synthesis. Now, many more people were driven to become chemists. This is why Perkin\u2019s accidental discovery is one of the world\u2019s most significant.

            "answer_text": "Penicillin, Quinine, Microwave, Velcro, Radioactivity, Smallpox vaccination, X-rays, Insulin, Viagra, Teflon, and Pacemaker are some. Even the Potato chip counts as an accidental discovery. But, for the very reason that each of the following saved more than a few million lives and each of them opened up a new vista in research in the respective field, the following are my eternal favorites: Quinine The story behind the chance discovery of the anti-malarial drug quinine may be more legend than fact, but it is nevertheless a story worthy of note. The account that has gained the most currency credits a South American Indian with being the first to find a medical application for quinine. According to legend, the man unwittingly ingested quinine while suffering a malarial fever in a jungle high in the Andes. Needing desperately to quench his thirst, he drank his fill from a small, bitter-tasting pool of water. Nearby stood one or more varieties of cinchona, which grows from Colombia to Bolivia on humid slopes above 5,000 feet. The bark of the cinchona, which the indigenous people knew as quina-quina, was thought to be poisonous. But when this man's fever miraculously abated, he brought news of the medicinal tree back to his tribe, which began to use its bark to treat malaria. Insulin Frederick G. Banting, a young Canadian doctor, and Professor John J.R. MacLeod of the University of Toronto shared a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their isolation and clinical use of insulin against diabetes. Their work with insulin followed from the chance discovery of the link between the pancreas and blood-sugar levels by two other doctors on the other side of the Atlantic decades earlier. Penicillin The identification of penicillium mold by Dr. Alexander Fleming in 1928 is one of the best-known stories of medical discovery. Penicillin has remained one of the most important and useful drugs in our arsenal, and its discovery triggered invaluable research into a range of other invaluable antibiotic drugs. Dr. Fleming had noticed that some mold had contaminated a flu culture in one of his petri dishes. Instead of throwing out the ruined dish, he decided to examine the moldy sample more closely. Fleming had reaped the benefits of taking time to scrutinize contaminated samples before. In 1922, Fleming had accidentally shed one of his own tears into a bacteria sample and noticed that the spot where the tear had fallen was free of the bacteria that grew all around it. After conducting some tests, he concluded that tears contain an antibiotic-like enzyme that could stave off minor bacterial growth. Six years later, the mold Fleming observed in his petri dish reminded him of this first experience with a contaminated sample. The area surrounding the mold growing in the dish was clear, which told Fleming that the mold was lethal to the potent staphylococcus bacteria in the dish. Later he noted, \"If for the previous experience, I would have thrown the plate away, as many bacteriologists have done before.\" Smallpox vaccination A young milkmaid had told Edward Jenner, a British scientist and surgeon in 1796, how people who contracted cowpox, a harmless disease easily picked up during contact with cows, never got smallpox, a deadly scourge. Inspired by this bit of information, Jenner took samples from the open cowpox sores on the hands of a young dairymaid named Sarah Nelmes and inoculated eight-year-old James Phipps with pus he extracted from Nelmes' sores. The boy developed a slight fever and a few lesions but remained unscathed. A few months later, Jenner gave the boy another injection, this one containing smallpox. James failed to develop the disease, and the idea behind the modern vaccine was born. Though doctors and scientists would not begin to understand the biological basis of immunity for at least 50 years after Jenner's first inoculation, the technique of vaccinating against smallpox using the human strain of cowpox soon became a common and effective practice worldwide.

While I believe that there have been notable discoveries that were found by people not originally intended to, most discoveries came about through a rigorous process called the scientific method. B. Admittedly, under some circumstances there were discoveries that were contributed by good fortune. The famous scientist Fleming discovered penicillin by accident, which had the ability to kill off bacteria. C. In the majority of cases, however, where careful planning and rigorous training were needed to come up with a significant discovery. Thomas Edison\u2019s invention of the light bulb was carefully planned. There is a famous quote saying that he did not fail at making a light bulb 700 times, he succeeded in knowing 1000 ways on how not to create a light bulb. Another supporting example involves Newton\u2019s law of gravity and Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which were conceive through careful experiment, numerous abstractions, and detailed calculations. Additionally, Mozart\u2019s and Beethoven musical creations were largely in part because they had studied music since a young age. The invention of the wheel and airplane were carefully thought out.

            "answer_text": "Ever wondered why your car windshield cracks but not shatter when exposed to shock/force ? Thank Edouard Benedictus, a French scientist for his clumsy mistake. One day at work, he knocked a glass flask to the floor. Although he heard the shatter, he found that the pieces still hung together maintaining the contour. On asking his assistant, he learnt that the bottle contained cellulose nitrate also known as liquid plastic. The content evaporated but left behind a layer of plastic coating insides of the flask preventing the glass from shattering. One week after this, newspapers in Paris ran an article about the rise in automobile accidents and how the drivers were severely injured by the shattered windshields. Edouard worked twenty-four hours straight to come up with his first Triplex (safety glass). But the automobile manufacturers were uninterested in the expensive safety glass. It was later used to coat the lenses for gas masks during World War 1. When the automobile manufacturers found the type of protection the lens had provided to the military personnel under extreme conditions of battle , they further examined and agreed to use them on windshields. 2. Imagine losing your natural crystalline lens in the eye to cataract and wearing high powered plus lenses like Professor Trelawney from Harry Potter. Disturbing isn\u2019t it?  Dr. Nicholas Harold Lloyd Ridley, an Ophthalmic surgeon in the World War 2, examined the eyes of Gordon Cleaver, a Royal Air Force Pilot whose eye was injured by plastic shards. He surprisingly found that the foreign body did not trigger any allergic reactions or rejections inside the pilot\u2019s eye.This observation and years of subsequent research led Dr. Ridley to perform a cataract surgery in 1949 where he replaced the natural cataractous crystalline lens with an artificial intraocular lens made of Perspex, in a highly controversial and daring surgery. Although it was angrily disputed initially, millions of cataract surgeries are performed to this day with intraocular lenses, bringing back people\u2019s vision and preventing blindness. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything we know about Roman antiquity (500 years of it) was discovered by accident. All information about laws during the reign of emperors as Hadrian or Marcus Aurelius is known due to the works of Gaius, the jurist. In the 19th Century, an Austro-Hungarian scientist was browsing through libraries of the Vatican searching for manuscripts from the 10th Century. Manuscripts were written on expensive parchment made of sheep skin, which were often reused several times. If certain passages became irrelevant, they were erased and something new was written there to reduce costs. On one page, the scientist saw scarcely visible remains of an erased text under the letters of another document. Upon further inspection, it turned out to be something incredible, never documented before: the work of Gaius. In order to make the erased text visible, chemicals were used, which, unfortunately, damaged the material and some ot the priceless information is lost forever. (At that time no computer analyses could be made to recover the damaged text.) Text that was found by accident that still survive has, nevertheless, lead us to many discoveries in Roman law and has expanded our knowledge of those times. ",

            "answer_text": "Are there any significant discoveries that were discovered by accident? Here\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t seen mentioned: gunpowder. Contrary to what some might believe, gunpowder has been around for over a millennium, and its discovery was one of the biggest flukes in human history. Unlike many other inventions (e.g. swords, wheels, spoons) - which were independently invented around the world by separate cultures - gunpowder was discovered exactly once, by accident, by people who were looking for something completely different: immortality, the ultimate goal of alchemists all over the world. Yes, gunpowder was accidentally discovered by a bunch of 9th century alchemists from the Tang Dynasty who were looking to create longevity-increasing drugs (i.e. the elixir of immortality) instead.[1] While they didn\u2019t find the secret to eternal life, the Chinese didn\u2019t fail to note that this stuff (which they called \u2018fire medicine\u2019, amusingly enough) was highly flammable and, if they could just tweak it a little bit more, highly explosive. Later on, the Song Dynasty[2] proceeded to use gunpowder weapons in their efforts to strengthen their control over the local tribes in the area. Soon after, they begin mass-producing weapons derived from it (mainly pole-grenades and pole-guns, useful in defending against siege-assaults; essentially proto-cannons). It didn't take long for these proto-cannons to reach India, where local warlords figured out ways to use it in their own wars, and eventually West Asia, where it was also popular for the same reasons. Eventually it reached Europe, where - you guessed it - it was also popular for the same reasons. Much of this spread is likely attributable to the Mongol conquests of Eurasia.

            "answer_text": "Hell yeah!    Guess what all these machines have in common? They wouldn\u2019t work without the magnetic effect of electric current, namely the principle by which flows of electric charges (i.e. electricity) generate a magnetic field in the surrounding space. The discovery of this phenomenon was groundbreaking, for it started a number of studies and experiments which, in turn, led to the revelation of other interactions[1] between electricity and magnetism, and eventually to the formulation of a unified electromagnetic theory. The traditional story goes as follows. Back on 21 April 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was setting up an apparatus he needed for a demonstration. In doing so he closed a switch (thus allowing current to flow in a circuit) and suddenly the needle of a nearby compass deflected from magnetic north. Electromagnetism had just been discovered. Lucky, uh? Well, to be fair, not as much as it might seem. At the time of Oersted\u2019s lecture, many physicists believed that a connection between electricity and magnetism was indeed there, yet nothing had been observed and some scientists thought otherwise; Oersted himself had conducted several unsuccessful experiments.[2] Also, chances are that Oersted\u2019s 1820 demonstration was intimately related to the subject (why would he have needed a battery and a compass, after all?), although this fact has no confirmation.[3] What\u2019s certain is that he definitely didn\u2019t expect such a thing to happen. So was it accidental? A bit, yes, but far from a mere coincidence. If Oersted\u2019s demonstration hadn\u2019t worked out the way it did, it\u2019s very likely that electromagnetism would\u2019ve been discovered anyway, shortly after. But at least, that way it was pretty cool. Footnotes[1] Electromagnetic induction - Wikipedia[2] Hans Christian \u00d8rsted - Wikipedia[3] July 1820: Oersted and electromagnetism",

            "answer_text": "I will tell you about two scientists Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov, known for their playful experiments accidentally discovered Graphene which got them Nobel Prize in physics. These two scientists were making an attempt to investigate the electrical properties of Graphite at the University of Manchester. They decided to investigate thinner flakes of Graphite and they used an unorthodox method to get thinner flakes of Graphite . For this they used sticky scotch tape. They used the tape to peel off a layer of Graphite from its block. Soon they realised that repeatedly sticking and peeling back the layer, they could get down to the thinnest layers of nearly one atom thick. This material (Graphene) has unique and interesting properties. So they both accidentally discovered a material today known as Graphene. It is the thinnest and the strongest material known to science, and it conducts electricity better than copper. Since its discovery has been made it has been the gateway for 2D electronics research and many more ground breaking research works using Graphene. Who knew that playing with a scotch tape on a afternoon would result in a discovery of Graphene which would have been impossible if not their for playfulness. So all that was required to win a Nobel prize was a scotch tape. Very unusual way to win a Nobel Prize. ",

Like any other day, Crum cooked some french fries for a customer; fries being a popular item on the menu. Except this customer wasn't satisfied with their fries; they were too thick. Crum had to redo them.  \"Whatever\", he's probably thinking. He redoes the order, making sure to cut the slices thinner, and sends out the order. No big deal right? Wrong. The customer isn't satisfied with the fries again. They're still too thick!  This time around, Crum's had enough of the nonsense. \"You want thin fries? I'll give you thin fries for sure.\" For the third time, cooking these stupid fries for the customer, Crum cuts the potato extremely thin; enough to see through the raw potato slices. He then fries the potato a little longer for good measure. In result he serves these things to the customer:  To his surprise, the customer very much enjoyed these \"fries\" and asked for more. The potato chip was born. Third time's a charm. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot! There are so many of them that if you tried to know all of them it will drain your phone\u2019s/laptop\u2019s battery. Speaking of which, have you ever wanted your battery to last longer or maybe for 400 years? Well, this can be a possibility now that a student have accidentally discovered a battery that lasts for 400 years. Last April 2016, in search for an alternative to the lithium battery, Mya Le Thai, a doctoral candidate at UC Irvine, was \u201cplaying around\u201d and coated a gold nanowire in manganese dioxide and encased it in an electrolyte gel (that interacts with the coating to avoid corrosion), which then resulted to the invention of the battery. Compared to nanowires in lithium-ion batteries that usually grow brittle after limited use, Thai\u2019s battery can withstand approximately 200,000 charges and can last up to 400 years. Although researchers don\u2019t understand the exact mechanism of the battery yet, this discovery could lead to a major change in technology. [Edit: the \u201cplaying around\u201d bit is quoted from Reginald Penner(lead author of a paper on the research published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s Energy Letters):\u201cMya was playing around, and she coated this whole thing with a very thin gel layer and started to cycle it\u2026\u201d] ",

            "answer_text": "Popsicles! In 1905, a boy named Frank Epperson mixed soda powder with water and left it outside. The next morning, he discovered that his mixture had frozen. He devoured his accidental ice pop and was awestruck by the overnight transformation. After discovering that it was a huge hit with his friends, he sold it around his neighborhood and at nearby amusement parks. Later, he patented his invention. By that time, he had children who used to refer to his ice pops as \u201cPop\u2019s sicles,\u201d so he named his brand \u201cPopsicle.\u201d The story didn\u2019t end well for Epperson, though. He was living in poverty and ended up selling his patent (to a company which ended up making huge profits). But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I owe several childhood memories to an 11-year-old who left a glass of soda out on his front porch.  ",

This health resort followed a strict vegetarian diet for their patients. One day, John Harvey Kellogg, and his younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg left some cooked wheat to sit while they attended to a matter that required their attention. By the time they returned, the wheat had gone stale. As they were on a strict budget, they tried to roll it into a dough. To their surprise, they found flakes. They toasted the flakes and served it to their patients. This happened on August 8, 1894. In 1898 they tried the same process using corn and \"corn flakes\" was born. Weird fact - Corn flakes was originally invented in the hopes that it would reduce dyspepsia, stop people from pleasuring themselves and indulging in \u201cphysical activity\u2019. ",

It incorporated a synthetic dichroic substance called herapathite or quinine sulfate periodide. It is the widely used polariser. (Dichroic materials absorb one of two plane-polarized components of transmitted light more strongly than the other. Hence they can be used as polarisers ) H. Land in one of his text wrote about how the discovery of the material herapathite made. . . . There was once this physcian named William Bird Herapath. a physician in Bristol. England. whose pupil, a Mr. Phelps. Once a dog ate some Quinine and peed(WHY??? Answer:DOGS will be DOGS) Then Mr Phelps did a weird thing. He dropped iodine on the dog pee. O.o (At this point i won\u2019t even ask why\u2026) Little green crystals were formed. He immediately told his mentor Mr Herapath who rightfully and consiously put the dog pee inside the microscope. He looked at the crystals under the microscope and noticed that in some place they were light where they overlapped and in some places they were dark. He was shrewd enough to recognize that here was a remarkable phenomenon. A new polarising material [now known as herapathite]\u2026 . . . As much as i was in awe about the discovery, it left me with more questions about the discovery than the answers. ",

            "answer_text": "An entire underground city.  Imagine knocking down one of your house\u2019s walls and finding a mysterious room behind it. Well that\u2019s what one man did in the 1960s, and when he dug further, he discovered there was a tunnel. He followed it, and discovered an entire underground city! Almost eighteen levels, full of labyrinths, staircases and hidden paths. Derinkuyu Underground City is located in the Cappadocian region of Turkey, and is the deepest of the thirty-six underground cities located there. The underground city was used as protection against the Muslim Arabs during the Arab-Byzantine Wars that took place between the 7th and 11th centuries, and continued to be used as a refuge by Christians as recently as 1909, during the Adana massacre. Following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, the underground cities were left abandoned and in the case of Derinkuyu, forgotten.  It\u2019s believed to have held a population as large as 20,000 and was fully equipped, having stalls, ventilation shafts, kitchens, food stores, wine and oil presses, wells and even a school:  It\u2019s truly a portal to another time:  and was extremely well-protected against threats. Each level has escape routes, so nobody trying to flee an invasion would ever get trapped, and massive stone doors were used to close off and protect the inhabitants on each level:  ",

Clue - 3  This graph shows consumption of \u201cit\u201d in a year. Clue - 4 The following shows the consumption of \u201cIt\u201d per year per person. Finland: 9.6 kg per capitaNorway: 7.2 kg per capitaNetherlands 6.7 kg per capitaSlovenia: 6.1 kg per capitaAustria: 5.5 kg per capitaSerbia: 5.4 kg per capitaDenmark: 5.3 kg per capitaGermany: 5.2 kg per capitaBelgium: 4.9 kg per capitaBrazil: 4.8 kg per capitaClue - 5 Consumption of \u201cit\u201d 5\u201310 kg per year. Hmm.. Pretty significant. Clue - 6 Market of \u201cIt\u201d is 18 bn.$. in U.S. alone. ****Cha-ching**** Clue - 7 Number of stores to sell \u201cIt\u201d :  So\u2026 Any guesses?? What \u201cIt\u201d is which was discovered by accident? . . . . . . . . . It is coffee. Transforming \u201cyawns\u201d to \u201cyaaaay\u201d since hundreds of years.  A popular legend has it that the first to enjoy the magical effects of coffee was a goat. Seriously !!!!  One day, hundreds of years ago, Kaldi, an Ethiopian goatherd, noticed a change in the behavior of his goats. Kaldi observed that the goats were being unusually cheerful and energetic, so he followed them around. Turns out, the goats had been devouring the beans and leaves of a particular tree. Curious, Kaldi consumed some of them, too, and also gave some to a monk that was having trouble staying awake throughout prayers. The monks loved the new drink because of its galvanizing effect and good taste ",

            "answer_text": "Can you imagine a surgery being done without anaesthesia? Imagine yourself on the OT table lying consciously and watching the surgeon opening your abdomen...... (crying out for relief) The immense pain one gets during this period is unbearable. Sounds scary , isn't it? . .All credits goes to this man , who laid basis for painless field in surgery.  He is British Chemist Sir Humphry Davy. In 1799 , Humphry Davy, began a very radical bout of self experimentation to determine the effects of inhaling various gases at Pneumatic Institute . He realized that as a preliminary step he would need to establish which gases could be inspired without causing serious injury.  He began his experimentation with inhalation of carbon dioxide produced from ammonia and bicarbonate. He described the effects as difficulty in drawing air (laryngospasm). Later , he experimented with 60 % CO2 and rest air , which produced giddiness. Subsequently , he also tried experimentation with CO and H2 , the effects of which were also described very unpleasant. After repeated unpleasant experiences with various gases , he decided to give a try at nitrous oxide , the gas which killed the mice in the experiments of Joseph Priestley. Assisted by his assistant Dr. Kinglake , he dared to give it a try. To his surprise , the effects of the gas were highly pleasurable. On inhalation , he had an euphoric experience with trains of vivid visible images rapidly passing through his mind . To enjoy the effects , he started inhaling it on regular basis. He also recommended this to his friends and family. One day , he had a dental extraction and was in great pain. He decided to inhale the gas. He was amazed as he was totally relieved of the pain. His words after consumption of the gas. \"The power of the immediate operation of the gas in removing intense physical pain, I had a very good opportunity of ascertaining. In cutting one of the unlucky teeth called dentes sapientiae, I experienced an extensive inflammation of the gum, accompanied with great pain, which equally destroyed the power of repose and of consistent action. On the day when the inflammation was most troublesome, I breathed three large doses of nitrous oxide. The pain always diminished after the first four or five inspirations; the thrilling came on as usual, and uneasiness was for a few minutes swallowed up in pleasure.\" . . Based on his experiences , he hypothesized that nitrous oxide could relive any pain. It took 50 long years for his accidental finding to get recognised . Thanks for scrolling.

The inventor of the Coca-Cola, John Pemberton, did not exactly intend to strike it rich by being the actual creator of the most popular and biggest-selling soft drink in history, and additionally, one of the most well-known and recognizable brands in the entire world. He simply wanted to find a solution to headaches. Pemberton used coca leaves and kola nuts, which were his two main components for making the drink. But, his lab assistant mixed the two ingredients together with carbonated water accidentally, and the result was a Coke. Unfortunately, John Pemberton died two years later, and never got to witness his very basic concoction become so popular and appreciated. ",

            "answer_text": "An unexpected and amazing historical discovery took place recently in Iznic lake in Turkey.  Beautiful aerial pics reveal that a 1600 year old church discovered below the Lake Iznik. This became visible due to recent lockdown imposed in Turkey amid COVID19 resulting the crystal clear water of the lake.  Archeologist says that the historical church was collapsed during a huge earthquake in 740AD and gradually submerged in the lake.  The submerged building presently lies between 1.5 to 2 metres below the surface and is clearly seen, because the corona lockdown has resulted in less pollution and turned the water of the Iznic lake less polluted.  Experts believe it had been built in AD 390, to honour the St. Neophytos, who was given capital punishment in the time of Roman emperors Diocletian and Galerius. He was killed just near the bank of Iznik lake where the church was built in memory of him.  It is assumed that the church was built on the collapsed temple of Apollo. In that time the lake was known as Nicea.  Researchers have uncovered fragments of Apollo temple and believe that an additional historic structure may buried below the structure of the church. This is an amazing incident as the contemporary has got a chance to talk with its past amid COVID 19. Photo Source: Google For more like this article please visit Interesting Articles !

            "answer_text": "Another great story is Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanized rubber. Goodyear have been experimenting with natural rubber (latex and India Rubber) for five years.  He was broke, his family dependant on charity, and still kept trying.   The great discovery came in the winter of 1839. Goodyear was using various powders, including sulphur, in his experiments to make rubber less sticky. One February day he wandered into Woburn\u2019s general store to show off his latest gum-and-sulphur formula. Snickers rose from the men in the store, and the usually mild-mannered little inventor got excited, waved his sticky fistful of gum in the air. It flew from his fingers and landed on the sizzling-hot potbellied stove.   When he went to clean up the melted mess, he discovered it was not melted at all.  He pulled it off in one piece and found that it was still flexible, like rubber, but was now hard enough to hold its shape and not at all sticky. After more experiments to refine the cooking process he filed patents and rubber companies began paying royalties.  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. was named for his type of rubber, but was never owned by anyone in the Goodyear family. ",

            "answer_text": "It must be sticky note.  I think It\u2019s one of the most significant innovations, which change the way people use to learn or memorize things. But few people know how it was invented. In 1968,Dr. Spencer Silver, a scientist at 3M in the United States, was attempting to develop a kinda superglue. But accidentally, he created a a \"low-tack,\" reusable, pressure-sensitive adhesive. Whilst 5 years after that, he promoted his invention within 3M but failed to get accepted. A year later, a coworker came up with the idea of using that glue as a bookmark. The original \u201cbookmark\u201d was yellow due to only left yellow scrap paper there in the lab-next-door. Although it wasn\u2019t quite successed at its debut, Silver found the new potential of note as the new type of communicating of organnize. Then, The profit rapidly grew. And It opened the door of new art. ",

            "answer_text": "The ice cream cone!  The invention of the ice cream cone is fascinating. Here is the back story. Back in 1904 the St. Louis World Fair took place. There were many vendors selling various items. One of the more popular purchases was ice cream. However one of the ice cream vendors ran into a problem. Because of the ice cream\u2019s popularity, he ran out of dishes! But guess what happened next? An immigrant from Syria, Ernest A. Hamwi, was selling a crisp waffle life pastry- called zalabis- in a booth right next to the ice cream vendor. Realizing the problem, he quickly came up with a brilliant solution. He quickly rolled up his wafer-like waffles in a shape of cone, and he gave it to the ice cream vendor. The vendor then put ice cream inside the cone, the customers were satisfied, and the invention we now call the waffle cone was born!  Thanks for reading! idfa.org ",

            "answer_text": "The Burning Bush from the Bible. Moses, a shepherd, was looking for one of his lost sheep around Mt. Sinai when he stumbled upon a cave. There was light coming from the inside, which was quite odd. To add to the mystery, wisps of smoke were also coming out of the cave. Something was ablaze inside. Once he entered, he saw a burning bush\u2026of marijuana.  Upon inhaling the fumes, he got high by accident and \u2018saw God\u2019. He heard voices as well. This made him take off his sandals, for he was tripping balls at this point. The hallucinations enabled him to realize he was the chosen one to rescue his fellow Israelites from the Egyptians. It is possible that this same weed enabled Moses to believe that he was capable of doing miraculous feats, such as separating an entire sea in half or turning his staff into a snake. This is how Moses discovered weed. However, it is not known how marijuana was capable of growing in such altitudes and climate. Also, no one knows how the bush was set on fire inside the cave. God\u2019s will, maybe? \u0295\u2022\ufecc\u2022\u0294 ",

            "answer_text": "The discovery of the nueron was an accident. Camille Golgi accidently spilled black die over a sample of tissue from the brain of an owl. A few days later he observed the tissue. He noticed distinct cells that absorbed the black die. He also noticed an organelle that absorbed the die, the Golgi Apparatus (and thus the name Golgi). The discovery led to the formation of several theories. He creates his own theory in which he believed neurons were not individual cells, instead they were one large cell. However, this was proven wrong when a space between synapses was discovered and cell theory was formed as a result. All in all the accidental discovery was a breakthrough. Additionally, I'm sure you know of this but penicillin was created accidentally. Fleming was experimenting with the influenza virus in the Laboratory of the Inoculation Department at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London. Often described as a careless lab technician, Fleming returned from a two-week vacation to find that a mold had developed on an accidentally contaminated staphylococcus culture plate. Upon examination of the mold, he noticed that the culture prevented the growth of staphylococci. ",

            "answer_text": "Chocolate chip cookies!  In 1938, Ruth Graves Wakefield was a chef who owned and worked at the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts. At the time, the Inn was a popular restaurant, well-known for its delicious home-style cooking. One day, Wakefield was making a batch of chocolate cookies, when she found that she was out of baker\u2019s chocolate. She was in a rush and didn\u2019t have time to go out and buy more, so she chopped up a regular chocolate bar into small pieces and tossed it into the batter, hoping that it would melt and spread evenly through the cookies. Obviously, it didn\u2019t go as she\u2019d wanted it to, and she ended up with cookies with gooey chunks of chocolate scattered throughout: the chocolate chip cookies we know and love today! ",

One night , after a day of laboratory work, Fahlberg sat down to dinner. He picked up a roll with his hand and bit into a remarkably sweet crust. Fahlberg had literally brought his work home with him, having spilled an experimental compound over his hands earlier that day. He ran back to Remsen\u2019s laboratory, where he tasted everything on his worktable\u2014all the vials, beakers, and dishes he used for his experiments. Finally he found the source: an overboiled beaker in which o-sulfobenzoic acid had reacted with phosphorus (V) chloride and ammonia, producing benzoic sulfinide. Though Falhberg had previously synthesized the compound by another method, he had no reason to taste the result. Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880. In 1884, then working on his own in New York City, Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin. Serendipity had provided him with the first commercially viable alternative to cane sugar. Source : The Pursuit of Sweet ",

The French scientist Antoine Henri Becquerel was investigating the properties of uranium salts and had made the hypotesis that they emitted X-rays when exposed to light; to test it he put a sample on a photographic plate closed in its sleeve and exposed to sunlight. Sure enough, when he developed the plate he found a bright image in the shape of the uranium sample. He repeated the test for reproducibility, but unfortunately the sun got clouded shortly thereafter. He developed the plate expecting to find little or no image, but he found one every bit as bright as the first one. From this he inferred the existence of a peculiar \u201cradiation\u201d emitted by the uranium per se, a notion that got him to share the Nobel prize with the Curies. ",

The site and several miles around it was prepared to record video and data of the explosion, predicted to have a yield of 6 megatons of TNT. The bomb used Lithium as the fusion fuel. Lithium-6 and Lithium-7 to be precise. At the time of the test, Lithium-7, more common than Lithium-6, was assumed to be inert. Because Lithium-6 is hard to extract, the bomb went out with 40% L-6 and the rest L-7. When the bomb was detonated it had a yield of 15 Megatons of TNT, 2.5 times more powerful than predicted. That\u2019s how scientists learned Lithium-7 is not inert as they thought.  ",

On May 20 1964 American radio astronomers Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), the ancient light that began saturating the universe 380,000 years after its creation. And they did so pretty much by accident. At first when they picked up the odd buzzing sound from their antennas, and thought that the noise was from pigeon shit and others factors, but only after eliminating every possible source of noise they realized that they found something big then they hoped for.  In their own words \"When we first heard that inexplicable 'hum,' we didn\u2019t understand its significance, and we never dreamed it would be connected to the origins of the universe,\" Penzias said in a statement. \"It wasn\u2019t until we exhausted every possible explanation for the sound's origin that we realized we had stumbled upon something big.\" The two radio astronomers won the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics for their work, sharing the award with Soviet scientist Pyotr Kapitsa. Surprisingly the static noise we used to see in old analog TV\u2019s (at least some of the noise) were due to CMB from the outer space.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written before: Crazy Glue (Cyanoacrylate) The original patent for cyanoacrylate was filed in 1942 by the B.F. Goodrich Company as an outgrowth of a search for materials suitable for clear plastic gun sights for the war effort. In 1942, a team of scientists headed by Harry Coover Jr. stumbled upon a formulation that stuck to everything with which it came in contact. The team quickly rejected the substance for the wartime application, but in 1951, while working as researchers for Eastman Kodak, Coover and a colleague, Fred Joyner, rediscovered cyanoacrylates. The two realized the true commercial potential, and a form of the adhesive was first sold in 1958 under the title \"Eastman #910\" (later \"Eastman 910\"). (Wikipedia) (emphasis added)",

            "answer_text": " In 1928 Sir Alexander Fleming, a professor of bacteriology, noticed mould had started to grow on his petri dishes of Staphylococcus bacteria colonies. While looking for the colonies he could salvage from those infected with the mould, he noticed something intriguing. Bacteria wasn't growing around the mould. The mould actually turned out to be a rare strain of Penicillin notatum that secreted a substance that inhibited bacterial growth.  In 1859, 22-year-old chemist Robert Chesebrough was investigating an oil well in Pennsylvania when he caught wind of a strange rumour among the oil rig workers: a jelly-like substance known as \"rod wax\" that constantly got into the machines and caused them to malfunction. But the substance had a good side, too. Chesebrough noticed that the workers used rod wax to soothe cuts and burns on their skin, and he took some home to experiment with. The product of his experimentation was what we know today as petroleum jelly, or Vaseline. [1] Footnotes[1] Chesebrough Manufacturing Company",

Many Unintended Scientific Discoveries DuPont chemist Roy Plunkett was at work on a new chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant in 1938 when he changed the lives of cooks everywhere. Testing different chemical reactions, he accidentally discovered a new polymer called polytetrafluoroethylene, but you know it better as Teflon.In the early 1990s, Pfizer was testing out a drug called UK92480, intended to treat patients with angina, a common precursor to heart attacks, involving the constriction of blood vessels that supply the heart. The company was hoping the drug would relax the blood vessels. Mm, it failed in that regard, but test subjects reported some fascinating developments below the belt, and so became the little blue pill known as Viagra, a side effect of which is\u2014wait for it\u2014heart attacks.In 1907, Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland was trying to find a replacement for shellac\u2014that's an expensive resin secreted by a South Asian beetle\u2014when instead he produced the world's first plastic.Many more can be read at the url below.Source http://mentalfloss.com/article/53646/24-important-scientific-discoveries-happened-accident",

They  were having  a devil of a time trying to stop the noise on the microwave antennas.  This story is well told in both new and old Cosmos series. By chance they stumbled onto actual physicists wanting to detect the background radiation at Princeton including Dr. Dicke who famously quipped to his colleagues : \"Boys, we've been scooped.\" ",

Through an electrochemical process that uses tiny spikes of carbon and copper, scientists have been able to convert the harmful greenhouse gas into useful fuel. In a press release published on the institution\u2019s website, Adam Rondinone, lead author of the team\u2019s study, said, \u201cWe discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked\u2026 We were trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we realised that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its own.\u201d  The team of scientists have published their findings in ChemistrySelect, a science journal, where details of the process are explained. The process relies on low-cost materials and can be carried out at room temperature. The researchers hope that the process will soon find industrial usage. \u201cEthanol was a surprise \u2014 it\u2019s extremely difficult to go straight from carbon dioxide to ethanol with a single catalyst,\u201d Adam said.

The young boy was a glasses wearer who was riding his bicycle. He fell off, the glasses shattered, and glass lodged in his eyes. To save the boy\u2019s eyesight, Dr. Fyodorov made radial slits in his cornea and dug the glass out. A few days later, he removed the bandages. The boy could see perfectly without his glasses, so he tried it on more people and got the same result: the patient\u2019s vision improved greatly. ",

Your zip code plays a huge role in many situations - most which are unaware to you.Some people don't like you and will never like you ; some people don't like you but can be persuaded to like you ; some people do like you and will always like you ; some people like you and can be persuade to really dislike you - I've found out that sometimes all these 4 people can be part of you family.

As in everyday social life, confirmation is exactly the absence of insight. In science, as in life, dramatic new discoveries must almost by definition be accidental (\u201cserendipitous\u201d).

The solid PTFE unexpectedly stretched about 800%, forming a microporous structure that was about 70% air. X-rays - Wikipedia (X-ray - Wikipedia) R\u00f6ntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. R\u00f6ntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. R\u00f6ntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper. ",

According to the previous classical mechanics it was an accident that the speed of light is the same in every direction. A lot of discoveries get classed as accidents if you count that. Radioactivity is more accidental. Someone noticed that uranium and thorium samples stored on photographic plates ruined those plates. Those plates could have been thrown out instead of investigated by the Curies. ",
