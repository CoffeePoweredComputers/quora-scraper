            "answer_text": "NCERT is 70% sufficient. This is what I usually recommend to all my students for chemistry : Chemistry: NCERT most important. Other than that, for reference, use OP Tandon, MS Chouhan, Pradeeps, Morrison and Boyd, Himanshu Pandey, P Bahadur, SN Sanyal etc Practice previous year IIT JEE questions MANY TIMES (You can use Arihant 39 years for that ! ) . Become perfect in them. Solve other people\u2019s doubts. These will help you score better :). People run after so many modules and crap test series. Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times !! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them. Self study is definitely most important. But coaching really helps you score more Mantra: Arise awake and stop not till the goal is reached :) ~Swami Vivekananda Best Wishes :)  ",
