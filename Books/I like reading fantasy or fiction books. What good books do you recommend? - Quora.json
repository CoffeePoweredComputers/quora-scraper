            "answer_text": "Fantasy/fiction is a quite gigantic genre. A \"good\" book will depend on your choice of sub-genre. I mainly like Epic Fantasy (different world, huge books and often, complicated plots) but I have read some other books as well. Epic Fantasy/High Fantasy: The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson : Dark, violent and not centered on one character with mortals trapped in the games of Gods.Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson: An ongoing epicInheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini: Please do not judge the series by the horrible movie. It is a pretty great book.Traveller's Gate by Will Wight: Intense action, cool magic systemUrban Fantasy: Bartimaeus Sequence by Jonathan Stroud: Funny, great storyPercy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick RiordanArtemis Fowl by Eoin ColferThe Secrets of Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Michael ScottVicious by V E Schwab: Unlike many other books in urban fantasy, this is more of an adult read. It is a bit darker than other novels in this category.Science Fiction: Night's Dawn Trilogy by Peter F HamiltonHyperion Cantos by Dan SimmonsI have purposefully avoided the widely popular books like Harry Potter or A Song of Ice and Fire as they are already known to be \"good\". I would suggest you to use Goodreads for book recommendations as their suggestions include books similar to what you have liked or what other readers who have read that book liked. It also automatically removes the kinds of books you are not interested in once you mark some books of that kind as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Tropical Night Falling by Manuel Puig.  Manuel Puig is best known, I'd say, for cleverness. He writes these intricate experimental novels entirely in dialogue, and yet they are some of the most readable exciting books you'll ever have the pleasure of picking up. He's a master of plot and humor and all the things that make any novel not just great but fun, and yet if his books are a mile wide they're 10 miles deep. Every single one is just dripping in theory and politics and psychology and pop culture, and his integration of all that into very real feeling dialogue is just kind of mind boggling.  The first book of his anyone/everyone should read is Kiss of the Spider Woman. It opens with two prisoners narrating movies they've seen to eachother to pass the time. I won't reveal more than that. But it's an incredibly exciting book in pretty much every way, and laugh out loud funny, and poignant, and technically masterful. It's his best known book, you might've read it in a 20th century fiction class in college. So it's a great introduction to him as an author, and I think it's worth getting to know him a little before tropical night falling.  Tropical Night Falling is the last book he wrote before he died (in like the mid 80s I think), and it's these two old women in Rio gossiping about their neighbors on the porch. Not quite as attention grabbing as the opening scene of Spider Woman, but that's kind of the point. This is Puig in full humble control of his talents, with nothing to prove, so it's a novel about the daily drama of aging and loss and human concern for one another, our dependence on eachother and on shared hopes, maybe shared delusions even. It's beautifully calm somehow even as it makes the everyday riveting and suspenseful. Just such a compassionate gorgeous novel. ",
