But then also he worked and worked on himself As Sachin said about converting stones thrown at you int milestones similarly you have to convert the 200 marks you are scoring right now into your dream - 500 For this you need 3 things to reach 500+ score Smart workDedicationStrategy planned and executed wellYou know about 1st two. I am gonna explain the last point to you in detail manner STRATEGY PLANNED AND EXECUTED WELL As you are giving mocks so now analyse those mocks. Sit with a pen and paper and write down which chapter questions you did wrongHave a look at the last 5\u20136 mocks you have given and see which chapter questions you are doing continuously wrong.Now look at the NEET 2020 Analysis and see which all chapters carried how many weightage.Now compare this with the list you made about your weak chapters and see which all are commonWork on those chapters firstHow will this help you? - By working on those chapters first which have very high chances of question to be asked, you are ensuring full marks if attempt correctly. This will help you to reach your target for 500+ from 200 Do only few chapters which have very high weightage instead of doing every chapter as it will help you only. Remember -Sachin also used to get out on 0 and sometimes 99 but this didn\u2019t stopped him from becoming the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket Believe, you can easily do it Best of luck to every NEET aspirant ",

            "answer_text": "Mock tests certainly don't define where you would stand in the final exam. First of all, make sure that the test series you chose is of NEET level. I personally recommend Allen test series. But it seems that you are already enrolled in some test series, make sure that you do NCERT based questions correctly (mainly for Biology). In Physics and chemistry, do analyse PYQs of NEET to know what is being asked. Understand the concept needed to solve Q's that went wrong in tests. Write them somewhere. Make a mistakes register where you write your silly and conceptual mistakes. Revise it daily. All the best \ud83d\udc4d ",
