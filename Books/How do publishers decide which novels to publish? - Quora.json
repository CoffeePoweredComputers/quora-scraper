            "answer_text": "Hello there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. Approaching a traditional publisher with your manuscript does not meant that they will automatically decide to publish your book. They have a strict policy towards ensuring quality of the books they publish and reject more than 90% of the manuscripts submitted to them. For first time authors, it becomes even harder to get a traditional publishing contract due to a perceived risk of publishing a relatively unknown name. Traditional publishers also take a considerable amount of time to get back to authors since they get bombarded with hundreds of manuscripts. The usual process is that once you submit your manuscript it goes to the editorial team of that publisher, who will then take their time to review the manuscript. The editorial team then evaluates the script based on a number of criteria like Writing Style, Uniqueness of story, Authors Profile, etc. Each publisher has their own set of criteria they look at before deciding on publishing the book. Some of the bet selling authors around the world have all faced multiple rejections from publishers. Even JK Rowling was rejected by 12 publishing houses before Bloomsbury gave Harry Potter a read. If you are a first time author or if you've been rejected by a publisher before don't lose hope. You could subsequently approach a self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press Publishing and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and help you bring your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. To know more about how this works you can check out the website link given above. Your other option would be to publish it by yourself by using platforms like KDP or Createspace. This would essentially require you to take care of every aspect of publishing ie. cover design, interior formatting, editing etc by yourself. Such platforms are mostly free to use and take a commission from each book sale and pay out a percentage of the profits in terms of royalty. ",

            "answer_text": "This won't be universal and I'm not discussing novels, but since I am quite focused on the personal in selecting books to publish, you might see that all such decisions are likely to have elements that aren't strictly logical. There is always some serendipity in selecting any books, but the combination of criteria and fundamentals will be there somehow. I have two criteria for Bite-Sized Books, once the fundamentals have been met and those fundamentals are: Length - less than 10k wordsStyle - conversational and anecdotalBased on successful experience and only focused on what has made the writer successful.The criteria, which are not required to be both there, for commissioning or accepting a typescript are: Is the book able to inspire, or at least alter the perception of, the readerDoes this book open up a new way of approaching the subject - not just business but lifestyle and public affairs?As I said, highly specific to me, but actually when I had books accepted for publication I suspect these were elements in the publisher\u2019s decision and you can extrapolate the criteria to novels quite easily.
