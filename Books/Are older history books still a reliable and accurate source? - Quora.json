            "answer_text": "That kind of depends on a lot of variables. If you\u2019re reading about a certain period in a certain region, it can be very helpful to read books from that place and time, if you can find them. If you ever look at old maps compared to newer ones, you can see that there are countries now that didn\u2019t exist fifty years ago, and others that haven\u2019t existed in hundreds of years. Suppose you want to read about one of those vanished countries. You\u2019ll want to find books written in the time that country existed, by people who lived there. You will also find books written by the people of the country that replaced the vanished one. These are likely to give you two very different perspectives on what happened there. To get a better picture of what really happened, you\u2019ll want to try to find other things that were written at the same time, not only by the people of the country that vanished and the people of the country that replaced it. Look for things written by other people in the region who watched it from outside, as it were. From any of these people, if you can find almost any kinds of documents from the time, such as diaries, letters, or legal documents, you\u2019ll get a better picture of what life was like in that place and time than you might from a book that was written hundreds of years later. You can also look for more recent books whose authors have found and researched those old documents. The age of the book doesn\u2019t matter as much as the source material from which it was written. Was it written by someone who was there at the time, either living through the events in question or watching it as it happened? Was it written by the people who lost the war, or by those who won? Was it written generations later, based on \u201cwhat my grandpappy told me\u201d, and was grandpappy there at the time, or did he hear about it from someone else? Was it written more recently, by someone who found the diary of a soldier in that long-ago war, or the letters between family members who found themselves on opposite sides? I bet you didn\u2019t think the answer to your question would be quite so complicated. History is a rabbit hole; enjoy exploring it. :-) ",
