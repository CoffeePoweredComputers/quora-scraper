            "answer_text": "Most of what happened in the show was fictional based on real characters of which we know little or nothing about. For instance we know there was a character named Oenomaus who was a gladiator and became one of the leaders of the rebellion before vanishing without any noted reason. The extent of our knowledge of him is former gladiator that was one of the leaders of the rebellion who disappeared shortly after the rebellion started. From that the show built the character of Doctore, made him an African (he was most likely Gallic), and gave him a story that involved his originals, role in the rebellion, and death. This is true for all the characters that are based on real historical figures. As my favorite historical fiction author states, the job of a historical novelist is to tell a story, not history. They take the historical setting and the historical characters and use them to tell an entertaining story while sticking as closely to the historical narrative as possible. The show did a decent job of that. ",
