            "answer_text": "Hi Shweta, To have a good reading speed is like a boon in the world of exams and tests. Before I tell you how to improve your reading speed, I would like you to take out your current reading speed. This will help us to set the goal of 200 Word per minute. The technique is very basic and simple. If you are studying in 10th grade take any grade-appropriate reader ( should be a literature or language reader ) if you over 18, take any newspaper or magazine ( column page )choose the text you have not read before.Time yourself for three minutes.start reading the text ( if possible do not read aloud )After three minutes, stop and count the number of words you have read.divide the words by three ( suppose if you have read 150 words in three minutes, your score will be 50 wpm )Now your job is to reach 200 WPM.Now comes the strategy part, means how to increase the speed. Please take the grade-appropriate text.Suppose you are an adult and passed out the college or still studying in the college. I will suggest the newspapers or magazines are the best for you. Take the OPed column which you generally find on the third or fourth page of the newspaper. Or the magazines ( a reputed for its content ). Any good literary fiction book will also do. And if you are a student then the problem is solved, take your grade reader.2. After selecting the text, please time yourself and read for three minutes. Count the number of words and divide them into three. 3. Do this for 8 weeks. 4. Keep the diary and mark your score every day. While reading, do the practice of chunking like when we read we do tend to read one or two words at a time. For example I want to improve my reading speed and do very well in the exams. this is the sentence, some people chunk like this \u2014\u2014 I want / to / improve / my reading/ speed and/ do very/ well/ in the / exams. //////// these slanting suggest the chunking and it hampers your speed. There are nine chunks happened while reading that sentence. I would recommend you to increase the chunking like this. I want to improve / my reading speed / and do very well /in the exams. In the above sentence, there are only four chunks and it surely helps us in improving our reading speed. Any standard book may have 12 to 14 words on its line. ( the words limit varies according to the text so the best way is to increase your chunking. The fastest reader always expands its chunking. I hope this will help you to be a good reader. Please let me know if these strategies have worked out well with you. Any doubts please feel free to contact me. Golden Tip: Before reading anything, tell yourself what you are going to read or why you are going to read. Your brain quickly starts cooperating with you and the best result will be displayed. Thanks a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "We have a tendency of pronouncing words in our minds while we read or write. And this habit results in consuming a lot of time and reduces our reading speed. You can increase your reading speed by not repeating the words that you read, in your head for a second time. This is a valid trick that I read in a book. Hope this helps! ",
