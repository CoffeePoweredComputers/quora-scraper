In an old fashioned catalog, these would be found at the bottom of the catalog card. With automation, they are still there, but at the end of the record. While working in the Public Library, I helped many Patrons with these searches. Most come from adults trying to trace books read as children, wanting to share to share them with new generations. I am not familiar with Wattpad. I must update. ",

You can narrow it down by genre or character names as well. I am not sure if Wattpad has the feature of reading history, but you can look for the book in your activities as well. ",
