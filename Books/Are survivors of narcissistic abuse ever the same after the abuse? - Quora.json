            "answer_text": "Are survivors of narcissistic abuse ever the same after the abuse? Do you think you\u2019d ever be the same after you just got raped? Do you think you\u2019d ever be the same after you just got beaten the crap out of. Do you think you\u2019d ever be the same after spending years being tortured mentally. \u201cDoubt it\u201d After many years being mentally abused your mind starts to shut down and then every single thing they say becomes meaningless & nothing has any true meaning behind it. You don\u2019t believe anything that they say after a while because their words do not even come close to matching their actions. That abuse takes it\u2019s toll on your body, your mind, your spiritual life, & your soul cannot take that indescribable mental pain that they can dish in your direction. I promise you that your life will never even being close to the same once you\u2019re intimate with a Narcy. That toxic relationship has an overdue date and that overdue dates about to expire. When you think you\u2019ve had enough crap from this so called abuser. That\u2019s when you decide to walk and call it quits. When you call it quits, that\u2019s when the abuse stops. Or at least you hope it does. But are you ever going to be the same? No, you will not be the same again. Nothing will be normal to you again. You are pretty much ruined and lost to a crazy point that death doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea to visit. Just so you can find some kinda internal peace within yourself and be able to breathe a little easier. It takes time to heal from this abuse and it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes years to come back and some people do not ever come back. Thank you for this question, Dane Staton ",

After spending most of my life surrounded by narcissistic parents and psychopaths I\u2019ll never be the same. After your mind is numb and filled with negative self criticism and self doubt, depression hits you and your subconscious mind lashes out your worst nightmares\u2026 You are labelled as crazy and mentally unstable by your ex narcissistic friend so your real friends start walking away from you and obviously, they don\u2019t care about you because the f**** narcissist has made a bad reputation to you to all those people that knew you before. No, you never be the same person because now you see the world as the place that really is: filled with soulless people trying to feed their spirit and ego with the light of the empath that you are\u2026Filled with sociopaths willing to commit atrocities in order to succeed in their field or personal lives. No, I\u2019ll never be the same. People are full of sh*t. My ancestors still protecting me from idk what because by all the situations and all the disgusting ppl I\u2019ve met I really believe there must be something special within me that narcissists are always trying to break\u2026 You\u2019ll never become the same because you\u2019re too buse doubting your own reality and thoughts. The narcissist never admitted the wrongdoings they did to you so you spend a lot of time overthinking and really believing that you\u2019re crazy\u2026 You never become the same because the narcissist has filled you with most of the diseases, emotional tantrum and toxic shame they ridiculously had in them during all the relationship\u2026 So, yeah. I really believe that I\u2019ll never be the same\u2026 These ppl have break me\u2026but I\u2019m not defeated. I\u2019ll find my true self, my sanity, my health\u2026my inner spirit.\u2728 ",

            "answer_text": "I was not the same. I can\u2019t imagine anyone is ever the same if they have gone through a narc relationship. To be lied to by a person you loved, and thought loved you back, is shattering. To realise you wasted all that time, and believed all the lies, and were cheated on, and abused for no reason is pretty harmful to your self esteem. But the good thing is- because narcs all do the same thing, the pattern is always the same, so there are well documented and proven routes to recovery. And finding out about narcissism helps enormously- because you realise it is not you, it is the condition, there was nothing more you could have done, or not done, so you can stop feeling guilty and worrying you are a failure. Actually, overall I would say it is a good thing. I am a much more cynical, but much more balanced person than I was before. I do not suffer fools gladly, but if you earn my trust I will do anything for you. I have reset my priorities- I do not care about narc material possesions or status, I care about niceness and being genuine. And I know about narcissism, so now I am narc free and very pleased about it- my life is easier than it used to be. So, thanks, ex narc, the lessons you taught me were painful, but worthwhile. And now I spend some time each day on this site trying to tell people about the conditon so they can learn the same lessons in an easier way. Please learn about narcissism, so you understand it all. It is easily done, because they always act the same, all the time, so one good book will do it. I always recommend Prepare to be Tortured- the price you will pay for dating a narcissist. Amazon. The clue is in the title. Learn those red flags- I wish I had. Then, no matter what your personality type, you can keep away from all narcs. ",

It\u2019s almost like you gain a super human power over it. And if your smart enough everytime they come back you can always make them work for you. Bcs when you recognize and understand the mindset of a NARC, now; you are aware of it. And can use it to your advantage. And what makes it such a superhuman power to have is that, you don\u2019t have to be ugly or nasty about it. You can genuinely be kind and understanding and whole heartedly love them for who they are without judgement and reap the benefits of what they are doing for you too! But just don\u2019t ever get too attached . Know that they are always gonna leave but their always gonna come back. And whatever they do or say is not genuine, everything about them is superficial. Their \u201clove\u201d is superficial. Even the love for their own children is superficial. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the concept of being \u201cthe same\u201d is along the same lines as going back to your childhood hometown and expecting things to be exactly the same. Nothing is ever exactly the same because, in the case of humans, every experience we have alters us in some way. We grow, we learn and sometimes we are traumatized. We experience success, victory, failure, defeat, heartache, love - all of those things impact us and tweak us a little bit. I think it can be really defeating to focus on being \u201cthe same\u201dbecause it really is an illusion. A more suitable question may be can survivors of narcissistic abuse heal, find happiness, empowerment, peace. The answer to that is the same as it is for anyone who survives abuse regardless of the diagnosis or lack of diagnosis, of the perpetrator, and that answer is yes. It is possible to be whole, to feel whole and to reclaim yourself, your joy after suffering abuse. It isn\u2019t an easy journey, it isn\u2019t a quick one, but it is very, very possible. We give abusers too much power when we think in terms of \u201cI will never be the same again\u201d, though it is a common thought and feeling for anyone who has experienced trauma, from the death of a loved one to abuse. The reality is that no, we will never be \u201cthe same\u201d as we were before the relationship or the abuse happened, but that would be the case if it was a great relationship or if it was a miserable relationship without the abuse. Experiences change us. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a change that keeps us victims for the rest of our lives or that ends up taking away from who we are. We do not have to permanently lose ourselves. We get help, face and process the changes that have occurred and then either work to turn them into something positive or more positive, or to heal those pieces that have been bent or cracked a little. What we become, even after abuse, is still within our power to choose. We can\u2019t necessarily change certain effects of things, and we certainly can\u2019t make it so that it never happened. But what we do with the changes is completely within our power. That is how we take back our power. We do not allow the abuser to have the last word on who we are, what we are worth, what are life is going to be like and what contribution we bring to the world. That is still ours. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember being emotionally slammed to the point of despair repeatedly. Raged at for causing all Cheri's problems. Until I was on my knees in pain begging her to stop. I remember being shamed and demeaned by the only person on the planet I cared what they thought of me. Session after session of why I was not good enough for her and why i did not make the grade. I remember words coming from the girl of my dreams that cut me in half. Words any other person could have said that would have just bounced off. I remember the agony and defeat of being totally committed to Cheri, worshipping the ground she walked on and getting that total devotion body slammed to the ground with accusations that never stopped of cheating and infidelity. I felt the loneliness of being ignored, peminately neglected put on the back burner lowest possible priority. Lonelier than you could possible be being along. I remember my sense of self worth, my ability to feel joy and happiness drain away slowly until feeling numb was the best feeling I could hope for and rarely achieved. I remember feeling like a worthless pile of dung day after day. I remember the horror of knowing the person I thought the most of in the world and would have died for thinking I was the scum of the earth not good enough to wipe shit off her shoes on. Will I ever be the same again? No. ",

Everything you experience in life changes you unless you are incapable of experiencing life. Everything I've read, every answer on this site and others specifically points out how each and everyone who has experienced this abuse has changed. Everyone of them did not want to change like this. I have an autoimmune system that fights itself on a regular basis. Not only have I changed externally, my brain has changed and internally and I am now what my battered body and soul have been left with. Now I have to accept this, tear down what he did to me, rebuild and mend what I can and the project of \u201cself\u201d is construction project in process until the day I die. I am 60 and after 40 years of being torn down to what I am today and the truth of what it was all about makes me sick and angry. So, my question is why would you ask a question like this? ",

It has been researched and shown that living with a narcissist has a negative impact on our neurological health. Meaning that living with a narcissist can cause brain damage. Yes, this is not a hyperbolic statement. This is a reality. This is more the reason why so many of us who have left, healed, and become BETTER constantly preach NO CONTACT. It is the only way to heal and to get back to being who you are. Staying with a narcissist will only make your life worse. ",

I would love to quote the lines of my favorite author Haruki Marukami \u201cAnd once the storm is over, you won\u2019t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won\u2019t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.\u201d The above though resonates with every victor of abuse (i hate the word survivor ,i am a victor in the journey of peril like C-PTSD, prospoagnosia ( a medical condition arising from trauma,where in you have difficulty recognizing peoples face and memory fog .As a physician ,i encountered the nightmare,a plethora of medical issues ,when my abuser a physician in UK,had sailed on in life and career .I was but a pile of dust,shame and agony.As a physician ,i had reservations about how i could proceed in my career ,because i could not focus for more than 15minute\u2019s, the nightmares will not stop and i had no support system .Drifting in and out of a rudderless boat called life,not sure if i would sink or make it to the shore called joy and healing! I started this lonely journey \u201cBack from Hell\u201d,3 years ago. In a world of wolves ,being a lamb is a self victimizing game .I was but not with a wolf ,but a snake .I learnt life in the hardest possible way ,with the most painful experiences .Any new experience ,i am unnaturally scared but that has gotten better .I have found it incredibly difficult to trust and to love,but things evolved in my favor as life rolled on.I set boundaries and have grown to be fearless in ending relationships where i feel slight disrespect .It is the loss of innocence.Fear made me fearless \u2026..I let myself hate my abuser after i recovered to propel me .I never thought i would wake up from the nightmare-I not only woke up,i learnt to fly and built my self esteemThe biggest tragedy of wasted time with the abuser ,which i can never regain,taught me to learn each moment in gratitude and joy .I retrained my mind and from learning to write my name and full sentences ,to studying for my medical board exams,to concentrate for hours at a time to succeeding ,has been an unbelievable journey .I was discovered by a man (i shunned relationships due to shame and unreasonable fear of trauma ,violence and betrayal).This man ,gave me unconditional love and worked with me through my memory fogs .In addition ,my abuser used to call me names and insult me for being stupid and dumb .Today i am acknowledged by a partner who is a member of high iq club 999,as being smart (his validation ,has boosted my confidence and i am shortly appearing for my MENSA).To this beautiful man,i find it hard to utter\u201d I love you \u201c,i am in love but never drop my guard.I am cynical,but more balanced and emotionally very cautious .I will never ever go through this again.I gave talks on abuse,in a neighbourhood library and have exchanged my own story.I do not want anyone\u2019s sympathy ,but i want my pain to be the propellant for other abuse victims!!Abuse victims are never the same,some of us either wither like the autumn leaf or shine brighter than the sun,what you become is all in your hands .When the going gets tough ,the tough get going . My abuser, may have broken me,but can never destroy me.I will fight to live another day . A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it !-jean De La Fontaine .I believe no one can outrun his destiny .The tide will turn ,and this time in my favor to grow and succeed ! I have so much more to achieve and then my story will be sung !  ",

But my heart aches because I long for that feeling that I know I\u2019ll never feel again. I would give anything if I could go back in time. I remember the red flags, but I didn\u2019t listen to my inner voice because his lies felt so good. I wish I could go back and take action on what I knew, deep down, to be true. ",
