            "answer_text": "I think if you have the potential and well determined then YES you can. When I was in class 12 I wrote my first attempt of jee but didn't got a very good rank(somewhere around 10k in jee advanced and 12-13k in jee mains). So I was getting a decent nit but yet I was not very much satisfied with that as was not getting a good iit. So I decided to repeat and again the \u201cRace of IIT began \u201c. I studied very hard and then jan attempt came . I got 99.5 percentile in jan attempt and nothing great happened in sept attempt and 99.5 was considered as the best of two with a crl-6222. Fine,so now onwards I was focusing on jee advanced more then BitSat. But during that I did never aim for a particular rank this time because during my first attempt I developed a self pressure by thinking of some particular rank.Finally I wrote my jee adv paper. I did not attempt a large number of questions(something like 33\u201335 ques in each paper) but I was confident that these will be correct. And finally I got 202 Marks and AIR-1289 in jee advanced.Also my bitsat score was 342. So I think it is possible to get into iit in a year. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the school district. School districts in India have curriculum that varies a lot. Having said that, an average student will have a hard time cracking IIT JEE exam within one year of preparation. I am a product of New Delhi Public school and I made it without any preparation in 1965. I was in the top 5% of student body and at that time, Delhi science curriculum focussed on engineering and medicine. Since then, the competition for IIT has increased and the public school education has taken a nose dive. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is made for me. I did not study a bit for jee in my 11 and 12. I had planned to take a year drop and ace a good jee rank. I knew it was hard but doable. So I did it. I took a year drop, joined a coaching institute, did my best, put my heart and soul in it for a year and here I am today with a 1116 rank in advanced (obc) and 6426 (gen). I have got iit Kanpur mechanical in first round of counselling and hoping for upgradation in the next rounds to come. I even got a 518(gen) rank in wbjee this time. So you see it is possible. ",
