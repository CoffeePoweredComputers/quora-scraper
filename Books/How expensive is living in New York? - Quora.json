            "answer_text": "The cost of living in New York varies a lot, really depending on your personality and your lifestyle. For rent, it depends on where you want to live: In Manhattan, it\u2019s average about $2\u20133k for a one bedroom. A lot of people share the one bedroom with 1 or 2 roommates to share the rent while still afford to live in Manhattan. Alternative to Manhattan is Brooklyn, Jersey City and Queens, the rent there is relatively cheaper. You can find some 1br apt in good area for about $1.5k-2k. It\u2019s great if you want to live by yourself or reduce the cost as much as possible. The commute from those area to Manhattan is very reasonable as well. Further away is The Bronx, Staten Island and Long Island. Those areas housing option is much cheaper; however, the commute is longer. There are some great neighborhood in The Bronx and Long Island as well, I\u2019m not sure about Staten Island though. Normally, landlord will require your income to be at least 40x your rent. You will usually need first month, 1 month security deposit and broker fee in order to rent a place. These other expenses below are based on my experience and lifestyle. I go to the office 3 days a week and work from home half the time. Internet: You can go as low as $40/month but I pay $80 for faster Internet. I don\u2019t have cable TV.Phone: I paid $70 but I can be as low as $30\u201340 I think.Water: If you rent, the landlord will normally cover your water cost.Heat: Depends on the apartment, some places cover heat. Otherwise it\u2019s about $100 during the winter.Electricity: Depends on the apartment, in my old apartment I paid $80 in the winter and $150 in the summer (because of the AC). My new apartment has newer appliances that use electricity more effectively, so I\u2019m paying about half the price.Cooking gas: $20\u201340Transportation: About $120 for monthly subway passUber: I also spend about $100 monthly for Uber.Food: If you eat out a lot and don\u2019t cook, food can cost upward to $1000+. If you do cook, plan your meal and shop at cheap groceries, it can get as low as $200\u2013300.I personally average about $500\u2013600 with both eating out and cooking.Going out with a friend can cost from $30\u2013100+ per night depends the type of activities.Other expense you need to keep in mind:Gym membershipPet expense (if you have pet)Entertainment (Netflix, Hulu subscription, etc)",

            "answer_text": "This question is nearly impossible to answer in any broadly meaningful way, given the wide array of lifestyles and incomes that NYC encompasses -- a single mom in Section 8 housing is going to experience the costs of NYC very differently than a Tribeca Goldman wife with a live-in nanny and two private preschool tuitions...  From the perspective of a market-rent-paying, non-car-keeping, junior white-collar professional living in Manhattan or a \"nice\" part of Brooklyn: Housing: ~$1400 per month for rent, plus ~$150 in utilities/cable/misc household stuff. Can vary substantially depending on where you live, though -- I've had friends pay as little as $800 a month for a small room in a less gentrified/convenient neighborhood, and you can also rent penthouses for $25k+ a month if that's what you're looking for. Depending on your exact living situation, you may also have to tip your building staff at Christmas (anywhere from $200-$800 seems in the range of normal, depending on your staff size -- and I'm sure there are luxury buildings where much more is expected...) and/or pay a small common charge to use some/all building amenities. Transportation: $115 for a monthly subway pass, plus ~$100 a month in cabs. Again, YMMV considerably -- if you get stuck ubering on a surge-pricing night, a single 10 minute trip could cost you $50. Food: If you buy lunch near the office, expect to spend ~$8-10 per meal unless you can walk to Chinatown or want streetmeat every single day. Basic takeout dinners usually run me around $15 per person, and then meals with friends (dinner, brunch) can be anywhere from $20-$50. Cooking will definitely bring down your meal costs - just remember that Whole Foods is probably the cheapest grocery store in NYC. (And of course, \"cooking\" PB&J is a very different cost structure than cooking gourmet meals...) If you cook 25% of the time and eat out or get takeout 75% of the time, it's pretty easy to spend ~$700 a month on eating. One caveat here is that some offices will cater or expense workday/night meals, which could potentially bring your costs down substantially -- although in my experience those who get \"meal perks\" at work make up the difference by splurging more on weekend dining... Going out: A key part of the social experience, especially since many of your friends will have tiny apartments. This can range from no-cover/$4-$6 beers if you like dive bars, to $1000+ bottles if you like table service -- if you're a girl who can't drink that much anyways, ~$150-$250 a month (on top of food/cabs -- already included above) should keep you covered, depending on exactly what's on your calendar. Guys -- especially single ones with healthy tolerances -- will most likely spend more... Keeping up appearances: This category, to me, encompasses personal upkeep and includes everything from new clothes to mani/pedis to gym memberships. Exactly how much you spend here is extremely dependent on your personal preferences, but some basic observations: Clothes/shoes/etc. from national chains cost the same amount in NYC as anywhere else - and there is no sales tax for anything under $110. If you have the time for them, sample sales can also be a great way to score lovely pieces for 50-90% off retail -- just be prepared to stand in line and dig. On the flip side, if you're into the pricier stuff, NYC has a variety of great bespoke tailors, not to mention lustworthy flagship stores for just about every luxury brand in existence... Personal care services can be surprisingly cheap in NYC -- I've paid as little as $10 with tip for a solid manicure, and have gotten some great massages (look for the Chinese \"tui-na\" shops) for ~$60/hour with tip. Haircuts can run as low as $12 for women, and I've gotten some solid cuts for $30-$40 with tip. Many of the nicer/newer buildings will include gym access in your rent. If you need to find a gym elsewhere, pricing starts at ~$40/month for Blink Fitness to $200 + initiation fee at Equinox. You can also find a variety of boutique fitness classes and yoga/pilates in the $20-$35 per class range. Running outside is, of course, still free. Adding up the above categories (assuming $300 for \"appearances) gets to ~$3000 in costs per month -- about half of which is housing-related.  Assuming you're paying about 40% in taxes (income, payroll, etc.), and that you save 10% of your pre-tax salary via a 401K and budget another $200/month for unexpected costs (lost phone, friend getting married), you would have to make just over $70K a year to support this lifestyle -- which isn't crazy for this particular demographic group.
