            "answer_text": "Only my personal experience here: no. I suspect it depends on how you listen and how you read, but I struggle not to let my mind wander when I'm just listening, even if I'm not doing anything else. Since I don't skim read, I like to visual what's going on when I'm reading and so am much more engaged with what's going on. I like using audio books when it is not easy to read (e.g. on a bus journey or when ironing). The good thing is that they are easy to replay. I have found listening to non-fiction audio books frustratingly slow. Even though I don't skim read, I read much faster that a narrator talks, and so another reason why audio books are less efficient than reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Listening may provide better retention than reading for some people. We all learn in different ways and find some ways more easy than others. It's worth trying the experiment to see how it works for you. In my own case, I find retention about the same if I do it with the same level of concentration. But I read faster than I listen, so I only listen to audio books for entertainment, or when my hands aren't free, or when there's no print version easily available. ",
