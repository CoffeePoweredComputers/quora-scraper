            "answer_text": "Everything that you do in class 11th is very important for 2 reasons. First, the IIT-JEE paper consists of about 50% questions from 11th syllabus. Neglecting 11th chemistry would mean there is no chance for you to get more than 50\u201360% marks in chemistry. Chemistry is agreed to be the most scoring subject in JEE among all three.. The other reason that people often overlook is that if your 11th preparation is top notch, it gives you a different kind of confidence and provides the \u201cdriving force\u201d to master 12th class syllabus. Without this confidence, it is highly unlikely that you'll be able to excel in class 12 chemistry. So do class 11 chemistry very nicely. Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Class 11th chemistry is really important because in 11 all the basic concepts of chemistry are developed eg electronegativity, resonance , lattice, etc. Also chapters like redox reactions are the base for chapters like p block and electrochemistry in 12th. So I would suggest to not mug it all up and rather understand the concept because all these concepts will be used extensively in the future. Peace . ",
