The Great Tribulation is the first phase of Armageddon. Which will be marked by the All World Governments turning upon Babylon the Great The world Empire of False God dishonering Religion. And as in the entire chapter of Revelation 18 is speaking in symbolic language about the destruction of God dishonering Religions of the World by all of the world's Government's. The Empire of false Religion which will be removed stripped of her power and glory from having a kingdom over the kings of the Earth. Revelation 17:18 And then full Armageddon begins with the prophecy predicted in Daniel 2:44 ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus\u2019s apostles asked about when they would know the end was near. Jesus responded, \u201cThe due time is near.\u2019 Do not go after them. Furthermore, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified. For these things must take place first, but the end will not occur immediately.\u201d Then he said to them: \u201cNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs\u201d There are a couple points we can draw here! Only Jehovah, God knows the exact date and time. However, the Bible does describes \u201csigns\u201d that would hint the tribulation period is near. How many are we seeing today? Wars and disturbances, earthquakes, food shortages, pestilences (aka illnesses/pandemics), & fearful sights. \u2014 We turn on the news and see a combination of these on a daily basis. Should we be afraid? Granted some truly scary, horrific things are happening, but as Jesus mentioned, these things have to happen. We have to be patient, the end won\u2019t be coming right away, but it\u2019s on the horizons. Now is the time to draw close to God. Stay safe, and for more info you can message me or check out the website linked in my profile! Kindly, Izzie ",

            "answer_text": "No, not yet. The tribulation begins with the political powers turning on the world\u2019s false religions, which obviously has not begun. It is hard to imagine that could possibly happen since the political powers are so influenced by the predominant religions of their countries. But this is typical of Jehovah\u2019s major prophecies. He almost never foretells things which look likely to happen, he often foretells things no one believe could possibly happen. So that when those prophecies were fulfilled everyone would know that only the all-powerful God could have made it happen. Revelation 18:20\u201321 NW \u2014 Be glad over her, O heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf!\u201d 21 And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: \u201cThus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but I would never take the apocalyptical texts (such as Daniel\u2019s prophesies) literally. This was the mistake the Jewish scholars and clerics made that led them to reject Jesus. In reality, we have been in the promised period since the mid 1800s. We have seen knowledge increase, greater wars, the development of devastating weapons of war, kingship falling and rapid changes in nations and declines in empires, and increasing travel and communication (lightning traveling across the earth). However, it is not at all as people in Christianity (and Judaism or Islam) who believe in apocalyptic events have literally understood such things. Some elements of the story really relate to much earlier periods in time as well. Also, I would not assume literal interpretations or that these fantastical events will occur within a relatively short period of time. A Day ofGod can be a millenium (a thousand years on earth). In reality, we have been in the promised period since the mid 1800s. We have seen knowledge increase, greater wars, the development of devastating weapons of war, kingship falling and rapid changes in nations and declines in empires, and increasing travel and communication (lightning traveling across the earth). However, it is not at all as people literally understand such things. See, for example, Able, Apocalypse Secrets, 2011, for a more recent analysis and commentary. ",

But a few more prophecies need to fulfil before the actual period of tribulation with the seven last plagues begins. The mark of the beast, which is the Sunday law, must be globally imposed (which we are seeing signs of), there should be a great awakening among Gods people where many will be converted to the faith, (This is the latter rain) and judgment needs to end. Once judgment ends, the seven last plagues will begin. Visit this website for great prophecy studies www.end-times-prophecy.org ",
