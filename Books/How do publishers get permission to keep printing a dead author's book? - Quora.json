            "answer_text": "It depends on how long the author has been dead. If they have been dead long enough, the book is likely in the public domain, and thus anyone can publish it without needing permission. If they are very recently dead, the publisher may have a contract that hasn\u2019t run out yet (the last book I sold was with a 5-year contract. If I died tomorrow, my publisher would still have four years on that contract they could keep, just with giving my next-of-kin the royalties). If neither of the above are true, then they generally need to get permission from the author\u2019s estate (generally under control of the author\u2019s heirs), which can enter into a new contract with the publisher.

If that author has an agent then the agent will renew contracts, or sell contracts on to other publishers, to keep the books in print, and the author\u2019s heirs will keep receiving royalties. If the author died intestate, then the books are called \u201corphaned\u201d, and the publisher owns the copyright. ",
