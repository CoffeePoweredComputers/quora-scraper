            "answer_text": "First you have to buy the right to translate it into the desired language. This can be obtained from the rights department of the original publisher; if they don't have the rights they will direct you to the author or agent. If you are envisioning a commercial publication, it can help to approach the publisher in your destination language, who may give you an advance and help acquire the rights. Grants are also often available from institutions in the original language, especially from European languages into English. ",
