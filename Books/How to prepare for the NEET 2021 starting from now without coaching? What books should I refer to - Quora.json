            "answer_text": "If you are not interested in joining coaching institutes like aakash or allen u must atleast enroll urself in distance learning course in any of these 2 institute... This is because you will be provided with study materials and eligible to give online tests time to time which is very necessary to Crack NEET. Study materials of both aakash and allen are more than sufficient.. No need to buy any reference books as it will be waste of money ... Buy only ncert books or the text books prescribed by other respective boards . My suggestion is to join classroom programme in allen or aakash\u2026.no need of joining even pvt tuition class as they are sufficient. Save time.... Don't waste money on unnecessary books and tuition teachers...If you are enrolling in coaching institute then never lag behind the class... Give tests time to time... Ultimately hard work will not bring 100 percent success... It's the smart work which will help you to crack neet with flying colors... All the best dear ",
