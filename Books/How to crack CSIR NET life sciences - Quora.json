            "answer_text": "I have achieved CSIR 15 rank in lifesciences NET exam so this makes me eligible to write the funda of studying for net exam . I didn't use any shortcut, so should you; it will not help you in near future as race doesn't end here . You will have to face number of interviews to get admitted to best Ph. D institutes. Moreover, I will not be discussing about how long you should study because that depends on person to person, you should decide how much time you has to invest. I will tell you the strategy that I have followed to qualify the NET exam. No shortcut: Do not skip reference books specifically when it comes to life sciences. Most of the questions in the paper are from these books. So whenever you study an over weighty volumes of reference books, just think to read them once . For example if you have to cover a biochemistry topic say proteins, start by reading this chapter and everytime you come across a details that you weren\u2019t aware of, just write down those points in your note book. Do this for all chapters of each book that you will read. (The note book should be thick enough to contain much details) Now, as you have completed writing down the highlights of the chapter in your note book . In future you don\u2019t have to go though the long page of reference books instead you can pick up your notebook and start reading it and probably wont sleep too while studying: p 2- Highlights: Further, I have also used post-it notes so as to minimize the reading material and to prevent myself reading the points that I have already knew by heart. This trick helped me a lot in saving the precious time. 3- \u201cMake notes of notes\u201d I would recommend to prepare notes and then concise those notes too because reading through those 6 months you must have learn some points by heart; so why waste time in reading all those things again n again. 4- Tackle a boring chapter: Whenever you feel reluctance in studying any difficult chapter (which makes the chapter boring too). Skip the reference books and directly go and solve the objective question paper of that chapter and then you will get an idea about what type of questions are being asked in the paper. ( I would recommend R.S. chauhan\u2019 s lifescience objective book for objective question paper) 5. Plus point- If you are taking help from a coaching, then try to make most out of it. Student tend to think that only going to coaching will be enough. No, do as your mentor says and study side by side on your own . Dont just depend on the coaching because sometimes due to lack of time, mentor skip some part of syllabus. So do independent study too. 6. Avoid the Red wire syndrome - Don\u2019t panic while giving the exam. Don\u2019t attempt questions that you are not very sure of. For e.g. If you attempt 15 questions from C part and all of them are right you will score 60. But if you attempt 25 questions due to \u201cred wire syndrome\u201d and 10 out of them are wrong then you will score below 60 . 7. Revise- Whatever study , revise it. :) Edit: Friends Please follow my blog \u201cDiscover lifeSciences\u201d . Link is in my profile description. ",

            "answer_text": "The other answers here are really good and I may not repeat their points so I strongly recommend reading them as well. From my experience, I would suggest that students preparing for CSIR UGC NET JRF EXAMINATION should - 1) Focus on their concepts and fundamentals primarily and understand the topics well than simply mugging up everything. Not everyone can learn everything so one has to select the topics one is good at and perfect them first accordingly and so on. 2) Practice lots of questions (MCQs) topic wise pertaining to CSIR, GATE, IISC, JNU etc as they help in strengthening the understanding of concepts and helps save time in understanding the question on exam day. In this way, one is able to understand beforehand the tricks and twists in the questions which may otherwise lead to silly mistakes. 3) One should be careful about their strategy during exam. Since it involves 25% negative marking for each wrong answer, one has to be extremely cautious in selecting questions and answering them. Do not answer every question rather only the ones that one is confirm and confident of being correct to prevent negative marking. Still, one can take a chance of attempting a wrong answer if uncertain in Section B where it carries 2 marks for each correct answer compared to Section C which carriers 4 marks for each correct answer. So if an answer goes wrong in Section C, 1 mark gets deducted and it will hurt the overall score badly compared to Sections A and B where only 0.5 mark is lost.  4) Make the most of the 3 hours of examination and utilise this time wisely. One should give their best efforts as much as possible. Begin from Section B then move onto Section C and try to improve the score by attempting some questions in Section A as it really gives a bonus. One should not give up during the exam and try to attempt as many questions possible correctly. (One cannot gauge the threshold score beforehand so one should aim to maximise their score as much as possible. Many students fail to qualify because of this mistake.) Remember it is a competitive examination. One should attempt all the easy questions first that one is confirm and confident of then spend time on the less easy ones. It is not necessary to attempt all 35/50 questions in Section B and all 25/75 questions in Section C if one is uncertain of all answers to be correct. Instead even 17-20 questions in Section C will suffice if they are done correctly. 5) Remove any kind of fear and negativity pertaining to the exam. Be confident to clear the exam. It is actually one of the easiest examinations because of the vast range of questions one has the opportunity to choose from.This really makes the exam very scoring and simple unlike any other exam. 6) Lastly but importantly, one must never underestimate the power of prayers, meditation and physical activity with a balanced diet during the course of preparation. It helps improve memory, concentration, stamina and understanding. Good luck and Best Wishes!!! I'll be happy to take any questions pertaining to this. ",
