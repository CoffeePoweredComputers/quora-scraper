            "answer_text": "You just answered your own question\u2026If there was a God - he would just kill anyone who is against him\u2026 step on them like insignificant ants\u2026 yet - he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s people who kill in the name of God\u2026 mostly other religious people from another religion\u2026which means people are \u201cGod\u201d, as God wouldn\u2019t need human\u2019s help on that. But God never killed anyone himself. Just like Superman never did\u2026as Superman doesn\u2019t really exist, does he ?God was never seen by anyone\u2026 outside their own imagination.God has no single proof for existence.It is a made up story created to put fear in people and have them obey religion rules. Let me ask you this - if you wanted your own people to stop killing and stealing and raping - would you tell them \u201cAnthony said you must stop because it\u2019s not a good thing to do!\u201d - OR - would you tell them \u201cGod almighty will punish you if you don\u2019t stop !\u201d\u2026Same thing as if you wanted your own people to go to war for you and kill your enemy\u2026 would they risk their lives for you - OR - would they do it for a God that \u201cwants\u201d them to do it \u2026 ? Even if you create a human hero - a strong and fearless warrior that is going to scare people from doing bad things \u2026 he is just a human. He can get hurt\u2026 he can die\u2026 someone would eventually go against him and kill him\u2026 and there goes your \u201cpower\u201d of controlling people. But a \u201cGod\u201d\u2026 someone that no one sees and no one can hurt\u2026that NEVER NEVER dies\u2026 that\u2019s a much better story, don\u2019t you think? - it\u2019s a story that can last 2000 years :) God does not kill atheists \u2026 he does not kill anyone\u2026simply because he does not exist. He NEVER did. It\u2019s a myth\u2026 a scary story they used to tell before bed to make their kids behave\u2026 it\u2019s like Baba Yaga\u2026 or Santa Clause. Why do you think they invented Santa ? - to make kids be good all year long so they can get gifts on Xmas day\u2026 it\u2019s a motivational character.God is the EXACT same thing\u2026 but God will send you to HELL if you misbehave\u2026 more scary\u2026 more \u201cadulty\u201d. God will punish you if you steal or murder\u2026 will not let you go into heaven when you die\u2026bla bla. If you think about ALL that you know about God - everything\u2026 including death and angels and hell and heaven\u2026 how do you know about that ? - all from stories\u2026 But how do the people who wrote those stories knew about it ? I assure you there is not a single person in the world that visited Hell and came back to tell how it\u2019s like\u2026 God was \u201cinvented\u201d in a way that he could not be proven. Or disprovenThat\u2019s the only smart thing they did about God\u2026 everything else is complete stupidity. He has no specific powers - just everything he wants to do - he can do\u2026 He can fly and live in the sky but we cannot see him or go to him or catch him or hurt him\u2026 He can create the entire world\u2026 but only long time ago, not now\u2026 now he does nothing. He is always coming \u201ctomorrow\u201d.. not today\u2026 always tomorrow\u2026 Everything good is thanks to him, and everything bad is because he teaches us a lesson\u2026 no matter what happens to you - it\u2019s God. Why ? Because God works in mysterious ways\u2026 TRANSLATION : he does everything - good and evil\u2026 you cannot understand him.  And he has super brain that can read ALL our minds and know everything about us and remember everything we did all our lives - and know our sins\u2026 all billions of us. He is THAT smart\u2026 yep\u2026 he is a super computer. If you really think about it - God is a superhero a kid would make up\u2026 it has no logic and by itself is very stupid. It\u2019s very vague and makes absolutely no sense\u2026 unless you\u2019re a 4 years old.They really were VERY stupid back then when he was invented.Today , he would be more like Superman \u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "As I write, the question is \u201cIf God is against atheists, why does he not kill them?\u201d There are at least three big assumptions there, one that god exists, another that god has a problem with atheists, and a third that we have a narcissistic god who prioritises being worshiped above all else, so he or she would single out atheists rather than say pedophiles, racists, murderers and others who have done wrong in life. The obvious answer is that in the unlikely event that a god exists, he or she is clearly OK with atheists being around. Maybe that\u2019s because the whole religious thing hasn\u2019t worked so well at getting people to be better people - just look at the US where many of the most religious are lining up behind Trump. Maybe it is because god just isn\u2019t too bothered about being worshiped and wants to see what people will do if they have free will and no religion telling them what to do. Nobody knows the answer to that, all we do know is that if a god existed and wanted to reveal themselves to atheists they could easily do so. Religions can be divided into those that believe in a good god who wants people to be nice to each other and create a better world, with rewards and punishment in this life or the next depending on how you treat others. Or a narcissistic, or even an evil god, who is not bothered by your behaviour and instead focuses on whether you worship them. The question only makes sense if there is a god, and he or she is this sort of god rather than a benevelont one. ",
