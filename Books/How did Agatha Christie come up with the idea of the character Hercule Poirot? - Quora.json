            "answer_text": "Poirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: Marie Belloc Lowndes' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans' Monsieur Poiret, a retired Belgian police officer living in London. A obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of Arthur Conan Doyle. In An Autobiography, Christie states, \"I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition \u2013 eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp\". Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to A. E. W. Mason's fictional detective, Inspector Hanaud of the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, who first appeared in the 1910 novel At the Villa Rose and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years. Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. Source :- Hercule Poirot - Wikipedia ",
