            "answer_text": "No, you\u2019re not alone. Moreover, on that show, Seinfeld was the least funny of the characters. He was Abbott in Abbott and Costello, or Larry in the Three Stooges. But to your question, there\u2019s no doubt that being a dick detracts from one\u2019s comedic bona fides. One of the greatest comedic geniuses, Don Rickles, known as \u201cMr. Warmth\u201d for his schtick of being hostile and insulting, always ended his act by showing that after all \u2026 he was just kidding! Seinfeld, on the other hand, was just pretending to be Mr. Nice, and just like that slob, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, the \u201cQueen of nice,\u201d he didn\u2019t fool anyone. ",

            "answer_text": "Jerry Seinfeld is a brilliant comedian, because he had the confidence to allow the 2nd, 3rd and 4th banana to get laughs. He copied the Jack Benny Model. Comedy is rude. Tell me a funny joke that\u2019s funny that isn\u2019t rude. There\u2019s a difference between humor and comedy. Humor is not as offensive, but definitely not as funny. ",
