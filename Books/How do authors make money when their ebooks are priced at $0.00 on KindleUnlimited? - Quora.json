            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t make much. They are building an audience for their next or previous book which people will be willing to pay for if they like the writer. The good thing about being a writer (there are some) is that readers are loyal. Of the writers I like, I will buy any new book blind (until they piss me off). I was a huge Philip Kerr fan for decades. Bought everything until the last two. Now I\u2019m done and sad. I will say it\u2019s a strange thing on Kindle though, that people will wait for a free day when the book is only $2.99 anyway. Finally, people who \u2018subscribe\u2019 (a monthly or annual fee) do pay money. That money goes into a pool which Kindle distributes to the writers (quarterly, I think) depending on how many down-loads you have. We get a deposit regularly for The Virgin Whore Trial and they are always sending updates about the rules. I imagine Netflix so something similar. My kid has a subscription, and I guess they track what he watches and disperse a portion of the subscription money accordingly. That\u2019s all I know. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon determines an amount of money to divvy up among all Kindle Unlimited authors on a monthly basis. No one knows how they pick this number, and it changes every month. Then they add up how many pages of an unlimited author\u2019s works have been read for the first time during this time period and determine what percentage of total new pages read by unlimited authors this number represents. They then give each author that percentage of the Kindle Unlimited money. Normally this translates to a wickedly low amount of money per page, but this number rotates and can\u2019t be predicted. Generally, around $0.0004 though. Also, if a customer doesn\u2019t have unlimited, they can still buy the book and the author will make either 70% or 30% of the cost. By being downloaded as an unlimited book, a book will get a boost in search results. So, it\u2019s possible for an author to make more money on an unlimited book than they would if they refused the freebie market. I hope that made sense. ",
