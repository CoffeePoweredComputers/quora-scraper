            "answer_text": "Go to your local library\u2019s website and see if you can get a digital copy and borrow it in your desired format. Otherwise, don\u2019t do further damage to the efforts of authors and publishers to earn a living. Even authors of bestselling books earn only a few dollars per copies, and may have only a single bestseller in their entire life. They probably have devoted two or three years to completing that book. If you can\u2019t be bothered to go to a library to avoid paying a few dollars to read it, or pick up a Kindle version of these bestsellers when they come up on sale (which they do, frequently \u2014 I paid $2.99 for mine in just such a sale) \u2014 shame on you. It\u2019s unethical. Oh, and it\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s theft of someone\u2019s intellectual property. Go ahead, pat yourself on the back on the assumption that you won\u2019t get caught. And know that there are a substantial number of people who will despise you for your behavior. ",
