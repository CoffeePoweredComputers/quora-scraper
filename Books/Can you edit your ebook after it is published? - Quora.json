            "answer_text": "The Amazon help topic is helpful: Update Your Book Details Note that for readers who have already bought your book, regardless of how they have set their automatic update options, your revised edition will not be offered to those readers unless you contact Amazon and ask them to send an offer to existing purchasers to receive an updated version. To do so, you will need to provide detailed information about the changes to Amazon and convince them that the change is a significant quality improvement for the reader. If you don\u2019t, only people who buy your book after your revision will get the new version. I believe that updates are easily possible on all ebook publishers after the book is released. But it\u2019s definitely best for your readers if you never need to do that. You should include some note on the book details page so the edition can be distinguished easily from the earlier editions (don\u2019t change the book title to add the edition number). If the revisions are so major that the book is very different\u2014substantial new matter, or any substantial deletion\u2014 I believe you should issue it with a different ISBN and perhaps even title: check the guidelines for your country\u2019s ISBN provider. Regarding the edition number, Amazon says (see: Enter eBook Details): You can provide an edition number if this title is a new edition of an existing book. An edition is a particular version of a book. The edition number tells readers whether the book is an original version or an updated version. If this is the first time you have published this book, enter the numeral 1. If the book was previously published and the version you are publishing contains significant changes, enter the numeral 2 (and so on). ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Can you edit your Ebook after it is published? A: On Lulu, Amazon, B&N, and Smashwords yes you can edit your ebook after publishing if an issue is discovered. Common issues prompting it are \u201cwrong file uploaded\u201d and \u201ca reader discovered a typo that editors and beta readers missed.\u201d If not well labeled or in a separate folder from drafts it is VERY easy to upload the wrong manuscript file and then miss all the things that had been corrected on rereading due to writer brains reading what SHOULD be there instead of what IS there. If you edit and reupload you will use the same listing in your book dashboard/shelf. In your new file on the front with the copyright information include \u201crevision 2\u201d or \u201cedition 2.\u201d On Amazon there is also a place to put that in their system when going through the three pages of fill boxes to resubmit.
