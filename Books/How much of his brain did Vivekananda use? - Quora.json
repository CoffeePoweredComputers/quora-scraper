            "answer_text": "All those stories you hear about Vivekananda using 13% and Einstein using 7-8% of their respective brains is GOLDEN BULLSHIT! First of all, let's be clear, the % of brain used is not the physical part of the brain they're talking about. They're talking in terms of the working capacity of the brain.Still, that's all made-up nonsense.Just think. How can someone calculate the % of a particular thing when one doesn't know what the full capacity(100%) is?If you don't know what the full working capacity of your brain is( I'm sure nobody does), then how can you calculate what % of it you used? I would say these stories were made-up just to make us realize that our brains are seemingly very powerful and we don't utilize the full potential. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Swami viveknanda once did say that an average human only uses 10% of his brain power. Now, I am an ardent follower of the Ramakrishna Mission. In fact, I was raised by a family of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda devotees. I admire Swami Vivekananda very much but let me repeat one of his quotes: \u201cStand up and reason out, having no blind faith. Religion is a question of being and becoming, not of believing. This is religion, and when you have attained to that you have religion.\u201d Just b/c you disagree w/ a great soul doesn\u2019t mean that you are wrong or an atheist. As a psychology student, I remember learning that on a span per day, one uses 100% of the brain. Of course, Vivekananda could have meant that a human only uses 10% of brain potential and some of his followers have blindly taken that. a ",
