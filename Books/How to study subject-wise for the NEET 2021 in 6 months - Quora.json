            "answer_text": "So, you know the fact that you have 6 months and you have to prepare all three subjects in this time span. Now the most important thing is to utilise these 6 months from the very first day. Don\u2019t think that i will start tomorrow or next Monday etc., that thing will push you back. Start doing your preparation asap and here is the schedule\ud83d\udc47 Since you\u2019re studying at home now and you don\u2019t have to go at coaching to take classes, it really have both good & bad prospects.Bad is that some students don\u2019t feel helpful to study at home, they complain about the environment not suitable. But the good thing is you have your notes now and you don\u2019t need to waste your time by taking those long classes again.Also one another good thing is that you have 5\u20136 extra hours which were wasted in taking classes, watching movies, going market etc etc. So, the point here is you have more opportunities if you have your notes and taken all classes. You just have to give your best at self study.Make a plan by dividing your whole day into 4 parts- Morning, afternoon, evening & night. You have to study in all 4 parts of the day and it should be done consistently. Approx 1.5\u20132 hours study in each part regularly will give you best results.Some day if you can\u2019t follow this schedule by any reason then don\u2019t be upset, just try to compensate that portion in remaining parts.Now subject wise strategy- 1.) Physics: only thing that make your physics\u2699\ufe0f strong is to understand concept & formula properly. Solve more and more questions daily and try to increase your speed of solving problems. Because time matters in all exams, there is no point of solving a question if you are doing this in 4\u20135 minutes. You have to be both accurate and fast.2.)Chemistry: This is an interesting subject which have both qualities of consuming and saving your time in exam. For organic chemistry \ud83e\uddea you have to read those notes just 2\u20133 times and believe me if you read them properly then you\u2019ll remember them until your exam. They play an important role because you can solve them within seconds like biology questions, so it will be time saving part. For inorganic chemistry you have to practice like physics problems and try to revise them regularly.3.)Biology: Every medical student loves biology \ud83e\uddec because it is the easiest subject among three. Just go for NCERT only and read that book so much times that you can remember each word, line and diagram. Every single line and diagram is important for exam, so try to score nearly above 80 in biology to get selected. ALL THE BEST\ud83d\udd96",

            "answer_text": "Make a shedule for one day and give equal time to all the three subjects . Continue this shedule for 1\u20132 months and manage proper time for all the three subjects. Focus only on more important topics, and make a list of your weak, strong, intermediate topics. In first -second month it will feel like any subject is demanding more time and any subject is completed in less time. Manage your time according to your needs. In this two months make proper changes in your shedule as you observe . After second month stick to your new comfortable shedule and continue your study upto 4 months. And don't forget to revise all the topics you have studied. Make proper revision in every 2\u20133 weeks, because REVISION is the only key to success for a NEET aspirant. ",
