            "answer_text": "Really impossible to say, as each avid reader moves at a different speed and, quite likely, at a changing level of difficulty. For instance, I am mildly dyslexic, so, no matter how fascinated I am by a particular book, I am not able to read it as quickly as most other avid readers can. In my pocket calendar, I keep a list of books that I have finished. In a year, I typically read 15\u201317 volumes. I know that there are other avid readers who can read 100 books a year. I feel some slight envy about this, but it\u2019s minor; I just move as rapidly as I comfortably can, still maintaining what seems to be full comprehension. A bonus of being such a slow reader is that I am able to savor syntax, sentence structure, word choice, etc., and this gives me a feeling of deep connection with the writer and with his or her story. Another benefit of being a slow avid reader is that I am very careful about choosing books. Typically, friends keep me informed of the best books they have read. Some are short; some are long; some are straightforward (but rich); some are complex. Two days ago, I began Olivia Manning\u2019s BALKAN TRILOGY, a read that has been highly recommended to me numerous times over the years. It totals about 1000 pages. I used to shy away from large books, because of the amount of time I\u2019d need to devote to a single title, but I learned that an excellent 1000-pager contains as much information and texture and entertainment as three different 350-page volumes. Also, in long books, I am able to contemplate how the author solved the very complex problems of structure that arise in building at length. Being an avid reader is exciting, no matter how many books he or she reads; it\u2019s the quality of the works that counts\u2014not how many one can finish. Best wishes. ",
