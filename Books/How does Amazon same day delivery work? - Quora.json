            "answer_text": "Amazon is epitome of perfection in Operations & Supply Chain Logistics. I will try to explain answer in a stepped manner of how flow works in a typical E-commerce company: 1. Order by Customer: The process of fulfilling a item in single day starts from the time when a Customer starts searching a product on Amazon. By their continuous capital investments and operational expenditures in technology, Amazon has built up a set of highly efficient data communication flow in system with ERP softwares talking with each other in microseconds. It should be noted that Amazon first quarter of 2019 spend almost 8 Billion $ on technology & content so you can consider the magnitude of their commitment towards building a technological capability. This customer order almost instantly reach the warehouse where Amazon stores product of suppliers (who have agreed for fulfillment by Amazon). There thousands of workers working in a set manner (with each movement happening only if it is required and no wastage of a hand movement through pre-implementation of operational techniques like Time & Motion Study). Further it has come to news that Amazon is working on a predictive analytics model that will pre-ship the products to the destination warehouse before even customer ordered. This technology will require Amazon to have analyze to unimagined quantity of data to gauge the predictive demand of region, narrowing it to down to street level and person.  2. Warehouse Operations: Amazon warehouse operations is a Matrix world where Machines and Human work together with thousand of rectangular floor robots called Pegasus brings products to the human operators who tape them in pre-cut boxes, warp them in through machine and place a label on them...And there the product goes scanning and finally jumping to Amazon's 3 PL logistics providers trucks. Here it should be noted that though packaging I believe is still pre-dominantly human but I believe by multiple motion and time studies, human movements are almost robotic with no waste movement. I have also heard that Amazon has even placed a watch over the hands of workers to record the way they work. So start loving the hard work of people who make it possible for the product to reach you in time.  3. Shipping Product to Consumers: It should be noted before I start that Amazon spend precisely 8.6 Billion dollars on fulfillment which I believe is superset of delivery cost to consumers. Amazon tie up with 3PL service providers for shipments and last mile delivery like UPS, US Postal Services. And many of these 3PL service providers like UPS also use the complex route and capacity optimization tools so that your order is delivered to you just in time or I will say just before time. Amazon is also heavily investing in it\u2019s own logistics service- Amazon Air and have almost 50 Boeing 767 and 737 jets as shown in below picture. They also have a Cargo ship that runs between US and China, and 25000+ Amazon Prime Vans  ",

            "answer_text": "It works well. They can\u2019t do it everywhere or for all their items. We\u2019re blessed to have Amazon distro centers north and south of our fair city and a lot of ordinary items are flagged with same day delivery, with a cutoff time and a premium for same day delivery, sweetened for Prime members. They hire drivers and their cars, $90 plus mileage for 5 hour runs is what a couple have told me, and they dispatch them with other deliveries. They email when the item goes out for delivery and If I track the order I can see the map updated with a dot showing driver\u2019s location. Amazon is simply the best at order handling, distribution, and fulfillment, has screwed up only a couple out of hundreds of orders, seldom misses a delivery date from their distro system, some stuff they catalog for others to fulfill is usually good too\u2026 ",
